1017241 Section : I REMEMBER I marched forward furiously, crunching underfoot frost-covered leaves and twigs. I was glad Susan, my four-year-old sister, could n't catch up. I would never make any new friends in this stupid little town if I had to keep taking her everywhere. " You 're going to be in trouble when I tell on you, " she whined, before I finally relented. <p> My family had just relocated to the cold and -- according to nine-year-old me -- unfriendly coastal town of Westport, Massachusetts. I did n't have a single pal yet. " Nobody 's going to want to hang around if I 've got a little kid I have to take care of, " I 'd argued uselessly with my mother. <p> " People are wary of newcomers in a small New England town like Westport, " my mother had explained breezily. " You 'll just have to be patient till they come around. " But I secretly wished that my mother was the one that had to carry her little sister around all the time. Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trudged down the path, towing Susan and our dog Prince through the woods toward Doctor Holt 's frozen pond. <p> I stood a little away from the other kids by the side of the ice, trying to ignore my little sister and hoping to get chosen for the hockey game. As the new kids in town, Susan and I might as well have been outlaws for the attention we received. " You better make sure your dog there does n't chase after our puck, " one of the kids growled, and needless to say, neither of the captains chose me. <p> At the other end of the ice, I skated sulkily, choking on every word of caution I had to make to my younger sister. Meanwhile, Prince had sniffed his way toward the source of the pond, where a bubbling stream kept the ice thin and treacherous. The snap, splash, and instant canine squealing called me back from my self-pitying reverie. Prince clawed desperately to find a foothold on the ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stood by, stupidly calling his name while he got weaker and weaker. <p> Suddenly ice flakes filled the air as the hockey gang 's skates scraped to a stop -- my sister had skated over and collected them. One boy prostrated himself gingerly over the ice. " Careful, John, " another boy said, but with intense concentration, John extended his hockey stick, which, to everyone 's surprise and pleasure, Prince bit hard onto. John pulled him out. <p> " You really should n't be skating down this end, " John said. " Why do n't you come play with us? " <p> " I 've got my kid sister with me, " I said, shrugging and looking at my feet. <p> " So what? " <p> And so, thanks to the quick thinking of my younger sister, who I 'd thought was a terrible burden and social impediment, Prince was saved, the ice was broken, and I was included in all the games at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince stuck in the ice <p> <p> by Colin M.
