4199141 # By morning the town of Mule City would be flooded. The children of the orphanage had decided they would stay behind. They had no one to come for them, and knew they would n't survive if separated, for all ten had been born cruel and foolish, so they chained themselves to their metal beds and chose me, the orphanage 's director, to hold on to the key. They asked me to remember them always. But when I looked at the key in my hand, I thought I must do my best to forget them. I had never turned away from the children in my short time in Mule City, and I preferred not to keep a memento. That night I left the house of quiet children and threw the key into the river that would soon rise over the hills, and I dragged my suitcase toward the steep road leading to the next town, where I hoped to find work in a school or a hospital. # The children called me Reverend Chao, though I was not a reverend and neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book they owned, titled Reverend Chao 's Survey of Good Souls. I pictured its cover as I walked, and idly mapped out the steps back to the children 's room, how far the darkness would recede once I opened the door, how long the quiet could suspend itself as I reached for the shelf. They slept at nine o'clock every evening, and tonight was no different for them. They had played this game many times before, with the help of my predecessor. In the morning he would unlock them from their beds and then give them their lessons as usual, and afterward the children would start their chores. They knew this routine so well that they hugged the chains in their sleep. # Perhaps I was not fair to characterize the children as having decided on their own to stay behind. The decision had been made for them long before my arrival. # When I first met them, I had held the same suitcase I was holding now, walking on the same road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking into Mule City, not out of it, with day looming high above. And suddenly there was a line of children, their hands linked, led at one end by Guo, the eldest boy, and Anming, the youngest girl, at the other. I say suddenly, and it was true : I was lost in the woods surrounding Mule City, and then these children appeared, all standing very still like sentinels. For the next year I would care for them, I would teach them how to draw, how to take apart numbers and build words. I would try to show them, with stories and nighttime excursions to the river, the history of the world outside our own. # But on that first day I forgot my plans for the children. I 'd been thinking, as I thought again on the road leading away from Mule City, about the bedtime story my grandfather used to tell me before he disappeared in his coal mine some years ago. A ghost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He vowed to eat them all and then digest them by the river where the sun shone brightest. When my grandfather reached this part of the story, he would pin me down on the bed, his bulbous eyes devouring my face, and I would pretend I 'd fallen asleep so he 'd stop speaking, which he always did. # I said before that I 'd never turned away from the children, but that was not true. I did try to leave once, after my second month at the orphanage. But Guo caught me and hung me from a tree. He hung me from a tree, and he watched the rope furrow my neck as he wrapped the other end of the rope around his hand. If I coughed, he tugged. If my fingers were to scratch at the rope, if my toes shifted on the chair supporting my weight, he tugged. In the third hour, I gave in : I pointed to a clay pot outside the house, and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children to their beds. The warnings about the river had by then increased in number again, and the children would wrap themselves with the heavy chains every night and hold still. The morning I tried to leave was a surprise even to myself, and I was clumsy in my exit. # I should not have crept away like a mouse, I told Guo as I hung from the tree, as I listened to the children in the house playing a quiet game. When Guo freed them, they gathered around me. I had nearly unfastened the rope from my neck. Then one of them tipped over the chair. I kicked at the air and pulled the rope over my head, and fell to the ground already chasing after the children. I picked up a large stick, but they did not separate, they sought one another with outstretched hands, they held on and then they stood still, and in my carelessness I collided with one of the children and the stick struck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or for months afterward. Only our bruises were evidence of my betrayal. The children continued their games at the orphanage, and I was able, with an unexpected stubbornness, to resume work, even as I anticipated the next time the children would panic, when they would again hand me the key. # I watched a year pass by in this manner, until finally it was time for me to leave. A month later, I was stationed in neighboring Wushan, picking apart garbage for scraps of metal. I 'd been emptying a container when the flood reached Mule City. My fellow scavengers had abandoned me for the shade of the empty municipal building across the street, clucking over warm beer and rice, their wet towels cooling their necks. How it rained constantly here. But I never paused in my work except to relieve myself. I found one hundred tin cans in one hour, and if there was something inside, I pried open the lid with the screwdriver I carried as tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd thrown into the river. I did find all sorts of keys, but never the orphanage 's key. # While I sorted through these items, I would remember other things, small things, about my first encounter with the children : I had walked down the road alone. The shadows in the trees moved unhurriedly. The sun was high and strong, and in an hour the woods would go dark, followed by a relentless rain. My suitcase, which contained very few things, had grown heavy. Even so, I kept walking. I had been on a bus for the past twelve hours, and the exercise sustained me. I would hear the river before I came to it. I had never seen a river before, and I hoped never to reach it, for my impression was that a river should only be heard, never seen. Suddenly a line of children crossed before me. They ranged in age from four to thirteen. Right away I admired the orderliness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chain apart. I stepped into the chain and stretched my hands to the children on either side of me. I urged the line to walk, and they saw that they could let me into their world. I wondered if they could sense my hunger for them. I wondered at how hungry I was for them. # Wah-Ming Chang( " The Key to the Orphanage " 38) writes in New York City and photographs everywhere.
