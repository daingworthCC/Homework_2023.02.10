1012941 INTRODUCTION <p> Lurking in the sacred groves and wild places of Gaul were the ancient Druids, who were said to have originated in the primeval forests of Britain across the turbulent waters of the channel. The Druids instructed the young in the secrets of religion, conducted public and private sacrifices, explained the law, and sentenced offenders. When Gallic nobles were ill or in danger in battle, they would resort to human sacrifice with the help of the Druids. Caesar 's armies conquered Gaul, but the power of the Druids with their mysterious gods and rituals was not easily suppressed. <p> CHARACTERS <p> GAULS <p> Celtillus <p> most powerful chief in Gaul <p> Vercingetorix <p> son and popular heir of Celtillus <p> Boduagnotus <p> chief of a tribe of Gaul <p> Bridiga <p> daughter of Boduagnotus <p> Carvillax <p> noble of Gaul <p> Divitiacus <p> noble of Gaul <p> DRUIDS <p> Cotuatus <p> chief Druid <p> Segibo <p> Druid <p> Coprax <p> Druid in charge of sacrificing <p> Vertico <p> Druid <p> ROMANS <p> Caesar <p> leader of the Romans <p> Caius <p> Roman general <p> Titus <p> Roman general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ACT I <p> 53 B.C.-Central Gaul, the territories of the Carnutes. The Druids are assembling in their consecrated area for their annual meeting. They will be electing a new chief Druid and attending to government matters, especially since the nation 's unity is in danger because the powerful chief Celtillus has alienated many Gauls. He has tried to restore the monarchy and the divinity of kings in his own person. Nobles who favor a republic ruled by an elected leader are also meeting, not far from the sacred grove of the Druids. They seek the death of Celtillus. <p> The Druids support the tradition of " Divine Kingship " because they recognize the importance of a strong leader who has the support of both the gods and the people. Vercingetorix, the young son and heir of Celtillus, is popular with the Druids and the nobles. His goal is to unite all the tribes of Gaul against the Romans. Unlike his father, he has the welfare of his nation at heart, not personal gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the future of Gaul is at stake. <p> SCENE 1 <p> A gloomy forest. The undergrowth of shrubs is thick because the branches have been laced together, creating an impenetrable living wall. Somberly robed Druids pass through a concealed entrance to their sacred meeting place, an open space encircled by huge oaks. The limbs of the trees, covered with mistletoe( which is sacred to the Druids), form a dome that lets in only a few beams of sun. Crudely garbed, rotting images of ancient gods are propped up against the trunks of the trees. The only sound to be heard is the doleful chanting of priests mourning their dead chief. This ceases when the eldest priest, Cotuatus, walks up to a wooden altar in the middle of the clearing and turns to face the assembled Druids. <p> Cotuatus : We Guuls must stand together. With the Romans invading our land, the future of Gaul is at stake. <p> Segibo : But first we must choose a new leader. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I propose that you, Cotuatus, as our eldest and most respected priest, succeed him. <p> Vertico : I agree with Segibo.( A breeze stirs the treetops, and a sprig of mistletoe dislodges from a branch high above the priests and falls to the ground, landing at the feet of Cotuatus.) <p> Segibo : Truly a sign from the gods. Nothing is more sacred to us than the mistletoe. In the name of Dis, the god of the underearth, from whom all Gauls descend, I nominate Cotuatus to be our chief Druid and to possess supreme authority among us.( The Druids all murmur their consent.) <p> Cotuatus : I am honored by your decision, and I will try to live up to your expectations and those of the gods. Let us commence now with our duties as judges. We are considered the most just men, and we must maintain the laws of our land. Bring forward the chief Celtillus, who has tried to restore the monarchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( Celtillus is brought into the clearing by two strong Druids. A tall man with an arrogant bearing, he is clad in tight-fitting red-and-blue striped pants with a red cloak over his shoulders. He has a bronze helmet decorated with two horns on his head.) <p> Celtillus : I earned the title and rights because of my courage, strength, and military skills. I command thousands of warriors, have won many battles, and have accumulated much wealth from the spoils of war. <p> Cotuatus : We Druids have always supported the divine rights of kings. But, no person and no nation can succeed for long unless it is the will of the gods. What do you say, my brother priests? <p> Segibo : Druidism and kingship go together. We are the spokesmen for the gods, and Celtillus has acted without our consent. <p> Vertico : Celtillus, you have committed a sacrilege. You assumed powers that are not yours to give, even to yourself. You have defied our laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come to us demanding your death. They want a leader who will unite Gaul against the Romans, not someone who thinks only of his own personal gain and glory. <p> Cotuatus : We have heard enough! I command that Celtillus be sacrificed. We need to assure the gods of our loyalty by giving them your life. Coprax, begin preparations to burn this arrogant chieftain as a sacrifice to Dis. Invite all who are worthy to witness the sacred event. <p> Coprax : I will moke a wicker figure in his shape that is hollow within and collect wood for the fire. <p> Cotuatus : Celtillus, what do you have to say for yourself? <p> Celtillus : I accept my fate, for I know I will be reborn in another body. I only ask that my son, Vercingetorix, be considered my successor. <p> Cotuatus : The nobles have already declared their loyalty to your son. He has the ability to organize a force against the Romans, and the welfare of Gaul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man deserves our support. Let us confer upon him the Divine Kingship. <p> Cotuatus : So be it. Inform Vercingetorix and the nobles of our decisions. Now, let us sacrifice Celtillus. The sooner we please the gods, the better it is for Gaul! <p> SCENE 2 <p> The nobles ' camp, a few miles from the Druids ' oak grove. A messenger enters Vercingetorix 's hut with news from the guests. After receiving the message, Vercingetorix turns to those who have been meeting with him. <p> Vercingetorix : I have just learned that the Druids are sacrificing my father to the gods and have proclaimed me king of the Gauls in his place. I expected their punishment of him, but I never imagined that they would give me their blessing and support. I mourn his death, but rejoice that I am free to fight the Romans. <p> Boduagnotus : I would like to offer you, noble Vercingetorix, the hand of my daughter, Bridiga, whom you have known since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you. <p> Vercingetorix : I am so pleased at your offer. I hope she will share my feelings. Bring her to me. iBridiga is brought into the hut. Vercingetorix takes her hand.) <p> Vercingetorix : Bridiga, will you be my bride and queen? <p> Bridiga : Oh, yes, if Father will consent. <p> Boduagnotus : My child, you have my blessing. <p> Bridiga :( turning to Vercingetorix) I will gladly take my place at your side. I have loved you from the time we were children. <p> Vercingetorix : Together we shall rule Gaul. After I have properly mourned my father 's death, I will send messengers to all the tribes in Gaul asking them to gather here for a celebration of our marriage. It will also be a good opportunity to discuss what actions we must take against the Romans. <p> Bridiga : I will leave to begin the preparations.( After Bridiga exits, Vercingetorix turns to his friends.) <p> Vercingetorix : Carvillax, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the memory of my father, to my beautiful bride, and to the future of Gaul. <p> Carvillax : Shall we use the skulls of our enemies that have been fashioned into drinking vessels? <p> Vercingetorix : Certainly, for this is a very special occasion.( Carvillax brings the macabre vessels out of a chest and fills them with mead.) May the gods look favorably upon the sacrifice of my father for the sake of our people and all of Gaul.( Each man raises a gold-rimmed human skull to his lips and drinks.) May we gain strength from these skulls of our slaughtered enemies. <p> ACT II <p> 52 B.C., Central Gaul. Vercingetorix and Caesar have engaged in a bitter series of battles for an entire year. Despite Vercingetorix 's efforts to unite Gaul, many Gauls have refused to fight, and some tribes have allied themselves with Caesar. <p> Although the Druids support his Divine Kingship, they can do little to aid Vercingetorix. They have made sacrifices and have asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The time when the Druids, murmuring their incantations, could stop a battle is over. Vercingetorix must face the Romans without the help of the gods and their priests. <p> SCENE 1 <p> Vercingetorix 's camp at Alesia in central Gaul. Vercingetorix has more than 80,000 men and is discussing plans with his friends and officers. <p> Vercingetorix : Caesar is camped outside our walls. What have our scouts reported, Divitiacus? <p> Divitiacus : The Romans are busy setting up camps to lay siege to Alesia. Our scouts have seen legionnaires armed with picks and shovels digging trenches and making earthen walls. <p> Vercingetorix : How many men do they have? <p> Carvillax : About 50,000. Not nearly as many as we expected. <p> Vercingetorix : That is true, but Caesar 's skill at besieging cities makes up for his lack of troops. We need as many men as possible to chase the Romans from our land. Boduagnotus, take the cavalry and recruit help from those tribes that have not yet supported us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among our people, and many will listen to you. Also, take Bridiga, your daughter and my wife, to a distant town where she will be safe. <p> Boduagnotus : I will try, but Bridigu will not leave willingly, knowing thut you are in danger. It is not the way with the women of Gaul. <p> Vercingetorix : Then I will send her to ask the Druid priests to cut mistletoe from the holy oak trees with their golden daggers on the sixth day of the moon. We will decorate our shields with this sacred plant to give us strength and courage in battle. She can not refuse to go on this important mission.( turning to Carvillax) Carvillax, bring me Bridiga so that I may tell her of my wishes and take my leave of her. <p> Carvillax : Done. <p> Vercingetorix : Divitiacus, tell our scouts to let me know immediately if there is any change in the Romans ' strategy. <p> Divitiacus : I will do as you command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 <p> Caesar 's tent. With him are the army 's officers and engineers. <p> Caesar : Lucius, I want camps built on the highest vantage points around Alesia. join them together with long trenches and strong, thick walls of earth. We must circle the town as soon as possible. <p> Lucius : The men are working day and night. I am having three trenches dug in the vulnerable areas, and the walls are being reinforced with trees and branches woven in. <p> Caesar : Good. I also want rows of ditches and pits that have sharpened, fire-hardened posts sunk in the bottom. Beyond these pits, lines of stakes topped with iron hooks and barbed points are to be driven into the ground. We must not let any more Gauls escape. <p> Caius : Our spies report that Vercingetorix has sent his trusted chieftain Boduagnotus to recruit soldiers. They also seek some sort of magic from the Druids. <p> Caesar : That 's what I expected. Lucius, prepare to build a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What about the magic of the Druids? I have heard that they can stop armies with their chanting. <p> Caesar : We must trust that our gods will protect us. Baculus, have your men construct towers on wheels. When they are completed, we will begin our siege. <p> Titus : Caesar, when will reinforcements arrive? If Boduagnotus comes with his, we will be in a real dilemma. <p> Caesar : I expect more cohorts to arrive any day. But do not worry. The odds have been against us before, and we have been victorious. Gaul will become a province of Rome before the year is over. <p> After six weeks of preparations, Caesar 's army attacks Alesia. The Romans hurl javelins, pointed stakes, lead balls, and stones from huge wooden towers. The Gauls fire arrows and throw javelins and stones. Many are killed and wounded. <p> As the Romans breach the walls of the city, Boduagnotus arrives with 250,000 Gauls. Caesar 's earthen walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving the Romans time to turn from the siege and defend themselves. <p> The Gauls rejoice at the arrival of Boduagnotus, but soon receive word that Bridiga did not get the blessing of the Druids or the sacred mistletoe. Because of discord, the priests did not meet. Disheartened, the Gauls continue to fight, but are no match for the Romans and their engineering skills. Thousands of horses and men are impaled on the pit stakes. Others are speared by expertly thrown javelins. Some Gauls manage to escape, but are attacked by several cohorts of legionnaires who have just arrived from Rome. Seeing that all is lost, Vercingetorix reluctantly prepares to surrender. <p> SCENE 3 <p> Caesar 's camp the next morning. Vercingetorix, wearing a shirt of chain mail and multi-colored trousers and armed with ornamented weapons, approaches on his warhorse decorated with rich trappings. After riding across the battlefield strewn with the fallen bodies of Romans and Gauls and circling the camp three times, he dismounts at Caesar 's tent. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Vercingetorix : With this sword I surrender myself so that you will be more lenient with my people. Your gods are more powerful than ours. I have lost the Divine Kingship. <p> Caesar : Your bravery has made you worthy to be called king of the Gauls. I accept your surrender,( turning to a guard) Lead this noble foe away and place him in chains. <p> Caesar sends Vercingetorix to Rome, where he is executed after being imprisoned for six years. The Druids, their prestige and power lost, retire to their sacred groves. <p> Author Affiliation
