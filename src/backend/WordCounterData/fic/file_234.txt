4163341 A little cool, you think, then the iron-scent takes you in, you leave your feet and let it -- early summer chill easing its ripple across your chest as if this water never held a body other than yours -- silk, silty touch, thick with minerals that knew you before your body was body at all -- was nothing, pure impulse, wanting to be known, taken, sweet weight lifted alone out to the dark middle, place you always knew, as it knew you would find yourself here, wet, untethered, eyes closed, forgetting. He already hardly remembered Kansas City or the Neil Young concert, though he was listening to Young 's ragged whine as he drove, mouthing " Helpless, " trying to trace an Etch A Sketch track home on back roads -- north, east, north, west along section lines -- the Decade CD on repeat -- trying to keep steady, straining as if blindfolded, feeling his way, then his cell phone broke in with the wrong notes. He shoved it across the seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? " " Man, rU get paranoid if I have to talk to anybody. Just let me sleep, let it go for now, Jamie. Feels like I got no skin. " Under his glasses Ben 's eyes stayed closed, but his hands jittered on his knees. The tinny first bars of " White Horses " vibrated from the seat again, beginning to blend with Neil Young 's scraggly plea. " You know you ai n't gon na sleep for a week, Benny. " Nothing. Empty dark sucking by on either side of the truck. Again the phone started up and Jamie grabbed it, flipped it open before the reftain could sound again like someone falling downstairs. " Ben 's Crab Shack, " he said. " Ben 's indisposed. " " Ben? Jamie? Where are you, man? " " Who wants to know? " " It 's Lenny, dumbass, look at the phone. You guys still below Yankton? How far are you? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last sign, Benny? -- Ah, Ben 's got nothin '. We ai n't really goin ' by road signs. " " Hey, I 'm at the Cockatoo. There 's two girls here need to get to Rapid with you. " " Was n't really planning on going past Pierre. " " Yeah, you were. " Ben leaned over. " Yeah, we were. Jamie 's cranked up tight enough to get to LA. What girls? Dancers? " " I thought you was goin ' to sleep. How d' you know what this is even about? " " He 's yellin ' loud as you are. " Jamie turned up the CD. " OK, I'U teU ' em Pierre tonight, OK? " said Len. " You can figure out Rapid later, but they got ta get outa here. I got the other surprise for you guys. Call me when you know where you are. " Four in the pickup cab, one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in back at Yankton were on the skinny side. The stony blond one with the silk cover-up kept her shiny heels on, crossing and recrossing long legs every so often, liquid fabric rippling under the dashlights. The younger one in sweats. Amber, had kicked her shoes off and started some kind of head-tting, shoulder-rolling routine next to Jamie, still thanking him over and over, laughing about Len 's starting a scuffle to distract their boss. She leaned forward to tune in something on the radio. " Damn fingernails get in the way of everything. They 're hardly worth it. " " No station 's gon na last long anyway, " said Jamie. She turned to look at him, then reached a hand up to his head, combed her fingers through his hair as if she were trying to figure out what kind of fixing up he could use. He slowed down for a stoplight, a one-stop hamlet, took a look in her eyes, and smued. Yellow-to-red light glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes glittered again as she crossed her legs the other way : Mary Jane. Jamie accelerated, watching for a county road west. " Oh -- " Amber put a hand on his shoulder and craned her neck around. " Did you see that couple in the car at the gas station? Their hands moving every which way? They were having an argument in sign language, I swear to god. What if you could n't say words, if you had to use your hands for everything, even to argue? My god, it breaks my heart to think about it. " " Amber, shut up. You 're nothing but exaggeration, " said Mary Jane. " Nobody you know uses words anyway. Stop running your mouth. -- S o -- " she tilted her head to Jamie -- " how far you taking us? " then looked straight ahead again. " ril get Amber to chill. " " Amber do n't need to chill, " said Ben. " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who asked your opinion, fat boy? " " OK, I 'm driving here, and I need some calm " said Jamie. " Heard of manners, Mary Jane? I had enough arguments in my head already. Setfle down or I 'll dump you out on the Rez up ahead. My nerves was scorched before you two got in. Keep it peaceful, OK? " No reply. " They got a few cops on the Rez roads now that ai n't just Tribal Police tooling through checking ditches. Some Feds happen along, we 'd make their night. Just be nice and let me drive. -- Ben, you go to work on sleeping, pal, or I 'll drop you off along with these two. There, watch the signs : thirty-one miles to Rosebud. Somebody light a cigarette? " " Sure, honey, " said Amber, reaching the pack from the dashboard, then shaking it. " It 's your last one here, " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Advil. " " No, thanks. I just want to go along easy. I can probably take you where you 're headed if things steady out. Ca n't go home yet anyhow. Just do n't want to get stopped. " " Yeah, we 're illegal too, you know. " " Too? -- Do n't exactly reassure me, but I appreciate your gettin ' things out in the open. " He took a draw. " So you want to talk? Maybe tell me a story -- how you came to be illegal, maybe. -- You too, Mary Jane, if you want -- you can make it up, tell somebody else 's story... how 'd you wind up in Yankton anyway? " He looked at Amber, then back through the windshield at the white line directing them into the dark. " -- People do n't just appear in Yankton on purpose. Ben 's gon na catch some winks. I 'll focus on the road, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mary Jane snorted quietly. " I 'm a singer, really. " said Amber. She waited a beat. " Want to hear something? Something slow, maybe? " " No, " snapped Mary Jane. " Come on, Mary Jane. Mary Jane -- Amber -- those your real names? " " Why ca n't you go home? " asked Amber. She waited again. " Mary Jane 's real name is Stella, but they already had a Stella, d' you believe it? " " We 're going to Rapid City, then Denver. -- And you do n't know my name. " " We 're goin ' to Rapid City because I told you I got a friend there we can stay with, so lighten up, OK? " " -- But Amber 's your real name? " Jamie asked. " Is Amber how you started out? " " Started out what? " She leaned forward again and stared up at him, unzipped her sweatshirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amazing she could smell like flowers after the Cockatoo. He could n't quite see what she had on, but he felt her bare arm brush the hair on his arm. " I mean, is that the name your momma gave you? " " I do n't have a mama, but I got named Rosa, and I hated it, so I changed it to Amber. " " What 's wrong with Rosa? -- Not that Amber ai n't nice. " " Jesus. " Mary Jane switched on the CD player, three chords repeating, starting up " Heart of Gold " again. " I do n't know, " Amber whispered. " We just both had to go at the same time. " " How come? " " I 'll tell ya later. " " -- She 's asleep, ai n't she? " Amber looked sideways at Mary Jane, then put her hand and mouth up to Jamie 's ear. " She was stealing from customers, and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in one motion Mary Jane had a blade at Amber 's throat, and Amber was sucking in breath, her fingernails piercing Jamie 's leg. He grabbed the wrist with the blade, pushed it toward the windshield, then pulled the truck over with his other arm, across the empty oncoming lane. Along patchy gravel the pickup slid and skidded sideways. " /sus, " yelled Ben, the two women 's weight pressing him into the door as the blade, a little blood on it, dropped along Amber 's sweatpants to the pickup floor. Jamie grabbed Mary Jane 's arm up higher, at her wiry bicep. " All right, OUT -- NOW -- and put your hands on the side of the fucking TRUCK, MJ. Everybody OL/T -- Ben --? " -- Jamie pushed Mary Jane over toward him, then slammed the truck into park and reached down for the switchblade. Ben dragged her long body out, tripping and shaking, and pulled her back to flie side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, starting tofriskwith the other. " Get your hands off me, you sweaty creep -- " She was kicking backwards, stabbing at his thighs with a high heel. " WHAT the FUCK? -- THIS IS THE DEAL, MJ, " Jamie screamed into the empty night. " K)) w want a RIDE, you hehave and be grateful, or you 're out here on your satin butt, where they ai n't got NO patience with satin. You understand me? " " You the cops now, are you? " Her voice was dark, steady. " You think I do n't know from Len about you? " " I swear to GOD, I do n't need this -- ride nice or you can get yourself some blisters. That is IT. " She eyed him, then shimmied Ben 's slackened arm off, straightened her kimono dress, retied the sash, climbed back up in the truck and looked through the black windshield as if she might see her way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver 's side and sit in between these two, wOl ya? Put a leg across MJ to keep her still. You got any more bright ideas? " " One last chance to let us save her from herself, then sacrifice. " " Benny, you 're the one told Len we 'd take these freaks, remember that. " " I 'm not the same as her, " said Amber, quietly, firmly. " I know. " Jamie stepped back, touched her shoulder and gestured to the truck. " After you. " He turned the engine over, CD kicking in again. Missed that shift on the long decline -- " Ghrist " said Jamie. After a time Amber half-whispered, " So you want to hear the sad tale about why I changed my name? " " I do, yeah. In a little bit. " Jamie took a swig from his bottle of warm iced tea, recalling the station and the drink machine he 'd bought it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a call from Marty, a clean connection. " Benny, what was it you heard from Marty last night? " " Just that message she left while we were at the concert. I told you. Said she had to work nights all this week. That was it. " " Why 's she put up with that crap? Been five years there, ai n't it? " " Who 's Marty? " asked Amber. " Somebody 's sweetie? " " Jamie 's ex, " said Ben. " My cousin. " " God help her, " said Mary Jane. " Hey, I got ta pee. " " Ah -- should'a relieved yourself back there when I had to relieve you of your damn shank, MJ. We are gon na just drive a while now, OK? From here till maybe Wanblee, you really got ta go, you 'll have to pick out a tumbleweed to squat behind. " " You goin ' reservation roads all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no state coppers, at least. And we can keep ol ' MJ in suspense. Let her see the moon fade over the spooky buttes -- might change your world view, MJ. " " OK if I put in this Springsteen CD for a change? " Amber 's head was down at an odd angle, her hands shuffling through plastic cases on the shelf below the dash. " No. Try a different one. That 's got a bad gash on it. " Jamie would n't say it was n't for other people to hear, the long dark undertow of " The River. " That it was for driving alone, listening without admitting that it was Marty and him before he started hearing the song as true, before he no longer wanted to want to recall Marty in the dusk, under swallows circling and diving to the bluff. He did n't want anybody, not even himself, knowing he remembered ; just wanted it left as music no one else heard, Marty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick bronze shimmer of hair, walking down to the water. Amber switched to radio fuzz, tried dialing around again, all of it sounding like coils of barbed wire. " Radio Nowhere, " said Ben. " Rez, loud and clear. " Amber dipped her head again, rested it on Jamie 's knee to pick through the other CDs, then gave up on them. For a long while nothing but the sound of asphalt humming under them. Gradually, outside the window next to MJ, a long pink line of dawn began thickening, growing fluorescent, as the panel dials in front of Jamie paled. The cab 's interior was more or less visible now, and he glanced over at MJ, Ben 's big leg on her skinny thighs that were n't crossed anymore. She was still staring ahead like a zombie, or maybe staring back, her face in the early light looking more than its age, her scarred jaw set, something locked there for good a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lashes, too pretty for her face, it seemed to Jamie. He looked again at the road, feeling the rush dimming like the dashboard lights, knowing rest was a dream, though, distant as whatever MJ was looking into. All this was foolishness, he knew, all a piece of nonsense Neil Young or Springsteen would 've shaken his head over but not mocked. Would 've made tragical, made known somehow, this vague longing, not knowing anymore what for. A couple of cars passed going the other way, then nothing again but bitten blacktop and prairie. The question of whether to keep going north and try to drop Lenny 's shit at the farm without MJ pulling something, that was long gone. Go on to Rapid and get rid of these two before you 're really just going on fumes, thought Jamie. No sense considering the accident of Amber, new handful he knew he should n't explore. He 'd seen the track marks in the radio-glow when she moved her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network, even on her right arm, for someone who seemed so naive. He looked over at her face, then ahead, then in the mirror there was a car behind them suddenly, one of the two that had just passed going the other way, he was certain. He watched in the rearview, slowing down. The car behind slowed down with him, making no move to pass. " Ladies, this guy on my ass, this some unhappy customer of yours? " Amber started to twist around. MJ reached across Ben and grabbed her chin. " You want to be seen, do you? You do n't even have papers, little dimwit. " " I swear he came from the other direction and turned around to foUow us. " " Man, take it easy, " said Ben. " It ai n't a Rez car, Ben. It 's a brand new big Dodge. He do n't live out here. " " That 's not the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't either of ' em. Come on, Jamie, just drive. " Full daylight, shimmering grasses bending with the wind, dew lifting off them. The purple concert stamp on Jamie 's hand was smeared over with blood from the switchblade closed in his pocket now. In the curve of his palm around the steering wheel the cut had been swelling. Hours before the passengers got in he had felt his heart beating too hard, echoing in his head, messing up his vision ; music could n't settle it. Amber 's earrings now, fake feathers, swung next to him when she moved. Easy, they were saying, you can breathe, you can ride this out OK. Ben 's phone started up. " All electronic devices off, " said Jamie. " They mess with my instruments. " " It 's Joey. " " Ah, OK. Let me talk to him then. " Ben passed the phone across. " Hey pal -- it 's Jamie. Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got my phone off. Can you hear me? Just a second, we 're coming up on a rise. We 're down on Rosebud, though. Might cut out any minute. " He looked back again at the car behind. " I do n't think I'U be home tonight, but sure, just tell me what they said they need, I can take a load up there next week. Sorenson 's got two silos full of our grain -- so much left yet we did n't sell. Last year 's prices was terrible. How much do they want -- how many head they got right now, do you know? " " Grain " said Mary Jane. " Head. " Jamie looked over at her. Ben 's leg was still lying across her like a log. " Corn, " said Ben. " Head of cattle. Who the hell are you? " he said. She was still pretending there was no Ben. " Yeah, I 'm halfway to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably wo n't have much phone reception for quite a while comin ' and goin '. I 'll just talk to you then, OK? If my dad asks, just tell him we were late from Kansas City and had to stop somewhere. Give Travis a slug for me. Ask him to feed the horses, will ya? " He shut Ben 's phone off all the way, flipped it closed and tossed it up on the dash, then put his uncut fist up against the bridge of his nose and pushed, to quiet the throbbing. He pointed to the glove compartment. " Reach in there -- there 's a new pack of cigarettes. Have one if you want, " he told Amber. " What 's this? This what Lenny gave you? " " I do n't know, just get me a cigarette. Get yourself one too. " " I got my own. I 'm sorry, I 'm not that nosey. I just get so fidgety. Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's light? That keeps me quiet. " " No -- I mean, yes. I hate that smell. You do n't have to be quiet. What were you gon na tell me about your name? " he asked, as Mary Jane 's cell emitted a piercing ring. " No -- come on -- ca n't even believe they 're workin ' out here. " " Yeah? " Mary Jane listened into her phone, ignoring him. Amber shifted toward Jamie, then forward to watch Mary Jane. Amber 's curly hair along his forearm felt like light thrown off a sparkler, a word in cursive written in the air, dazzling then disappearing. " I 'm not listening. " MJ snapped her phone shut. Amber leaned back, put her head against Jamie 's shoulder. " Too predictable, MJ, " he said, and Amber laughed, one sound, and the brief friction of her curls beside him ; then everything was Quiet for a long spell ; nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shacks ; morning wind lifting a peregrine over a few trailers circled around a broken-off lamppole. A dog ran out of a sway-backed barn, tearing toward the road, almost into it, yapping nuts beside the truck, then following their dust a quarter mile with its high-pitched scolding. Jamie 's left thumb on the steering wheel tapped a rhythm against the dog 's accusation, and it fell behind. The scorching that had drawn up into his chest and head had eased a little, as pain swelled into the gash on his hand. He lifted his bottle of tea and tipped it high for the last swig. " What does anybody do out here? " He had thought she was sleeping. Her head stayed on his shoulder, patient for an answer. " Nothin '. Drink. Smoke crank, or snort it -- shoot it, if they can get needles. The old ladies make these beautiful quilts. Ah, there 's folks clean, but there ai n't no work and the families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you, like MJ there, as say hello, especially if you 're white. " Nothing from Mary Jane. " And why not? A white commits a crime here. Tribal government ca n't prosecute. Ask Ben. He 's from up on Cheyenne River Rez, northeast of here -- I lived with him summers when we were kids, but he knows what it 's really like. A little less depressed than this, but no place to be either. " Ben was silent, eyes shut under his glasses. " Is he Indian? " " Some. His wife 's full-blood Lakota. " " Sounds kinda like Juarez, except more room to breathe. " " That where you come from? How old are you anyway? Wipe off your makeup and you 're younger than my daughter, probably. " " You got a daughter? " " Yup. " " You treat her nice? " " I try to, yeah -- I delivered her, you know? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah, her mom said there was n't gon na be time to make it to town, and I 'd helped enough calves into the world, figured I knew what to do. Sherry was n't too tough. A little more nerve-wracking than a calf, though -- your own kid. First thing I seen of her was bright red hair. Tiny, but a redhead right off the bat. " " Oh sweet. There 's a lot of girls pay good money to be redheads. She 's lucky. " " And she ai n't a hothead, either. " " Her mom a redhead? " " No. Could you get me another cigarette lighted there? " An old man who 'd been walking toward them along the road was close enough for a second that they could see the furrows in his face, his eyes not noticing their pickup coming at him, concentrating instead on something beyond, feet scuffing gravel, his pace determined. " What is thatV said Mary Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an audible breath. Rising abruptly fi-om the prairie like a long barren mirage, the jagged span of striped buttes and spires -- unearthly, a sequence of Hendrix licks made visible, frozen in air. " That 's the Badlands -- start of the Badlands. Good spot to get dropped off and die of thirst or something worse if you try another fast one, MJ. Rapid 's about an hour past there, if we do n't have no more delays. Where do we deliver you two strangers? " " Hard to believe it 's the same planet after that. " " Something finally gets a rise out of MJ, " said Ben, stretching, shifting his leg down across her shins. " I got an address, my girlfi-iend from El Paso -- " said Amber " -- kind of a sister -- she 's got a house in Rapid City with some friends. Finally left my dad, like I did a long time ago, but she got some money out of him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to come on too. I was almost to her when I got stuck in Yankton, then spent all my pay on a car graphic my ex-boyfriend liked. She 'd let you guys crash too if you want to -- I know she would. Is Rapid a nice town? My boy 's coming up to stay, once I get settled someplace. " " No wayyow got a kid. " " Yeah, Buddy. He 's gon na come and live with me. " " Well, Rapid 's better than Yankton for sure then. Less trouble, more scenery -- got the Black Hills around it. Mount Rushmore 's something for a kid to see, whatever you think of it. Deadwood 's about half an hour farther into the hills -- big gamblers come up there, famous people, movie stars. If you reach down under the seat there, I think there 's a map you can look at. You ought to take him up Spearfish Canyon. " Amber bent over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Jamie realized that the car approaching from the spires ' shadows was in the wrong lane. He was sure it was. He swerved right, and Amber shrieked from below the dash as brakes screamed, the other car ripping into the bed of the pickup, lurching them in the opposite direction, then back across the ditch and into the road again, turning counterclockwise a long time, too slowly, metal and glass thundering and shattering behind them like a long stormline erupting over and over in their heads, finally beginning to settle down as Jamie understood they 'd stopped slamming too. Blood in his eyes, he could taste it in his mouth ; saw Ben holding bloody MJ, their hair full of window-bits, but both of them looking unbroken, both staring as he reached down to touch Amber, feel her trembling, then put his whole hand on her back, his hand shaking with her. Behind them now the silence was tremendous ; nothing visible in either mirror but edges of car twisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white feathers strung along them, from Mary Jane 's or Amber 's bag thrown open. " No -- nobody move yet, " she said. " No hospitals, OK? " He wanted in that moment to love her, so grateful was he to hear her words ; they could 've been any words at all. He wanted never to know another person again but her. He found the latch and shoved open the door, slid slowly down out of the cab and tried to reach her small body toward him, over the drive shaft and under the steering column. Her face was bleeding, but she was looking at him, almost smiling, then saying " Wait. " Marty had said that the night the two of them had first made out in Ben 's car and Jamie had n't understood that her necklace was caught on a rip in the upholstery. Laughing, walking down to the dark river was how that confusion had ended, starting everything that had lasted even through the honeymoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the second floor at St. Mary 's, before taking the stairs back down to the detox unit, living those days in the hospital basement with old guys like Jack, in after a four-day puking bender with his pal who never woke up again. " Jamie, wait, " she had said. " You do n't have to do it this way. They 're making you old too, already. It was n't your fault, anyway -- it was n't even your fault, " she had said to him every night when he came upstairs. For a long time she had said that. In the side mirror he saw the old man with the furrowed face walking back, looking over the smashup. " You got a cell phone in there? " the old guy hollered into the feathered car. Jamie 's hand was on Amber still. " Give it here to me, " the old man was saying, reaching his arm through the other driver 's splintered window. Jamie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair.
