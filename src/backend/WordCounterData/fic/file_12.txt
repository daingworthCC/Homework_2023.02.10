1001541 THE BLUE AND WHITE THRONG of people all dressed up in Louis XV costumes filed by in parade. Their color bearer wore a silver wig, piled up like a pyramid, with curls falling over her forehead, and the train of her satin dress dragged dirtily along the asphalt. The black bass drummer bowed deeply before the two women leaning over the window sill and continued along with his three-cornered hat, whirling his sweaty cape in the air. <p> " He liked you, " said the girl, turning to the woman who was still clapping. " He paid you the compliment. Did you see how elegant he was? " <p> The black woman grinned slightly. <p> " My man 's a thousand times more handsome, at least I think so. <p> And he must be on his way already. He 's supposed to pick me up on the corner at ten o'clock. If I 'm late, he 'll start to get drunk and that 'll be it, he 'll be out of it for the rest of the night. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to the bedside table. The room was a jumble, as if some thief had broken in and emptied the drawers and boxes. <p> " I 'm way behind, Lu! This costume 's such a pain... You 're going to have to help a little. " <p> " But are n't you done yet? " <p> Sitting on the bed, the girl spread the green ballet skirt over her knees. She was wearing a bikini and mesh stockings that were also green. <p> " Finished? I still have to stick all of this on, just look... I had to go and choose this really hard Pierrette costume! " <p> The black woman came close, her hands smoothing the shining silk of her kimono. She wore a red crepe paper chrysanthemum stuck in her kinky hair. She sat down next to the girl. <p> " Raimundo should be getting there any time now. He goes through the ceiling when I 'm late. We 're going to see the paraders, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Take it easy, you have time, " interrupted the girl. She brushed away the hair that fell over her eyes. She stood up the lamp that had fallen over on the table. " I ca n't imagine where the time has flown. " <p> " But Tatisa, you know I ca n't miss the parade. Anything but miss the parade! " <p> " And who 's saying you 're going to miss the parade? " <p> The woman stuck her finger in the pot of glue and placed it softly on the sequins in the saucer. She quickly raised her finger to the ballet skirt where she was forming a random constellation. She caught a sequin that had fallen away and gingerly touched it to the glue. She placed it on the ballet skirt, fixing it in place with small circular movements. <p> " But if I have to fasten the sequins to the whole ballet skirt.. " So you 're already complaining, are you? I thought I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done, see?... It 'll only take a second if you help. I 've already put on my make-up. Look here, how 's my face? You 're not saying? Why, you witch! Come on... How do I look? " <p> The woman smiled. <p> " You look pretty, Tatisa. That green in your hair makes me laugh. <p> You 're starting to look like an artichoke. But I do n't like that green on your nails. It 's weird. " <p> In a sudden movement, the girl raised her head to catch her breath and passed the back of her hand over her flushed face. <p> " But the nails are what make it special, silly. It 's a green dance, the costumes have to be green... everything has to be green. But you do n't have to keep staring at me. Come on, do n't stop. You can talk, but keep working. It 's not even half done, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses, and I ca n't see straight without my glasses. " <p> " It 's all right, " the girl said, wiping away with her handkerchief the excess glue running down her finger. " Just keep gluing. There 'll be so many people there that nobody 'll notice. This heat is driving me crazy, I ca n't take it any more, I feel like I 'm melting, do n't you? This heat 's incredible! " <p> The woman tried to attach the chrysanthemum that had worked its way down to her neck. She wrinkled her forehead and lowered her voice. <p> " I went in there <p> " And? " <p> " He 's dying <p> A car passed by in the street, with its horn honking frantically. <p> Some boys broke into singing at the top of their lungs to the rhythm they were beating on a frying pan : The king 's crown is n't gold, and it is n't silver either.... <p> " I feel like I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her nostrils beaded with sweat. " If I 'd known, I 'd have made a lighter costume " Lighter than that? You 're almost naked, Tatisa. I was going with my Hawaiian costume, but just because a little bit of thigh shows Raimundo makes accusations. So imagine you... " <p> With her fingernail, Tatisa picked off a sequin that had gotten caught in the mesh of her stocking. She let if fall onto the small constellation that she was arranging on the hem of her ballet skirt and pensively kept rubbing a drop of dried glue that had fallen on her knee. Her eyes wandered over the objects, without focusing on any of them. She spoke in a somber tone : <p> " Do you think so, Lu? " " Do I think what? " <p> " That he 's dying. " <p> " Oh, yes. He is. I 'm sure of it. I 've seen a whole bunch of people die, and I know all about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " But you were wrong once before. Remember? You said he was going to die, that he was at the end of the line... And the next day he was just radiant, asking for milk first thing. " <p> " Radiant? " she asked with surprise, pursing her red-violet lips. " And I did n't say he was going to die. Just that he was real sick. That 's what I said. But today is different, Tatisa. I looked in on him from the door. I did n't even have to go in to see that he was dying. " <p> " But when I went in there he was sleeping so calmly, Lu. " <p> " That 's not sleep. It 's something else. " <p> The girl stood up, brusquely shoving away the ballet skirt spread on her knees. She went to the table, grabbed the bottle of whiskey and looked for a glass amid the jumble of flasks and boxes. She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face powder that dusted the bottom, filled the glass and, clenching her jaw, gulped down the whiskey. She took some breaths with her mouth open. She turned to the black woman. <p> " Do you want some? " <p> " I already had a lot of beer. If I mix drinks I get sick to my stomach. " <p> The girl poured more whiskey into her glass. <p> " Is my make-up running? Look and tell me if I 've smeared the green on my eyes. I 've never sweated so much, I can feel my blood boil. " <p> " You 're drinking too much, and in such a hurry... Besides, I do n't know what the point is of this spangled ballet skirt. The sequins are all going to fall off in the crowd. And I ca n't do a very good job while I 'm thinking about Raimundo there on the corner. " <p> " Lu, you can be such a bore! You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blab, blab, blab! Ca n't that guy wait just a little? " <p> The woman did n't answer. She listened, transfixed by the music of a carnival group passing by in the distance. They sang in falsetto : She wound up crying... she wound up crying... <p> " In the last carnival I joined a group on the street and I had a really good time. I even ruined my shoes from so much dancing " And me in bed, stinking sick with the flu, remember? This time I want to do it right. " <p> " And your father? " <p> The girl was slowly cleaning the white glue from her fingertips with a handkerchief. She took a drink of whiskey. She stuck her finger back in the pot. <p> " You just want me to stay here and cry. Am I right? Shall I cover my face with ashes and stay here praying? Is that what you want? " She stared at her fingertip covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ballet skirt. " What can I do? I 'm not God, am I? If he 's gotten worse, is it my fault? " <p> " I 'm not saying it 's your fault, Tatisa. It 's none of my business. He 's your father, not mine. Do what you think is best. " <p> " But you started in saying that he 's dying. " <p> " Well, he is. " <p> " He is not! I looked in on him too. He 's sleeping, and no one dies sleeping that way. " <p> " Okay, then. Whatever you say. " <p> The girl went to the window and turned her face to the purple sky. On the sidewalk, a group of boys played with plastic banana-shaped tubes, squirting water in each other 's faces. They interrupted the game to razz a man passing by dressed up as a woman, with his feet spilling over the sides of his high-heeled shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! " shouted the oldest boy, running after the man. She witnessed the scene with indifference. She yanked up the stockings attached to the elastic of her bikini. <p> " I 'm sweating like a horse. I swear if I had n't already made myself up I 'd jump in the shower. It 's stupid to put on make-up ahead of time. " <p> " And I 'm so thirsty I ca n't stand it, " whined the maid, drawing up the sleeves of her kimono. " Oh, for an ice-cold beer. I really like beer, but Raimundo prefers cachaca. Last year, he stayed drunk for the whole three days, and I went alone to the parade. I saw the prettiest float you could imagine. It was supposed to be the sea. You should have seen that mountain of mermaids covered with pearls. It had <p> fisherman, it had a pirate, it had an octopus, it had everything! And right up on top, inside a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sea covered with jewels... " <p> " You were wrong once before, " interrupted the girl. " He ca n't be dying, he ca n't. I was there too, before you. He was sleeping so peacefully. And early today he even recognized me, he kept looking at me, looking at me, and then he smiled. ' Are you okay, poppa? ' I asked, and he did n't say a word, but I could see that he understood every word. " <p> " He made himself out to be strong, the poor guy. " <p> " What do you mean, ' made himself out '? " <p> " He knows that you have your dance to go to, and he does n't want to get in the way. " <p> " Oh, stupid people are so hard to talk to, " exploded the girl, throwing on the floor the clothes that she had piled on the bed. She rifled through some pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I have my own brand, I do n't need yours. " <p> " Listen, Luzinha, listen : ' she began, adjusting the flower in the woman 's kinky hair. " I 'm not making this up. I 'm sure that this very morning he recognized me. I think that at the time he felt some pain, because I saw a tear running down his paralyzed side. I 've never seen him cry on that side before, never. He cried just on that side, such a dark tear. " <p> " He was saying good-bye. " <p> " Shit, there you go again! Stop being such an old crow. It seems like you 'd like it to happen today. Why do you have to keep going on like that, why? " <p> " You ask for my opinions, but you do n't want my answers. I 'm not going to lie, Tatisa. " <p> The girl looked under the bed. She pulled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green hair was brushing the floor. She stood up, looked around, and kneeled slowly in front of the black woman. She picked up the pot of glue. <p> " How about popping over just to see? " <p> " Do you want me to finish this or not? " the woman moaned in exasperation as she opened and closed her glue-parched fingers. " Raimundo hates to wait, and he 's going to really lay into me <p> The girl got up. She grumbled and paced back and forth like a caged animal. She kicked a shoe that she found in her way. <p> " That worthless doctor. It 's all that faggot 's fault. I told him that I could n't stay with him here at home. I told him I did n't know how to take care of sick people, I do n't have the knack, I ca n't do it! If you were nice to me, you 'd help me, but you think only about yourself. You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes to everything. You 're so selfish! " <p> " But, Tatisa, he is n't my father. It 's not my business. And I 've helped a lot, yes ma'am, what do you mean I have n't? Who took all that grief for all those months? I 'm not complaining, because he 's a good man, the poor guy. But I 'm sorry, I 've got other things to do. I should be outside, not stuck in here doing all this. " <p> Looking very weary, the girl opened the door of the wardrobe. She pinched her waist as she examined herself in the mirror. <p> " I 've gotten fat, Lu... " " Fat, you? But you 're just skin and bones, honey. Your boyfriend does n't have anything to hang on to. Or does he? " <p> She moved her hips suggestively. She laughed. Her eyes brightened : " Lu, Lu, for the love of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midnight. He had a green Pierrot costume made. " <p> " I also dressed up as a Pierrot once. But that was a long time ago. " <p> He 's coming in a Typhoon, is n't that chic? " <p> " What 's that? " <p> " It 's a really nice car, red. But do n't just stand there looking at me. <p> Hurry, Lu. Do n't you see that... " She anxiously ran her hand over her neck. " Lu, Lu, why did n't he stay in the hospital!? He did so well in the hospital. " <p> " That 's how hospital care is when it 's free, Tatisa. They ca n't spend their whole life with a sick person who does n't get any better. There are sick people standing in line, all the way to the sidewalk. " <p> " I 've been thinking about this dance for months. He 's lived sixty-six years. Ca n't he live just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the ballet skirt and examined it from a distance. She spread it out on her lap again and bent over the saucer full of sequins. <p> " There 's just one part left to do. " <p> " One more day.... " <p> " Come help me Tatisa, with both of us gluing it 'll be done in an instant. " <p> They both began working faster now, their hands coming and going from the glue pot to the saucer and from the saucer to the ballet skirt, curved like a green wing, heavy with sequins. <p> Gluing the sequins haphazardly, the woman spoke again : " Raimundo 's going to kill me today Then she wiped her wet forehead with the back of her hand and asked, without letting it down, " Did you hear that? " <p> The girl did n't respond for some time. <p> " What? " <p> " It sounded like a moan. " <p> She lowered her eyes. <p> " It was in the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow light of the lamp. <p> " Listen, Lu, if you could stay here today, just for today..., " she began in a gentle voice. She quickly added : " I 'd give you my white dress, that white one of mine, you know which one? And also the shoes, they 're still new, you know how new they are. You can go out tomorrow, you can go out every day, but, for the love of God, Lu, stay here today! " <p> The maid sat straight up in triumph. <p> " It was n't easy, Tatisa, but it 's done. I 've been looking forward to this for so long. Today I would n't stay even if you killed me, not today. " Her chrysanthemum slipped as she shook her head. She fastened it with a bobby pin that she opened on her front teeth. " Miss the parade? Never! I 've already done a lot for you, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay, you can put it on now. It 's a lousy job, but nobody 's going to notice. " <p> " I could give you the blue coat, " murmured the girl, cleaning her fingers on her handkerchief. <p> " I would n't stay at home even if he were my own father, do you hear me, Tatisa? Not even if it were my own father, not today. " <p> The girl jumped up, went to the bottle and gulped down some more with her eyes closed. She put the ballet skirt on. <p> " Agh! This whiskey is fire, " she growled, going near the mirror. <p> " Come on, come here and button me up. You do n't have to go out with that guy. You pain in the neck. " <p> The woman 's fingers fumbled in the tulle. <p> " I ca n't find the hooks... " <p> The girl stood in front of the mirror, her legs apart, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mirror 's reflection : <p> " No way is he dying, Lu. You did n't have your glasses on when you went in the room, did you? So you did n't see well. He was sleeping. " <p> " It 's possible I was wrong <p> " Of course you were wrong. He was sleeping. " <p> The woman wrinkled her forehead, wiping the sweat off her chin with the sleeve of her kimono. Like an echo she repeated : <p> " Yes, he was sleeping. " <p> " Hurry up, Lu, you 've been at those hooks for about an hour. " <p> " You 're all set, " said the woman, quietly, as she moved toward the door. " You do n't need me any more, do you? " <p> " Wait! " ordered the girl, quickly putting on her perfume. She touched up her lips and threw the brush down next to the uncapped vial. " Now I 'm ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to go, Tatisa! " " Wait, I just nay told you that I 'm ready : ' she repeated, lowering her voice. " All I need is my purse. " <p> " Are you going to leave the lights on? " <p> " It 's better to leave them on, is n't it? The house looks cheerier that way. " <p> At the top of the stairs they drew closer. They looked in the same direction. The door was closed. Motionless as if they 'd been turned to stone in their flight, the two women stood looking at the living room clock. The black woman was the first to move. She whispered : <p> " Do you want to take a peek, Tatisa? " <p> " You go, Lu <p> They exchanged fleeting glances. Drops of sweat ran down the green temples of the girl, a murky sweat like the juice of a lemon peel. <p> Outside the long blast of a horn was fading away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maid softly pulled away from the girl 's hand. She went down the stairs on tip-toe and opened the door to the street. <p> " Lu! Lu! " the girl cried out with alarm. Controlling herself to keep from screaming, she called, " Wait there, I 'm coming. " <p> And, using the handrail as support, glued to it, she quickly went down the steps. When she slammed the door behind her, a few green sequins rolled down the steps in the same direction, as if trying to catch her. <p> Translated by Leland Guyer <p>
