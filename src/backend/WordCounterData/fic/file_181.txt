Cassie Logan : Little Man, would you come on? You 're gon na make us late. Narrator 2 : He lags behind his brothers and sister because, to take each step, he lifts his leg high and then gingerly places it down in the dust. Six-year-old Little Man hates to get dirty, especially because this is his first day of school. The other Logan children are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us late and Mama 's gon na wear you out. Stacey Logan : Hush up, Cassie. Narrator 3 : Stacey is in a foul mood this morning. First, there 's the deep heat beating down on the children in their uncomfortable Sunday clothes. But Stacey is extra irritable because today he is starting the seventh grade - the grade taught by their mama. Narrator 4 : The narrow, sunsplotched road winds before the Logans like a lazy red serpent. A barbed wire fence runs the length of the deep fields. The fence stretches east until it meets a green pasture that signals the end of the Logan family 's 400-acre property. Narr 1 : Beyond their land is a forest. Past that are acres of vast farming fields worked by sharecropping* families. All that land was once a 10-square-mile plantation owned by Harlan Granger.

She failed me. Now I got her again. Stacey : Shoot! Least you do n't have to spend all day in a classroom with your mama. T.J. : Look on the bright side. Think of the advantage you 've got. You 'll be learnin ' all sorts of stuff ' fore the rest of us... like what 's on them tests. Stacey : If that 's what you think, then you do n't know Mama. T.J. : No need getting mad. Just an idea. Narr 4 : Cassie gives T.J. a nasty look. She has never trusted him. Christopher-John Logan : Quick! Off the road! Narr 1 : Without another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forest. Little Man does not go.

Narr 2 : Little Man turns around as a school bus bears down on him. It is spewing clouds of red dust like a huge, yellow firebreathing dragon. Narr 3 : Little Man runs frantically along the road looking for a foothold, but he does n't find one before the bus speeds past him. The driver intentionally covers him in a scarlet haze while white laughing faces press against the bus windows. T.J. : laughing) Well, old Little Man done got his Sunday clothes dirty. Stacey : Aw, hush up, TJ. Cassie : Yeah, hush up, TJ. Narr 4 : The kids climb back down to the road, where Little Man is fighting back tears. Little Man : How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they like to see us run, and it ai n't our bus. Little Man : Where 's our bus? Stacey : We ai n't got one. Little Man : Why not? Stacey : Ask Mama when we get to school. Now let 's go. SCENE 2 Narr 1 : After school, the family members pick cotton in their field. Cassie has shimmied up a thin wooden pole to reach a puff at the top of a tall stalk. Big Ma : Cassie, you better watch yourself, girl. Sho ' better not fall. Cassie : I 'm not gon na fall, Big Ma. Narr 2 : Cassie scoots up the pole to see over the field to the road, where two male figures walk briskly toward them. One is much taller than the other. Cassie recognizes the familiar, fluid gait of the shorter one. Narr 3 : She slides down the pole, landing with a thud, and then scrambles to the road. Cassie : Papa! Papa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her with delight. Big Ma : Do n't go through that fence! Narr 1 : The children ignore her. They carefully pick their way through the row of barbed wire and run swiftly into the road to their father 's open arms. Little Man : Papa, what are you doing home? Papa : Just came home to see ' bout my babies. Just look at y'all. Mr. Morrison, what you think about these children of mine? Narr 2 : Mr. Morrison is a human tree, towering high above their papa 's 6-foot-2-inch frame. His body bulges with muscles, and his skin is the deepest ebony and scarred as if by fire. Papa : Children, meet Mr. L.T. Morrison. Narr 3 : As the children stammer their helios, Mama and Big Ma approach. Mama : David, is something the matter? Papa : Something got ta be wrong for me to come see you? Narr 4 : Together, they make their way into the house, where Mr. Morrison surveys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na be home, David? Papa : Till Sunday evening. Mama : Sunday? Why, today 's already Saturday. Papa : I know, baby, but I ca n't be taking extra time away from the rail. Listen, I come home special so I could bring Mr. Morrison. He lost his job on the railroad a while back. He ca n't find anything else. I asked him whether he wanted to work here as a hired hand for a while. We ca n't afford him much, but we can give him food and shelter and maybe a little cash when I come home again in the winter. Mama : All right. Welcome to our home, Mr. Morrison. Papa : I think things being what they are, happening like they did with the Berrys, I 'd feel good knowing there 's a man around here till I get home. Cassie : Papa, what about the Berrys? Mama : Never you mind, child. Christopher-John : But, Mama... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said never mind. Go on now, and get ready for supper. SCENE 3 Narr 1 : The next morning, at the church social, Cassie hears the story about the Berrys from their neighbor Mrs. Lanier when she whispers it to Big Ma. Narr 2 : She hears that one of the Berry boys died last night from his burns. His brother and father are alive, but barely. Narr 3 : Rumor has it that some white men attacked the Berry men. The white men dragged them from their house, dumped kerosene on them, and set them aflame. All because they thought John Henry was flirting with a white woman. Narr 4 : The worst part, Mrs. Lanier says, is that everyone knows it was the owners of a local shop, the Wallace brothers, who did it. People have even heard them bragging about it. But no one from the black community dares to accuse them. Cassie pretends she is n't listening, but the disturbing news leaves her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an announcement at the supper table. Papa : In this house, we do n't shop at the Wallaces ' store. Children from our neighborhood go up there to drink liquor and smoke. Things children should never be doing. That place is nothing but trouble, and I do n't want to see any of you up at that store, you hear? Cassie, Stacey, Christopher-John, and Little Man : Yes, Pa. Narr 2 : Papa does n't mention the incident Cassie overheard that morning. Cassie knows better than to bring it up. SCENE 4 Narr 3 : November is a rainy month, which makes the children 's hour-long walk to school even more dreadful. Narr 4 : Worse still is that bus driver. He loves to entertain his passengers by sending the black children slipping up the washed-out bank, before splashing them head to toe in mud. Every morning is a cruel, humiliating experience. Narr1 : On this November morning, the Logans cross their school lawn, covered up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus incident. Stacey : whispering to the others) Meet me at the toolshed at noon. Cassie : Why? Stacey : 111 show y'all how we 're gon na stop that bus from splashing us. Narr 2 : At lunch, Cassie and her brothers meet as planned by the toolshed. They duck into the shed, and Stacey hands them shovels and buckets. Then he guides them out around the back of the school buildings and into the road. Stacey : Come on, let 's run. We do n't have much time. Christopher-John : Where we going? Stacey : Up to where that bus forced us off the road this morning. Be careful now.... All right, here we are. Start digging. Cassie, you dig over there on that side of the road. Do n't get too near the edge. It has to look like it 's been washed out. I 'll start on this end. ChristopherJohn, Little Man, start scooping out from the middle. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on time. Narr 3 : They ask no more questions. Once the trench is deep enough, they begin carting buckets of water from the gullies and dumping them in until it looks as level as the road. Christopher-John : Looks like it 's gon na rain real hard this afternoon. Narr 4 : The Logans gather their tools and hurry back to school. Narri : After school, the children meet again for their long walk home. This time, they feel a nervous excitement in their hearts. Stacey : Let 's walk the whole way through the forest. I do n't want to be anywhere in sight when that bus crashes. Christopher-John : Stacey, what if they find out we done it? Stacey : Do n't worry, they wo n't. Little Man : Hey, I think it 's coming. Narr 2 : The Logans flatten themselves completely under the bushes and watch the bus as it speeds into the puddle. It emits a tremendous thump and careens into their trap. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The Logans cover their mouths and shake with laughter as the students try to jump over the trench, misjudge it, and fall in. The driver swears and kicks the submerged front tire. Narr 4 : The Logans continue home, giggling and celebrating their sweet revenge. SCENE 5 Narr 1 : Several days later, T.J. and Stacey get into a fight. T.J. tells on Stacey for cheating on a test, and Mama punishes Stacey in front of the whole class. Narr 2 : After school, Stacey follows T.J. to the Wallaces ' store to confront him. Cassie and her brothers tag along, knowing they should not be there. Narr 3 : Outside the store, Stacey pounces on T. J., knocking him to the ground. They begin to roll around, fists flying. T.J. : Hey, man, wait a minute. Let me explain. Ai n't my fault, Stacey. Stacey : Shut up! Narr 4 : The boys continue fighting, and the Wallaces, the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Everyone is so engrossed in the fight that none of them see a mule wagon pull up and Mr. Morrison get out of it. All of the sudden, the fighting stops and there is silence. Mr. Morrison : Stacey, you and your sister and brothers get in the wagon now. Christopher-John : Oh, we gon na get it now. I told y'all we should have gone home. Narr 1 : The kids quietly pile into the wagon. Stacey : You gon na tell Mama we was here, Mr. Morrison? Mr. Morrison : No. You are. Narr 2 : The children gasp. Mr. Morrison : I wo n't tell your mama. It seems you feel you got a good reason to be up here, but I know you should n't be. Y'all owe it to her to tell her. Narr 3 : Christopher- John and Little Man protest. Cassie looks incredulously at Mr. Morrison. Stacey : All right, I 'll tell her. Christopher-John : No, Stacey, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you! Narr 4 : That night, Stacey explains everything to their mother. He does not tell her that his sister and brothers were there too. Mama : I suppose you three went along with him? That does it! Narr 1 : The children expect Mama to punish them, but instead she paces the floor angrily before sending them all to bed. The kids think they have gotten off a little easy. SCENE 6 Narr 2 : On Saturday morning, Mama wakes the children at the crack of dawn. She dresses them quickly and piles them into the wagon. Mama : Listen, children, where we 're going, the man is very sick, and he does n't look like other people. But I do n't want you to be afraid or uncomfortable around him. Just be yourselves. Narr 3 : They ride for almost two hours before arriving at the Berrys ' home. Mama knocks, but no one answers. She cracks open the door. Mama : Good morning, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elderly woman waddles up to the door. Mrs. Berry smiles wide and throws her good arm around Mama. Mrs. Berry : Land sakes, child! Ai n't you something! These your babies? Ai n't they fine! Come on in, y'all. Narri : The children follow Mrs. Berry into the dark house. Mrs. Berry : I got to cover him up. Do n't want to scare y'all. He ca n't speak no more - fire burned him too bad. But he understands all right. Narr 2 : Mrs. Berry lights a few lanterns. The light illuminates a still form with glittering eyes. The face has no nose, and the head no hair ; the skin is scarred and burned, and the lips are wizened like charcoal. A wheezing sound echoes from an opening at the mouth. Mama : Say good morning to Mrs. Berry 's husband, children. Narr 3 : The children stammer their good-mornings and try not to stare as Mama softly talks to the Berrys. She tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as normal as anybody else. After an hour, they say their good-byes and get back in the wagon. Mama : The Wallaces did that, children. They poured kerosene over Mr. Berry and his sons and lit them on fire. One of the sons died. The other is just like Mr. Berry. And everyone knows about it, and nothing was ever done. They 're bad people, the Wallaces. That 's why I do n't want you to go to that store. For any reason. Never again. Narr 4 : On the way home, Mama stops at many of the homes of her students. She talks to their parents about the bad influence of the Wallaces ' store, that the Wallaces permit children to smoke and drink there. Narr 1 : She never suggests that the Wallaces were the ones that attacked the Berrys. That, she explains, is something that everybody knows, but nobody can say. Still, she suggests that the families all boycott the store. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Mr. Granger 's land. He will back their credit only at the Wallaces ' store. The families ca n't afford to shop anywhere else. Mama thinks hard about a way to help. SCENE 7 Narr 3 : The next week, T.J. and the fading shiner around his left eye hop into the wagon with Big Ma, Stacey, and Cassie. Big Ma is taking them up to the market in Strawberry to sell the goods grown on their land. Narr 4 : Today is the first time that Cassie has ever been allowed to go to the Strawberry market. Her excitement almost makes it easy to forget that T.J. is going along too. Big Ma : Well, children, open your eyes and take in Strawberry, Mississippi! Cassie : This is it? Shoot! It ai n't nothing to shout about. Big Ma : Hush up, Cassie. In another hour this piaceli be teeming with folks from all over the county, and I do n't want no trouble. Narr 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to their family 's accountant and lawyer, Mr. Jamison, before going shopping at the market. T.J. : Why do n't we go on down to the market and walk around? Stacey : I do n't know. I think Big Ma wanted to go there with us. T.J. : Aw, shoot, man, we 'll be doin ' her a favor. We can go down to the market now and order up our stuff. We can save her some time, so when she comes from seein ' that lawyer, we can just go home. Besides, I got somethin ' to show ya. Stacey : Well, I guess it will be all right. Cassie : Big Ma said stay here! Stacey : Stay here then! Narr 2 : Cassie dashes after them. SCENE 8 Narr 3 : Mr. Barnett 's market has everything from ladies ribbons to burlap bags of seed, from baby bottles to pot-bellied stoves.

Narr 2 : Mr. Barnett begins filling the order, but before he finishes, a white woman comes and he stops to attend to her. Then another, and another white person comes. The children wait while their order goes unfinished. Cassie : What 's he doing? Stacey : Hush, Cassie. Narr 3 : Stacey looks uncomfortable, but T.J. 's face is bland, as if nothing unusual has happened. Mr. Barnett leaves to fill another order. Stacey : Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the way out, Cassie sees Mr. Barnett wrapping an order of pork chops for a white girl no older than herself. Cassie : Excuse me, Mr. Barnett. I think you forgot, but you were waiting on us before this girl here. Mr. Barnett : Well, you just get your little black self back over there and wait some more. Cassie : We been waiting for you for almost an hour, while you go around waitin ' on everybody else. It 's not fair. You got no right Narr 1 : Then Mr. Barnett bellows a nasty name at Cassie. Cassie yells back that she wo n't be called that. Stacey whispers for her to hush up. Cassie : Stacey! Tell him this ai n't fair! Mr. Barnett : She 's your sister, boy? Stacey : Yessir. Mr. Barnett Then you get her out of here. And make sure she do n't come back until your mammy teaches her what she is. Cassie : I know what I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are. Narr 2 : Stacey jerks Cassie by the arm and drags her outside the store. Cassie : What 's wrong with you? You know he was wrong! Stacey : I know it and you know it, but he does n't know it. And that 's where the trouble is. Now come on. Narr 3 : When Big Ma hears the story, she chastises Cassie. They ride home from Strawberry in silence. SCENE 9 Narr 4 : Papa comes home for Christmas and the rest of the winter. Early one morning, Cassie overhears a conversation about the boycott of the Wallaces ' store. Mama : Everybody from here to Strawberry knows it was them. But what do we do about it? We line their pockets with our few pennies and send our children up to their store to learn bad things. The least we can do is stop shopping there. Mr. Turner and the Laniers and the Averys and more than two dozen other families, they all say they 'll think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papa : Mary we go backing folks ' credit with our land, we 'd lose it for sure. Big Ma : What if I told you I spoke with Mr. Jamison about this? What if I told you he agreed to back the credit of those families if they shop at the Vicksburg store? Papa : Harlan Granger and the Wallaces are n't going to like this. Boycotting this store points a finger right at them for what they 've done. Mama : Well, that 's just too bad for Harlan Granger and the Wallaces. I know there is some risk here, but we ca n't let things like this go by unnoticed. We best go tell everybody the news and get ourselves ready for a big trip up to Vicksburg. Narr 1 : The boycott begins. Several families suddenly stop shopping at the Wallaces ' store.

Mama : ' Course they are. They 're just late, is all. Cassie : You do n't think somebody done... Mama : Maybe you children better go to bed. Little Man : But I want to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed. Narr 3 : Cassie goes to her room, but she does not sleep. She stares out the window. Mama : Something 's wrong. I can feel it. Narr 4 : Mama hears the dogs barking and opens the front door, yelling into the night. Mama : David! Mr. Morrison : Go on, Stacey. I got him.

Cassie, go to bed. Cassie : No. You tell us what happened. Stacey : We was coming back from Vicksburg when the back wheels come off. Papa and Mr. Morrison, they think somebody messed with them wheels for them both to come off the way they did. Papa thought somebody was coming after us. So Papa told me to hold the reins on Jack real tight while he changed the wheels. But Jack was skittish because of the storm. Mr. Morrison held the whole wagon up by himself, and Papa put the first wheel on. That 's when he got shot. Cassie : Who done it? Stacey : A truck come up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the wheel on. The noise from the shot scared Jack - I could n't hold him - so he reared up, and then the wagon fell on Papa 's leg. Cassie : Oh no! Stacey : It 's my fault his leg is busted. Mr. Morrison fought the other men like crazy. He picked one of them up and threw him on the ground like he did n't weight a thing. Then the men got in the truck and left. Little Man : Then what? Stacey : Nothin '. Then we put on the other wheel and come on home. Cassie : Who was it? Stacey : The Wallaces, I think. Christopher-John : Stacey, is Papa gon na die? Stacey : No, he 's just sleeping right now. Christopher-John : Well, when 's he gon na wake up? Stacey : In the morning. You just wait and see. He 'll be just fine come morning.
