1008441 The other day my father Mario brought home his new girl friend to meet the family. She was a young thing with plenty of lipstick and moxie and obvious experience. Mario was proud of his new discovery and the two were unabashedly intimate. Where he finds them I do n't know. There are bars in all the hamlets near here and my father drives around a lot at night. Then to top this he brings home his new boyfriend. You see, he visits all sorts of bars. This one at least was closer to Mario 's age. He was very unpretentious, very sweet. I liked him right off. In recent years my father has shown better taste in men than in women. All this happened in the same week, and you would think it was a pretty bad week for my mother. Surprisingly, she took it in stride. Maybe she 's gotten used to it, or is numb about this sort of thing from the kind of work she 's done for years. <p> My mother Sophie is a long-suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain in the ass than ever. We live in a small house, my mother on the first floor and Mario in the basement. I live in the garage. There 's a rug over the concrete and sheetrock up and a kerosene heater for when it gets cold. After my folks got divorced my father drifted around the Southwest for a few years until his money ran out. He came back contrite and charming and Sophie, always a charitable woman, took him back rent free but made him live downstairs. It was during his travels that Mario had certain experiences which changed his orientation, so to speak, but he never lost his taste for women. A certain kind of woman had always been attracted to him, which is what destroyed the marriage and made my mother so bitter ; my father just became more mellow and self -- satisfied than ever. After all this I think they still need each other, Mario because he likes being taken care of and Sophie because she has to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still does the laundry and Mario, I 'll give him credit, keeps the place up pretty well. Tools are one more thing he 's handy with. <p> " You know why I thank God every day for your father? " Sophie asked me. <p> " I ca n't imagine. " <p> " Because without him the devil would just be some cockamamie story. He 's my only proof the Bible is true. " <p> " You have other reasons for believing, Mama. Did n't you tell me Father Lansing is a living saint? " Father Lansing was the priest at our local parish. <p> " Kimmy, that was yesterday. A lot has happened. " <p> " What 's happened? " <p> " Another day in this freak house with your father. Jesus sweet Jesus why do you test our faith so? " <p> There were days I felt it too : freaks lived in our nicely kept home, and I did n't make an exception of myself here. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Or because of where I 'm not. I 'm twenty-four years old, with a degree in political science from a place you 've heard of and no prospects or ambitions whatever. Oh, I 'm still in touch with my alma mater. They call every couple of months or so, whenever they have a fund drive. What I tell them is they 're barking up the wrong tree. I 've taken my credential and my knowledge of government and put them to work, but I do n't make much, and there 's no upward mobility to speak of. Mobility, sure. But strictly horizontal. I drive an ice cream truck. <p> The work is easy and satisfying in unexpected ways. I make children happy and this is something new for me. It seems to answer some deep freshly exposed need. My route takes me to the more hard-up places in town and the kids are always waiting, always hungry. I do n't mean they have empty bellies, I mean they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with, temporarily. I stand in the back of the truck and look out the serving window at the crowd of dirty faces. They 're eager but they are n't fortunate. The price of a small cone is almost two bucks and it goes up from there. This seems high to me and I want to give them a break but it is n't my truck. I 'm part of a small fleet owned and run strictly for profit by a guy named Lance. Lance makes his no giveaways policy clear and he 's a big bastard, a weight-trainer, bulging out of shirts with the sleeves cut away and a tiny cross hanging in the cleft of his chest. What god he prays to I ca n't imagine. He 's a well-known tough and I do what I can to stay on his good side. I have what you 'd call a soft streak, and it 's always been that way, since I discovered as a boy I have a girl 's name. Lance plasters his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can afford. But they buy them anyway. The kids pay in nickels, quarters, sometimes a crumpled bill. They pay in pennies. They hit up their parents, many of them single moms on welfare, for whatever is lying around. Or they just take it : the cigarette money, the junk food money. Drug money maybe. My heart goes out to them. Guilty, I count the change and pass the already melting thing over the ledge. But I can see it, this temporary but real happiness. It 's the best part of the job. <p> Lance did in fact catch one of the other drivers red-handed giving away ice cream to his friends. The hapless kid( all us drivers are young) was fired on the spot and Lance made him pay for the product, not only the stuff he was caught handing out but all the stuff Lance said he did n't see him handing out. <p> " But I do n't have it, " the kid protested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you. " Lance leaned casually against the truck that had been the kid 's. He was an ugly, sweaty, utterly relaxed giant who knew just what he wanted from life. This alone, the certainty Lance carried around, intimidated me more than all his exposed bulk. <p> " I mean I do n't have it, period. " The kid seemed a little cocky, which concerned me. <p> Lance spat on the cream-stained ground. " What 'd you make last month? " <p> " How should I know? " <p> " Can you believe this guy? " Lance said to me. <p> The kid stiffened with defiance or maybe fear. <p> " Should I look in the books? " Lance stood full upright, as if to go get the books, but by the stricken look on the kid 's face I knew he expected something else. It was just the three of us in the dim dirt behind the distribution center, really just a shed on the county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you rolled up the bay door. <p> " A hundred forty-three, " the kid said quickly. <p> " You sure it was n't a hundred forty fuckin ' four? " Lance said matter-of-factly. <p> " Why do n't you give him a break? " I said. <p> " Yeah, why do n't you give me a break? " <p> " Yeah, sure, " Lance said with exaggerated sympathy, and picked the kid up by his fleshy chin. He did this with one hand, which impressed me because he was a kid who looked like he really had been eating up the profits. " What 's half of a hundred forty-three? " Lance asked like a giant tutor, still holding him against the truck for what must have been a couple of minutes. It took that long for the kid to come up with an answer and choke it out. Lance put him down and told him, " That 's how much I want by tomorrow. " <p> Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but after this display I was more in awe of my boss than ever. Only part of this was fear. Decisive, self-assured, macho types have always attracted me, though I could n't have told you why. I just knew I liked whatever seemed normal. In that department Lance seemed beyond reproach. Of course he got the money -- it 's how things are around here. In this part of the state, a backwater really, people get roughed up all the time and everybody including the police just minds their own business. As a matter of fact Lance 's brother is one of the five cops in town, but that 's another story. <p> This story stays closer to home, if home is the right word ; in any event the word has all the wrong associations. But getting back to my father : when he brought his two new friends by he was showing his true colors, though I did n't realize it at the time. I saw instead the colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his deceptive charm. At least Mario keeps his eclectic tastes more or less private, otherwise the town would talk, though not as much as you might think ; peculiar is normal around here and I know a few families almost as strange as ours. Almost but not quite. Until recently I really did feel like a freak among freaks, and I was more self-conscious about it than ever. <p> When I was a kid this was of course the only thing I knew, what I came home to every day. Back then we all sat down to dinner. I had friends over. I cut the lawn. Something was bothering me though -- it must have been what spurred me to work hard in school and go on to college, breaking a family tradition. The college kids were n't exactly snobby, they were just natural about their privilege. They affected a rich effortless normalcy that I could n't stand and wished I had too. So coming home was a relief but also depressing. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and not in the direction of conventionality. It got so I ached from the strangeness of it all, especially alone. Other young men lay in bed at night and felt the rush of possibility, were in love or desperate for it, they dreamed of big futures and held their potency in their hands like some inexhaustible elixir. I lay in my garage and felt ashamed. <p> Mario likes to say I have no ambition. In fact it 's become something of a hobby with him. <p> " If I had your brains, Kim, what do you think I 'd be doing? " he asked me. <p> " Probably the same things you do so much of now. " " Well you 're right there. But I would n't be broke and living with my ex. " <p> " I think you 'd find a way to be broke. " <p> " You know me too well. " <p> " That 's just what I 've been thinking lately. " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do very well. " <p> " You mean go to law school and make six figures. " <p> " Is it a crime to show a little ambition? " <p> Like he should talk. His customers leave messages about odd jobs and I find the notes crumpled in the trash. <p> " Dad, money is the wrong reason to go into law. " <p> " Tell that to the lawyers. " <p> " Well it 's not something I think I 'd love. " <p> " You love being the ice cream man? " <p> He had a point there. " I get a good feeling when I make someone happy. " It sounded sappy but was more or less the truth. <p> " That you get from your mother. Look, lawyers can be do -- gooders. They just get paid well for it. " <p> I did n't mention that I 'd known some decent, principled guys at school who were already on their way, already living comfortably. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life, " I cried. <p> " Is that so hard to understand? " I tried to sound zealous. I convinced nobody. <p> My father has a beguiling way of letting you have the last word. He manages with a twinkle and a resigned smile to leave the argument without a trace of bitterness. You think you have the upper hand until later, when the man 's amiable persistence catches up with you. He 's an attractive guy in some ways, and I was still trying to understand how I felt about him. <p> Sophie on the other hand has no guile. With her everything hangs out. She 's a short fleshy woman, in appearance more the elderly parent of the two( although they 're close in age), yet energetically going about her day, wringing her hands at the sad state of the household and the world. Her work may have something to do with this. My mother is a pornographer. More exactly, she 's a long-time employee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out one of the hard core magazines and Sophie is a sort of Girl Friday around the office. She answers the phones and recruits the models and schedules the photo shoots. She knows where to go around here for a quick silicone job. It 's a business, and she 's one of the main reasons they 're profitable. They like her efficiency and the touch of respectability she adds, a kind of matronly counterweight to the sleaze. Also the girls feel comfortable around her, unthreatened and mothered. <p> Sometimes she has them over and they 're a pretty interesting bunch. They all know exactly what they want. They want to get into acting. When one of the new ones panics and wants out, Sophie finds a way to misplace her contract. Occasionally she 'll mix in a little religion and talk to the girls about Jesus, and every so often one of them turns out to be on good terms with the Lord. " God gave me this body and I sure ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard one of them say, to which my mother answered, " Amen to that, child. " I think the chance to do some good in a bleak situation helps explain what a God-fearing woman is doing in this line of work. <p> Naturally Mario ogles the models, but Sophie is very protective and wo n't let him get near them. A devil in gentlemen 's clothing, she calls him. <p> Sometimes I think about God when I 'm out in the truck. You would n't call me a believer exactly, but I 'm not quite an atheist either. I think God is an interesting hypothesis and a handy place to put the blame for things you ca n't explain any other way. Like the girl who always stands out on Providence Street near the housing projects. You look at her and wonder : how on earth could He screw up so bad? She 's one of these kids with a bunch of problems, any one of which would be devastating by itself. One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's balding from the forehead back, which makes her head look oversized -- and then there 's the cleft lip. There are other things about the way she moves, the way she talks. She seems to be friendless. I found out her name is Tara. When Tara 's got money she buys a strawberry parfait and eats it with difficulty, yet delicately, relishing her treat even more than the other kids. I really pile the sauce on, her favorite part -- Lance and his rules be damned. I want to talk to this unfortunate child, but I do n't dare ; nearby is an unsmiling woman I assume is the mother, who thinks God-knows-what about the strange man in the ice cream truck. God knows indeed. But let 's be honest : the un -- smiling mother is only an excuse to not get involved. This girl is strange, and I get enough of that every day as it is. <p> Yet some sort of shift is going on. Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there, a bigger one than usual because of the heat. Someone had opened a hydrant and a lot of the kids were in bathing suits. They were coming up with money left and right, the product was moving and my change drawer was filling up. I get a small percentage -- Lance 's way of motivating us to make him rich -- but I was n't thinking much about this. I was on the lookout for Tara. Her big cockeyed face is easy to spot but at first I did n't see her. Still I held back enough strawberry topping for a parfait in case she showed up. I had to pull the steel lids off the freezers and refill twice from the big five-gallon jug of vanilla base. Everything was running down. From a profit point of view it was an excellent day and I stayed parked under the same tree for what seemed like hours. <p> Eventually the crowd thinned out and there, sitting on the curb a little ways down the block, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I waved, and Tara smiled back after her fashion -- a lovely twisted smile that broke my heart, partly because I knew she had no money today. Well, I looked around, as if Lance had spies in the bushes ; and I looked at the overflowing change drawer ; and I reasoned that we 'd all done well enough today that a little bit of the product would n't be missed. Without hesitating I made up the most elaborate parfait I could, a real frilly job that looked as good as the pictures, and held it out so she could see it. But Tara shook her head no. She must have thought she was expected to pay for it. So, full of warm feeling and without thinking, I yelled out " Free! " <p> As a philanthropist I 'm still an amateur. I knew Tara heard, because kids further down the block came running or careening over on skateboards, and immediately I had a small group at the window, all looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bolder ones cried, " Hey, did the man say, like, free ice cream? " and a few others picked up the chant, and then the crowd really started to get big. Suddenly I was afraid. One sundae might not be missed but these hungry urchins would empty out the truck. <p> I did what any sane ice cream vendor would do in the face of a mob. I retreated to the cab and raced the motor, and when that did n't clear a path I jangled the bells. Eventually, to break free, I had to inch the truck forward into the children, who parted reluctantly, shouting in mock anger( or real anger) and banging the sides so the vehicle rocked. Driving off I glimpsed Tara, limping slowly away from the crowd. Later I cleaned up the strawberry parfait, which in the commotion had fallen from the ledge and looked like a bloody mess on the floor. It made me think of my boss, how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that dim day behind the distribution shed. <p> When it comes to violence of any sort my imagination gets away from me. I think the worst, and as far as I 'm concerned I 've good reason to do it. Every town full of bullies is also a town full of victims, and I was in this second group more often than not in the schoolyard. My father used to tell me what fathers tend to tell their kids : getting knocked around a little is the way you learn how to take care of yourself. Well, it is n't true. I learned how to cower, I learned how to take the long way home, I learned how to get myself in the good graces of people like Lance. Now that I 'm all grown up I 'm just more professional about it. <p> After my unnerving escape from the ice cream mob I needed someone to talk to. <p> " Now, now, " consoled my father when I 'd sobbed out my troubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears. This was probably why I went to him and not my lugubrious mother. <p> " He 's got to know, " I said. " There must have been fifty kids who saw me. <p> " He 's a big fellow, you say? " <p> " Let 's just say he 's about three of me. " <p> " And you think he plays rough? " <p> " I know he plays rough. " <p> Mario perked up. " Muscular? " <p> " He lifts all kinds of weights. " <p> He looked thoughtfully at the hot water heater. <p> " The problem is, son, " my father told me gently, " you never learned how to take care of yourself. " <p> " That 's a big help. " <p> " Besides, it 's my experience that the left hand does n't know what the right does in this town. And even if this fellow goes snooping around, you might be surprised to find out you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? " <p> Well, Lance in fact said nothing about it, and after a while I calmed down. I held out the hope my father would check up on me anyway ; I guess you never really outgrow the need, no matter how unlikely your parents might be as protectors. Of course he just went about his affairs, which really did n't surprise me. I was beginning to understand this man and his sympathies, his needs. <p> Not long after this Sophie and I were in the kitchen. Mario was n't around ; he seldom was when my mother and I were together. <p> " I was talking to Father Lansing about you, " Sophie said. <p> " Again? I ca n't imagine why a man I 've never met has taken such an interest in me. " <p> " It 's his job. He 's interested in all the families in his congregation. " <p> " We 're not in his congregation. You are. And we 're not exactly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Go on, " she cried. " Hurt your mama. Take those college smarts I slaved for and hit me right between the eyes. " <p> What she said was true of course : it was mostly her sacrifice that put me in a position of logical superiority. And the fiction of our family had always been important to her. I considered apologizing. Instead I demanded, " What did Father Lansing have to say about me? " <p> " That you 're a good person in need of a vocation. " <p> " That sounds vaguely religious. " <p> " Like that would do you some harm? But no, he meant work, plain and simple. " <p> " Other than selling ice cream, I assume? " This was getting to be a familiar refrain around here. <p> " The Father said there are plenty of fine careers in social work. And he 'd like to talk to you about them. " <p> " You mean you want me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. No one wants to convert you. "( I did n't believe this but I let her go on.) " Father 's trying to help. He feels as if he knows you and said he might have some suggestions. You can talk on the phone. " <p> " Is he trying to help me or trying to help you? " <p> " Kimmy, you were always a good boy and still are, underneath the smart-aleck. " <p> I smiled and so did she. We both knew we 'd reached the meaningful point in the conversation -- a place, I 'm afraid to say, we seldom got to. <p> Then my mother spoke with uncharacteristic grace. " It 's not so often we can follow our heart and do the right thing at the same time. " She looked sadly in the direction of the cellar door, as if the man who lived down there was the reason for this. " Do n't you think I know my life is n't pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of family? But that does n't stop me from being your mother and worrying about you until I 'm sick. It never has. You want a bit of advice from an old lady? " <p> Sophie in her billowing house dress, with the sticky gray hair and double chin, was n't an attractive sight. Visually it 's much easier talking to Mario. All those years of light work and lounging in the Arizona sun has left him in terrific shape. With my mother the years show : all the hard labor, the sacrifices, indignities I could hardly imagine. <p> I said patronizingly, " Yes, Mama, I want some advice. " <p> " You ca n't change the world, Kimmy, so do n't try. But you can change a bit of it. One little piece at a time. That 's what keeps me going. " <p> " That 's terrific advice, Mama. " <p> " Now will you talk to Father Lansing? " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I got up suddenly, to end the conversation. " I 'll talk to the priest, sure. The next time I need salvation. " <p> My mother sighed heavily and said under her breath, " Jesus sweet Jesus. " <p> As for thinking I can change the world, I suppose I 'm at the right age for this delusion. Lord knows the world needs it. I decided to start right here in our corner of it -- as soon as I thought it would make a difference. <p> I did n't call the priest, not yet. But I thought long and hard, lying in the garage, about my parents and the sad strange relationship they had. When I was around the house I always saw them separately ; I believe they were each afraid of finding out I favored the other. They both cared for me, I have no doubt of that ; and both counted on me, in different ways, to show them the way out of here-the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, when I thought about it, did n't seem unreasonable. The only catch was receiving it from her -- unlike Mario, there was no charm in the delivery. Alone, I could get beyond appearances and see the sense and love in what she said. <p> My father, meanwhile, was still nagging me agreeably about law school. It was n't hard to see the pattern or figure out why he kept at it, once I knew where to look. There too it was necessary to go beyond appearances. <p> Where it really starts to come home to me is in the truck -- where else? -- on another meltingly hot day. I drive along Providence past copycat bungalows : torn screens, paint blistered by the sun, porches sagging under disemboweled washing machines, filthy mattresses, broken baby carriages. Car parts rust in the weedy backyards. Every other street in our forsaken town looks like this. At least these people have a house, I think as I pull up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are running over. <p> " Hey, it 's Mr. Free Ice Cream! " someone cries. <p> I know the boy, a playful mischievous kid. I give him a serious look. " What 's your name? " <p> " Manuel, " he says, hesitating. In spite of the swagger there 's a fear of authority. <p> Tara is off aways, sitting alone as usual on the stoop. It 's interesting that as cruel as these kids sometimes get I 've never seen anyone make fun of her. There seems to be an understanding that her problems put her outside the realm of fair play. <p> " Do me a favor, will you Manuel? " I say to the boy. <p> With my ice cream man 's expertise I quickly make up a parfait, piling on the strawberry sauce. I pass it across the ledge into Manuel 's greedy hands. <p> " Do n't eat it! " I feel strangely empowered, purposeful. <p> " Oh man! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by herself? " <p> " You mean the wicked ugly one? " he says, for clarification. <p> " Yeah. That beautiful girl. " I realize this description is n't as odd as it sounds. " Take it to her, " I command. <p> " Me? " <p> " Do as I tell you. And then come back and I 'll give you something. " <p> There is already a buzz in the air as he delivers the dish. Tara 's mother is nearby and looks at me first in suspicion, then in comprehension, and finally something I have n't seen before : a smile. Tara, picking up on this, takes the parfait and begins to eat in her delicate impaired way. <p> By the time Manuel comes back I 've put together a caramel float for him, his usual. He accepts it wordlessly. The crowd is starting to form and after a little jostling organizes itself into a long line. I take the orders and turn them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh in the heat. Just the way Lance taught me. No money changes hands and none is spoken of. Self -- appointed couriers run into the projects to spread the word and children and adults spill out, joining the line. There is a conspiratorial air, a respectful near-silence. I feel I can count on them to keep this among themselves. <p> " Hey Manuel, " I call. " You done with your float? " <p> " Yeah, man. " He trots over. He strikes me as a clever and energetic kid. <p> " Put this on. " I toss an apron through the big window. <p> He catches it and holds it high. A couple of people clap and hoot. <p> " Whatever you say, boss! " Manuel is n't hiding his excitement. As before he does what I ask, and I open the back door for him and he leaps up. <p> He 's a quick learner. With Manuel 's help we serve almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost exactly right. There is a little chocolate left and a few of the less popular toppings, and that 's it. The truck is empty. It 's been the biggest volume day ever, and owing to the heat probably would have been even with paying customers. Before I send Manuel home I make him a cone with what 's left, and drive the lightened truck away without a worry. <p> Father Lansing turned out to be smart and sly and good -- natured. In other words nothing like what I 'd imagined. I was so comfortable after we talked on the phone that I visited the parish house and we ended up having dinner. He told me about some graduate programs in social work and offered to write a recommendation. And I might just take him up on it ; between Father Lansing and my alma mater getting in would be a cinch. The talk turned theological and in the beginning he declined to accept my agnosticism ; he was a priest, after all. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confessed to wondering occasionally if my position was a defensible one. " We leave the proselytizing to people like your mother, " he said, and we both laughed. There were a few more harmless jokes at Sophie 's expense before I realized I was looking forward to telling her about the evening( except for the brandy and a few other omissions). <p> Right now I 'm looking for a job. Before I go off to school again I want some experience, and around here there 's no shortage of opportunities in the field. The stint on the ice cream truck ended when I explained to the boss how the refrigeration system lost power and all the product had to be flushed down the sewer. Mario refused to crawl under the truck for me and sabotage the proper cable, but he did tell me what to do, after a worried look up and down the street. Lance was suspicious because all the toppings were run down so much, or maybe he heard something about what happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many friends over there. He puffed himself up a bit but in the end did nothing more than give me the opportunity to change careers. To the satisfaction, I might add, of both my parents. <p> I caught the two of them the other day doing something surprising, although they may have been at it in secret for years. I found them in the kitchen together having coffee. If I 'm not mistaken my father was wiping away tears ; beneath the careless charm he 's as vulnerable as the rest of us. The surprising thing is he goes to Sophie when he 's down. Afterwards she said to me, " He 's the devil, that man is, " and continued ironing one of his gaudy floral shirts -- taking special care around the pockets and collar. <p> Recently I met a young woman and we 've been getting along quite well. So well I 'm thinking of moving out of the garage and into her apartment. She 's one of Sophie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now she 's studying to be a speech therapist. Of course she still looks suited for her old job, but is really very domestic and wants lots of kids. I tell her we need to take it one step at time, and the first step is excitement enough for now. <p> Mario is naturally very interested in her and hovers about, coy and shameless. I 'm glad -- it 's helped me get who he really is. If he did persuade me to go out and make a serious salary he 'd find a way to get a portion devoted to his upkeep ; someone has to pay for his indulgences, and even he knows Sophie is n't going to go on doing it forever. Oddly things are better between us -- I mean between all of us -- because I understand what 's been eating at me. My father ca n't hide his selfishness behind our strange family life any more, and I 'm done hiding from it. I think we 're all happier, except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of confidence man of lechery. We enjoy talking about him in bed, Phil and I. <p> Did I mention? My new girlfriend has a boy 's name. We make a strange-sounding couple and that 's just fine with me. <p> I took Phil to the projects, where I 've been spending a fair amount of time. For now it 's my little piece of the world. I was pleased when she hit it off immediately with Tara. The mother thinks well of me ever since that hot day and this opens up a lot of options. Her daughter speaks slowly and with some impediment, but if you 're patient and really listen she 's a smart kid. Phil thinks she can help her, which seems a bit ambitious considering she has n't finished her first speech class. The mother is fine with it though, and it will give us all a chance to know each other better. After a while with Tara the odd organization of the parts of her face no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite ordinary, shy still but underneath a soulful child. <p> Author Affiliation
