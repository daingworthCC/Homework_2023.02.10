1006141 Nan 's brother called that morning before she was fully awake. " Nan, bad news. Your old farmer is dead. " <p> " Not Woody! " Benny told her that, yes, Woody 's housekeeper had found his body lying across the bed. His preacher had called trying to find someone to conduct the funeral. <p> " Is his preacher no longer burying his own board members? " <p> " He 's taking off to New Orleans to visit his wife 's folks. " <p> " I just ca n't believe Woody 's dead. He and I talked on the phone Saturday. Do you know whether he had any blood relatives? " <p> " A nephew. He may not show. " <p> " Do you think I should try to get a plane? " But Benny said, " No, Nan. You know how people love to talk. " She could send flowers, anyway. She got out the thin Allabeena phone book. Any kind would do since Woody could n't know. She saw him in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cry over him. But he would n't approve of spending money on funeral flowers, even for himself-especially for himself! She smiled, thinking of how he counted his pennies. She could see his slender body standing at the counter to order the flowers. He might decide they were too much, thank the girl and turn and leave, pleased over what he had saved. But Woody was n't buying these flowers, and she would spend whatever she liked. <p> Nan had left Mississippi years before, but she kept the florists ' numbers handy for the various funerals. She ordered a spring wreath. Woody firmly believed that his soul would live forever, so maybe if he smelled the irises it would rise up from his casket and say, " Time to plant sugarcane. " <p> Nan walked into the mail room that morning where four of her colleagues were standing around drinking coffee, whining about their upcoming classes. When she told them that Woody was dead, one said, " Well, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old farmer that courted her? Now see, Nan? You should have been nicer to Woody. " She wished she had n't mentioned it. <p> " Nan could have rested easy in a rocking chair on his porch from here on out. <p> They each had a clever one-liner, as if she were n't even in the room, like in a Chekhov play. Woody, dead in Allabeena, had lived out his life oblivious of such frivolous, phoney games. Nan was still amazed that, years ago, she had actually married a sparkling talker like these, but she had quickly tired of him. Finally, " What 's going to happen to that money of Woody 's? " <p> She told them he had probably left it to his church. She then slipped out the door and escaped to her office. Woody 's effort to court her had been a great joke to them. Not one would have guessed that she had dreamed now and then about the peace of Woody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cab of his tractor, putting in a tape and bumping along to the rhythm of " Gaite Parisienne " alive with her own exhilarating passion. As she gathered up the books for her sophomores, she saw them in their seats, their muscles bulging with youth, their untamed minds ready to work on the poetry she loved. As for Woody, he had spent his days cutting hay and birthing calves. <p> The rumor about the trial began to spread six months after Woody 's death. Benny called as soon as he heard it. <p> " Nan? Just wanted to tell you. Woodrow 's nephew is contesting the will. Did I wake you? Nan? " <p> " What are you talking about, Benny? I 'm eating breakfast. " <p> " Woody 's will. His nephew 's saying Woody was incompetent. " <p> " You 're kidding. " <p> " Somebody said your name has been mentioned. " <p> " My name? Impossible. " <p> " Just thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wait a minute, Benny. Did you go to the doctor? " <p> " Yeah, I 'm okay. He wants to do a couple more tests. " <p> Woody incompetent! Oh God, they 'll turn it over to a jury of Allabeena Countians-a jury for a smart lawyer to manipulate. <p> As she ate her muffin, she glanced at the syllabus for her first class. " The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock " for today. Good, she could teach it with her eyes closed. Like Prufrock, Nan had begun to wear her trousers rolled. That fiftieth milestone coming up would n't be a celebration, though she still " heard the mermaids singing, each to each. " Poor Woody had never known about the mermaids. But he was far from incompetent. What kind of scandal were they concocting in Allabeena County? <p> From the beginning, any relationship at all between her and Woody had been unlikely. They had met at a funeral, one of those thinly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Irish wake. Nan admitted that she always got caught up in them. The rituals were wonderfully overblown, with people reveling in their grief. It was during " the viewing " of her cousin that Woody must have spotted her. There, the casket framed by banks of flowers and the family standing in a receiving line for hours upon hours, neighbors and friends came for the " last respects. " After hugging almost wantonly, the friend and a family member stepped to the casket. Their arms still encircling, they put the tissues to their noses and reached a hand to touch the cold skin of the departed. Often they clung together in another long, tearful embrace while visitors watched, whispering, the scent of flowers almost bringing on a swoon. <p> Or perhaps she and Woody had met in the hallway where people talked and exclaimed happily as they resurrected an old family connection. The halls were always crowded with people reminiscing, laughing boisterously. They recalled ridiculous events, often passing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the steamy, glad atmosphere, Woody probably had spoken a few conventional words to Nan and she had put her arm around this older man, another face in the crowd. <p> His first call came one night when Nan was deep into her old TV movie. Her fingers reached for the remote. <p> " Nan? This is Woodrow Godwin. " <p> " Pardon? " Who was this, breaking into her evening cocoon? <p> " Woodrow Godwin.... I met you at your cousin 's funeral. " <p> " Oh. Sorry, I do n't believe I remember you. " <p> " Woody Godwin, from out at Red Bank. You spoke to me at the funeral home.... From Red Bank. I knew your older brothers real well, been knowing your family for years. I was married to Beulah Jordan. You remember the Jordan family. " <p> She began to search for the Jordans in that green world of her childhood. Yes, at the summer camp meeting where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repent. A faceless young woman in a thin flowing dress, her palmetto fan stirring the heat-this farmer had courted and married her. He might well use that name to introduce himself, for the Jordans were highly respected property owners at Allabeena. " Yes, I remember the Jordons. " <p> " I said you would. I said I aimed to call and see when was you coming back down here. " <p> " Oh? " <p> " Tonight I says, this is when I 'm gon na do it. You know my wife died last winter. <p> " Did she? I 'm sorry. " <p> " When you coming? " <p> " Oh, I do n't know. " <p> " Well, I 'll call you again sometime. " Was he hanging up? " Yeah, I 'll call you again next week. " <p> He was gone. Had she offended him? Well, what did he expect, coming out of some misty nowhere? After about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonged to an era when one did not chat on long distance for an hour about nothing. As if watching the clock, he gave himself seven to eight minutes. Nan knew Red Bank, Woody 's remote, crossroads location. She had traveled the country highway, a lovely little winding road, usually at dusk, her shortcut between major highways during those tense years of graduate school-the rolling land, the lonely peace, so soothingly desolate. <p> Woody was obviously looking for someone to join him there, and Nan might seem a good candidate, coming as she did from a family that had produced preachers. Being much younger also helped, and she had no children. In his innocence, Woody would assume he had done his homework. After all, women were simple, agreeable creatures-just there, like the ether of his world. <p> This first phone call began a twice-a-week ritual-Wednesday and Saturday nights. His news? His calf was " down sick, " and he debated whether he should spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trap for ' coons and caught a big rat instead. " I just throwed him in that old well up there, " laughing-the events of his days. A lonely old guy, with his details about another life. Always a short call, and Nan, fed up with what passed for humor among her colleagues, glimpsed this remote world and found it refreshing. Of course she knew she filled the role of his lost Beulah as he rattled on, giving Nan no opening to reply. To her, it was like reading a novel that required no response. <p> What he had to say was not the predictable talk she heard at work. He had sent a five-dollar contribution to a small press that mailed out lists of companies engaged in " immoral practices, " such as advertising with near-nude figures, companies to be boycotted. He mentioned a loan he had made, fifty thousand dollars to a religious college at 6 percent. Was he trying to impress her? No, she soon saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about letting even a religious institution get control of his money. He told about the constant-care facility where Beulah had died. It had cost one-hundred-thirty dollars per week for that last ten weeks, " and five dollars for laundry, besides, " he added, with some emphasis. Now and then he referred to the fact that he had grown up in Allabeena County during the Depression. <p> Woody did not court her. He did not appear to know how. But then he began to talk about the nearby junior college. She could marry him, live with him, and listen while he talked, and, if she cared to " teach college, " fine! He did n't need to say it. After all, why would he spend money on these calls? Nan could not help being amused as he rambled on. That such innocence could exist in this mad world! A man so open, so oblivious to the game of manipulation! Imagine : If she liked him, she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. But Nan realized that she needed to do something about these phone calls. Woody had not asked for anything, but.... Still, how could she do it-a man so artless? It would be like swatting a nice little green skink. Besides, he never stopped talking long enough! But of course this was the game of love, whether he knew it or not. Now and then she asked herself how it would be to love someone who had not been all scarred up by distrust, a sweet old guy like Woody. <p> But she would tell him. She must and she would. First, there were the years that separated them, twenty-five of them. And what about her " encounters of the rare kind, " as she called them, at professional meetings or on trips to London for a week of theater? Woody wanted a warm body in his house, whereas Nan preferred one in her bed! The fact was that Woody had n't any inkling about her world. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by, someone nearer his own age. Nan would have to tell him, whether he proposed or not. <p> Woody took her to lunch at the best cafeteria in Allabeena. He arrived at Benny 's in his pickup truck. She could hardly believe, when she saw him coming up the walk, how good he looked. He could n't be seventy-five! Thin, straight, broad-shouldered and narrow-hipped-moving almost like a young man. Now, wait a minute, Nan! Do not even think.... Still, what did she know about men that age? He was bald, but little wisps of bright yellow curls grew scattered over the top and along the sides. It was his smile, though, more than anything, as if he were up to something. How Beulah must have loved him at twenty-one! Here he came with a button off his shirt sleeve, as if he had studied the chapter on " how to get Nan to take you in. " When he bowed his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the urge to take that old bald head and hold it to her. But Nan was a sensible woman. They rode around the county seat in his pickup. He showed her the park where he and his old CCC camp buddies had a reunion every summer. He took her by his church. " There 's the van sitting there.When the preacher decided to buy it, one board member walked out. I did n't, though. " But he had disapproved. <p> As they stopped in front of Benny 's house, she made her speech. " Woody, I appreciate all the attention you have paid me, but I think I ought to tell you that I can never give up my independence. I 'm glad to be friends with you, but we can never be anything more than friends. " He did n't say anything, did n't say he was disappointed, did n't try to rescue his pride. After a minute, he smiled and squeezed her hand. <p> At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " She took his picture, his legs spread a little, smiling that young, rakish smile of his, and then he took hers. <p> " I hope you find a nice woman, Woody. " <p> " I was n't looking at anybody but you. " She glanced up at his eyes and melted all over. He put his arm around her, that devilish grin on his face, and pulled her to him. <p> She watched him walk to his pickup and get in. She closed the door and stood in the empty living room, listening to his truck move away. The breaking off had gone well, and that was good. But she felt terribly alone and admitted that she almost wanted to cry. Then she noticed Woody 's cap lying on the chair, a bright green baseball cap. She picked it up and held it against her face. <p> Before ten days had gone by Woody called. Then in two more weeks he called again. He never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would remind herself to tell him not to call. But he never said anything that could be construed as pressing his case and, as usual, gave her no opening. When the photos were developed, she stuck the two of them into an envelope and wrote a short note repeating what she had already said : " Woody, I appreciate your phone calls, but.... " In his next call, he said he had received the pictures and that " they came out good. " <p> Gradually she noticed a subtle difference in these calls. He still did n't ask any questions, but he would wait sometimes, as if to give her a chance to respond. He said he could n't find his hearing aid, and she suggested he check with the dealer, that it might be insured. He told her his dog slept by his bed and waited for her to say hers did too. He sent clippings about a retirement complex that had opened and slipped in a picture of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book by a preacher, which he asked her to return, and she flipped through it and saw that he had underlined two paragraphs about " being committed to something. " Was this small revelation about his religion a large one to him? He had driven up to State College to a baseball game, but he had not seen his nephew. Clearly he had hoped he would and felt more alone that night, and she tried to talk in gentler tones. Once he told her that he had visited the old cemetery, though he did n't say it was where Beulah was buried. Nan asked, hesitantly, " Beulah 's grave? " and somehow she knew he had wanted his wife 's name to be spoken. <p> But it did n't occur to Nan that Woody had begun realizing that time was running out for him. When he told her that, if he did marry, the woman would draw six-hundred dollars a month for life from Atlantic Mutual, she knew he had mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste. What she did n't see was that, to him, not finding a wife and thus covering this loss represented a significant failure to him. He needed her to comfort him for making such an error. Also, although he did n't sound desolate, he told her again that he might have to give up his cows, or maybe he would " just have to go to a rest home. " She should have taken this more seriously instead of brushing it off, even scoffing somewhat. But he seemed so composed and in control ; how could she have known? <p> At last he did say that he was not feeling well, " had a hurting " in his arm and shoulder. She told him that he would probably feel better in a few days and urged him to go to the doctor. Well, he did n't sound sick. But why had " heart attack " not occurred to her? She heard nothing from him for two weeks, and then, on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shoulder were better. She was glad to hear from him. He shared his good news and they chatted longer than the usual few minutes. <p> And then, five days later, Woody was dead. <p> A kind of malaise came over Nan that fall which, she told herself, resulted from her frequent attacks of hay fever. Although she enjoyed her classes, she had no energy when she got home. When Benny told her in early December that he was n't feeling well, she decided to spend Christmas with him. After Benny 's boys and their families had come and gone, Benny and Nan sat on his warm sunny deck, and he told her about the court trial contesting Woody 's will. People were upset about it, Benny said ; " Everybody liked Woody. " <p> " Has the church tried to compromise with the young man? He may spend what Woody left him and get nothing. " <p> " They ca n't settle out of court. Down here it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumors are going around. They say the church might lose. " <p> " Do you know how much money Woody left? " <p> " They say it 's something over two-hundred thousand. " <p> " All of it put together penny by penny. He said one time that Beulah was a better manager than he was. It hardly seems fair, as hard as they tried, that it did n't amount to more. What are they saying about how I fit into the picture? " <p> " That the woman from North Carolina influenced Woody. " <p> " The woman from North Carolina, huh? " <p> " Yeah. It 's Luke Shatlow, you know, from Jackson. " <p> " The lawyer that got so much notoriety from that gambling boat case? What 's he doing taking this little backwoods case? " <p> " Well, Luke 's getting old. He was never too particular what kind he argued, you know. He thinks he wo n't have to put any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Shatlow 's found people who developed petty hatreds through the years. He 's good with a jury, too. And do n't forget, three-fourths of Allabeena County watches the soap operas lately, even the men, and you still look pretty good, Nan. They do n't care if the nephew never showed him any attention ; blood 's thicker'n water, ' they 'll say. " <p> " Can you find out the name of the lawyer for the defense? " A few days after Nan got home she left a message on Lawyer Griffin 's answering machine. He called on Sunday morning and led her to talk for almost an hour about Woody. He was soft-spoken and likable, but she feared that he was too young to stand up against Shatlow. He seemed to be particularly interested in two exact dates : when did she and Woody meet, and when did she send the letter with the pictures. Although she learned very little about how he expected to proceed, he obviously wanted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She might be able to come if the date coincided with her spring break, she told him. <p> In March, just as Nan was finishing her exams, Benny 's son called. Benny had had a heart attack and was in the hospital. Maybe she should come right on. Nan completed her grades, packed, and drove to Mississippi. She went directly to the hospital and found to her relief that Benny was out of danger. Still, she visited with Benny 's family in the waiting room most of the next day and kept a close watch on Benny 's condition. Finally she called Mr. Griffin late in the day. He had been trying to get her, and in fact he needed her on the stand the very next morning. Nan saw that, this way, she would have no time to question anyone about what had transpired in the trial. <p> Nan dressed rather conservatively that morning in a navy suit that fit her well. She wanted to present the image of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived at the courthouse at ten, met Mr. Griffin and had a few words with him. She was relieved to see that he was somewhat older than he had sounded-mid-forties or more. <p> Mr. Griffin had some preliminary matters, giving Nan barely enough time to scan the courtroom. However, she saw that only two members of the jury were women, one white and one black. She would have to make it with the white males, for neither of these women would argue with the men 's decision. <p> Mr. Griffin asked Nan about her background, specifically her education. Nan listed off her graduate degrees, wondering how he planned to offset the antipathy these men might be feeling toward " the educated woman. " But he appeared to be letting it ride, hoping simply that they would be impressed. Griffin led her to explain her relationship with Woody-his many calls, her announcement that there could be nothing more than friendship between them. " But he continued to call you? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. He reminded me of my older brothers, talking about being a young man during the Depression, about going to the CCC camp, and so forth. " The jury needed a pigeonhole for this relationship, some slot other than the one Shatlow would try to fashion. <p> Nan saw right away that this was not a high-powered courtroom, that the atmosphere was quite informal. Whenever Shatlow objected, she made a point of being good-humored and agreeable. Maybe she could even act cool enough to make him lose patience with her! Anyway, she would concentrate on proving that Woody was a sane man, and, if she got a chance, she would show them that she had been there for Woody when his nephew had not. Finally Griffin asked, " From what you observed, what would you say about Woodrow 's competence? " <p> " Woody certainly was not senile, in my opinion. It never once crossed my mind that he could be considered incompetent. His mind was real sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was running his cattle farm just as he always had. He was n't even forgetful like most people up in years. He remembered things from week to week when we talked on the phone, and I thought he was especially astute in money matters. <p> The lunch break came before Shatlow had a chance to question her, and two of the women of the church introduced themselves and sat with her over their trays of food. It turned out that one of them, a nice-looking older woman, had been courted by Woody a few months after his wife died. Nan learned that Shadow had been trying to show that church members had conspired to get Woody to leave his money to the church. Shatlow had been " right ugly " to the women, accusing them of forever paying compliments to Woody on how he was dressed, etc., trying to get them to admit they had " played up to Woody. " Also, he had accused a couple of preachers of ganging up on Woody, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his own will. Then one of them told Nan about how Shatlow had been portraying her : " The first day of the trial, he called you Woody 's forty-year-old lover! " <p> Nan went to the parking lot and got into her car. She needed thirty minutes to drive around, get calm, and assimilate this information. She should have known Shatlow was just such a scoundrel! Since he had n't expected her to come for the trial, he had simply lied. Nan found herself on the road that led to Woody 's lake-the site of his CCC camp reunion. She parked and sat a minute thinking of what a shock this trial would be to him. <p> Nan went back into the courthouse with her guns loaded. Shatlow began with " Miss Nelson, I understand two of your brothers are preachers, is that right? " She recognized this line of questioning as the " conspiracy " theory. He would involve her, too, in getting gullible old Woody 's money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them was the pastor here a year or two ago? " <p> " No, neither of them pastored here. " Their young nephew had, ten years ago, but she was n't about to volunteer that fact. " Have you ever worked for the church yourself? " <p> " No. " <p> " Not full-time, but part-time. " <p> " No. " <p> " But one of your brothers was at one time a pastor at Woodrow 's church, I believe, and is n't that why you want the money to go to the church? " <p> " No, neither of my brothers was ever there. I want Woody 's money to go to the church because Woody left it there. " <p> " Just answer the question, please. Did you ever discuss Woody 's will with Rev. Andrews or Mr. Wharton? " <p> " No. I do n't believe I 'm acquainted with Mr. Wharton. Mr. Shatlow, I do n't really know these people, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this case until my name was brought into it by someone else. " A titter in the back of the courtroom-the " someone else " was Shatlow of course. He asked the judge to caution her about " extraneous testimony, " but the damage was done. From the corner of her eye, she caught the smile of one of the men on the jury. But she warned herself to be careful. She must not get labeled a smart-ass by these Allabeena men. <p> " Did you discuss the making of his will with Woody? " <p> " No, I did not. It would certainly have been tactless of me to bring up what would happen to his money after he was dead. " <p> " But you did advise him on financial matters? " <p> " No, he did n't need my advice. He did tell me about a large sum of money he loaned to a religious college at 6 percent, which I thought was a good tax-free investment. " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " No, he had made it before I met him. He also told me one time that he had done his income tax and I was impressed with that since I have to have help with mine. " <p> " Judge, would you instruct the witness to stick to the question? " Still, she had got in another plug for Woody. " Miss Nelson, do you expect us to believe that Woodrow 's infatuation with you did n't have any influence on him in making out his will? " <p> " Infatuation is not the word I would use. I think, Mr. Shatlow, he may have considered me appropriate as a possible wife because I had my own pension and no children to want his money, but I never thought he was what you call infatuated. " <p> " I 'm not asking what you thought. Is it not a fact that he was infatuated with you? " <p> " He never said so. " <p> " Then why did you write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and he began to wave around the note she had sent to Woody with the pictures. <p> " Because it seemed only fair that I warn him not to take up his time with me when I was not available. " Nan forced herself to remain calm. What nerve, bringing that note into court, waving it in the air, trying to fabricate a love affair between her and that old farmer. But apparently he too became aware that he might be overplaying his hand, for he laid the note on the table. <p> " When did you first meet Woodrow Godwin, Miss Nelson? " <p> " In August of 1990 at my cousin 's funeral. " <p> " But you had met him at church functions before that, your brothers being preachers, had n't you? " <p> " No. " <p> " Why did you make the trip to Mississippi in March of ' 91? " <p> " To visit my family. " <p> " You saw Woodrow on that occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did this take place? " <p> " We went to lunch. " <p> " To lunch.... You say he called you frequently. Did you refuse any of these phone calls of his? " <p> " No, I did not. It appeared to me that he needed to talk to somebody about what was going on in his life. " <p> " But you claim you never spent much time with him. " " That 's right. " <p> " And yet you were able to come up with all these conclusions about the man 's character based on that little amount of time? " <p> " And on the numerous phone calls. " <p> " Just answer the question, yes or no. " <p> " No, Mr. Shatlow, my conclusions are based on the numerous phone calls as well. " <p> He said something to the judge. Was it over? Mr. Griffin got up and asked her if she knew anything about Woodrow Godwin 's reading habits. <p> " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clippings. " Shatlow was on his feet. " Did you see him reading the newspaper? Somebody else could have clipped those out and sent them, for all you know. " <p> " Yes, of course, Mr. Shatlow. " The man in the corner of the jury box was definitely smiling at this ridiculous proposal. Nan went on, " But also, one time he sent me a book written by some preacher in California. I saw he had underlined something about commitment, about how a man 's life should mean something. I said, Woody wants his life to have meaning and not just die and be forgotten. ' To Woody, his money stood for what he had accomplished in life, and his church was what he really believed in. I was n't surprised at what he did for them. " <p> Mr. Griffin had one more question : " How close to his death was Woodrow 's last call to you? " <p> " It was the Saturday night before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell me he was feeling better than the last time he had called. He wanted to share his good news with me. It showed me that he considered me a friend that would be glad with him. That phone call meant a lot to me. " Now it was over, for better or for worse. <p> But, no, Shatlow was up again. " Miss Nelson, one more question. It looks like the date on this envelope is 1989. This dear-john letter. Did n't you write this letter to Woodrow Godwin in 1989 instead of in 1991? " " I object, " Mr. Griffin said. " I 've looked at that postmark, and I ca n't tell- " Shatlow interrupted. " The facts you 've given do n't fit with some of the other circumstances in this case, Miss Nelson. Could n't the date of this letter be 1989? " <p> " No, it could n't. The date of my cousin 's death is a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1990. " Now it was over. As she left the stand, she suddenly realized what that last question was all about. Shadow was insinuating that she wrote to Woody before his wife died! That an affair had been going on before his wife was even dead! What a filthy idea! The content of the letter itself proved that this could not be true. But he 's taking a chance that the jury wo n't remember what the letter said. He thinks all he has to do is plant the suggestion. It was a last-ditch effort on his part, but what if it worked? <p> One of the women from the lunch break walked her out. " The jury wo n't swallow that lie, " she insisted, but Nan was n't so sure. Shatlow had been successfull with juries for years. <p> Nan took the long way around driving back to the hospital. She needed to cool off before talking to Benny. She felt as if she had been through something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. That nasty lawyer would resort to anything! My God, was nothing sacred anymore? She wished she could believe that Woody had found the heaven he believed in-a place more appropriate for him, where people were honest and trusting. But she was afraid, in this real world, that Woody 's heaven was only a limited illusion, like some poet 's dream. <p> When she got back to the hospital, she found that Benny 's doctor was sending him home tomorrow. His granddaughter would stay with him for a week, and if he would follow his exercise program, he should soon be all right. <p> By nine the next morning Nan was turning into the courthouse parking lot. The verdict might be in. <p> As she got out of her car, she saw the women she had met and two of the preachers standing on the marble steps, smiling and talking animatedly. " Woody, you 've won, " Nan breathed. <p> They greeted Nan with hugs all around and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shatlow 's despicable conduct, they had got a lot of satisfaction out of seeing him get beat. <p> " We just wanted to see Woody 's dignity restored, Nan, " one said. Winning the court battle on Woody 's behalf did help. Nan liked thinking that what Woody stood for could prevail after all. <p> Soon Nan was on her way to North Carolina. As she drove, she thought about all the nights when Woody had called, chatting away about this and that. To begin with, any reasonable person would n't have let herself get so involved with Woody and his concerns. She almost felt angry with herself that she had. She knew from the start that there was too much of a gap between themWoody, a man from the Depression era, and herself, the eager, daring type from a different era, with not enough caution to fortify herself against oncoming pain. The sun warmed Nan 's hands on the steering wheel as she drove north out of Chattanooga where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. She put in her Madame Butterfly disc. Anyway, she thought, what had been inevitable from the start with Woody had now completed itself. So she could forget about Woody Godwin now, she told herself-Woody, with his scattered bright curls on his old bald head and that impish little smile on his face. Suddenly Madame Butterfly began singing her tragic aria, and tears filled Nan 's eyes. But she would have to try to reconcile herself. She would simply have to do it, of course. But in this moment, looking toward those evenings when there would be no eightminute calls, no brief glimpsing of Woody 's world, she felt that she could not. <p>
