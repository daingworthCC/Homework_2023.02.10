1010041 Mr. Simmons was not a family man. <p> This, although he had a family. A wife, two daughters. A large apartment to put them in. A dog. He felt attached to them( fuzzy headed, waving from a distance), as he did to certain household kinks-the sticky lock, the weak showerhead. Comfortable inconveniences, he might say. He preferred the empty office on Sundays to the fussy kitchen at home. He did n't heft a pine up the steps at Christmas, perform science experiments with lightbulbs and tin-foil, romp off to the corner store for snacks. No bike rack on the Toyota, no ski trips, no corn in the city of Chicago community garden. He worked late, told the kids to cut the racket at dinner, read political magazines before bed. He sighed heavily, slammed the refrigerator door when the kids asked for cash or keys. But Mr. Simmons was n't cruel. He never beat his family or tossed them down the stairs. <p> The younger Simmons daughter entered college, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. To his surprise his wife went out and got a teaching certificate and within a year had a classroom of ten-year-olds. Each morning she left earlier than he, left him to rinse his cereal bowl alone. In her absence, he walked through rooms spread out and white, felt the air around him, poked his head into the abandoned bathroom by the kids ' rooms-folded towels, wrapped soap, clean tiles. He thought irritably, " Why do we need such a big apartment? " <p> This was the first thing. Then, new emotions. His wife spoke endlessly on the phone to the girls, left Mr. Simmons to wait his turn to talk, helpless, dying as he stood there, yes, each moment another moment lost. Finger drumming, heavy sighs, wild hand signals to no avail. She finally handed him the phone. He did n't have anything to say. <p> Or when his elder announced she was moving to San Francisco with her husband, he was stunned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? " <p> " He 's an environmental lawyer. " <p> " I 'd like to see him fit a tie around that thick neck, " he said. <p> Minor outbursts like these increased. The family backed off in bewilderment, then ignored him. <p> The day after his daughter moved, he woke, put his feet in his slippers, and went looking for the dog. A bit old now, the pooch. " Here boy, " he called, patted his leg, whistled. The dog limped over. " Treat? Treat? " he said. In the kitchen he fed it a puppy bis-cuit, tossed it the squeaky toy. He waved from the door as he left for work. " Good boy. Sit. " That night he carried the dog into the bedroom. <p> " Thought the old mutt may as well stay with us tonight, " he said. <p> " Wo n't your allergies bother you? " his wife asked, looking over her book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allergies. You know, " she said, " allergies. " <p> Years before he must have lied to keep the dog out of the bedroom. <p> He shooed it into the hall. <p> He knew plenty of women. A proper jacket, one hand pressed to the small of her back, the other lifted to summon a taxi, her dress spinning in a slow circle. But most of the women he knew were his wife 's friends-painted cracked lips, puffed hair. They had stopped talking to him beyond the required niceties years ago. <p> He watched the women at work. They strolled through the hallways with files tucked under their arms, studied the bulletin board in the lunchroom. He pretended to be busy with the coffeemaker. He could n't approach. <p> His younger daughter arrived for a visit. He followed her from room to room, knocked on her door when she shut it. <p> " What do they have you reading at school? " he asked, leaning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, held the dog 's face with both hands and cocked it back and forth. " Nothing you 'd be interested in, " she said. <p> " What makes you think I 'm not interested? " he asked. " I 'm not an interesting enough person to be interested? " he turned on his heel. " I expect a list by suppertime! " <p> Later in bed, he explained the matter to his wife in a diplomatic tone, " It does n't matter what she reads. She has her life, I have mine. As it should be. " <p> " Then do n't make such a fuss next time, " his wife said and snapped off the light. <p> A pivotal moment is imminent, Mr. Simmons thought, marching into the lunchroom. A notice tacked to the board read like a personal message : ILLINOIS PRISONER REFORM ASSOCIATION. An ink drawing of a man in a studious pose over a book. Mr. Simmons leaned closer.
