5004041 # I dreamed you were a spaceship, exploring moons and planets, hyperdriving from galaxy to galaxy with your silver-gray body stretching like filaments of memory across space and time. I dreamed you travelled galaxies and careened through asteroid fields, your sensors laughing and crying with each wild twist and roller-coastery turn. I dreamed you shifted between multi-dimensions as easily as a conversation moves from point to point. # I dreamed you were the spaceship 's engines. # The driving force. # Burning bright with violet light that flared from your rockets, pushing onward, folding space, thrusting, boosting, and powering. # Your energy moved everything. # Dilithium crystals. Star Drive. Turbocharged Quantum Divisors. # You were all of them and more. Compressing the timeline as you raced across space or expanding it, extending it out like a wire pulled thin. # Always forward, though. # That 's the one immutable fact of physics. Time moves on. # I dreamed you travelling, though. # Warp Speed ahead. # Awake now, in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the machine on our counter, I know I could have dreamed the flames pushing out of your rockets to be red or blue or mixed of oranges and yellows. I could have dreamed them to be white hot, or merely a simple invisible pulse. # Violet is your color, though. # " When I am old, I shall wear purple, " I hear you say. # The memory makes me happy in our dark kitchen. # The coffee is hot. I wrap my fingers over the rounded cup, remembering what it felt like to wrap them around parts of your body. Heat travels up my arms. # 1 step outside to our patio and look up at the stars. # Seeing Saturn in the darkness, I imagine I can see rings as I remember dreaming of you as the spaceship 's life support system, too. # When I sit on the padded glider we bought years ago, the metallic pinions squeal their welcome. Its platform holds me up, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me, making me comfortable. # I close my eyes and see your pipes, your ducts, and your filters winding through the spaceship 's skin. Condensation covers some, padding wraps others. The system runs with a low hum as you pump oxygen to the astronauts and as you take out C02. " Too much and everyone 's dead, " you say to me through vi- brations in the scrubbers. " Same with the oxygen. " # Too much 02 is poison. # It 's a balance. # Life support. # I think about that as the star field marches across the sky. # Too much control and you stifle life ; too much neglect and entropy gives way to apathy. # I tried, though. I 'm doing my best. # I dreamed you were the navigation system, complete with maps and star charts, giving the captain directions one step at a time-though you had the whole route burned into your impressive memory banks, you doled them in small bites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once. # We are like that, you know. Men. # Cunning? Yes. And scheming. Sometimes angry. Devious. Selfish. Oblivious. Vengeful. Stupid. Crazy. Bothered. Irked. A man is not bred to be easy to live with. # We can be kind, though. Loving, even. # Soft on the inside. # Sometimes we can even listen. # As the end comes, though, we are simple creatures, mostly driven by fear and the unquenchable need to be accepted, which is just another crappy way to say we want you to think we 're too cool for school. # I dreamed you were the kitchen full of 3-D printers in the spaceship 's mess hall deck, your atomic constructors churning out biscuits and sandwiches, protein bars and succulent fruit. I recalled the smell of the most perfect omelets at dinnertime. # I dreamed you were an astronaut. # The science officer, exploring botany and the physics of building a work desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge account that sent us to Paris and Berlin. A tech, fixing the cooler, cursing as the screwdriver gashed your hand. Then you were EVA, floating in space and holding my hand as we looked over a waterfall. I dreamed we walked a rounded treadmill together, rotating with the ship 's spin. You wore close-cropped gym clothes that showed nothing but revealed all- exercise is the key to a long life, you said, smiling in a way that said you knew I was n't thinking about anything quite so far away. # Men are simple like that, too. # We do n't understand time. # I wake up to find daylight has replaced the dream sky. # The sun, rising over the mountains, has a harsh edge of reality that bums cool now, but that will get more oppressive as the day reveals itself. # My neck is sore from being draped over the wrought iron hardness of the glider 's back. Shoulders ache. Knees cranky. The coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the liquid whose level has been reduced, evaporated into the morning a few molecules at a time, disappearing into nothing so slowly and so silently that you could wonder if they ever existed to begin with. # Alas, you are not a spaceship. # I think of the dream, though. # I think of dreaming. # I stare at the mountains to help build the layers of effort it will take to smile, and joke, and speak the same words over and over again, to not be hurt that sixty years were n't enough for you to remember me. # The hallways I dread so much come over me. # The open rooms full of other people who are not spaceships or life support systems, or astronauts. The smell of uneaten food. The sound of piped-in music. Bracelets wrapped around ankles. # Let me be strong, I think, as I stare at the mountaintop ringed by that most pure dome of blue sky. # I swallow and feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth. # Across the backyard, a bird pecks at the tree where we once kept seed. # No, I think as I stand up to shave and to put on the shirt and pants that I know you like the most. # You are not a spaceship. # If you were a spaceship, you would be derelict now, hulls vented to space, command centers vacant, computers dead or dying with their electrons racing sporadically across soldered traces too moldy to hold their charge, or sending information on waves too broken to be intercepted. # If you were a spaceship, you would be alone. # Orbiting a singularity too dark to see. # And that, my love, will never happen
