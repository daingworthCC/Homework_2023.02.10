5004241 # " The Gates of Paradise " follows-by many generations-the short story " Paradise Regained "( January/February 2017). # My thoughts wander as the countdown sits mired in yet another hold. To be mindful of time 's passage is to be helplessly aware that if the technical issues are not quickly resolved, if this launch does not take place soon, it need not happen at all. # Voices rise and fall, droning in my headset. To keep me informed, they say. As if it matters. As if the delays have had anything to do with anything over which this capsule offers its occupant control. Should the occasion ever arise that my paying attention does matter, I trust I will hear some difference. Mission Control has only to call out, if not my name, then that of this capsule. # Reunion One. # To resist the pessimistic drift of my thoughts, I take recourse to my own antiquarian mindset. To why I am here in the first place.. # By how many measures can this day 's stillnascent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? The distance-if distance is -teriy what a mile measured-was lost long ago. Yet of this I am certain : a milestone denotes something significant. # And what is a calendar anyway but the ongoing commemoration of some milestone? Our current era dates-as best we can reconstruct it-from the still mysterious release of the Cure. Oh, it is sheer pretense that anyone knows to a generation, much less to a precise day, when the Cure began. But its release, without a doubt, did happen. The evidence is unequivocal, recorded in genetic differences between our remote, tm-Cured ancestors and ourselves. #( Genetics : a newborn marvel of our age. And as with any newborn, we invest our hopes and dreams in its perceived potential. Genetics offers i&uuml;st the beginning of a hint of an understanding of the cellular mechanism by which reproduction can happen. As for how a certain miraculous molecule, with its two entangled coils, encodes genes? As for what any particular gene does? No one knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the rocket on which I wait impatiently, trying not to imagine the explosive potential of so much fuel and oxidant. Some eventualities are best not dwelt upon....) # Today, I hope most sincerely, will someday mark Day One of a new calendar. Of a new era : the age of spaceflight. Perhaps, even, in some small sense, the beginning of the end of our long diaspora. # But first, I must survive this launch.... # "... Come in. Mitch, curse it all, are you asleep up there? Cam Mitchell! " # My mind snaps back to the here and now. My eyes lock onto the two clocks on my console. Launch clock and launch-window clock. The latter makes plain that either I launch soon, or not at all. # I do my best to sound confident. " What 's up, Mission Control? " # " Hold is released. " And as if the words themselves held power, the long-static @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good, Mitch. " # I have been offered such encouragement several times before. But at this juncture, we have passed the final scheduled hold. Perhaps the impossible will happen. # As the countdown enters single digits, I dare to believe. # I emerge, disoriented, from blacking out. # Nothing on the brightly lit console immediately registers. I take solace from what little of my circumstance can grasp. That the pressure of acceleration has eased. That the roar of engines has abated, whether from the thinning of the atmosphere or because I was unconscious through jettisoning the rocket 's massive lower stages. That Mission Control 's murmurs in my ears seem calm. Mostly, I find comfort in the fact I have awakened at all. Fiery death in a launch-pad explosion had seemed all too probable. # The few functions of the launch not controlled from the ground take place automatically. For this phase of the mission, a trained monkey could serve as well. Or even an untrained monkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not that anyone but a bookish antiquarian would think of monkeys. None are to be found on Paradise of this era. Perhaps no monkey was ever on our world. The sum of anyone 's knowledge of monkeys comes from a brief entry in the ancient dictionary, a relic believed older even than the Cure. But the little sketch accompanying that definition, that caricature of a person? A simian test pilot somehow seems right, if perhaps only because my thoughts remain foggy.) # Outside the capsule 's tiny window, the sky darkens. Stars begin to appear. # " Final stage engine cutoff in three... two... one. " # Together with the sudden silence, any sense of down... vanishes. I scarcely notice the quick jolt as the rocket 's third stage separates from my capsule. # After a moment of glorious relief, my stomach heaves. Empties. Heaves again. And again. These spasms must announce themselves through medical telemetry, because apart from a " You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Mission Control leaves me in peace for a while. # As my capsule coasts upward, without action or intervention on my part, my thoughts resume their anxious wandering. # Amid the mission 's many uncertainties, I am confident of a few things. That I travel to all that remains to be discovered of a lost Golden Age. That like any Golden Age-at least, so my studies suggest-this one is shrouded in mystery. Shrouded, even, in myth. But one thing can not be questioned : that we on Paradise have, with much toil and travail, emerged from a Dark Age. That I go to explore an artifact that might greatly accelerate our progress. # In view of the curse our ancestors placed on their progeny, surely they owe us that much.... # " What 's it like? " Mission Control asks. # Like my stomach yearning to be free. Like my head, throbbing, trying its best to explode. But all the world is listening, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show more dignity. Swallowing hard, I summon some. " Truly amazing. " # I 'm not the first human to be in space. But are Paradisians still human? Our grasp of genetics remains far too elementary for biologists to reach an informed judgment. # Documentary evidence, what very little has survived, and myth support a scant few conclusions. That upon reaching Paradise, our socalled " Firster " ancestors chose to adapt themselves to the planet. That the change, in somewise ill-conceived, over generations rendered their descendants savage, all but drove them to extinction. And that later visitors( according to some legends, a mere two : a man and a woman) -by setting into motion the process which led, generations later, to the Cure-in some manner modified us again. # At the least, I know myself as a progeny of humans. As a long-lost child of long-lost Earth. # By any objective measure, my trip into orbit is quick. A few adjustment bums of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the complexities of navigation in space are a topic I do not pretend to understand), the wait seems interminable. # I had launched wearing a spacesuit, but not its helmet-that deferred bit of accouterment fortunate, considering the unpleasant bouts of nausea. Twice Mission Control suggests I eat something, reminding that, once I latch on my helmet, I 'll be limited to water laced with a few nutrients. Even the mention of food makes my gut lurch. I rustle a foil bag near the microphone to placate my minders. # " The target should come into view any moment now. " Mission Control finally advises. " Let us know. " # I would, except I am for the moment speechless. # Of course I had known what to expect. In theory. With the invention of the telescope, Big Ship became more than a brilliant spark racing across the night sky. And for generations since that first magnified view, the imagination and energies of Paradise 's best minds have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally otherworldly artifact. # For it is an artifact, clearly. More or less cylindrical. Also, huge.( Miles long? Miles across? Maybe. For no logical reason, I choose to believe so.) Regardless-and the method of the determination is beyond me-scientists say Big Ship is longer than any building on the planet is tall. # In even the oldest extant legends, this fastmoving spot of light was referred to as Big Ship. Why? And by what reasoning could primitives have concluded it was big? Tradition suggests the name arose somehow from contrast with another ship, or ships, known to the ancients. As varied as these folk stories are, all agree upon one essential detail : that any such lesser ship, or ships, is long gone. Vanished. Lost. # Have these legends any basis in fact? None can say-and yet, I most fervently hope so. # Modem biology insists people and the few four-limbed animal types are closely related to one another, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are, indeed, not native to this world, then some sort of ship, or ships, must have brought our ancestors and our four-legged animal kin to the surface. Whether by seismic event or volcanic eruption, tsunami or forest fire, primitives scavenging for materials or simply the ravages of time, all traces of such ship might later have been obliterated. # The overall cylinder I now study has few prominent features, mostly spars or antennas protruding from the hull. The large, diskshaped features of the one flat end are hypothesized to be access panels of some type, perhaps for loading and off-loading cargo or smaller ships. Apparatuses of some kind protrude from the cylinder 's opposite end-part of a propulsion system, it is supposed. And viewed at any scale, whether with modest binoculars or through astronomers ' most powerful telescopes-and now, from up close, with my naked eyes-the entirety of this enormous structure bears streaks and scars. It seems ineffably old. # I manage to report to Mission Control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deterioration accumulated throughout Big Ship 's long journey from another star? Had meteors struck, again and again, during the untold ages through which Big Ship has circled Paradise? This, too, is unknown. All anyone knows for certain is that Big Ship has arced across our sky back to the dim past revealed in ancient texts and folklore. # Scientists insist Big Ship once had a far higher orbit, only to gradually descend. Ancient texts agree-or, at least, those texts preserve how, over the ages, Big Ship 's trip across the sky became shorter and shorter. I must defer to the astronomers that a speedier orbit is also a closer-in one. # Why would an initial orbit have decayed? Scientists speak of occasional solar flares that briefly expand our atmosphere and the extent of its drag. Of perturbations to Big Ship 's orbit from the faint gravitational tug of other planets, or of Paradise 's three natural moons. Some speculate about electromagnetic interactions with the planet 's magnetic field, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason, it no longer matters. # Big Ship 's days-literally, days! -are num- bered. Its orbit grazes the wispy top of our planet 's airy skin, dipping lower and lower with each pass. This irreplaceable artifact- the very origin of Earthly life on Paradise? - must soon plunge to its death. To break apart and burn to cinders in its final plunge? Perhaps. Or as our scientists most fear, to penetrate, more or less intact, through the atmosphere? The impact would unleash untold havoc upon us and our world. # If either end befalls Big Ship, ancient clues to our origins, and to the technologies of our forbears, will likewise be lost in that final, cataclysmic plunge. # With untried technology barely able to deliver one person to a low orbit, with scarcely time to prepare for a single launch, it falls to the most implausible candidate to visit the doomed vessel before the end. Because, as things turn out, it is more expedient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its controls, and to cope with a spacesuit, than to instruct a pilot or scientist or engineer on the intricacies of English. # For it is surely in that ancient language that any labels, instrumentation, or( dare I hope) documents aboard Big Ship will be written.... # Controlled from the ground, my tiny capsule approaches Big Ship. I study it as no Paradisian has done before. In the bright, unfiltered sunlight, the scarring of ages is ubiquitous and undeniable. As the ancient vessel tumbles, I see puncture after puncture in the ancient hull. # Mission Control interrupts my survey. " The orbit is decaying a little sooner than expected. We have to move faster. " # We. As if anyone below would be stepping out into space. " I was supposed to have at least a day. " # " We 'll see how it goes. Orbital-decay prediction is n't an exact science. " And added defensively, " We do n't have a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact, beyond two very brief tests : the first, little more than an orbiting radio ; the second, a quick up-and-down to determine if a dog would survive. But however inexact, science predicted Big Ship 's imminent plunge to its fiery doom. And as for anyone 's lack of experience? Neither theirs nor mine had stopped them from approaching me. # Not that I had argued. The first Paradisian into space. The first-perhaps, the only-Paradisian to board Big Ship. Nor had I hesitated as Big Ship 's prognosis grew ever more dire. Not even after resources were diverted from readying a backup/rescue rocket and capsule to expedite prepping a single launch. My launch. Because time was running out.... # " Understood, " I say. " I 'll take whatever I can get. " # As I have been taught, I snap two oxygen tanks to the receptacles on my chest-a placement at once awkward and accessible. I set and twist my helmet, and it latches with a reassuring click @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow into the bulky suit, and communications using the helmet. I take a test sip from the helmet 's nipple-like water port. Everything operates as expected. I allow myself to believe : perhaps this will work. # I unbuckle from my padded seat, shut off the capsule 's oxygen supply, and open one of the capsule 's hatches. As a clipboard I had neglected to secure blows out of the capsule, I brace myself to make, and to reenter, history. # Mission Control wants me to gra&thorn;ple and winch the capsule onto Big Ship 's flat end. As the enormous object gyrates( at random, as best I can tell) about all three axes, that is clearly impossible. An alternate approach, to dock at or near mid-cylinder, is-and Mission Control reluctantly concurs-the only viable option. # I take as a good omen that within Big Ship 's comparatively stable central extent is what appears to be an air-lock hatch. # Ungainly in my bulky protective gear, I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of its long cable, to adhere to Big Ship. And so, one worry is assuaged : the hull is, as reflected light somehow suggests, magnetic. Or ferromagnetic. Whatever meant grapples would hold fest. # Mission Control, peering through my helmet camera, rejects the magnet 's attachment as too distant from Big Ship 's waist-the closest we can expect to come to stability. I tug loose the grapple, carefully retract its cable, and cast again. On my tenth try, the grapple 's placement passes muster. I energize the grapple 's powerful electromagnet. # There is no need to engage the cable 's small motorized winch. Big Ship 's rotation is already winding up cable at a rate too quick for comfort. That with my clumsy tossings and retrievals I 've also set my capsule wobbling makes my stomach lurch anew. It 's ironically fortunate that I 've kept nothing down to befoul my helmet. # My capsule has three hatches, evenly spaced around the cabin. Hastily, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Ship and stars, careen from opening to opening, with my inner ears doing somersaults and my gut in spasm, I flip the switch that inflates the capsule 's shock-absorbing bumper. That 's little more than a wraparound air mattress : one more improvisation in a mission full of them. # And with the gentlest of thumps, felt through my suit, rather than heard, my capsule meets Big Ship. It is as if-another of those inexplicable concepts from a long-lost past-I have touched the Face of God. # Through an air mattress. # Unbuckling, I lob more magnetic grapples, attached to much shorter cables, out the two unobstructed hatches. As I gather up slack on ratchets, the rattle-and-bump of the capsule- and the clatter of my teeth-slows and, finally, stops. My capsule is now nose-in to Big Ship at its waist. # " Ready to attempt boarding, " I inform Mission Control. # " Boot magnets on and tether attached, " they remind me unnecessarily. Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have forgotten. # Stepping out onto the great hull, I find myself bathed in a soft blue light. Irresistibly, I look up- # Without warning, my perspective flips. / am up. Paradise, incomparably beautiful-and huge-and fragile-looms beneath me. It is a very long way to fall.... # My heart pounds. My gut clenches, and my bowels rumble. I stand, transfixed. Immobile. Terrified. # People murmur. Raise their voices. Shout. I process none of it. Until- # " Cam! " a familiar voice calls out. My wife 's voice. # With a deep, shuddering breath, I calm myself. " I 'm all right. I made the mistake of looking... " # " Just do n't, " Mission Control interjects. " Keep your eyes on the hull until you 're inside. # " You need to concentrate, " my wife says softly. In English. # On the threshold of ancient mysteries, I find myself questioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Firsters once spoke. I tell myself it does n't matter. It matters only that we can read English. # If I make my way into Big Ship, there can be no one better able to assist me than my fellow scholar. Than the love of my life. In other circumstances, Mandy might be where I now stand, and I on the ground. But she is a halfyear pregnant : an ever scary and wonderful thought. # And her happy condition is also why she can not know the truly desperate nature of this undertaking. That secrets be kept has been my one nonnegotiable demand of Mission Control. # If everything goes as I hope, she need never know.... # Over what feels like geological time, I clank/sidle the few paces to the apparent air lock. The safety tether I trail( and how flimsy that lifeline seems!) also serves as my communications link back to the capsule and its radio. # The experts consider it unlikely in the extreme that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operates. If power to operate anything is, indeed, long gone, there is no assurance that I 'll find a manual override. Even if there ever was a manual override, the experts predict that hatches and frame have, over the ages, vacuum-welded into one solid mass. Lest the experts are correct, I carry explosives in my satchel. # I am terrified at the prospect of using them. # As predicted, nothing happens when I prod the obvious( labeled in English, while faded almost to illegibility)) p-n button. But when an access panel beside the hatch, equally obvious, slides aside to reveal an ordinary handle, and the hatch glides open as I crank, I hope that my expertise is not as misinformed.... # I unreel tether from the capsule, looping my leash into a palm-to-elbow coil. In the preparation phase, this had seemed a considerable length. Confronted with the reality of this enormous vessel? The tether 's length seems paltry. # Experts( on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying close-up imagery from my helmet camera, conclude that sealing the outer hatch behind me would sever my tether- and all contact with Mission Control. It seems all but inconceivable that any atmosphere remains inside( although no less believable than that I should be here at all). But lest they are mistaken and objects come hurtling out, I crank closed the outer hatch except for a crack to accommodate my tether. Only then do I start cranking open the inner hatch. # Nothing flies at me from within Big Ship. # After reopening the outer hatch, I make repeated treks between capsule and air lock with reels of tether extensions and replacement oxygen tanks. I have fond hopes of loading the capsule 's emptied cabinet with priceless artifacts. On my eighth return to the capsule, I grab a cloth satchel. It contains, mostly, facsimile editions( on tissue-thin paper, to save weight) of the precious few ancient texts to have come to us through the Dark Age. # And to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recopying them untold times, I give silent thanks. # Trailing tether, I step from the air lock into Big Ship. # It 's as if I have entered the darkest cave. Except where helmet lamps cast two spots of light, everything is hidden. My options seem limited to dim expanses at a distance, or welllit, tiny details seen close in. # To judge by grumbling picked up by Mandy 's microphone, Mission Control can discern even less than 1.1 ca n't pretend to understand what is involved in transmitting from orbit to surface, or in handing off the communications link from ground station to ground station as Big Ship tumbles along its orbit and Paradise rotates beneath-beyond that the video connection is expected to be low resolution and jeiky. And that at least half the time, Big Ship 's spin-and-wobble means no contact with the ground. # " Try sweeping your head side to side, " my wife suggests.( Stift in English. She would stay with English for as long as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, she would be the intermediary between Mission Control and me. I have far too much on my mind to be alternating every other utterance between English and Speak, no matter that scattered words of the latter seem to have their roots in the former.) # And so, magnetic boots holding me to the metal floor, I begin my explorations. I interpret ancient signs, often with as many letters faded away as remain legible. -che-. DiniRoo-. On the doors of what seem personal quarters are what I take to be personal names. A few names-like Amanda-are familiar. Most are not. # From time to time, relayed by Mandy, Mission Control advises, " Look to your right, " or " Get closer to that thing on the floor, " or other such. And once- # " On your... le-eft- " # There is no mistaking that catch in her voice. " Mandy! What 's wrong? " # " Nothing. Just the little one kicking me in the bladder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy. Amanda, if we have a girl. The ancient forms of our names. We are, after all, both antiquarians. " Tell him or her I said to behave. " # Mandy laughs. " Will do. Now open that door to your left, and let the engineers have a look inside. " # A corridor I am exploring ends abruptly in a featureless partition. # Mandy directs my attention to a nearby panel inset in the wall. Inside are control buttons( inoperative, of course) and a cranking mechanism as at the air lock. Cautiously, I turn the handle, and the partition slides a short way aside. # " Emergency bulkhead, " a man 's laint voice offers in Speak. " I would think automatic. Because of those punctures we saw earlier. Because of air loss. " # " Emergency bulkhead, " Mandy repeats in English. # On my side of the partially retracted partition, random items float and jostle about. On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gyrations must keep anything unattached in ceaseless motion. Only magnetic boots prevent me from bouncing around, and not even the boots can keep me from swaying and twisting. My ankles and knees throb from the abuse. # " Maybe so, " I say. " But then I do n't understand the detritus everywhere, even in exterior compartments. Would n't those have been sucked out into space? " # I go on exploring while, on the ground, people consider my question. And the answer, when it comes, is only what I already know. Big Ship is old. Old enough for its air to have seeped away. Old enough that, on the world below, whatever science and culture this vessel had brought, and almost even language itself, had been lost.... # Once again, having explored where intuition or signage has directed me, I find myself at the end of my tether : a situation altogether too apt. Once again, I backtrack to obtain slack and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tether serves me as guide. Without it, in this maze of corridors, I would struggle to retrace my steps. Throughout, the little camera mounted to my helmet relays images to Mission Control. # Everywhere, I find marvels : some identifiable, others not. I recognize more than enough-here, tables and chairs, there, a child 's abandoned toy-to be certain : in some ancient past, the occupants of this vessel were my ancestors. It was they who settled Paradise. And they who( as ancient tradition insisted long before a science of biology could offer hints of confirmation), by changing themselves to Uve on our world, had all but doomed their descendants. The climb back from that ecological trap has been... excruciating. # In what feels like a kitchen, I come across books of recipes, schedules of some kind, and what I infer are menus. Many of these words elude me and, once again, Big Ship 's gyrations have interrupted my radio link to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defy stiff glove fingers. My curiosity unsatisfied, I tuck a randomly selected cookbook into my satchel and hurry on. # Because nothing so far encountered advances the mission. # What I beUeve must be a bedroom-there are many such-offers up a few thin volumes, with scant( faded) words and large( faded) illustrations : children 's books. A room labeled Nurs-r- offers a very Paradisian-appearing doll. I tuck these precious artifacts into my satchel. # Here and there are objects that Mission Control guesses might be electronics, even computers. I deposit these at the air lock for now.( A computer no larger than a book, rather than filling a large room? It seems impossible, absurd. But so is the concept our ancestors once built this place. For all our long, hard scrabbling up from a Dark Age, there is no escaping how far we have yet to go.) # At some academic level, I feel sure these items will prove interesting, even informative. But at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his roots? In search of ancient truths? I feel only crushing disappointment. # And beyond all that, foreboding and portents of failure. # The latest corridor I am exploring widens into a sort of lobby. To my left are four sets of sliding doors ; to my right, three sets. All the doors are closed. Elevators, I infer, no different than I would find in a tall building on Paradise. # Of course I 've found elevators. By comparison with the ceiling close above my helmet, Big Ship has hundreds of levels. # One end of the lobby has a simple wall plaque, showing seven colored stripes in rainbow order. Belatedly, I realize the elevatordoor colors also span the rainbow. The graphic is a stylized representation of Big Ship, and a dedicated elevator serves each section. I entered Big Ship at its middle, and the centermost of the seven stripes is green. # Alongside each door is a button labeled in age-faded letters. Eng-e Ro- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Most labels I interpret easily. But Recr-ti-n stymies me. Recreation, is the best I can come up with. But to recreate what? # " Bridge? " I muse aloud of the final elevator. But why? A bridge is a structure to span a river, road, or other physical obstacle. Metaphorically( metaphor itself being a concept absent from Speak), a bridge can connect any two disparate things. " Spanning what? " # I hear pages flutter : Mandy consulting her copy of the dictionary. " I think bridge has some unrelated meanings, " she says. " Ah. The bridge is also the part of a ship from which control is exercised. " For a short while I hear only muffled sounds. I picture Mandy cup- ping her microphone with a hand. " Mission Control wants you to look around for a stairwell. If you find one, they want you to get to the bridge level. " # They can not desire that more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits at an end-just where Big Ship 's tumbling made it impossible for me to dock. I am far from my goal. # I push the button marked Br-d-e. Nothing happens, of course. Nor do I locate a stairwell nearby, as I would find alongside any elevator at home. Perhaps Firster elevators never broke. # All too aware of the timepiece buckled around my suit 's right wrist, I widen my search. # " Your oxygen is down to a day-tenth, " Mandy comments. " Maybe head back to your stash for a refill. " # The air lock and several spare tanks are a short walk away.( Unless, that is, in my wandering I 've again wrapped the tether around a long circuit of rooms.) " That 's plenty, at least until I find a stairwell. When I do, I 'll grab a new tank. " # I heard... something. A tentativeness? A short intake of breath. " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decaying faster than predicted. Half a day-tenth to the point of no return. " The disappointment in her voice is clear. " You need to finish up. " # If she had had any idea what Mission Control 's forecast truly signifies, disappointment would be the least of her emotions. # " Understood, " I answer. # The stairwell we all believe must exist somewhere turns up, of all unexpected places, near the air lock through which I had boarded. Behind an ordinary door( Sta-r-) is a small landing. Until the curvature of the hull hides the stairway from sight, ordinary steps and risers lead toward both ends of the ship. On the door 's stairwell side, in pale letters against a faded green background, I read Reden-e 32. Thirty-two, at the least, residential levels like this one I have but partially explored? As much as transportation, Big Ship had also been a city. # I wedge open the door with a screwdriver from my tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe) Big Ship 's bridge. The first door I glimpse is labeled -esid-e 33. # Two flights nearer to the ship 's flat end and, I estimate, with my tether half used, I come upon a door marked, Recr-at-n 1. The tumbling is already worse than where I boarded, my ankles and knees more abused than ever, and I 'm gasping from exertion. While I catch my breath, I might as well have a peek. With a screwdriver wedging open this stairwell door, I go through. Mandy gasps. # As do 1.1 have come to a vast library. # Eyes wide with wonder, I approach the closest row of shelves. Elastic bands secure the volumes, their bindings faced out, in the absence of gravity. If what strikes me as names are names, then the only organization here is alphabetical by author. # Striding farther into the room, I see labels on shelf ends. " Fiction. That 's stories. Madeup stuff. Right? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library. After many more shelves of fiction, I come to tables and chairs, plus many of the devices someone on the ground thinks might be computers. # Past the tables, the march of shelving units resumes. The next row I come to bears the label Gen-ra- Refe-ence. My eyes open farther at the range of topics covered. # " You need to get on toward... " Mandy urges, her voice fading as, once more, Big Ship 's tumbling removes capsule and its radio from line of sight with Paradise. # Toward the bridge? It 's doubtless what she intended, but a glance at my wrist shows it no longer matters. Never mind several back-andforths to stage oxygen tanks and reels of extender reel. Without any of that, I still could n't reach the bridge in the time left to me. # Instead, I continue : past row upon row of shelving units, at a loss to categorize the contents any more narrowly than science, technology, and history. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seat myself at one of the library tables, to read and read and read. # And neither is possible. # I find myself in tears. So much knowledge. So much about our heritage. # "... Right away, " Mandy says. # " Say again? " # " Cam... you need to hurry. " # I hear the fear in her voice. Does she suspect? Does she know? # Mission Control interrupts, in Speak. " You can stop looking, Mitch. We 're out of time. " # What is it I feel? Frustration? Loss? Rage? All three, surely. And overriding everything else is deep, gut-wrenching regret. Because I know what happens next. # " The capsule 's retro rockets...? " # " What about them? " Mission Control responds. # " They will raise Big Ship 's orbit? Buy this place some time? " # " A few ten-days, perhaps. " Mission Control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage to time firing of the rockets just right. " More hesitation. " A thrust delivered along the cylinder 's main axis would have been easier to balance. " # Which had been their plan all along. # And what had been my plan, for the short while the mission could spare for me to try it? # Legends said the lost, small ships conversed, took orders, perhaps even synthesized the Cure. I had hoped to awaken here just such a artificial mind. And that if no breathable atmosphere remained aboard, or my pronunciation were garbled, the awakened intelligence could perhaps nonetheless read my English-speaking lips through my helmet or decipher a handwritten note. Two short words would suffice : Boost orbit. As I hoped that, no matter the toll of ages, Big Ship somehow retained the capacity to propel itself. # And finally, if all that should come to pass before Big Ship 's decaying orbit approached the point of no return, I would load my capsule with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Now that vanishingly slim hope has vanished. # And yet, something must be done to prevent this huge mass from crashing onto Paradise. From plunging our people into a new Dark Age-if anyone below could survive at all. # Something : Mission Control 's no less desperate plan. # " A long enough reprieve, " I persist, " to complete and launch the backup rocket and capsule? To give Big Ship an additional shove? " # " Perhaps, " they equivocate. # " No! " Mandy shouts. That I might be marooned here is news to her. " Even if it works, you 'll run out of oxygen within two days. You 'll die. Alone. Get back to your capsule, Cam. Now. Come back to Paradise. Come back to me and to your child.

Bar is another of those English words having a ridiculous number of unrelated meanings.) In front of the bar stands a row of tall stools. Behind the bar, in wall-mounted cabinets with clear doors, is an assortment of glassware.
