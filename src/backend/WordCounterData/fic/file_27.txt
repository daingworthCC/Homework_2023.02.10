1004241 Once upon a time there lived an elf named Frederick. He was walking around the woods. Frederick saw a cave and decided to go in. He saw a HUGE dragon( one hundred feet tall). The dragon 's name was Dibbs. He was roasting fish heads with his fiery breath. <p> Frederick was shocked! He had never seen a real dragon! Frederick tried to run, but he was so scared that he stepped on a loose branch and it broke. It made a loud CRACK! <p> Dibbs heard this, and he looked around and saw Frederick. <p> Frederick tried to hide, but there was no place to hide. Dibbs said, " I 'll grind your bones to make my bread! " <p> Frederick said, " You will lose your fire. " <p> " How do you know? " Dibbs asked. <p> " I read it in a book, " Frederick said slyly. <p> " What book? " replied Dibbs. <p> " The-The **42;0;TOOLONG book, of course. " <p> Well, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> " Do you want to lose your fire? " questioned Frederick. <p> " NOOOO! " Dibbs screamed with fire. <p> " Well then, you 'd better not eat me! Enjoy your fish heads, and I 'll be on my way, " Frederick said hopefully. <p> " Oh yes, " said Dibbs, " I must be on my way to the library to reread-cough, cough-that book you mentioned, one more time.
