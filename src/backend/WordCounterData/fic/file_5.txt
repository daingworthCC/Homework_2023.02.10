Mr. Dick : You think not? Betsey : Of course not! She would have lived with her Godmother, and we would have been devoted to each other. Now, Mr. Dick. Do n't stand there woolgathering. What shall I do? Mr. Dick : Why, if I were you, I should... I should... I should wash him! Belsey : Of course! Mr. Dick sets us all right! Mr. Dick : His clothes have fleas. Betsey : Burn them. Whatever possessed your poor mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love. Setser. And what business did she have doing that? Look what falling in love did for Betsey Trotwood. My husband treated me falsely and cruelly. Thats what men do, as far as I can see. Mr. Dick : He died in India. Trampled by an elephant. Betsey : Mr. Dick! Would you please go and find this boy some clothes. I shall run the bath! Narrator : Aunt Betsey wrote Murdstone that I was found. He and his sister arrived the next day.

And if you trespass on my green again, Miss Murdstone, I 'll knock your bonnet off and tread upon it! Narrator : Aunt Betsey sent me to a fine school in Canterbury, where I boarded with Wickfield, her old friend and trusted attorney. Wickfield 's wife had died young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his daughter, Agnes. I adored Agnes as a sister. The only other member of the household was Uriah Heep, a thin young man with a cadavarous complexion, and clammy hands. David : I suppose you are quite a great lawyer, Uriah? Uriah : Me, Master Copperfield? Oh, no! I 'm merely " umble derk at present. I am the " umblest person going. I have much to be grateful for in Wickfields kind employment. David : Perhaps you 'll be a partner in Wickfield 's business one day. Uriah : Oh, no. Ambition ai n't for me. A person like myself had better not aspire. If he is to get on in life, he must get on " umbly. Narrator : I grew to be a man, and the time came for me to find my place in the world. David : I must go upstairs and pack. I leave at first light. Agnes : I have already done it for you, my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heep slid into the room with an oily smile. Uriah : Wickfield! There is a matter that demands your attention. Immediately. Wickfield : Yes, Uriah. Of course, Uriah. Whatever you think best. Uriah : I most " umbly bid you farewell, Master Copperfield. Narrator : Unease settled over me as I watched Wickfield follow Uriah like an obedient dog. David : Agnes, what has happened between Uriah and your father? Agnes : Do not concern yourself. T will look after Father. David : As you have always done. Dear Agnes, as dear to me as my own sister! Narrator. Tears fell from her eyes. Little did I know, though, of all that was in her heart. Narrator : I could hardly ask my aunt to support me in my precarious ambition to be a writer, so instead I became a clerk for a proctor named Spenlow. Alone in London again, months slipped by in dull succession. Then one day everything changed. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dora, recently returned from Paris. Narrator : Dora was the most ravishingly pretty girl I had ever seen. Dora : Have you ever been in Paris, Mr. Copperfield? David : Paris? Dora : It 's in France. David : Yes, of course. I mean, no. Never. Narrator : I had fulfilled my destiny. I was a captive and a slave. I loved Dora Spenlow and was determined to win her heart. Narrator : I wrote Dora dozens of love letters, but she kept her feelings secret. One night, to preserve my sanity, I joined Agnes at a party. It was to be a night of curious meetings. David : Agnes! I have so much to tell you... why, Uriah Heep! Er, how are you? Uriah : Much obliged for your condescension to an " umble person, Master Copperfield. Take no notice of me.

David : I utterly adore her. What about you, Agnes? Have you admirers to tell me about? Narrator : I should have noticed a revealing hesitation, but I was distracted by a familiar voice. Steerforth : My God! Little Copperfield! You have n't changed a bit, Daisy. David : Steerforth! I 'm overjoyed to see you. This is Miss Wickfield. I. Steerforth : You have the prettiest girl in the place on your arm, Daisy! Agnes : Why do you call him Daisy, Mr. Steerforth? Steerforth : Merely a nickname from school. Listen, Daisy, you must call on me. I want to know all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here 's my card. A pleasure, Miss Wickfield. David : What luck! Agnes : I do n't know, David... sometimes it is wiser to leave the past alone. Narrator : When I left the party, I found to mv dismay that Uriah Heep was right behind me. Uriah : Did you think Miss Agnes looked very beautiful tonight? David : Superior to everyone around her. Uriah : With what pure affection do I love the ground she walks on! David : Does she know of these... feelings? Uriah : Oh, no. You see, I am just emerging from my lowly station, But I rest my hopes on mv usefulness to her father. I think she may come, on his account, to be kind to me. Narrator : I was about to rebuke him for his insolence when we were interrupted by a tradesman shouting up at the closed windows of a small house. Tradesman : You pay me, or Ill be back with the law next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knocked at the door. David : Mr. Micawber! Its David Copperfield!

Narrator : Steerforth and I decided to spend a few days at the sea. We arrived in Yarmouth in the midst of a celebration. Peggotty : Dearest darlin@ Davy! If only your mother could see you now! Photograph As his Aunt Betsey looks on, David introduces Dora, now his fiancee, to Agnes. <p> Dan : You two gentlemen have come to this here roof on the happiest night of my life. Emily, who I brought up from o baby and love better than a daughter, is going to be married! David : Who is the lucky fellow? Dan : Who else but Ham? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. There ai n't a gentleman in all the land nor sailing upon the sea-that can love his lady more than I love her. Steerforth : I wish you Joy. May you always be as happy as you are tonight. Narrator : During the next few days, I often noticed Steerforth and Emily gazing at each other, but I thought nothing of it. One night, I found Emily staring out to sea. Emily : I am not good enough for Ham. I 'm cross and changeable with him, when he is never so to me. It would be better for him if he had found someone else. David : Ham would rather die than be with anyone but you. Once you are married, all these fears will fall away, Emily. I know it. Narrator : I did n't understand what troubled her, nor did I comprehend what was on Steerforth 's mind the night we left Yarmouth. Steerforth : If anything should ever separate us, you must promise me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that for me? Remember me at my best? Narrator : Never again would I take his hand in friendship. May God forgive you, Steerforth. I can not. Narrator : I came home to find Aunt Betsey and Mr. Dick atop a pile of luggage in my flat. Aunt Betsey had lost her fortune in some mysterious way ; we soon agreed to live together. David. I 've often thought about writing. I could write in the mornings before I go to Spenlow 's. Betsey : A fine idea. We must always meet our reverses boldly. Mr. Dick : Boldly! Narrator : I also boldly declared my love to Dora, who, thankfully, promised to marry me. David : This must be our secret. I can not speak to Mr. Spenlow until I begin to make my fortune. Dora : A secret engagement! How romantic, Davy. David : Now, Dora, when we are married, our income may be small. We must try to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It frightens me so! David : If you could do some of the housekeeping, and perhaps study a cookery book... Dora : Are you determined to scare me out of my wits? Kiss me and stop being so disagreeable. Narrator : I was thrilled to oblige. Love i truly blind. Narrator : The Wickfields invited me to dinner, where I discovered Mr. Micawber employed as a clerk by Uriah Heep. Micawber : The law is a great pursuit, si : to a man of higher imaginative powers such as myself! David : Do you see much of Mr. Wickfield? Micawber : Wickfield is a man of very excellent qualities, but he is-in short -- obsolete. David : I fear his partner seeks to make him more so. Micawber : My dear Copperfield, do not ask me, humble as I am, to speak of the affairs of my friend and protector, Mr. Heep. Narrator : After dinner, poor Mr. Wickfield sat pale as a ghost min his chair. Uriah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agnes, divinest of her sex. I adore her. David : Choose some other toast, Uriah, Uriah : Who else can propose it, if not the man who would be her husband? Wickfield( in agony) : Never! Uriah : Have you gone mad, Wickfield? You know I have a better right than any other man! Wickfield : Look at my torturer! Always at my elbow, whispering his venom, in my house, in my business, like a millstone around my neck, bringing me to ruin! Uriah : Take care. Without me you would have no house or business. Your safety is in my hands, Wickfield : Oh, what have I come to? My weakness has ruined me! Narrator : Wickfield stumbled from the room, with Agnes close behind. Uriah Heep smiled. Uriah : Have you ever picked a pear before it was ripe, Mr. Copperfield? I did that when I spoke of Miss Agnes. But the pear will ripen yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the room to find Agnes. Agnes : Father is recovering. David : Is there nothing that can be done? Agnes : He wants me to beg Uriah 's forgiveness. He is more in Uriah 's power than ever. David : Ca n't you tell me the secret source of Uriah 's hold over him? Agnes : Please do n't ask me, David. I can not tell you. David : Promise me you will never sacrifice yourself out of duty, Agnes. You ca n't many that reptile! Agnes : Good night, David. Narrator : It was with a hea-,, N, heart that I made my way to the office the next morning, only to find that another catastrophe awaited me. Mr. Spenlow slapped a pile of papers tied in lavendar ribbon on my desk. They were my letters to Dora. Photograph <p> Spenlow : You have abused my confidence and committed a dishonorable action! David : Sir, I love Dora! Spenlow : Miss Spenlow, if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak to me of love or engagements. My daughter is not to be thrown away on a derk. You must forget her! David : I 'll never give her up, sir sir? Mr. Spenlow, what 's wrong? Narrator : To my horror, Spenlow collapsed. Hours later, he died of a heart seizure. His death threw everything into confusion. I was desperate to see Dora, but she refused, blaming her father 's untimely end on our secret love. Narrator : I was moping over Dora when an urgent letter from Peggotty called me to Yarmouth. Ham : I would have died for her, Masr Davy! rd die for her now! Emily 's gone. And not alone. Narrator : Ham pulled a letter from his pocket and handed it to me.

Narrator : Dan Peggotty left his beloved home and sea to search far and wide for his Little Emily. Dan : If any hurt should come to me, remember the last words I left for my darling child were love and forgiveness. Narrator : When I returned to London, Betsey had news. Spenlow 's despair had been due to his deep debt. The firm was bankrupt ; Dora was now a penniless orphan. I found her at her home crying bitterly as all of the family possessions were packed up and sold to pay off creditors. David : It 's all right. I shall take care of you now. There 's no need to be afraid. Dora : But we have nothing! David : We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Narrator : Dora and I married, and I took with fear and trembling to authorship. I quickly began to make a steady income writing sketches for magazines. Dora tried hard to manage our home, but it was a disaster. I 'll never forget the first dinner she made for the Micawbers. David : Tbc mutton appears to be a trifle... undercooked. Perhaps we should start with the oysters, Dora. Dora : I am afraid there is something the matter with them Micawber : There 's nothing wrong! Capital oysters in fact, only... they 've never been opened, you see. All that 's required for a delightful repast is an oyster knife... if you have one, that is. Narrator : Micawber went off to search our chaos of a kitchen. Mrs. Micawber : Micawber is much changed, Mr. Copperfield. He is secretive. He is severe with his children. It is hard to bear.

Betsey : Judge Dora by the qualities she has, not by those she lacks. Narrator : Our second year of marriage was much happier, but then Dora lost a child and afterward her strength seemed to drain away. Betsey and Agnes helped me care for her. Dora : Agnes is so warm and kind. I wonder that you ever fell in love with me. David : How could I see you and not love you? Dora : Perhaps if I had been her friend a long time ago, I might have been more clever. You would prefer me if I was, would n't you? David : What nonsense! Dora : Is it? Are you sure? Narrator : Time passed. Anxious as I was about Dora, I never forgot Dan Peggotty, searching ceaselessly for Emily. At last, he found her in the slums of London, disgraced and abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together in Australia. Emily begged me to take a letter from her to Ham. I solemnly accepted her commission. When I arrived in Yarmouth a dreadful storm raging. I found Peggotty in the crowd gathered on the beach. Photograph <p> Peggotty : A dipper from Spain has foundered and she 's breaking up! There 's one lone survivor just offshore, but ca n't nobody get to him because of the terrible sea. David : Is there nothing can be done? Peggotty. It 's too dangerous. God have mercy on his soul. Narrator : The surviVor raised himself on the wreckage. Something about him was shockingly familiar. David : Steerforth! Narrator : Just then the crowd parted and Ham emerged, a rope around his waist. Peggotty : For Gods sake, Ham, do n't go in there. Ham : I ca n't stand by and watch a man drown. David : Ham. It 's Steerforth. Ham : I know. Narrator : He plunged into the boiling surf. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Ham struggling mightily to reach the wreckage. He held out his hand to Steerforth. Peggotty : He 's reached him! David : Haul them in! Pull! Pull! Peggotty : HAM! Narrator : The human chain suddenly fell back in a heap. The rope went limp. The men reeled it in desperately, only to find nothing and no one on the end. The next day, the bodies of both men washed up on shore. I knelt at Ham 's side, and pressed Emily 's letter into his giant fist. Narrator : When I returned to London, Micawber sent an urgent request for Betsy, Mr. Dick and I to come to Wickfield 's. We beheld Micawber in all his splendor as he confronted Uriah Heep. Micawber : This scoundrel employed me in the belief that I shared the baseness of his nature.

Betsey : Where is my property? Blame Mr. Wickfield, would you? I might have guessed all along that you were responsible for my ruin! Micawber : Thankfully, your money is quite safe, madam. Uriah : I only took it to ruin you, Copperfield. I have always hated you. You were against me and my love for Agnes. Agnes : Love! Your selfish, grasping desire would have forced me into a marriage I did n't want, and you talk of love? " Wickfield : Mr. Dick, will you go round to the Guildhall?

First came the Micawbers, dressed in oil-skins, hardy boots, and straw hats, with cooking implements dangling from their belts. Micawber : I am assured there are towns of some description in Australia, Mr. Copperfield, but I feel it Wise to be prepared. In short... fare-well, old friend. Narrator : Next came Dan Peggotty and Emily. Emily : When you gave Ham my letter, did he say an@, thing? David : His love is with you always. Emily : And did he send forgiveness?

Davy : We have been happy, Dora. Dora : Very happy. But you are clever, and I never could be. As the years went on, you would have wearied of your little wife. And I would have disappointed you... Will you ask Agnes to come up, Davy? I want to speak to her alone. Narrator : And so it was that Agnes was with my Dora when she died. I went as far away as I could, haunted by the ghosts of many hopes, many sorrows and regrets. I worked patiently until my first book was published. It was successfill ; I began another inmmediately.

David : Agnes... you love me? Agnes : I have loved you all my life. Do you remember how Dora sent for me the night she died? She told me that only I could occupy this empty space in your heart.
