1004041 o one, notices when they walk by, that I am brimming in the dorrways. This house, this place, and this body, I 've come in mourning to be born in. <p> -William Gass, In the Heart of the Heart of the Country <p> See <p> I am in someone else 's home, Looking in someone else 's mirror, and seeing myself. Staring at my reflection in a full-length mirror on the opposite wall, I look at tan line, the shape of my body, the length of my hair. I am surprised to see my stomach looks flatter and my skin darked in this room. I study myself. This image I see does not seem right-distorted and unfamiliar. Going to the window, I watch the children across the street play with their dog in the shade of a tree. They do not feel my gaze. I continue to watch, naked and alone in the room. I should not be doing this. I need to get dressed. I have an appointment. I do not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only stare outward. At first, I think the walls in Planned Parenthood are white. The numbing fluorescent glow of the clinic 's overhead light 's trick my eyes. But I am wrong- the walls are pink, a pink the color of a schoolgirl blush. They are not the pink of a pregnancy test, blaring a neon positive. They are not the pink of a face flushed with disbelief. They are not the pink of the chipped fingernail polish the woman wears who holds the test results in her hands for me to see. No, the walls are gentle and inviting, even in their deception. <p> Smell <p> I am greedy with the amount of lavender bath gel I use, wanting to sink under the weight of bubbles soap can not provide. If I were not housesitting, if I were home, I might be more frugal, more practical. But I am not home. I close my eyes and surrender to lavender, Mrs. Hamilton 's scent, which lingers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dry but forgotten during the packing, take on a soft womanly shape. <p> The contents of her make-up basket have been emptied : lotions, shampoos, toothpaste, all are gone. My things are here now, still housed in my travel bag, except for my clean underwear, waiting next to the bathtub. I soak in the tub until the last of the water is swallowed by the drain. I stay put until the porcelain cools, all the while smelling lavender which rises from my warm skin. I breathe in so much I am no longer able to smell anything. The scent, flowery and feminine, has moved inside of me. It will cling to my body for a while and then gradually slip away, without me knowing. <p> The room at the clinic is sterile, smelling like the inside of a band-aid box, only here I am not sure what wound is being covered, what cut protected. I can not see the doctor hidden behind the drape of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smell of his musky aftershave which leaks out like gas. That, and the weight of the sheet, choke me. The snap of a rubber glove reminds me of the countless exams I have had since I turned 18, the age when suddenly something inside me needed to be probed. As I have been trained to do, I press down now on the stirrups with my feet and keep quiet. <p> Taste <p> The red of the steak fills my stomach, meat grilled over gas, not charcoal like I am used to. The steak covers my plate, enough for two. I pick tomatoes heavy with ripeness from the Hamiltons ' garden for my dinner. With each slice, I try to swallow the warmth of summer days passing outside me. My lipstick marks the rim of the wineglass as I drink the rest of the chardonnay I found already opened in the refrigerator. Instead of eating at the table, I tuck my body between the meeting of two counters. When finished, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take out the trash, start the dishwasher, run the garbage disposal. I know how to neaten, tidy up, bring on order. I have spent years learning to be a gracious visitor. <p> After the surgery, I put on my pajamas, even though it is only mid-day I crawl into bed, but the sun bothers me, pestering me to get up, get on. I shuffle to the small kitchen and begin the process of making toast and tea, the meal my mother would make for me when I had a cold or the flu. She would carry the tray to my room and serve me in bed because I was her child and I was sick. I butter the toast, put honey on the warm slices, and wait for the tea to steep. I wonder why I am performing this ritual. I am fine. Really, I am fine. Really I hear my mother 's voice telling the child me that I have nothing to worry about. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me, make me whole. Like I once was. <p> Hear <p> The grandfather clock chimes the time. I look at my watch and see it is slow, several minutes behind the hour. I do not bother correcting it. Giving in to the end of the day, I walk upstairs to the guest bedroom that is mine for the days I am here. The voice of an absent daughter is heard in the heaps of wool sweaters, discarded t-shirts and worn tennis shoes, old albums, and books. I lie on the double bed, my head resting on two pillows, wishing for sleep. I wonder who else has been in this bed. Alone, I violate the memories of unseen couples, trespassing through their intimacies and shared confidences uttered between worn sheets. I sense kisses, touches, embraces, movements. Narratives hang just out of earshot, leaving me to make up the story, create the beginning, middle, and end. Alone in the dark, I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will listen. <p> Weeks after the surgery, school starts. As part of a persuasion unit I am required to teach, I listen to five speeches about abortion in one day from my students. Pro-life. Pro-choice. It is all so convincing when the room crackles with teenage indignation and certainty. Their minds can wrap around this issue with ease. They revel in a black and white definitive authority, one I do not remember having at 14 nor at 25. I disappear behind my desk and the responsibility of a grade book. I have been told a good teacher is impartial. And I am. With each mark of the red pen, I grow more silent. I fulfill the image the students have of me, succumbing to the one-dimensional existence they create for all teachers. In this world, I do not go to the grocery store, drink beer, swear, go to the bathroom, or have sex. <p> Touch <p> The Hamiltons told me to make myself at home during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I walk from room to room, turning on different lights, sitting on chairs and couches, stretching out on thick carpets. I try to make my mark, but my physical presence is temporary. The heat from my body is swallowed by the surroundings. When I leave, I go out slowly through the doorway, afraid the Daddy Long Legs that stretch thickly across the wooden door frame will fall on me. I walk away from the waiting house for the last time. My car glides down the gravel driveway, creating a stir of smoke signaling my departure to no one, as if I had never even been there. <p> Sometimes, still, when taking off clothes, I touch my body. The slope of my stomach, the curve of my hips, the shape of my breasts. With my hand, I can not take it all in. There is so much. And it is hard to stay still long enough. Something gets away, slipping between my fingers, imperceptible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impression fogged by steam or a bathroom mirror. There is no script for a response. I have never been taught how to mourn a loss for something I can not feel. <p> Author Affiliation
