1010841 Out the windows of my live-in clinic snowdrifts cover the trees. Only the tips of blue pines remain visible. It 's been snowing so long that beyond this marker and surrounding the house in all directions is an architecture of pure whiteness. From our spot high up on a hill, the house and yard have been stripped bare of snow by the wind as if some strange vacuum had occurred. The pole lamps near the barn show big flakes moving parallel to the ground. The blizzard ebbs and flows and mutes the sun-not even a glow remains, just a general directional change of intensity throughout the day-then its back to roaring black. In the night snowplows come and go bringing a yellow tunnel of light ; a muffled roar like a ship scraping bottom underscores but fails to answer the question : Who drives them and where are they dispatched from? Erin says that I am wrong, that there has n't been a snow plow in two weeks. I still hear them, I say. Sometimes they rumble past when she is asleep. " Then how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it never stops snowing. " " It 's like ashes, " she says, watching them fall. " Yes, " I reply, " but these melt on the tongue. " Erin is my live-in housekeeper, who refuses to cook and stopped cleaning weeks ago now. Because of the quarantine she is trapped here and spends her time in the blue reclining chair, painting different colors on her nails with that sullen pout she 's perfected since she ran out of cigarettes. That is, when she is not pacing from picture window to picture window, or trying out different stations on the small radio she carries with her wherever we go. " No music. Whoever heard of a radio station not playing music. It 's all flu all the time, " she says, looking over at me hoping I will crack a smile. The coffee maker gurgles awake in the kitchen. Caffeine is the only drug left on my shelves. What passes for antibiotics, flu antidote, is nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, a whole shelf of donated samples. The television fills the waiting room with a cold blue static, seeping into my dreams like an arctic light. Erin watches it expectantly, knowing that at any moment it could come to life and bring her back into the world. Seventeen days ago a Nor'easter spiraled up the coast, picking up moisture, changing direction, before it stalled in a giant vortex of snow and wind. Whole houses smothered. No patients have come to the door in days. We receive requests on the CB radio and make house calls using the snow machine the town gave me when I agreed to open the clinic just after finishing my residency. The old people who 've lived in Vermont for eighty, ninety years know people who knew people who spoke about the blizzards of the 1880s and 90s. Whole locomotives buried and no one thought it was the end of the world then, did they? They found shovels and dug tunnels to the barn where their cows screamed from udders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull blue light. They never worried that spring would not bring its dripping eaves and mad sparrows. Somewhere, beneath the tons of snow and the entombed trains, delirious crocuses lay ready to leap out of the mud. Nothing to worry about, no black clouds on the horizon. I believe in the oath, not that it matters to my patients anymore. My presence-the jarring nature of my advice-turns them incoherent and asleep on their feet. They see patterns, wallpaper speckled to please, but not the enormity of the event itself. all I have is my uniform, my stainless steel instruments. The snow machine still has enough gas to bum and so each day and night Erin and I head out on our rounds. On low in the background, my CB radio carries the voice of a woman patient, - some delusional plainspoken lawyer 's wife hallucinates a monologue into the microphone like an incessant far-off waterfall of words. She makes me sick with her pleading. They need. I must. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dying. " The woman said before she clicked off. I warm my hand around the coffee mug and hold it close to my face. Better to stay inside where it 's warm and dry. The voice never identifies itself with a name although they all sound the same when they beg through the radio. I want to rest, to turn the radio off and disappear into the warmth of my dreams. The house the woman called from should only be five miles away, if only we can manage to find the turn-offs and the bridges again. Erin will drive the machine and knows her way around this confusing country with its twisting hollows and maze of intersecting roads. Many of these roads are little more than ancient paths carved into the ridgelines by centuries of Algonquin feet. " What is your temperature? " Erin asks. " I 'm fine, " I say, knowing that I 'm burning up again, fighting off hallucinations and waking dreams. For two weeks I 've kept it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I get weaker each day the epidemic continues. " Most of these people you are visiting will die, " she says, turning and showing off her unnerving eyes. I must hold onto her belt or risk falling off and being lost in the snow. The shape of her hips and the smell of her neck I want to lose myself in. On more than one occasion she offered herself to me, and each time I declined. She opens up the throttle at the small plateau between steep hills. Nothing is moving but us. I close my eyes and lean into the noise. Soon an orange glow appears in front of the machine. My own fever has me slightly off balance, sweating and imagining that the light is a warning we should be moving away from instead of speeding toward. Just outside of Brandon a ranch house burns ; the flames higher than the melting snow drifts. A black plume of smoke moves into the white sky and disappears. Erin stops, idles the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is odd when the roof collapses and the walls fall inward. No people are visible. There seems to be no one within miles. As we near our destination, the woman 's directions become familiar. It is the giant rambling house of judge Wheatcraft and his wife. A brass plaque near the door claims circa 1791. Always immaculately preserved, the grounds clean of branches, the grass cut and with two yellow Labs asleep in the front yard. We leave the machine near the driveway and climb over the wooden fence because the gate is snowed shut with drifts. No telltale signs of life, no footprints in or out, and no snow cleared away. A muted yellow candle light illuminates the rooms from within and Erin claims to have seen the face of a woman from a second story window. I have been to this house many times in the past for parties and small dinner gatherings. The judge went to Dartmouth and his wife to Smith and they carried with them English furniture heirlooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but reclusive of late since both their sons died before them. The stone carriage entrance is the only porch that has been cleaned of snow and swept with a broom. Split wood is stacked up along its length and the sound of music comes from within the old kitchen where the couple spend most of their time during the winter. Erin clears away the frost on the window and peers in. Mrs. Wheatcraft 's face appears immediately at the door, absent her usual exuberant smile and lightness ; her face is clouded over and pained, eyes barely stopping to focus, and she turns quickly away from looking too closely at her guests. " Both of you come in, please, before you freeze. " " I did n't recognize your voice on the radio. " " My radio voice, no less. Well, step on in and I 'll make the drinks. Let me just go and get another bottle of gin from the freezer. You know what a fussbudget he is about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each day and started exactly at five. When I told him that the drink was " the only legal narcotic left in America, " he put his finger to his lips and whispered an admonition, " Please, please, keep it our secret then. " I have my medicine bag ready and stethoscope warming around my neck. " Should n't I go and see the judge, first? " She 's busy cutting cheese and arranging plates and ignores my question. " What 's it going to be today, doctor? The House special, as usual? " I nod and try to smile. " I really should go up and see the patient. " " We 're all patients these days, are n't we? " She gives me a quizzical look, her left eyebrow raised and twitching. " Anyway, cocktail hour is not optional in this house. " She leaves us alone and goes into the pantry to get something. Erin gives me her cross-eyed " what gives " look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this house at this time of day to have drinks. " " Do n't they know? " " She called us, remember. The judge is dying. Come immediately, and so on. " Mrs. Wheatcraft reenters the room holding a bottle of Blue Sapphire gin. " Have you two made up your minds about the drinks? Will you be joining the judge? " " Thank you, I will. " Erin nods her head in agreement, then winks at me. " He 's well enough to drink? " Mrs. Wheatcraft pauses, sets the bottle down, and clucks her tongue at me in a mock admonishing way that tells me how she must have once been seductive and graceful. The preparation for the judge 's martini is elaborate and painstaking : glasses are pre-chilled, gin measured out in advance and all the tools placed within easy reach. After emptying each glass of its ice she quickly pours the contents of the martini into a shaker, turns it over once, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green olive without a toothpick. We each carry a serving plate and head into the large front room, which serves as library and music room. Floor-toceiling bookcases cover all but one wall where an expensive stereo system is hidden behind shuttered doors. A black grand piano shares the floor with a haphazard collection of couches, settees and love seats. Mrs. Wheatcraft sits down at the piano, carefully placing her own drink on a waiting cork coaster. She opens the hood and begins to play Beethoven, showing off her years of lessons, her years of daily playing. Erin rolls her eyes at me again and sips carefully at her narcotic. She 's a smart local girl, prone to a streak of proletarian snobbery. Since I have been here before and there is no talk of the storm, no discussion of the snow, or any mention of sickness, I feel exhausted and ready to sleep. The drink warms outward, head and torso first, then works its way into my extremities. She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceiling, " Marshall Wheatcraft! " Erin nearly spills her drink. Then, in a softer tone, " I ca n't imagine what 's keeping him. " She begins the piece again, then abruptly stops and closes the lid. " Would you like some of the anti-viral pills? " I 'm afraid of letting too much silence accumulate. " You mentioned that he was ill. " " I 'm not a fool, Doctor, I know about the aspirin. Have you ever seen one religious icon in this house, outside of the mandalas in the mud room? " I had, indeed, seen the mandalas in the mud room. Treasure brought back from a trip to Nepal. " Look, " she says, " It 's snowing, " a look of astonishment and glee on her face, as if it were the first snow of the year falling unexpectedly on her lawn. Erin and I both turn to look out the floor to ceiling windows, each with a strip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panes are original and contain hand-blown glass that gives back intermittent patches of distortion. Erin excuses herself for the bathroom and motions to me with her eyes to distract Mrs. Wheatcraft while she looks around. " I 'll have to make him another drink now. That one is spoiled. He hates it when they get warm. " The temperature in this part of the house was cold enough that little puffs of condensation could be seen on our breaths. " Your furnace still working? " " Oh, that. Well, not exactly. We 've been burning wood now and look what I 've gone and done. I 've forgotten to start the other one for this part of the house. You know we practically live in that kitchen in the winter. " " Maybe I should go up and have a look at him now. " Her head slowly goes down and touches the piano, making a small thud. " Mrs. Wheatcraft? " She raises her head, tilts it to the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot in the distance. I hear the floorboards above our heads creak and know that it is Erin sneaking around up there. " He 's been upstairs for a long time, " she says, her eyes looking up as if she has heard the footsteps, too. I watch and wait for her to continue but she turns her head away and covers it with in her arms. In the harsh light coming through the windows she looks carved out of her seat at the piano, more an apparition than any real woman. From upstairs come more sounds of doors opening and closing, a whispering voice in an argument with itself. Erin is no longer being stealthy as before, although Mrs. Wheatcraft has n't moved or spoken in many minutes. I shudder at the coldness in the room and break into another awful fever sweat. " Why did you come all the way here in such bad weather? " " You called. " Pleading, I think, begging, and here we are drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world. If I could just close my eyes and rest, just nap for a brief ecstatic minute, I would feel fine again. " I love house calls. " She says this with an exaggerated stage voice. Garbo refusing to dance. " I have a machine-for the snow. " " You look a little pale, yourself, Doctor. " " Do n't worry about me, I 'll make it through. " " Too tough and special to die like the rest? " " I 'm as careful as I can be about protecting myself. " " So this visit is about your oath ; you come to save us, but sacrifice yourself? " " Mrs. Wheatcraft... I- " " -You throw yourself into the maw. Perhaps you 've gone too far this time. What if there 's no chance of getting back? " I am nervous from her questions and begin fidgeting with the buttons on my shirt. The house is hotter and hotter. " Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughs. " Not unless it started all by itself. " She points to her ear and makes a twisting motion with her hand. " It 's all in your head, dear. Feverish, beginning to hallucinate. I know it well. " " I have the snow machine. " " Yes, you certainly do. You mentioned it not a minute ago. " " When the town gave it to me I thought it was just a toy. " " This machine takes you from one world into the next? " " In a sense, Mrs. Wheatcraft, yes. Lately it 's taken me from one disaster to the next. " " Well, now you can relax and stay awhile. " She grows quiet again and the huge maples outside the windows groan and snap in the cold. " Is everything okay here? I mean, you called and seemed very upset. You said it was a matter of life and death. " " I did n't want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on her arms and closing her eyes. Her skin is so thin that her skull can be seen clearly outlined beneath. The fever sends a spasm through my body. " But you 're not alone. " " Exactly, " she says, her voice a whisper, as if it were coming from the center of her body instead of her throat. " I thank you for giving me that simple gift. I could n't bear it alone. And it 's so much better this way, do n't you agree? " Without asking I go to the drink tray and take the judge 's martini and drink it in two gulps. As the light fades in the room, the snow swirls in the front yard creating eddies and hypnotizing crosscurrent patterns. It is so quiet, the snow falling straight down as the wind eases, that I hear my heart pounding in my throat. I have to get out of this house and back to my own clinic. From this window during a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land in the middle of that great expanse of lawn. A familiar visitor for the Wheatcrafts, the heron came up from the nearby river to catch minnows in their small man-made pond. None of the other guests cared much or were used to seeing him there, so I was alone in going outside for a close-up look at this notoriously shy bird. When it sensed me moving it took flight and showed off its pre-historic design. A rhythmic noise like a low moaning brings me out of my reverie and I turn back to see if she is snoring at the piano. The face hidden beneath the pale arms is silent, - the sound came from upstairs. " Mrs. Wheatcraft? " She fails to stir. I go close and say her name again, then reach out and touch her arm and shake it back and forth. It falls from its place and hangs down. She has no pulse when I feel her neck. In the short space of time I had the memory of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come down the front staircase and I know it is Erin by the halting way she moves. Her silhouette appears in the opening between rooms but her features are out-of-focus. I walk toward her and see that her face is puffy and wet from tears. " Well? " We stare at each other for a few seconds before she speaks. " You 're covered in sweat. " " I 'm burning up. The furnace must have come on. " " It 's freezing in here. " " The judge? " " I did n't have to open the door to find him. " " Did you open the door? " She cries at the thought of what she has seen. I do n't tell her about Mrs. Wheatcraft but she can see for herself if she bothers to look. " He 's been in there for weeks. " She walks away toward the kitchen. " Where are you going? " " I have to go out and get some fresh air. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, hoping that she will wait. She laughs in that dismissive way of hers. " No you wo n't, " she says, her voice far away and coming from near the mud room. When I get there she is already gone. Her tracks go down the steps and disappear at the bottom, as if she had been swallowed up by the snow that is now as thick as fog. I call out her name but hear only the whistling and roaring. I look all throughout the house, calling her name, pleading that she appear and not be cruel at a time like this, in a situation already so hopeless. I do not open the door to the room that holds the judge, and I leave Mrs. Wheatcraft at the piano. It 's so hot inside that sweat pours down my face and makes my clothing stick to my skin. Some old song pulses through my head as I shed my clothes and finally feel the cool air. just a shadow passing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house mine to do with as I please. I careen off the walls, sending photographs crashing to the floor in the hallway. I grab my parka and drag it behind me out the same door that Erin disappeared from. The snowmobile is lightly coated with snow and when I turn the ignition button it purrs to an idle, its small headlamp pulsing with the slow breaths of the engine. Moving out into the dusk across an open field, the machine drives between the branches of a huge blue spruce and my coat is torn away. Ecstatic to be naked and moving quickly across the earth transformed-its order and glitter obliterated. The snow is so deep, I skim along the tops of the trees. The idea of my own house seems to recede as I move toward it ; my skin grows warmer and warmer until I am radiating like a furnace. Laughing, now. There are no tracks ahead of my machine, no breaks in the original surface into which I am carving lines.
