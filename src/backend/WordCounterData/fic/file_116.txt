1017841 Exactly when the ball began Leila would have found it hard to say. Perhaps her first real partner was the cab. It did not matter that she shared the cab with the Sheridan girls and their brother. She sat back in her own little corner of it, and away they bowled, past waltzing lampposts and houses and fences and trees. <p> " Have you really never been to a ball before, Leila? But, my child, how too weird -- " cried the Sheridan girls. " Our nearest neighbor was fifteen miles, " said Leila softly, gently opening and shutting her fan. <p> Oh, dear, how hard it was to be indifferent like the others! She tried not to smile too much ; she tried not to care. But every single thing was so new and exciting.... Meg 's tuberoses, Jose 's long loop of amber, Laura 's little dark head, pushing above her white fur like a flower through snow. She would remember forever. It even gave her a pang to see her cousin Laurie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fastenings of his new gloves. She would like to have kept those wisps as a keepsake, as a remembrance. <p> But of course, there was no time. They were at the drill hall already ; there were cabs in front of them and cabs behind. <p> " Hold on to me, Leila ; you 'll get lost, " said Laura. <p> " Come on, girls, let 's make a dash for it, " said Laurie. <p> Leila put two fingers on Laura 's pink velvet cloak, and they were somehow lifted past the big golden lantern, carried along the passage, and pushed into the little room marked " Ladies. " <p> Two benches on either side were stacked high with wraps. Two old women in white aprons ran up and down tossing fresh armfuls. And everybody was pressing forward trying to get at the little dressing table and mirror at the far end. <p> A great quivering jet of Sas lighted the ladies ' room. It could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened again and there came a burst of tuning from the drill hall, it leaped almost to the ceiling. <p> Dark girls, fair girls were patting their hair, tying ribbons again, tucking handkerchiefs down the fronts of their bodices, smoothing marble-white gloves. And because they were all laughing it seemed to Leila that they were all lovely. <p> " Are n't there any invisible hairpins? " cried a voice. " How most extraordinary! I ca n't see a single invisible hairpin. " <p> " Powder my back, there 's a darling, " cried someone else. <p> " But I must have a needle and cotton. I 've torn simply miles and miles of the frill, " wailed a third. <p> Then, " Pass them along, pass them along! " The straw basket of programs was tossed from arm to arm. Darling little pink-and-silver programs, with pink pencils and fluffy, tassels. <p> Leila 's fingers shook as she took one out of the basket. She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two, Two in a Canoe. Polka 4. Making the Feathers Fly, " when Meg cried, " Ready, Leila? " and they pressed their way through the crush in the passage towards the big double doors of the drill hall. <p> Dancing had not begun yet, but the band had stopped tuning, and the noise was so great it seemed that when it did begin to play it would never be heard. Leila, pressing close to Meg, looking over Meg 's shoulder, felt that even the little quivering colored flags strung across the ceiling were talking. She quite forgot to be shy ; she forgot how in the middle of dressing she had sat down on the bed with one shoe off and one shoe on and begged her mother to ring up her cousins and say she could n't go after all. And the rush of longing she had had to be sitting on the veranda of their forsaken upcountry home, listening to the baby owls crying " More pork " in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet that it was hard to bear alone. She clutched her fan, and gazing at the gleaming, golden floor, the azaleas, the lanterns, the stage at one end with its red carpet and gilt chairs and the band in a corner, she thought breathlessly ; " How heavenly ; how simply heavenly! " <p> All the girls stood grouped together at one side of the doors, the men at the other, and the chaperones in dark dresses, smiling rather foolishly, walked with little careful steps over the polished floor towards the stage. <p> " This is my little country cousin Leila. Be nice to her. Find her partners ; she 's under my wing, " said Meg, going up to one girl after another. <p> Strange faces smiled at Leila -- sweetly, vaguely. Strange voices answered, " Of course, my dear. " But Leila felt the girls did n't really see her. They were looking towards the men. Why did n't the men begin? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothing their gloves, patting their glossy hair and smiling among themselves. Then, quite suddenly, as if they had only just made up their minds that that was what they had to do, the men came gliding over the parquet. There was a joyful flutter among the girls. A tall, fair man flew up to Meg, seized her program, scribbled something ; Meg passed him on to Leila. " May I have the pleasure? " He ducked and smiled. Then quite an old man -- fat, with a big bald patch on his head -- took her program and murmured, " Let me see, let me see! " And he was a long time comparing his program, which looked black with names, with hers. It seemed to give him so much trouble that Leila was ashamed. " Oh, please do n't bother, " she said eagerly. But instead of replying the fat man wrote something, glanced at her again. " Do I remember this bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it known to me of yore? " At that moment the band began playing ; the fat man disappeared. He was tossed away on a great wave of music that came flying over the gleaming floor, breaking the groups up into couples, scattering them, sending them spinning... <p> Leila had learned to dance at boarding school. Every Saturday afternoon the boarders were hurried off to a little corrugated iron mission hall where Miss Eccles( of London) held her " select " classes. But the difference between that dusty-smelling hall -- with calico texts on the walls, the poor terrified little woman in a brown velvet toque with rabbit 's ears thumping the cold piano, Miss Eccles poking the girls ' feet with her long white wand -- and this was so tremendous that Leila was sure if her partner did n't come and she had to listen to that marvelous music and to watch the others sliding, gliding over the golden floor, she would die at least, or faint, or lift her arms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stars. <p> " Ours, I think -- " Someone bowed, smiled, and offered her his arm ; she had n't to die after all. Someone 's hand pressed her waist, and she floated away like a flower that is tossed into a pool. <p> " Quite a good floor, is n't it? " drawled a faint voice close to her ear. <p> " I think it 's most beautifully slipper? " said Leila. <p> " Pardon! " The faint voice sounded surprised. Leila said it again. And there was a tiny pause before the voice echoed, " Oh, quite! " and she was swung round again. <p> He steered so beautifully. That was the great difference between dancing with girls and men, Leila decided. Girls banged into each other, and stamped on each other 's feet ; the girl who was gentleman always clutched you so. <p> The azaleas were separate flowers no longer ; they were pink and white flags streaming by. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the voice came again. It sounded tired. <p> " No, this is my first dance, " said she. Her partner gave a little gasping laugh. " Oh, I say, " he protested. <p> " Yes, it is really the first dance I 've ever been to. " Leila was most fervent. It was such a relief to be able to tell somebody. " You see, I 've lived in the country all my life up until now... <p> At that moment the music stopped, and they went to sit on two chairs against the wall. Leila blissfully watched the other couples passing and disappearing through the swing doors. <p> " Enjoying yourself, Leila? " asked Jose, nodding her golden head. <p> Laura passed and gave her the faintest little wink ; it made Leila wonder for a moment whether she was quite grown up after all. Certainly her partner did not say very much. He coughed, tucked his handkerchief away, pulled down his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it did n't matter. Almost immediately the band started, and her second partner seemed to spring from the ceiling. <p> " Floor 's not bad, " said the new voice. Did one always begin with the floor? And then, " Were you at the Neaves ' on Tuesday? " And again Leila explained. Perhaps it was a little strange that her partners were not more interested. For it was thrilling. <p> Her first ball! She was only at the beginning of everything It seemed to her that she had never known what the night was like before. Up till now it had been dark, silent, beautiful very often -- oh, yes -- but mournful somehow. Solemn. And now it would never be like that again -- it had opened dazzling bright. <p> " Care for an ice? " said her partner. And they went through the swing doors, down the passage, to the supper room. How sweet the ices looked on little glass plates, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! And when they came back to the hall there was the fat man waiting for her by the door. It gave her quite a shock again to see how old he was ; he ought to have been on the stage with the fathers and mothers. And when Leila compared him with her other partners he looked shabby. His waistcoat was creased, there was a button off his glove, his coat looked as if it was dusty with French chalk. <p> " Come along, little lady, it was more like walking than dancing. But he said not a word about the floor. " Your first dance, is n't it? " he murmured. <p> " How did you know? " <p> " Ah, " said the fat man, " that 's what it is to be old! " He wheezed faintly as he steered her past an awkward couple. " You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last thirty years. " <p> " Thirty years? " cried Leila. Twelve years before she was born! <p> " It hardly bears thinking about, does it? " said the fat man gloomily. Leila looked at his bald head, and she felt quite sorry for him. <p> " I think it 's marvelous to be still going on, " she said kindly. <p> " Kind little lady, " said the fat man, and he pressed her a little closer. " Of course, " he said, " you ca n't hope to last anything like as long as that. No-o, " said the fat man, " long before that you 'll be sitting up there on the stage, looking on, in your nice black velvet. And these pretty arms will have turned into little short fat ones and you 'll beat time with such a different kind of fan -- a black bony one. " The fat man seemed to shudder. " And you 'll smile away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your daughter, and tell the elderly lady next to you how some dreadful man tried to kiss her at the club ball. And your heart will ache, ache " -- the fat man squeezed her closer still, as if he really was sorry for that poor heart -- " because no one wants to kiss you now. And you 'll say how unpleasant these polished floors are to walk on, how dangerous they are. Eh, Mademoiselle Twinkletoes? ' said the fat man softly. <p> Leila gave a light little laugh, but she did not feel like laughing. Was it-could it all be true? It sounded terribly true. Was this first hail only the beginning of her last ball after all? At that the music seemed to change ; it sounded sad, sad ; it rose upon a great sigh. Oh, how quickly things changed! Why did n't happiness last forever? Forever was n't a bit too long. <p> " I want to stop, " she said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door. <p> " No, " she said, " I wo n't go outside. I wo n't sit down. I 'll just stand here, thank you. " She leaned against the wall, tapping with her foot, pulling up her gloves and trying to smile. But deep inside her a little girl threw her pinafore over her head and sobbed. Why had he spoiled it all? <p> " I say, you know, " said the fat man, " you must n't take me seriously, little lady. " <p> " As if I should! " said Leila, tossing her small dark head and sucking her underlip.... <p> Again the couples paraded. The swing doors opened and shut. Now new, music was given out by the bandmaster. But Leila did n't want to dance any more. She wanted to be home, or sitting on the veranda listening to those baby owls. When she looked through the dark windows at the stars, they had long beams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, ravishing tune began, and a young man with curly hair bowed before her. She would have to dance, out of politeness, until she could find Meg. Very stiffly she walked into the middle ; very haughtily she put her hand on his sleeve. But in one minute, in one turn, her feet glided, glided. The lights, the azaleas, the dresses, the pink faces, the velvet chairs, all became one beautiful flying wheel. And when her next partner bumped her into the fat man and he said, " Pardon, " she smiled at him more radiantly than ever. She did n't even recognize him again. <p> Date of publication : 1922 <p> Protagonist : Leila, 18 <p> Precipitating event : she moves to the city and attends her first ball <p> Central conflict : can a girl still have fun once she gains the awareness of her own mortality? <p> Category : disillusionment <p> <p> By Katherine Mansfield <p>
