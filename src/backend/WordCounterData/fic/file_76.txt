1011441 WHEN THE ICE VEIN BLED dry at its capillary end, the rockers brought in their big equipment to bust it open for use as another farm tunnel. Their big equipment consisted of secondhand castoffs and other junk from the outer satellites, so Broadnax was n't surprised when the borer broke down again, grinding work to a halt. <p> While the rest of the crew disassembled the motor, he turned uptunnel toward the airlock. This deep inside Troilus the spin-gravity was less than a third gee. Realizing that he moved opposite the asteroid 's spin, he sprinted and launched himself over some tools blocking the tunnel floor. He folded his arms and floated for a moment, suspended in midair. <p> An appreciative whistle sounded over the com, followed by a young woman 's buoyant voice. " Showoff. " <p> He opened his arms and legs to land but miscalculated his position and touched a wall. The contact tumbled him hard to his knees. The woman laughed at him. " You all right? " <p> " Yeah, " he said as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own inability to resist stupid temptations. <p> Sue-sheila Andy grinned back at him. She was a few good years past puberty, wasp-waisted, still a little bony where she needed curves. New to the tunnel crew - she 'd been running the centrifuge, taking care of chicks down in the hatchery before. She was supposed to be sealing the walls, but it was pretty clear that task bored her. That was her equipment he 'd jumped. Judging from the way she was closing a locker, she 'd been playing games or doing something else instead. Would n't be too long before she wanted to have a baby, he guessed. She seemed like that type. Eager to be growing up, to be doing something - anything - new. He 'd been there. <p> " So what do we have? " She tipped her helmet toward the end of the tube where the borer sat idle. <p> He glanced over his shoulder. " Looks like we have a really big hammer. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She laughed a second time, stopped, then tilted her head again. " Do you think it 's the ghost? " <p> Raymont McAfee, another one of the rockers, had been crushed to death a week before, pinned between the borer and the wall when a mooring broke. Took him a while to die. All the little breakdowns since then had been blamed on his ghost tinkering with the equipment. <p> " That borer 's old and buggy, " Broadnax said. He 'd been at McAfee 's side while he died and had n't been able to do anything to help him. " Does n't mean there 's a ghost. " <p> " Maybe, " she said. " Have they burned him yet? " <p> Rockers burned their dead and scattered the ashes in space. It was bad luck having uneasy souls around an asteroid. <p> " Yeah. " Broadnax really did n't want to talk about it. He held up his hands to show the dumb-gloves, though she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Listen, can you tell me what the food stock looks like? With another delay? " <p> As she tapped out the request on her palm, a graph flashed into brief existence on her monocle. " Still holding at eighty-eight percent of sustenance. At least until the ship arrives. " <p> Which was three months off, when their orbit intersected the Martian transports. If they came. The transports had n't come on the last go-round, which was the source of the rockers ' current troubles. <p> " Is that with McAfee 's portion divided? " he asked. <p> " Sure. But divided over seven hundred people - " <p> It was more than that, 732, almost five percent more : Broadnax frowned at the down-rounding. <p> " - it 's only a few more beans in every bowl of soup. " <p> " You do n't want your beans, I 'll take ' em. " <p> Her smile flashed as if he were joking. She hesitated, then raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bent toward him. She had something she wanted to say off-com, even if nobody else was listening in on their channel. <p> He stepped closer and she leaned up until their faceplates kissed. Strands of thick black hair were plastered on her cheek. She licked her lips. <p> " Hey, it 's my turn to have the new vivid - " <p> " That historical one? " <p> " Yeah, that one. About Earth, sunside, but with air. You want to come by and watch it with my family later? " Her courage all used up, she dropped her eyes and her voice faltered. " I mean if you have n't seen it - " <p> " I have n't seen it. " <p> When she released a quick little sigh of relief, he smiled for her. She really was very pretty. <p> " Hey. " He had an impulse. " I 'm scheduled to take the shuttle out for the garbage dump shift after this. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer. " <p> The overhead lights gleamed in her dark, uncertain eyes. <p> " You see what I 'm saying? " <p> " I guess, " she said. <p> " Well. You got anywhere else you 're supposed to be? " <p> Her head twitched back, but not enough to break the contact between the helmets. <p> " Oh, do n't worry about it. " He stepped back and spoke over the public channel. " Maybe I 'll come by to watch the vivid. " <p> She reached for his arm and he paused. The helmets clicked like teeth as they touched again - some atmosphere leaked into the tunnel, a few millibars to check for seepage, enough for sound to travel. " So if I wanted to meet you -? " <p> " At the shuttle. If you wanted. " <p> " Maybe I do. When did you say? " <p> " Next shift at thirteen hours. " <p> She bit her lip. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nah, " he said, yanking a sonic hammer out of the tool locker. He mimed busting out a few chunks of rock around the borer. " But I 'm glad I found it. " <p> He turned and headed back down tunnel, hammer swinging at the end of his arm. <p> " That 's not going to do much good, " she said over the com, a little bounce back in her voice. <p> He did n't look back. " Some good is better than none. " <p> BACK IN HIS DARKENED quarters a few hours later, Broadnax lay sore and exhausted with his baby daughter Maya snuggled in the pouch on his chest. Her fist pressed against her mouth. Only a few months old, she weighed less than the sonic hammer but felt so much heavier. A greenish stain marked Broadnax 's shirt where she 'd spit up most of her daily allowance plus the twelve percent made up out of his own share. <p> He leaned forward and rubbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her formula. The soft texture of her tiny black curls brushed the back of his good hand, the left one. She grunted and stirred, so he nudged the wall to rock the hammock. The motion soothed her. And him. He did n't think he 'd been sleeping until the door slammed opened and the lights shot up. <p> " Hell, " muttered an exhausted voice, directed at nothing in particular - Kayla, his wife, in from sunside. She saw him and dimmed the lights again. <p> " What 's wrong? " Broadnax asked. <p> " What 's right? " She stripped to her underwear, balling up her pants and hurling them in the corner. Even in the shadows, she looked as thin and tough as carbon-fiber cable. She was a few years older than Sue-sheila, a few years younger than Broadnax. " The solar scoops are all working again, but we had to rebuild one of the stabilizers. Not sure how long it 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " he said, nuzzling his daughter 's tiny head again. The lights had n't bothered her. " Any word from Aeneas? " <p> " Yeah, we fixed the dish too, first thing. I forgot. They lost their goat pharm last year - " <p> " ' Lost, ' " Broadnax muttered, disbelieving. <p> " - and want to trade us for antibiotics. Apparently they 've got some new infection going around. " <p> " What 're they offering? " <p> " Algae, lemons, basic stuff. " She washed her face and arms while they talked, wetting a rag at the kitchen tap - the bathroom they shared was down-tunnel. <p> " It 's not worth it, " he said. " The goats do n't have milk right now anyway because their rations were cut way back. Bet it 'd take more to get them to produce than we 'd get in trade. " <p> " Yeah, but we 'll have to do it if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more specifics. " <p> She toweled off with her dirty shirt, tossed it down too, and glided over to the hammock. As she bent over, Broadnax lifted his head up to meet her. She leaned past him to kiss the baby. Lips pursed, she blew him a kiss as she stood up. <p> " I need to sleep, " she said, shooting over to the bedroom door and yanking it open. <p> He twisted a second too late. " Wait - " <p> A voice yelled in the other room. <p> Kayla slammed the door and Maya jerked awake, big eyes darting around. <p> Broadnax spoke softly as he rubbed his daughter 's back. " Trey Robinson needed a place to crash while we 're finishing the repairs to Droop Tunnel. We were coming up on the quarters rotation, so I - " <p> " No, it 's okay, " she said, exhaling. She cracked the door. " Sorry ' bout that, Trey. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did n't mean to startle you. " <p> " Neither did I, " she said, closing the door. <p> " I stayed out here so I could tell you when you came in, " Broadnax said. " Instead of you walking right in on him sleeping in the hammock. Guess I fell asleep. " <p> She plopped down cross-legged and leaned against the wall beside the ceiling-high tomato plant. " It 's okay. It 'll get better soon. The Evanses are packing up, all of them, and flying for Callisto when it comes out from behind. " <p> " Things ai n't no better on Callisto. " <p> " Ca n't tell her that. Anyway, it 'll give us a little more room to squeeze by until the transports come. " <p> If they came. Broadnax did n't say that, though. <p> She was picking through the plant for a nearly ripe tomato they 'd been watching for a couple days. Her shoulders knotted. " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he had n't told Trey not to either. Still, that was a dustsucker thing for Trey to do and he 'd have to settle it with him later. " Sorry. There 's another one 'll be ripe in a day or two, if you look down there on the left. " <p> " Yeah, I see it. " Her head sagged. <p> He slid out of the hammock onto the floor. Maya 's tiny hand pinched the skin of his throat as she held on tight. " Here you go, " he said, patting the cushions. <p> Kayla climbed inside and rolled herself up in the blankets without talking to him, then buried her face in the pillow and pretended to be asleep. Maybe she already was. She 'd been tired constantly ever since having the baby. But things had been rough between them before that. Had always been rough. <p> Maya sucked greedily on her thumb while Broadnax held her tight to his big shoulder, rocking her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long insulated berm terminal with dozens of flextube airlocks staggered up one side. Broadnax arrived early to load and check his shuttle, then came back out to the corridor to wait. <p> Huge fans rattled overhead, stirring the thin air and making him uncomfortable. Laughter echoed at the far end as a crew of Kayla 's coworkers came in from sunside maintenance and hurried downshaft. He could n't blame them. If the spin-gravity was low down deep, up here it was gee plus. But that was n't the only thing weighing on him. <p> He had just about decided to make the run alone when Sue-sheila hopped off the lift, glanced around to see if anyone saw her, then hurried over to his side. <p> She wore her usual clothes, blues and grays, nothing special Broadnax noticed about them. But she had scrubbed her skin until it gleamed and had glossed her lips with something. Even her computer monocle looked a little less dingy than normal. <p> " You look nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face to see if he was mocking her ; words faltered on her pretty mouth. " I - " <p> " No, you do. " He indicated the flextube. " Let 's go. <p> She brushed against him on her way into the tube, and he caught his breath at her touch. Picking up a last canister, he followed her. The tube sagged under his weight. <p> He entered the craft, sphinctered the airlock shut, and hit the keys that undid the clamps. Sue-sheila waited nervously in the cramped middeck behind the seats. <p> " You want payload or pilot? " he asked. <p> " Payload, " she said quickly. He gestured for her to take the seat slightly back and to the left. He ducked his head and squeezed into the right seat, loosely tucking the canister under the strap beside him. <p> " You read the checklist, " he said. She did n't know where to find it, so he showed her how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked, voice wavering. <p> " Exchanged. " <p> " Fuel cells? " <p> " Purged. " <p> " Inertial measurement unit? " <p> He answered her all the way down the list, checking his own calculations again at the same time and setting everything for launch. When she came to the end, he said, " You forgot to ask about food rations. " <p> Her face registered confusion, flashed fear, whipped back to the list. " But it 's not on here. " <p> " Never is, but you always ask. " <p> " But we 're only flying out for - " Her voice was rising in protest. <p> " You always ask, " he repeated firmly. <p> She slouched in her chair. " Okay, then - got any food rations? " <p> " Enough for a couple days, " he said, " long as we do n't eat anything. " He leaned back to catch her eye and share a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Look, it 's not on the list because you can answer no and still take off, depending on where you 're flying to. But you always ask. That 's something you need to know. " <p> " Oh. " <p> He commenced the launch sequence, counting down the final seconds aloud the way he learned as a kid. " Ten rings of Saturn, nine rings of Saturn, eight rings - " <p> " I did n't sign out, " she said. " Did you sign us out? " <p> He watched the rest of the ticks click away. The thrusters boosted and they lifted off. " Well, if I did that they might look for us back at a certain time, " he said. " Did you tell anyone where you were going? " <p> " No. " <p> " I did n't tell anyone where you were going either. " <p> She wiped her palms on her thighs and smiled at him, a little nervously. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deliberately, setting an example for her. Troilus dropped below them, the sunburned boulders poking up brown through the gray regolith. They flew over Buckshot Crater - Broadnax always thought that was a stupid name, since it was a smooth circular plain covered with a lot of tiny craters -then they were up and away from the surface completely. He turned the shuttle as they boosted and they glimpsed the solar scoops spread out like the petals of a flower, spinning the asteroid like a pinwheel in the starspangled sky. His stomach hiphopped with the shift to weightlessness. <p> Sue-sheila pressed against the bugeye window, staring. When she noticed Broadnax noticing her, she leaned back in her seat and feigned boredom. <p> " How you like tunnel busting so far? " he asked. <p> " Oh, it 's better than the hatchery. " <p> " Uh-huh, " he said encouragingly. <p> " They let me pick out the new rooster, just before I left. " She leaned forward, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that 's what roosters are called? Cocks. " <p> " Uh-huh. " <p> " So I got to pick the new cock. " <p> After a bit of silence while he finished setting in their course, he said, " Tough choice? " <p> She stared at him waiting for more of a reaction, then leaned back in her seat and acted bored again. " Nah. We have to do it after so many generations just to keep genetic diversity in the fertile eggs. So we tested a bunch, found some males, and I picked one. " <p> " You have any practice flying one of these? " he asked. <p> " Yeah! " She snapped upright. " I mean, on the simulator. " <p> " Take the console, " he told her, flipping the controls over to the payload seat 's joystick. " Simulator 's more interesting. Stuff goes wrong there. " <p> The shuttle 's computer compensated for normal course deviations at regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, making constant awkward little adjustments to keep them tightly on course. He let her do it for a while, answering her questions about reading the charts, and watching her attention focus on it until she grew frustrated. <p> " How come -? " She made a fist and punched her seat. <p> " Look, just enter the coordinates and let it go, " he said, switching the controls back to his seat and taking his hand off the joystick. " Like this. Computer makes the minor course adjustments on its own. You do n't really need to do anything unless you change the destination. " <p> " But in the simulator - " <p> " Yeah, I know, but we burn real fuel, okay? " <p> " Okay. " She pouted as if he should have told her that instead of letting her learn it for herself. Her head turned. " What 's that? " <p> The canister Broadnax brought aboard was floating loose in the zero gee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Sue-sheila grabbed it out of the air. <p> He paused a moment before deciding to answer. " McAfee. " <p> " What? " She shoved it away. " You mean, his ashes? " <p> " Yeah. Or maybe his ghost that 's been busting up the equipment. " He caught the canister and wedged it tighter between the bolts and belt knobs of his seat before strapping it down again. <p> " I thought he was your friend. " <p> " He was a hard guy to get along with, " Broadnax said. <p> " The two of you went all the way to Mars once, did n't you? " <p> " Three of us. Me, McAfee, and Seema Gamble. " <p> " Oh, I remember her. What happened to her? " <p> Broadnax scrolled over the local space maps, slotting in his own chips to make some comparisons. Sue-sheila adjusted her breasts in her shirt and stretched her collar a bit. He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice either. " She decided not to come back, " he said finally. <p> " Who can blame her? " Sue-sheila laughed at the idea. " Would n't you go there again? " <p> " It was hard there. Domes with thousands and thousands of people, no way to know them all, strangers always looking to rob you. No crew to work with where everybody shares alike, always somebody telling you what to do and how to do it. " That thought seemed to sober her up a bit. He considered mentioning the way Seema had gotten hooked on dust. The back of his hand rubbed across his dry mouth. " But yeah, she stayed there. " <p> She tipped her nose at his right arm. The synth-skin was silver right up to the elbow where it blended into his own dark arm. " Why did n't you get that pigmented? " she asked. <p> " Did n't seem important. " He 'd lost the arm six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had killed McAfee. It still did n't feel quite like his own arm. The hand held onto things too tightly, though he 'd had the neural connectors checked and rechecked and recalibrated them every few shifts to acquire new muscle memory. " Besides, " he added, " I would have had to wait a couple extra days for the match and the crew was already running short. It 's nothing, just skin. " <p> " My mom took me to Callisto one time, when Ashvinni " - her little brother - " was sick. " <p> Broadnax remembered that. She 'd been about ten years old. Her brother did work down in the hydroponics farms now, mostly running the scummers. <p> " We saw a guy there who 'd hurt both his legs in an explosive decompression accident. He was in the clinic with my brother. Both his legs were all, you know, black - " <p> " Necrotic? " <p> " - yeah, whatever, but more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in vacuum and his suit ruptured and the auto-clamps tourniquetted - " Broadnax frowned. <p> " - his legs to save him. They were pretty tore up anyway, from the same thing that ripped his suit. They gave him two new legs but they had a hard time matching his skin color. He had this weird pale pinkish skin. " <p> " Uh-huh, " he said. " Like Kangas? " Kangas was a guy who kept to himself, worked mostly in vent systems. <p> " Yeah! Like him, pink like that. Anyway the silver kept showing through. " <p> " Huh. I hate tourniquet suits. " <p> " That what happened to your arm? I thought it got crushed. " She reached out to touch his arm. <p> Broadnax tensed. She pulled her hand back. <p> " Yeah, the borer crushed it, " he said. " Anyway, that 's why I do n't believe in no ghost. We had stuff breaking down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " <p> A little line folded in the middle of her forehead. " I thought this was going to be fun. But sometimes you 're as cold as rock. " <p> He turned his face away from her and mumbled, " I can get pretty hot too sometimes. " <p> She slouched in her seat and sulked at him with her glistening lower lip thrust out. He did n't say another thing to her until they reached the dropoff point. Troilus 's garbage was all the stuff that could n't be recycled : heavy metals, radioactives, contaminated organics. Not much, a load every few months. He 'd volunteered for the trash run just like he offered to take care of McAfee 's remains. He unbelted himself, popped one of the suction cup handholds off the wall, and pushed over to the little middeck area that opened behind the seats. <p> She twisted around to look at him. " You want the canister? " <p> " No. McAfee could be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Applying the suction cup to the wall for leverage, he pulled open the shuttle 's sleeping bunk, a hammock stretched in front of the locker wall. The trash was stored in a body-ball, the kind they used for life-rafts, decompression accidents, that sort of thing. Too big to fit in the lockers. They used a damaged one, with disabled life support, for the trash. Broadnax checked that the contamination lights were on, the " do not pick up " beacon was beeping, and the telemetry broadcasting " tomb " instead of " womb. " Then he rolled it into the little airlock. His ears popped when he vacuumed the pressure back into the cabin. He left just enough in the lock to give the trash some outward momentum, then sphinctered the outer hull open. An alarm beeped. <p> " What 'll happen to that? " Sue-sheila asked. <p> " If I got the coordinates right, it 'll eventually drop into Jupiter 's atmosphere. That bad boy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh. " <p> He retrieved the canister, took a roll of the heavy tape out of a locker, and opened the airlock. He attached the can to the floor - no need letting something that valuable go - then flipped open the lid so McAfee 's remains could scatter. <p> Sue-sheila cringed as he closed the lock again and cycled most of the air out. " Wo n't his ashes just follow us back home? " <p> " Yeah, some of ' em, maybe, " Broadnax said. " But the dead always follow you around, ca n't do much about it. " <p> He opened the other side of the lock and said his silent farewell to McAfee. That was all there was to it. No ceremony, at least no more than a few of them had in the common room a couple shifts back. He sighed as he slid back into his seat and brought up the course settings. He entered the new coordinates from his own charts and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum thrust. <p> " Guess we 'll loop out past some other gravity wells before heading home, see if we ca n't lose him, " he said. <p> " Where are we going? " Her voice wavered. She did n't look as pretty to him anymore. Too young, too much like Seema. <p> " Somewhere. " <p> " I want to go back. " <p> " What? " His voice sounded a lot angrier, more raw, than he intended. " You go climbing in a shuttle with some guy, do n't hardly even know him, do n't tell anyone where you are, and then think you can just change your mind? " <p> Her dark brown eyes widened, and her hands curled like claws. " Do n't touch me. " <p> " I ai n't touching you, " he snapped. " But the next guy might not give you no choice. You hear what that group of dustsuckers from Patroclus did to Annie-pamela Nundy? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, curled her shoulders in, and scowled. " Who are you, anyway, my mom? That 's like ancient history and anyway I did n't get in a shuttle with them. " <p> He stared at the readings. They were heading off into a section of the belt where a lot of the minor bodies had n't ever been properly charted, so he was setting up scans to add the data into his own charts. He double-checked the firewalls to make sure none of it leaked over into common memory. <p> " Listen, " he said after a long while, his voice calmer. " I can tell that Troilus is too small for you. You want something else, you do n't even know what, and someday you 're going to get in a ship, anybody 's ship, and fly off to Callisto or Titan or Mars or anywhere else at all just because you 're bored, just because you have to get off this rock. " <p> " God, whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, do n't believe me. Forget I said anything about it. " He did n't like the look of things outside. They were n't matching up with where he expected things to be. " But today you got in a shuttle with me, and now we 're going to go someplace and when we get there, you 're going to do exactly what I say. " <p> " You ca n't make me do anything, " she said. <p> She looked scared. He hoped she was. <p> " You think you 're all grown up, " he said, " you better start making some more grown-up decisions. " He leaned his seat back as far as it would go and jerked his thumb toward the middeck. " You 'll be better off sleeping in the bunk if you want to rest. " <p> She glowered at him, seething anger. But she stayed in her seat. He closed his eyes while she burned it out of her system. <p> She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she watched everything he did and he made sure he did everything in the open where she could watch him. All the tasks were things she should have known from the simulator. <p> The Trojan asteroid fields contained hundreds of planetismals, some of them, like Troilus, home to colonies ; most of the field was mapped out in a general way, but there were plenty of small asteroids too little to take notice of. Some were no bigger than dust, some were a few kilometers in diameter. He breathed easier another hour later when one of the latter appeared in the forward porthole, an oblong star that grew brighter and brighter. He burst the brake thrusters to start decelerating. <p> He inventoried the med cabinet, double-checked all the control settings, and watched the clock. When the timer he 'd set went off, he pulled down an oxygen mask, flipped the switches, and started breathing pure oxygen. <p> The first words she spoke to him, seeing the O2 mask, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nope. " <p> " Well, I hope you 're breathing poison. " <p> He grinned, liking her a little more again. In a sense, oxygen was poison. He did n't correct her. <p> " You locked me out of all the control systems, " she said. <p> " Yeah, I did. " <p> A little while later, she asked, " Where are we? " <p> He nodded at the speck of light ahead of them. " Almost where we 're going. " <p> Leaving the mask on his face, Broadnax unstrapped from the pilot 's seat. Hooking his feet in the floor loops, he grabbed hold of the bands on the ceiling and began a set of vigorous crunches while controlling his breathing, checking his oxygenation. <p> " Uh, what are you doing now? " she asked. <p> " Warming up to rockwalk. " <p> " What? " She shook her head. " You ca n't make me go outside. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tricky. I need someone inside. Just in case. " <p> " In case of what? " <p> " In case of nothing. " <p> He finished his crunches, unhooked, and swung into the pilot 's seat. <p> " What 's out here that we do n't have at home? " she asked. <p> Broadnax looped in tight around the asteroid, using its slight mass to help slow them down, saving a little more fuel for the trip back. " There, that 's it. " <p> He hit the forward light and it played over the surface of the rock. Little bumps and craters cast shifting shadows as the light played over them. One shadow jerked opposite the others. <p> " What? " she said. " I do n't see anything but raw rock. " <p> " Tell you what I see : lysine, leucine, methionine - " <p> " Huh? Are you dusted? " <p> " - phenylalanine, valine, tryptophan - " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice was shrill. <p> " Essential amino acids. Protein. But the niacin is a nice little extra. " She still looked at him all puzzled, so he said. " Down there. If you watch close, you might see one moving. " <p> She leaned forward in her seat, then unbelted herself and pressed her face right up against the port glass. <p> " Wow! " she whispered. " It 's, they really are - " <p> " Vacuum seals, yeah. " <p> He squeezed in beside her and tried not to notice the smooth skin of her bare arm pressed against his. His eyes skimmed over the surface below them, picking out the darker oval shapes scattered on the rock. From up here, they were roughly the same color as the radiation-burned boulders on Troilus, only there was no regolith below - not enough gravity. His hand swung the light around while he tried to pick a spot smooth enough to land, close enough to what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " My mom talks about them, " Sue-sheila was saying, " about the beachheads of them on Troilus when they were first cracking the rock open. She said there were some as big as air mattresses. " <p> " Huh, " Broadnax said, flying the joystick left-handed to do one more loop. The rock was n't that big. Maybe two kilometers lengthwise. " Biggest I ever seen anywhere was half that. They collapse when you bring them into any kind of air pressure though, lose maybe a third of their size. " <p> " She says they taste pretty plain - " <p> " Yeah, not much flavor. " <p> " - and the seals are best, but even, what do you call them, the shemps? " <p> " Shrimps. " <p> " Yeah, shrimps, they are n't too bad, if you cook them right, she says. " <p> " There are four sizes, " Broadnax said. " Seals, pups, lobsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the length of their reproduction cycle, so you only see them in stages. Ai n't much to lobsters and shrimps besides shell. But we ate them all. That was all that kept us going those first few years, while we busted open the rock. " <p> He said " we, " but it had been his folks. He 'd been too small to work on the crews then, though there 'd only been about a hundred people and he knew all of them and got to see the work they did. He remembered the shrimps tasting bland, but having an interesting texture. He 'd been old enough to join the seal hunting crews that scoured the surface for the last of them. He and McAfee had worked on that crew together, the first time either one of them spent that much time sunside. <p> Her fingers clicked over her palm and lines of green text and images scrolled over her monocle. <p> " No, seriously. They 're all gone, trailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. She stared out the port in disbelief. " There are n't supposed to be any more. " <p> He knew what she knew, because they linked to the same common memory. " Well, here they are. " <p> " But how? " She was bouncing around almost as much as her voice. <p> He selected a spot to land and guided the ship in. " I was making a run from, " he was going to say Anaeas to Prairiedog, decided not to, " one place to another a couple years back along the usual route and decided about halfway there to go home instead. I rock-skipped my way through this sector and stumbled across this then. " <p> " But it 's not in my memory! " she said, staring at text, fingers jumping like mad. <p> " If I had n't kept it to myself, they would n't be here now. You learn to keep some things to yourself if you want to make it, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 'd reached the end of the information available on the seals and was already frustrated. " Do you think they were always here, maybe? " <p> " Du n no, " he said. " They 've found some traces of some kind of life pretty much everywhere in the solar system except Mercury and Pluto. " He picked the exact spot to land, nudged the brake thrusters again. " And nobody 's looked too hard at either of those. " <p> " Well, it says here they 're probably genetically engineered from the anaerobic Martian roaches, the ones sent out ahead of the colonists, before the terraforming. But nobody 's sure. " <p> " Did you know they were called cockroaches? " <p> She did, but he knew she did because he 'd read it too. She blushed, which made him smile. <p> " Cockroaches, " he repeated, emphasizing the word just the way she had when she was talking about the roosters. <p> " Seems like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said, blushing even more and acting like he had n't said anything. " Probably seeded through the asteroid belt ahead of settlement. " <p> " Well, settlement happened and they 're pretty much extinct now. " He touched the surface so lightly when he landed that she did n't even notice. <p> " Takes over a hundred years for them to grow to full - " <p> The whump of the anchor bolt firing into the rock surprised her into silence and she looked through her monocle at him. <p> " You do n't have to come out there with me, " he said. " Just stay in here, talk to me over the radio, answer any questions I have. " He showed her the buttons. " I 'm unlocking the controls now. If you decide to leave without me, this is how you retract the anchor. " <p> She stared at him while he swung by the suction cups over to the lockers. <p> " I 'm not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lightweight suit, the thin one that they used for tunnel construction. It was quicker to put on and he 'd take his chances with micrometeor tears and radiation - he was n't going to be out there very long and he wanted maneuverability. Besides, he did n't like using the heavyweight gloves with his new hand yet. He had to fight the built-in servos too much. <p> She stared at him, her eyes almost as wide as when she 'd first seen the seals. " You ca n't leave me - " <p> He snapped his helmet shut, muffling her voice. <p> " - here all by myself. " Her elbows were in tight to her sides and her hands were fists. <p> " I 'll be outside if you need me, " he said. He grabbed a workbag full of clips, a hand drill, and a light as he stepped into the airlock over the empty canister. As he cycled the door shut, one of McAfee 's ashes appeared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead step. Broadnax 's ears popped. <p> " You hear me? " he said over the radio. <p> " Yes, " came the sullen reply. " I hate you! " <p> It clicked off. <p> She 'd get over it. He 'd make it up to her on the return flight. The lock opened and he stepped outside. <p> The shuttle 's light flooded a sheet of white across the uneven rock. Every bump in the surface cast a shadow that went on forever. Rockwalking an asteroid this size, Broadnax knew it was a mistake to orient yourself as if there was a down : you had to treat a rock this small as if it was all wall. So instead of hopping down to the surface, and possibly skipping right off it into space, Broadnax swung out and grabbed the shuttle 's handholds, pulling himself over the roof to reach the carbon-fiber towing cable. He attached the end-clip to his belt, unlocked the reel, and pulled to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " he said over the radio. <p> No reply. <p> " Heading out now, " he said. <p> He lowered himself to the surface and then sprawled out on it flat. Next to the shuttle, it gave him the odd sensation of crawling on the floor. With only a hundred fifty meters of tether, he needed to choose his direction carefully to get this done in one trip. Ahead of him and to the left, there was a bigger beachhead of seals. Although that beachhead was all sizes - seals, pups, lobsters - on the flyover, he 'd seen more of the larger ones up and to the left, so he pulled himself hand over hand across the pitted stone in that direction. <p> " Coming up on the first beachhead, " he said. <p> He glanced back to see how far he 'd come, and the floor he 'd been crawling across vertigoed into a wall with the shuttle a twenty-meter drop straight below him. Stupidly, he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danced before his eyes as he squeezed them shut and turned away. <p> When he opened them again, he scanned the surface, trying to count the seals. Their dark backs gleamed black, shot with muted shades of red and brown and dull orange. Probably xanthophyll. They converted solar radiation into mass, while their weird undersurface of tiny double-chambered mouths took up minerals and raw carbons from the stones. According to common memory, they were only found in places with a deep regolith, but that obviously was n't the case here. The world was full of surprises that way. <p> He did n't see any of the seals nearby, only pups. He picked out the biggest one along the edge and pulled himself toward it, reaching it sooner than <p> " Hell! " <p> Sue-sheila did n't answer, and he did n't know if she was still listening, but he explained anyway. <p> " I had the scale all wrong. No way to tell. It was hard to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regolith for them. The ones I thought were seals are only pups. And this pup is a lobster. " <p> And the ones he thought were lobsters were only shrimps. Pretty new ones at that. Not much meat here. He 'd have to work hard to make it worth the trip. Now that he had the scale of things, he scanned the surface, looking for anything with any size at all. The lobsters lay there mostly inert as he clambered over them to reach the nearest pup. <p> Taking the drill in his right hand, he punched a hole in the ridge of the carapace. The creature shivered slightly at the vibration. He fetched a clip from the bag, slipped it through the new hole, and attached it to the cable behind him. <p> " Okay, " he said. " Got the first one. " <p> Still no answer. She probably had turned the radio off in a fit of peeve. He crawled upwall to the next one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two. " <p> He bypassed a bunch of lobsters and a small pup. He was out about sixty meters now already, but getting into the thick of them. The third one he drilled, he started the hole too low on the ridge and punctured the shell - he could tell when it pushed through without showing on the other side. He knew what was coming and flinched as he jerked the drill back. <p> The pup shrank by about a third of its size, and then, with its legs still kicking, folded inside out, vaporing its guts into the void. <p> What a waste. But no time to think about it. <p> On to the next one. He was sweating now ; some had pooled in the nape of his neck, where it floated in the weightlessness, making him want to look over his shoulder constantly, as though someone were watching him. He drilled more carefully this time. <p> " Three. " <p> He settled into a rhythm. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clip. His own body blocked the ship 's light now so that anything in front of him was in darkness. The lightweight suit did n't have a clamp to fix the handlight to, and he soon discovered that he could n't hold onto the handlight, the drill, and the surface at the same time. He slipped the handlight in his hip bag while he worked, casting a net of shadows over everything it illuminated. <p> Crawl, drill, clip, search with the light, crawl, drill, clip. He finished that beachhead, saw he had fifty meters of cable left, and searched several minutes before selecting another direction. <p> There was still no answer from Sue-sheila, so he did n't ask her for help, just replayed the vid from the flyover on his faceplate and tried to guess where he was. When he finally picked a direction, he continued counting out loud for her. <p> " Sixteen. " <p> " Twenty-seven. " <p> He was running low on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark now. He looked back to locate the ship and saw only the long cable with its string of pups looping over the curved horizon. It did n't worry him - all he had to do was push off from the surface and rise into the night until he saw the ship, then pull himself in. But it made him notice the vast sea of space around him, and he thought about those transports from Mars that might or might not come again, and his daughter Maya, and Kayla 's tomato plant. And he saw the cable again, all pups and not a single seal. <p> He turned back to his work, picking the pups more carefully, going a little further for the ones that appeared larger, until he had taken the cable out near its end. He was down to his last clip when he saw the seal. Seals. Two of them, in a little divot of rock. The second one was as big as an air mattress. <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last two, " he said aloud over the radio. He was panting. " Ca n't see much here, too dark. It 'll take a bit. " <p> Here 's where having a partner up above running the light would 've made things easier. That 's how they 'd done it when they scoured Troilus. It was only two seals though, two he had n't seen on the flyover. He could toss off one of the pups and get them both. <p> Or he could unclip himself, attach the end of the line to the last one, and pull himself back to the ship hand over hand. Every little bit helped. <p> The smaller one was closer, so he crawled over and drilled it first. It took a long time to punch the bit through the shell. The carapace sloped down to an edge in front which they seemed to use to turn over the dust ; this one had never done anything but scrape rock, and it looked sharp. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. When Broadnax clipped it to the cable, and twisted the light around, he saw that the bigger one had moved a meter away. <p> He climbed up to it. <p> " Last one, " he said to the radio. <p> No mistaking the scale of this one - it was almost as long as he was, as big as an air mattress. Moving seemed to have exhausted it. It twitched docilely while he carefully drilled the hole through its ridge. He waited a moment, taking a few deep breaths, fighting his own exhaustion, then reached back with the drill still in his right hand and undipped himself from the tether. <p> The seal lunged, butting against him. <p> He might have shouted something, but he did n't notice, too preoccupied by the way his world flipped again from wall to ceiling. He now dangled by one hand and all the universe gaped between his feet. The tether had slipped from his palm, but he still clutched the drill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, disorienting him, tearing at his grip. <p> The seal hit him again. Fire tore through his arm and the air exploded out of his suit - the sharp edge of its shell had sliced it open. <p> He pounded his right fist into his stomach, just the way every rocker was trained as a toddler, forcing himself to exhale all his air. It gave him maybe forty or fifty extra seconds before he died. He saw the end of the cable and grabbed for it, even though there was no way he could pull himself back to the shuttle in time. He missed. His good arm already felt numb. <p> From the corner of his eye, he saw the seal move on the ceiling above him. His right hand still held tight to the drill. With his thumb pressing the on button, he jammed it into the gap behind the carapace ridge. It held and he pulled himself onto the creature 's back. <p> It did n't like that at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than he 'd ever seen all the seals move in his life. Darkness flickered around the edges of his vision. He had maybe thirty seconds left. <p> The drill broke through, puncturing the shell. <p> The seal turned inside out, spraying a wombfull of shrimp into Broadnax 's chest. The tiny black creatures filled the night around him, hundreds, maybe thousands of them. They were beautiful, some falling back to the rock, others flying weightless off into empty space in search of another rock to populate. One death, but countless new lives. It seemed fitting. <p> The impact had pushed him off the rock. As he lifted his head, he realized that he was n't falling into bottomless space but rising toward a heaven filled with stars. His mouth worked, trying to tell Sue-sheila to get the string of pups back to Troilus to feed the others. He 'd forgotten that the radio did n't work in vacuum, but he kept talking, repeating her name, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone he could remember. One death, many lives. It would be okay. He 'd done some good, all the good he could. <p> Glistening black shrimps rose around him and multiplied in the darkness of the sky, blotting out even the stars, swirling around and around until they became ash. Until they became McAfee 's ashes. <p> The ashes grayed and took on McAfee 's shape, the rounded slouch of his shoulders, his easy grin. <p> " It 's good to see you, " he told Broadnax. <p> " Aw, man, Mac, " Broadnax said, and he wept. <p> McAfee 's ghost reached out and clamped his icy hand over the slash in Broadnax 's forearm, embracing Broadnax the same way he 'd held McAfee at the end, and pulling him up toward the stars, into the center of them, to the Sun, which rose, burning away the blackness, growing until it filled the sky. <p> And Broadnax felt warmed by it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold. <p> The young woman 's voice, insulated, far away. " You stupid, stupid dustsucker, I hate you, I hate you - " <p> Broadnax was in a pressurized body-ball in the mid-deck of the ship beside the airlock. For a split second, he wondered if it was set for tomb or womb. <p> " Did you save -? " his voice croaked. <p> Sue-sheila 's face appeared at the little square window. She had her suit on, mask still up. " Yes, I saved your stupid bones. Barely. " <p> That was n't it. His knuckles bounced against his face. " The seals? " <p> She punched the side of the bag. " Those too. " <p> " Let me out. " He had to check on the string of seals, made sure she 'd secured it right. He had to put the baby 's formula in her bottle. He had to call up McAfee and tell him he was sorry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said. Sighing. Standing back. " Sorry, little rooster. We 're not cracking this egg until I get you home. " <p> He did n't argue, not again, realizing what she 'd done already. Instead, he curled up in the darkness of the ball, pressed the numb fist of his injured hand to his mouth, and thought of nothing at all. <p> Sidebar
