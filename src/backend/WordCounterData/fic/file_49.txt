1007741 There may not be things people were not meant to know-but there are certainly things they 'd rather not know. <p> 2021 My deathday is July 18th. I spent it this year as I have every year for the past ten : at home in bed, with my wife nearby. I ca n't afford a private doctor, and I 've heard too many iatrogenic horror stories to check into the hospital for the day. So I just lay quietly, imagining all of the different ways it could happen. A sudden squeezing pain in my chest? Or maybe a jackhammer headache, announcing a burst blood vessel in my brain. A cold, air-conditioned breeze blew over my face, chilling the sweat on my forehead. Around sundown my legs started to tremble uncontrollably, so I pulled the covers up to my neck. Knowing the day on which I will die, but not the year, sometimes seems worse than knowing nothing at all. When midnight rolled around, I heaved myself up onto the edge of the bed and felt my fear slowly ebbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife, and we celebrated with some cheap champagne. It was one of those sultry nights we occasionally get in Chicago in the summer, but the humid warmth felt oddly comforting. I glanced up at the stars and saw the distortion field of the Chtarri ship slip silently overhead. A dirty finger wiping the dome of the sky, smearing out the stars as it passed in front of them. The Angel of Death, erasing stars, erasing lives. I shook these morbid thoughts from my head. No need to worry for another year. Like most data miners, I got paid strictly on contract, so I was back at my desk early the next morning, looking for work. I pulled up several prospective jobs on my screen, along with my AI 's estimate of the payoff probabilities. Most of these were the usual narrow bell curves, centered on depressingly small amounts of money, but one of them was blank, with a note attached : " Bill, are you still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Bob Field. " I had n't seen Bob since he 'd joined the Chtarri Institute. Odd that he was n't going in-house for the job. And he wanted a face-to-face. But I could n't afford to be picky. The Chtarri Institute huddled among the remains of a defunct particle accelerator out in the western suburbs. Long prairie grass had reclaimed most of the lab, although I could make out the circular scar of the accelerator ring on a slight plateau next to the road. The Institute occupied the central high-rise building, a curved, concrete monolith looming above the Illinois plains like a modern Stonehenge. Bob was still in a meeting when I arrived, so his secretary shunted me into the Visitor 's Center. Photos of the Chtarri ship covered the walls of the cramped room. These must have been taken by unmanned probes, but even from space the distortion field masked the faint reddish blob of the ship. Against one wall, a video about the Chtarri played in an endless loop. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied the photos, but it was a collection of the same recycled facts that I 'd heard dozens of times before : "... seems to be a localized, intense gravitational field, violating General Relativity... ", "... following the disastrous Chinese manned expedition of 2013... " In one photo, the ship resembled a cylinder pinched at the waist ; in another, it looked more like a slightly deformed sphere. "... obviously do not experience time in the conventional way..., "... toward understanding the riddle of the Chtarri. " A computer reconstruction of the true shape of the Chtarri vessel, carved in Lucite, hung suspended from a wire in the center of the room. The contorted model was knotted like something out of a topologist 's nightmare. After ten minutes pondering " the riddle of the Chtarri ", I was ushered into Bob 's office. Bright summer sunlight flooded through a floor-to-ceiling window, illuminating a sparsely-populated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the room to pump my hand. " What have you been up to? " he asked. " Oh, the usual freelance jobs. Lots of work, and not much money. " I studied the name plate on his desk. " I see you 've made it to the exalted position of Assistant Director for Internal Affairs '. " " Indeed I have. And I think I could get you a full-time job out here when you get tired of freelancing. " " You know I do n't much like the Chtarri. " Bob shrugged. " Some people hate the Chtarri and some people worship them. I do n't think either attitude is very reasonable. Let me show you something. " Bob flicked a wall switch, and I heard the familiar words : " Chtar ri chol fung pyon luk chin... " It sounded like a demented version of Korean played at 1/10 speed. " You 've heard the first part of thiswe all have, " Bob said, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 22 minutes. That 's the first thing we heard from the Chtarri ship when they took up orbit twelve years ago. Then they immediately began broadcasting the deathday information in binary, which they 've continued doing, without interruption, for the past twelve years. " Bob turned off the recording. " Thirteen hours of gibberish. That 's the sum total of everything we know about Chtarri, and we 've never been able to decipher it. " " Have you tried playing it backwards? " " Very funny. Actually, we have. As well as every other permutation. Our linguists have spent the past decade knocking their heads against it, with nothing to show for their efforts. And the Chtarri have remained in the exact same orbit, ignoring all of our attempts to communicate. " " Not exactly friendly, are they? " " I 'm not sure that has any meaning when applied to the Chtarri. " Bob strode back to his desk and settled into his chair. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do they broadcast the deathday information? Hell, how do they know the day on which we 're all going to die? And why do they send everyone 's month and day of death, but not the year? Is it because they do n't know the year, or are they just withholding it for some inscrutable reason? I know I 'm going to die on June 22, d, but it does n't do me much good if I do n't know the year " " But you take precautions on your deathday. " " Sure, everyone does, except for the few people who decide that they 'd rather not know their deathday. " Bob drummed his fingers on his desk. " Let's. get down to business. You said you 'd be willing to take this job on a contract basis, so here 's what we 're looking for. We 've had three suicides at the Institute in the past three months. " Actual, or presumed? " " Two actual, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper on his desk. " Leonard Kosnik, Philip Chuang, and jason Krauss. Chuang and Krauss are the actual suicides : both killed playing Russian roulette, apparently simultaneously. The third case is presumed : Kosnik was driving here to work on his deathday and was killed in a car crash. We do n't allow our employees to work on their deathdays, much less encourage it. He must have been crazy to take such a risk. " I found myself nodding. " And what do you need me for? " " Two of the three guys left notes. Not exactly suicide notes, but I need to track down what they mean. The first one was from our crash victim, Kosnik ; it just says " I am you '. The second, from Chuang, is a date his wife found on a scrap of paper in his desk drawer at home : November 12, 2122 '. " " That 's more than a hundred years from now. " " Yes, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these notes means. " " And you want me to find out. " Exactly. " " But why are you going outside of the Institute at all? You must employ hundreds of data miners. " " Slightly fewer than a hundred. The problem is that they all work in S Division, which also employed all three of the suicides. Frankly, I 'm having trouble getting much cooperation from S Division. I think they 're hiding something. I wanted to bring in someone from the outside, someone I could trust. " " S Division? What 's that? " " Statistical analysis. " Bob fumbled under his desk and brought up a display on the wall. I squinted to make out the milky diagrams against the bright sunlight streaming through the window. Bob pointed at a blurry red dot orbiting the blue globe of the Earth. Stylized radio waves connected the ship to a set of radar dishes scattered over the globe. " The Chtarri datastream actually arrives in two separate pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a transmission for each individual shortly after birth. The higher frequency datastream contains the time and latitude-longitude of the birth, which we can correlate with the individual newborn. The lower frequency stream contains the actual deathday. Both streams are encrypted at the receiver and sent here, where we correlate them without decryption and store the information and the decryption key for the parents. " He turned off the display. " But what most people do n't realize is that we decrypt the deathday information separately and use it for statistical analysis. " I had heard rumors of this, but I was still surprised. I turned to stare at Bob. " You actually look at the deathdays? " " Only in a statistical sense. We do n't know which days correspond to which individuals, so there 's no loss of privacy. " He began tapping a pencil on his desk. " And we never release the raw data to the public. " More tapping. " Anyway, data security around here is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're completely compartmentalized. We 've got firewalls inside of firewalls. Hell, I do n't have access to half the information that flows through here. That 's why I need your help. " But what 's the point of collecting the deathday information at all? " " We 're hoping to learn something we can use. For instance, a sharp rise in winter deathdays might indicate a big flu epidemic coming. We would n't know the year, of course, but we could use influenza mortality as a function of age to make a rough guess. Unfortunately, nothing much has ever come of this. " Our conversation drifted into less and less relevant areas, and I was impatient to get started, so I excused myself. Bob cleared his throat. " Bill, there 's one other thing you need to know. Chuang and Krauss-the guys who died playing Russian roulette-according to their friends, they did n't die on their deathdays. " " So they lied about their actual deathdays. Happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. But it 's a strange coincidence that both of them would have lied. Just keep this quiet. People depend on the accuracy of the deathday information to plan their lives. We do n't want to start a panic. " The drive back home would take almost an hour, so I decided to hunt down a cave in the local area. I found a well-equipped one in Batavia, just outside the Institute. The operator on duty took my personal information and gave me a cursory glance. " Booth 6, " he said. " You need to pay in advance if you want more than half an hour " I gave him my card ; no telling how long this would take. I sealed the booth shut and powered up the connection to the Skein. Nodes began to glow in the dark, connected by a tangled coil of multicolored curves. I was relieved to see that this cave used the standard symbology : green curves for AI-generated threads( reliable, but often useless), @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible) and red for threads of unknown origin( danger! Why conceal the origin of a thread?). I started to craft a node to plant in the Skein. This was the true art of a data miner : specifying the node precisely enough to get useful information, but broadly enough to attract the occasional wild-card thread that might hold the answer. I began with the easier job of parsing the date. Time > month November) ANDTime > day 12) AND( Time > year 2122. Pretty straightforward. The cave displayed my node as a calendar, with the date circled. Cute. Then I began work on the cryptic sentence. A spider drifted past my face weaving a green web of threads. I waved, and the spider waved back with its two forelegs. Back to the sentence. Person > I : possible specific Kosnik OR possible generic) AND( Action > am : possible existence OR possible equivalence OR possible identity) AND( Person > you : possible generic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English sentences were still the hardest things to code. Within seconds, spiders swarmed around both of my nodes, weaving their tangled green threads. I traced the threads from the date first, since that seemed more promising. Bundles of threads ran straight into reference engines. Not surprising. I activated one of the engines to see what it would spit out : " November 12, 2122 : 204th " anniversary of the founding of the Austrian Republic. " " November 12, 2122 : 178th anniversary of the sinking of the Tirpitz. " " November 12, 2122 : 141st anniversary of the first balloon crossing of the Pacific Ocean. " " November 12, 2122, 113th anniversary of the outbreak of the Golan War. " The list droned on and on, an ocean of information, but nothing I could use. I checked my second node. Multiple threads splayed out in all directions, but a cluster of them converged on the same node. It was shaped like a church, but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top-the Church of the Feyn. I reset the node, adding a specifier ANDOrganization > Church of the Feyn). Most of the threads vanished, and I traced one to a reference engine : " I am you- one of the eight sacred sayings of the Church of the Feyn. " So Kosnik was one of the Feyn Men. I did n't have much use for the various bizarre cults which had sprung up in the wake of the Chtarri incursion, but this was my only lead, so I could n't afford to ignore it. I love the old Eastern European neighborhoods in Chicago. The summer heat had relented a bit, so I decided to park a few blocks away and walk. A row of identical squat brick houses stretched out before me, each one nestled behind a narrow, neatly-trimmed front lawn. Tree-filtered sunlight dappled the sidewalk. A few old people sat on their front porches watching the world go by. I glimpsed some names on the mailboxes : Velius and Gimbutus and Daukantas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indistinguishable from any of the other houses, except for an unobtrusive Feynman diagram engraved on the door. The door opened to reveal the figure of George Labokas, a middle-aged guy in a white shirt and dark pants, starting to get bald on top and fat around the middle. Not exactly my idea of a cult leader. Labokas led me to an office at the rear of the house. " Can I offer you something to drink? " he asked. " No thanks, " I answered. " I really do n't have much time. " Labokas settled into a maroon leather armchair, and motioned me toward an identical one. I glanced around the room. Aside from a few stylized Feynman diagrams on the wood-panelled walls, there was nothing to mark this room as a Feyn sanctuary. " Well, what can I do for you? " Labokas asked. " You were rather vague on the phone. " " I 've come to ask about one of your members, a Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an apostate. " " A what? " " An apostate. He left our church over a year ago. " " Len Kosnik is dead. And he left a note behind, which said, " I am you '. " Labokas smiled. " He was obviously reaffirming his devotion to our philosophy. A pity that he died before I had a chance to talk to him. How did it happen? " " An automobile accident. He drove to work on his deathday and was killed in a crash. We 're considering it a case of presumed suicide. " " Ridiculous! Did he jump off a bridge? Did he shoot himself in the head? No, he just went for a car trip- " " -on his deathday. " " Kosnik obviously had decided to rejoin our church. And Feyn Men do not kill themselves. " " But you guys believe in reincarnation, so suicide would n't be such a big deal, would it? " " We believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of reincarnation. " Labokas leaned forward and put his fingertips together. " Do you know why all of the electrons in the universe have the same mass? " " No. I 'm not a scientist. " " Richard Feynman showed that there really is only a single electron in the universe. It travels back and forth in time, manifesting itself as an electron or an anti-election, eventually occupying the place of all of the electrons in the universe. In the same way, there is only one human soul, which travels back and forth in time, eventually animating all human beings. Just like the electron in a Feynman diagram. We 're all the same person. Eventually you will get to experience every human life which has ever existed or ever will exist. " " So if you were stuck in a bad existence, why not end it and start over? Seems pretty reasonable to me. " Labokas pursed his lips, and his speech became clipped. " There is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it. No one may take it upon himself to shorten it. I do n't see how I can make myself any clearer. " I decided to change the subject. " Does the date November 12, 2122, mean anything to you? " Labokas leaned back in his armchair. " November 12? Is n't that Veteran 's Day? No wait, that 's November 11. November 12 does n't ring a bell. It certainly has no special significance in our Church. " " Well, thanks for your time. I 'd better be going. " I stood and tried to edge past Labokas. " Would you like some more information on the Church of the Feyn? " Labokas planted himself between me and the door. I grudgingly accepted a few pamphlets. Having paid my " fee " for this visit, I turned to leave. Labokas extended his hand, palm upwards. " I am you. " I very much doubt it. " I got permission from Bob to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pulled up his scratchpad for the day before his death. Meaningless sentences filled the screen : " I am you. " " We are you. " " They are us. " Kosnik seemed like a pretty disturbed guy. An audio file was attached to the scratchpad. I activated it, and it spewed out, " Chtar ri chol fung pyon... " Kosnik had the entire 13-hour transmission hidden on his machine, and it appeared that he had been trying to decipher it. Definitely not part of his job description. I forwarded a progress report to Bob and then spent the next two weeks learning more than I ever wanted to know about the historical trivia associated with November 12th : " Venera 2 space probe launched ", " Yuri Andropov succeeds Leonid Brezhnev ", " Formation of the Baltic Union ". I was getting nowhere, and I wanted to wrap things up by the end of August. My wife 's deathday was coming up in mid-September, and I always tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend some time together, just in case. My break finally came on August 10th. As usual, I stopped into the cave near my house to see if the spiders had made any further progress on my calendar. More useless green threads connected to dozens of items of historical minutiae, but I made out a single red thread, trailing away beyond my visual horizon. I traced it to a private node, a white box with no distinguishing features. It was sealed up tight. I pinged the box. A few seconds later, the box sent back a short blip : " Meet me tomorrow, 9 a.m., 63rd and Cottage Grove. Green dress. " The El rumbled overhead as I cruised down 63rd Street. The South Side was frightening even in broad daylight. I knew I would n't die that day, but nothing prevented my being beaten, robbed, or shot. I spotted a wispy woman in a green dress clutching a small briefcase and glancing furtively up and down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Get in, quick, " I said. " Have you just been lounging around out here? Do you know how dangerous this neighborhood is? " She slid into the front seat, brushed back her stringy black hair, and glared at me. " Of course I know how dangerous it is. I just got off the El. You 're five minutes late. " She turned and glanced out the rear window. " I wanted to make sure nobody saw us together. Take us somewhere private where we can talk. " I pulled onto Lake Shore Drive and headed north. " Who are you? " I asked. " I 'm not going to tell you my name. I could lose my job if anyone finds out about this. " " Do n't worry, I do n't have to reveal my sources. That 's not part of my contract. " " I worked with Jason Krauss. He was my friend. " She wiped something from her eye. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have killed himself. " I pulled into the parking garage at the Museum of Science and Industry. " Nobody will see us here. What do you want to tell me? " " It was Kosnik 's fault. He persuaded Jason and that other guy... " " Chuang? " Yes, Chuang. Kosnik convinced them to take part in some kind of crazy experiment. And Jason ended up dead. " She began to cry softly. " Kosnik was nuts. He told me once that he had cracked the Chtarri message. " " Did Krauss believe him? " " I do n't know. " She pulled a sheaf of papers from her briefcase and fanned them out on the dashboard. " Kosnik and Jason were both obsessed with this, but they never told me why. These are graphs of the total deathdays for everyone born in the last eight years. Here 's the first one, for children born in 2013. Those kids are all eight years old now. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die on January 1st, the second point gives the number who will die on January 2nd, all the way through to December 31st. " The graph was just a flat line with the expected small bumps and wiggles. White noise. The woman pulled up the second sheet. " Now look at this one. It 's for kids born a year later, in 2014. See anything strange? " In the second graph, a small bump rose above the straight line. " That looks like a rise in deathdays for a particular day. " " That particular day " happens to be November 12th, the day you 're interested in. Now look at the third one. " She proceeded to show me all eight graphs, and the bump got larger in each, until in the final graph, it was a sharp spike towering over all of the other dates. " Look at this, " she said. " Almost 1/50 of the children born last year are destined to die on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But what does that mean? " " I have no idea. But it really bothered Jason. He made these copies for me and told me to hold onto them in case anything happened to him. " She sobbed. " You can keep them ; I do n't want anything more to do with this. " She shoved open the car door. " Wait, I have some more questions. " " I told you everything I know. Figure it out yourself. That 's what you 're getting paid for. " She slammed the door and ran away into the bowels of the garage. Why were increasing numbers of children destined to die on November 12th? I entered the deathday data into my computer by hand, and then wandered into the kitchen to get some coffee and think. Something nagged at the back of my mind. What was it that Bob had said about flu epidemics? I jumped up, spilling some of my coffee on the kitchen table, and ran back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables. Suddenly I felt a cold chill creep up my spine. I ran a cross-correlation, with an extrapolation of current lifespan trends. The answer popped onto my screen, stark and implacable : a death sentence for us all. And in my cold terror, I understood what Kosnik and Chuang and Krauss had done. Bob dropped my final report onto his desk ; it landed with a dull thud. " I do n't get it, " he said. " You claim that the number of newborns with a November 12th deathday has been increasing every year. What does that mean? And what does it have to do with November 12, 2122? " I paused for a few seconds to collect my thoughts. " It turns out that November 12, 2122 will be a very special day in human history. " I leaned back in my chair. " It 's the end of the world. " Bob smiled. " Come on, Bill, stop kidding around. " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll happen. Nuclear war? Bioterrorism? Maybe even an asteroid strike. All I know is that on November 12, 2122, everyone living on the planet will die. Bob 's smile vanished. " That 's just crazy. What makes you think that? " " It 's the pattern of the deathdays. Think about it. Kids born four or five years ago will be 105 or 106 when the year 2122 rolls around. Not many of them will make it that far, but a few will, and those lucky few will all die at the same time on November 12, 2122. That 's what gives the small bump in the deathday graph. And what about the kids born last year? They 'll only be 102 when the missiles fly or the meteor strikes. I checked the mortality tables ; a child born today has almost a 2% chance of living to 102. And all of that 2% are going to die together on November 12, 2122. That 's what gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't believe you. " " Just wait and see. The signal will get stronger every year. A child born ten years from now will only have to make it to 90 to see the end of the world. More than a quarter of the population can expect to live that long. How are you going to hide it from the general public when one-fourth of the newborns have a November 12th deathday? " Bob stared at my report, then looked back up at me without saying a word. I stood and leaned over his desk. " It 's obvious that Krauss and Chuang and Kosnik reached the same conclusions, " I said. " And that 's why they committed suicide? " I gazed past Bob out of the window, out over the prairie grass rippling in the wind. " We 're all prisoners of fate, doomed to die on our deathdays. But I believe that the Chtarri message contains the key to getting out of that prison. Kosnik really did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to evade the predicted deathdays. But he needed some volunteers to test his theory. So he recruited Chuang and Krauss to see if it would be possible for them to die on a day other than their deathdays. They knew what was at stake. Maybe they were willing to sacrifice their lives to prove that the end of the world could be evaded. Or more likely they did n't really believe in their guts that it would be possible to die on the wrong day. We 'll never know. But their deaths show that Kosnik was right. The end predicted by the deathday data is not inevitable. " Bob shook his head. " Nonsense. Kosnik was a statistician. How could he succeed in translating the Chtarri message where all of our linguists have failed? " " Because Kosnik figured out who the Chtarri are and where they come from. " I am you. " They are us. " Kosnik was n't planning to rejoin the Feyn Men, but their ideas gave him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are us. Our descendents, from a thousand millennia in the future, evolved beyond recognition, evolved into creatures so alien that mutual communication is impossible. And their very existence means that the end of the world is not inevitable. We can find a way to evade our deathdays if we can crack their message. 2026 My deathday was July 18th. I spent it this year as I have every year for the past three : boating on Lake Michigan. Of course, like everyone else, I have no idea now of the day on which I will actually die. Does this mean that the world wo n't end on Nov. 12th, 2122, after all? I do n't know ; that 's a question for the scientists and philosophers. What I do know is that I will die on a random day in a random year, known only to God. And that 's just fine with me.
