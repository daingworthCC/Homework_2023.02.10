1013541 My hometown flooded. Prediction, as usual, failed us. Come midnight I was the sixty-year-old owner of a river-view colonial, asleep on his second story. By 3:00 A.M., the river was my first floor and wanted my second. <p> I kept an aluminum flatboat in the back yard ; had n't thought of the thing since last bass season. And yet it waked me like some good pet. Its prow kept beating gentle against my upstairs bedroom wall. Spooked, I set my bare white feet... into six inches of cold gritty water. I soon went headfirst out my highest window into a waiting boat. It was all so weird it felt natural. A 1970 outboard motor, untouched for months, somehow sputtered to life. Starting off I felt fearless as a boy. No streetlamp worked. Just a crescent moon refolding over currents as I chugged between treetops. " This is real, " I told my Evinrude 's racket. " Dad 's house is ruined. -Boat seems fine though. People probably stranded... " Our neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots, four-car garages, one canoe dock per home. This happened September 15, 1999, a North Carolina hurricane named Floyd. Winds, threatened all afternoon, proved nothing much-the unexpected sneaked in after dark. Tonight what first seemed silence became a million suckings, bubblings, gurgles. Instead of rain driving down, it was wetness, black, canceling us from underneath. Wind spares some things. Water, climbing, testing, claims them all. At least in midSeptember it was n't too cold. I sounded like my late wife : Jean was always finding the glass half-full. Now everything was. I motored our Alumicraft from house to major house. I made all my usual walker 's shortcuts but now at roof level. The Hutchesons, half-dressed, on their third-floor turret, stood behind two barbecue grills blazing as signal pyres. I tied up to their Flemishbond chimney, calling, " Ride, folks? " " Well, well, our favorite insurance agent. We covered for " acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxers, sounded amused. " Because just yesterday I paid a man twenty-six thousand for finally painting this doggone barn! " Hutch kept gesturing toward water, hinting with his arms that it should split like the Red Sea. Hutch laughed till he coughed. His wife gave me a look. Their teenage daughter said, " Even tonight, Dad, you talk only about money, Dad. You 're sadder even than this, " and she nodded toward our former neighborhood. We eased Hutch into my boat. Familiar streets seemed the canals of Venice, and we always had right-of-way. Humidity sogged your clothes then shoes. The darkness smelled of transmission fluid and ginger lilies. There came roarings from the distance. In a friend 's sunken carport, his new Lexus acted mighty shorted-out : under five feet of green sludge, it ran every possible lighting combination, brights to dim to flashers, oddly beautiful, a dead loss. -Which neighbors were home, which home drowned? We tacked by all three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunks. They told us the mall was still above water, rescue trucks gathering there. These kids had surfed since age six and now, splashing off noplace, called back to me, " Is this not awesome, man? " -For once, the word fit. I might 've shouted : " It 's not some mountain stream you 're swimming in. Our neighborhood 's gone septic tank, kids. " But they would all three learn this later. I just let it go. You ca n't monitor everything. On top of a gazebo, Charlie Hague, four-time winner of our Top Golfer Cup, nursed the flame of his gold lighter. Kneeling in p.j. ' s, he stared out of an avocado facial. Tonight Charlie 'd actually forgot his Hollywood handsomeness. Face caked green, the guy looked like some Fiji headhunter, especially once in my boat. The Hutchesons helped Charlie and his tough-talking new wife down into our sixteen-footer. The wife rose behind him, pressing one finger across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letting all of Riverside see her ex-Marine CEO primped for usual beauty rest. -Charlie, as my late wife called it, " moisturized. " Moisturize! Our mall lot, overlit by twelve generators, glowed the only brightness for whole square miles of night. Approached by boat, it looked like the shores of Heaven, I swear. I started dropping off my neighbors. Nine drowned bodies were already stretched beyond the dumpsters. Seven had been nonswimmers from the projects. People said not to worry, refrigerated trucks were on the way. II. I just kept boating back for more. Excellent-staying busy. Since Jean died, aside from my golf-and-coffee pals, it 'd been mostly me and the leading sports channels. One genius secretary pretty much ran my office. I had perfected Sitting on a Dock with Bourbon-and-Water, had brought that sport to new heights. Overnight, I 'd been shanghaied back to action. Odd, but losing everything made me feel decades younger. That could n't last.( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prediction!) My neighborhood stood two stories deep in... well, in shit. Was n't this some early practice-form of dying? And yet, at first at least, I felt alive because once more a little useful. Did n't know quite how this mess had happened. But, some way, I knew exactly what to do. Bart Tarlton waved a flashlight, signing I should boat on past, just leave them atop their carport roof. " Others will be by, and she 's not... ready. " He shined the beam on Caitlin, squatted, arranging soggy child-photographs across the roof 's white gravel. " Cait 's got lots of Saran Wrap up here. " Bart sounded sad. " She 's busy sealing all of Carolyn 's baby pictures. Keeps saying, " First things first. " -Thanks for stopping, pal, but we 've got to get through this part. Hell, where else are we going? " He shook his head. " Oh, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure glad your dad did n't live to see this. I know he thought the world of your house. " It amazed me that while his own wife sat playing dollhouse with baby photos, Bart would be imagining my father. True, this would have re-killed Dad. In 1950 he overpaid for our stone manse, guaranteeing my boyhood social standing. On a street known for its brain surgeons and college presidents, my dad was manager of Milady 's FootFair. To make the fierce down payment on our 1939 colonial, he would gladly kneel half a century before Riverside 's worst female feet. Dad 's wish? That I run wild with our Episcopal rector 's delinquent( if platinum blond) sons. We did shoot hoops ; we raced our boats ; we took bourbon to a science. Still, neighbors never called Dad anything but " Shoe " Connelly. " Proves I know my stock, " the sweet guy smiled. He titled our house " Shadowlawn " ; painted its front door a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and funny, I knew to never claim much. Always sent these buddies home when Dad, back late from work, three vodkas in, started, " Best in town? I 'd say young Diana du Pres has the toes of a Greek goddess. -Joy to see, touch, and serve. " Dawn came pink and gold but with many a wet and sorry sight. Numbers of drowned long-horned cattle-washed into town from where? These stacked up under bridges like something from the Wild West. And on top of a pile of such carcasses out near the underpass? Two live deer, a mother and baby, just stood grooming each other. I heard, " Mister? Boat! Mister Boat!? " Soon I wrestled onboard two skinny water-treading black kids. They 'd Australian-crawled clear from the projects. The weakest swimmer was looped within an inner tube he kept blowing up while kicking forward. Each tried shaking my hand as thanks, even while-with my bad back-I fought to pull them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kids were about fifteen and looked scared to death and we did n't talk much. I had a boat. They were in it now. Happy ending. With them settled, I figured I 'd go rescue a gal my age I 've always liked. She 'd probably be alone tonight : her dashing husband was two-timing her with his freckled college-boy " executive assistant. " Every local knew except maybe my friend. I sloshed toward her now : our generation 's all-time Riverside glamourpuss. The face that launched... at least one bass boat. Hers were certainly the feet that kicked off my Dad 's praise. " White marble, " he announced, as Mom and I gave each other steady looks. But Shoe Connelly was right, she was perfect. Unfair advantage in a town this small. I hated loving the very one my Dad would want for me, for us. I lacked the looks, height, trust fund. Only had such access as Shoe 'd overpaid for.( Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, an oar in the boat, the beloved ole coot, so naturalized he 's colorless.) And yet, even now, with me sogged and sixty, I still pictured my ideal, stranded on her second-story balcony, wearing satin like her " Juliet " in our school play. Figured I 'd go muscular up a vine, then bring her to my waiting gondola below, her satin frock pressed damp within these brawny arms, etc., whatever. Pathetic. Still, I aimed her way. -I am a widower now. Churches, sunken as private homes, somehow looked sadder, having once claimed more. At least their steeples gave every boater bearings. As I motored past First Baptist 's chromium upright, it showed a thousand steel rivets, a fuselage of copper flashing. Each steeple seemed just so much armor. Poking above our waterline, every denomination insisted on itself. In our Williamsburgy town, even the synagogue sports a steeple. Churches are often set face-to-face on corners opposite each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wren minaret be long in coming? -Ours is a God-fearing community. Afraid of what? Plagues? Wars? Floods? Looking clear downtown, I saw just trees and steeples bristling to the blue distance. And over all this, without form, and void, news-channel helicopters getting great shots of poor people clawing up their chimneys waving bedsheets. You did n't need to be a structural engineer to know that most of our street 's fine old homes were done for now. You let a house, however well-made, stand in twenty feet of water for one week, that 's curtains. The mold alone will kill you ever afterward. I sputtered past the Epsteins " pinkstucco Spanish colonial, the Murchesons " replica of Andrew Jackson 's home, The Hermitage. In its basement rec room I 'd first felt a girl 's breast, the left one only, but enough aplenty to interest me in life. Now I banked behind my dead wife 's girlhood home. The breast in question had not, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here among the camellias of her mother 's formal garden, Jean and I married, June 1968. Now around our altar-pergola 's Corinthian columns, sewage bobbled. I chose not to Alumi-craft past my house. I recalled overhearing an old dowager say, " Those shanty Irish would shoehorn themselves into the biggest home right on the river. " Photo albums were most of what I wanted, and my bronzed baby-bootie that Dad made much of. Those, stowed in the attic, might still be safe. But for now I had people here... The boys sat discussing friends : " You think they got Lottie up on they roof? She say she could n't be leaving them kids but, still... somebody bound to find them, maybe one these choppers? Could be, this here City Man, once he finishes gettin " his folks out, might could go on back, fetch Lottie and her kids...? " So my passengers saw me as a town employee! Paid to rescue them. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange.( Son of " Shoe, " after all.) What had I expected, Life-Saving Merit Badge? Did it really change anything-being assumed? Till now had n't that been pretty much my life 's goal hereabouts? Unlike the boys " pals, most of mine got rescued by first light. Other Riverside boaters, using personal canoes, Sailfishes, and paddle wheels, had hoisted neighbors off their butlers " quarters, SUV roofs, pin oaks, and from the head of at least one life-size bronze St. Francis. My bass boat had retrieved maybe thirty to the mall when we finally sloshed into the yard of the woman I have loved since age thirteen.( In fact, her left breast was my first breast, ever.) Her Wright-style low-slung home seemed missing in action, but I saw she 'd breaststroked toward the only sturdy vertical around. I found our town beauty treed like a wet raccoon. Prediction so regularly fails me : For fifty years I 've believed she was maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought our owning in Riverside outranked our lace-curtain Irishness, made us Lord Proprietors. Man never really guessed that " Shoe " is a servant 's name.( I fought to keep it from him. Of that at least I 'm proud.) She 'd been born rich with red hair and green eyes so you did n't know if you were coming or going. Seeing how I and six other boys from the cul-de-sac loved her, she had promoted her plainer sidekick for my attention. She offered me the girl who let her copy homework, who held her coat and laughed at her usual jokes, the gal Friday who personally delivered her sarcastic notebookpaper come-ons to us sad hopeful males. One such note, handbrought, explained : Jean here is smarter than I and looks-wise grows on people. She has scads more money than I 'll get( even when Dad finally goes). And trust me, she loves you WAY more. Choose Jean, Mitch. I stared into the fine if simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how its contents had just shifted her future and mine. " Return answer? " she, innocent, asked. -I smiled at her. I kept that note for twenty years. A town beauty always makes such matches for her handmaids. And somehow I had done as told. Was Jean also just following orders? Dad, even knowing Jean 's net worth to the dollar, still always treated her with fond pity. And yet our marriage proved fairly lively, forty years. Not a love match, maybe, but... practical. We were really just best friends. I guessed at my own face 's sketchy net worth. I 'd really wanted to head North to college, where my brightness-or goodness, whatever-might get me noticed as more than the byproduct of flatfooted others. My Jean had proved a wit, a " man 's woman " regularly out snagging bass with me from this same boat. I had chosen well, at least, in picking the one who picked Jean for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, had all but disappeared. Not since our thirteenth year had I ever caught her without benefit of makeup. Now aside from orangenylon panties, poor thing was damp and bare as God made her. Coiled around a rough-barked pine tree, her white marble was curdled all over. " Uh-oh. That old lady she butt naked, " one kid observed. " It 's okay, " I said. " I know her. " " Gosh, it 's Mitch. And me hoping to be rescued by some handsome Yankee new to town. -But, hell, no secrets " twixt old friends, hunh? " " Diana, " I nodded, as if greeting her at the club. I had a tarp in my boat and soon wrapped her with it. Her lips were blue( the nipples also, truth be told). There have been years when I worried I still loved her more than my wry, quiet wife. This lady up the tree should 've founded Flirters Anonymous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long battle for her hand. III. What I remember best is how the flood confused or dignified our animals. Some little neighbor kids I ferried, they would have their Yorkie terriers wound in doll blankets or their tetchy Siamese cats along. I saw how it comforted even four-year-olds to take care of something still smaller than themselves. A dozen water moccasins tried crawling in the boat with us and had to be discouraged, but I could n't bring myself to crush one with the oar. You 'd just redirect them and hope they 'd swim against some sturdy log. A few birds were very noisy, as if sounding the alarm for all us other creatures, but most kept silent. They lined up along lower tree limbs, looking out and down like tourists. The oddest things floated. A yellow high heel. An oil-painted photo, some bride and groom shown smearing cake across each other 's laughing mouths, its wooden frame like a life preserver bobbing them along. I felt more shocked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collie), by all the swollen pigs and cows, by those clever living deer swimming here and there in a strange but mild-looking panic. By 8:30 A.M., having found these kids and then Diana, I figured I had my boatful. Could reverse directions. Doing a last hairpin curve over the former Shady Circle Drive twelve feet under, I thought I heard shouts. The kids stayed quiet if with teeth chattering. Though teenaged boys, they kept their arms around each other for sheer warmth. Diana sat hidden within tarp, silent as royalty, looking out at all the water hiding her old holy stomping ground. She rested, staring in a clear and noiseless sort of way that made me remember why I loved her. The mall would have its bonfires, media, hot tomato soup. First I 'd just swing back by, check if Cait Tarlton and her photo show had been saved. Odd, it seemed that I, full of tidal surge myself, would always run this bass-boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, this leg-up shoe-clerk service. I felt relaxed in ways that might have been hysteria or gratitude or both. Water seeks its own level. Without one real possession past my clothes, this motor boat, a wedding ring, I felt lightened, simplified. But also babyish, exposed. The damp fetus somehow sixty, out on good behavior. A nineteen-room house? Dad 's idea. Marrying Jean? Some great notion of Diana 's then Jean 's then all of Riverside who loved us two sweet runts. " Good idea. Who else will they get? I think they 're cute together. " Surely now I could finally move on. We heard a terrible yodeling. It sounded pitiful but violent. I glanced back at my boy passengers. I could tell they dreaded whatever sight such sounds would bring us. I chugged across Hutcheson property, over Greta 's beautiful knot garden spoilt in brown water beneath. At the corner of Carter and Shady Circle, in what was the front yard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two young golden retrievers. Flailing, by now they were barely afloat. Dogs kept paddling in gulping circles, reduced to saving themselves by climbing up onto each other 's backs. Nails and teeth of each had slashed the other bloody. Seeing help, they howled and, spastic, flapping, angled to face us. But what most struck us in the boat : Though water here easily went down fourteen feet, despite higher ground 's being visible close by, these yellow dogs still made themselves swim-whimpering circles-right over their owner 's yard. No wall, no street was visible, only drifting firewood and the dark free currents coursing everywhere. And yet both animals stayed put, treading the very water they were bloodying. On a playground twenty feet away, they could have saved their lives and rested. Instead, as if assigned one jail cell, pets spasmed back and forth, to and fro, floundering in that one brackish narrow. We called them and, treading halfunder, they gladly turned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanting help yet scared to come for it. One kid behind me asked, " Why they hanging there, Mister? " I only knew while answering, " It 's their " Invisible Fence. " They think the power 's still on. So scared of one little shock, they 're drowning right above their yard. " We slapped water, " Here boys! " No go. The dogs " collars were fitted with electrical stunners meant to keep them in the yard. A triggering line lay buried, sunken. Just the idea of a jolt kept them trapped. Electricity citywide had been shut off since 3:00 A.M. Their owners were not home to help. I saw one dog had actually shed its red collar. Still the poor creatures stayed. They must have scrambled up the house 's sides as water rose, then onto its roof, and finally out to the property 's front edge. And here they swam in bloody goldfish circles these hours later. I tried explaining their security system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't quite register the setup. It would 've seemed over-elaborate, wasteful in their neighborhood. Seemed that way here, too. Diana kept silent. I was now so glad for these youngsters " strength. As I watched drowning dogs go under, gnashing at each other, teeth chewing each other 's necks, I started feeling sick. I went half faint myself-from motor fumes? Maybe stress. Since waking to find my first-floor sodden-I 'd had a surge super-human, pure attention mainly for others. Heck, I 'd been in this boat for what? six hours straight. Need be, just peeing off the side. But now I understood I had n't eaten since the night before, and then only a bowl of warmed-over stew. Could I somehow be a skinny ole guy suddenly sixty? Oh definitely. And, considering another rescue-of dogs so crazed and young and heavyI felt myself go weak as water. Such gratitude now as four able brown hands( ivory palms) hooked the one poor creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with damp loud thwunks into the bottom of our rocking boat. Soon as the gasping dogs were with us and safe on their sides, their tails, almost mechanical, beat three times very hard against aluminum. For a split second they looked over at each other. Just that once, but with such great joint effort. Then both fell dead asleep. This, of all things, shook me. Of every triggering sight today, this seemed so sad and wonderful, their being saved if bloody, their staring at each other to acknowledge that, then out. I could see now : one was male, one female. So, a marriage. But the way they 'd checked on each other before agreeing to lose consciousness, that was a true killer. I can not describe it well enough. But when I looked at the kids astern, I felt glad they 'd gone half wet-eyed, too. Pals sat hugging. Diana barely noticed anybody, gazing out at all our water. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. People always praised Jean 's jokes and smile as " dry " -a holy word today. Should n't I have felt more grateful, forty years spent riding alongside someone so forgiving? I 'd been the worst sort of snob-mine, a shoeclerk 's snobbery. Now, finally qualified, I wanted my wife back. Now I was earning her. One of the boys saw me shaken. Polite, he waited a few minutes before calling, " When you done with this load? if you still on the clock? figure you could maybe take us back to where some our folks need hep, too? " " You bet you. " With final prizes-three people and two live dogs, after all-I could head to higher ground. Our neighborhood smelled of raw pine sap so strong it burned your eyes like Lysol. You got a snootful of hog waste and this strange new scent, almost sweet. It was the smell of just so goddamn much water left all to itself and allowed to rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pinkish talcum( dust flying in odd puffs as if fearful of becoming mud). But far under our boat, braiding currents pushed blackness over former golf courses and car lots. We squinted in the smell of what 's wild. Freedom, chaos, everything let loose at once. It was something not even my greatgrandparents got to sniff : it was the smell of wilderness, doing all it wanted before any of us ever got here. -Doing all it will do once it has finally shed us. IV. Well, I just turned sixty-five. " Mitch 's Boat People " they call themselves? they threw me a surprise party. Antoine and Sam and Lottie and her kids were all there. Plus Diana, again looking forty-eight if a day. And the Hutchesons and Charlie Hague( with his skin like a girl 's). Before floodwater dropped quite four feet, I 'd already retired from Insurance. If you think that paying it is hard, imagine the torture of quadruplicate record-keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my second story.( Insurance had been Dad 's idea : " Take advantage of our contacts, " Shoe said.) The flood made me a thinker, made me mad, or smart. Not sure. Was it a breakdown afterward or some overdue insight? Maybe all the above. A flood, after all. We 'd been on our own and somehow briefly managed for each other. There truly was no government. No electricity, no property lines. No houses! There was whoever, in swimming distance, needed your little boat. One thing I know now : It 's a privilege to at least try saving each other. It 's also a full-time job. Riverside had been our one bluechip sure thing, the citadel everybody in this part of our state aspired to. Now? it 's a huge contaminated park, river view, not one 1939 " colonial " still standing. So much for American history( a series of revivals anyway, I guess). Six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people in Falls still seeing shrinks you would not believe. Me, I have a new lady friend actually. Total charmer, too. Must be doing little something right. I was spared owning even one stick of furniture worth saving. Blessing in disguise. And Dad 's " ancestral home, " well-insured? So much harum-scarum flagstone way downstream. These days I occupy a year-old maintenance-free condo, three miles from any river, thanks. I like it here. White interiors. No floral wallpaper. One table, one bed. I guess I live like a 1950s shoe clerk, strictly within his means. I live like a renter. Retired, I take three morning papers. From the Times to the localest, I read them religiously. Aside from Sports, I 'd let the world drift to hell in a handbasket. It sure got worse without my monitoring! Prediction and leadership keep failing us. Is it as bad as it seems or does this just mean I 'm sixty-five? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, must presently smell like Falls did right after the flood. These days, maybe only the old and semi-brave should even bother keeping up with current events? Only those with boats! Now I sit quiet and dryly puzzle out my whole career : the choosing Insurance, marrying Jean, not waiting for Diana, my old choices. Probably unadventurous to stay put in my hometown. And in that Founding Fathers palace Dad bought for me, one high heel at a time. " Never let " Shadowlawn " pass out of family hands, " he begged at the end. -Poor old Shoe. He died believing in American permanence. He did n't notice China waiting, humongous, behind us in line. He never guessed how fast we 'd squander our foolproof national inheritance. Finally, I can now live anyplace on earth. Some other locals my age moved en masse to bone-dry Phoenix. But so many folks I know are still stuck here, still getting over that one night. We 've become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. New kinds of people in my circle. These days, between us, so much can go unsaid. Since that night, I 've given lots of Jean 's family money away. It never really felt mine. Now that I can really begin again, I seem to have chosen to be here. It 's no longer my father 's neighborhood, not Jean 's or Diana 's. There 's nothing left of Riverside. And, see, that 's what makes my staying put a choice. You can come to know your place, even this late in a life. Six years later, the swimming animals still agitate my dreams : I 'll walk into a mall, our mall, and it has been sealed then flooded as if to make a skating rink but overfilled with floating scared wild animals, smelling not terrible but more like wet-wool overcoats, these creatures making no sounds except the frantic slaps of paws, the kicks of their hard hooves, splashing then knocking against mall glass, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, terrified. I 'm left to guess : How many fences still hold me to this spot? I am Mitch, sixty-five. I have been a loyal dog-paddler here my whole life. Overly loyal. To what? Before our flood, my drink of choice was Jack Daniel 's and water. These days? I take it straight.
