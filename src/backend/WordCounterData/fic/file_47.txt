1007441 <p> It was not a hotel. It was a kind of pension where, at the most, there were four or five guests. In the morning, breakfast on a tray was placed on a shelf in the corridor : bread, butter, honey, and slices of a sausage that is a specialty of the city. Beside the tray, there were packets of Nescafe and an electric kettle. Contact with the severe and serene young women who ran the place was minimal. <p> In the bedroom, all the furniture, made of either oak or walnut, was old and must have dated from before the Second World War. This was the only major Polish city to have survived the war without its buildings being seriously damaged. In the pension, there was a sense, as in a convent or a monastery, that people had been contemplatively looking through the two windows which gave onto the streets for generations. <p> The building was on Miodowa Street in Kazimierz, the old Jewish quarter of Krakow. After breakfast, I asked a young woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank machine. She had a violin case in her hands. She put it down with a show of irritation, and picked up a tourist map of the city. She marked in pencil where I had to go. It 's not far, she said, sighing regretfully, as if she wished she were sending me to the other side of the world. I bowed discreetly, opened and shut the front door, turned right, took the first right again, and found myself in the Plac Nowy, an open market square. <p> I have never been in this square before and yet I know it by heart, or, rather, I know by heart the people who are selling things in it. Some of them have regular stalls with awnings to keep the sun off their goods. It is already hot, hot with the blurred, gnat heat of the Eastern European plains and forest. A foliage heat. A heat without the Mediterranean 's assurance. Here nothing is certain. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other sellers -- all of them women -- have come from the outlying villages with their own produce in baskets or buckets and do not have stalls. They sit on stools they brought with them. A few stand. <p> Lettuces, red radishes, horseradishes, dill like green lace, small knobby cucumbers( which in this heat grow in three days), new potatoes( their skins with a little powdered earth on them, the color of grandchildren 's knees), celery with its cleansing toothbrush smell, cuttings of liveche( which the men, drinking vodka, swear is an incomparable aphrodisiac), bunches of young carrots carried home from school by children with Polish blue eyes, cut roses( mostly yellow), cottage cheeses that the rags pegged to the clothesline in the garden still smell of, wild green asparagus that the children were sent to look for near the village cemetery. <p> The women on their stools sit, saying nothing. They are immobile, expressionless, and rely on their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought to sell from their own gardens -- surrounded by wooden fences, behind two-roomed houses made from logs, with single stoves( covered in tiles) between the two rooms. The women live in chatas like this. <p> I wander among them. Different ages. Different builds. Eyes of different colors. No two women wearing the same kerchief. But each one with her own way of protecting or favoring the small of her back as she bends -- the earth is such a long way down -- to cut chives or pull out dogtooth weed. When they were younger, their hips absorbed the shock of events ; now it is their shoulders. <p> I peer into the basket of a woman who is standing ; she has no stool. The basket is full of pale-golden pastries. They look like carved chessmen. Each one is about six inches high. <p> I pick up a castle and realize my mistake. It is too heavy to be made of pastry. <p> I glance up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes. She looks back at me severely, as if at an idiot. Oscypek, she says slowly. It 's the name of a cheese made from the milk of mountain sheep and smoked in the chimney between the two rooms. I buy three. Then, with the smallest gesture of her head, she suggests I get on my way. <p> In the center of the square stands a low building, divided into small, round shops. There is a barber 's with one chair. Several butchers. A grocer 's where you can buy pickled cabbage from a barrel. A kitchen with a cast-iron stove where you can get soup, and, outside on the paving stones, three wooden tables with benches. At one of them, a man with slightly dejected shoulders is sitting. He has long hands and a high forehead, which seems even higher because he is going bald. His spectacles have thick lenses. I know this man. Although he is not Polish, he looks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borscht. <p> Ken was born in New Zealand and died there. I sit on the bench opposite him. This man, sixty years ago, shared with me what he knew, although he never told me how he 'd learned it. He never spoke about his childhood or his parents. I had the impression he left New Zealand for Europe when he was young, before he was twenty. <p> Distances never daunted him. Wellington, Paris, New York, London, Norway, Spain, and, at some moment, I think, Burma or India. He earned his living, variously, as a journalist, a schoolteacher, a dance instructor, an extra in films, a gigolo, a bookseller without a shop, a cricket umpire. In Paris, he drew cartoons for a newspaper. I remember distinctly the kind of toothbrushes he liked -- ones with extra-long handles -- and the size of his shoe( 44). <p> He pushes his bowl of soup toward me, then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoon, and hands it to me. I recognize the black tartan handkerchief. The soup is a clear, deep-red vegetable borscht, with a little apple vinegar added to it, Polish style, to counter the natural sweetness of the beetroot. I eat some and push the bowl back and hand him the spoon. No word has passed between us. <p> From the bag slung over my shoulder I take out a sketchbook. I want to show him a drawing I made yesterday, from Leonardo 's " Lady with an Ermine, " in the Czartoryski Museum. He studies it, his heavy glasses slipping a little down his nose. <p> Pas mal! Yet is n't she too upright? Is n't she in fact leaning more as she takes the corner? <p> When I hear him speak -- the manner is so indisputably his -- my love for him returns, my love for his journeys, his appetites( which he set out to satisfy and never suppressed), his weariness, his sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he repeats. Never mind. Every copy has to change something, does n't it? <p> And my love for his lack of illusions. Being without illusions, he avoided disillusionment. <p> When I first met him, I was eleven and he was forty. For the next six or seven years, he was the most influential person in my life. It was with him that I learned to cross frontiers. In French there is the word passeur -- often translated as " ferryman " or " smuggler, " but with the connotation of a guide and something of the mountains. He was my passeur. <p> Ken flips through the sketchbook. He had deft fingers and could palm cards skillfully. He puts a finger between two pages and stops. <p> Another copy? Antonello da Messina? <p> " Dead Christ Supported by Angel, " I say. <p> Antonello, he says. If I could choose to have my portrait painted by any artist in history, I 'd choose him. He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind of coherence and authority, and it was during his lifetime that the first printing presses were invented. <p> He looks down again at the sketch. <p> Not a trace of pity on the angel 's face, he says, only tenderness. You 've caught that tenderness, but not the gravity, the gravity of the first printed words. That 's gone for good. <p> I did it last year in the Prado. Until the guards came to chuck me out. <p> Anyone has the right to draw there, no? <p> Yes, but not to sit on the floor. <p> Then why did n't you draw standing up! <p> When Ken says this, in the Plac Nowy, I see him, tall, stooped, standing on the edge of a cliff, drawing the sea. Somewhere near Brighton, the summer of 1939. He always had in his pocket a large black graphite pencil called a Black Prince, which, instead of being round, was rectangular, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old now, I tell him, to draw for a long time standing up. <p> He puts down the sketchbook abruptly. He abhorred self-pity. The weakness, he said, of many intellectuals. Avoid it! His only moral imperative. <p> He fingers one of the cheeses I have bought. <p> Her name is Jagusia, he says, nodding in the direction of the woman with the basket, and she comes from the mountains, in Podhale. Her two sons work in Germany. Black-market labor. Hard for them to get work permits ; they 're forced to be illegal. Neanmoins, they 're building a house, one larger than Jagusia has even dreamt of, with three stories and not two rooms but seven! <p> Neanmoins! French words crop up in his sentences. He had lived in Paris before coming to London, and the French years were the happiest of his life -- he sometimes wore a black beret. <p> Yet Jagusia will refuse, he prophesies, to move out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the garden. <p> This was the man who made me believe that together we could find the magic in any city. <p> What about a beer? he says, pointing toward the far end of the market. <p> The cans of beer are in a stall with dried beans, mustard, biscuits, honey bread, and tinned meats. There is also an open chessboard and a game in progress. The grocer behind the stand is playing black, and a man who looks like a passerby is playing white. Several pawns, a knight, and a bishop have been taken. <p> I ask for two beers. White moves his queen and says, " Check! " <p> Black takes my money and moves a knight. <p> The queen withdraws. <p> A woman customer asks for some of the honey bread, which has sweet candied oranges buried in it. Black cuts the slices and weighs them. <p> White makes a careless move and realizes too late what he 's done. He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Jewish ghetto, on the other side of the Vistula, is less than ten minutes from here. The ghetto, an area of a small city block, was sealed off by walled-up buildings, blockades, and barbed wire, and, six months later, eighteen thousand people were imprisoned there. Thousands died from disease and malnutrition each month. Only those fit enough to work as slave labor in the German armament or clothing factories were permitted to leave for their shifts. All other trespassers outside the ghetto were shot, as were any Poles who helped them or hid them. <p> Tyskie! Ken applauds when I return to the table. You chose the best beer! <p> Early training, I say. <p> He 's called Zedrek, Ken says, the man you were watching playing chess. He plays with Abram, the grocer, at least once a week. Zedrek could play a good game if he had n't started drinking vodka so early. I do n't think he can stop, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and survived in hiding. <p> Ken taught me most of the games I know : chess, snooker, darts, billiards, poker, table tennis, backgammon. Chess we played in his bed-sit, the others in bars. Bridge, which I had learned before I met him, we played with my parents or when we got invited to somebody 's house, which was not often. <p> He was a replacement teacher in the lunatic boarding school into which I had been bundled. In front of the school assembly -- fifty bare-kneed, cowed boys, each trying to find, unaided, a sense to life -- the apoplectic headmaster was in a rage and had thrown a dining-room chair at the Latin teacher, and Ken, who happened to be between them, caught it in mid-flight with one hand. That was how I first noticed him. He set the chair down, put his feet up on it, and the headmaster, undeterred, continued with his harangue. This was 1937. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to stay with me and my parents. They had a caravan on a beach, near Selsey Bill in Sussex. <p> Why not? he said. And he came for a week. <p> My father was pleased : with Ken, we were a foursome, and we could play bridge together. <p> Ken shuffled the pack and the cards cascaded between his two hands held far apart. Sometimes the cascade looked like a moving staircase -- an escalator -- or a playing-cards ladder. Once, later, he said to me when I was complaining of not being able to go to sleep : Imagine you 're shuffling a pack of cards! That 's how I go to sleep. <p> My father was a good player, and he enjoyed the game. The game also allowed him to recall certain easy moments with the dead, who otherwise haunted him. When the four of us were playing in Selsey, six diamonds doubled took precedence over five mortars lost. He was playing with us and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only survivor after four years in the trenches near Vimy Ridge and Ypres. <p> My mother recognized that Ken belonged to what for her was the special category of people " who loved Paris. " She foresaw, I 'm sure, that the passeur was going to take me a long way away and, at the same time, she did n't doubt that I was, more or less, capable of looking after myself. On Monday, the wash day, she offered to launder and iron Ken 's clothes, and he, in turn, bought her a bottle of Dubonnet. <p> I accompanied Ken to bars. I was underage, but nobody objected. It was n't my size or looks but my certainty. Do n't look back, he had told me, do n't doubt for a moment -- just be surer of yourself than they are. <p> Once, when another drinker started swearing at me, telling me to get my bloody mouth out of his sight, I broke down. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the street. This was in wartime London, and there were no lights. We walked a long way in silence. If you have to cry, he said finally, and sometimes you ca n't help it, you have to cry afterward, never during! Remember this. Unless you 're with those who love you and only those who love you -- and in that case you 're already lucky, for there are never many who love you -- then you can cry during. Otherwise you cry afterward. <p> Except for his shortsightedness, he moved like an athlete. Not me. I was clumsy, overhasty, cowardly, with almost no poise. I had something else, though, a kind of determination, which, given my age, was startling. I would wager all! And for the energy of that rashness he overlooked the rest. And the gift of his love was the gift of sharing with me what he knew, almost everything he knew, irrespective of my age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the giver and the receiver need to be equal, and we, this strange incongruous couple, somehow became equal. Neither of us understood how this happened. Now we do. We were foreseeing this moment, here in the Plac Nowy. We anticipated my being an old man and his being dead, and this allowed us to be equal. <p> He puts his long hand around the can of beer and clinks it against mine. <p> He always preferred gestures to spoken words. Perhaps as a result of his respect for silent, read words. He studied in libraries, and yet, for him, the immediate place for a book was a raincoat pocket. And the books he pulled out of that pocket! He did not hand them to me directly. He said the name of the author and the title, and placed the book on the corner of the mantelpiece in his bedroom. Sometimes there were several, so that I might choose. George Orwell, " Down and Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swann 's Way " ; Katherine Mansfield, " The Garden Party " ; Laurence Sterne, " The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman " ; Henry Miller, " Tropic of Cancer. " Neither of us believed in literary explanations. I never once asked him about what I could n't understand. He never referred to what, given my age and experience, I might find difficult. Sir Frederick Treves, " The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences. " James Joyce, " Ulysses "( an English edition published in Paris). There was a tacit belief between us that we could learn -- or should try to learn -- how to live partly from books. Oscar Wilde, " De Profundis. " St. John of the Cross. <p> When I returned a book, I felt closer to him. Books converged us. <p> Ken was the first person to talk to me about the Spanish Civil War. Open wounds, he said, nothing can stanch them. I had never heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were at that moment playing billiards in a bar. Do n't forget to chalk the cue, he added. <p> He read to me in Spanish a poem by Garcia Lorca, who had been shot four years earlier, and, when he translated it, I believed, in my fourteen-year-old mind, that I knew -- except for a few details -- what life was about and what had to be risked to live it. <p> Two girls in long white lace dresses are crossing the far end of the Plac Nowy. They are ten or eleven years old, but they are both tall for their age. <p> La semaine blanche, Ken says. Last Sunday, kids across the whole of Poland took their First Communion. And every day this week they do their best to get to church and take Communion once more, particularly the girls, who then get to wear their white Communion dresses another time. <p> The two girls walk side by side, scything down the men whose glances they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they cross the square, they are stepping out of their childhoods. <p> They 're going to the Church of Corpus Christi, Ken says. All the girls of Krakow want to take their First Communion at the Church of Corpus Christi, because the Communion dresses there have the best cut. <p> A woman carrying a basket of wild sorrel passes our table. <p> Could you make us some sorrel soup? Ken asks me. We could have it tomorrow instead of borscht. <p> I guess so. <p> With eggs? <p> No, that I do n't know. <p> Well, he shuts his eyes, you prepare the soup, serve it, and in each bowl you put a hot hard-boiled egg. You then cut the egg into slices, and eat it with the green soup. The mixture -- sharp green acidity and the round comfort of the egg -- reminds you of something extraordinary and far away. <p> Of home? <p> Certainly not, not even for the Poles. <p> Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It seems to me that Ken always lived in the same bed-sit. In reality, he moved often, but the moves were made when I was away at school and, on returning and going to see him, I would find his same few possessions piled up on a similar table at the foot of a similar bed, behind a door with a key, which opened onto a staircase, overlooked by a landlady, always worrying in the same way about the lights being left on. <p> Ken 's room had a gas fire and a tall window. On the mantelpiece were the books. On the table by the window was a large portable wireless( the word " radio " was rarely used). September 1st. I remember that we were both listening : The Panzer Divisions of the Wehrmacht invaded Poland without warning this morning at dawn. <p> In the room 's wardrobe he kept not only clothes but food : oatmeal biscuits, hard-boiled eggs, a pineapple, coffee. Attached to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saucepan that he kept on the windowsill. The room smelled of cigarettes, fruit, and lighter fluid. The toilet and washbasin were on the landing. It was either on the landing above or the one below ; I tended to forget, and he would have to shout after me : Up, not down! <p> His two suitcases, which he left open on the floor, were never entirely unpacked.( At that time, nothing was unpacked, even in people 's heads. Everything was in storage or in transit. Dreams were kept on luggage racks.) In one of his suitcases there was a jar of honey from Brittany, a dark fisherman 's sweater, a volume of Baudelaire, and a table-tennis paddle. <p> Give you a lead of fifteen plus service, he proposed. Ready? Serve! Fifteen-love. Fifteen-one. Fifteen-two. Fifteen-three. That was in 1940. <p> By 1941 he was still beating me two games out of three, but he was no longer giving me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity for a foreign service at the BBC( about which he would say nothing). He often came back to the room after work in the small hours of the morning. The bedcover was damask. <p> In the mornings, we took breakfast in a barricaded cafe near Gloucester Road. Food was rationed. Those without a sweet tooth gave their sugar rations to others. Ken and I drank tea, for it was better than the coffee essence. Over breakfast we read newspapers. Each consisted of four or, at the most, six pages. <p> September 15, 1941 : Leningrad cut off by German troops. <p> February 12, 1942 : Three German cruisers made it through the Strait of Dover. <p> May 28th : The Wehrmacht has taken two hundred and fifty thousand Soviet prisoners at Kharkov. <p> The Nazis, Ken said, are making the same mistake as Napoleon. They underestimate the power of General Winter. He was right, of course. In late November, General Paulus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February they surrendered to General Zhukov. <p> One morning in April, 1943, Ken told me about a London radio broadcast, made the day before, by General Sikorski, the Polish Prime Minister in exile, who was appealing to Poles in Poland to support the ongoing uprising in the Warsaw ghetto. The ghetto was being systematically annihilated. Sikorski said( I remember Ken 's speaking slowly), " The greatest crime in the history of mankind is taking place. " <p> Only during moments when you found yourself thinking about nothing did the enormity of what was happening make itself felt. The enormity was then present in the air, under the spring sky, addressing a seventh sense which I still can not name. <p> Beneath the damask bedcover, during nights punctuated by air-raid sirens, I sometimes felt a burning in Ken 's erect member. The tumescence came unasked and waited like a pain, a pain that had to be stanched, low down in the middle of his long body. Soon afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes without glasses, sleep came swiftly to the two of us. Rippled sleep, like sand, when the tide was far out. <p> Let 's go and see the pigeons, Ken says, polishing the thick lenses of his glasses with his tartan handkerchief. <p> We walk toward the northern end of the market. The sun is hot. One more early-summer morning added to the pile on the century 's desk. We watch two butterflies, which came to the center of the city with the garden vegetables, fly upward in a spiral. The clock on the city cathedral strikes eleven. <p> Every day, hundreds of Polish visitors climb the spiral stone staircase in the bell tower of the cathedral to touch the massive tongue of the Zygmunt bell, cast in 1520 and weighing eleven tons. Touching the bell, it is said, brings luck in love. <p> We pass a man selling hair dryers. A hundred and fifty zlotys each ; they have probably been stolen. He is demonstrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child, Come here, sweetie, and I 'll make you look cool! <p> The girl laughs, agrees, and her hair is fluffed up, billowing. Sliczna! she cries. I 'm beautiful. Ken translates, laughing. <p> Farther on, I see a crowd of men huddled together. They are so still that they seem to be listening to music. When we get closer, I see that in fact they are gathered around a table on which there are pigeons in wooden pens, five or six to a cage, maybe a hundred of them. The birds vary in plumage and size, although all have a glint of bluish slate in their coloring. In this glint there is something of the sky above Krakow. The pigeons on the table look like sky samples brought back to earth. <p> Nobody knows, Ken says, how homing pigeons find their way home. When they are flying in clear weather, they can see thirty kilometres ahead, yet this does n't explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris in 1870, a million messages to the city 's inhabitants were delivered by fifty pigeons. It was the first time ever that microphotography was used on that sort of scale. The letters were all reduced, so that hundreds could fit on a tiny film weighing only a gram or two. Then, when the pigeons arrived, the letters were enlarged, copied out, and delivered. Collodion film and carrier pigeons -- strange how things come together! <p> Some birds have been taken out of their cages and are being expertly examined by pigeon fanciers. The birds are lightly pinched between two fingers, the length of their legs is measured, the flat tops of their heads lightly pressed by a thumb, their flight feathers extended, and all the while they are being held tightly against the men 's chests, like trophies. <p> Ken takes my arm. It 's hard, do n't you think, to imagine sending news of a total catastrophe by carrier pigeon? The message could announce a defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in that gesture of throwing the pigeon up into the sky, so that it heads for home, there is inevitably a hope, is n't there? Sailors from ancient Egypt used to release pigeons from their boats on the high seas to announce to their families that they were on their way home. <p> I wonder how the chess game is going, I say. The two of us stroll to the other end of the market. <p> There are sixteen pieces left on the board. Zedrek has king, bishop, and five pawns. He is looking up at the sky, as if seeking inspiration. <p> Abram looks at his watch. Twenty-three minutes! he announces. <p> Chess is not a game you can hurry, a customer comments. <p> He has one good move, whispers Ken, and I bet he 's not going to see it. <p> Move the bishop to C5, is that it? <p> No, you idiot, his king to F1. <p> Tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! <p> Hearing him say these words, I suffer his death. He, meanwhile, takes his head in his hands, and with them he turns the head left and right, as if it were a searchlight. He waits for me to laugh, as I often did at this clown act of his. He does n't see my anguish. I do laugh, and I suffer his death. For the first time. <p> When I came out of the Army at the end of the war, he had disappeared. I wrote to him at the last address I had, and there was no reply. A year later, he sent a postcard to my parents -- the postcard came from somewhere improbable, like Iceland or Jersey -- asking whether we might all spend Christmas together, which we did. He came with a woman, a war photographer who was, I think, Czech. We played Christmas games, we laughed a lot, he teased my mother about buying all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us there was the same complicity. Neither of us looked away or took the slightest step back. We felt the same love : simply the circumstances had changed. The passeur had delivered his charge ; the frontiers were crossed. <p> The years passed. The last time I saw him, we drove all night with a friend of mine, from London to Geneva. In a forest near Chatillon-sur-Seine, we heard Coltrane playing " My Favorite Things " on the radio. It was during this journey that Ken told me he was returning to New Zealand. He was then sixty-five. I did n't ask him why, because I did n't want to hear him say : To die. <p> Instead, I made believe that he would come back to Europe. To which he replied, The best thing there, John, down under, is the grass! There 's no grass as green anywhere else in the world. He said this forty years ago. I never knew exactly when or how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stolen hair dryers, the honey cake with candied orange peel, Jagusia with her basket now almost empty, the black cherries that have to be sold and eaten quickly because they wo n't last, the barrel of salted herring, the voice of Ewa Demarczyk on a CD, singing one of her defiant songs, I suffer his death for the first time. <p> I do not even glance back at where Ken is standing, for he will not be there. Something pulls me back to the pigeons. I walk alone, past the barber 's and the soup kitchen and the women sitting on their stools. <p> When I arrive, a man turns toward me and, as if guessing my distress -- is there another country in the world more habitually accustomed to coming to terms with that emotion? -- he hands me, without smiling, the carrier pigeon he is holding. <p> Its feathers feel slightly damp -- like satin. The small ones on its breast have a parting in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its feathers are cool. It weighs nothing for its size. If I tilt it in the sunlight, its dun-corn color changes for a second into a bluish silver. I hold it against my chest. <p> I left the Plac Nowy, and found, after asking two passersby, the bank machine. From there I returned to the pension in Miodowa Street and lay down on the bed. It was very hot, hot with the uncertain heat of the eastern plains. Now I could weep. I shut my eyes and imagined shuffling a pack of cards. <p>
