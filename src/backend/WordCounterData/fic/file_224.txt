4162241 He looked at me the next morning and his eyes were the color of melted copper. The sun was streaming in through my curtainless window behind his head and it seemed for a moment almost as though he was hoping to give me a new name, so far seeking and impenetrable was his expression. I looked put the window with his eyes on me. I did n't realize how long your hair is, he said, though I knew he was thinking something else. It must come down to the middle of your back. But he was thinking something else. He had seen it down -- my hair -- at the gay har the night before. There were few places to go and so we were there every day that week. It was the day after the storm : even the Palace Casino had not reopened, and there were no restaurants. The governor had not yet begun his weekly visits, had not yet given his pronouncement : We will rebuild this coast. The Army had not yet come ; the reporters still were unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were also not many places for us to go. Before the storm we would call ourselves The Mississippi Gays because it sounded so much like The Mississippi Greys and we were all in love somehow with the mottled history of our state. In love mostly with the idea of a unifying call, some urgent and necessary event imposing its irrefutable obligation on us all. But with Katrina it seemed that everything changed. The center of the bar was destroyed and the full structure itself was unstable, but we came as we would have always done, so many of us, to drink beside the washed-out patio. We came that first night and there was of course no electricity, all of us carrying from our own storehouses of liquor and ice, in radiant confederacy, united through the late hours of our common peril. The owner was never very social, interested only in profit and thrift, but that night he seemed deeply moved. He managed to make it in through the cracked and warped hack door to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what-had-been-roof, reaching and reaching across the broken counter where in early evenings he would count his money while we watched. We thought he was going to bring us what liquor remained, perhaps share it in the solidarity that had become our new fashion, but instead he grabbed an armful of glasses, as many as he could hold, and carefully brought them back across the broken threshold and passed them out. Whatever you can reach is yours to drink, he said, smiling magnanimously. We cheered : true, abundant happiness. In the end it was something of a cynical ploy for expedited cleanup. We had already exhausted most of our own stores, and the hundred or so bottles of variously priced liquor against the unbroken mirrored wall had somehow remained almost entirely unmolested by the roof that had collapsed nearby. The ploy was both merciful and self-purposing : we united quickly in our unassailable drunken logic to clear out the large, unwieldy broken door, then to create a chain of willing cleanup workers, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger led the charge with bravado ; the weaker cleared the broken glass and other shattered elements of the former roof. And before long there was a clear pathway to the bar, and the roof was scattered in unruly pieces in the stillfloodedparking lot, the dancefloor 's former covering now a moonroof opening onto the warped and marbled counter. But even in our rush and liquor-lust, no one approached the bottles until everyone was inside, and then it was simple, each of us retiring to his tastes, I to gin and he to vodka, sharing from the same small cooler of ice that one of the older patrons had brought, and there were no fresh mixers and yet everything was as beautiful as it had ever been, the moon and unnamed constellations casting down on us their benevolent August starlight. I took my hair down and as I poured my drink he came up to me and commented I do n't believe I 've ever seen anyone drink straight gin. I was unsure if it was critique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that place, eight days before we would regain electricity, fifteen days before it would again rain, two months before the roof would be replaced, to discern anyone 's motivation. I said to him, believing myself to be clever, I do n't beheve I 've ever seen anyone who 's never seen anyone drink straight gin. He was unimpressed and it seemed that I had lost my chance. He turned his head and I was afraid he was S48 I Southwest Review leaving, so I touched his arm and said Would you like to try it, but in fact he was not leaving, only looking behind him by instinct for a barstool to sit on. But they were gone. He gave a small shudder, either from the prospect of undiluted gin or from this reminder of the sea 's long reach. He tried the gin and hated it instantaneously, and for that reaction I afforded him tremendous virtue. He would be incapable of lying. And so that next morning, when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hair is, I recognized that he was, in fact, capable of lying, though it seemed to me he would do so only in necessary circumstances. I was certain he was thinking something else. I said, in reply, quite stupidly, I 've had it like this for a very long time, and he did not respond, and in the sunstreams were dancing a thousand particles of dust. I was glad to have him in my bed. He said to me the night prior, after tasting my gin, / ca n't imagine why in God 's name you would drink this. I said, again hoping to be clever, I never drink in God 's narne. He seemed not to understand, digesting my words with a great deal of effort the way the gin itself had had to settle, and so I changed the subject to the one item of conversation that was circulating untrammeled through the room like a simultaneous affliction of illness. How did your place end upf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drink. Half of the building is still there, but my apartment was on the bottom floor. I nodded. So it 's flooded, I said. Yes, he said. Everything but the dishes and the steaks I had in the freezer. He set his empty glass on the bar. Everyone in the room seemed pleased with the world. There was weariness and fearfulness and sorrow, but in the end we had all found each other again. We had lined up near the mouth of our brokenfaced and communal home and cleared its belly of the wet signals of destruction. And there we stood, our gladness the greater for its proximity to dying. I realized what felt so strange -- aside from the true stars illuminating -- was that there was no music. There were only the varying cadences of our words alongside the numinous chattering of the crickets being sent out into this space : our bodies still while our minds raced. He stood before me and I was unsure if I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this single occasion. But he was there, in any case, his eyes gleaming like tawny portals to another earth. He had stopped speaking ; I was thinking of that other earth. There was so much brightness and rejoicing beside us that our silence seemed to ring out indecent against it. I said to him, as much to hear his answer as to break the wordless void. Where will you sleep tonight! He reached behind him to the counter to refill his glass, answering with his head turned away from mine. I 'm not sure. He poured from the bottle and turned back. / could stay with you. Before answering I looked down to my drink, the color of it shining like the liquid remnant of a melted star. Here was the meaning, after everything, the answer to the question the storm had asked. All right, I said. We can open the windows, but it 'll still be hot. By the third day after the storm we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cross on the unmarked street corners, corralling us into long lines of harried and weary citizens. Here was that unifying call : all of us unable to repent, the roads cohered in tree limbs and concrete and sand, the gas stations washed away. He walked with me to the nearest line, the aid workers calling plaintively There 's plenty thirty minutes of waiting in the new September sunlight we were at the table where they sat on recovered plastic folding chairs, asking for our addresses and names. What they wrote on was also recovered, giving the infuriating loud warble of once-wet and now-dried paper. The woman took our IDS, looked for the address, and smiled. Here you go, she said. One small hox for each of us, marked Him. There was an individually wrapped disposable razor and a travel size can of shaving cream. Beside it were a plastic yellow toothbrush and whitening toothpaste, along with a small package of tissues. The food was in pulltop lidded cans. We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rattled on. This was before the Army came, days later, their engines and mounted military guns rumbling loudly through the streets. The streetsigns were all broken and scattered then, and when the soldiers came they would ask me sometimes for directions. But I knew only the street names themselves, not the number of blocks remaining, and so I was unhelpful. But on the third day -- before the Army, with only the Red Cross -- we took our small boxes and walked back along Division Street toward SSO / Southwest Review my building. Though we were content to be with each other, the boredom was unrelenting. The heat, too, was wearying. We dropped off the boxes and I locked the door -- every night the police warned us, from a loudspeaker driving past, of lootings -- and walked back to the road. The sun shone from the azure sky in glorious burning. I leally wish, he said, that I could just charge my phone. I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have a generator. Maybe we can tiy the Wal-Mait, I said. It was a long walk but we had nothing else to do. The streets were mostly empty, aside from the unimaginable volume of debris, and so for the only time in my life I held the hand of a boy while we walked in daylight through the Biloxi streets. It felt more dangerous than the storm itself and I was thinking : I 'd do eveiything again foi this. After two hours we arrived, sweatstained and exhausted. Again there were the Red Gross lines, again the harried crowd wavered between capitulation and outrage. We looked out on our unfamiliar neighbors, all of us too poor or foolish to have left when we had the chance. This was our remaining portion. The store itself was closed and guarded, but there was a small pocket of people sitting in a line near the entrance. At the front, seated, was a woman in her forties, soaking in the heat. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theii geneiatois to make ice. She wiped her face with the inside of her shirt. It seemed pointless, like deploying a wet rag to dry the sea. While it 's on, she continued, he said we can chaige oui phones. There were only two plugs, one of which was being used to make the ice, and in the sudden gratitude that gripped us we did not think to ask for more. Each peison gets fifteen minutes, she said. I 'm about done. There were four people behind her, so I sat down and we waited in the shade. After an hour it was his turn. He moved to the front of the line while I sat beside him. While his phone was charging we were unable to speak. It was as though any words would be taken directly from the battery 's weak charge. When our time was over we walked through the parking lot and he called his mother. He walked ahead of me and I heard only small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase You do n't sound veiy lelieved. Then it was through. We walked back to my apartment and this time he put his hand around my waist in the empty street, even though it was daylight, even though we were sodden with perspiration, even Newberry I though he seemed for the first time in the few days I had known him to he unhappy. He played Billie Holiday on his phone while we walked under the cloudless sky and. for a few moments it was as though the storm had never come. His hand on my waist in the living day was an electric infusion. I was filled with such gratitude and gladness that I forgot to call my own parents. On Caillavet Street, finally nearing my home, his phone gave final report of its dying. We were set free. Each night for the first weekwe went to the bar, and within four days every portion of alcohol had been consumed. There was no ice to be had and it was difficult to even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were unsure how the others lived, or where they stayed, hut each evening he and I returned. He stayed with me during the day, and each night after leaving we came back to my apartment, sweltering and longsuffering in our desire. On the fourth night there were no drinks and there was nowhere to purchase them, and so we sat on the floor and talked among ourselves, sober and unmercifully heated by the summer 's remainder. One of the other patrons had brought marijuana and so the night progressed with a different hue. We sat in a circle -- the whole group of us, maybe twenty strong -- and passed our stories on the floor like winter recipes at the beginning of harvest. Stories of warning and regret, and still sometimes they were stories of unapologetic and fearless love. The night seemed very long. He sat beside me and when the energy of the circle was dissipating he motioned that we should step outside. I walked behind him and heard for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surely it was something else, since the tracks had all heen broken. On the remnant of the patio he said what he must have been planning to say all evening : // the power ever comes back on, I 'll write your name out in lights. He said this with an air of triumph, as if in saying it alone it would come true. Both his hands were cupping my face, holding my head like a great fragile jewel in the air. It was difficult to picture -- his promise -- so penetrating and complete was the darkness. The full descent of night had never heen so real for me as in that week, and I wanted in a way for there to never be artificial light again. But it was beautiful to be told such a thing, and so I kissed him. You 'll need a lot of lights, I said. We went back to the circle and the energy of the long evening had reconstituted itself. An older man was speaking then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said, without bitterness. For us things were a lot different. When he was nineteen he married a bright haired girl at the First Baptist Church in Ocean Springs. They were too poor for much of a honeymoon and so they took a train to New Orleans. This was 1955. By that night he had already stolen away from their hotel room in search of the city 's rumored gatherings of homosexuals. He found them without much difficulty. Every year for our anniversary we 'd go back, he said. We always took the train. The bar owner began to speak then. I vnsh I 'd had a place like this when I was young. He was sitting with his legs crossed on the small stage, slightly above us. His father had discovered him in bed with a neighborhood boy at the age of fourteen and beaten him so savagely that he stayed in the hospital for two days. In those days, he said, doctors did n't care what parents did to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orleans with the intention of working long enough to save the money required to properly murder his father. But in the intervening years his ambition changed, his heart settled and unsettled by the men he had loved. I came back in 1984 and started this bar. He smiled weakly in the darkness. It 's the only good thing It was the fourth night after Katrina, and it seemed we could speak only of the past. But who could blame us? Outside our cracking walls were other cracking walls : the earth itself broken to its liquid center. There had been so much water in the course of the storm that I imagined it would never be fully gone. We were sitting in a circle while the sea drained in the night beside us. There was much to avoid. I stood up and again left the circle. They were all talking quietly. I walked to the useless bar and looked into the mirror. It was unbroken but my reflection was cloudy. The salt was thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put his arm on my waist. Do n't worry, he said, everyone looks beautiful in moonlight. This was untrue. But I was grateful for the sentiment, grateful for his hot hand in the hot midnight world. It seemed that everything had been taken and given back in a new configuration : every broken object had cast its spirit and collective memory into the sky while the storm rumbled merci-less above us. And the spirits and the memories mixed and unfolded themselves among our remaining hearts. You know, I said, / stayed in my apartment during the storm. He put his hands on the counter. It 's not far from the bay, but it 's on high ground. I sighed. I was n't very worried. I had not wanted to stay alone, and so I huddled in my still-lighted hallway with the elderly woman from next door. She was cheery despite her arthritis, despite the eventual complete darkness when the power was lost, despite the rampaging wind that sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war. I did not believe she had been in London during the war, but there was no sense in saying it. It was, perhaps, that she had realized too late that we were dying, that the warnings had not, in fact, been false alarms. We listened to hundred-year-old oaks shattering in the black night, and perhaps she decided that it was better to believe she had lived a fuller life. My father was English, she said. There was a small battery-powered lantern that illuminated our stolid faces. We made it through those years of bombings, she said, and then only when it was all over did they decide that we should move here. She had no trace of an English accent. We had never spoken more than ten words to each other. The small lamplight burned on and cast our indigo shadows across the undecorated walls. Now there was only the sound of rain, its umrelenting steadiness like a sheet of nails being hammered into the gateposts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. She sat precariously on the floor, as I imagined she had not done in years, her thin bones seeming to emerge in the shadow she cast against the wall. My father always said it was the best decision he ever made. I told this to him with his hands on the purposeless bar, and then he looked at me as though I had revealed some meaningful secret history. I only just got out in time, he said. I knew that this was all he would say about it. His hands were flat, stretched on the counter, tapping lightly. He looked behind him, taking in the room and its contents, nervous but not unhappy, seeming almost to expect that it would never change. The others continued in the hum of their indifference. I wanted to ask where he had been when the water came in to gather him away. But I knew better than to ask. We were tired ; the night had been long. We had still to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind to return. He looked to my 554 I Southwest Review reflection : How long, he said, until we go! The lanterns someone had placed in the corners of the room were burning while he waited, and his reflection in the seadust then was more beautiful than it had been before. Our mute flickering shadows spread everywhere among us in that shattered place. For a moment it seemed we all were necessary, our hopes combining like recirculated air. I 'm ready, I told him, if you are. We walked out the opening where the door had been. There still were no streetlights, there still were no cars. Even the dark unpopulated bay was free of passengers. Maybe it 'll rain tonight, he said, taking my hand. I could almost hear him smiling in the darkness. God knows we could use it.
