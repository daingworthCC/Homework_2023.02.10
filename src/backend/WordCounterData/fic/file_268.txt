" # The priest was half-sitting up beneath the white sheets, fat face flushed, his eyes rolling frantically in their sockets. # " Are you all right, Father? " # " Yes, daughter, I 'm fine. But it was a horrible nightmare. The Devil was chasing me through a cemetery, and as I ran I kept stepping on skulls. Tiny children 's skulls that broke under my feet. " # " Horrible! Lie back down, there you go. " # Little by little, his breathing slowed. The taut muscles of his face relaxed, and he let his great white head fall back to the pillow. # He looked around the room while the nurse arranged his sheets. It was spacious, with a large window open on gardens in shadow. The tree leaves were whispering outside, swayed by a nocturnal wind that carried sweet summer smells, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reproduction of Botticelli 's Nativity that hung facing the bed. In shadows barely broken by the bedside light, the Virgin Mary seemed ghoulish, a mournful being from beyond the grave. He averted his gaze. The nurse hovered at his side, watching him closely. # " I 'm all right now. If you could just hand me my water bottle, please. " # " You need rest. I do n't know if I 'm allowed to give you anything for the pain, but maybe a mild sedative? " # " No, it 's fine. It 's... right. I know the doctors have forbidden any painkillers. We can only pray for God 's mercy. " # " It 's not a punishment, you know. " # Father Augustine shut his eyes. The nurse, a young nun with Peruvian features, studied him a few seconds more. Then she turned to the monitor at the head of the bed. The screen illuminated at her touch, showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensor in the priest 's forearm. # She checked over his vitals and turned the screen back off. " Should I leave the bedside light on? " # " For a few minutes, sister, so I can say an Our Father and fall back asleep to thoughts of the Savior. " # " As you wish, Father. " # " Thank you. " # The nun left the room with small silent steps. Father Augustine murmured the prayer over and over again, pushing the obsidian beads of a rosary through his fat fingers. The beads caught the lamplight as they moved, reflecting it blurrily onto the bare walls like glowing ants marching single file. # Before long, the throbbing pain in his kidneys returned. It had tortured him all night. He shifted his weight on the mattress, a task made difficult by his immense fleshy belly, but only managed to move the pain to the other side of his back. # Minutes ticked by, the end of each prayer running into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off. He breathed in and out. When he spoke again his voice was charged with emotion. It was the same voice that he 'd once used, amplified by all the air in his lungs, to deliver sermons-the only part of the liturgy he 'd truly loved. # " Father in Heaven, you know how to pardon what mortal men can not. I feel that they 're wrong to do this to me, to impose this penance. It 's not redemption. It 's a punishment dictated by blind men, an abomination that offends your Word and your infinite love. I 've repented, I 've prayed till my tongue bleeds, and now I wait on bended knee for your pardon, for the balm of your mercy to heal all the wounds of this sinner 's soul. # How can men dare interfere with your forgiveness? I beg you not to let them. If I 'm wrong, if this is the chalice you 've chosen for me, why do n't I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without redemption, without end. My God, take me in your arms and give me your pardon. " # He repeated his plea over and over in various forms, various tones : humble, fervent, resigned. Finally, the priest fell back asleep in his bed in Rome 's Christ the King Hospital. # His prayer went unanswered. As soon as he closed his eyes, he was back in the nightmare, back in the endless graveyard where he was hunted by a pack of hounds that did not bark. Instead he heard the jagged-glass laughter of a thousand children, frenzied, aggressive, unrelenting. He dreamed it over and over again, those small unstable bodies surrounding him, hurling at him. Rows of sharp baby teeth sinking into his pale flesh, a surge of pain and spurting blood. # Out of all the children who chased him, one stood out from the gloom. He could see her innocent blue eyes, her angelic smile, and he recognized her. As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the depths of the nightmare, unable to stop, unable to wake up. # In the morning he woke, once more without having rested. It was daybreak. The cool night air had not yet sunk into the earth, and a pleasant breeze came through the window. He switched on the small television in the comer of the room. A narrator spoke softly as the camera panned across a summer landscape-a nature program. # With no small difficulty, he got out of bed and walked to the bathroom. Leaning on the sink, he looked at himself in the mirror. He was unsurprised to see deep purple rings under his eyes, a face swollen from fluid retention, puffy lips and a pronounced double chin. His breath came short again. # The nature program had ended. Different voices spoke now. He realized, as he rinsed his mouth, that he was hearing a press conference from Vatican City. # " This meeting discussed an increase in the yearly funding supplied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We think our request is a fair one, as do the signatory states of our international agreement. The Catholic Church has been instrumental in liberating Western society from a very serious moral and judicial dilemma. It 's only right that we receive economic support in return. " # As he grunted on the toilet, trying to make the first deposit of the day, he recognized the voice as that of Monsignor Castafiore, the cardinal in charge of Economic Affairs of the Holy See, a sharp-toothed old fox that even the Pope was said to be scared of. # Finally, a journalist raised the question Father Augustine had been waiting for. # " Many critics claim a secret part of the agreement precludes further sexual abuse lawsuits made against Catholic priests from going to court. " # " Absolutely not, miss. This accusation has been made many times in the past. The truth is that we have &iquest;ways allowed for issues, like those mentioned, to be solved in civil court. The insinuation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Church is nothing but anti-Catholic fear-mongering, crude, and quite frankly, unoriginal. They 've been accusing us of the same since... " # The last words were lost to the sound of the toilet flushing. When he could hear the television again, the news was over. The Vatican channel, which was the only one available, was now playing a documentary on brave missionaries combating Third World poverty. # Father Augustine turned off the television and welcomed the silence. # He ate breakfast looking out the window, watching the sun climb into Rome 's clear sky. Little by little the gray leaves of the ashes and aspens regained their color, then, as the sun 's rays hit them full-on, burst into bright vivid green. # He tried not to look at the painting across from him, but it was no use. Botticelli 's Virgin fixed him again with a gaze that held too many things. For a moment Father Augustine thought of asking someone to remove the picture, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known how to explain his uneasiness. # When they took away his breakfast tray, he dressed on his own, puffing like a wounded walrus. He was spurred along by the sight of the hour on his wristwatch. His only clothes were black shirts and clerical collars, enormous trousers, and a pair of shoes that no longer fit his swollen feet. He 'd long since substituted them for hospital clogs. # No one stopped him from leaving. He walked every morning on the doctor 's orders. Outside in the gardens, spring was in full force. Everything was being born : the grass, the leaves, the insects. Even the heavy stones around the flowerbeds seemed intent on blooming, covered as they were in a thick cloak of moss. Father Augustine walked the gravel path with the aid of a cane, letting himself be enveloped in the musty scent of the small ponds, the cool touch of the shade, and the smell of grass freshly cut by the gardener. # Before long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble breathing. Flies, wasps, and mosquitoes buzzed around him at speed. The nascent spring sun was not yet hot, but his thick black clothing and the weight of his belly conspired to leave him sweating all the same. # For a moment he wondered if all this had been a good idea, or if perhaps it would be better to turn around, go back to suffering in his bed. No. The Church authorities had brought this on themselves. They had made decisions that were not theirs to make, superseding the Most High with their scheming, with their treaties and secret agreements. # He kept going and found who he was looking for sitting on a poplar-shaded bench beneath the statue of St. Jeremiah. He smiled ruefully to himself. St. Jeremiah was the prophet the Israelites had stoned to death for showing them their own evils. Nothing good could come from this meeting. # Father Augustine walked over. He collapsed, more than sat, on the warm wood of the bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other. Father Augustine took a handkerchief from his jacket and used it to wipe the sweat from his forehead. # The man stared straight ahead as he spoke. # " Soon it 'll really be getting hot. " # " Yes, and me with this gut. It wo n't be pretty. " # The man nodded. " Are you ready, then? " # " I am, so long as I remain anonymous. So long as the money is ready for me in Switzerland. " # " Do n't worry about anonymity. What can they do to you? Once this is blown open, you 'll be untouchable. " # " You do n't know them. You 're one of these modern people. One of these atheists who thinks the Catholic Church is obsolete, ineffective, on its way out. " # " I wo n't lie. I think it survives on trickery and Third World faithfuls. Here in Europe, the message does n't take like it used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to hear what I have to say. " # Father Augustine shifted on the bench, moving one hand to his knee, so his belly hung more comfortably and took the strain off his back. He studied the journalist through narrowed eyes. Up until now, they had only spoken through the old phone Father Augustine had hidden in his clothing. # He was a man old enough to be patient, but not old enough to have learned to be afraid. Beneath his mirrored sunglasses, his face was anodyne, ordinary, instantly forgettable apart from the suggestion of a smile hanging at the corner of his mouth. # That unborn smile bothered Father Augustine. He imagined it would be condescending and cruel. But that was only an intuition, and even if it were true, he did n't need to worry himself about the opinion of an atheist, much less a journalist. He leaned back against the bench, searching for the deepest part of the poplar 's cool shadow, and began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called within the Church. The legal term refers to orphans born into their care, under their legal guardianship before they even leave the womb. " # " I know that. " # " You do n't know all the implications. Like most educated people, you 've ignored the Church and its evolution over the past few decades. " # The reporter shifted to face him on the bench. He 'd caught his attention. # " In Europe, children of the welfare system, or of its subsequent alternatives, stopped believing. It 's been the unsolvable problem, one the Church did n't address until it realized the new generation needed to be pastored by apostles of their own age, or close to it. Unfortunately, the advances of atheism and a consumer society had left the seminaries empty. # Then providence brought us John Paul IV, who found the solution in medical science. Ever since he established the homes, ever since the government allowed the Church legal guardianship over the postnasciturus, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduate from the seminaries every year to fill the churches in Europe and all over the world. " # The reporter leaned back on the bench, no longer looking at him. " There are plenty of investigations into the Church 's brainwashing techniques. Plenty of people have tried to change things, to rescue them, but the Holy See 's legal claim over these young people is rock solid. That information is not worth the money you 're asking for. " # " I know, but that 's not the end of it. Have you looked at the numbers like I told you to do? The statistics? " # " Yes, and the results were disturbing. That 's why I came. " # " What is the percentage? " # " Unwanted pregnancies have doubled in the past five years. " # " That number ca n't be explained away by pregnancies that would have been hidden in the past, or by mistakes in the records. It 's real. " # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves us. " # " If you read the papal notices, if you saw the day-to-day routine of a parish, you would realize. Religion is for the poor, for the downtrodden, for the ones nobody cares about. " # " And? " # " The fight against the use of condoms and contraceptives has become more than furious fanaticism. The Church encourages relations between young parishioners and has removed any calls to chastity, any threats of hellfire and brimstone for the ones who have sex before marriage. Priests, from the pulpit, are now troubadours praising carnal love. Not the fearsome ascetics of decades past. # " Do n't you see the connection? It 's simple. More couples, uninhibited and uninformed, means more pregnancies. More children for the seminaries, more future parishioners. " # The reporter stood up from the bench. The sun lit him from behind and turned his face to silhouette. " What you 're suggesting is monstrous. " # Father Augustine lowered his gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pain that would sharpen if he did n't change position. He let it grow. He had no strength. He was tired of suffering, of fighting. But when he closed his eyes he heard the piercing chorus of children 's voices. The pain in his back grew worse, a serrated knife struggling to saw him in two. # Finally he grasped his belly with both hands and shifted himself on the bench. The pain ebbed. He rubbed his palms on his trouser legs. He hated touching his gut with his hands, feeling it so heavy and full of flesh and fluids. The journalist sat back down. His expression had lost any hint of a smile ; now his mouth twisted down, a rictus of disgust. # " I 'm going to need proof. " # " I have no proof except myself. " # " What? " # " I 'm a postnasciturus. I was raised in an institution and passed from there to the seminary. As a priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my first mother attended. Found it in the old legal transfer records. I tracked her down. I investigated her life, her circumstances. Thanks to that, I came to realize the Church 's strategy. So obvious, now, but unnoticed for so long. This paper has her information. You can go speak with her, she 's not so old yet. She was nearly a child when she conceived me. " Father Augustine leaned forward, grasping the journalist 's arm with meaty fingers. " She does n't know that I 'm her son, and I do n't want her to find out. " # The journalist pulled his arm away. He got to his feet, looked around. Then he slipped the note into his pocket and left without a word. Father Augustine stayed seated on the bench, with neither the desire nor the strength to return to the hospital, to the dull empty room where his life elapsed. # That night he dreamed again, as he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore a chasuble, as if to give Mass. He was behind the altar of Santa Maria, his parish. The church 's only light came streaming through a skylight, a golden river that cut through darkness and made the pews ' ancient patina burst into splinters of light. Floor tiles full of cracks and carvings, columns and arches of old Roman stone : all of it illuminated, precise and terrifying, by the warm golden light. # He walked slowly over the uneven tiles, through the aisle between the pews. The nave of the church of Santa Maria de Pergamo surrounded him, an intercostal space of plaster and granite. # He breathed deeply and inhaled the familiar smells of old wood, burnt incense, faint must from the crypts. But a strange darkness seemed to flow now from the base of the candles on the altar, dripping like wax to the floor, engulfing the light. # Maybe that was why he saw only blurred silhouettes sitting in the pews. As he approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He moved nimbly, unencumbered. His limbs felt light. His heart pounded in his chest. For a second, he thought of fleeing, leaving through the back door of the church, bathing in the quiet sunlight outside. He would find a little plaza, far from the traffic, and sit at a terrace table shaded by old linden trees. # Suddenly that was the only thing he wanted in all the world : to sit at one of those tables and order a latte and a napolitana. He tried to turn toward the door, but the darkness clung to his ankles, keeping him in place. Eyes watched him from the pews, many small heads turning to him. # Children 's laughter. He could n't see their smiles, but he could imagine them : uneven teeth, small, sharp, ready to lacerate his flesh. The panic of all the other dreams, all the other nightmares, came rushing back. # " Leave me alone! Leave me alone! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of night. This time the nurse did n't come to check on him. It was late, and the room was saturated in a silence found only in hospitals in the early morning, the sort that devoured all sounds and any hope of dawn. # He had trouble falling asleep again. The empty room felt threatening. He tried not to look at the painting but could still feel the ghostly Mary 's unconvinced gaze, half suffering, half reproachful. # At last he fell into a dreamless sleep that lasted until the creaking of the breakfast cart awoke him. He was dipping a magdalena into his coffee when his phone began to jump and vibrate on the bedside table. # He picked it up. " Are you... Did you do as I told you? Yes, same time. In the same place. " # Unlike the morning of their last meeting, the sky was overcast. Thick clouds, product of the previous days ' heat and humidity, hung heavily over Rome. Spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked his watch as he entered the tree-lined promenade. There was still plenty of time before they were due to meet. So, despite the hospital clogs torturing his swollen feet, he decided to extend his daily walk. # He heard the shouting long before he reached the main gate. Beyond the security checkpoint, he saw several carabinieri vans. Police armed with batons and riot shields faced a scant group of protestors. He could n't make out what they were chanting ; curious, he went closer. He realized his mistake when one of the protestors jabbed her finger at him, pointing. # " There 's one! Look at it! " # The police tightened their grips on their batons as the protestors turned red in the face, screaming : # " Free the postnasciturus! Free the nasciturus! Let mothers decide the fate of their children! " # They were recycled slogans he had heard a hundred times, a thousand times. He ducked out of sight behind the trunk of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old enough to have seen the glories of ancient, pagan Rome. # The shouting did n't stop. # Breathing hard, he put his hands to his belly, gripping the taut black cloth of his shirt that he 'd had to leave untucked like one of his teenage parishioners. He withdrew them again in revulsion and closed his eyes. The voices chanted on for a while but soon grew feeble. # He arrived at the meeting point agitated, acutely aware of the sweat running down his back and soaking his shirt. The journalist was nowhere in sight. Father Augustine sat down on the bench as he had the day prior, this time lacking even the strength to take out his handkerchief and dry his forehead. His vision was cloudy, and his heart was galloping. # A stuttering breeze raised eddies in the dust. St. Jeremiah stared into nowhere from his perch, perhaps anticipating the next stone cast by an angry Israelite. # " Good morning. " # " Good morning. You snuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Those protestors. " # " I 've never really understood what they want. " # " They do n't know either. All they know is they do n't like how things are. Having one mother and then another, it changes the rules of the game. It 's legal abortion, like they 've always asked for, but achieved and legislated without them. " # " They pointed at me as I went by. Shouting how it 's the right of the first mothers to decide. " # " A lot of political groups have their identities wrapped up in the struggle. The fight. Give them what they want and they do n't know what to do with themselves. " # " I do n't see how they can view nasciturus reimplantation as evil. Would they rather the children die? Now we take them from those who do not want them and give them to those who do. " # " Then you agree with what they 're doing. " # " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it was n't so focused on the ends, rather than the means. The idea in itself is not bad. It saves lives. " # The journalist did n't answer, only looked at him with that smile of disdain, maybe disgust, back at the corner of his mouth. Father Augustine looked up at the cloudy sky. The light had diminished, as if his words had chased off the sun. When he spoke his voice came out small. # " The process is n't as bad as it seems. You need only a few months of treatments. They operate on you, they open your belly and implant the hormone pump, the altered stem cells. It takes three months to grow the uterus and the connective tissue that supports it. Another month to grow a crude umbilical cord ready to accept a fetus. " # " I can only imagine what it 's like for the recipient. " # " No, you ca n't imagine it. " Father Augustine raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until now. Now we can feel the hormones come and go like the tide, the bloating of the body, the need to vomit and piss every single hour. " # The journalist said nothing. The clouds thickened overhead. The only light that reached the garden was unfocused, weak and sickly. Both men covered their faces as the coming storm kicked up whirls of dust. # The journalist stood, seemingly unsure of where to put his hands. He took a few short steps away before he spoke, as if ready to flee the rain. # " I met with your first mother. Like you said, she 's not very old. Taking away the nasciturus was the best thing that could have happened to her. She studied. Became an architect. She works for the city now. " # " You 'll publish the report, then? You 've convinced your bosses? " # " There will be no report. " # " What? Why? " # The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His eyes were clear and seemed much younger than the wrinkles on his face. " I kept investigating. It was n't easy. If there 's anything the Church guards more jealously than the postnasciturus records, it 's the disciplinary records. " # Father Augustine squinted against the flying dust. Thunder shook the air ; the smell of ozone hit his nostrils. " I do n't understand. " # The journalist took a step toward him. " You do n't understand, you fucking pedophile? Ask for forgiveness and that 's enough, right? What do n't you understand? Why I killed the report? Let me explain. Yes, what they do with young women who want to abort is an abomination. Yes, solving the abortion dilemma caused a hundred new problems. But we ca n't bring that to light separate from your crimes, and many people would agree, they would applaud, the punishment the Church chose for you. Making you carry that postnasciturus in your gut until the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might even agree with it myself. " # Thunder boomed again. Lightning scuttled across the sky and heavy raindrops began to fall on the path, beating mercilessly against the young spring leaves. The journalist stood there as the rain soaked him, sunglasses still in hand, his eyes like scythes. # Father Augustine did n't meet his gaze. He bowed his head and began to pray, swaying back and forth on the bench. The journalist seemed to finally notice the rain. He turned and strode back down the path. As he left, a gale of wind tore through the trees and shrubs, all but uprooting them. # When the wind subsided, the clouds split open at last. The raindrops became a thick curtain of water hammering the ground. Father Augustine stayed dry only a moment longer before the leaves of the poplar tree overflowed onto him. # He did n't move. In seconds, he was drenched. He had no place to go-nowhere better, in any case. He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admonished, tried, condemned. # It was not a new sensation. He 'd felt the same for most of his life. It was only when he 'd worked in the parish, giving catechism to tiny angels, that he 'd found meaning in his wretched existence. # Now the most absolute terror overwhelmed him : perhaps God had not forgiven him because, despite everything, he had not truly repented of his sins. His eyes flew open. The murmur of the rain was the murmur of many voices inside his skull. At that moment, he understood. He knew that what he 'd done, he would do again ; that the very weight of his being would pull him back to those childish smiles, those innocent eyes, those small and clean unblemished bodies. # He was going to be the second mother of a child, something that was barely more than a pile of cells now, but when she was taken out of his body, she would move, breathe, open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him-and he knew they would not-he would hold her close to him. # In the rain, his tears went unnoticed. * # Eduardo Vaquerizo has published nine novels, including his Ignotus Award-winning series set in a steampunk Spanish empire( The Darkness Cycle), a near future dystopia( They Lie), an SF story about Hypatia of Alexandria( The Last Night of Hypatia of Alexandria) and a collection of his best short stories( Sweet Sixteen). # Rich Larson( translator) was born in Galmi, Niger, has studied in Rhode Island and worked in the south of Spain, and now lives in Ottawa, Canada.
