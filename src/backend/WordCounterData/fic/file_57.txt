1008841 NOVEL( EXCERPT Headnote A woman realizes she is being defined by everyone but herself Headnote IDENTITY AWAKENED We all have our own identities, but unfortunately, sometimes it is easier to let other people tell us who we are and what we want. Headnote THE STORY SO FAR As a teenager, Janie is forced into an unhappy marriage by her grandmother, who knows she is going to die soon and wants to ensure Janie 's future. Janie later runs away with Jody, a dynamic man who promises her the world. Here, at the grand opening of their store, Janie sees a new side of Jody. <p> JUST ABOUT TIME FOR THE COMMITTEE MEETING CALLED to meet on his porch next day, the first wagon load of lumber drove up and Jody went to show them where to put it. Told Janie to hold the committee there until he got back, he did n't want to miss them, but he meant to count every foot of that lumber before it touched the ground. He could have saved his breath and Janie could have kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first place everybody was late in coming ; then the next thing as soon as they heard where Jody was, they kept right on up there where the new lumber was rattling off the wagon and being piled under the big live oak tree. So that 's where the meeting was held with Tony Taylor acting as chairman and Jody doing all the talking. A day was named for roads and they all agreed to bring axes and things like that and chop out two roads running each way. That applied to everybody except Tony and Coker. They could carpenter, so Jody hired them to go to work on his store bright and soon the next morning. Jody himself would be busy driving around from town to town telling people about Eatonville and drumming up citizens to move there. Janie was astonished to see the money Jody had spent for the land come back to him so fast. Ten new families bought lots and moved to town in six weeks. It all looked too big and rushing for her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof, Jody had canned goods piled on the floor and was selling so much he did n't have time to go off on his talking tours. She had her first taste of presiding over it the day it was complete and finished. Jody told her to dress up and stand in the store all that evening. Everybody was coming sort of fixed up, and he did n't mean for nobody else 's wife to rank with her. She must look on herself as the bell-cow, the other women were the gang. So she put on one of her bought dresses and went up the new-cut road all dressed in wine-colored red. Her silken ruffles rustled and muttered about her. The other women had on percale and calico with here and there a headrag among the older ones. Nobody was buying anything that night. They did n't come there for that. They had come to make a welcome. So Joe knocked in the head of a barrel of soda crackers and cut some cheese. " Everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's mah treat. " Jody gave one of his big heh heh laughs and stood back. Janie dipped up the lemonade like he told her. A big tin cup full for everybody Tony Taylor felt so good when it was all gone that he felt to make a speech. " Ladies and gent'men, we'se come tuhgether and gethered heap tuh welcome tuh our midst one who has seen fit tuh cast in his lot amongst us. He did n't just come hisself neither. He have seen fit tuh bring his, er, er, de light uh his home, dat is his wife amongst us also. She could n't look no mo " better and no nobler if she wuz de queen uh England. It 's uh pledger fish her tuh be heap amongst us. Brother Starks, we welcomes you and all dat you have seen fit tuh bring amongst us-yo " below-ed wife, yo! store, yo " land- " A big-mouthed burst of laughter cut him short. <p> " Dat 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mist " Starks is uh smart man, we'se all willm- tuh acknowledge tuh dat, but de day he comes waggin " down de road wid two hunded acres uf land over his shoulder, Ah wants tuh be dere tuh see it. " Another big blow-out of a laugh. Tony was a little peeved at having the one speech of his lifetime ruined like that. " All y'all know what wuz meant. Ah do n't see how come " ' Cause you jump up tuh make speeches and do n't know how, " Lige said. " Ah wuz speakin " jus " all right befo " you stuck yo " bill in. " " Naw, you wuz n't, Tony. Youse way outa jurisdiction. You ca n't welcome uh man and his wife " thout you make comparison about Isaac and Rebecca at de well, else it do n't show de love between " em if you do n't. " Everybody agreed that that was right. It was sort of pitiful for Tony not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that. Some tittered at his ignorance. So Tony said testily, " If all them days goin-tuh cut de monkey is done cut it and through wid, we 'll thank Brother Starks fuh a respond. " So Joe Starks and his cigar took the center of the floor. " Ah thanks you all for yo " kind welcome and for extendiri tuh me de right hand uh fellowship. Ah kin see dat dis town is full uh union and love. Ah means tuh put mah hands tuh de plow heah, and strain every nerve tuh make dis our town de metropolis uh de state. So maybe Ah better tell yuh in case you do n't know dat if we expect tuh move on, us got tuh incorporate lak every other town. Us got tuh incorporate, and us got tuh have uh mayor, if things is tuh be done and done right. Ah welcome you all on behalf uh me and mah wife tuh dis store and tuh de other things tuh come. Amen. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of the floor when it stopped. " Brothers and sisters, since us ca n't never expect tuh better our choice, Ah move dat we make Brother Starks our Mayor until we kin see further. " " Second dat motion!!! " It was everybody talking at once, so it was no need of putting it to a vote. " And now we 'll listen tuh uh few words uh encouragement from Mrs. Mayor Starks. " The burst of applause was cut short by Joe taking the floor himself " Thank yuh fuh yd compliments, but mah wife do n't know nothin " " bout no speech-makin '. Ah never married her for nothin " lak dat. She 's uh woman and her place is in de home. " Janie made her face laugh after a short pause, but it was n't too easy. She had never thought of making a speech, and did n't know if she cared to make one at all. It must have been the way Joe spoke out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or another that took the bloom off of things. But anyway, she went down the road behind him that night feeling cold. He strode along invested with his new dignity, thought and planned out loud, unconscious of her thoughts. " De mayor of uh town lak dis ca n't lay round home too much. De place needs buildin " up. Janie, Ah 'll git hold uh somebody tuh help out in de store and you kin look after things whilst Ah drum up things otherwise. " " Oh Jody, Ah ca n't do nothing wid no store lessen youse there. Ah could maybe come in and help you when things git rushed, but- " " I god, Ah do n't see how come yuh ca n't. " Tai n't nothin " atall tuh hinder yuh if yuh got uh thimble full uh sense. You got tuh. Ah got too much else on mah hands as Mayor. Dis town needs some light right now. " " Unh hunk, it is uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is. Taint no use in scufflin " over all dese stumps and roots in de dark. Ah 'll call uh meetin " bout de dark and de roots right away. Ah'II sit on dis case first thing. " THE VERY NEXT DAY WITH MONEY OUT OF HIS own pocket he sent off to Sears, Roebuck and Company for the street lamp and told the town to meet the following Thursday night to vote on it. Nobody had ever thought of street lamps and some of them said it was a useless notion. They went so far as to vote against it, but the majority ruled. But the whole town got vain over it after it came. That was because the Mayor did n't just take it out of the crate and stick it up on a post. He unwrapped it and had it wiped off carefully and put it up on a showcase for a week for everybody to see. Then he set a time for the lighting and sent word all around Orange County for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men out to the swamp to cut the finest and the straightest cypress post they could find, and kept on sending them back to hunt another one until they found one that pleased him. He had talked to the people already about the hospitality of the occasion. " Y'all know we ca n't invite people to our town just dry long so. I god, naw. We got tuh feed " em something, and t'ai n't nothin " people laks better'n barbecue. Ah 'll give one whole hawg mah ownself. Seem lak all de rest uh y'all put tuhgether ought a be able tuh scrape up two mo '. Tell yo " womenfolks tuh do " round " bout some pies and cakes and sweet Oater gone. " That 's the way it went, too. The women got together the sweets and the men looked after the meats. The day before the lighting, they dug a big hole in back of the store and filled it full of oak wood and burned it down to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night to barbecue the three hogs. Hambo and Pearson had full charge while the others helped out with turning the meat now and then while Hambo swabbed it all over with the sauce. In between times they told stories, laughed and told more stories and sung songs. They cut all sorts of capers and whiffed the meat as it slowly came to perfection with the seasoning penetrating to the bone. The younger boys had to rig up the saw-horses with boards for the women to use as tables. Then it was after sun-up and everybody not needed went home to rest up for the feast. By five o'clock the town was full of every kind of a vehicle and swarming with people. They wanted to see that lamp lit at dusk. Near the time, Joe assembled everybody in the street before the store and made a speech. " Folkses, de sun is goin " down. De Sun-maker brings it up in de mornin ', and de Sun-maker sends it tuh bed at night. Us poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up nor to slow it down. All we can do, if we want any light after de settin " or befo " de risin ', is tuh make some light ourselves. So days how come lamps was made. Dis evenin " we'se all assembled heah tuh light uh lamp. Dis occasion is something for us all tuh remember tuh our dyin " day. De first street lamp in uh colored town. Lift yo " eyes and gaze on it. And when Ah touch de match tuh dat lampwick let de light penetrate inside of yuh, and let it shine, let it shine, let it shine. Brother Davis, lead us in a word uh prayer. Ask uh blessin " on dis town in uh most particular manner. While Davis chanted a traditional prayer-poem with his own variations, Joe mounted the box that had been placed for the purpose and opened the brazen door of the lamp. As the word Amen was said, he touched the lighted match to the wick, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk in de light, de beautiful light Come where the dew drops of mercy shine bright Shine all around us by day and by night Jesus, the light of the world. They, all of them, all of the people took it up and sung it over and over until it was wrung dry, and no further innovations of tone and tempo were conceivable. Then they hushed and ate barbecue. When it was all over that night in bed Jody asked Janie, " Well, honey, how yuh lak being Mrs. Mayor? " " It 's all right Ah reckon, but do n't yuh think it keeps us in uh kinda strain? " " Strain? You mean de cookin " and waitin on folks? " " Naw, Jody, it jus " looks lak it keeps us in some way we ai n't natural wid one " nother. Yo &se; always off talkin " and fixin " things, and Ah feels lak Ah 'm jus " mirkin " time. Hope it soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ god, Ah ai n't even started good. Ah told you in de very first beginnin " dat Ah aimed tuh be uh big voice. You ought a be glad, " cause dat makes uh big woman outa you. " A feeling of coldness and fear took hold of her. She felt far away from things and lonely.
