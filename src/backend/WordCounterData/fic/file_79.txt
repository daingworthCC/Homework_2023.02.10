1011941 for Rachel Melamed-Eytan <p> An acquaintance that began midwinter <p> ripened by the end of spring. <p> A kindly woman, conciliatory. <p> She had a son, <p> a fallen soldier. <p> She bakes and cooks <p> part-time for City Hall. <p> A hot lunch is always ready on the table. <p> And everything she does is an absolute refusal <p> to adjust. <p> In her own way, as if unperturbed, <p> she can stop the world short. <p> It 's hard to know what she might do. <p> Without saying anything much, really, <p> she stakes her claim. <p> Did n't they take away her son? <p> No way will she ever see any justice <p> in that taking. <p> And who would dare tell her : <p> Come, wash your face, it 's time, <p> be strong, <p> whatever happened, happened. <p> She sets out on an arduous journey, <p> a circular journey, to and fro. <p> With her own hands she heaps coals of fire beneath her, <p> deliberately strews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Which Rachel? <p> The one who had a son. <p> And she tells him night and day, <p> summer and winter, feast day and holiday : <p> I am Rachel, your mother <p> of clear mind and free will, <p> I will not be comforted. <p> -Dahlia Ravikovitch, translated by Chana Bloch and Chana Kronfeld <p>
