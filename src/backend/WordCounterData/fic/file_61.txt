1009241 I like staying overnight at my Gramma Ruiz 's house-that is, until Gramma starts telling me how wonderful my cousin Maya is. Then it 's Maya this and Maya that until I do n't ever want to hear another word about her. <p> That 's why I was n't too excited when Gramma called me on the phone to " come on over and bring your pj 's. " When I got there, it was worse than I 'd expected. There, in Grandpa 's big leather rocker, sat Maya, all dressed up and formal-looking and wearing fancy shoes as if she 'd just been to a party. <p> " Surprise, Kristen! " Gramma Ruiz said. " Your cousin Maya and her parents have traveled in from the East Coast on business. Maya gets to visit with us this afternoon while your Aunt Marcy and Uncle Victor go to a meeting downtown. " <p> Maya was squinting at me while Gramma chattered away about how excited she 'd been for this surprise get-together, and how cousins ought to get to know each other better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till five o'clock to pick her up. <p> I hung my baseball cap in the closet and set my backpack by the stairway, all the time smiling and nodding as if I 'd been waiting forever for this chance to spend an afternoon with Maya. <p> Grandpa 's chair squawked as Maya rocked back and forth. It 's the chair I like best in the house, the one I usually sit in. I sat down on the sofa across from her. <p> Shortly, Gramma went off to the kitchen to " see about some lunch, " she 'd said. That left me stuck in the living room with rocking Maya. <p> She was still petite, but taller than I 'd remembered her from her last visit four years ago, and she looked sort of pinched in the face. She was good at small talk, though, and was chirping away about how nice it was to see me again. But I could tell that she did n't really think so. She looked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a skunk crossing her path. <p> We sat there awhile chit -- chatting. I could n't remember what it was I did n't like about her. The last time she was here, we 'd had hours of fun together building caves out of Gramma 's sofa pillows. <p> After that, I 'd heard about her only through Gramma 's tales. Maya taking piano lessons. Maya learning baton. Maya, Maya, Maya. Now Maya was here, looking great with the latest haircut and a sophisticated dress. <p> I glanced down at my jeans and my grubby sneakers. I wished I had n't come. It was bad enough that she was Gramma 's favorite -- smarter, tinier, and more talented than I was-but sophisticated, too? This was too much. <p> Maya 's words crashed through my thoughts. " I hear you like to skate, " she was saying. I was surprised. I wondered how she knew about my skating. <p> " I hear you take piano lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face, and she nodded. <p> " I hear you were captain of your softball team, " she said. <p> IMG
