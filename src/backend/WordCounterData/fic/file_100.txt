1015341 " Since you 're coming East to scout locations for another chainsaw bedtime story, " Mother 's letter began, " please visit your father. His birthday greeting arrived last week. A snapshot. He 's grown a ponytail and a beard. Is he telling me I should be glad he abandoned me after twenty years of marriage? I 'll never forget that day. " I skipped to the postscript. " Please do n't send any more videos of those films you 've allowed yourself to become involved with. They terrify Colette. " <p> Colette is Mother 's ancient Angora. Father named her. <p> I was assigned to scout around Salem. Father lived out of my way by God-knows-where. Maybe I should 've followed my feelings, such as they were n't, but at the last minute I changed my ticket from Boston to New York. Feeling as though I floated through a dream only partially interrupted by the light of day, I almost took the Cross-Bronx Expressway to connect with the Connecticut Turnpike. As the first flakes turned to water on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thru-Way toward my father and his past. <p> In my imagination it 's always snowing in up-state New York. Blame that on my father too. <p> " Drifts! This high, Ruthy! " And he 'd plop his hand over his heart. " Up there winter goes on forever! " <p> " It ' s never summer? " <p> " Only in here. " And his stabbing finger would gently poke my chest. <p> By the time I passed the Herkimer exit, snowplows were doing their thing. Escaping salt and sand pinging the windshield, I finally eased into Utica. If I got the visit over fast, I could make Hartford by midnight. I did n't waste time phoning him. <p> In his few allusions to his parents ' house the place loomed as very imposing. The courtesy of furtive moonlight failed to veil its decay. Only the drifting vista of the grounds remained true to his description. Perhaps he had n't lied about his father 's impromptu croquet tournaments, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sunlight. Maybe summer had really bloomed -- if not in Utica, at least upon the sprawling confusion of the New England Colonial-Italianated villa, a grotesque contrariety suggestive of my paternal grandparents ' backgrounds, which I 'd received hints about by hearing Father 's alcoholic outbursts. <p> " Mother 's side : Plymouth Rock! Jonny Edwards! Flappers in the embrace of an angry dance marathon judge! Father 's : Rome! Florence! Greatgrandfather made fun of Hawthorne for insisting on fig leaves on statues! " <p> Had I dreamed Father 's outbursts? I wondered so out loud one Sunday during dinner. I know it was a Sunday because I was wearing a cast on my right arm. Saturday had been my ninth birthday, Father had forgotten to buy a present, so he took me over to Rockefeller Center. I 'd never been on skates. He was teaching me a kind of dance. As we twirled to the finale, he slipped backward. I went flying. He twisted his ankle. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statues, Daddy? " <p> Mother put her finger to her lips. That meant I had to wait till the maid withdrew. <p> Mother said, " You must never speak of family matters in front of Agnes, dear. Not even your nightmares. " " Follow that advice, " Father thundered, " and you 'll have to turn into a mute! " <p> Mother 's lips hardly moved, " Winston, dear, what is that supposed to mean? " <p> " It means, my dear, that we 're all each other 's servants. " <p> " I fail to follow. " <p> " Agnes is our servant. We also serve her. " <p> Mother smiled like my pet goldfish. " What an uncharacteristic thing for you to say! " <p> " Blame it on the Buddhist monk who set himself on fire. " <p> He often said things like that. I seldom knew what he referred to. Without warning his words still flash in my mind. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. It 's too late to tell Father I understand. <p> I urged the car through the drifts of the circular drive, slogged past the protruding cypresses, could n't find the bell, and clanged the icy knocker. <p> His hair, pulled back to the yellow-ribboned ponytail, was white. <p> " Do n't you recognize me, Daddy? " <p> Whether he intended to keep the tumbler of gin eye-level the better not to see me or to lower it to study my face, I was n't sure. <p> " Ah, the prodigal! But is it you or I? " Draining the glass, he drew me into the marble foyer. " Do n't answer that! I 'm not into ontology! " He gestured toward the cluttered shadows. " Take a seat, Ruthy! Take anything! This is your paternal inheritance. " <p> Had I driven miles out of my way to be the object of his stupid games? " I ca n't stay long, Daddy. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Time enough for me to take a look at you? Turn on a light. There 's a Tiffany over there somewhere. " <p> I navigated around tilting piles of books, interrupted by a wobbly dance with a life-size statue. <p> " Let her fall and shatter! She 's a chipped replica of Great-grandfather 's Parisian paramour who broke the old goat 's heart. " <p> " There 's no bulb. " <p> " So let there be dark. Like a drink? Mine 's gin, but I 've got everything here. " <p> " Perhaps a Perrier? " <p> " Don ' t drink? " <p> " AA. " <p> Something loose was scraping against the window. <p> " Still smoke? " <p> " Not for five years. " <p> " Meat? " <p> " Since you ask, I 've given up meat. " <p> " But you do jog? I mean, they all jog nowadays. " <p> " I do my three miles a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God! One thousand ninety-two a year! You must be exhausted. Stop trying to ignite that lamp and stretch out on this horsehair divan. Horsehair, came into fashion when the ditto shirts went out. " <p> " May I say something? " <p> " I would n't stop you for the world. " <p> " This place is falling apart. There 's a drainpipe banging against the window out there. This room 's a mess. Do we have to be in the dark? Your stupid lamp does n't have a bulb! " <p> " Several drainpipes are loose. The ballroom upstairs leaks. But the house is structurally sound. This parlor is n't a mess. The furniture 's draped with clean sheets. White. Vintage 1932. Oneida sheets. Before the mills skipped South. We ' re not in the dark. Those chandeliers in the foyer and the hall east their glow. I 'll locate a bulb for the lamp. It 's a Tiffany and very beautiful. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " This part of Utica was never referred to as a neighborhood. But you do have a dull point. Still, things could be worse. I could be dodging snowballs in Bucharest. " <p> I blanked. What was that supposed to mean? <p> " What 're you doing with your life, Daddy? " <p> " Oh, that? " <p> " Where 's your head at! " <p> " I was referring to the corpses. I 've written a poem from the viewpoint of Ceausescu 's dog. Did you know Nicolae was fond of pit-bulls? Care to read it? Perhaps it could serve as a treatment for one of your horror films. Speaking of which, considering our Century 's festivities, do n't you think your films are redundant? " <p> The Tiffany bloomed. Like a sunset in a mirror. <p> " Good-bye, Daddy. " <p> " Before you leave, help me fix the drainpipe? " <p> " I never saw you hold a hammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! I 'll get the ladder from the ballroom. I was trying to fix the leak up there. Meet me out front! " <p> My job was to steady the ladder. Something had happened to the night. The wind had changed its mind and screamed from the south. I had to use both hands and dig in my heels. All went well till the slate roof released a rush of snow. I jumped away in time. The hand grasping the hammer protruded from the avalanche. <p> In the kitchen, larger than my condo, I made him tea. <p> " I 'd like to read your poem. " <p> " When the quarterly comes out, I 'll mail it. What 's your address? " <p> I fumbled in my shoulder-bag for my card. <p> He held it to the light. " Santa Monica. Have a view of the sea? " <p> " Yes, but I have a pool. " <p> " Ever snow in Hollywood? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me what you think of my poem? " <p> " I promise. " I threw on my coat. <p> " You ca n't stay the night? " <p> " No. " <p> " I 'll walk you to your car. " <p> " Put on a coat, Daddy. " <p> " God, how very California you look! Are your soles tan also? " <p> " It 's cold out there! " <p> " We up-staters are used to the cold. " <p> The cypresses were dripping. Something serious was happening to the air. The snow was sticky, not grainy. I should know. As I opened the car door, the snowball grazed the back of my head. <p> " So you want to play, Dad! " <p> He 'd always been too fast. Mine exploded against the front door just as it clicked shut. <p> I made Hartford by midnight and checked into the first motel I saw. Blame it on my wobbly statue-dance, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, whatever. Around two I gave up trying to sleep, yanked on my jogging suit and did six miles through the northern night. <p> Two weeks later the magazine with his poem arrived. I 'd never heard of the magazine. I did n't understand the poem. Neither did my agent. <p> He did the rolled-up-eyes bit. " This is a treatment for a film? " <p> " It 's a very deep poem. " <p> " You want deep, you 're in the wrong business. " <p> I kept my promise. All I came up with was : ' What I really like about your poem is the ending. ' Too late, I thought, What if he takes that the wrong way! <p> He did n't have the opportunity. <p> Mother phoned that evening. " Your father passed away this afternoon. His heart apparently. How did he seem when you saw him? " <p> What could I say? <p> " Did he seem happy? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think he missed you. Morn, you still there? " <p> " I 'm still here. " <p> " Mom, when did Daddy start writing? " <p> " He was always scribbling. Between cases. He hated the law. " <p> " Why did n't someone ever tell me? " <p> " Why should I have told you! He never told me! It was never mentioned. Maybe he thought it would be a bad influence. " <p> " What 's that supposed to mean! " <p> But I knew. I know too many writers. <p> Later, floating in the pool with this fantastic view of the sea, I wished to God I could tell him he 'd had no need to worry. I could 've handled it. <p> In a couple of days I 'm flying East for the funeral. Mother is n't. My agent wants me to take my camcorder. <p> " You out of it? What 'll I say, I 'm into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're in the movie business. Scouting locations. They 'll think they 'll be in a movie. They 'll love it! Take it! Shoot! A free-lance can always use raw footage. " <p> No one else came. A false spring day. Sunlight on the city below. Gurgle of rushing water. <p> Daddy 's lawyer drove up as I was leaving. We introduced ourselves. <p> Something about him reminded me of Daddy -- fore the beard, the ponytail, long ago, even before out abortive dance at Rockefeller Center -- till I studied the expression of his eyes. Blissfully unpreoccupied. <p> " Your mother said you 'd be coming. I 'm glad I caught you. I went to the house. I thought you 'd be there by now. " He held out a plain brown envelope. " The estate will be in probate for a year. But I thought you could use this. " <p> " What is it? " <p> " The key. In case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not. " <p> " Keep it in case. " <p> I shouldn 've known better. Blame it on what I do for a living. <p> All the furniture was neatly sheeted, even great-grandfather 's paramour. I screeched open the drapes in each of the twenty-two rooms. The light was perfect. The wind-up vic in the ballroom worked. To the scratchy echo of the waltz I wasted a lot of film. <p> In the white enameled kitchen I threw cold water on my face. Not finding a towel, I flipped up a comer of the statue 's sheet, reset the lock and hurried to my car. <p> Somewhere over the middle of our country between the light and the dark I burst into tardy tears. <p> <p> By George Blake <p>
