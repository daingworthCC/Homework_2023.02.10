5002741 # Kyle Waller was retired from his job at InvoTech for exactly twenty business days when he found himself crouched at the helm of an old fishing boat, sputtering across the jade skin of the Mopan River in Belize. The boy Oscar was at the stern, manning the rudder while the woman from Florida and her teenaged son sat athwart, withering in the heat, heads shrouded in sunglasses and safari hats, noses white with zinc. The farther they traveled up the river, the more the jungle canopy thickened with poisonwood and breadnut, blossoming bribri, florets of tamarind spreading like parasols over the river 's breach. Along the bank, iguanas sunned themselves on the mudstone flats. # " Oscar, " Kyle called, turning to show the boy his profile. " How long before we hit Bullet Tree Falls? " # " I think so fifty minutes, " Oscar shouted over the throaty rattle of the motor. " About fifty, but maybe more, actually. " # Kyle glanced back to get a good look at Oscar 's arm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lineage. As expected : no wristwatch. Kyle felt a wave of agitation tickle the nape of his neck, but the boy gave him a double thumbs-up and smiled so broadly and so earnestly that Kyle suppressed the impulse to bark out an order. Old habits died hard. # " Well, " he said, checking his own watch. Theyd left the lodge at Benque Viejo at nine in the morning. It was already ten twenty, and the day felt as if it were running away from them. Still, he held up an appreciative hand and dipped his chin in deference to the young captain. " Looks like we 're making good time. Good job, Oscar. " # The late-morning heat arranged itself around them, invisible, viscous, aboriginal -- a solid thing you could touch. Kyle gave his arthritic fingers a callisthenic stretch before hiding his aching fists in the pockets of his shorts. He grumbled into his shirt collar and looked back up, squinting at the murky green river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacation, " the woman from Florida said. " Why the rush? " # Her name was Cheryl, and her son was called Diggs, after a great-great-grandmother of Norman descent, a nine-teenth-century?? migr?? of alleged prominence. Kyle had gotten an earful last night at the lodge, over happy-hour cashews and plantains washed down with 100proof Jaguar Juice. Cheryl 's sun sign was cancer ; she was ten-years divorced and ran a specialty cake shop out of a crawfish joint in Kissimsmee ; Grandmother Diggs was on her side of the family, and so on. Kyle recalled business-school classmates with inherited Christian names -- Baines, Palmer, Reese -- a ritual of the wealthy. He imagined her kid at Harvard. It was an absolute absurdity. Diggs had black-dyed hair that hung in knotted strands below the limp brim of his hat, and his sunglasses -- large Audrey-Hepburn shades trimmed in tortoiseshell and worn ironically -- obscured his eyes and his angst-ridden secrets. Kyle felt a passing shot of relief at never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rush? " Cheryl asked again. # The outboard motor stammered and spat, slowing the boat. Oscar muttered something in Spanish -- not a curse -- and hit the powerhead with the bony base of his palm. It resumed its low rumble, and the boat lurched back on its course, sending Cheryl stumbling in her seat, making a frenzied grab for the gunwale. The ride stabilized and she caught herself, shimmying up straight and pushing at the bridge of her sunglasses, pretending to adjust the tip of her hat. Diggs looked portside where two Caribbean women, one old and one young, were pulling ropes of laundry out of the water at the rivers edge, while a toddler in soiled Fruit of the Looms waded in the shallows, waving. # Kyle lifted his palm to the child as they passed. # " I need to get to the bones before dark, " he said. # Kyle had met the osteologist on one of his cool-down drives twenty business days ago after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all their arguments, it had hardly been a fight at all, only the beginning of one -- Kyle, having no interest in bringing his work personality home, had removed himself from the situation with great efficiency. They 'd just returned from his retirement party, and she was talking nonstop as she tended to do after a drink or two. And while she was in the bedroom doing whatever it was she did in her post-party haze-unbuckling sandals, emptying her purse, unrolling stockings -- he retreated to his office to make a quick phone call to Bernie. It was midnight and outside the window of propriety, but he 'd overheard a troubling conversation in the men 's room at the Ritz, and now it was an infuriating itch he had to scratch. # Bernie answered the phone brightly, but when he heard his old boss say the words " lost inventory " something in the tenor of his voice tightened. # " It 's under control, " Bernie assured him. # " The exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said, lowering himself into his smoking chair. He used his toes to kick off his patent-cap Balmorals, and he stretched his black-socked feet out onto the plush of the antique Khorassan carpet, a staple from the old days. " Not four million. Apparently nothings changed -- the VP of Operations is the last to know about the goddamned operation. I have to spy on you bastards in the head to get the inside scoop on anything. " # " People talk shit in the pisser, " Bernie said. ' " Talk shit in the pisser. ' See what I did there? " # " Bern. This is big. " # Patty appeared in the doorway in a nightshirt and soft pants, her hair in a scarf. She was holding up a bottle of Glenfarclas by the neck, brazenly, like a cowboy of the Old West. # Kyle waved her away. # " No offense, Kyle, " Bernie said over the phone. " But. Remember what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk? You got a watch. A good one. " # " Work does n't end when you stop working, " Kyle said, stupidly. # Patty stood there, giving him a close-lipped stare, her scotch-holding arm dropping like a weight. Bernie, too, was silent on the other end of the line. # " We 're talking my legacy, " Kyle said. " Is what I 'm saying. " # " I 'm zonked, " Bernie said. " Do you mind horribly if we talk tomorrow? Even later if you like. It 's... well. You 're on permanent vacation. You can retire the ' Czar ' shtick for a change, go have fun. " # " Control that inventory, will you? For me. " # " All right, boss. All right. Great party. We should hit the links sometime. " # " Sounds fine, " said Kyle. # He hung up the phone and braced himself for Patty. She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an amateur play. " Boy oh boy howdy, " she said. " This is fresh. The freshest of the fresh fresh fresh. " # Kyle put his smartphone on the armrest of his chair and covered it with his palm. " We lost a boatload of inventory, " he said. " I mean a cataclysmic amount of raw goods. " # " How do you ' lose ' inventory exactly? " she said, working around his outstretched legs to slump into an old loveseat nearby, pulling her feet up under her rump like a child. " Sounds suspicious. What kind of things are these things, anyhow? " # " PCBs. Fuses. Toilet plungers. Do n't worry about it. " # " Ca n't they just... I do n't know. Look for them? " # While Kyle calmed himself by counting silently in his head, he watched Patty 's eyes wander around the small room -- to the handmade shelves stacked two-books deep, the bureau-plat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the words Patience, Attention, Praise framed and leaning on a strip of case molding, finally landing on the set of blurry wall photos from their last trip together as a couple -- Milan, more than a decade ago. He 'd canceled a show at La Scala to visit a struggling vendor on the outskirts of the city and gotten into trouble back then too -- and for what? For doing his job? Providing for her? He saw his wife now, looking shabby and worn and eerily like his mother, sitting there aslant in the folds of the couch, liquor bottle in her lap, her gaze aimless and her face shimmering with a thick layer of cold cream. He counted to nine, then ten. # " First of all, " he said, his count complete, " it 's not quite that easy to ' find ' things on a Fortune-500 manufacturing floor. Second of all, it 's a lose-lose. If we find the inventory, it 's four million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's shrinkage. A colossal unanticipated expense with a meager tax offset. At best. " # " Sorry I asked, " Patty said. # " Well, I suppose it 's not a question of'we ' anymore, " he said, digging his knuckles into the hollows of his eye sockets and rubbing them in slow circles. He opened his eyes wide, as if in astonishment, but the room was a fog -- of hazel light, spines of books, the shape of his wife -- so he shut them again. " It 's ' they ' now. We, they... any which way it 's goddamned sloppy. It 's their godforsaken duty to mind the shop. Shameful, is what it is. # " Stupid, stupid Patty, " his wife said. " Stupid Patty to think that when Kyle retired, Kyle would actually stop working. " # " Kyle 's not working, " Kyle said, eyes still closed. " So let 's all relax. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patty said. " Thank God for our knight in shining vicu?? a wool blend. A regular superhero. When the hell is someone going to rescue me from my tree? I 'm meowing, Kyle, I 'm meowing. " # Everywhere he went, it seemed : grownups acting like children. Shirking responsibilities and checking their common sense at the door, diving head first into kerfuffles of every kind. He did n't need his wife piling on too, with her juvenile compulsions and childish carping. He waited in the quiet of the room, and when it seemed his wife was n't going to speak again, he blinked his eyes open, stood, reached his fists up to the ceiling to stretch the long sinews of his knotted back, and he left. # Kyle changed out of his tuxedo into a pair of pressed jeans and a golf shirt and got in his car and drove on autopilot toward his regular late-night haunt -- Plus? a Change, a Westside bistro owned by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shuttered for the evening, he made an impulsive judgment call to try the late-night taquer? a next door. All he wanted was some down time, a place to collect his thoughts, a quiet corner where he could sit for a moment and figure out his next move now that the last forty years of his life had come to an abrupt close. In the words of his old life coach, it was time to design a new playbook for the upcoming season. # Inside the taquer? a it was long and narrow and dimly lit by Moroccan lamps hanging from the domed Quonset-hut ceiling. A row of two-tops cut from unfinished pine ran along one side, an ebony-and-pleather bartop along the other. The walls were lined with unintentionally comical portraits of famous Mexican luchadores, painted in a primitive and color-ful Mesoamerican style. The big, lazy fronds of Asian ceiling fans turned and turned in the gloom. # There were only four other people in the establishment. A bartender, female, in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a receipt behind the bar. In the corner of the room, at a table farthest from the entrance, a couple sat side-by-side, so motionless in the dusky light as to appear either asleep or in deep consideration of their love. The fourth was the osteologist, Brenda. # She was sipping liquor from a set of sampler glasses lined up on a stone tray. Kyle took a seat at the bar, leaving an empty stool between them. # " Kitchen 's closing if you want food, " she said, tilting her head toward the bartender. # " I do, " said Kyle. He did n't, but he felt beholden to the rhythm of the conversation. He waved the bartender over and asked, " What 's good? " # " Kitchen 's closing, " the bartender said as she approached, slinging a terrycloth towel over her shoulder. " Guac 's made here. Carne asada tacos. " # " Gim me two, " he said. " Please. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him and rapped her knuckles on the wood top with an air of finality before jogging off to the far end of the restaurant where she disappeared behind a swinging metal door. # " You come to a place like this, " Brenda said, looking sideways at the bartop in front of Kyle, " and order soda? The food here sucks, just so you know. Tequila? " # She raised one of her sampler glasses in an offering, keeping her gaze low. # " I do n't drink, " he said. # She lifted the glass to her lips and smiled into it before tipping it back and swallowing the shot whole. " Agh, " she said, bringing her chin to her shoulder. " Smooth. " # The contours of her face were determined and cross and her hair was cropped close to her skull in a pixie style. At thirtyish, she was too old for the cut, it made Kyle think of cancer. # " You celebrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said with a lippy grimace. " It 's Saturday night. It 's what we do on Saturdays. And Sundays, and Mondays. Most Tuesdays. What are you... a recovering alcoholic or something? " # " Nope, " he said. " Though I will say back in the day it did take the edge off? ' # " And now? " # Kyle flicked the tips of his fingers with the nail of his thumb, looking up at the menagerie of painted luchadores, their black eyes gleaming from behind the cut-holes of their masks. They were supposed to look menacing, but they only looked anxious, as if they were bewildered by their own circumstances. # " These days, I like the edge, " he said. " I need the edge. " # She dropped her head at an angle toward him, her face shaded in the red lamplight. " Well that 's spooky, " she said. # They introduced themselves -- first names only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, there was a new, subtle intimacy between them. If someone were to have walked in at that moment, it would have seemed there were now two couples in the taquer? a, one skulking in the dark and another sharing a moment of quiet conviviality at the bar. # She shifted over to the stool next to him. " Know who you remind me of? " Brenda said, reaching over to slide the tray of tequila samplers across the bar top. " Indiana Jones. " # " Earlier I was wearing a tux. You would 've thought more James Bond. " # " Whoa, " she said, with a rasp of a whistle. " Player. " # " Just grownups playing dress-up, " he said. " It was a party. They threw me a retirement party. " # " Oh yeah? Must 've been fancy shmancy. A regular corporate hoe down. What the hell are you doing here, anyway? After midnight. I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Geez, now that I 'm retired, I 'm wondering, " he said. " What 's next on the agenda? " # Brenda 's face opened up in a sardonic giggle. " The next item up is as follows : Meeting Adjourned. Forever. " # " Laugh it up, " he said. " Old peoples problems are somebody else 's cute sitcom until you wake up one day and the shoe 's on the other foot. Literally, because you 're so senile you do n't know which foot is which. That was an actual episode of The Golden Girls. Which you have no idea what I 'm talking about, I 'm sure. " # " What were you, some kind of banker or something? " # " Vice President of Operations, " he said, with an odd feeling of pride, now that it was all over. " They called me The Efficiency Czar ". # Brenda attempted a spit take, but she was too clumsy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What, it 's not so strange, " he said. " Efficiency is a way of life. In any job -- any situation, really -- there are an infinite number of possibilities. Do you want the beer or the tequila or the wine or the bourbon? You could have them all, I suppose, but it would cost money and make you sick to your stomach. So you have to choose one and be OK with walking away from the others. It 's a question of seeing what 's possible and committing to what 's practical. It 's the key to being successful in anything you do. Efficiency was my life 's work. That 's awfully maudlin. I realize. " # He watched Brenda sadly as she put her hand around her last little glass, tipping it toward her and frowning into the drink as if she 'd discovered something floating on its surface. # " It 's true, " she said to herself. " Retired people do die when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said. " Nobody 's dying over here. I 've got a full bank account and no kids pulling at the old purse strings. This is when life begins. I 'm ready. Raring, even. " # Brenda jerked back, suddenly alive, making a full, sloppy turn on her stool as if her entire body were a half-step behind. " You are Indiana Jones. But not like, from way back, when he was all studly with his whip and cargo pants and stuff. " # " Gee. Thanks. " # " No, I mean the way he 'd be now. " She patted at the air in front of his face as if to fan her ideas his way. " Older, but still adventuring. Is that a word? Looking for your next project, say. " # The bartender appeared with two tacos wrapped in foil and a highball glass filled with clear soda. " That 'll be eleven dollars, " she said. " Speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for real. " # Kyle reached into his pant pocket and put a twenty on the bar. " Keep it, " he said. Then to Brenda, " Guess I could do worse. Harrison Ford 's a solid actor. " # " No, no, " she said. " No. No. " Her foot missed a rung as she shifted her weight on the stool, sending her body slumping briefly forward. Undaunted, she put a light hand on his arm to steady herself. " Not Harrison Ford. Indiana Jones. And boy, Indie, do I have a story for you. Listen. Have you ever been to Belize? Do you know anything about bones? " # The dock at Bullet Tree Falls was painted turquoise and peeling in ragged strips in the relentless moisture and subtropical heat. Kyle made an off-handed comment about it to Oscar and the boy replied that a dock was a place of welcoming -- like a floor mat in a home, it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. # " But the foot traffic, " Kyle said, stomping for emphasis on the weathered wood with the sole of his trail boot. " The traipsing alone is bad for the paint. But then you 've got all the rainfall too. It does n't make any sense, no? Gim me a day with this thing and I 'll have it stripped and sealed and ready for a thousand tourists. " # But Kyle remembered he was n't here as a tourist, or even as the Efficiency Czar. He was the Older Indie, here in the jungle on a mission. # Diggs climbed out of the boat and brushed past Kyle, knocking him in the shoulder, his mother trailing behind. Oscar, playing the willing role of the good-natured local, shook his head at his guests ' antics while he secured the boat to one of the dock 's two rusted cleats. His hands moved expertly around the bright nylon rope, as if each finger were proficient in its own unique task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew, about an array of things, and how much more there was to learn despite his age and maturity. It was an awareness that made him feel both helpless and hopeful, and more than anything it made him want to ditch his extra cargo and get on the road toward El Pilar -- and Brenda 's legendary bones. # Two weeks ago, he 'd called Oscar and offered him what seemed a meager sum -- seven thousand dollars -- to loan him a car and get him a map to the bones near the Guatemalan border. Patty 's consent to his solo trip was manifest in her silence ; to her credit she was n't in the habit of requiring approvals for his various pursuits -- out loud, anyway. Oscar accepted his proposition and the cash exchanged hands last night during happy hour, on the back porch and away from prying eyes. The owner of the Mopan River Lodge, a pale, brittle woman around Kyle 's age who haunted the rooms of her resort in bohemian dresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- about the deal between Kyle and Oscar, and about there being any bones at all. Kyle guessed she was a rich American WASP who paid Oscar fairly and on time and had no interest in his life away from his day-tour duties at the lodge -- and neither did Oscar have any inclination to delve into her first-world problems. The boy had a utilitarian view of his job, as he did of the North Americans who came to visit each month, but he was also considerate, loyal, and intrepid, just the kind of young man Kyle would 've hired back in his days as a budding line manager. He had the brief, distasteful notion that Oscar put them all-the lodge owner, Kyle, Cheryl, Diggs -- in the same category of privileged ignorance, and the thought sent a full-bodied shudder through his spine. # Cheryl and Diggs were huddled under the pink blossoms of an ancient dogwood, sheltering themselves from a light rain that was beginning to tap and patter around them -- against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Kyle could n't wait to be rid of them so he could continue on his quest. A footpath of tamped-down grass and mud trailed away from the embankment and disappeared into a copse of fruit-bearing trees. Kyle walked toward it with his backpack slung over his shoulder. He looked back at Oscar who 'd finished hitching the boat and was giving the hull an affectionate thump of his hand. # " I 've got the map, " Kyle said. " Where 's the truck? " # " My car is in town, " Oscar said, waving the others toward the path. " It 's close. We walk down there -- and there 's Paslow Road, actually. " # The town of Bullet Tree Falls was just beyond the thicket of trees that lined the natural levee of the Mopan River. As they walked the path, raindrops making tiny divots in the mud, the forest quickly opened up and a village appeared in the clearing below, with homes scattered among clusters of towering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertile expanse. # " What map? " Cheryl said, hoisting her Bloomingdale 's shopper over her shoulder and shading her face from the rain. As far as she knew, they were spending the day in Bullet Tree Falls -- not going off the beaten path with some mysterious map. She and Diggs removed their shades and squinted like moles into the bright mist. # " The moisture 's nice, " said Kyle to Oscar. " Steady rainfall 's nice. " # Oscar nodded, absently, as if he did n't care or know exactly how to talk about the rain. Like Alaskans and the snow, Oscar almost certainly had thirty-seven words for rain, but it was something at once too mundane and too essential to serve as a topic of conversation. To these people, rain was like money, like air. Kyle held his palm out to feel the raindrops on his skin. # " He 's ditching us, " said Diggs to his mother. " He 's looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Cheryl. # As they reached Paslow Road, Oscar walked ahead of them with spritely urgency. He was carrying very little gear with him -- an American fanny pack, a multipurpose knife hanging from a steel-ball chain around his neck, a lightweight oilskin slung around his waist. " I think so Mr. Waller has someplace to go to, " he said, calling back without turning. # " I 'm running an errand, " said Kyle. " I need to bring something back for a friend. " # " Running something from Central America for a friend? " said Diggs. " Sounds dubious. " # " My house is over there, " Oscar said as they neared a patchy lot set back twenty feet from the edge of the road, a lime-green shanty sitting at its center and an antique blue F-150 parked under a thatch out back. The rain surged, then eased, as if it had been shut off by hand, leaving a glimmering sheen all over the valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treetops, and in the distance, where the rainforest pushed into the perimeter of the village, the hoarse calls of howler monkeys rose out of the mist. # " We 'll come with you, " Diggs said. # Kyle kicked himself for mentioning the bones on the boat, for being carried away by the romanticism of his expedition, for showing off. " You 're right about it being a dubious mission, " he said, speaking to Diggs but looking at his mother. " Dangerous. " # From his fanny pack, Oscar dug out a set of keys secured to a small leather switch and handed them to Kyle, nodding toward his truck. " Go up to Main, " he said, pointing to a macadam road that bisected Paslow a half-mile north of where they stood. " On Main there is a crossroad. Straight takes you to Santa Familia. Do n't go straight. Go to the left. Then nine miles you drive, and then you 'll be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Kyle. " Straight on Main, left at the T. The rest is on the map, yeah? " # Oscar nodded. " Come back by four o'clock. Please. We take the boat back to the lodge from here. It gets dark by five-thirty, actually. So please. Remember. " # Kyle heard it before he felt it -- the drizzle, as it resumed -- pattering on the hood of his jacket, the leaves, the wood siding of the pastel houses, the thatched roofs. In seconds he was peering at Oscar through a full sheet of rain. # " Four o'clock, " Oscar hollered over the rainfall. # " You 're not wearing a watch, " Kyle yelled back. # Oscar dug into this fanny pack again and showed Kyle his iPhone. # " Nobody uses a watch anymore, " Oscar said with a laugh, oblivious to his T-shirt soaking through. " Or maybe this is just in Belize? " # On their way out, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, righting herself by holding on to the doorjamb and horse-stepping over the sill, one foot before the other. She had insisted on getting some air, and Kyle had taken a long swig of his club soda, leaving his tacos at the bar. # Brenda stopped just outside the taqueria with heavy-lidded eyes, her skin cast in a sickly shade of green from the neon sign above their heads, " MEXICAN, " the sign said. Kyle reached out to hold her elbow but she swatted it away. # " I 'm good, " she said. " I just... I 'm good. " # There, standing in the eerie wash of neon, Kyle felt the pull of an involuntary sense memory : Vegas, 1982, a girl at his side, a straight flush on the table. He was there for a bachelor party, not his own, and it was the only time he 'd seriously contemplated stepping out on his marriage. Thirty some-odd years later he could n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember how tall she was, and what she smelled like -- Oriental spices with the creamy undertone of cocoa butter. The other thing he recalled was the indelible kindness of her expression, the tilted head and the squint of her eyes, which seemed to reveal not only care but curiosity, pity. He had won his poker hand and shed grazed his wrist with the tips of her fingernails, and in his imagination there was a flash-forward of room keycards and the undoing of buttons and the brine of sex and the flagrant light of morning, and after he had a chance to live it -- the next eight hours in a moment -- he 'd declined, willingly, and without regret. # Now he watched Brenda dig into her purse to produce a Marlboro Red and a plastic Bic. With her cigarette lit, she took a long drag and propped herself up against the building 's brick facade. She let her cigarette-holding arm dangle toward the sidewalk and held the inside of her elbow with her free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath, careful not to blow smoke into Kyle 's face. # " Boy, have I got a story for you, " she said. " Let 's walk. " # As they strolled down Cedar Avenue, navigating a pattern of dark and light under the glow of the city 's Victorian streetlamps, Brenda told Kyle that she, too, was celebrating the end of her career, although in her case it had n't been a matter of choice. An archaeologist specializing in bones at the local Museum of Natural History, Brenda had recently lost her job and had been booted out of something called the SAA, which Kyle understood to be some sort of social club for natural scientists. # " It 's a society, not a club, Jesus, " Brenda said, " it 's a really big deal. They set guidelines and standards for forensics and stuff, there 's educational outreach. They have an ethics committee. It 's not as if they hang out at the school gym @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, dude. " # " Ethics? " Kyle said. " As in, should we or should n't we dig up tombs and risk the wrath of local hordes and mummy curses? I know all about archaeology, I saw the Tutankhamen exhibit in San Francisco in 1979. There was a lot of gold. Why 'd you lose your job? " # " Tutankha-moon, " Brenda said. " Because I told them if I saw one more Paleolithic fly, I 'd punch myself in the face. It was always microfauna, microfauna, twenty-four seven. Here 's how it works, OK? I find this flea, sitting next to a big, strange fuzzy thing that 's got everybody scratching their collective archaeological head. So I analyze this flea for weeks and months and years, and after eons of staring at it, I finally identify its taxonomy and when I do, fifty other people deduce that the previously unidentified fuzzy thing is probably fleece from a blanket or a rug, because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alert the presses and it 's so sad, because this small little flea that I spent years analyzing is the biggest victory ever for the museum. I left my job because it was like heating a pot of water with a match and waiting around for it to boil. " # " Sounds inefficient, " Kyle said. # " It 's called synanthropy, " Brenda said with an aggressive pull and exhale of her cigarette. " Discovery by inference is a legitimate approach to paleo-environmental reconstruction... but whatever, that 's beside the point. The point is this is not my job, to study bugs. " # " For God 's sake, Jim, " said Kyle, " I 'm an archaeologist, not an entomologist. " # " Exactly. Who 's Jim? " # They came upon an urban park -- a patch of grass less than a thousand-foot square with an enormous stone statue of a crouching angel in the center, encircled by four iron benches. Brenda dropped her cigarette on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and grabbed Kyle by the elbow, leading him in. He liked the way it. felt, to be guided somewhere, somewhere dim and mystifying and full of promise. He recalled Patty on a day in 1976, at their old ranch house on Polaris Avenue in Foster City, when the first snow had begun to tap against the bay window of their living room. The light patter soon intensified, growing into a flurry, and then a full-fledged snowstorm, and in the middle of this absurdity -- a snowstorm in San Francisco -- Patty questioned nothing. She only grabbed Kyle by the wrist like a child and led him into the yard, where they joined hands and spun and spun, their sneakers soaking through, their exuberant faces obscured by the white noise of the blizzard. A day in history. They were in their mid-twenties then, newlyweds. # Now Kyle observed Brenda, who, while not at all like his young wife of yesteryear, called up something of his distant past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of the park, sulking like a child in the fuzz of her intoxication, overswinging her arms in a failed effort to convey purposeful sobriety. # " You deserved to lose your job, you know, " he said, only half teasing. " I hate to say it. Your boss gives you a task, you do it. It 's an affliction of your generation. I 'm not pulling punches here. The museum, your little club -- they have a point. " # " Atta boy, Mister Man, kick me when I 'm down, " Brenda said, choosing a bench and scooting down to the edge to lean back and observe the sky. A single star blinked above them, maybe Venus, barely visible through the midnight haze. Kyle joined her, leaving a small, respectful distance between them, his knee grazing her purse. From where they sat -- behind the great statue -- the angel 's hunched back looked vaguely sinister, as if it were lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind its enormous form. # " Lookit, know-it-all, I got kicked out of **25;0;TOOLONG for an entirely different reason, " Brenda said. " This is where the plot thickens, and if you 're a good boy, I might reveal Act Two. " # " I like second acts, " Kyle said. " It 's where all the meat is. " # " They told me I was getting obsessive and unrealistic -- that I was losing my grip on reality and my profession as an archaeologist. The truth of the matter is that it 's about job security -- these yo-yos make a living off their incremental, infinitesimal work. Well, I 'm all about the Direct Hit. I 'm about Going Big. Like they say, go big or... or... " She brought the back of her hand to the tip of her nose and rubbed furiously at an itch before slumping her arm back down and resuming her position, staring at the smog overhead. " Forget it. Forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " Kyle said, touching her shoulder for a moment. He had the passing notion that he had n't spoken with anyone at any length about anything besides his own work in a very long time. He watched Brenda breathe under the light of the smoggy sky, her chest moving slowly, regularly, as if she were asleep. " Tell me. Seriously. " # She sat up as if possessed, her enthusiasm restored. " OK. " She brought her arms up by the elbows and shaped her hands around an invisible ball. " I 've got a line on some bones that are going to make history. " # " What is it? The missing link? " # " Better, " she said. " The original link. " # Brenda twisted around to paw at her purse, but she kept her eyes on him. She found her pack of Marlboros and shook one out, dropping her gaze to light the cigarette in a single, shaky gesture. She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words and smoke tumbling from her lips. # " A family of Guatemalan farmers discovered it in a cave on the border of Belize, " she said. " The near-complete remains of a humanoid three times the size of Homo sapiens. " She waited for the words to catch. " They found the skeleton of a giant. " # She tossed away her barely smoked cigarette and reached for Kyle 's hands. The sour bite of tequila was still on her breath and her eyes were glazed and dilated, irises quivering as her drunkenness reached its manic peak. But there was something in her grip, tenacious and steady, that made him pay attention. # " I may be hammered right now, but you have to listen to me. This is not a fairy tale like the SAA thinks. Go home and read your Bible. It 's in the Book of Genesis. " She lifted his hands in both of hers as if making a sacred offering to the gods. " This skeleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all humanity. " # They left Cheryl behind at Bullet Tree Falls where there was a wide variety of afternoon activities to enjoy, where she could shop, brunch, and, if she were feeling especially adventurous, go inner tubing at the Parrot Nest Outpost, where she could glide uncontrolled through the rapids of the Mopan until a cable that stretched across the breadth of the waterway caught her like an F-14 coming in for a landing, five miles down the river. # " A regular day at the spa, " shed said, coolly, to Diggs. " I did n't come all this way to this godforsaken place to spend the day alone like a drunk frat boy. This day was for us. No way are you going on a wild goose chase in the Latin jungle with this guy. Who is he? Do we know? ' Kyle Waller. ' A fake name if I 've ever heard one. " # It was a standoff. # Diggs had refused to budge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house, insisting that he come with Kyle. And Oscar -- sensing the liability of leaving Diggs, a minor, in the hands of another guest -- suggested that the three men make the trip up to El Pilar while Cheryl remained in the village with Oscar 's family. At the beginning of the deliberations, Kyle had said, simply, no, as had been his way in the office, and when that did n't take, he added, " It 's dangerous, I 'm making the trip myself? ' and when that, too, met with further obstinacy from Diggs, Kyle was stunned and dismayed to find long-forgotten emotions -- passion, rage, exasperation -- enter the tenor of his ordinarily calibrated voice. # " I paid, " he said, ragged. " When everybody ponies up their own goddamned money, they can have a say. " # He walked to the truck and climbed in, started the engine. But when he felt the thump-and-scrape of Diggs scrambling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give in or risk losing daylight. Within minutes, they were on their way to El Pilar, the three men abreast in the truck 's cab, their gear secured under a tarp in the back. As he pulled off the dirt road, Kyle felt a modicum of pity for Cheryl. He watched her dejected silhouette shrink away in the rearview mirror until Oscars mother appeared in the yard, carrying a package, or maybe it was a baby, leading Cheryl away from the road and into the house. # Kyle had insisted on driving, at least, and Oscar conceded, but now, barely five miles out of Bullet Tree Falls, he was beginning to regret it. The road was deeply pitted from year-round rainfall, which in and of itself would have been of little consequence if it had n't also been for the bank of gray thunderheads moving toward them like a distant, roiling ocean, and the landscape, which grew more and more inhospitable as he drove. Familiar signs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iglesias, the single-room bars, the unfinished concrete foundations, even the empty lots cleared of vegetation and set off by chicken wire -- were all becoming less frequent and were soon replaced by impenetrable tangles of meaty green vines, prehistoric ferns, strange fruit and stranger trees carpeted in lichen and moss, thick as pelt. Kyle became unnervingly aware of the fifteen-year-old sitting next to him, aware of the burden of his adolescence. Once on the road, Diggs had pressed him for the details of their destination and the nature of the quest, but Kyle did not respond and the boy knew not to ask again. # " This woulda been more epic than the Grail Quest, every bit as romantic and ten times as pragmatic, " Brenda had lamented on the walk back to their parked cars outside El Toro Taqueria, kneading her palms in a showy display of vexation. " But I ca n't afford to make the trip. The locals get you coming and going, you know, it 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tale took hold of Kyle in the well of his belly and clamped down there. He pushed her for details about the excavation site. It was restricted, but a young man named Oscar, a local who was intimately familiar with the terrain, had been willing to take her there -- for a price. Though he 'd never seen it himself, he 'd had a rough idea how to get there, and confirmed the rumors of a newly discovered cave system dubbed " The Den of the Ancient Child " on the border of Guatemala just south of the unexcavated Mayan city of El Pilar. By the time Brenda put her key in her car door, gazed up at Kyle in the lamplight and asked -- pitifully, earnestly, humbly -- for seven thousand dollars plus airfare and incidentals and a Canon 5D for taking high-quality photographs, Kyle had already resolved to make the trip himself. # As thunderheads neared and the low-hung skies opened once again in the lightest of sprinkles, Kyle remembered the camera in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of Oscar 's strong-line bungees. He steadied the vehicle along the pocked road for another hundred yards when a clearing appeared -- a primordial site of lush grass five acres wide and set off by the ever-encroaching jungle and, emerging from the canopy, great swelling hillocks, handfuls of them, lifting and surging in a gentle semicircle around the glade, coated in a tapestry of green. They were in northern Belize, where they could be only four miles out of the nearest village and be swallowed by dense, uninhabitable terrain. # " Just grabbing the bag, " he told the others, tugging on the door handle. # " Wait, " said Oscar, and something in the thin wire of his voice made Kyle stop cold. # A vein of white lightning appeared in the distant sky, reaching down from the looming cloud bank and disappearing before it could touch the tops of the cresting hills. Like a child, Kyle counted the seconds in his head as his mother had once taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out across the plain. # " One mile, " Diggs said. " Lightning 's close. " # Kyle eased the door open and took a breath of air, thick with the mineral scent of dirt and rain, his denim thigh quickly soaking through. He pushed the door open and, in three calculated steps, dropped with a splash into the muddy road, mounted the running board, and hopped into the truck bed. He straddled the dark mass of travel gear and unhooked the bungee, feeling with his fingers under the sopping tarpaulin for his backpack. Recognizing the bags familiar canvas skin and the bulk of the camera body tucked inside, he hoisted it up and out of the mound, slung it over his shoulder, and reattached the strong line. The rain was hitting him now in wet, violent sheets. With a hand on the tailgate, he heaved his body up and jumped out of the trucks slippery bed and into the wet gravel, circling quickly back to the driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, followed immediately by a tight crackle of thunder that seemed to twist and coil around itself until it exploded in a full-throated roar. As he reached the door another emphatic report cut through the endless pulsing rhythm of rain -- a single airborne peal followed by two more in rapid succession. In the cab, Diggs made a small bounce in the seat to make room and Kyle swung his legs in, slamming the door and the door lock behind him and tossing the bag over Diggs ' legs and into Oscar 's lap. # " What was that noise? " Kyle said in the relative quiet of the cabin, the rain outside continuing to drum. He wiped his face with both his hands and gripped the shift knob, grinding it into drive ; he thought he could feel the tires under the chassis, spitting gravel. # " You should drive, I think, just keep going, " Oscar said quickly, craning his neck behind, into the road, the clearing to the side, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not thunder, " said Diggs, rocking in his seat, ignoring the steady drip from Kyle 's jacket. # Kyle flipped on the windshield wipers and gave Diggs a side glance. " You OK? " # " Hell yeah, I 'm OK, " he said. " You OK? " # " What was that noise? " Kyle said again, forcefully now, flipping the wipers to their maximum setting. He shrugged forward to see through the frenzy of the wipers, which seemed to be doing little more than smudging rainwater across the glass. He stole a series of brief looks at Oscar, who was sitting upright, gripping the grab handle with his brown fist, his body tense and alert. " Where did it come from? Oscar. " # Oscar gave a small, private shake of his head. " I thought I saw something earlier. A car, up on the road. I think so it turned into the jungle. " # As Oscar spoke, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead : four men in camouflaged rain ponchos and heavy boots, rifles slung over their chests, waving their arms broadly, fiercely, gesturing for them to stop. # " Serious, " Diggs said, " this is serious. " # " OK, my man, " Kyle said to Oscar, reaching past Diggs and pushing him in the shoulder. " Time to step up. I do n't know anything about this Central American, guys-in-military-gear dynamic. We have choices. A. Turn around and hightail it the hell out of here. B. Stop. Or C. Which, is there a third choice? The answer is we do n't know. Answer, answer, Oscar. Answer quickly. " # " Slow down, " Oscar said. " Stop. " # Kyle brought the truck to a stop and the men descended, two on Kyle 's side, two on Oscar 's. They motioned for Kyle to open the door. Kyle shook his head, but he heard Oscar say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own voice but part of his exhaling breath, " Open it. " # Kyle undid the manual lock and pushed the door open and the men were on him, yanking him out of the cab, shoving at his shoulders and his back, hustling him forward. He felt the hard iron muzzle of an M-4 in his spine, guiding him away from the car and toward the edge of the rainforest. The others were being corralled behind him. They moved quickly in the downpour away from the road, splashing in the gravel and trudging into the tangle of trees and thigh-high grass. # They kneeled abreast in the mud -- Kyle, Oscar, and Diggs -- sheltered by the leafy cover of monstrous cotton trees. The scent of recent lightning, ashy and acidic, wafted in the air around them, and there was something else -- the sweet burn of gunpowder. # Kyle dug his knees into the wet earth. He kept his head down and his hands locked behind his neck as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, watching a pair of combat boots pace in the mud. A pit of anxiety grew in his stomach, cramping and knotting, settling in. He thought he could feel Diggs, feel his fear, as he crouched silently on the other side of Oscar. The rough edges of a shout formed in his throat but it got caught in the thick of his saliva -- and after swallowing it down, Kyle was only capable of managing a timid question. # " Can you let the kid back in the truck? " he asked the boots. # " No. " The owner of the boots nudged Oscar with the butt of his rifle. # " D?? nde vas? " # Oscar spoke clearly, without fear. " Vamos de camino a las cuevas. " # " Cuevas? " # " Uchben Chanpaal, " Oscar said. " Cerca de El Pilar. " # " Qui?? n est? pagando? " # Oscar shook his head. # " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Oscar lifted his chin toward Kyle. # Kyle felt the barrel of the man 's rifle under his own chin, lifting his head up, tenderly, like a lover. The man was stocky, clean-shaven, and dressed in head-to-toe camo gear, a bucket hat pressed down on his head. A splatter of moisture breached the canopy above and hit the man in the rim of the hat, and on his cheek. He wiped it away with the back of his hand. # " What 's your business there, " he said, in clean American English. " At Uchben Chanpaal? " # " I 'm just going to take some photos of the excavation site, " Kyle said. # " This cave is off limits to tourists, " he said. # " I 'm not really a tourist, " Kyle said. # " Oh yeah? " The man spat in the grass. " What are you, then? " # " I 'm here on an errand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not part of B-Var, you 're not welcome, " he said. " The cave is being excavated by the federal government. How do you know about it? " # Kyle looked at Oscar, and back at the man. # " A friend told me about it. Back at home. She 's a scientist with an interest in ancient civilizations. " # " Her name? " # " Brenda, " he said. " I 'm not sure about her last name. " # Oscar snapped to attention and peered at Kyle through the intermittent raindrops dripping through the trees. # The man nodded. " I see. Brenda, no last name. She must be a very good friend. " He grinned at the other men and they shared a laugh. It was ugly and mannish, their rings and watches clinking against the iron of their rifles. Their leader withdrew his weapon, slinging it back over his shoulder. # He reached out his hand and pulled Kyle up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " These are not the best of times to be playing games of buried treasure, " he said. " We are Belizean special forces. Tenemos problemas m? s grandes. We have bigger fish to fry. " # Kyle stood, feeling light in the head. He put his hand to his temple and rubbed, anchoring his feet in the muddy soil to keep from stumbling. " Your English is excellent, " he said. # He turned to Diggs, rising up from his knees, pink in the face, hands still looped around the back of his neck. " Y'all right over there? " # " Yeah, " Diggs said, bringing his arms down and shaking his hair out of his face. Oscar put a protective arm around his shoulder, but Diggs shrugged it off. # " It 's the national language of Belize, " the soldier said, heartily. " And I was born in Fresno, California. I 'd better have good English. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and into the road, their boots navigating the puddles in the gently waning rain. # When they reached the car, patrol commander Sergeant Esteban Campos put one hand on the small of Kyle 's back and extended the other for him to shake. Kyle took it. # " Listen, sir, " the sergeant said. " It 's not wise to come down this way, into our country. It pains me to say it. But we 're days away from making the US Blacklist. The Zetas cartel is here now, occupying our land, moving product through northern Belize and Guatemala. " He motioned to the other side of the road and into the hills as if to approximate the path of the runners. # Kyle nodded, uncertain how to respond. # " Yup, " the sergeant said, with a vigorous nod of his own. " Take one last look at Paradise. You wo n't see it again. Unless us good guys prevail. Eh? " He laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " Kyle said, although he was n't sure what for. # Back inside the truck, Oscar took the wheel. The engine turned over with a rumble and he pulled carefully off the embankment, maneuvering the truck in a large U as the tires crunched the road. From the passenger seat, Kyle watched the small group of soldiers congregate in the reflection of his side view mirror. They were moving swiftly, climbing one after the other into a rusted-out flatbed that had at least a decade on Oscar 's old Ford. # " I wo n't tell your mom if you do n't, " said Kyle to Diggs, as Oscar set a course for home. # Diggs reached into his jacket pocket for his sunglasses and put them on, casually, flicking damp hair out of his face. He leaned his head back and pretended to sleep between the two men. # " Mr. Waller, " Oscar said, but the words were barely out of his mouth when a great white bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the windshield from the sky. Oscar hit the brakes and the three men swayed forward with the force of the sudden stop. # He put the car in park, and as the engine idled he bent close to the windshield to inspect the dead bird, grimacing and rubbing at the glass with the ball of his finger. Diggs lifted his glasses with his knuckles and, seeing nothing of interest, returned them to the bridge of his nose and lay back against his headrest in exaggerated repose. # " Is it cracked? " Kyle asked. # " No, " Oscar said, opening his door and jumping out, the wet gravel crackling under his shoes as he headed for the back of the truck. # He returned with a large yellow chamois skin and a crowbar and walked around to the front of the vehicle. Kyle watched through the windshield as the young man made a strenuous lean over the broad hood, laying the skin out flat at the base of the wiper blades and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass. # As he worked, Oscar called out to Kyle through the open door. # " This person Brenda, " he said. " She is how you heard about Uchben Chanpaal? " # " Yeah, " Kyle said. " She said she spoke to you on the phone. You had your differences. Which is not surprising. " # " She is your friend actually. Yes? " # " I suppose, " Kyle said. " More like a daughter. Or someone else 's daughter. Why? " # Kyle watched Oscar roll the bird onto the cloth, its neck bent angrily at the base, its single visible eye open in a fishlike gaze and rimmed in a wrinkled membrane of electric blue. Unlike Brenda, he was n't in Belize for fame or retribution or self-righteousness, and though he had a notion that he 'd share his discovery with her once he was back in the states, he had n't given her much thought since arriving in Central America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt a surprising gratefulness toward her for leading him here however unwittingly ; he felt indebted to her for giving him something to do. # " She never mentioned she was a scientist, " Oscar said, dragging the cloth and its bounty carefully down the slope of the hood. " She called me all the time to talk about the cave, the bones. She wanted me to take her for free, for nothing, and she had no money even to come to Belize! " He clucked his tongue in a rare show of irritation as he brought the bird to the edge of the hood and carefully folded the chamois around its mass. # " Anyway, " Oscar said as he worked, " she wanted to make a Hollywood picture with big money she kept saying she did n't have yet but she would get soon. I think so she wanted to explore the cave system with her own eyes for a movie idea she was working on. In the story, a girl archaeologist discovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real archaeologist but a pretend character she was going to play. The lady Brenda, the actress. " # " Actress, " Kyle said. " She 's an actress? " # " She was very foolish, " Oscar said. " But I think so her idea is very good. The female Indiana Jones. He was very popular with the children of Belize. " # He came to the open door with the bundle, which he lay gently on the truck 's bench seat. " We are sixty miles from the beach, " he said. " Very strange to find this bird here. I wonder what it was looking for, so far away from home. " He lifted the edge of the chamois to reveal the dead animal, its brilliant blue beak and red jowls, its webbed, gleaming, ruby-colored feet. Diggs stirred beside Kyle, peering over at the bird with feigned indifference. # " It 's a red-footed booby, " Oscar said. # " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # " It 's a red-footed booby, " Oscar said. # Diggs slumped back in his seat with a grunt. " Epic, " he said. # With the bird packed away in the truck bed and the sun cresting behind a silver bank of clouds, Oscar bore down on the accelerator with the urgency of a working stiff keen on getting home. Diggs sat in the middle and Kyle brooded in the passenger seat, chin in palm, face pressed against the glass. Two miles down and on the Western side of the road, Kyle spotted a sign of life -- a lone plot of land cleared out of the jungle, with the unfinished concrete foundation of a single-family home protruding like an abandoned machine out of its center. It was the way jungle families built their houses, bit by bit and with every dollar earned ; Oscar had told Kyle that when money ran dry, Belizeans simply stopped building until more came in, forging their lives in increments the best they knew how. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wan but insistent brightness followed them, burnishing the trucks hood with a transcendental glow. Leaning into the window and the flaking leather of the passenger door, Kyle felt a wave of fatigue sweep through his bones. He wondered whether he would bother to tell Patty about the soldiers, his failed attempt at heroism, about Brenda, about any of it. The mere thought of the conversation exhausted him. He was sure shed make some typically snide comment about middle-aged men -- heroes stuck in the back half of their lives -- a message shrouded in humor and wit with a black, cheerless truth at its core. # He imagined her now, sitting in his office, which she admitted to doing when he was away, sipping lukewarm tea from her " Kiss Me I 'm Irish " mug, though she was neither Irish nor particularly affectionate, and he was suddenly relieved at the thought of coming home soon. It was n't that he missed her exactly, but he was glad his wife would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband, either to Mexican drug cartels or to the twin perils of adventure and romance. Patty was n't one for melodrama, and it seemed cruel to subject her to it so late in life. He 'd phone her from the lodge -- of this he was certain -- there would be cool pauses and faintly mocking comments to endure, but at least there was this one known item on his agenda. As he watched the road outside his window, Kyle was seized by a brief rush of queasiness as he realized he was n't sure what he 'd do once he got off the plane bound for home. There were possibilities, practical and impractical. He could learn Mandarin. Adopt a dog, pick apples. He 'd have to remember to ask Patty whether apples were still in season this time of year. # " I 'm not dead yet, " he said aloud, the nausea abating. # Thinking his guest was still distressed by their roadside encounter, Oscar gave a reassuring cluck of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " # Kyle reached across Diggs and poked the barrel of his two fingers into Oscar 's bicep as the young Belizean grasped the wheel in his sure hands, eyes fixed on the road. " Good job, Oscar, " Kyle said. " You really kept your head back there. " # A mile later all signs of dampness and rain were gone, and, as they rode in silence, awash in the flush of the storm 's aftermath, another plot of land with another concrete foundation appeared, and then another, and another, until soon the jungle brush gave way to grassy expanses and dirt roads, and finished homes dotting the landscape with bursts of Caribbean color. There were chicken-wire tracts, several in a row, and bars advertising Coca-Cola and Belikin Beer, a Baptist Church, and rock doves picking at the sand outside the River Mist Inn. Kyle watched two men walking cautiously away from the main road, each balancing a twin-size mattress on his head, and at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright orange moccasins and a traditional Mayan huipil was selling mangoes out of a van. And there were children. Lots of them, emerging from buildings and side streets like fauna in the springtime, without their parents, as if all the grownups were still hibernating in the caves, unable to escape their dreams. The children came alone, in pairs, in small groups, holding hands, pointing at the truck, murmuring to each other, their smiles showing missing teeth. # " Look at that, " Kyle said, to anyone who cared to hear him. # " Kids, " said Diggs. " They sure know how to goof off on a Sunday afternoon. " # Kyle thought they 'd never stop coming, or perhaps he 'd simply not noticed them before. He liked the thought of recognizing something new. There were so many of them, the children -- children carrying enormous babies by the crooks of their armpits, children rolling wheeled toys along the leaf-clogged rain gutters, sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail ties outside the Chinese grocery, children chasing wiry brown dogs down alleyways, children chasing each other, squealing as they ran. * * *
