1006441 There is no love in Istanbul, only the depletions of commerce, the old shoulder of practicality. Not that Yara was looking for love, so she may have missed it, though in Paris that would n't happen, she would have felt its dreamy heat. " The value of a thing is how much you will pay for it, " one rug merchant tells Anshe, looking at the stitching on his woven leather shoes. Anshe slides his feet under the cushion Yara is sitting on and presses his toes up under her so that she feels as if she might tip over onto the heap of rugs they 've endured over apple tea. " You must buy the one you love, " says the dealer. " And I will, " says Anshe blamelessly, rising to leave. There is, naturally, the love of rugs, in Istanbul, but not the kind of love that Yara left behind her in America. <p> Her love would call her, when she was still home, from Mobile. Maybe he would call from somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose small daughter collects monkeys. Or the phone would ring and his voice would stream across the Mississippi River to Chicago from one or the other Dakota. He is n't the man she is traveling with, though she 's trying to love Anshe. And she does, for there are more reasons to than she can count. There is also that kind of love in Istanbul. <p> Yara tries to love Anshe by doing little, consequential favors for him when she thinks of it. She knows, for instance, that he likes to read the Herald Tribune first before she folds the pages backwards into quarters so that she can manage it. She leaves the news beside his coffee cup and pours enough milk for the color to fade from chocolate to toffee. She waits to read until he 's finished, for which he thanks her, noticing. He breaks his bread into pieces and dips it in the soft-boiled egg. Though mostly Anshe does favors for her, larger than hers and more promising, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of kindness that seem to <p> spill from him on her behalf He buys her a bag of anise-flavored candies from the kiosk inside the Egyptian spice market. He loves the way the vials of scented oils from a stall farther in smell on her wrist and asks from time to time if he may hold her hand, which he then turns over and presses to his face so that the hint of patchouli, or sandalwood, or rose water, or the heady concoctions called harem or gypsy waft through his imagination, though she 's right there in person of course, even if her mind wanders. <p> He asks if she prefers the Turkish or Iranian saffron. He holds them toward her so that she may have her choice of long red strands or short golden ones. He likes to present to her the lessons of potentiality, to indicate in his gestures the multitude of options that only he can provide. " A man likes to satisfy the woman he loves, " he tells her, as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she could hold up her end of the other. She prefers the red saffron from Iran that comes in a flat, round jar. She prefers, as a place to sleep and eat, and shop for carpets, the quiet of the old quarter, Sultan Ahmet, down the hill from Haghia Sophia, to the fashionable European district of Beyoglu. <p> Yara also prefers that Anshe not be hurt by what she feels, and so she keeps much of what she feels to herself. Her feelings toward him have the quality of rock candy, she tells herself, indelicate, crystalline. Taken in the mouth perhaps their hardness could dissolve. The syrup of love is not petrified, she passes this line through her head, all the syllables on a single pitch like the end of a dirge. And though her feelings are not amber, neither do they bend to her commitments, which are long standing by now. Twelve years she and Anshe have been together. This is the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early, tells her, tossing her head like a donkey when she laughs. It being a thorough reconsideration of one 's life, Yara takes her to mean. Her friend has three children. She has been sending retouched videos of herself to the hotel room. of Sam Shepard. She tries to compare things that ca n't be compared. <p> Anshe knows the man in America, though refuses to say his name. There is no reason for secrets when nothing, finally, can be hidden. They have spoken on occasion and are not friends. Once, when Anshe came home unexpectedly, he and the unspoken man fought and called each other words about nationality, about shape and size, about aging, and defended territories far beyond their actual borders. They were the picture of each other standing face to face, the one as perfect as the other, though utterly dissimilar, each complete, and this struck Yara as acquisitive on her part, wanting so much perfection for herself. She stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beaded gold bracelet, in the middle of the room. One had to have thrown the first punch, and later their stories agreed precisely as to the one. Neither tried to cheapen the event with hyperbole or heroics ; neither felt wholly defeated. <p> They moved behind a wall, away from her. A fist landing on bone was what you could hear, the dull stretch of muscle against muscle. The grunting sounds of breath being forced by a sudden, abrupt pressure. She moved to look behind the wall where they were fighting and stood for a moment watching them. One 's neck exposed. One 's raging, loved face. It was the first the two men had met. She remembers them pronouncing sounds like cocksucker, sorry-ass, syllables she never could have imagined in either of their mouths, so that the quality of hilarity that overcame her, hearing the one try to denounce the other, seemed only mildly surreal. Under the edge of the mattress on the floor, a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the action, and in the other room began tidying like a kind of domestic dervish. She unplugged appliances, and ran water, and swept crumbs from the table where the man in America and she had been sharing a plate of cheeses and English biscuits. The proofs for a new monograph of his work-images of Desert Stormwhich they had been going over, she stacked behind a row of books on the shelf. All she could think was that the loose pages might be thrown in disdain, and they were the one thing she could protect. The pages floating randomly, unnumbered, she could n't bear to think of this pale disaster in light of the images they bore of soldiers ' obedient braveries. And how ridiculous or merely unhappy the one collecting them would feel remembering them being heaved, remembering the rage that heaved them, the love that provoked the rage, and the miserable loss of love. <p> The man she is traveling with is, Of course, her husband. You knew this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had chosen the kimono she was wearing that day from a roomful of fraying Asian textiles for the way the colors looked against her skin. The day of the fight she dragged the heavy silk of the sleeve in sudsy water, listening to what the two of them were saying. Anshe told the man to leave. His voice sounded like coarse pebbles grinding to dust in his mouth. The other voice had lowered to a growl. When they finished, together, the fighting exhausted in them, she stood near the heat of one man, then moved to examine the swollen face of the other. Any word she might have said felt mannered and abstract when the situation had no manners in it, only freedom and recognition, and what felt like finality. But the end of what, they wondered, each of them shocked by their own participation, each of them horribly serene. It was what it was-a man confronting his wife 's lover. The husband and wife would talk later. The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk too. There would be words then. <p> Calmly, while Yara tidied the rooms, she felt the feudal implications of marriage even this late in the century@ The bonds, the implicit ownership. The fallout of belonging to another. Not that this was the first these implications had occurred to her. She had read Castiglione, Betty Friedan, Germaine Greer, Simone de Beauvoir, but this was clearer. Unless she could deliver the words that would allow her to own the one life she wanted to live, at that moment, and for the rest of her life, she would be property, possessed, and if not by love, then what? If not by love. It was only her choice, but it was not only one choice it had a series of others embedded inside it, and inside those choices, the careful inlay of others. <p> She was no more able, than they were to share her, to take action in an utterance, to proffer the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anshe with his clenched face one inch from the other 's, the stark smell of week-old lilies purpling at the edges, a platinum light slicing itself across the floor through narrow bamboo blinds, the slow thwop of the ceiling fan, what looked like carnations of blood randomly exploding on the walls, a clump of tom hair on the window ledge, water drilling in the steel sink. If she sounds helpless you must try to imagine how she felt as the American gathered his things to go-his eyes cast around the room for his missing photographs, his hands trembled. She felt calm and slow and giddy and profoundly, pathetically owned. <p> Years before that day her feelings had turned to stone, is what it seemed to her, not that they were dormant, but that they were stone. She was aging. She had grown accustomed to the concrete properties of isolation and accumulated sorrows. Life had not been like that for Anshe, nor had it been entirely like that for her. I exaggerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the force of quiet rain over time, and erosion, something had grown from inside that rock. Another thing. Stone or flesh, she thought that day, these are my choices, stone or flesh. But there are rarely only two choices, consoling as it is to think that this one decision will change her life forever. <p> " Nothing hurts when it 's happening, " Anshe tells her later, on the airplane. " You do it, and take it, and do n't feel anything at all, right then. " She thinks, " This is how it is for him. " <p> " He was within his rights, " the man who is not in Istanbul will tell her much later. <p> " I am a peaceful man, " her husband says. " Next time I will smash his face. " <p> Across the Bosperus they could feel it-the wind changing to mark the coming of winter. Meltem from the north, perhaps with rain in it-an invading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold as bullets. The low sun encamps along the Golden Horn. All metaphors speak of the battle which love is. Anshe walks with his arm through hers. He 's holding the umbrella mostly over her head. The misty rain beads in her hair like a net thrown over her. Strands of damp hair coil around her shoulder and the smell of wet wool. It 's not intentional the way her mind travels back to America. Neither is it disciplined. Now he is in Seattle delivering a speech. Now he 's hunting partridge. Yesterday he must have driven into Canada with friends to watch the snow geese migrate, though her days are jumbled and the hours switched. She 's read the papers less and less. The peace prize has been given, at least. Some of the women from the university here in Istanbul want to wear their head coverings to classes and the government prohibits this. So there have been protests, arrests. You see them on the front page of the papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on behalf of their own subjugation. <p> " In a state of constant political precariousness, in a conflict whose only end is violence, certain freedoms we can not allow ourselves, " their driver allegorized on the way from the underground cisterns to the French Embassy at the head of the street where they want to walk. " Certain expressions we can not permit. " He stared at Yara in the rearview mirror. He tooted his horn and blinkered like Turkish drivers do in traffic. <p> There is a steady drizzle now. She looks in the shop windows from underneath the arc of the umbrella as they 're walking. She lets the tips of her fingers run gently over the hair on the back of Anshe 's hand. He is still young and willing and almost inordinately tender. " It is only natural that you would n't feet for me now, " he says, with a sad smile at her touch. He links his fingers through hers. " You love him still. It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way you are. " He 's making what is natural into an act that he can accept, and that she must end. That she must recover from, as he thinks of it. He sees her love of the man in America as an aberration, a wrong turn for someone with an impaired sense of direction. He refers to her affair, which is a matter of time to him, as death is a matter of time. She is a little sick, a little weak. <p> It 's raining harder now and they turn into the English language bookstore on Istiklal Cadessi. " You 're mine, " the man in America said to her once. This enters her head the moment she steps into the warmth of the room filled with books. She wants to be. She takes the wet umbrella from Anshe and places it in a can away from the opulent collection of Ottoman Palace Plans, and Tribal Embroidery, and Maps of the Fallen World. She does n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though his offer has not been withdrawn. <p> On a table near the back of the shop Yara finds a translation of Orhan Pamuk 's new novel and Anshe says over her shoulder while she 's reading, " When we are together is there a part of you that feels you 're betraying him? " This is what she was thinking in the middle of the night as she pulled the sheet over her breasts, that they did not belong to the man asleep beside her, that perhaps when you try to love two men at once your body is no longer entirely your own. She would rather not answer. " Do you? " he persists. She nods, confused about why he would want to know the extent of what he would consider her disloyalty. The book 's cover in the British edition is a drawing of a man whose face is an open book. The sentences of the book have the feel of a smooth translation. She focuses on this. " Well, you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't owe him anything. " <p> Yara had given the American man a celadon green cut velvet scarf that had been made for her by an artist in the city where she lives. The scarf hung over his bed and he burned it when she told him she was leaving for Istanbul. She had written him letters, between phone calls, between the times they 'd been together, which he also burned. She gave him an ivory carving of a fist that had at one time been a snuff box. The hand reminded her of his. When he came to Chicago to see her she placed it in his hand, which closed immediately around it. He studied her face, as if he were unaccustomed to receiving gifts, and then opened his fingers and memorized the small carving carefully before putting it in his pocket, with his knife and money clip. Between the cracks of the fingers, delicate black lines. You can see the suggestion of jealousy in the grip. <p> " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I will feet as if I 've made a mistake. " She thinks of the small fist burning. She has saved everything of his. She feels the loss of her letters more. <p> Anshe asked her to promise not to write to the man while she is in Istanbul. He is trying to love too, and this is what he requires of her to keep at it. Love is n't trading up, is what she has always believed. Love hopes. Well, they do n't know how very well-to love each other. Not to split into the **25;574;TOOLONG parts, and the **27;601;TOOLONG parts. " I want everything in one place, " she tells him. " I want only one life. " <p> " I want you, " he says. He says this at least six times a day, like a call to prayer, so maybe he is good at loving, or remembering to try. Maybe he is calling things that are n't yet into existence, things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows what the date is. Not a birthday, not their anniversary. His face softens and she sees that he is moved by one of his own thoughts. Perhaps by the significance of the day which she forgets. " It is the day I asked you to marry me, " he says, " and tomorrow is the day you said you would. " They 've come all this way, to Istanbul : first Roman Constantinople, then Byzantium, then the Ottomans, fallen to the mesmerizing Ataturk. Now this layer through which the vestiges of others show like scars, like their own unbidden ancestry vying for tradition. <p> They find a perch in a third story window of a student-run mehune overlooking schools of pedestrians on the street below. It 's dusk and fans of white lights have come on in the shape of peacock tails on poles. Girls walk alone in platform shoes, or with a single friend. Dark Turkish youth strolls in fives. The young men talk on cellular phones that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say into the newfound signifier of their significance. Inside Yara and Anshe lean against old cushions made of camel sacks and argue about the usefulness of categorization by gender. In the bookstore he had been scanning a self-help book that makes every effort to explain what women want, and what men want, and the differences between what they want, in terms of brain function. She is more interested in specifics. Charlie-there, she said it-shares her intolerance for astrology, and eneograms, and the breakdown into Venus and Mars-ways to divide and classify that make one moment typify another. When he touches her he is not touching anyone else. <p> " What bothers me about you is your refusal to recognize that you are basically the same as other people, " Anshe goes on. " I do n't like the way you... " <p> " The way I wo n't divide the world in two, " she finishes his sentence. He lets this incongruity between what she does and what she says register, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper : soup and some warm bread. A pitcher of raki. <p> " I love marriage, " she says suddenly, which is diversionary-something she heard another woman say-and too bland to mean anything, and probably especially not I love being married to you. There are ways other than small favors to try love. Willful declarations. And travel is a way to try, as is a move, or for some having a child. There are private ways that involve trying to forget. She ca n't remember, right this minute for instance, the exact date she met him, the city his last letter was mailed from, where she was standing in the picture he made of her. Raki helps forget. The waiter pours three fingers in a tall glass and when she adds water, the liquid turns white. <p> " Like a lion, " the waiter says, scowling ferociously. " Milk of a lion make you roar. " He reaches for her camera on the bench beside her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers, making use of his best English. The whole world conspires to keep what they perceive to be a solid, if not happy, marriage intact. The waiter brushes back his hair to show how hers has fallen into her face. Peering through the viewfinder, he motions them closer to fit into the same frame, and they move together, submissively, as two people might who did n't have a third person there between them. <p> She thinks the waiter may be able to translate her gum wrapper for her, which appears to be a poem, or a rhyming fortune of some sort. She hands him the small square paper with four lines printed on it and asks him to read it aloud. Guzel bir ildir Denizli 10 sim dilik sizli bizli / Ama kismetinde o cikti / Kendisi so1gun benizli. " Ah, " he says, " It means there is a beautiful country far away. In that country lives a man who loves you. He has a white face-I think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man with pale skin. I do n't know how you say this in your language. " She is nodding to encourage him. " But he is, anyway, your love. " The waiter peers up at Yara, then turns to look at Anshe. " Your face is not white, " he says, puzzled, or maybe to console him, before retreating to the kitchen. <p> Next the musicians form part of a circle around their table with their instruments-a hand-held drum, a squash-bellied zither with twelve strings, a long, breathless clarinet. They play, in their distinctive quarter tones, not songs of romance, surely, but songs of Suleyman the 0. magnificence, of Muhammed 's journey into the Seven Heavens, songs of spiritual starvation is what they sound like. <p> " You look apprehensive, " Anshe lets his mouth brush her ear and raises his voice over the din. <p> Yara shakes her head. Regrettably the musicians move to the next table. <p> " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under his eyes. His fine, aquiline nose. The way the light from the sheepskin lamps make his chin look like it is carved from granite. He has begun to believe that he can read her mind. It 's one of her strategies, to let him think he can. <p> " Fighting did n't solve anything, did it? " she shouts, going along. Though what she 's actually thinking is, tongue 's spice, row of teeth, even breath, the way the words you 're mine embroider the heart with delicate, worn threads. When Anshe mentions it she begins to think, it shames her to admit, that all of them being in the same room may have been exactly what she 'd secretly wanted-the three of them together so that she would n't have to leave part of her life in one place while she went away to live the other part. It 's utterly selfish, she knows, to want a thing like that. The musicians cease at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm grateful no one was hurt, worse, " Anshe says, showing her the place on the heel of his hand that has almost scarred over after a month. A chunk of skin had been gouged out-teeth or fingernail marks or a scrape against exposed brick. She thinks of the man in America 's swollen jaw. He could n't shave. In her mind she places her hands gently on his two-day growth of beard. The fight had made being together for them feel slightly dangerous. They walked down the back stairs to avoid someone standing guard at the elevator. He pulled his car around behind his apartment to the alleyway, where Yara got in. <p> Each day over her own soul 's objections she tries to let the way she feels about the man in America tarnish in some diminishing, occluding way. She imagines the future unraveling between them into skeins of regret for what they would have to abandon. She tries to make the certain pressure of his focus, the demands of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the close smells of frying fish in the market. She places a woman who would like to be her rival in bed with him, the eager hump of her ass lifted toward the ceiling. What if the accidental re-ignition of an old desire? She resorts to the potential eventualities of disease, the depredations of old age. What if a paralyzing accident? She ca n't impute, or wo n't, impotence. <p> Even the rug dealers in Istanbul speak of the symbols of harmonious longevity. Bereket, a fertile union, as evidenced in figs and pomegranates, poppies, heads of grain. Bukco, which means fetter, the sign of permanent union. El, Parmak, Tarak( hand, finger comb), all these warring against the influence of the evil eye, the degradation of the holy union, as does Congel( hook), they are assured over apple tea. Hayat Agad-the tree of life, means going on and on-the dealers move their hands in circles. They tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woven as a wedding gift. They say its value is precisely what you 'll pay. <p> Yara and Anshe have been traveling together for over a month now, in and around Istanbul, city of new beginnings forced on one people by another. Travel is a world of comfortable shoes and phraseology. It involves the fair and unfair exchange of currency, gestures of strangeness, hospitality. It is meant to trigger, at the end of the road, a longing for home. On their way out of the restaurant, after they have finished drinking the lion 's milk, a young man wearing a bright red vest shakes lemon scented water into their hands to splash onto their faces. She is certain it is a ritual meant to carry them together into the eternal future, like throwing rice at a bride and groom. <p> " Can you say you think that you 'd like to try to love me? " Anshe asks quietly behind her on their way down the curved iron stairs. There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the railing in order not to slip, and keeps going. " I am trying, " she says, which has never been enough, and still is n't she can see in the grim shudder of the night that spreads before them. <p> I know you 're trying, " he says it patiently. " But do you want to try? " <p>
