4121641 Translated from Russian by Sylvia Maizell <p> As a type, if only at first glance, he was simply an honest fellow and an enthusiast. But life has a way of pinning labels on us. Life is crude. It forces us to define ourselves more narrowly. And that 's why at his research institute the aging Victor Sushkov came across as that familiar type we aU know from the ' 60s and ' 70s. He was, as everyone around used to joke, a " Champion of Human Rights, " running up and down the corridors. Once he 'd been a Komsomol stalwart. Once a trade union activist. And now he was this nice, spry, little old guy. <p> The minute he got wind of some injustice by the bosses, some ugly business or the usual kicking around of an ordinary employee, he was off coUecting signatures. This had n't changed. StUl the old guard. Mostly fussing about, I 'll admit. But aU the same, on a few occasions, he kept someone from being fired and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman from being pushed around. And it goes without saying, he was a good famUy man. Engineer Sushkov, who coUected signatures at the drop of a hat. From floor to floor, rushing around, running along the corridors of the institute, his eyes so serious. That 's how he should have been remembered, is n't that so? But, alas, he was getting older. A sense of uselessness showed through in his little honest eyes. Of something pitiable. And he no longer demanded, but begged. In his hands, as usual, a piece of paper. With a letter. With an application. With a protest. And with his baUpoint pen at hand, he 'd call someone aside and plead, " Wo n't you sign, please. " <p> But the people in the corridors? what a bunch! Though most of them, it seemed, were worse than Victor, they were sure they were better. We 're all like that. When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people, his associates, made faces behind his back. And among themselves summed him up, that Soviet-style romantic : " A pain in the ass. He never stopped pushing. " <p> And then there was Victor Odintsov, a friend of Victor Sushkov in his youth. As a type, he was just the opposite, a real loner. And not at all a big talker. Quiet. Such a strapping, unsociable man. A secretive and lucky seducer of young ladies. <p> This rather gloomy Odintsov was a bachelor. He was, right up to his retirement, a photographer. But not first class. Just a job. He ran a photo studio, which in those times meant something. A maestro. A man who was more or less famous if you hung around the Taganskaya metro. <p> The staff at the studio was small : a body-builder guard and three or four girls, not more. These delicate female hands used to help Odintsov in his photo work and to straighten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The girls were not at all bad looking. You could see that right away from the street through the large window of his small studio. <p> Since it was the boss himself who decided who would stay for this simple work and who would not, the girls were fully dependent on him and he made full use of it. Once in two years the gloomy, solitary Odintsov changed his contingent and once again made the most of it. A smooth operator! It 's curious that he carried out all this casually, almost unwillingly. With a gloomy face, and quietly. That 's the kind of man he was. He bedded one, he bedded another. For some reason he would begin with the most timid, homely one. Or else he bedded two at once, diversifying the week. Yet, it seems, also without passion. Also calmly. Just so his itch got scratched.( Well, you ca n't have great love every day.) <p> Once at midday I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I asked the earnest workers where Victor Olegovich was. I was wondering if the old gray-haired badger had gone out to lunch and whether he had said something. <p> " Said something? So he knows how to speak? " one of the girls threw at me, and they all began to giggle in chorus. <p> " How about going fishing? For a couple of days, how about it? " the talkative Victor Sushkov would ask the gloomy Victor Odintsov. He 'd call him. And they would make an appointment, usuaUy after they got their pension checks. <p> " Let 's go. " <p> Going fishing meant sitting with fishing rods and having a little drink. RecaUing their youth. Turning nostalgic. And what else was there for two, at long last, pensioners to do? They had come up with a fantastic idea! They told the whole world to get lost. Having stocked up with food, they sat and waited for a fish to bite. An escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? apidated hut. <p> Sometimes I visited them too. <p> But there was something else they used to talk about. Something amazing. Both men anticipated their own longevity. They discovered this unexpectedly. As it turned out, their grandmothers and grandfathers had lived to a hundred. Well, what do you think, does n't this obUge one to live on! Does n't this inspire one? And so even now, in retirement, the lives of both Victors were in no way ending, their whole long lives were still ahead. <p> When the two of them, carried away, began to talk about intimate things, it seemed they both went slightly nuts. They got all fired up! Longevity became their obsession, their little fixation. Their exclamation point. Revealing, at last, the meaning of their existence. <p> By the way, Victor Sushkov and I also could have chatted about this or that. He was my feUow townsman. From the Orenburzhye region, and even the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at our rods. Swigging vodka. Recalling special words. Bringing to life the forgotten woods, the h? ls? the geography of our chUdhood. <p> Not a chance! Most often it was they? the two Victors? who led the conversations. You could n't cut them off. Gloomy Odintsov had also become talkative at about that time. Just think, having retired! It was precisely longevity, and what 's more, competing as to who would outlast the other, that became their favorite subject. The long-long future days, that 's what drew them. That 's what stirred their thoughts as they sat idly, angling by the stream. The future beckoned. The future, almost endless, awaited them, and they walked forward boldly to meet it. After aU, the pension was enough. What else could they need? <p> This prospect of the future gripped them like, say, gambling. Or sailing. They caught the wind. I hardly understood them. But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A certain abstract, radiant horizon. It was impossible not to feel their intense delight, the thrill of an unexpectedly found treasure. <p> And the playful " gifts " they gave one another! The wills! It really was a kind of passionate game. The intellectual sport of idle old men. This sophisticated ritual unfolded picturesquely : both Victors, immensely proud, would exchange " papers, " texts they had written themselves. From hand to hand, elegantly. With a witness, perhaps myself, these texts were read aloud.( When you know you 'll five a hundred years, leaving a will is a great joy, no doubt.) Out loud by a fire. With pleasure. With satisfaction. Repeating key words. Slippery legal terms. Convoluted sentences. All the jibberish of a notary 's office. <p> The wills were read aloud, reread, laughed at, and burned. Here it was, our legacy. Burn away! A good thing the fire was close by. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies. At first, as if teasing the " heir, " they hesitated? just held a corner of the paper at the very edge of the fire. The tongues of flame stretched out and licked it. Finally the fire would reach it. Would grab it. At a certain point the fire would swallow up this opus which disappeared instantly, but which flirted so audaciously with eternity. <p> " And here 's some more. Listen! " <p> " So? " <p> " It 's my gift to you. Look, believe me, I 'm tearing out a piece of myself! " That 's how one of the Victors would begin to read aloud to the other his new bequest. <p> The life of a man and the life of a thing. The impossibility, or perhaps, after all, the possibility, of standing up to Time. In some oblique way both of these coexisted in their little game. I would n't go so far as to say that " homo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. That 's small-minded, is n't it? It 's more likely the opposite. These oldtimers were amused by the powerlessness of things. The fatality of things. It teased them. It tickled them. And there was nothing, nothing they would n't give away! So citizen Victor Odintsov bequeathed after his remote death to citizen Victor Sushkov his old Zhiguli which, as both knew quite well, would n't last another two-three years. In another " document " he left his namesake a china tea set, inexpensive, but fragile, which was reduced, as we aU knew, cup by cup, in our frequent tea-drinking by the stream. And when we were plastered too. We drank everything from cups. <p> On the other hand, Victor Sushkov, like aU veteran romantics, was unable to focus on what had value and most often bequeathed to citizen Victor Odintsov : Miscellaneous... a worn-out area rug( that would be " borrowed " from the haUway of their research institute), A Book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner store. It was thrown unceremoniously right out the window. Into the grass). A nasty correspondence of a certain citizen Bobrov with the housing office. In their frenzied need to keep on giving gifts they would bequeath any object that fell into their hands, and underfoot, including rubbish. An empty bottle of fine cognac. A bum 's boot. An Azerbaijani 's cloth cap. <p> They gave to each other, but suddenly stuff began to come my way, too, so I would n't feel left out. Those maniacs! Their heads spun from the unthinkably long years of their grandfathers. They were carried away by their own vitaUty and the possibility of living forever. <p> At times their exuberance suddenly seemed forced. A bit too much, reaUy. But still they were having a good time. And besides, you see, there was w? derness aU around. In the middle of nowhere. Who would n't want to live here forever. An abandoned stream. By a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so often in the ranks of our wornout and lost old folk. Among the hundreds and hundreds of whiners. Among the thousands complaining about their sores! <p> Competing in an absurd generosity, and not doubting he 'd outlive everyone, Victor Sushkov, sitting by the fire, once gave me, just get a load of this, an " official " paper where, in his right mind and sound memory, he w? led after his death not just any old thing, but his apartment. It seemed he no longer knew what to give. He would have given away everything. He was bursting with generosity. He just kept chuckUng. But he himself did n't throw anything into the bonfire, did n't give anything to the flame. How brave of him, do n't you think? Sure, it was a trifle. Sure, not notarized. But aU the same, a document. I even teased him by holding the paper near the flame. But I did n't burn it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my pocket. <p> However, Victor Sergeevich Sushkov, who was playfully tossing around his property, was n't risking anything at all. He knew he 'd outlive me - that was clear. And by a long shot at that. One of his grandfathers had lived exactly to one hundred, another even jumped across, hurdled, leaped over that strange psychological barrier? 101! To say nothing of Victor 's ancient grandmothers, always bustling about. They were aficionados of a good meal. Pancakes. Pickles. Potatoes. If you stuff yourself on foods starting with? you 'll live longer! Having buried their husbands, the old grannies, of course, also died at some point. But they died not keeping count of their years at all.( Excuse me? reaching 105.) What good was counting? What sense did it make, without husbands, for them to know or not know their number on a turned-off stopwatch? <p> Therefore it was n't worth it to hope for the square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope. Not even to hope in secret. Victor Sushkov absolutely assured me that he 'd die as his grandfathers had died? after a hundred years and in his sleep. He would die happily. Just like all of them. <p> And then again there was this Vas-Vasilich. Also one of us. Also potentially long-lived. One of the old buzzards who came to fish with us. We were all friends in our youth. He, too, got strangely excited by the entrancing evening talks by the fire. And the air from the stream. And the booze. <p> This Vas-Vasilich kept trying to rein in both Victors, if only slightly? their game, he would say, was not good. It meant trouble. It was dangerous. Vas-Vasilich himself was much more guarded about playing around with the heavens. Also born to live long, he, on the contrary, did n't gab away his future. He cherished it. He protected it. Reticent, he had selected another tactic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " There 's no way I 'd live long. Come on! If only I could squeak by five more years! " <p> And in a deliberately superstitious way, sighing and moaning, Vas-Vasilich twisted his thin, sly mouth : <p> " If only I 'll crawl past seventy. " <p> In the morning there were those venerable fishermen 's tall tales - a pike got away - half a kilo of perch - a perch was already doing somersaults on the shore... now it 's in the grass!? Why do n't you tie up his hands so he would n't show how big the perch was? We walked to the stream to check the deep-water fishing rods. The stream was narrow and poUuted, typical for the Moscow area. StUl, Victor Sushkov had two perches. And Vas-VasUich had two. And I even had three, and what huge ones! <p> But for lonely Odintsov, not even a ripple.( Three perches! Who could get over that? Three? that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind.) Victor Olegovich Odintsov got angry : <p> " You lucky son of a bitch! " The former photographer shook his finger at me. <p> We laughed. And he, continuing our last talk, you see, again recalled his living grandfathers. And he threatened me : <p> " You ll pay for that piece of good luck. Ten years for each perch. I'U outlast you by thirty years? do you hear me? " <p> We laughed again. <p> It was sunrise. The stream nestled in green. Everything Ut up. The shore gleamed. Why quibble? Outlive me by as long as you like! The sun on the water? now that 's worth a hundred years! <p> Sometimes Victor Odintsov came to his former photo studio. He came but did n't go in. Nothing there for an old fellow to do. From the street he would look over the new girls. They were at their posts. They were aU brand new. Alas, he no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes without saying. And there was no longer the former pleasure of selecting. Life changes. Yet, the big window, a large glass without a single crack, was the same. By squinting, he had a splendid view of the young toUers, who were deftly settling their Uttle buns on swivel chairs. No matter what you do? glass is transparent! As if admiring some publicity shots, gray-haired Victor Olegovich Odintsov kept standing there. He looked, and why not? He was n't rushing anywhere. <p> Victor Sergeevich Sushkov, a pensioner, at sixty-eight, died at home? suddenly and in his sleep. He did n't twitch, he did n't wake his wife. He did n't alarm anyone. He died in his sleep and content. <p> It was only afterwards that the doctors explained to the relatives that it was a stroke. <p> In his sleep, just as he had promised. You see, his timing was off and he jumped the gun. He did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In comparison with his grandfathers he did it way too soon. Well, these things happen. But at least in his sleep. <p> And so he died and so what : it would have been as usual. They would have had their cry, cremated him, everything that normal people do. And they would have gone on living. He was n't the first. Except for one fine point. They found his will. It turned out that Victor had left a few lines regarding his possible death. <p> Most likely it was impromptu, a certain something, a certain blip of his soul. A fantasy. Most likely it was a continuation ofthat game of writing beautifully composed documents? a flirting with the future. The game always draws its players. He sat down and it was done. Not knowing exactly why. He dashed it off. Just like that. <p> It would have been better, of course, if they had n't found his brief composition altogether, or found it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funeral, after a little time went by. <p> But now the plot began to unfold : Victor 's sister, an exemplary, respectable lady, a high school teacher, noticed a familiar handwriting that pricked her heart. A particular slope of the letters that she recognized from childhood. She read it through? oh, so that 's what it was! Victor, her elder brother, in his right mind and of sound memory, wrote that after his death he willed to be buried in his native Orenburzhe, in the ruined village where his grandfathers each lived to a hundred, and where for ages and ages since, there had been no houses or walls or even chimneys sticking out forlornly. But still there was a cemetery. For the time being. The remains of an old cemetery, which he, Victor, had visited with great interest about two years before. <p> Victor Sushkov, even in play, and I 'm sure the will was for fun, remained a romantic. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something he had seen in the cemetery, crosses slumped over there like drunks, he said. <p> Victor Sergeevich even counted them the way they did it in the old days. He did n't write there were eight, or say, around ten of them. He added a postscript : the ones that were n't falling were n't many, he said. Not quite enough were left, fewer than a dozen. Crosses. <p> As much as the family loved him, they were stunned. They cried, they grieved, but upon rereading the part about the dozen old crosses, which were one thousand kUometers away, Victor Sushkov 's widow and his now grown chUdren fell to thinking. It was a difficult business. A certain inconvenience had come up. There was no time to lose. The dead man could n't lie around long. It was summer. And sunny. You could n't keep stretched out there to your heart 's content. <p> Let 's suppose they 'd spend a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But a special train car? And who would accompany the coffin? Who would transport it thirty-six hours all the way to Orsk? Quite something, eh? The relatives were suffering because of the deceased. But now they were struggling twofold : the loss, and on top of that the impossib? ity of carrying out his last fooUsh, reaUy foolish, wish. They regretted that they had found this note of a w? l altogether? if only it had turned up a week later! Even his sister, the greatest stickler for the rules, a teacher, a pedant and all the rest, who at first had lashed out at the others and demanded they carry out the wiU of the deceased, now even she did n't insist on it. She somehow lost steam. <p> Everyone around let up even more. At first in a whisper, then with a blast, they aU condemned Victor Sushkov : What a shit! What on earth did he cook up! Such trouble for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own sister too! <p> " The ch? dren w? l do it. I 'll do it. We'U carry out his wishes, " his strict sister, the teacher, kept repeating to them, but she did n't sound so convinced anymore. The fam? y gene was no longer looking out for him. It was down to the wire. Having talked it over again, at last without any hysteria and demands, they decided among the kin first of aU to simplify the problem : to have him cremated. <p> And then to bury the ashes. That was quite a different matter. To bury him without such nervous haste and, oh, yes, in faraway Orenburzhe. As he wished. As he requested. In the old cemetery of his grandfathers. <p> Having him cremated? this was even more proper. Having an old pensioner, who had left such an inspired w? l, cremated, now that was absolutely right in style. To cremate, burn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life coUected signatures in defense of the downtrodden seemed to correspond to something lofty. After all, the very element itself? the triumph of fire! Flame! Ashes! <p> They had him cremated. <p> The Khovansky crematorium, if you do n't give much thought to what goes on there, of course, also sounded absolutely sublime. What names, the Khovanskys and the MUoslavskys, those ancient nobles! Who has n't heard of them! But suddenly it turned out that something again got screwed up. There was just no winning. Our Victor was out of luck, the old guy was plain out of luck! <p> For a start, how do you like that, dear relatives, another name came up? Techkin. Frankly speaking, not the most elevated name? something like citizen Estrus. It grates on the ear. But it sure began to make a noise. And how! In the newspaper Argumenty ifakty. A scandalous, for those days, expos? of the funeral director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not? Was he drunk or not? They skewered him in the paper this way and that. They kept skewering him even after the poor dev? was fired. They were merdless. " What an artisan! " " Techkin, the efficiency expert! " That 's how they tore into him. With such a frigging surname, get the hell out, you serf? out of the fiery-ashen Khovansky domain! <p> This Techkin, as it turned out, was burning four bodies per session. After which he divided up the unique human ashes any old way into four little piles. <p> It all came to light, of course, but accidentaUy. One of his clients, who was taking away the ashes of a relative, cremated that very same Saturday as our Victor Sushkov, got confused and mixed up the time. He turned up at the incinerator too early. WeU, what was the rush! Plus he kept looking at his watch. <p> For some reason no one stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Friday! Then he began to look around on his own. To muster up courage he even whistled a bit. He was searching and ended up in the wrong place. Not where the white urns were waiting, but by chance came directly to the raker of ashes, that is to Techkin 's fiefdom. <p> Some tried to exonerate the funeral director : " Hey, look, it was Friday, he was drunk, soaked to the g? ls. But, certainly, he 's no monster. He 's a human being! It was n't out of spite. " Nonetheless, it turned out difficult even to explain whether the pickled Techkin was too lazy to rake out each one separately. Had he made a mistake? And how did he pull this off altogether? How, having violated the strictest technology, did he mix up the remains? Impossible! <p> But a fact is a fact : at close range, the client saw it with his own eyes and was flabbergasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, silently, with his enormously long poker, was dividing ashes into four little piles. <p> How Victor Sergeevich Sushkov 's relatives were appalled! It was bad enough they had oversimplified the last wish of the deceased by cremating him. And now, of all things, from the stove they got handed ashes which were three quarters someone else 's. And that 's if arithmetic works here. If simple arithmetical fractions also apply to ashes. You see, at least if it were an accurate quarter. <p> But what to do now! What? Everyone walked around gloomy. They did n't look at each other : " Did we inherit at least a little something that belonged to us in the urn we finally got? " It was almost a metaphysical question, which would at times arise and which especially aggravated the sons of Victor Sushkov, by now already grown men. Especially the youngest, a twenty-five-year-old, who was hungry for battle. The tallest, though the youngest, threatened to track down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a pulp with his own damned poker. <p> The youngest became glum. A glum but handsome lad. The point is, on top of everything else, it fell to his lot to transport the white urn to the fields of Orenburzhe. <p> I was at their place on that night. Victor 's widow and his strict sister, the teacher, were puttering around in the kitchen. They were clattering the dishes, worried about the upcoming meal. They did n't participate in the selection. They were n't even invited. <p> " Pyotr Ivanich! " The women started to call me into the kitchen as well. But I did n't go. There was no reason to. <p> The drawing of lots took place right away. I looked on. Rolled-up bits of paper with the sons ' names were taken out of a white panama hat. Only one person. No, really, each one had his own schedule. You could n't expect the brothers to leave all together. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone at once? <p> I tried to reassure the youngest one, telling him how wonderful that place was. What grass, what willows! Yes, yes, what old, creaking willows hung there over the river. Pitiful and gnarled, they stood in total isolation. You bet they were bored. They creak... those willows... It 's possible the deceased Victor also had them in mind in his note. In his will. An inconsiderate one, to be sure. <p> The youngest son kept stUl, gritting his teeth for a second. But he was hardly reacting to the old willows over the river. Most likely he kept thinking about Techkin, who was stirring up trouble with a poker in his hand over a hot p? e of common ashes. Moron! Drunk! Skitzo! <p> And I, what do you know, went on talking. I 'd become too talkative in those days. I could n't shut up. Now I went on describing the route to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, which, by the way, he knew himself. Up to Orsk. And then another hour and forty minutes to the sidetrack on a dreary, local train. And from there five kilometers more on foot. Almost five. I sketched a Uttle map on a piece of paper. I drew arrows pointing to where an overgrown road suddenly straightened out and where there was the one and only turn by a dried-up ravine. You ca n't miss it, you know. Five kUometers. But after aU it 's ashes you 're carrying, not a coffin. I also said to him : just think how heavy it could have been. Picture it. Just think how you three sons would hunch over walking bad roads with a coffin on your shoulders. <p> " I do n't even want to think about it, " the youngest one answered firmly. <p> I also told Victor Sushkov 's youngest son about what the winter was like there. The surrounding fields, including the cemetery. And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leaning crosses would n't be noticeable right away. Although, of course, it 's no big deal to chop out a hole for an urn. With what? No problem. Not a shovel but a sapper spade. Take one along with you. <p> Probably there was no stopping me. <p> The son held himself back. Then he said under his breath : <p> " I hope you do n't think I 'm going to take that urn over there in the winter. " <p> But it was pensioner Victor Odintsov who became especiaUy talkative in those days as a result of the death of pensioner Victor Sushkov. From a sense of loss. Of deprivation. He now was obhged to live and sustain his longevity for two. He even copied Sushkov 's intonation. It seems his old friend had bequeathed him his light, sUghtly hurried manner of speech. <p> It 's hard to make sense of a sudden death. Victor Odintsov was shaken. And now he was analyzing, trying to figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly, his namesake and friend of his youth had so offended nature. His fellow old-timer had died before his time. But this could n't have happened by itself. This could n't be by chance. Considering his heredity. His genes. And at a mere sixty-eight. Nonsense. <p> He came up with an explanation. It went like this : The deceased, Victor Sushkov, unlike him, Victor Odintsov, had little interest in women. He did n't indulge himself in a casual female caress, the most hungry of all caresses. Recharging us. Giving us strength. A woman 's bed? that was energy itself. Side by side. Even a battery charges up better prone.( Just a joke.) A wife. A wife, as we all know, is also a woman. But still, why at sixty-eight! Oh, Victor! Victor! Why did you hurry so? You could have lived on and on. If only... Victor Sushkov, if the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignored women, and nature, also a woman, soon subdued him. She got her revenge. <p> No, no, Victor Olegovich Odintsov did not condemn his old friend. And how could anyone in this case? Why, he himself, lonely Odintsov, grown old, also had n't nourished himself on romance of late. He was n't dating anyone. Not one. He did n't think about women, having switched over to beer. He had found something to keep him happy. " What an idiot! Oh no, you wo n't get away with that! It 's enough! " he told himself. <p> Now he understood everything. And tallied everything. Even a pensioner, in a pinch, can scrape up some rubles and spend them sensibly. Sure, now Victor Odintsov, alas, had to run around and search. Accustomed as he was in former times in his photo studio to an easy exchange of partners, now he would have to suffer somewhat in his quest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more modest in his choices, but... but he 'd get by. G-E-T- B-Y. He had to fight for his life somehow. <p> Actually, he was able to find a way very soon. The times made it possible. <p> " To find a way to a paid beauty turned out fairly simple. It 's all a matter of experience. Do n't you remember what a pro I was! " <p> We remembered. <p> " And it 's good, too, that my tongue suddenly loosened up. Like a shoelace. Without a good line you ca n't buy a decent cat, let alone a chick, " he complained to us pointedly. <p> To us, that was myself and Vas-Vasilich. <p> But then, and I remember this well, Victor Olegovich Odintsov smiled significantly. He rubbed his hands. Taking out a notebook, he sat closer to the phone. He put on his glasses. He took a good look and sighed : <p> " Oh-ho-hoooo-o! " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olegovich debated out loud with himself : <p> " There 's that boy Vova and there 's that boy Sema. Sema was recommended to me just recently. " <p> It seemed to me the old dimwit had turned queer. I even gasped. Maybe grief had damaged his brain. But it turned out that both Sema and Vova were small-time pimps. " Guides, " as the old maestro of photographic matters called them simply. Young guys who had some fast broads at their instant beck and call. <p> " Do you mean right now? " <p> " Sure. Why wait. " Gray-haired Victor winked knowingly. <p> We hesitated. <p> " Maybe another time? " <p> " Absolutely not. Out of the question. Sex is n't a bath. You do n't put off sex till the day after tomorrow. To get laid, let 's round out this talk. Let 's get going. " <p> He was convincing. <p> " Come on now. All you couch potatoes? when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It seemed that right then and there, in his ramshackle apartment, we could get gratification. Without any inhibitions. In the open and honestly. Not just any old way. And after all, we were his guests and a guest, even fasting, can indulge in something tasty. Without preliminaries. In the modern way. <p> " Well, what else do you have to do? " Victor Olegovich, by now all heated up, pressed his case <p> It was true we had nothing else planned for that day. And it was obvious we had no intention of going anywhere. Except to our homes. To the television. And since morning the fishing trip had already fallen through. The wind kept howling in the streets. <p> Even Vas-Vasilich cheered up a bit and took on a swagger, that old fogy who also aimed at longevity, but in his own distinctive way. Quietly. The one who viewed the future piously, modestly, even humbly. " Oh, well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few coins. " <p> " How am I doing- Not well, not well at all! " Vas-Vas-ich would complain right from the threshold, having barely entered, waving away the smoke of our cheap cigarettes. <p> And he shook hands limply. <p> " I 'm sick again. Again my side hurts. " <p> " Cut it out! " <p> " What 's this ' cut it out ' - Easy for you to say " was the reply. " You 're in good shape. It 's you there, fat face, who 'll last longer! " <p> Or else : <p> " Easy for you all to say. You 're just like dragon slayers! But my liver is acting up again. I 'm just about to kick off! And my kidneys are up to something. " <p> With his wretched, cautious whining he was clearly trying to appease his own little god stacked away somewhere in the heavens, up there in the high white clouds. He was playing some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We knew him inside out. <p> So that now, when this sex deal was being struck, Victor Odintsov did n't pass up the opportunity to inquire about our health with a concerned smirk : <p> " Vas-Vasilich! How about you- Wo n't a young beauty do you in- " <p> " I do n't think so, " Vas-Vas-ich responded soberly. <p> " And what about your kidneys? " <p> Without letting him answer, Victor said with conviction : <p> " The kidneys are soldiers. The main thing is you must be sure of yourself. If you 're sure - if you 're one hundred percent sure - well then your soldiers, as one, w-l fight to the bitter end. " <p> Victor Olegovich Odintsov knew how to live life. He knew how to prolong it. He did n't want to hear any more about Vas-Vasllich 's kidneys and other woes. The hell with the kidneys! He spoke about women. A woman - now that 's a miracle. A woman - that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prolongs our lives. <p> " Well- Should I go ahead and call- " Victor Olegovich caressed the telephone receiver in anticipation. <p> He laughed out loud and teased : <p> " She 'll come over now, that chick. Sooo - young! How about it? " <p> However, his own life did n't last long. It 's sad. Evidently women came too late. Women short-changed Victor on his impetus. Or maybe women do n't influence longevity at all. It 's a mystery. One way or another, Victor Odintsov outlived his namesake Victor Sushkov by a mere half a year. But - at sixty-nine. He died of a heart attack. In the metro. <p> That girl had an unusual name - Alekhandra, and she was over fifty. We 're talking money, not age. But we could only afford the one at twenty. <p> Sweet, good-looking, from the Sumsky province. Dazzlingly bare knees, enticing with their southern tan, adorable, really adorable - but at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! Vas-Vasilich even lost his temper : " Why such a high price! Why this Latino-Moscow name- We do n't need it. Old-timers are n't ambitious. Our aesthetic is simple. " <p> But the pimp who brought her - Sema or Vova - I do n't remember, kept smiling and stroking the girl. He encouraged us at first with words, then with action. Putting his hand on her neck and simply bending her over, he got Alekhandra all ready. With her backside to us. And without further ado, he lifted up her mini-skirt. There was nothing underneath, or, should we say, there was everything. <p> He moistened his index finger with saliva and still with a smile announced : <p> " A trick. " <p> And he ran his finger. Like an artist with his brush. He ran his finger from the top down along her closed lips, closed for now, or so it was understood. I have to say he did it tenderly. For fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand. And a miracle happened. <p> The fellow snapped his fingers : <p> " A trick! " and with that the lips parted. <p> She stood, bent over calmly, and her exposed little nook was a thing unto itself. Like a mouth. Like lips parting in thirst. Parched, they yearned to be quenched. We old-timers were dumbfounded. <p> Two of us stood gawking, while I gripped the table. <p> Late bloomers, beginning to age already under the reds, we quite understandably found ourselves suddenly rattled. We had gaps in our education. Nothing about sex away from home. We had never seen a door open all by itself. There was a lot we had n't seen. <p> Certainly time had shot forward. And now we were making up for what we had missed. But to make up for something did n't mean to catch up with it. We were also losing out to this snotnose kid Vova. And his Alekhandra. And at this point there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand, we had something instead to look forward to. On the other hand, what an advantage we had in the future! That is, the distant future. There was n't even the slightest doubt that our sin-deprived generation( comporting itself properly, on the whole) would get credit in heaven. Just for the good things. If only there had n't been so much thievery. In every corner of our lives. <p> Were it not for thievery of all kinds, most of us, " homines Sovietici, " would get to heaven eas-y. We 're simply cut out for heaven. Well-disciplined. Most of us, I 'm convinced, would find ourselves in heaven right away and directly, without any checkpoints. Without even any inquiry. <p> We were struck dumb, but the vertical door opened just a crack more. And it waited. That 's when we thought of heaven. Of entry into heaven. There it was. We looked. We were struck dumb and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm telling you - without any inquiry. High school gold and s-ver medalists, that 's us! <p> It was a blow to the head. It somehow rattled something there. It 's too bad we had n't had a drink before this. Not a drop. We really needed one. But Victor was afraid for us and did n't give us anything ahead of time. So perceptive of him. " Wine w-l relax you too much, " he said. <p> Right then and there the fellow unzipped his faded jeans, took it out and inserted it. Right before our eyes. <p> " Well? " he said. <p> With three or four thrusts, he restored the erotic image. After all, he was only demonstrating. He was reminding us. It 's possible, he thought, we had forgotten some things. He kept on glancing at us as if to say is everything clear. Then he coughed dryly and, straightening up the girl, took away the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her bottom just kept on gleaming. <p> For another moment they stood side by side, waiting calmly. And only then, having pulled down her skirt, did she turn around and we could see her cold-eyed face. <p> " No. Fifty 's too much, " Victor Olegovich Odintsov barely got out through dry lips. <p> We were silent. We breathed. We heard each other 's breathing. <p> The fellow and the girl headed toward the door : <p> " C'm on, c'm on, Alekhandra! These fuck-heads are gon na stay like stone for a good four days. Can you imagine their dicks right now! " <p> At the door he turned around : <p> " So what do you want - some cheap ones? " <p> Victor Odintsov swayed, trying to keep his balance. Suddenly he leaned his hand on the table. Pale, he, however, repeated what he had said : <p> " Twenty, that 's the top. Not more. " <p> The fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @.... But do n't count on it. If I get hold of one, I 'll buzz you. " AuthorAffiliation <p> VLADIMIR MAKANIN is a writer of novels and short stories.
