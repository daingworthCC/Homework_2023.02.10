1000741 A Woman 's Litany of Cries in the Night <p> A Lamaze Certified Childbirth Educator, Sally Lochowski Tanaka uses poetry " to communicate the emotional aspects of birthing and parenting to clients, patients, and colleagues. " Here, in her own poem, Sally touches on the poignant stages of motherhood. " Pregnant women relate to the first verse as they anticipate the newborn coming soon into their lives, " she says. " Moms with other children find they can identify with the later stages of mothering. And grandmothers recognize the full circle of caring for -- and letting go of -- a beloved child. " <p> Out of the night floats the cry of the newborn -- <p> Hesitant, halting, a newly-formed sound, <p> Encouraged by hunger and cold unfamiliar. <p> Calling for Mother, her womb to reopen <p> Calling for Mother, her breasts warm and round. <p> Now from the dark breaks the wail of the infant -- <p> Gums hot and swollen, erupting inside, <p> Pounding, relentless, the teeth slowly push through. <p> Calling for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother, her arms open wide. <p> Up from the depths rise the screams of the toddler -- <p> Haunted by bad thoughts that march through the dream, <p> And burst through the conscience, then into the dark room. <p> Calling for Mother to scare away monsters <p> Calling for Mother to come stand between. <p> Slowly from slumber sifts the moan of the child -- <p> Tremors of fever, cheeks flushed, body sore, <p> Seeking a cool hand, a word gently spoken. <p> Calling for Mother, the soother, the healer <p> Calling for Mother to come walk the floor. <p> In the dim twilight mute sobs rack the young teen -- <p> Heart nearly broken, cruel words from a friend, <p> Spurned by a new love, not ready to grow up. <p> Calling for Mother to remember her baby <p> Calling for Mother, the heartaches to mend. <p> Amid silent darkness stream the tears of the Mother -- <p> Birthed of the good-byes of those she has borne, <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Calling for Fortune to please turn the time back <p> Calling for Peace in her heart so forlorn. <p> Article copyright Lamaze International, Inc. <p> Article copyright Lamaze International, Inc. <p>
