1016841 Dakota 1866-67 <p> One of the boys tending the loose cattle with a freighter that came through Zimmerman in mid-December was telling the pair of idlers warming their feet in the livery barn that if it was work they wanted, Big John Knudsen was hiring down at Quail Lake. Leo was helping old Voight bring in a load of last year 's prairie hay, and overheard. <p> " He 's got hisself a big bunch of horses, " said the boy a little red-haired Irish kid. " Homely buggers, I 'll tell you. He 's feeding ' em potatoes out there on the ice. " <p> To get these nags to auction, said the kid, Knudsen wanted hands. The loungers looked the other way, but Leo figured this might be his chance. <p> Back at the cabin he started getting his stuff together, remembering how his brother had done the same four years earlier. The prospect of leaving home scared him some, but he had taken about all he could from Pa. Things just kept getting worse. The old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Half of it was natural craziness, the other half whiskey. He 'd call Leo down at every turn, and there were times he 'd scoot out of a dark corner and for no reason kick him in the ass. The only explanation he ever gave for doing anything crazy was " general principles. " <p> For the last three or four years, since he was about eleven, the bigger Leo grew the more the old man loathed him, as if he could n't stand his kid passing him up -- getting taller, wider, better looking and smart enough to read and write anything he wanted to. <p> It was Ma 's dying, Leo figured, that gave the start to these ugly ways, the old man muttering : " Yeah, you pestered her to death, but you ai n't gon na do it to me. " What? thought Leo. I was only seven, did I pester her that much? <p> The last straw was n't anything as grievous as getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucket of oats, which happened at Thanksgiving, but something simpler : the old man would n't let him have the wolfhound pup that old Voight offered him free -- although he himself owned a pair of gaunt, long-legged killers. He gave the familiar glare down his big beaked nose. " No sirree, not in my house. You 're too goddamned lazy to take care of it -- " when all along it was Leo who fed and brushed and ran the mean brutes that the old man bragged on and bet on whenever there was a wolf chase and he had fifty cents in his pocket. <p> The day the pup was nixed Leo worked out a plan to shoot the old man from ambush on the trapline. He knew the perfect spot : on a rocky incline where Pa would come around the comer of the trail and stare straight into the muzzle of his own rifle ; and just before the bullet, see clearly his son 's tearful face. <p> He 'd thought about it on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news got him thinking along other lines. Big John Knudsen -- Big Yawn, people called him -- was a familiar name thereabouts, last heard of two summers before when he 'd gone bust on two sections just south of the line into Dakota, near Buford. What the drouth did n't get of his wheat, people said, the cutworms got of his corn. He disappeared then, and people thought he 'd gone back east to the wife 's folks. But it looked like he had n't, if he was offering work down at Quail Lake. Where 'd he get them hosses? " one of the pair at the livery barn had asked the kid. " That 's what I 'd like to know. I bet the sheriff would too. " <p> They were wild range stock, said the boy, and some bought from the Indians. Or so it was said. <p> The man snickered and nudged his companion. " Honest John Knudsen, the horsetrader, " he said and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of year to take a long trip, but Leo was in luck. It did n't snow and the wind was no worse than usual. He kept Buster stepping briskly down the snow-caked freight road, to get there before dark. Nobody would come looking for him, he knew, but in a removed and unhappy way he wondered what would go through the old man 's mind when he realized he 'd seen the last of his kid. Not much, Leo reckoned ; he could n't remember the old man saying a word when his brother took off. <p> In the cold dusk as he came off the bluff and down into the lake basin, Leo saw that the kid on the bulltrain was right -- Knudsen indeed had himself a bunch of horses. They were massed everywhere in fie snow-covered landscape. Bands of a few dozen long-haired nags huddled here and there in the draws, and on the lee side of the small hills, where the snow was less deep. Some stood with heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frozen grass ; the dirty spots they had already worked over covered the hillsides like scabs. Several grubby men on horseback, who looked to have been recruited from the ice-cutters or the coots who trapped muskrats at the lake, plodded on the outskirts of the loose amimals, to keep them from scattering. The really ornery-looking broncs, Leo saw, were in makeshift wire and rope corrals along the road where it ran past the lake. <p> Leo pulled up Buster and looked over the sight. How in hell in the dead of winter could Knudsen at ford to feed all these critters? He had to be a richer man than anyone gave him credit for.... <p> Big John had set himself up a headquarters in a ten-by-ten sod hut at the south end of the lake. In person he belied his name, as Leo already knew, being a very medium-sized man. He wore eye-glasses off which glinted the light of his coal oil lantern, and he peered at Leo as if shrewdly judging him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his old man. <p> " Sure, " he said, " Old Dolf Beidermann, he was scmething. I remember one year he had the best catch of ermine I ever seen before or since. " That was back in the days when he traded in skins, and Leo could n't have been more than eight. <p> Yup, he told Leo, you got it right. He was indeed hi ring some good boys to take these fine animals out of Dakota over to the Iowa border, where, through privileged knowledge passed on by his Kansas City partners, he 'd been apprised of a prime market for quality horse flesh. Everybody was wanting good horses these days, Knudsen explained, did Leo know that? The army was buying, the freight companies were buying, the express lines were buying, and by God, even sight-seers from the east -- Englishmen from England, for example were buying up the best horses for their western tours and excursions. The goddamned nobility was coming out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses. How they gon na take their expensive tours without horses? They Were crying for horses back there. Just yesterday Knudsen had got a wired message from New York -- Ship more horses! It was, he trusted Leo would see, a cinch sellers ' market all the way. A blind man could make money! A man who did n't know a horse 's head from its ass could make money! Leo did n't know how lucky he was to get in on this extraordinary venture. <p> Having presented Leo with these facts, Knudsen drew a sober face. " By God, " he said.. " Do n't I wish I could make this trip with you boys? Nothing I like more than riding a good horse across that prairie. Buffalo, antelope, rabbit, chicken -- you can shoot enough meat in an hour to feed an army. " Four hundred miles of cold and snow and storms? Hell, he said, he could n't count the times he 'd done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was right today. <p> He shook his head sadly. " But I ai n't the man I was, and I admit it. Nope, them glory days is gone for Big John. Goddamn back give out on me, would n't you know? A man like myself, too. " <p> Well, there was one bright spot in all this -- the way his biggest boy Cobb had come along. A hell of a youngster. If anybody could fill Big John 's shoes when it came to horses, it was that fine lad, Cobb. Maybe Leo was acquainted with him, they were n't that far apart in years? Leo shook his head. <p> He 'd hired eight men, Knudsen announced. Leo would be number nine. And now that he was signing on -- he was, was n't he? -- they 'd leave at four o'clock tomorrow morning. The pay, Knudsen had to admit, was damned generous -- a dollar a day and plenty to eat. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cash money paid no later than the day following their delivery of the horses at Dakota City. <p> They shook hands on it, and Big John said Leo could sleep in the headquarters. Cobb would wake him in the morning. He took the lantern when he left, and in the cold dark on a bag of corn husks, Leo fell asleep full of misgivings. But still a touch of Big John 's enthusiasm, bogus though he knew it to be, had got to him ; and when a hand poked him awake in the black night, he was ready to go. <p> Saying no more than " We 're set, " Cobb stood by as Leo rolled up his gear. In the dark Leo tried to size him up. He was tall and thin, no more than a halfdozen years older than Leo, and from what he could see as they came out of the hut onto the snowy path, looked stooped and pale, as if he was n't any healthier than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that family, like beaked noses did in his. <p> Steadily they got underway. Big John collared Cobb where the old freight road came around the lake and pumped a loud stream of instructions at him. Cobb sat his horse silently, staring at the snow and nod. ling. Leo pulled Buster over a few yards to where two riders sat their horses, half-listening to Knudsen, waiting to get moving. <p> Leo said, " I guess you boys are in on this drive too. " <p> " I guess we are, " said one. He was an Indian boy not much older than Leo, who said he was called Chief. The other rider, a boy of about seventeen, leaned over to shake Leo 's mittened hand. He was a broad-shouldered fellow, his face hardly visible in the pulled-up hood. His name was Duwayne. He said he was from near Zimmerman, but Leo could n't remember seeing him before. <p> Having laid out the marching orders to Cobb, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you two boys to take up the back side here. Cobb 's gon na head ' em out. " He motioned Chief to follow him. and told them he 'd ride along for a mile or two, despite the misery in his back, and get them over the toughest spots. The muskratters were chasing band after band out of the ravines and off the hillsides, and others sprung the ropes and wires of the corrals. For half an hour a mass of brown and gray and earthcolored horseflesh surged around and past Leo and Duwayne, who pulled up their mounts and watched the horses merge into a herd, with Knudsen and Chief funneling them on, Leo supposed, to Cobb and the other riders hidden far ahead. As the last horses came dashing up, Leo and Duwayne fell in behind. In front of them, the horses slewed and vaulted for footing, plunging through drifts that obscured the road. Someone yelled " Wahoo! Yippee! Git along! " It was Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back, too ; one scruffy old geezer saluting Leo as Buster slugged past ; the only goodbye Leo had gotten so far. <p> A mist of sleet began to fall as the horizon lightened. It looked to Leo as if they were on a slab of tableland with nothing in their way for a day or two until the river breaks. Riding in the rear he was ten or twelve rods from Duwayne, but often they ranged close enough to talk. Chief was half way up the herd on the south flank, with Cobb and the others too far ahead to see. <p> The sleet, having wetted him and Buster enough to freeze, stopped. It grew fully light, cold and gray. The air snapped in Leo 's nostrils. The mass of horses was in a ragged string, a half-dozen animals wide ; he could n't see more than halfway up the line. With the light of day on them the animals nearest Leo revealed a shabbiness that bothered him. No doubt the pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his horse toward him across the trail of smashed and dirtied snow. " What d' ya think of these nags? " he called. " See any you 'd like to take home to the old lady? " <p> " I do n't know, " said Leo. " Knudsen said he was gon na sell ' em to Englishmen for their excursions. " <p> Duwayne hooted. " You bet! " he said. " Some swell in fancy britches is gon na slap his little pancake saddle on that? He pointed to a skinny, hammer-headed gray mare, her loose belly hanging, thick winter hair sticking at angles and scabbed with snow, and one chewed ear cocked wrong. She was n't much worse than her nearest companions. All of them seemed unusually small to Leo. <p> " It 's all wild range stock, bunch of two-bit nags, " Duwayne said. " They ai n't had nothing to eat, and their mommas and daddys was all bred wrong anyways. Hell, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't afford to feed ' em, so he has to ship ' em. Nobody who knows his business would do that in the middle of winter. " <p> Leo found that none of this came as a surprise. But yet he thought that surely there was some market for these culls. Knudsen was n't sending them off with only a hope and prayer : he could n't be fool enough to expect any horsetrader in the country to pay more than a nickel for these woeful goats. <p> " They 're killers, is my guess, " Duwayne said. " Going straight to the Ioway butchers and get made into some nice horse steaks for the foreigners. Plenty of ' em eat horse meat, you know -- Frenchmen, Chinamen. Hell, they 'd rather have that than deer or beef. " <p> Duwayne pulled his horse over to let a few stragglers get by and Leo appraised the truth in what he said. No good reason to doubt it. He 'd heard tales about Frenchmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. For sure, no one hereabouts would eat them. He had a vague notion that there was a law in the States about white men eating horse or dog meat, unless they were dying from starvation. Hell, then folks even ate their kids. But such a law would n't hold back a Frenchman. <p> Still, he wondered if the top-notch animals, all the trim express horses and big freight brutes were n't up front being coddled by the other riders, and because he and Duwayne were the youngest, they got the scrubs to tend. <p> By mid-day the herd was well caught In a pattern of moving forward. The animals in the rear had the easiest time, the snow having been trampled into the semblance of a rough trail. Leo 's pony followed on this threshed-over road, scattered with dung and yellow holes burnt all the way to the ground beneath. Both Leo and Duwayne kept busy shooing back broncs that drifted to the side, testing their chances for escape. Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> " We could use another hand or two back here, " he said. " A lot of these buggers keep wanting to go home. " <p> " Sure enough, " said Chief. The big collar of his coat was turned up, hugging his chin like wings. Outside it hung an elk 's eye-tooth on a string. A length of old towel was tied under his chin and over his ears. He agreed. " We sure ought a have more than just us. I think Cobb 's gon na hire some, if he can. I think his old man told him to. " <p> " Well, hell, " Leo said. " He told me he had nine guys. " <p> Chief looked at him to see if he was joking. " Nope, " he said, waving a mitten back toward Duwayne. " There 's just us. " <p> By the second day the herd was moving in fits and starts as the horses dropped back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spare his pony, Leo walked, tramping through hillocks of flailed snow dotted with horse apples. He marked anew the scruffiness of the ill-favored specimens just ahead. Some hardly came to his shoulder. They appeared to carry scant eating meat. He hoped to God Big John was n't working some slimy hoax and everybody would get cheated out of their wages. That morning he had asked Cobb if there was any doubt about selling the herd, and Cobb, who was a lot more nervous than a boss should be, jumped on him and told him to just drive the bastards and leave the financial angles to somebody else. <p> Besides being boss, it turned out that Cobb was also the cook -- at least he said he 'd do the cooking, but all that meant was he 'd get a fire going at nightfall and haul out beans, bacon and canned tomatoes from the sacks on the two pack horses he was trailing. Then he 'd tell Leo and the others to heat up what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper, gnawing the half-done bacon he 'd heated in the pan he 'd made by cutting the bottom inch off a three-pound lard can. At least they had plenty of coffee, and Leo made it as hot a s he could stand, for the warmth in it. <p> Even with the promised nine men, Leo saw, it would have been a short crew. He judged they had more like three-hundred head, not two-hundred, as Big John had said, spread out for a mile, with stragglers stretching it even further. Finding feed would take up a lot of time, Leo realized, and unless there was no snow up ahead, the heavy going could tack a few days onto their trip.... He calculated how his wages would add up, if they did n't bring the nags to market before the middle of February. <p> Nobody broached Cobb about the missing six hands. It was as if they should have known better anyway. They each had their job, Cobb and Duwayne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear. Trailing behind, they kept an eye out for likely mounts, since they hoped to spell their own ponies. Chief owned a lariat, with which he demonstrated a deft hand on a laggard horse, but they saw nothing they cared to ride. <p> This was the coldest country Leo had ever been in. A man might think he 'd seen colder, coming from the north border, but he had n't. Nights, trying to sleep, all the furtherest parts of him turned either numb or tingling, as if about to fall off. When he managed to doze, he 'd start up in alarm, feeling his toes like stone. For the first week he had only two old army blankets, but then he managed a lucky trade. At one noon stop, at a snowed-over creek crossing, he found a small canvas sack stuck in a hole under a fallen alder trunk ; it contained a nicked and bent razor, strop and a fragment of mirror. Someone had cached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be near worthless, but Leo thought that some people could find use for anything. He kept it, and was glad he did. Near Biscuit Creek they met two half-breeds -- brothers, they said -- traveling on mules to Bismarck ; and when Leo thought to offer his find for sale, they brought out a tattered old buffalo robe to trade. An unpleasant pair -- Leo feared that Cobb might offer them jobs, but Cobb had no such intention : he had his crew. What the brothers wanted with the shaving rig was a mystery, since neither looked to have touched his scraggly halfFrench beard in years ; but Leo was happy to get the robe. <p> The breeds also had a half-gallon of whiskey up for sale. No trade. Cash money only -- unless Chief wanted to part with that elk 's eye-tooth, eh? Chief was n't interested, nor was Leo, But as the hairy pair showed off their prize, Duwayne rode back. <p> " Hullo, what we got here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fur-trimmed hood to get a better look. He called the brothers to one side to bargain. <p> Leo shook out and admired his frayed robe, and wondered why the breeds had let it go for so little. The more he thought about it, he wondered if he had n't got the short end. Forgetting that the shaving gear was itself worthless, he vowed to keep a damned smart watch in any deals hereafter. <p> The rest of that day they followed the frozen river south toward Severance, the snow deepening in scalloped drifts along the bank. The wind-swept ice was easier going for the horses, although many stepped awkwardly from the snow balls packed into their hooves. In most places the ice was a yard thick, but there were stretches of rubber ice too, and a thin spot claimed a few ponies on the side of the herd away from Leo. He heard Duwayne yelling like a madman, but did n't see them go, or even the break in the ice. He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All week the wind had n't stopped once. It might cairn a little after dark, but whipped up again during the day. That afternoon it picked up suddenly. In ten minutes it was no longer a fierce, bucketing blast from the west, but had boiled into a murderous, screaming gale tearing out of the northwest full of snow -- horizontal streaks of snow, the wind too violent to let it fall. <p> Not long before Leo had been thinking that, cold though it was, they 'd been lucky with weather. Now he could n't see the horse 's ass in front of him, and he soon recognized that for all the wind and snow he had seen, here he was about to get the feel of them joined in a way to guarantee mankind 's misery. He pulled his hood tight, and kept a firm hand on Buster 's left rein, to keep him from swinging his tail square to the storm. <p> With all the weather, Cobb did n't wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river and onto a long plateau slanting off a ridge, which the wind had cleared enough for the animals to get at that frozen grass. <p> With Chief 's help, Leo found the only half-protected spot to be seen in the roiling snow. It was a litlle stand of stunted cedars, shoulder-high, but with gnarled branches making a partial low roof, under which they threw their bed rolls. Fifty feet away, hardly a shadow through the snow, Duwayne scooped a trench in the snow alongside a downed cot tonwood trunk, well out of the wind. <p> Leo was hacking the ice out of Buster 's hooves with his knife when Cobb emerged with their supper food. With difficulty they got a small fire started under the cedars and quickly ate. As Cobb and Dr wayne left to ride the first night shift -- Leo and Chief to take the second -- Cobb called back. <p> " Watch yourself, " he said. He had been distracted all the while they hunkered over the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of snow. " A guy can get lost in this stuff. " <p> Chief called after him, " I know that, boss. You tell them horses. " <p> Leo had hoped the buffalo robe would make the difference in a warm sleep, but it was a chilled onagain-off-again doze ; and when Duwayne came off his shift and kicked him and Chief in the boots, he was ready to jump around to get his blood moving. The snow had n't let up a bit. <p> " Where are the horses? " he asked Duwayne. He could n't see a yard in any direction, and he marvelled that Duwayne had managed to find them.... Unless he had n't bothered to leave his snow ditch by the cottonwood. <p> " Out there somewheres, by God, " Duwayne laughed. " I doubt a man could miss the bastards. Jes ' follow their turds. " He disappeared into the snowy blackness. <p> " Where 's the lantern? " Leo called after him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have kept it, " said Chief. He had a blanket wrapped around him, back to the wind. " He 's ' fraid of the dark. " <p> On their ponies, they moved in search of the herd. The wind descended In furious swirls, seeming to throw a woolly skirt of snow around them wherever they moved, as if they were the eye of the storm. Cautiously and together they moved toward where the herd might be, and when Buster floundered into a dark flank that leaped away, they decided they had found it. With Chief 's lariat joining their two saddles at twenty feet, they rode back and forth along a thirty rod line. As far as Leo could tell no horses tried to get past. <p> The cold stung him everywhere. He removed a mitten to tuck a bare hand under his coat and into his armpit and could n't tell if that warmed his fingers or froze his armpit. His feet were lumps ; trying to jiggle them he set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with snow, the pony seemed not to notice. When they passed on the turn, taking care not to tangle the lariat, Leo saw that Chief looked to have set up housekeeping in his saddle, the blanket wrapped around his shoulders falling away like a tent. <p> They kept at this until the snow seemed to fall more brightly in one direction, a tracery of faint light in the east as day began. Out of this rode Cobb on his big mare that could plow through drifts where his Buster would valiantly flounder. He said he 'd spent the entire night keeping the herd from being blown away, had n't slept a goddamned wink. To the side of him, coming visible in the light through the falling snow, was a long semi-circle of humped shapes, snow-covered horses like a moon-scape of boulders. <p> They had to move out quick, Cobb said. They had to hope there was some browse among the breaks ahead. " Some of these critters look weak enough to drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had n't noticed before, a week ago. Just in the minute he sat talking snow had plastered over the wolf-fur trim on his hood <p> Leo nodded, that 's right. He could n't think about not trusting Cobb. Cobb sounded as if he knew where they were, and as the light grew through the snow, east was where it was supposed to be, and Cobb indeed had them pointed in the right direction. They were ready to pull out, except for Duwayne. <p> " I 'll get him, " said Leo. He turned Buster toward the cottonwood trunk, riding along what remained of the track he and Chief had made during the night and veering into the drifts to the snow-covered lump where a few broken branches stuck through. <p> Duwayne had enlarged his trench into a small cave, Leo saw, with the overhang of the trunk as a roof, and in this hole lay Duwayne, although no part of him could be seen but his fur hat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Leo hesitated. This did n't look right. " Ho, Duwayne, " he called, leaning from his pony to peer into t he hole. " We 're moving out. Old Cobb is waiting on you. " He cocked his ear, as if he expected any reply would come from a distance. <p> Nothing for a moment, and then the mound trembled, the blankets beneath it heaved, dislodging the snow, and a guttural noise issued from under. In a ponderous move, Duwayne turned on his side and tried to prop himself on one elbow. Failing that, his head slowly came around, fur hat covering his face to the bridge of his nose and his coat collar turned up over chin and cheeks. Out of this poked his heavy nose, tipped white. His legs kicked against the blankets to send more snow flying ; then abandoning any attempt to rise, he was quiet. Leo swung off his Pony and bent into the cave. Duwayne opened his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " he whispered. <p> Half-covered with snow, the empty jar lay at Duwayne 's side. Leo kicked it away. " You dumb asshole, " he said, and picked up the top blanket, which lay loose and untucked, and shook the snow out of it. It smelled of piss. Under this, Duwayne was rolled in another, from which his boots stuck out, frozen over with snow, and his pants legs stiff and shiny with Leo did n't want to think what the feet in those boots looked like. Near Duwayne 's head, the falling snow slowly covered a long brown stain of vomit, and over it Duwayne waved a mittened hand, to send Leo away. In the freezing air the smell of alcohol had a snap to it that Leo remembered from following his old man on his winter trapline. <p> " Can you stand up? Can you walk? " Leo said, but he could see slim prospect of either. " Where 's your horse? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in misery, and he mumbled, his lips bubbling. <p> " Jesus Christ, Duwayne! " Leo could hardly restrain himself from kicking the bundled figure. " Get up! " <p> For a moment he stood looking down at the stupefied face, the blistering cheeks, the white-tipped nose, on which the snow melted as it fell. This guy was nearly a grown man, older than Leo by three or so years, a lot further along the road. If this is where the wisdom come of his experience took him, God help the sorry lot of us, thought Leo. None of it made a picture that he saw himself in except at the blurred edge, where the artist had gotten careless. He could hear himself saying in his head, to hell with you, Duwayne, which he would n't say aloud : but it echoed in there. <p> He leaned down and tucked the snow-stiff blanket under Duwayne 's shoulder. " I 'm gon na get Cobb, " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk ass outta here. " <p> Cobb would n't leave the herd, or whatever part of it he had found. He was frantic that they 'd never get out of this storm in decent shape -- in any shape and already he had lost no telling how many : enough for his old man to skin him alive. Dis-tractedly he listened to about half of Leo 's story and then yelled, " The son of a bitch 'll have to catch us, that 's all! Let him find his damn horse! " His shrill voice popped out of the oval into which his hood was drawn, just space for his eyes and nose. Chief, listening beside him, wheeled his pony toward the herd, and disappeared. <p> " Goddamn it, if he 's drunk, he ai n't gon na get paid for today, either " <p> This last Cobb yelled over his shoulder as he turned his mare to follow the rumps of the rear-most broncs. <p> " Wait a minute, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him? " <p> There was no answer from Cobb ; but Chief reappeared out of the snow and he was towing a thin, high-legged horse, a gelding with a little size over the others, who bore signs of a harness and did n't fight the hackamore Chief had thrown on him. <p> " Okay, then, " said Chief, " let 's go get the son of a bitch. " <p> He was scarcely conscious. The two of them hauled him groaning out of the snow. " Come on, Whiskey Kid, " said Chief, yanking Duwayne up by one arm as if he had done this before. " You can handle this bronc. " <p> But Duwayne was in no shape to ride bareback ; he flopped like a fish from one side to the other. Roughly, Leo and Chief slid him onto his stomach, doubled him over the animal 's back, and when the horse shied from that curious burden, they threw him on:o dependable Buster. Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buster 's belly. Leo swung onto the surprised third horse and they set off to catch up with the herd. <p> Snubbed across Leo 's saddle, Duwayne, racked by convulsions, began to retch. Behind him, Leo was at first concerned and then disgusted. He could see Cobb 's point of view in the matter of Duwayne. <p> The herd was n't always in sight through the snow but its trail was plain. Some of Big John 's nags might have gone through the ice or strolled off into the storm, but a sufficient number remained to leave a wide and filthy track, even as the falling snow tried to clean it up. <p> With Chief 's lariat connecting the wild horse to Buster, Leo followed, uncomfortably bareback. Before long they stopped, and managed to get the moaning Duwayne wedged into the saddle, slumped forward over Buster 's neck. The wet collar of his coat had frozen to his cheeks, and while Leo gently pried the cloth free of the flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waist and the saddlehorn. <p> " Do n't you pass out no more, " Chief said. " Less you wan na fall and get your head stepped on. " <p> " He must be froze down to his ass, " Leo said. <p> " If he 's cold, he better say so, " said Chief, knocking the gouts of snow off his sleeves and pants and remounting. " He sure smells like shit, do n't ya, Mr. Whiskey Kid? " <p> Leo ached with the cold, the moreso as he looked on Duwayne 's misery. <p> " You think that was poisoned whiskey? " he asked. <p> " Forty-rod whiskey, " said Chief. " You bet. " <p> The herd was again losing itself in the wall of falling snow. Again, they plunged after it. <p> Mid-afternoon they saw Cobb again. The snow had picked up -- where in the hell was it all coming fro : n? -- and the wind came in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't acquainted with. It all seemed to come out of some higher country, from farther north than before. <p> Cobb was a little calmer than earlier. " I got ' em settled down up ahead, " he said. " There 's a little open spring and some bare ground. It 's all salt or something, but they put their noses right into it. No sense trying to push ' em any more. " <p> While he was talking he looked at Duwayne, hunched insensibly over Buster 's neck, but said nothing to him, and after handing Leo the food-sack, he rode back " to keep tabs on the leaders " as he put it-which were horses, Leo realized, he had never set eyes on and he wondered what they looked like. <p> " Hey, Whiskey Kid, you still alive? " said Chief. He untied Duwayne, slid him off Buster and held him upright while Leo kicked away and stamped down the snow in a wedge-shaped cavity of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind. " You like to have a whiskey drink now, how about it? " <p> Duwayne moaned as they lowered him into his rocky corner. " Sons a bitches, hunh, hunh.... " <p> Wind whisked the snow around to sting like nettles. Chief threw Duwayne his blanket roll and went with Leo to twist off sage branches, enough to get a fire burning at Duwayne 's feet, the rock a little higher than their heads making a good heat reflector. Nearby, Chief stumbled over a large cottonwood branch, and with his horse and rope, dragged it in. <p> " That 's good for all night, " said Chief, kicking the slabs of snow off it. " If we can get her started. " <p> From the food sack Leo pulled a sheet of dried deer meat and biscuits, an end of salt pork and a can of tomatoes, and set the lot up ready to cook, once the fire whose wind-blown flame darted everywhich-way, got itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coffee under a corner of Duwayne 's blanket to keep it dry until he had some water boiling. <p> Duwayne, it appeared, had passed out again. Leo nudged the drunken boy 's snow-caked boots and legs closer to the fire, but wondered whether that was right. If he was half as frozen as he looked, he was going to smart something awful when the thaw started. <p> Just as Leo was about to untie his bedroll from his saddle, Cobb dashed up. He 'd gone back to his panic of the morning. His big mare threw up snow with her flexed forelegs as Cobb wheeled her before the fire. <p> " Get on your horses! " he yelled. " The bastards took off again! " He sounded like an old woman yelling at her hogs and he was pulling his poor mare all wrong : she turned three times before he got her facing them. <p> " Jesus, " said Chief to Leo, " I never seen a guy get so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and headed out as if he knew what needed to be done, or was hurrying to repair whatever damage Cobb had already done. <p> " We 'll head ' em off! " yelled Cobb. " Hey, you, Duwayne! You ai n't drawing wages to sit around no god damned fire! " <p> Duwayne made no response. <p> " They headed south, the whole goddamn bunch! " Cobb yelled pointing. Leo looked to where he pointed and thought, well that could be south : how, was a man to know in this shitty storm? <p> " We gon na head ' em off, " said Cobb. " ' C'm on, you follow me. " He pulled his mare around into the obscuring snow. <p> Leo set his pony to follow. The fire had halfwarmed him and now his cheeks burned again with the old. In his hand he still held the food sack from which he had been taking grub for their supper -- no sup per for anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his oilcloth saddle pouch. If Duwayne was up to supper, he 'd have to make his own. <p> The wind varied its wicked speed depending upon the wrinkles in the ridge. It would at times swing into him like a cyclone, straight into his face, and neither Leo nor Buster fancied poking a nose into it ; but there was no sure way to turn to keep it at their backs. It stung to breathe. Leo kept to the threshed-up snow that was the track of Cobb 's mare -- lost it for a minute, found it again. Then the win d quartered steadily on him, not gusts but a relent less one-way shove. With that, the snow changed too, becoming finer, needle-like, shooting along the win d like splintered shotgun pellets. Even with one miten an inch from his eyes, snow flicked stingingly into them. For all Leo hauled on the reins, Buster turned tail, and when Leo managed to saw his head around, the pony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and together he and Buster lunged back to better footing, better because the. snow came only to their knees. <p> If he had managed to stay anywhere near Cobb or the herd, nothing showed it now. Leo realized he could face any one of the four directions -- and here there might be five or more -- and it would all be the same ; he 'd see nothing but snow, if he could open his. eyes into it. <p> Having no fix on which way to point, he gave Buster the bit.... <p> A smart horse, Leo told himself, could smell its ways a clever animal that knew how to survive as well as a coyote. It took smartness to weather violent winters on the open range, one storm after another, and in April come trotting out with a four-foot tail and shedding hair in all directions, but still alive and full of beans. He 'd seen them. Horses were smart, people did n't think so, but they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too. Hunkered forward in the saddle over the pony 's snow-clotted mane, Leo thought he must look like Duwayne, back there a ways with a big fire. Suddenly Duwayne was the lucky one.... <p> The worst story he knew about men lost in storms was one his mother told about her father, when they lived up on the border. He 'd heard the story more than once, every winter when it stormed badly. Her father had a team of fine Percherons -- " he would n't take five hundred dollars cash for them, " she said-brought over as colts from France, and the story behind that was never revealed or else Leo did n't remember. A heavy norther blew in one day just after Christmas. The two horses were out in a field the old man had fenced off with brush and brambles. A couple of milk cows were out there too. When the storm hit, neither horses nor cows came for shelter in the sod barn, which they had always done before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set out into the thick of it, unable to see a foot ahead. Leo 's mother was ten. With her older sister and mother, she waited all night, dozing now and then, feeding the fire with cobs and hay twists. They told themselves that it was impossible for Pa to get lost, since he could simply follow the fence line around to the barn, where he probably was, warm and comfortable with the stock. But he did n't come in the next morning, nor had he returned by nightfall. All the while the storm howled unceasingly. Ma 's mother was crazy with worry. When on the second morning the storm at last slacked off and she waded frantically into the snow, no more than five rods from the barn she found her husband doubled over the fence, his head and shoulders buried in a drift on one side, and his feet and knees in a drift on the other, and only the seat of his brown canvas pants to show where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The oats had been eaten and it was full of snow. The big horses stamped hungrily by the barn, one forlorn cow beside them, the other under a distant drift, the carcass not to be found for days. Every time he heard the story Leo wondered if the horses had eaten the oats before or after his grandfather froze. <p> He could see no reason for it, but his pony seemed suddenly to step out with new purpose. Leo felt a moment of hope although there was nothing to support it. Indeed, it seemed gloomier around him, dirty gray beyond the swirling snow. It could be nightfall coming on, he thought, or some darker dimension of the storm working itself up. <p> The bandanna over his nose and mouth had turned into a sheet of ice which he cracked away. Gouts of snow plastered into the creases where his coat collar met his cheeks and he brushed them away before they froze. There were times he could n't see Buster 's ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or did n't see, out in the storm looking for his team. <p> No question, it was growing dark, and he almost felt like crying. He spoke quickly to Buster : " Okay, this is what we 're gon na do -- " <p> It is n't as if he had n't camped in snow before, although never anything like this. He 'd been out with his old man on the trapline plenty of times.... But Jesus Christ, this was n't what he signed on for! <p> Now he saw why Buster had perked up. The pony had headed into different country, taking a long angle down a draw, to get himself out of the brunt of the wind, and onto a lower slope where brush tops protruded from the shallower snow. They struck Let 's boots as Buster waded through. Here he could see a few feet around him and the wind was not so fierce. But how far he had strayed from the track of the herd to get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was in a stand of willows and an alder or two, their tops a foot above the snow -- browse for the, pony. Without dismounting, Leo kicked the snow oft the top branches to see what he had. They might furnish a wall for a camp, if he dug down along the slender trunks. " Well, you gon na have something to eat anyway, " he said to Buster. <p> With his pony tied in reach of a good supply of willow, Leo began to dig away the snow within a srr all semi-circle of trunks, holding his mittens together as a scoop, until he cleared a space long enough to lie down in and wide enough to turn around. The thin trunks and branches with the snow packed between them made walls on three sides. There was no wind here, but no lack of snow. He thought of Duwayne in his rock niche and wondered who was better off. For a camp, he reckoned rock was better than willow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day, although he could hear the wind tearing at the ridge high above, another world now ; he was glad to be out of. He could hear Buster heave through the snow to get at more willow. The falling snow seemed to absorb the dusk, taking on an odd, distant light, as if each flake for just a moment picked up the last of the daylight. <p> With dark it grew immensely cold. Leo knew there had to be more wood here than green willow. He was in a draw at the bottom of which a creek doubtless flowed In summer, and on it would float odds and ends of wood. A yard or two outside his camp, on the downward slope, Leo kicked and pawed into the snow until he came to the ice of small frozen pools, into which was embedded a variety of drifted pieces of pine, cedar and cottonwood the size of his arm. These he kicked free, his feet unfeeling ; and hauling them up the slope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him. <p> With a handful of dead leaves dried in his hand inside his mitten -- his old man had done that once with oak leaves -- he brought a small flame to life. The sight of it buoyed him beyond measure, and he crouched over it to keep the snow off. Out of his saddle-pouch he dug the food sack, not knowing what he 'd find -- whatever Cobb had handed him that he had n't passed on to Duwayne before being hauled away in Cobb 's panic. It held a large twist of flour, a hand-sized slab of bacon and two cans of tomatoes.... No coffee. <p> He had slid his pony 's blanket from under the saddle and in this rolled his blankets and the buffalo robe to keep the snow out of them, and this made a couch for him by the tiny fire. The momentary comfort of it called into mind his immediate prospects : the dread hours of the night. No better in the long range : he 'd lose his job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even if he did find Cobb, he 'd be fired for not keeping up with the horses. Nobody paid you for getting lost, even if it was in a storm, Damn! And it was n't even nearly his fault. <p> In his cup he melted snow, lamenting the lack of coffee, and into it mixed enough flour to make a batter. This he fried in his lard-can pan, after the slab of bacon he had first sliced into it gave up its fat, snow flakes sizzling as they hit the hot grease. The batter bubbled up into the drippings and hardened. He let the dough soak up the grease, then wrapped the halfcooked bacon in it. He now had what the old man had called grust, and when Leo asked him why, he said because that was the way it looked, did n't it? It warmed his insides, but, Goddamn, would n't coffee go over good now? <p> In the dash of flames he caught a glimpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if hoping to come in. The snow had given him the beginning of a dunce cap. <p> " G'wan, eat some more, " Leo told him. " You ai n't coming in here, that 's for sure. " Talking bolstered him : he tried to keep it up. " G'wan, get yourself a bellyful of those leaves. You 're gon na need it. You got ta haul us outta here tomorrow. You 're a lucky hoss, all right, all this good stuff to eat. " Leo could have told him stories he 'd heard about starving ponies eating tarpaper off the roof of a shack, and others nibbling on sheeps ' wool. <p> Soon he laid out his saddle blanket and on that his bed roll. The wood he pushed up to the fire would keep it alive for a couple of hours. He slapped as much snow as he could off his boots, pants and coat and, before he was plastered anew, rolled himself into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fire. They would n't stay warm for long, but he remembered what his Pa often said : like the lady says, every little bit helps. <p> He slept some, for short stretches, but kept coming awake unable to feel his toes and wriggling them until he could. His breath had moistened the robe covering his head ; it was frozen stiff and smelled of horse-piss. When he did sleep he heard Duwayne 's groat muffled by snow, and he awakened thinking that if they had stayed together they 'd both be better off. But then he thought, hell, he did n't know but what Chief and Cobb had nailed down the herd and come back to build a nice camp by Duwayne 's rock, and they were all chuckling around a nice fire, drinking coffee, and Leo was the only one who did n't know where ; he was.... <p> When he reluctantly pulled the robe off his head at dawn, he saw above him a flat slate sky. No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but blessedly it no longer fell. <p> Moisture froze on his cheeks, and he staggered up or feet like stones, blanket hung over his shoulders, and steamily relieved himself. He buttoned up hastily as the cold hit his damp groin. Buster, coated with snow, icicles hanging from his lip, watched sorrowfully. <p> Uncovering the bits of firewood he had saved, he lighted a tiny fire and stood over it pinching his nose until he could feel it. It was no use trying to punch open a can of frozen tomatoes, so he thawed a thumb of bacon and melted a cupful of snow for a drink. The idea of coffee sat large in his mind as he sipped the warm water, scarcely better than nothing. But along with the bacon it set him up sufficiently to see some small chance in the day ahead -- if there were no more storms. <p> In a few minutes he was on Buster, heading out as the fire sent up its last tendrils of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day grew clear, but with a keen wind that sent the loose snow sharply into Leo 's face. But it was rot so bad that he could n't see the land ahead. <p> By early fore-noon he had climbed out of the creek bottom and was high above and beyond his night 's camp. When he stopped to look back across the strings of blowing snow rapidly building drifts in every declivity, he wondered whether he 'd gotten turned around and was heading back the way he 'd come, toward where they had left Duwayne. It might be the best way to go, he thought. But as he turned Buster this way and that he saw the slope he was on could only take him east. Another ridge loomed In that direction and he bet himself that on the top of it he 'd see the herd 's trail, a big messy road in the snow.... <p> That 's another bet I lost, he said to himself, when there was nothing to see from that vantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills, with snow-filled draws between, except to the west, far behind him, where he could make out the shadowed peaks of the Sourmilk Mountains. <p> Nothing looked right in all this snow. In his head he knew how this country was supposed to look, and it did n't look that way. Cobb was meant to be headed onto flat land, plains, a gentle slope a man could coast down all the way to Illinois, not anywhere close to these hog-backs and cliffs and ravines and shoulderbone ridges. This was no landscape where you would expect to see men, Leo thought. One man sure did n't amount to anything here -- or ten, or a hundred. <p> By mid-afternoon he faced the cheerless prospect of another night 's snow-camp. He kept Buster headed up, figuring the higher he got, the more he 'd see, but up here there was no hiding from the wind, and no hope of a fair spot to camp. <p> Here he was about as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look around, once noting that he had come in sight of a dark fold running evenly upon an opposite slope. It ran, he judged, east to west, either end obscured by the fog of blowing snow. It had the look of a real trail, perhaps only an animal track, but if antelopes or buffalo used it, so could folks like him. <p> As he pondered the difficulty of plowing his way to it, he was startled to see a dark figure emerge from the white mist of snow to the east. He could hardly restrain himself from yelling, but then realized he might only be hollering at an old bull buffalo, or one of the horses spun off Cobb 's herd. But in another minute a second figure took on shape behind the first, and soon several more followed. <p> These were men on horses. Leo whooped and waved ; the first figure stopped, then the others stopped too. In a few moments they found him, and waved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as did his own. <p> " Hulllooo, " he kept hollering half the way down. <p> They were soldiers, a detachment out of Fort Snelling to Fort Eden, carrying medicine, mail and military messages -- " the three D 's, " said their leader. He pushed back his hood to talk to Leo. He was a man of about forty with a big mustache, mounted on a leggy black mare. He said he was Corporal Doggit. On mules behind him were four men about which Leo could tell nothing. They were trussed up in heavy coats or blankets, making huge lumps atop their animals, with no bare skin showing but for the blowhole at their mouths. Following them, were a halfdozen pack mules. Men and animals alike blew out clouds of steam as they drew toward the breathless Leo. <p> " What the hell you doing here, boy? " the corpora said when he got a closer look at Leo. " Where you coming from anyways? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leo, although to this stern non-com he was ready to go further back, to why he 'd left home to keep from shooting the old man. " Got caught in that storm, " he said, and he described the horses they 'd been driving and how he got separated -- he never said " 1ost " -- from them. They were headed, he said, for Dakota City --. <p> " Dakota City? " one of the men hooted in a high voice from out of the ratty fur around his pulled-up hood. " You got yourself a good ways to go then. " <p> Not a sign had they seen of horses, Cobb or Chief. Leo opened his mouth to ask if they 'd come across Duwayne, but quickly stopped : how could they have? They were coming from the opposite direction. But he wanted to tell them about Duwayne, who seemed a more important reason for his being out here alone than getting separated from the herd. <p> The corporal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know, " he said, " there 's lots easier ways to get to where you 're going than the way you come. " <p> " I do n't doubt it for a minute, " said Leo. " But how, we come was n't up to me. The boss laid it out. " <p> " What outfit 's that? " asked the corporal. <p> " Fellow name of Big John Knudsen. " <p> " Hoo-boy, shit, " said the corporal with a great cloud of steam. " I know Knudsen. That son of a bitch ha. t a contract with us a couple of years ago for Indian beef. Fast talker, ai n't he? Little-bitty eye spectacles. Sure. Did n't deliver worth shit. Come down to where the major would n't take his paper. I heard he left the country. " <p> " Well, I would n't know. He could of, " said Leo. " I think he bought those horses in Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his boy. " <p> " Bought ' em, did he? You bet, " said Corporal Doggit. " Big John Knudsen never spent a nickel unless he 'd calculated how to swindle you out of it afterwards. Boy, you ever heard the saying there 's no honest man in a horse trade '? Hell, even the major come close to getting his ass handed to him by Big John, and he 's no fool. " <p> " I would n't know about that, " said Leo sadly. Now he was certain that he 'd never see his wages. Somehow he was n't surprised that these men, come upon by chance in the middle of a rolling prairie empty of all but snow, knew more about his business than he did. <p> No one had dismounted, the snow being too deep. The animals had gradually worked their rears around to meet the sharp breeze, and the men sat enclosed in their wrapping, making no unnecessary movements, except one fellow with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were soldiers except the U.S. brands on their mounts. <p> The corporal pulled his mare around, but before he could leave, Leo said, " Can I ask you a question? Say I was to head out from here to Dakota City, how long you think it 'd take? " He knew even as he asked that if the answer was more than ten minutes, he would n't heed it. <p> " Four days, " the corporal said. " Your best bet is to go straight to Pipestone, then you got a good track south on the old freight road. " <p> Leo had never heard of Pipestone. He said, " Well, then, how long 'll it take you boys to reach your Fort? " He wondered if their trail would take them near Duwayne 's camp. <p> " Be there tomorrow night easy, if it do n't snow and I do n't believe it will. Boy, you 'd be better off by a long shot coming with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further persuading. <p> " You 'd drag your ass all the way to Dakota City and probably never see Knudsen anyways. If the boy is anything like the old man and I believe he is. You know the saying a chip off the old block '? " Doggit snorted. " Hell, he ai n't got no horses left anyways. After that storm, and you say he only got two hands to drive'em? Hell, half of ' em is in Canada, the other half is in Missouri. " <p> Leo wondered if he should make a correction. Only one hand, good old Chief. But he could n't explain now. Instead, he said, " I 'd be much obliged if I could tag along with you boys, then. " <p> The corporal waved an okay, pulled his animal around, and the others followed, moving briskly west. Leo fell in behind the caboose mule, a weary Buster at last with a well-broken trail. After an hour or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last soldier, coughing steadily trader his blanket, who he saw row was not much older than himself. <p> " I was wondering, " said Leo, " What 's the chances of a fellow getting some work at the Fort? " <p> " You mean not in the army? I could n't tell you. Hell, join up. You like living in silk and satin and eating oysters, do n't you? " This set him to coughing, and when he had recovered he went on. " Maybe you could get some cowboy work. You know, Major Brickley does the contracts for Indian beef, and these drovers bring in their cattle and they got ta hold ' em until the Indians come in to shoot ' em. Couple of days, sometimes, so the contractor, he hires somebody to cowboy that herd. They got better work to do. They pay good, though, dollar a day. " <p> " Well, hell, " said Leo. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pony fall back, and he considered his chances. His job had got up and run away from him, but it looked as if he might land on his feet after all. <p> Under leaden skies the soldiers with Leo following worked their way along the slope, snow squeaking under the animals ' hooves. <p> Leo took up a careful watch of the northern slope opposite. He had firmly in mind what he would do if he spied the slightest mark of yesterday 's trail, the one that led to his willow camp ; or if he saw evidence -- any hint at all -- of the track he and Chief had made following Cobb and the herd -- if he saw any of these signs, then he could trace his way back to Duwayne 's camp. <p> To himself he laid out what he would do when that happened. He would ride ahead to Corporal Doggit and announce that there was something Leo would appreciate him and his boys ' help in doing, and that was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where there was a big cottonwood branch might still be burning... where there was this old boy name of Duwayne, who got himself left behind in that storm two days ago, and probably was n't in the best of shape... maybe could use some help.... <p> But in that broad and snowy landscape there was nothing he recognized, and he followed the mules in cold silence. <p> <p> By Lloyd Zimpel <p>
