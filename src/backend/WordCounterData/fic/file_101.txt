1015441 I : Hy Briske. " There is no creep on the face of the earth like Hy Briske. " This is what Dolly Rubell said of me, her prosecutor, weeks before she was executed with her husband, Solly Rubell, for espionage. She said it several times. I have it on tapes of her grousing in her cell. She also said it while fucking Solly -- this too a tape of yesteryear for nostalgia buffs, when the Rubells were still living in their little East Side hovel. Do I hold a grudge? Absolutely not. This is the purpose of the First Amendment. And she wo n't say it again. Solly on the stand. Solly in his shiny suit. A candystore boy. Yeshiva bocher Solly. Holding a tiny American flag and a Daily Worker, which he 'd been studying, underlining nourishing information with a red pencil. The sweat poured down Solly. Pools of it flooded his eyes and mouth. I asked him if he had told Dolly 's brother, Hershie, that the Soviet Union had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger as he talked about the first land of socialism. " You see, " sad Solly said, " I believed the Soviet Union was bearing the brunt of the war against Nazism. And I explained how the Soviet Union had improved the lot of the underdog, ended illiteracy and most death as we know it. " Solly beamed, his finger up. Carried away, he was beginning to think he could convince us. Even an idiot could understand it. " Would you like to overthrow the American way of life? " I asked him. " I heartily approve of our system of government, its constitution and Bill of Rights. Oh no, Mr. Briske, I just believe in live and let live and allowing The People to think for themselves and make up their own mind. I believe in The People. I know they will reach the correct conclusion if their minds are not clouded with irrelevant information. " " Mr. Rubell, were you a member of the Young Communist League @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer that question on the ground it might tend to incriminate me. " Judge Goldman addressed the jury : " You are to draw no inference whatsoever from the witness 's refusal to answer on his assertion of privilege. " " Huh! Course not! " I shouted. On the lunch break, I sat at my table at Lindy 's devouring a hot pastrami. The phone lit up. " I 'm in a tough spot, " Judge Goldman said. " All this publicity, this spotlight. It should be just me, my God, and I. You know? Instead I 'm the center of the universe. Hy, I need time to ponder away from the glare of publicity. I want peace, calm, breezes, water, goyishe refinement, and good food. I 'm thinking of the Concord for the weekend. What do you think? About sentences, I mean? " I thought of Solly, probably eating his egg sandwich on white bread in his cell at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tune : FORMATTED TEXT It was " The Song of the Red Air Fleet. " For a moment Solly would relax, wave his sandwich in the air. A smile would appear on his face ; his eyes would be closed. And he 'd have his favorite daydream : Solly at the window, suddenly tearless, sighting the star, and then the roar of the propeller, hovering overhead. Solly stepping through the window helped aloft by outstretched Soviet arms, and away he would go. And then Solly would open his eyes. Some people have doubted my sensitivity. Judge for yourself. Dolly followed Solly on the stand. She was no more a social bug there than anywhere else. I circled around the one witness the Rubells could muster, the little lady wearing sneakers, brown ankle socks, a red cap, and a button on her khaki jacket that said, " Shoot First! -- Manya Poffnick. " What is your profession, Mrs. Poffnick? " I asked her. " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am also a cafeteria worker. " " And what, Mrs. Poffnick, can you tell us of the Rubells? " " I know the Rubells as good progressive people they would never hurt a soul. I saw them selling subscriptions for the Daily Worker hours before they were arrested. That 's what kind of hot and heavy spies they were. " " Could you tell us about the espionage activities of Solomon and Dolores Rubell? " " Dolly Rubell would give her last dime to a person in need. Solly too. They were ordinary working people who wanted to help the workers. That 's the only crime they were guilty of. " " Mrs. Poffnick, " I said, " according to the Daily Worker, you are a widow. " " I was married in 1929 and he died in 1932. Peculiarly enough, his name was also Poffnick. He was a dressmaker. A very nice human being. " " And you have one living son? " I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " You have no children? But, Mrs. Poffnick, according to the Daily Worker on June 5, 1951, you spoke at an anti-war rally at Randalls Stadium and you said, quote : ' I had two sons. One was in the Second World War, and was killed. And you want me to lose the second one in Korea? Like hell! I do n't want my son or anyone else 's to be lost in Korea. For whom? For what? We have no business there. Before this war, I never even heard of Korea, for shit 's sake. ' Unquote. Did you make that statement? " " Sure, " Manya Poffnick said. " It 's the truth. We have no business in Korea. " " But you have no sons. " " What the hell 's wrong with that? I told a little lie. " Manya Poffnick was excused. Hershie Stern, Dolly 's brother, burped and belched his way to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a smiling joviality. I liked Hershie. He was real people. " Solly said the Russians were bearing the brunt of the war and we had to help them, " Hershie said. " Dolly backed him up. So I went with it. It was okay. I mean, it was shit, but I was twenty-three, right? " Then, " Hershie said, " Solly gave me $5,000 to get out of the country. I took it but I ai n't going nowhere. When Solly left, I turned to my wife and I guffawed. We guffawed together. She wanted to flush it down the toilet. " " Did n't you have qualms? " I asked him. " Did n't I have what? " " Qualms. About keeping the money. " " Why, Hy? " " It was Solly 's money. " " No, Hy. I had no... qualms. " " Why not? " " It was n't Solly 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hershie paused and rubbed his hand against his mouth. " You see, Solly had said at first it was all for the sake of science. But it turned out to be C.O.D. Just C.O.D. " " So why did you take the $5,000 if you did n't intend to use it? " " We did n't want Solly to know we were gon na stay put. We were dangerous to him that way. We were in his way. " On the following day, I said to Hershie, " Did you draw up a sketch of the bomb that Solly wanted? " " Yes I did, " Hershie replied. " I wrote out all the information for Solly. " " And you gave Solomon Rubell all of this information? " " Yes. " " Have you prepared for us a replica of your sketch, the one you gave to Rubell that day? " " Yes, I have. " " And it is very much like the sketch you gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We offer this in evidence, My Honor, " said I. " This is diabolical! " shouted Solly 's lawyer, Henky Rubin, running down the aisle. " What will happen to our vital juices? I insist that the court impound this exhibit so that it remains a national secret. " Judge Goldman looked at me. I looked at Him. Duboff, my colleague, stared. We all looked at Henky Rubin. " In the name of all that 's good, please, Your Honor, do n't let the enemy be apprised of this material. " Henky trembled. " Henkey, " I said, " I know how you feel, and I love you for it. " " I do too, " said Duboff. " I love you more than Hy does. " No you do n't, ficklepuss, " said I. I turned to Henky Rubin. " Look, this is incredibly generous, coming from the defense. Albeit a little weird. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I love my country, and I want to keep it that way. I 'm not going to allow a foreign power to use this stuff to undermine our juices. " " If I had made this suggestion, " I said, " there might have been criticism of my trying to ramrod something through. But you, you heavenly creature, you did it yourself. I thought you said Hershie was a moron, that he could n't find his own mother 's pussy. " " He spotted the pussy, " Henky said. Judge Goldman said, " There might have been some question on appeal. But since the defense is making the request, the question is removed entirely. " " We are all Americans, " said Henky. He joined hands with me and Duboff. " We may have our little disputes, but we do n't want to see our country doublecrossed. " " Your hand is warm, Henky, " I said. " The sketch and material shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a glass of water? " Solly whispered to Henky, his face chalk white. " Sure thing, Solly, " Henky said. In his excitement, Henky handed Solly an empty glass. The Rubell case was a lead-pipe cinch. Sometimes somebody being cute asks if I feel sympathy for the Rubells. I do n't understand the question. They were pishers. They had nothing. Solly and Dolly did n't fuck for three years after they met because they did n't know where to put what. This I know for a fact. They needed a push in life, somebody behind them. So they went to the Soviets. And they got a quality friendship. And for a while they were somebodies. They are n't any more. " What kind of animals am I dealing with here? " Henky Rubin screamed at the sentencing. " What kind do you want? " I asked him. II : The Uncle. I met Solly in the fall of 1937 at City College. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly. He was there early and late. He was not too bright. I could see Solly getting involved with the Russians, trying to help : this aspect of looking for a parent. A very strange, unhappy young man. Lonely, always there in the alcoves, always away from home. He did n't have depth. I saw his kids quite often after the execution. When the Springers adopted the kids, they looked for people who had knowledge of the Rubells. They wanted to provide continuity, not treat the parents as outcasts. I played chess with Joseph. He used to play chess with his father. So I was Uncle Henry. The Springers had a family conference every week where anyone could bring up any subject. They operated by majority vote. The Jewish community was concerned about the Communists raising the kids. The Jewish Child Care Association came with the police and took them away. Joseph and Amy held hands all the way to Pleasantville, New York, where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goyim, protecting the good name of the Jews : this is what I call a Jewish judge sentencing the Rubells on the eve of Yom Kippur. I think it was part of a primitive purification rite for him that was very vulgar. In order to wrest control from the Communists, a WASP, Dean Smyth of the New York School of Social Work, was appointed co-guardian. The kids ' grandmother, Sarah Rubell, was the other co-guardian, but Smyth was main man. The other grandmother said that if the kids were sent to her, she would throw them out the window. Sarah Rubell said to the kids : " Look what your mother did to my son. " The Springers would bring food and clothes to Sarah 's house for the kids. Sarah would hide them. No American culture, no Eastern European culture either. Prost, common. But this does n't get the mood. She would speak against blacks. She would rail against this woman who took her son away. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph read the Daily Worker. After Amy went to sleep, he wanted to engage in political discussion : never a cultural or recreational matter. He announced his desire to become a lawyer. Vindication was the key word. The adoption process was still under consideration. Dean Smyth allowed the kids to live with the Springers more and more. To me the amazing thing was their continued sanity. Joseph was a consummate actor. When Dean Smyth visited the Springer house, Joseph wanted to demonstrate what excellent foster parents they would be. He would eat an apple and say, " You know, Dean, Mrs. Springer says an apple a day keeps the doctor away. " He 'd sit down and play the piano and say, " You know, Dean, Mrs. Springer says culture is very important. " Joseph had a bar mitzvah. The dean needed it to satisfy the Jewish community. But he treated it very seriously. Not really a put-on. Joseph sang and he recited. Dean Smyth cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was magnificent. He said, " I wish I had taped it. " Joseph said, " I 'll do it all over again. " The dean arranged for the adoption by the Springers. In the wee hours of the morning they all descended from different parts of the city, pretending they did n't know each other as they walked up the steps of the courthouse. The dean had pneumonia and came out of a sickbed to get it done. He died the next day. The community wanted the kids to be punished for what their parents did. I did n't have a kid of my own. What do you do with children, you play. I became the uncle. I 'd do multiple accents. I 'd wear my glasses on my head. I see Solly 's face before me. A young guy with a mustache, which struck me as strange. My concept of a yeshiva bocher, somebody who had not come of a more cultured background. He wore a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph was growing a little stubble of a mustache. He turned his profile and said, " Who do I look like? " I said, " You look like Joseph. " He said, " No no no. " And I said, " you look like Joseph. " And he said, " Come on now. " I said, " You want me to say you look like Solly? You look like Solly. Does that make you happy? " He said, " Yeah, it does make me happy. " III : The Hermit Smorg. Sid Smorg of South Philadelphia kept squares of Swiss chocolate in his mother 's refrigerator. They were his luxury, late at night, in his room. He did n't deserve them. Jews were burning. A bald, virginal, fatting man, at forty-two the chemist remembered what others had long packed away : the girl he shared a seat with in the ninth grade, how she felt at his side, her smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve on a winter day ; his rabbi 's words at his bar mitzvah. Once, at eight, he was swimming ; a girl appeared beside him in the pool, said " You 're handsome, " and dove away. Sid remembered his two years of YMCA summer camp. Frail and sickly, he gained seven pounds each summer. He learned to love spinach( a passion he kept the rest of his life), played soccer, and shivered with delight on the boulders around the campfire while the counselors told ghost stories. Sid developed a sound appetite. Years later, his Soviet friend Alexei would say fondly, " Sic will eat anything that will stand still long enough and that wo n't eat him first. " Sid read manuals on how to appeal to the opposite sex. He kept a bowl of apples on his kitchen table, because he had read that apples kept the breath sweet. You could win Sid 's gratitude by asking him how things were going. He thanked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week for Fibber McGee to open his closet, and he listened to Jack Benny for eighteen years. When Sid was in his senior year of high school, his English teacher gave an exam in his class and then asked Sid to remain afterward. He asked Sid to take the exams home and grade them that night. Some of the other kids saw Sid take the exams. They surrounded him in the hallway, pleading with him to pass them. Many of them had not even bothered to speak with him before. Sid saw many new attractive attributes in them. Sid took the exams home and sat up until five a.m., erasing wrong answers and filling in the right ones, even faking the kids ' handwriting. When he was through, they had all passed. Sid downgraded his own paper to make things look less suspicious. Sid handed the exams in to the teacher. In the afternoon Sid met him in the hallway. The teacher said, " The class did very well, did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked away. This comment burned into Sid. For twenty-two years he thought about it and considered looking up the teacher in the phone book, apologizing, and explaining why he had acted as he did. Each year when the new phone book arrived, Sid looked at the women 's names and wondered what they were like. Stephanie Schnall : a tremulous librarian with suppressed emotions and chestnut hair ; Bridget Hart, a red-haired vixen who kept a little braided whip in her glove compartment. Russ Colombo broke Sid 's heart, and he had a special shot of Grable 's legs in his chest drawer under his shirts and mismatched socks. The seasons came and went ; Sid sat quietly in the bus on the way to work watching the young lovers, the cycles. People 's grief gave him strength -- he cheered up. When his friend Tom Leeds introduced him to the Soviets, Sid was uncertain. He considered himself a Norman Thomas Socialist. But he saw these were interesting men. The Philadelphia Communists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gap-toothed wonders -- no way he would join those furry nuts. The party was their glory, it made them shoot up a few inches. Tom had taken him to their meetings, hoping Sid would join. The walls of the local party office were papered with drawings of brawny, upright workingmen in overalls with upraised, gigantic muscled arms and capitalists with fat cigars and big bellies sitting on piles of coins. The leaders, with their pipes, tweedy vests, and blank faces, had this " you go out and get your heads cracked, it 's only the cops " attitude. He saw a small black woman make a suggestion about a demonstration and the leader coldly respond : " We will decide who we will learn from. " She steadied herself by putting her hand on the chair. One angry Greek exploded at the Marxian dialectics( does the party shake the workers or do the workers shake the party?) and shouted, " The hell with this bullshit -- give me five good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The meetings broke up at 4 a.m. The were dominated by what the Swiss called the " ploeder sacker, " the endlessly boring talkers. Sid could n't take those pig festivals on the Jewish holidays -- the Jewish Communists ' celebration of the pig. Not just spareribs in Chinese restaurants, mind you -- okay, that was odd on Yom Kippur, but they thought they were proving they were n't narrow Zionists. But pictures of pigs on the mantelpiece! Pig recipes! Poems! Sex tips! This was excess, Sid thought. In his parents ' house he 'd lived in the same room since childhood. Sid had sat in the back row in the living room beside his bachelor uncles in the darkening dusk. Uncle Simon was known for his Republican rage. You never mentioned FDR in his presence. If you did, he turned livid and screamed, then did n't talk to anyone for days. Whenever Simon sat quietly in his chair, everyone assumed he was thinking about how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Tom, he was touched by Alexei 's concern. Also Alexei was dark and handsome, which Sid could n't help admiring, and had a lock of hair that kept falling over his forehead. " Sic Sid Sid Sid! "( Imagine, hearing his name said over and over again.) " Sid-Sid-Sidney, " said Alexei, gazing at Sid fondly, licking a vodka martini, " I do n't expect our boys to be social butterflies, but this is ridiculous. What can we do with you? You 're so pale. You do n't play cards, you have no girl. You think we do n't care about these things? " Sid sat, his head down, eating it up. Come on Alexei, you guys do n't care that much. Blood came to Sid 's face. To have such friends -- and to help the USSR at the same time, the only country where anti-Semitism was a crime against the state. Anything that strengthened the USSR would help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes when Alexei told him that Stalin had struggled to learn Yiddish, that he dovened when he prayed. This was no normal leader. The Jew thing, who could ignore it? Sid had gone to the library every day as a boy, walking the two miles. The Neckers festered near the city dump amid mosquitos, raising hogs. They were kids who lived in the marshy wasteland of Stonehouse Lane and did lightning forays on Sid 's neighborhood, throwing bricks and smashing windows. When he was fifteen, they beat him. Blood dripping down his face, he watched the legs of his friends skitter away into the bushes. Sid 's father, one of the few Jews at the factory, was baited by the other workers. They stole his chisels ; they put glue on his good clothes. Yus Smorg struck a man who grinned and ran together the words " HiJew? " and almost lost his job because the man had a weak heart and fainted. Yus Smorg 's foreman told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He moved him to a quicksilver production line where Yus was the only worker hand sanding cabinets. He came home at night with the skin rubbed off his fingertips. Sid 's mother would bathe Yus 's fingers and put ointment on them. Sid 's father went back to work the next morning without a word of complaint. Sid graduated from the university in 1932 and went to work as a laboratory worker at the Richmond Sugar Company. He was now a main support of his family. One week before Christmas, he was laid off. He searched frantically for a job, walking in a perspiring heat in snow and slush against tides of smiling, happy, employed workers with tinsel on their faces, bearing green, gold, and red boxes with silver bells to their families as carols tinkled from store fronts. This was capitalism. As he approached a factory gate, a bundled laborer walked towards him and asked what he wanted. When Sid told him, the man snarled, " Better go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " One night a co-worker of his, Fred Stone, came over with the news that a former classmate of Fred 's, Tom Leeds, was leaving his job at the Terrill Manufacturing Company in Jersey City and might be able to put Sid in his place. A week later a telegram arrived : Sid was told to come to Jersey City that night to see Tom Leeds. He anxiously packed a brown cardboard suitcase, borrowed six dollars and a jacket that closely matched his pants, and took a Greyhound to Jersey City. Leeds was waiting for Sid in front of his house. Tom Leeds 's biceps could make a man blush. Plus a huge, friendly, freckled face, pug nose, the grin, the feel of the bear-like grip of his hand. They sat up until morning talking. Leeds briefed Sid on soap chemistry. Then there were " complicating circumstances. " The boss, Roger Whitman, would never hire a Jew. Sid would have to say that despite his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converted and married a Christian girl. Then Leeds got down to brass tacks. He told Sid he was a Communist party member, and that he had purposely selected Sid for the job because Fred had told him that Sid was a Socialist. Tom said, " We figure that when you really know the score you 'll want to struggle for real change. " Leeds talked for three more hours about how mankind had advanced to a new level in the Soviet Union. Sid was hired the next day. Roger Whitman told him what a great man Hitler was, and how the Jews in the United States should be put on ships and the vessels sunk in midocean. Sid 's thirty-dollar-a-week salary kept his family off relief. He repaid Tom by consenting to go to Communist party meetings in Jersey City, which he detested. He could n't hurt Tom 's feelings when Tom asked him to join the party. He said that he felt he " must be adequately prepared first " in the tomes of **26;230;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be worthy to take such a step. Tom was moved, but tried to assure Sid that there " were years to go to drink from the fountain of **26;258;TOOLONG ; the party will guide you. " In the fall of 1933, Sid was rehired by the Richmond Sugar Company. Tom kept coming to see him in Philadelphia, where they would meet at the Automat and Sid would splurge on his favorites, mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. Tom talked for hours about Soviet justice. Tom was also welcomed by Sid 's family at his home, where he was considered their savior for having given Sid a job. One night Tom began their conversation by telling Sid about yet another incident of discrimination so typical of American society. He had attended the Christmas party of his Jewish girl 's company. The party was sedate and dignified, with good, rich food. Near the end, a partner in the firm who did not know Tom 's girl was Jewish, rose and proposed a toast : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am so thankful there are no others in this firm. " After a long pause, Tom said, " Sic, the Soviet people eat off rough bare boards. You can help them live a little better, a little more as humans should, by getting this information. " He said that he had met a man who worked for Amtorg, the Soviet trading company, in New York City. The man wanted to obtain -- " unofficially " -- a variety of specialized information and data on American chemical processes. The information on paper fillers, vitamin D concentrates, and sulphinated oils could greatly benefit the lives of the Soviet people. It could affect education( paper), food( fish-oil concentrates), and clothing( sulphinated oils). Tom said that a great deal more information was also needed about products made by the Richmond Sugar Company. They would go a long way towards making the harsh life of Soviet citizens, still in the first stage of socialist humanism, less difficult. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sid? " Tom asked, that wonderful brisk look of love in his eyes, a look no one had ever bestowed on Sid before. Sid said, " I 'll have to think this over. " Actually, he had already made up his mind. His pulse was pounding. This was great. Tom was his benefactor. Sid had been living in sin for so long in avoiding the Communist party membership Tom wanted so badly for him. He felt he had been breaking Tom 's heart, and he hated himself for it. He had torn clumps of hair out of his head at night in anger at himself. Now he could please Tom, get him off his neck about joining that bunch of furry nuts in the Communist party, and strengthen the Soviet Union, his people 's best friend, as well. Sid dove into the air and chased a fly. IV : The Catholic Boy. He was nine years old. He lived between Croton Falls, New York, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were all kinds of memories there connected with the Union Army. The imaginations of the farmers in that area were still linked to the Republican party, back to the Civil War. Even though two world wars had intervened, to them America was the Republican party. The Republican party had saved the Union. They knew there were Democrats in places like New York City, but they were people who were n't like them. During the 1952 election he remembers standing at the bus stop with the farmers ' kids and telling them his father supported Adlai Stevenson. They were all a little bit amazed and pissed off, calling him a Democrap. They had never even heard of one in the flesh before. Nor an Irish Catholic either. The afternoon that the Rubells were executed, he was with the family of his friends. They were on the front lawn of the old farmhouse. The farmer had knocked off somewhat early from his day 's work. He was out on the front porch with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chet and Mercer Hough. His father used to call him " Farmer Hough, " so he does n't recall his first name. It was a beautiful, spacious farmhouse with a big front lawn and huge oak and maple trees. The kids were playing catch and fooling around. He remembers the Houghs ' concern that the president might weaken, that he might give in and grant clemency to these people. Now he finds it hard to remember if he knew they were the Rubells, if he knew they were Jewish, if he knew what they had been convicted of. He suspects he did n't. He thinks he knew they were spies, probably that they were Communists -- primarily that they were traitors. The Houghs thought there was a big danger right then : that very powerful influences might get to the president. The Rubells were people who deserved to be punished. The kids picked this up from the parents. The feeling was there had been a lot of weakness in the country, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would just be more weakness. They did n't think he would, because this was a tough guy. But the feeling was that there were enormous forces that made even the president somewhat weak in comparison. Now he understand what they thought those " forces " were -- the Jews, who somehow controlled the world -- but he was just a kid then. Real Americans wanted these people executed, but real Americans were weak and beleaguered. They 'd been pushed around and they were probably going to get pushed around again -- but maybe the president had enough guts to hold out. So it was a vigil. They were waiting, in this countryside. This house and farm were the only ones in sight. They had this little valley to themselves. There were no other human beings around. Farmer Hough 's farm and cows and a few kids. And a radio. It was well known that there were people who lived up Lake Mahopac who would buy carps when you caught them. It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because you did n't eat them. And they did n't fight, so you 'd think you were just hauling out a lot or a tire. But you could get a dollar for them. They did n't know what the Jews did with them, but they 'd heard that they ate the eyes. No one the boy knew was going to eat fish that lived down in the mud and ate all the garbage off the bottom of the pond. Suddenly there was a hush and they drew around the crackling radio. " The Rubells are dead at last, " the announcer said. There was a sense of relief, not exaltation : " Well, that 's over, " and it turned out all right. The radio was snapped off. They went back to playing catch. Things had n't gone wrong. There were vigils going on at Union Square, at Sing Sing, in left-wing neighborhoods. They had participated in another kind of vigil. He remembers a very pleasant summer day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beautiful day. BY DAVID EVANIER
