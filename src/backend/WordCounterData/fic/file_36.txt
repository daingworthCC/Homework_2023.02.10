1005741 Through the Looking Glass : Madness, Menopause and Me <p> Perhaps I was the only member of the off our backs collective who did n't work for the FBI. That 's why they wanted me gone. <p> They kept talking about how they had caught the office rat in a trap, but I knew they were n't just talking about a rodent. The rat was a code word for me. They had trapped me and were letting me know that they wanted me dead, like the rat. <p> I went to a movie with some of the oob collective and they laughed at the parts of the movie that obviously were attacks on me. I was surprised that a movie as Hollywood-looking as In and Out had been made as an attack on me, but perhaps someone called the theater ahead of time and we were shown a specially altered version. <p> Even worse than the main feature was the coming attraction, which was about a mouse that disrupted somebody 's apartment in the middle of the night and kept them awake. My collective sisters must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kept me awake all night, and they laughed and found it funny. They even laughed when the movie said, " Where is the cat? " <p> They must have known that my cat kept disappearing and someone kept substituting another cat for her. If I stayed on off our backs, someone would take the cat away. <p> It was a choice between the newspaper I had worked on for 24 years and my cat. I chose my cat and left the collective. But in the next few days, someone stole my cat anyway and left me with this other cat. It was a fairly nice cat, but not as sweet as mine. I worried that it might be an altered male and that if I took it to the vet for shots, the vet would charge me with passing off a false cat as mine and take it away from me. I did n't want to lose this cat, too. <p> Weeks before, the FBI had taken away my lover, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like her. Then they did the same to all of my friends. As soon as I told someone that the FBI was trying to frame me for a crime I did n't commit, she would be taken away and hidden by the Federal Witness Protection Program and someone else would be substituted for her. <p> I could cope if they 'd just stop putting drugs in my food and water. I 've always hated drugs. I never tried any except marijuana, and I did n't like that. <p> Clever of them to guess that was a good way to break me, but I would n't give in. I could never tell when food would be drugged, so I ate as little as possible and drank as little as I could. My glasses were all coated with drugs, so when I was desperate, I 'd pour water into my cupped hands and slurp down what I could. Then they put drugs in the pipes, so even that water was n't safe. <p> When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hardly make it to the bed, I was so exhausted. <p> It happened at my favorite restaurants. I was betrayed everywhere. All of the stores on my block had been taken over by the FBI. <p> I wanted to brush my teeth, but my toothbrush and toothpaste were drugged, so I kept buying new ones. I had long since stopped getting new keys for my apartment because nothing, not even the chain lock, could keep the FBI out. <p> The worst drugs were the ones that made me hardly able to speak. Just before collective meetings, I 'd be given drugs so I could n't be coherent and tell the collective what was happening, in case any of them still were their real selves. Someone had wiretapped the phones at oob and could hear every word that we said, just as my home and my office had been bugged. <p> Whenever I tried to read a book, I could tell that it had been altered with special messages inserted for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscribed to were the same. I could n't read the truth anywhere. <p> What I could n't figure out was why they would bother. I did n't think that what I did was that important. They must see taking over off our backs as a way to take over the whole feminist and gay movements. <p> I did n't dare call any of the famous feminists who I thought might help me, because I was afraid they 'd be " disappeared " if I did. I wanted to protect them, if something had n't happened to them already. <p> Who could I trust, anyway? My office had forced me to take medical leave and get a psychiatric evaluation. <p> I tried calling psychiatrists, but I could n't find any who could see me within the time allotted and write up an evaluation. <p> Then my lover and my friends Tricia, Jennie, and Karla told me they 'd made an appointment with a psychiatrist for me and I should go with them right away. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was before the clones had been substituted for them -- maybe). <p> The only psychiatrist on call at my HMO was a man, and that 's who I had to see. I told my friends that I might walk out on him, because I had n't seen a male doctor in decades, and I had never seen a male shrink. <p> He was bland and would n't say much about his philosophy. After a few minutes, I politely said that I was uncomfortable that he was a man and left. <p> Then my friends huddled in the corridor and demanded that I go to the emergency room. I refused. I was n't violent, I was n't shouting, so why should I have to go? <p> They insisted, and finally I went, though I kept saying, " You do n't know what you 're doing. " I might get locked up. <p> I gave them the phone numbers of every friend, relative, and famous feminist who might help me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gatekeeping emergency room nurse did n't want to let a friend in with me, but I claimed that Karla was my cousin, grabbed her hand, and pulled her through the doors. She seemed like a good choice because she had always been anti-therapy.( At that point, I believed that she was the real Karla.) <p> Just as I feared, the emergency room people all looked and sounded like cops. They made me get a CAT-Scan, which they said was to learn whether I had a brain tumor, which I thought was ridiculous. Of course it showed that I did n't. <p> But the doctor wanted to hospitalize me. I begged Karla to take me home. When the doctor left the room, Karla said she thought I needed an anti-psychotic drug! Some friend. I shrieked her name and clutched harder. She did n't get it. She 'd always been anti-therapy, but she did n't get it. <p> Finally, the doctor agreed to let me out if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and night. They agreed, keeping me from my worst nightmare, winding up in a hospital for crazy people, just like both my father and my mother. Damned FBI knew what my worst fear was, but I would n't talk. I would n't confess to something I had n't done. <p> I had to go to a psychiatrist, a woman this time. I had to take drugs, which scared the shit out of me, but I was afraid that the FBI would check my blood and find out if I did n't take them. If the drugs ruined my mind, I could stop taking them, as long as I could keep out of the hospital. <p> Somewhat to my surprise, I discovered that I really believed in some aspects of the United States political system, such as the Bill of Rights. We had always believed that the FBI had rifled through oob 's office once in 1973 after we had received a communication from the Weather Underground( nothing was stolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I had never imagined that if they wanted to go after me they would try to get me into a mental hospital rather than filing charges against me. I wanted to be confronted with the charges, whatever they were. I wanted my day in court. I was sure that I could pass a polygraph test about just what I had and had n't done. <p> I tried to find a lawyer, but the only one I talked with said I had n't done anything actionable and need not worry. I did n't believe him. Perhaps he was really an agent, too. <p> Afraid of the damage I might cause to famous feminists by appealing to them, I went the only place I could think of -- to the American Civil Liberties Union. I hoped that anti- -pornography feminists would n't think I was a traitor for asking the ACLU for help. Even there, a nice old woman who was not an attorney told me that I did n't need to worry. I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't seem like an agent. But when even the ACLU could n't help me, I knew that I had no place to go. I had to cooperate with the FBI as best I could. <p> Then my friends and the psychiatrist wanted me to go to a psychiatric day care program. That is, they said it was a psychiatric day care program. but really every person there, both staff and so-called patients, was a cop. I could tell. The majority of the patients were supposed to be poor people on Medicaid, but they were too articulate, nice, and thoughtful to be real poor, mentally ill people. They were cops, pretending, and they were damned good actors. <p> At least the food was n't poisoned. After I had taken the drugs for a while, they stopped poisoning my food. It was great to be able to go to a store and buy real food, anything I wanted. Everything looked delicious. <p> But I still had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where all of my friends were gone and I had to conclude that I would never see them again. I wanted to be honest, but I could see where that would get me -- back to the emergency room. <p> I was limited to a pseudo-community, with pseudo-Mandy, pseudo- Ginny, pseudo Tricia, everybody pseudo. Some were more convincing than others at their roles. <p> I had to act as if they were the real people themselves, except of course I could n't really kiss the woman who was pretending to be my lover. It broke my heart that my lover had let the FBI take her away, but maybe she did n't have a choice. Well, I had lived with heart-break before. <p> It surprised me that I still wanted to stay alive. I knew how people survived wars. Somehow there was that instinct to want to see trees, to want to keep on living, even though I had lost everything. <p> Perhaps I would still be allowed to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collective. They said they would publish an article of mine, so I dared to come back. Perhaps they would pretend to accept me again. <p> They did. Maybe they were n't agents after all. <p> after the fall <p> That was my world last fall. I fell out of my life like Alice falling through the rabbit hole. Although I had feared mental illness all of my life because my mother wound up with Alzheimer 's disease and my father was severely mentally disturbed after he had a series of strokes, I had no idea that I could lose myself so quickly, so easily. <p> Now that I tell people about my life behind the looking glass, they ask what age I am. <p> " Fifty-one, " I say. <p> " Ah, menopause, " is the reply. <p> I had never heard that menopause could do that. Have you? <p> None of the books that I 've seen say that biochemical changes could make you paranoid. They talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about craziness, real madness. <p> That angers me. I ought to have known. You ought to know that it 's possible to lose a large part of yourself or your world. <p> And you ought to know that it 's easily curable. <p> I hated the idea of drugs affecting my mind. I would never take valium when I was distraught or grief-stricken, as some of my friends did. I believed, I am sure correctly, that doctors in patriarchal society drug many women unnecessarily. And I had seen my mother given strong drugs when she had Alzheimer 's, and it broke my heart. <p> When I was sick, my friends kept telling me that drugs have changed, but I did n't believe them. <p> Not all drugs have changed. People still are getting overdrugged. I met people at the day treatment program who still shake because they were on haldol for years. But I was n't overdrugged. <p> Fortunately I went to doctors who do n't overdrug. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital and to have the lowest drug doses possible, and kept my mouth shut when the drugs did n't end my fears immediately. Within a few weeks, they did. <p> I am taking one milligram of ris-perdal, an anti-psychotic, and 50 milligrams of zoloft, an anti-depressant, a day. I give these doses -- which are considered very low -- because I believe it is important to take the lowest possible dose, and I want anyone who might be in a similar situation to know what worked for me. <p> Menopause is n't the only condition that can trigger the biochemical changes that I went through, but it is one that can. <p> I also faced a tough situation at work in 1997. A number of awful things happened, but I think that I would not have been propelled into paranoia if I had not been going through menopause at the time. <p> I am back at work, and enjoying it, but my supervisory responsibilities were taken away. I am not pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's failure to understand the temporary and curable nature of my illness. However, it is legal because my title was not changed and most of my work responsibilities are the same.I was one of the best supervisors in my place of work, and I think that I should not have to bear any unfavorable consequencs of my illness because I never mistreated or distrusted any of the people whom I supervised. <p> However, there is a part of me that thinks, well, I 'm a radical so I should n't have been a part of management anyway, even at a nonprofit publishing house. <p>( My latest news is that I might be getting some of my supervisory responsibilities back, which is good and appropriate. And I have been invited to be part of an " expanded management team, " so I suppose I can not really avoid the complications and contradictions of being part of management.) <p> There are good effects of my illness. My radicalism has been renewed. Feeling that the FBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize how precious it is to me and how wonderful it is to be able to write and publish articles about radical feminism. <p> Also, being with people who I now realize really were much poorer than I make me see the world differently. One woman had to wait a month to get the new eyeglasses she needed. Others depended on food stamps. One woman, a worker in college dorms, had gotten in trouble because she warned cleaning people to stay out of a room with lice because they had not been told the proper way to clean it without picking up lice themselves. One man had been destitute and alcholic, living on the street. Some heard voices telling them what to do. Yet these were kind, insightful people, who told their stories to help us all as well as themselves. One man who wanted to kill the supervisor who had gotten him fired was particularly insightful in the comments he gave others about our problems. <p> I 'm ashamed to say that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was majority African American. <p> I want to be a better person, but I do n't know whether I will. I do know that I love life more than ever. It is not entirely easy picking up the pieces of my personal life, but everyone is helping me. <p> Virtually all of my friends stood by me. Some male friends at work even suffered some job disadvantages without complaining because they supported me. One of them I now consider one of my best friends( strange for me!). <p> So if you ever think that your friends are all FBI agents, they probably are n't. If they are unanimous in thinking that you are ill, you may very well be ill. Try to trust them. <p> And carry this message to anyone you know who seems to be undergoing unusual behavioral changes. They can be temporary. There is some help out there, although of course you have to be careful who you trust. <p> Life is good. And best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along. And she, as well as my friends, has forgiven me for being less affectionate than usual because I did n't recognize her. <p> One thing is certain. Now I am a crone. <p>
