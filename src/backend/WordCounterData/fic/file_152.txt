1040141 p100 he 's still an adult. The pedophile, when he 's with kids, he becomes a kid. It 's not like a forty-two-year-old guy and a bunch of ten-year-olds ; it 's more like just a bunch of ten-yearolds and one of them is a lot bigger and older-looking. There 's a peer quality in the interaction. " See, I think I told you that a lot of these guys get fixated at some age, probably when they were abused, and they do n't really grow beyond that. Their bodies do, of course, and they learn how they 're supposed to act so they can look like adults, but inside they 're still a kid. At an emotional level, they 're still eight or ten or whatever. " I 'd guess that Reiter 's fixated around nine or ten, right before puberty, so when he 's with these nine-year-olds, he really understands them in ways that a normal adult just does n't. One place you see it is the jokes. Nine-year-old jokes are generally dumb to an adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scream. He can even tell nine-year-old jokes. The kids love it. " " And the Vietnamese kids? " " Victims, too. We 're seeing a lot of victimization of Asian immigrants in San Francisco. They 're perfect prey for these guys. The guy befriends the family ; he 's their friend, their protector, then when he hits on the kid, the kid ca n't say no. He ca n't tell his family, and if he refuses, he 's scared that the family will suffer. So he goes along. " " It 's so ugly, " I said. Marley nodded. The story was much the same at the other two clubs -- testimonials to Judge Reiter 's warmth and generosity of spirit, accolades for his contributions to the community, and at each, a single boy who was particularly close to him. I dropped Marley at the BART station so he could get back to San Francisco, and had a quick dinner in Oakland before my appointment with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house was in Piedmont, a wealthy enclave completely surrounded by Oakland. I 've always wondered how Piedmont 's city fathers got away with carving out a little island of wealth and privilege for themselves and incorporating it as a separate city. They 'd managed to create a WASP 's dream, a community where the range of income ran from very rich to well-to-do. Poor people here were the ones with only two garages. Steve Marley and I had driven by Reiter 's house earlier in the day when we came to interview the director at the recreation center about the computer club. Even in the daytime we 'd needed a street map to find it. It was on Glen Ellen Drive, a street that looked like it belonged in Beverly Hills. The house was an American version of an English manor house, Tudor style with exposed beams and mullioned windows with tiny panes. This was n't a large house ; it was a small mansion. It could easily have sat on a hill overlooking acres of open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an immaculately tended yard with a grumpy French chateau looming over its color-coordinated gardens. The lawn looked as if it had been brushed instead of mowed, and trees that were thoughtless enough to drop leaves were probably pulled out and cut into neatly stacked cords of firewood. This was not a neighborhood where you did surveillance. Any stranger who stopped for more than twenty-five seconds was probably reported to the police department. I wondered how Mitch had gone about his investigation of Reiter. It was n't any easier to find Reiter 's place in the dark. I was glad I knew which house it was. Rich people do n't put up house numbers. The door was opened by a tall, olive-skinned young man in a suit. I was n't sure if he was a butler or a friend. The entrance hall was paneled in dark wood and was larger than my entire living room. You could have played basketball in the living room except that it was stuffed full of furniture. The drapes p102 and couches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be subtly at war with one another. And the exquisite Oriental carpet was n't speaking to either of them. My mother would have been shocked that anyone would put three patterns together and expect them to get along, but the room had obviously been done by a designer, and they play by a different set of rules. The assortment of people in the room got along about as well as the prints. There were five women and three men ; most were in their late forties, early fifties. Two of the women were fashionably close to anorexia, one had clearly stepped over the line, and two had given up the battle and were comfortably overweight. All five wore sweaters and slacks with accessories worth more than most of my better dresses. The men rose when I entered the room, and the tallest of the three came to greet me. I recognized him from the newspaper photographs, though he was a bit heavier than I 'd expected. He was a little shorter than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not really heavy but with the soft paunch that men develop when they forsake exercise but not wine. From Joe and the resume I knew that Reiter must be in his late fifties, but neither his face nor his body gave him away. His hair had receded and thinned, but it was a sandy color that does n't show the gray, and he moved with the ease and vitality of a younger man. " Ms. Sayler, we 're delighted you could join us, he said, then went on to introduce the others and put in a plug for the arts commission 's Mayfest. The Mayfest was to be a community-wide art festival on the first weekend in May. I heard more about it than I wanted to know, but I took notes faithfully and even asked a couple of questions. At one point in college I 'd thought I wanted to be an investigative reporter and had joined the school newspaper. Several weeks of covering meetings like this had convinced me that I 'd never get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours, and my presence probably kept everyone on task and better behaved than they 'd have managed by themselves. Four of the women were involved in Junior League and made frequent references to a conflict in that organization, which they found considerably more interesting than the Mayfest. The most stimulating discussion of the evening involved the boundary between art and craft and the importance of keeping people who crocheted pot holders from exhibiting their wares. The big surprise of the evening was the arrival home of Judge Reiter 's wife, Aileen. This was clearly not the wife Joe had mentioned. This was the trophy wife -- the gorgeous younger woman, the payoff for wealth and power. She was in her late twenties or early thirties with selfassurance and poise beyond her years, the product of a good Eastern college, most likely. Her conservatively tailored suit and briefcase suggested that she was an executive-model trophy wife. Aileen did n't stick around for the interview. Reiter offered me brandy, a real step-up from the coffee he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have an intimate chat in a room the size of a small stadium, but Reiter managed to establish a feeling of intimacy through the intensity of his attention. The man was a master of sincere eye contact. We covered his civic and artistic activities. The list matched the one on his vita. " I notice that a number of your volunteer activities involve work with boys. Can you tell me about the special appeal of that kind of work? " I actually said that with not a hint of irony in my voice, and I kept a straight face. I learned it by watching the White House press corps. " I think my work with boys is the most important thing I do, " he said, giving me a smile, that had helped make some orthodontist rich. " There are so many boys who do n't have fathers at home anymore. They 're desperate for male role models, and there are less of those available all the time. When I p104 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't get on with your father, you had uncles or older cousins. You could go down to the playground and find a director who 'd teach you to play basketball. There were sports, boys ' clubs, Scouts, lots of places boys got together. " Today, the uncles live across town or in another state. The playgrounds do n't have money to do more than cut the grass. The schools ca n't afford extracurricular activities, and too many adults are too busy to coach soccer or lead Scouts. " They do n't know what they 're missing. Believe me, I get far more from the boys I work with than I give. " It was all I could do not to choke at that one, but I must have done a good job of concealing my emotions, because he continued. " I used to coach soccer, but an old knee injury acted up, so now I 'm confined to chess and computer, things like that. " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's part of the joy of being a parent. I missed out on that, but I tell you, I feel like I 've had dozens of sons. Boys I coached ten, fifteen years ago still come back to see me when they 're in town. It 's a great feeling. " Watching his enthusiasm and listening to the obvious pride and affection in his voice, it was hard to hold on to the other reality. I had no doubt that Joe was telling the truth, but I also had no doubt that Reiter believed that he, too, was telling the truth. " I know your professional activities as a judge must keep you very busy, " I said. " How do you find the time for all your volunteer activities? " " I do n't play golf or tennis, " he said with a laugh. " No, seriously, I do n't know how much you know about my life, but I lost my first wife in an accident, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarried. My activities in the community are what got me through that difficult period. I spend much of my professional life dealing with the darker side of human nature. I find the laughter of children a powerful antidote to the p105 grimness of that reality and to any personal depression that I might be tempted to indulge in. " I had plenty to think about on the drive home. I had n't expected Reiter to be a monster, but I was certainly not prepared to find him so likable. My investigation would save some boys from exploitation, but it would cost many more a friend and confidant. p106 I arrived home to find Peter holed up in the bedroom, reading John McPhee, and Molly studying As You Like It to rock accompaniment. Stone had curled up on a sweatshirt she 'd dropped on the floor, and was kneading and purring enthusiastically. His face was set in an expression of glassy-eyed ecstasy that bordered on the lewd. " Steve Marley called, " Molly informed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't good news. Marley 's mother had fallen and was in the hospital. He 'd gone to Ukiah and did n't know how long he 'd be there. A better person would have worried about Marley 's mother, instead of feeling irritated about losing him at a crucial point in the investigation. I was not that better person. The alarm woke me from an unpleasant dream in which I wandered through a trackless forest, trying to find a path out. I had p107 the sense of something ominous following me, but never figured out what it was. It was a dream I was glad to leave unfinished. At the office, over a second cup of industrial-strength coffee, I reviewed my options. The prudent thing to do was to wait for Marley 's return. If we 'd been dealing with an embezzler or even a spy, I 'd have done that, but there was too much at stake to sit back and wait. I could n't know what a day or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't willing to gamble on it. The obvious starting point was the boys themselves. I had three names -- Jon Marcus and Ben Sutter in Oakland, and Mark Lashman in Piedmont. I was fairly sure that all three were being molested by Reiter, and equally sure that none would want to admit it. I 'd have to talk with their parents and convince them to let someone question the boys. I could think of several hundred things I 'd rather do than tell a mother that her son was the victim of a pedophile, but none of those things was going to put a stop to Reiter 's activities, so I poured a third cup of coffee and called Jon Marcus 's mother, Sally. She could see me anytime during the day. I suggested later that morning. Irene Lashman, Mark 's mother, was terribly busy but finally agreed that she could work me in around one today. Rosemary Sutter worked until five but agreed to let me come at six. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that he 'd be at soccer practice. My desk calendar had the name Glosser written across it in red. The week I 'd promised Jesse that I 'd wait was up. I was too busy to do much about it today, but I could get Chris started on a background search. I called her in and told her what I needed. " So you 're going to do it, " she said grimly. Chris is the straight arrow in the office. I could tell that she did n't approve. p108 " Yes, " I said, thinking it was good she worked for me instead of vice versa. I do n't think I 'd have lasted long in Chris 's agency. The first boy, Jon Marcus, lived with his mother and two younger sisters in east Oakland. The neighborhood had never been a particularly affluent one, but the small, sturdy houses had been the pride of working-class families on the way up. By the eighties the working class was shrinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those who could afford to were fleeing the urban jungle for safer havens. The people left on Sally Marcus 's street were the ones who could n't get out. Iron bars on doors and windows announced that the occupants were under siege. Some yards still showed the effects of loving care, but most were knee high in weeds. The Marcus 's house was somewhere in the middle. Someone had made an attempt to keep the lawn alive and mowed, but the house needed a paint job and the windows were so grimy that seeing much through them would be a real challenge. There was n't much to see, anyway. The iron-barred gate that protected the front door made some attempt to appear ornamental. It did n't succeed. I rang the bell, and a dog barked and hurled itself against the door. After a few minutes, the door opened a crack, and a woman peered out at me. The dog -- a tan, fifty-seven-variety mutt -- struggled to thrust its head out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Marcus? " I asked. She nodded. " I 'm Catherine Sayler. I called about the chess club. " She opened the door wider, grabbed the dog by the collar and unlocked the iron gate. She looked about forty-five, but she was probably much younger. Her limp brown hair was straight ; whoever 'd cut it had n't worried much about style. Her pale skin had a sallow cast. She looked tired. p109 The living room had been furnished from Goodwill. Nothing matched, and none of the furniture looked like anything anyone would choose. I sat down on a hideous brownish-yellow tweed sofa and immediately jumped up when something sharp dug into my thigh. Mrs. Marcus stepped forward and pulled a battered toy gun from between the couch cushions. " I 'm sorry, " she said wearily. " I keep telling ' em to clean up their things, but they never listen. " When we 'd gotten settled and I 'd established that the children were out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understand your son is quite active in the chess club at Saint Stephen 's. " " Yes, he 's real good at it, too. He can beat lots of grown-ups. " " Does he spend much time on club activities? " " Oh yes. He 's gone one or two evenings a week and often on the weekends, too. It 's a godsend for a kid like Jon, keeps him out of trouble. In a neighborhood like this, there 's always plenty of that. " I felt my throat and chest tighten. I 'd found exactly what I was looking for, but there was more grief than elation in it. I did not want to tell this woman that the chess club met only for an hour after school once a week and that actual tournaments occurred only a few times a year. And I did n't want to tell her about what was really happening on all those evenings and weekends that Jon was supposed to be at the chess club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face became even paler. When I finished, she said, " I do n't believe it. Jon would n't... " " It 's very hard for a child to resist in a situation like this. We teach them to trust and obey adults. This man has probably spent months winning Jon 's trust and affection. If it happened, Jon was probably too confused to resist, and afterward he felt too guilty to say anything. " " But, the school sponsors this club. " p110 " The school has no idea what 's going on. The man who advises the club, the molester, is a respected member of the community. He 's been doing this for many years, and he 's been very successful at hiding it. " " No, " she said, getting up and beginning to pace. " It just is n't possible. " " Has Jon brought home any expensive gifts, things he would n't have money to buy himself? " " No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked around the room and into the dining room that adjoined it. On a desk in the corner sat a portable computer. " What about the computer? Where did he get that? " " He won it. It was a prize in one of his tournaments. I told you he was good. " Her tone was defensive. She knew, but she could n't admit it, even to herself. " That 's an awfully expensive prize. Have there been others? " The look on her face told me that there had. She was very close to tears, but she was holding them back. " No, it could n't be, " she said fiercely. " Jon needs help with this, " I said. " He probably wo n't admit what 's going on at first, but it 's confusing and upsetting to a child. When someone you trust demands sex in return for their affection and friendship, it 's shattering. And every time it happens, every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. If it continues, it can destroy his ability to trust other people or himself. " " No, no, " she kept repeating. " It 's not happening. " There was a fierceness to her face that was unnerving. " I can recommend a counselor to work with Jon. " " No, " she said. " No. You do n't have any proof. You 're just guessing. " " I do n't know for sure, only Jon can tell us that. But we know the man he 's been with is accused of doing this before. We know that he 's been telling you he 's going to chess club when he is n't, and we know he 's been getting expensive gifts. p111 Will you agree to having him see a counselor? Will you let the counselor work with him, try to find out what 's been happening? It 's the only way to help Jon out of this. " She sank into a chair. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't know what it 's like, you ca n't, trying to raise three kids on next to nothing and nobody helping and nobody even gives a damn. They sell crack up the street, just three houses from here, and there was a drive-by shooting just a couple of blocks away. " Jon 's dad left when I was pregnant with his sister, the little one. Did n't even stick around to find out if it was a girl or a boy. Just left and never looked back. I try, God knows I do, but he 's almost as tall as I am already, Jon is, and he 's always talking back and acting up. He 's only ten. What 's it going to be like when he 's fifteen? " She buried her head in her hands, but still she did n't cry. She seemed totally exhausted. " I just ca n't handle it, " she said. " I ca n't take any more. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of you. Part of Jon 's poor behavior is probably caused by the abuse. Kids who are sexually abused frequently become angry and take it out on people around them, " I said. " With therapy we can turn that around. " She just kept shaking her head. I told her that the counselor would n't charge her to question Jon about the abuse, that the county would provide ongoing counseling for him. I do n't know if she even heard me. She seemed to withdraw into her own misery. Finally, she said, " Well, I just wo n't let him go to chess club anymore. " " That 's a start, but it wo n't deal with the damage that 's already been done. He needs help with this now. If he does n't get that, he 'll continue to have behavior problems. The problems will get worse. " " No, we 'll be okay, " she said. " He wo n't go to chess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the counselor see him? " p112 " No. No, it 's over. " " Please, Mrs. Marcus. It 's not over for Jon, and it ca n't really be over until he 's faced it and worked through all the feelings and confusion it 's created. " " I do n't hold with all the psychology stuff, and we do n't go telling our family problems to strangers, " she said stiffly. " Jon is the victim of a crime, a serious crime. You can help the police put the criminal away. You and Jon can stop him from doing this to any other child. " " Crime? Tell me about crime. They 're killing people on the streets and the police do n't do nothing about it. Leave me alone, lady. I 've already got more problems than I can handle. I do n't need more. " A bitterness had crept into her tone and a stubbornness. I was n't going to get any further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told her to call if she changed her mind. p113 Piedmont appears particularly lush when you come from the obvious poverty of east Oakland. It 's enough to make a liberal weep and a radical start building bombs. It did n't do a lot for my already sinking spirits. The Lashmans ' house was fairly modest in comparison to the mansions and Architectural Digest candidates that make up much of Piedmont. In any other neighborhood, it would have been a nice middle-class house, but its address bumped it up to lowerupper or upper-middle or whatever they call the wannabe rich. The woman who answered the door was tall, blond, and fashionably thin. She was wearing jeans and a Western-style shirt, but the look was anything but casual, more on the order of Vogue does the Old West. " Mrs. Lashman? " " Yes? " The voice had a sharpness to it. She probably thought I was selling magazine subscriptions. " I 'm Catherine Sayler. I called about the computer club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please. " Her tone thawed a few degrees. She led me to a living room furnished with metal, glass, and p114 leather, and offered me a chair that looked like it had been designed by the Marquis de Sade. I took a bit longer getting to the point this time. Irene Lashman seemed made of tougher stuff than Sally Marcus, but I wanted to avoid the reaction my revelations had produced the last time. Where Sally 's face had broadcast her every reaction, Irene 's was a mask. No emotion was allowed to reach the surface, but the muscles around her mouth tightened as I spoke. Between her silence and lack of expression, she gave me as much feedback as a statue, making it impossible to guess the impact my words were having on her. She remained that way until I finished. Then she said very coolly, " Those are very serious allegations. " " Yes, they are. The impact of this sort of abuse is very serious. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help -- a lot of support from you and professional counseling. " Before I could go on, she stopped me. " I do n't know who you are or why you 're doing this, but Judge Reiter is a good friend of this family, and I wo n't hear any more attacks on his character. I think you 'd better go. " She rose to see me out, but I remained seated. " I know it 's difficult to even contemplate the possibility. No parent wants to think that something like this could happen to their child, but if you do n't at least consider it, you risk leaving Mark in a terrible situation. " " I asked you to leave, " she said. " If you do n't, I 'll call the police. " " Then you 're not even going to ask Mark? " " Of course not. " " Let me at least tell you what kind of signs you might look for to tell you that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head. " I do n't need to know. This is a fine Christian family and my son is a fine young man. Your suggestions are a profound insult. " " A victim is not responsible for what 's done to him, " I p115 said. " This is not Mark 's fault, and it 's no reflection on his character. " " I will not have you try to involve my family in this sort of filth. And I wo n't have you interfere with his relationship with Judge Reiter. If you so much as mention my son 's name to anyone, you will hear from my lawyer. " I struggled to keep anger from my voice. " This is not a matter of social standing. This is your son 's life. I can understand that you do n't want to believe that Mark is a victim. That 's a normal reaction. But I ca n't understand how you can leave him in jeopardy... " I wanted to add " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before your child 's wel-fare, " but I did n't. Instead, I got up and went to the front door. There I stopped and took out my card. " If you change your mind and want help with this, please call me. I can put you in touch with a juvenile officer who specializes in helping boys like Mark. " She did n't take the card, so I put it on the hall table and left. I was shaking with rage by the time I got into my car, but I did n't want to sit in front of the La'shman house while I waited for it to pass. I drove very slowly around the corner and pulled into the curb. I knew with a sickening certainty that both boys were victims. Jon would turn to a man who offered stability and safety. The gifts, things he could never afford to have, would sweeten the appeal, but it would be the sense of being cared for by a strong, protecting adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess what Reiter would offer Mark to win his trust and devotion. Raised in a home where appearance and social position were all-important, the boy would be an easy mark for a powerful man who seemed to like him just for himself. p116 I could understand Sally Marcus. She had used herself up in the daily struggle of life, and she no longer possessed the strength to protect her son. But Irene Lashman was another matter. Her need to maintain an acceptable facade, a respectable social position, was more important to her than her son 's welfare. She seemed to me almost as bad as Reiter. I had over four hours before my appointment with Rosemary Sutter. It took that long to calm down. I took a long walk around Reiter 's neighborhood. The houses were spectacular, yards designed and maintained by professionals -- all the beauty money can buy. Another time I might have enjoyed it, but after my visit to Irene Lashman, it depressed me. All this wealth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I thought of Molly. What did she need? And could I give it to her? She bounced between pleasant, easygoing sociability and sullen hostility. I was n't handling the hostility well. I was awkward in my new role of surrogate parent, and in my frustration, I came down on Molly harder than I intended and created more problems than I solved. Being a parent was such a big responsibility and the costs were so appalling if you failed. It was easy to pity Sally Marcus and feel contempt for Irene Lashman, but I 'd been fitting Molly in around the other demands in my life. She was far more important to me than this case could ever be, yet tonight I 'd be late getting home and the time I 'd been planning to have with her would get put off again. It was a short drive down the hill to Grand Avenue in Oakland. Grand runs right up to the end of Lake Merritt, an urban jewel in a setting that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a nice small-town feel to it. Many of the buildings date from the forties, and while most p117 are well maintained, few have been indulged with fancy face-lifts. The Sutters ' apartment was in a building a block from Grand Avenue in a neighborhood no longer grand but still comfortable. I rang and identified myself. A muffled female voice told me to come on up to 312 on the third floor. The buzzer let out a sound like a dental drill from hell, and I pushed the iron gate open and followed the directions to 312. Rosemary Sutter was a small woman, barely over five feet. Her curly black hair was cut short and her large brown eyes reflected the smile on her lips. " Do come in, " she said warmly. She offered me a chair and perched on the edge of the sofa, watching me expectantly. " What 's this about the chess club? " she asked. The story got harder with each telling, and the stakes got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents to have their son see Steve Marley, I 'd have to start all over again on the search for victims, and the further back in time I had to go, the colder the trail would become. Without a victim willing to speak up, there 'd be no way to stop the judge from seducing and destroying the boys who came to trust him. There 'd be no way to get help for Jon and Mark and Ben, no satisfaction for Joe, no justice for Mitch. I tried a different approach. " Have you noticed any changes in your son 's behavior since he joined the chess club? " I asked. The question surprised her, but she considered it. " He joined about a year ago. I do n't recall any changes then. " Something in her tone told me to push on. " How about since then? " She fidgeted and looked uncomfortable. " Why do you ask? " " Because I think that something may have happened at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have caused a change in his behavior. " " What? " she asked sharply. p120 I could see her relief at having something concrete to do. " Just tell me where and when to bring him, " she said. " I 'll be honest with you, " I said. " This is n't going to be easy on Ben. He 's apt to resist it. It may take some time. " " I understand. " " He 'll want to avoid it. There 'll be a tremendous desire to ignore it and hope it 'll go away. " " You ca n't do that, " she said grimly. " It does n't work. " I wondered what experience had taught her that, but she was n't about to tell me, and I was n't anxious to know. I 'd seen enough human misery already today. I gave her my phone number and told her that I 'd ask Steve Marley to call her. I was so tired that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three interviews, maybe two hours ' total, but so much pain. I found a cafe on Grand Avenue where I could get something to eat. I hoped that food would give me some energy, but I knew that my exhaustion had little to do with nutrition. I wondered how many boys Samuel Reiter had abused during his lifetime. How many lives had he torn apart? How many boys had learned too young that you ca n't trust anyone? p121 When you 're in hurry, it 's easy to make mistakes. But when you 're in a hurry, you tend to forget that. I 'd been in such a hurry to get the Reiter case wrapped up that I had n't wanted to wait for Steve Marley 's return. When he called that night, he did n't hide his displeasure at my activities. " You went to see the parents? I never talk to parents. You should have gone to the Oakland police and let them handle it. " I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said, " and besides, I got what I was after. Rosemary Sutter is willing to have you interview Ben. How soon do you think you can do it? " Marley had already told me that his mother 's fall had produced no more serious injuries than a number of ugly bruises. She was not the kind of woman to hang around the hospital, and had gone home and resumed spading the garden as soon as she could bully the doctor into releasing her. Marley could stick around and paint her kitchen or go home and paint his own. I figured I could make him a better offer. p122 " I could drive back tonight, " he said. " If you can set it up for tomorrow, I 'll see him then. If not, we could do it Monday. " " I 'll try for tomorrow, " I said. Rosemary was as anxious as I was to get moving. She offered to bring Ben to my office the next morning. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few polite questions to get Ben to admit what was going on with Samuel Reiter. " Think of the worst secret you know, the most embarrassing thing you could admit about yourself, and imagine what it would take to get you to tell that to a stranger, " I said. It would take getting through every defense that Ben had erected, building enough trust so he could risk telling the truth, wearing down his resistance until it was easier to talk than to keep covering up, and finally, convincing him that his private pain was not his alone. That was the distance Marley had to cross to reach Ben, and it was full of emotional mines. Marley would begin by establishing rapport and building trust. He 'd ask easy questions to get a sense of how Ben reacted when he was telling the truth, then he 'd move to the harder ones and watch for the subtle signs that the boy was lying or trying to hide something. His questions would tell Ben that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same story from other boys. Slowly, in the hours they spent together, Steve would create the safe space in which Ben could finally open up. Rosemary brought Ben to my office the next morning. She had n't confronted him about Reiter, and he was happy enough to miss a day of school that he did n't ask too many questions about where they were going. Steve took over my office. McGee had already settled in on p123 the couch and saw no reason to leave, and Ben immediately took to the lazy torn and began stroking him. McGee is a shameless hustler. He rolled right over on his back and began purring like mad. I figured Ben could use all the support he could get. For once McGee was actually earning his keep. I finally convinced Rosemary that there was n't any need to hover outside the door. She could n't think of anywhere to go, so I suggested a museum. " Go to the De Young. You can walk around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Call every hour or so, and I 'll tell you how it 's going. " She went, but only because she could n't think of a good excuse for staying. It was a long day for all of us, probably longest for Ben. Steve Marley came out after about thirty minutes. " He 's a victim, I 'd bet on it. But I do n't know how long it 'll take to get him to admit it, " he said. I played waitress, taking in cider and doughnuts, sandwiches, and other munchies. Each time Ben looked tighter and more drawn. Rosemary called every half hour. My heart went out to both of them. Since Jesse was still in Sunnyvale, I 'd taken over his office just down the hall from mine. I still had plenty of work to catch up on, but I did n't get much done, and I 'd guess that Amy 's productivity was also near zero. Around eleven o'clock I got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is Lawrence Chilton of Pacific Rim. " Pacific Rim imports mechanized toys and other low-tech goodies from the Far East. Lawrence Chilton is its founder and president. He 'd hired me last year to find out how crates that contained highly sophisticated toy robots when they left Japan arrived in San Francisco full of cheap copies from Indonesia. " Yes, Mr. Chilton. What can I do for you? " " I 'm calling because I understand that you 've made some very serious allegations against a good friend of mine, Samuel Reiter. I 'm sure there must be some mistake here. " p124 It sure had n't taken long for word to get back to Reiter, and it had n't taken him long to counterattack. I could see the Old Boys circling up to protect their own. I wanted to ask Chilton if he had children and how he 'd feel about a man who befriended them and then demanded sex. Instead, I said in as neutral a tone as I could manage, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but I 'm sure you understand that I ca n't discuss a case with anyone other than my client. I owe him the same confidentiality that I promised you. " " Yes, of course, " he said. The irritation in his voice said, " Who the hell are you to defy me? " " I 'm glad you understand, " I said before he could tack on a " but. " " Let me assure you that I will conduct this investigation with the same integrity and discretion that I provided Pacific Rim. " " This does n't seem an appropriate kind of case for your agency, " Chilton said. " I doubt that I 'd have selected you as our investigator if I 'd known you were also involved in this sort of thing. " " That would certainly have been your right, just as it 's my right to decide which cases I choose to take. " I got two more calls before lunch. I gave them both the confidentiality speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it any better than he did. One, a bank vice-president, took the avuncular approach and warned me to beware of tales scoundrels tell. The other came very close to warning me that I 'd never work in this town again. My dad used to say that when you pull on a snake 's tail you 'd better watch out for the other end. This snake was proving to have sharp fangs and a long reach. I was surprised by Reiter 's reaction. I 'd known when I left Irene Lashman that there was a real danger she 'd call him, but I 'd assumed that he 'd want to keep my investigation a secret p125 and hope that none of the boys would talk. Instead, he 'd taken the offensive, recruiting his powerful friends to warn me off. It was an aggressive move. It made me wonder about how he would have responded to Mitch. The threats of influential businessmen would n't have been of any use there. Would he have ordered up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called his friends about me? And if so, would he try the same solution on me when he found out that threats had n't worked? A little after three, I was startled by a loud shout from my office. Ben was screaming at Steve. The words were muffled by the door but the fury behind them came through. The angry shouting was followed by sobbing, as loud as the shouts at first and slowly quieting down. After what seemed forever, Steve came out. He looked emotionally and physically exhausted. " Ask his mother to come back when she calls, " he said. " Ben could probably use something to drink. " I took Ben a Coke and some chocolate chip cookies. His face was streaked with tears, and he looked terribly young and vulnerable. He was clutching McGee on his lap and stroking him absentmindedly, a liberty that the big tom had never allowed an adult. Steve was planning to wait until Monday to talk to the Oakland police, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reiter 's friends he changed his mind. " Damn, I was afraid of that. It means we have to move fast, " he said. " There 's a good chance he 's already gotten rid of any evidence in his house. We have to hope he does n't realize that we 're ready to move. Guys like Reiter usually keep p126 mementos of their affairs -- photos, cards and letters from the boys, little presents -- stuff that helps us make the case and identify the other victims. We really want to get there before he disposes of that stuff. " " How fast can you move? " Marley looked at his watch. " Friday afternoon. Boy, I do n't know. Especially when we 're asking for a search warrant for the residence of a superior court judge. Let me make a couple of calls. " Marley got lucky ; an old friend in the Oakland PD agreed to wait for Rosemary and Ben to come down and file a report. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the warrant written up, but we can get one of them at home to sign it. There 'll be a lot of bitching about the screwed-up weekend, but we 'll get it done. " Steve went with Rosemary and Ben. He put an arm around the youngster and spoke gently and encouragingly to him. " I 'm going to tell you exactly what to expect over there, " he said as they headed out my door. " You 've already been through the worst part. " I picked Marley up at the BART station at eight-fifteen. The sigh he heaved as he settled into the seat spoke of more than fatigue. " They 're getting a warrant to search Reiter 's house. They wanted to do more investigation and line up a couple of more kids before they asked for the warrant, but I convinced them that we could n't wait, not now that he knows we 're after him. " Ben did great. He 's bouncing between guilt and anger. One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next he wants the cops to take Reiter out and shoot him. But he 's holding it together. And the guys on the case are good. They believe Ben. They 'll work hard to make a case. " We drove up Market Street. Homeless men and women were p127 settling into doorways and any other space that might offer a night 's uneasy sleep. The temperatures in San Francisco in April might not be cold by comparison to much of the rest of the country, but they were a long way from anything you 'd want to sleep in, if you had any choice. " When will they search his house? " I asked. " Tonight or tomorrow morning. I asked one of the guys to call me when they have the results. " " At least you 'll get a week of fishing in, " I said, feeling guilty that I 'd used up half of his vacation. " I 'm ready for that. " I dropped him at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case would be over. I was ready to go back to some nice, quiet corporate crime. I was also ready to give up my daily round of AA meetings. I 'd sat through at least a dozen of them, telling my story and listening to others, and all I 'd gotten from it was more opportunity for self-scrutiny and reflection than I found comfortable. I do n't know that I was drinking less, but I sure was n't enjoying it the way I used to. That seemed like a heavy price to pay for the possibility that I might find someone who might know something about a man who might have been murdered. p128 Molly had been adamant about her desire to sleep in Saturday morning, and I agreed to let her miss aikido in exchange for her promise that she 'd do something with me in the afternoon. She was living in my house, but I 'd been busy enough with work that we had n't had nearly enough time together. It made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should she not get what she needed from me. The aikido class went well. We had a couple of new women who were attending regularly and with growing enthusiasm. One was fifty and had gray hair and smile wrinkles, the other was fifteen. The fifty-year-old was feisty and exuberant, the fifteen-year-old, shy and retiring. They 'd adopted each other, and we all enjoyed watching their friendship develop. I wondered if the older woman ever felt awkward with her young friend the way I did so often with Molly. Molly was in the kitchen eating breakfast when I got home. She 'd made scrambled eggs, a welcome change from the junk food she ate in prodigious amounts. The counter was piled with p129 more dirty dishes than I would have dreamed you could use making such a simple dish. " Steve Marley called, " she said. " The number 's next to the phone. " The number was n't next to the phone. It was over by the sink. Molly could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the fifth ring. Background sounds suggested that the home improvement of the day involved some form of demolition. His voice was grim. " They 've done the search, and they got zip. He must have cleared out the house as soon as he heard that you were asking questions. " " Damn, " I said. " What does that do to the case? " " Makes it harder, of course, but not impossible. We still have Ben 's testimony, and the juvenile division will start tracing down every contact past and present. Sometimes you get a list of kids and acts and dates, and then it 's real easy. This way is harder. " " Do you think he destroyed all the evidence? " " I doubt it. Could you just burn up all your scrapbooks, old letters, and snapshots? And I 'd bet Reiter is much more attached to his mementos than you are to yours. We 're talking compulsion here. I 'd bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the type of thing you box up and ask your neighbor to store. Where would he put it? " " He could have an apartment somewhere, though Ben did n't mention one. Could have given it to another ped. Maybe he has a summer cabin. " " Or a boat, " I said, remembering Joe 's snapshot. " Did Ben say anything about a boat? " " No, but I can ask him. A man in Reiter 's position might well have a summer place and a boat. I 'll ask about both. " I made some fresh coffee and sat down at the table. " So what would you like to do this afternoon? " p130 She shrugged. " You do n't have to entertain me, you know. " " I was n't planning to. But I was looking forward to spending a few hours with you. How about the Museum of Modern Art? There 's a new photography exhibit there. Or we could go walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility seemed to enflame her with enthusiasm. I wondered what had happened to the cheerful little girl who was in love with the world a couple of years ago. The first horror writer to create body snatchers must have been the parent of a teenager. I made some more suggestions. She worked on perfecting her shrug. Finally, I said, " Let 's hold up a bank. " She looked surprised. At least she was listening. " Just check-ing, " I said. " How about we change sides? You make the suggestions and I 'll shrug for a while. " " I know you 're trying to help me, " she said, " but I 'm not into those things anymore. " " What are you into? " " Hanging out with my friends. " " So why do n't we invite your friends to go along? " " Catherine, " she said, in the tone I 'd used to say " Mother, " " my friends are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " Having met the friends, I was n't sure I wanted to know what they were into. A dish crashed to the floor just behind me. It was followed by a large, very guilty-looking cat who made a dash for the door. " Stone, " I yelled, and threw a paper at him. " Bad cat. " Touchstone can move remarkably fast for a grossly overweight animal. He was under the bed by the time I 'd finished swearing at him. I do n't believe you can train a cat, that 's part of why I like them so much. They have a bad attitude toward authority. With a cat, you learn to practice preventive behavior. With Touchstone, that means never leaving any form of food within his reach. It had taken two months to get Peter to accept that p131 dishes had to be rinsed before being abandoned on the counter. Now we had Molly. Molly who seemed to believe that dirty dishes magically cleaned themselves. When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gone to heaven. Molly was working hard to suppress a giggle. She was saved by the phone. I answered it. A voice I did n't recognize said, " Molly? " I gave her the phone and tried to decide whether I should leave the room. I settled for doing the dishes. " You can take it in my study if you want, " I said. " It 's okay, " she said, and took the phone. Eavesdropping is an occupational hazard. I did n't mean to do it ; it 's just an automatic reflex. " Uh, no, I ca n't, not today. I 'm supposed to do some stuff with my aunt.... Yeah, well, I 'll try.... Yeah, I 'll call you. " Not a lot of words, but the tone said, " Mental cruelty practiced here. " I was just finishing the dishes when the phone rang again. It was Marley with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Berkeley marina, and a cabin in Pinecrest. " I 'll get the Oakland PD to get warrants for both of those, " he said. " Maybe we 'll get lucky. " The morning had been cold and gray when I went to aikido, and it had progressed to a miserable thin mist. Just enough to make outdoor activity unpleasant, and not enough to help with the drought that had scorched the state for four years. We 'd had too many mornings like this. " Get your swimsuit, " I said. " What? " " Get your suit, your bathrobe, and a couple of towels. And dress warm. " " Where are we going? " she asked suspiciously. " You 'll see. " p132 The town of Calistoga is about an hour north of San Francisco, in the middle of some of the most beautiful grape country in the world and right on top of a bunch of hot springs. Sam Brannan, who 'd dreamed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saratoga, had built quite a resort there in the 1850s, but the scheme had drained his wealth and a nasty divorce had taken the rest of his assets and left Calistoga a sleepy little town, until a few years ago when the yup people discovered it. Back East, sitting in hot water may be regarded as a cure for what ails you. Californians take a more hedonistic approach. Hot springs in the middle of a valley full of wineries is pretty close to our idea of heaven. The drive itself is worth the trip. The upper Napa Valley is covered with neatly tended rows of wine grapes, interrupted occasionally by ancient volcanic cones that rise like treecovered islands from a sea of vineyards. Thickly wooded hills frame the valley to the west and their arid, starkly rocky cousins form its boundary to the east. Downtown Calistoga is four blocks long and lined with buildings old enough to be picturesque. I turned at the second block and took us to the Roman Spa Motel. I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the health business. The pools are surrounded by palm trees and flowers, and at night steam rises from the outdoor pools in great dramatic clouds. Molly had n't said much on the way up. She was looking at me as though I 'd completely lost my mind. " Come on, " I Said. " At the worst you 'll have a good story to tell your friends. " I bought day passes and we changed into our suits. The " cool " outdoor pool is somewhere around comfortable bath temperature. We started there, worked our way to the hotter indoor pool, and ended up in the small, very-hot pool under the palm trees. The lightest of rains brushed our faces, and even Molly could n't suppress a sigh of contentment. p133 I leaned back with the rain on my face and felt all the tension of the last couple of weeks drain away. When I 'd reached cooked-noodle status, I dragged myself out into the delicious coolness of the air. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked. " I 've never had a massage. " " Always a first time. " We put on robes and headed to the long, low building in back. They 'd redone the office since my last visit, gone upscale, but the girl at the desk still looked like it was 1968. " I can get you in, in about an hour, " she said. " Would you like a mud or an enzyme bath before the massage? We 're offering a special on them this weekend. " Immersing my body in hot mud, even healthy hot mud, has never particularly appealed to me, especially after a friend told me it felt like dying. That 's an experience I do n't pay money to have. " What 's the enzyme bath? " I asked. " It 's a Japanese practice, " she explained. " We put you in a tub with specially blended cedar fibers and plant enzymes. It 's very warm and relaxing, stimulates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " Molly said. I was going to pass on the shredded cedar, but Molly looked interested, so I signed us up. Fifteen minutes later we were climbing into large boxes of what looked like sawdust. I grumbled. Molly said, " Relax, at worst you 'll have a great story to tell Peter, or better yet, my mom. " The enzyme bath was a success before we ever got in it. It was relaxing and it smelled good. I do n't know what the enzymes did, but I had a short snooze and felt great when I climbed out. Getting all the little shreds of bark off my body would have been tedious as hell except that Molly developed a fit of the giggles, and we ended up clowning around and laughing like a couple of ten-year-olds. After the massage, we had an early dinner at a little restaurant p134 that reminded me that yuppification is not all bad. It does improve the quality of the food and wine. Molly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kid, but she tried some duck sausages that were absolutely exotic for her. Sunset comes early in the valley, so much of our ride home was in fading light, but nothing could dampen our spirits. We were both a bit euphoric -- lots of " Look, there 's a hawk on the fence " and " Jeeze, that 's beautiful. " I wondered why she 'd locked that side of herself away for so long. In Marin, where houses had replaced the open country, she said, " You know, that really was fun. Mom never does anything for fun. " " Maybe her idea of fun is different, " I said. Marion 's idea of fun had always been different from mine. " I guess, " Molly said. " You 're different people. You like different things. " " Yeah, well, I just wish she 'd stop trying to make me into something I do n't want to be. She does n't know who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wants me to be just like her. And when I 'm not, I 'm wrong. " I remember saying something similar to my mother. I also remember her sighing and telling me it was n't so easy being a parent. " She treats me like a baby, for chrissake, " Molly complained. " For all those years before Leonard came along, I was her big girl. ' I was mature enough to be home alone, to fix dinner for myself, to listen to her troubles. Now that I 'm really old enough to take care of myself, she 's decided that I 'm still a child. ' " I remembered how Marion had praised Molly 's independence and maturity when she was younger. Molly had had to be mature. There was n't much choice. Her daddy took a hike when she was six years old, and Marion was ill equipped to be on her own. There were times when Molly had seemed more responsible than her mother. She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mommy 's little girl " now that Marion was ready to take charge. " You 're pretty grown-up, all right, " I said, " but it 's a scary world out there. I would n't like to think of you having to face it all alone. " " I know kids who do. " " I know you do, " I said, " but it seems to me that no one cares enough about those kids to want to protect them. They have lots of freedom, but I do n't know that they have much else. " Molly was silent for a while. I did n't know whether she was thinking about what I 'd said or had dismissed me as a creature from the Dark Ages. I did know that teenagers do not say, " You 're right. " p136 The red light on my answering machine blinked to tell me I had a call. Steve Marley 's voice on the tape sounded excited. " Call me when you get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " I think we got a live one here, " he said. " The sailboat is n't at the Berkeley Marina. Reiter 's slip is empty. He claims a friend is sailing the boat to Mexico, but I 've got a hunch it 's closer than that. " " Are the police checking the local marinas? " " I do n't know. It may take them a while to get around to it. " " I 'll give them a little help, " I said. " Give me a description of the boat. " " It 's a thirty-foot Catalina sloop, white. The name is the Jolly Roger, California registration number 360964. " Tracing boats is n't my specialty, but I 'd done it once before as part of another case, so I had a starting point. My starting point was Larry Davis, the harbor master at Oyster Point. I called him first thing Monday morning. Larry remembered me. " You 're the gorgeous creature who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and destroyed my self-esteem forever, " he said. " I prefer to think of it as saving you from being decapitated by your lovely-but-jealous wife, " I replied. " How 's my favorite sex maniac? " " Better for hearing from you. When you coming down, so I can chase you around the desk? " " As soon as I get a new pair of running shoes. In the meantime, I need some help. " I explained my problem to him. " So if you had a thirty-foot Catalina you did n't want found, where would you put it that would still be within an hour or two of Oakland? " " Well, not one of the bigger marinas. We check registration and all that stuff pretty carefully. I 'd go to an older, private marina, one where they want your money badly enough not to ask too many questions. " " And where would you find such a place? " " There 's one or two on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sacramento River to someplace in the delta. There 's plenty of private places up there. I might scrape the registration numbers off my boat, maybe even the name, but unless there was time to repaint the sucker, you 'd probably still be able to read them from where the paint faded. " " Is there a directory with the names and phone numbers of those places? " " I do n't know of one offhand, but I have a bunch of numbers here. You planning on calling marinas? " " That was the plan, " I said. " I do n't know how much luck you 'll have. We harbor masters do n't just give out information, especially not on paying customers. " " Actually, I was going to identify myself as your new assistant. " He laughed. " The day I make enough to hire an assistant, I 'll be too old to enjoy the interviews. " p138 It was my turn to laugh. " So how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing boat is in their marina? " I asked. " You can tell them you 're a friend of mine, that might help. But the truth is never as much fun as a good fib. Why do n't you tell them that the owner of the boat stiffed me for fees and you 're helping me find him. " " Sounds good to me, " I said. " Thanks, I really appreciate it. " " Think nothing of it. I 'm planning on calling you the next time some guy really does stiff me. " I could n't see asking Larry to read me all the telephone numbers he had over the phone. Jesse would have suggested that he fax them, but I knew Larry. He probably did n't own a microwave ; he definitely would n't have a fax. It 's my belief that almost anything you want to know can be found in some book, and the real challenge is finding that book. A call to Rand McNally confirmed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private, on the West Coast, and they had one copy in stock. I sent Amy for the book, and asked Chris to come give me an update on what was happening with Jesse 's undercover job. " This is taking longer than it should. What 's going on? " I asked. " We think something spooked them, " she said. " Jesse 's playing it extra careful, that 's why he has n't come in since last week. He 's coming up tonight to see Claire, so he 'll stop by here sometime after six. He was hoping to meet with you then. " " I 'll be here, " I said. " Do you need anything from me on this case? " She shook her head. " We just need these folks to make a move. " " Well, when that happens, let me know. It makes me nervous to be sitting this one out. " p139 Chris handles Amy 's desk when she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wants information, she 's just slightly more pleasant than Leona Helmsley as a receptionist. " There 's a Kevin Doyle here to see you. He says he 's a reporter. He does not have an appointment, " she announced. The tone of her voice was only a few degrees above freezing. I figured that the poor guy would never get up the courage to come back, so I told her to send him in. Kevin Doyle had more freckles than I can remember seeing on a grown man. He was covered with them -- face, arms, hands. I do n't know about anywhere else, but I 'd bet they were there, too. His hair was red and sort of curly, and he had a Tom Sawyer grin. His parents obviously had n't believed that boys needed their teeth straightened, so his upper jaw looked like it had too many teeth competing for too little room. Instead of detracting from his appearance, the crooked teeth came across as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to late twenties. He was surprisingly well dressed for a newspaperman. His pants had a single crease down each leg instead of the spider web or wrinkles that my friend Max Siedman manages to impress on every pair of slacks he owns. His shirt was actually tucked in all the way around. He handed me his press credentials and explained that he was a reporter for the Chronicle on special assignment. " That means they put me on a slightly longer leash, " he confided. " I 'm doing a series on child abuse, and I 've gotten interested in pedophiles. The stereotype is that these are guys in dirty raincoats who lurk around bus stations, but they 're often highly respected members of the community. But then you know that, " he said with a knowing look. What I know is never to tell a reporter anything you do n't want to see in print. I kept my expression neutral. Doyle was undeterred. " I understand that the juvenile sex- p140 crimes unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said. " And I understand that you had something to do with it. " " Mr. Doyle, " I said, " I never comment on my cases to anyone outside my office, especially not to reporters. " He waited for me to say more. I did n't. He just kept sitting there looking at me expectantly. He was waiting for me to get uncomfortable with the silence, so I 'd say something to fill it. I use that maneuver all the time. I did n't appreciate being on the receiving end. I stood up and extended my hand to signal that the interview was over. " I 'm sorry that I ca n't help you. I 'll look forward to reading your articles. " He remained seated. I remained standing. " Ms. Sayler, from what I hear, you care deeply about abuse of this kind. Surely you wo n't just turn your back and let this man get away with his crime. " " I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases with reporters. " He shrugged his shoulders, gave me an engaging **25;0;TOOLONG grin, and finally got up to go. At the door, he stopped and took out a business card. " If you change your mind, or you know someone who wants to make sure that the truth gets told, please give me a call. " I had the feeling as he left that I was n't going to get rid of Kevin Doyle that easily. It had taken less than forty-eight hours for him to learn about the search warrant. I expected that rumors must be flying around the courthouse, but I also knew that only the insiders would hear them. Kevin Doyle had excellent sources someplace. There were more marinas in the Bay Area than I 'd guessed, especially when you included the ones in the Sacramento River delta. I spent so much time on the phone that my ear hurt, and p141 I began to fear that the telephone would grow onto the side of my head. It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all. Most were friendly and cooperative when I mentioned Larry 's name, but none of them had seen the Jolly Roger. Several harbor masters at smaller, private facilities did n't know Larry and would n't talk to me. I could drive to each of those marinas, or I could take the easy way out. I could send Chris. She 'd prefer being out of the office to going over Anton Glosser 's financial records, and she 'd actually enjoy flirting with strange men and getting them to tell her things. I got tired of that one a long time ago. I asked her to bring me the Glosser file and catch me up on what she 'd found. " Hard to say yet, " she said. " Most of what I 've found looks pretty clean, but there are a couple of things to raise questions about. They have to do with some limited partnerships where Glosser 's listed as one of the general partners. Two of these partnerships have ownership structures that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned by Y and Z, who are owned by A, B, and C, who are owned by... " She shrugged. " When things get that complicated, you have to wonder why. " The other partnerships look solid -- property management, real estate, a couple of small electronics ventures, that sort of thing. Ownership 's pretty straightforward. I 've checked on the other general partners, and they 're just who you 'd expect -- a couple of relatives, his wife, and the major investors in his company. There 's only one guy who does n't fit, a Milton Diesman. " She shuffled through the file, and pulled out a sheet of paper. " Diesman is himself the general partner in a long list of limited partnerships, many of which are obviously real estate deals. I have n't had a chance to check on them, but one name was familiar -- Sunnyside Properties. Ring any bells? " " More like sirens, " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks we nailed in a pro bono case just after you p142 came on staff almost three years ago. Remember the Tenderloin SRO hotel where the owner cut off the heat in December? That was owned by Sunnyside. They 're slumlords. " She gave a low whistle. " You mean our boy 's a slumlord? " " His friend Diesman could be. It 's worth checking on Sunnyside and Diesman. " " I have one more thing for you, " Chris said. I waited while she pulled out another paper. " I checked the newspaper file on Dialogue. Two references to Glosser in the Chronicle in the last six months. He was elected president of the German-American Association, and he 's involved in trying to put together some kind of trading deal with Germany. He 's been working with the State Department, might be headed into politics. " " Really, " I said. " A place where the appearance of propriety is required, at least in order to get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answering machine. When I picked up my messages, her voice informed me that she was going to " hang out " with some of her friends and would be back that evening. I wondered about the friends. Were they the vampire twins or someone from school? And what exactly did hang out mean to kids in the nineties? I was beginning to feel real empathy for Marion. Jesse got there about six-fifteen. He was wearing a black T-shirt and jeans, and he 'd gotten a haircut that made him look very hip and about nineteen years old. " Is this the International Harvester look? " I asked. " You like it? I wanted to catch people 's attention, maybe speed things up a bit. Claire hates it. " " You look like someone I 'd cross the street to avoid, " I said. That 's a compliment in our business. We went over what was happening down in Sunnyvale. The p143 answer was not much. " I been making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running me into the poorhouse. And I know they checked out my room over a week ago, so I do n't know what 's holding them up. " " Any chance they 've made you? " " Nah. I do n't think so. It just does n't feel like that. The guys I figure as contacts, they 're still real friendly, and they 're still dropping hints that maybe they know how a bright, not-too-straight guy could make some real money. " " Just be careful. Maybe I should be running backup. I think things are about to come together up here, at least on part of the case. " Jesse shook his head. " Sometimes it 's more dangerous to have backup than to go it alone. " I knew he was right. When you 're working alone, you only have to worry about not screwing up ; add another person and you have to worry about them, too. " So tell me about Anton Glosser. That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said. " Nothing yet. Chris has found enough to make me think I might find something if I dig deeper. Peter 's talked with an attorney who thinks that Maureen Merrick may have cause to sue the county for negligence. I 'd rather see her get the money out of Glosser. " " Where does this thirst for vengeance come from? I thought you did n't believe in that sort of thing. How does that square with your aikido? " " Aikido is about experiencing the consequences of your actions. You try to hit me, you end up on the floor. Glosser took an action when he double-crossed Orrin Merrick. I just want him to experience the consequences. " " No turning the other cheek, huh? " " Not when it encourages a man like Glosser to hit the next poor soul who irritates him. " p144 I awoke Tuesday morning to the sound of rain. Four years of drought have sharpened our appreciation of what used to be regarded as a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for celebration. On barren hillsides in Marin, New Agers perform rain rituals, and I have friends who refuse to carry umbrellas out of the superstitious belief that their lack of protection will somehow hasten a downpour. Molly seemed unusually cheerful at breakfast, and even Peter managed a minimal effort at conversation. Stone took the rain as a sign that he 'd better store up more fat for winter, and made a nuisance of himself until I dumped him out the back door. He took one look at the puddles in the backyard and dashed between my legs back into the kitchen. Stone believes that water should be confined to bowls and toilets. I took my umbrella to the office, just to be ornery and because I find the rain a whole lot more pleasant when it 's not dripping down my neck. Larry Davis called around ten. " A friend of mine, Charlie Milkin, from up the delta, called. He 'd lost your number, but he thinks he 's found your boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was driving over to his cousin 's yesterday and went by a place upriver used to be owned by a family with two boats. Present owners just have a small motor boat, and the second slip is usually empty. Only right now it has a pretty little Catalina sloop there. Charlie went over to take a closer look, and the name 's gone, but you can still see where the paint 's faded around the letters. It 's the Jolly Roger, all right. " " Larry, you 're a prince. I 'll take you and your lovely wife to dinner the next time I 'm down your way. What 's Charlie 's number? " " Pam 's on a diet, but I know a great place with candlelight and soft music. " " Dinner, Larry, no dessert. Now, what 's the number? " Charlie Milkin was delighted to help. He told me all about the last guy who 'd slipped out without paying for repairs. " Guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rubber ball. But he 'd been talking about going to San Luis, and I got friends down there. They called the cops. Turned out this guy owed marinas up and down the coast. He 'd even used fake papers to get the loan to buy the boat. He 'll be making license plates for a while. " Charlie gave me directions to the boat and promised not to let anyone know we were onto it. I passed the information to Steve Marley. He tipped the cops in Oakland. He asked if I 'd like him to tag along on the search. I figured that meant he was anxious to escape cleaning out closets at home, so I said yes. I did n't get a lot of work done during the next several hours. My attention kept straying to the phone. We must have gotten a dozen calls before the one I was waiting for. p146 Steve Marley 's voice was jubilant. " We found it, " he announced. " Boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at the station, but just the stuff from the first box would be enough for an indictment. There 's a diary. Reiter was into flowery descriptions of his affairs. His own writing 'll be enough to convict him. And the diary seems to have some kids ' names, so tracing recent victims wo n't be that hard. " " Did you tell them to look for anything that might tie him to Mitch 's death? " " I did, and they 'll contact homicide if anything at all shows up. I should think that Judge Samuel Reiter is only a few hours away from being arrested. " Joe was not as excited by my news as I 'd expected. He gave a long sigh and said, " So it 's finally over. " I hated to tell him that it was n't anywhere near over. Reiter would probably plea-bargain, but he was a public figure and the media were bound to make a circus out of the whole thing. " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " I said. " That is, unless they find something linking Reiter to Mitch 's murder. It sounds like they have more than enough to make the child-molestation charges. " I hate to admit it, but I 'm just a bit superstitious. A part of me believes in omens and runs of luck. When things are going, my way, I buy a lottery ticket. When they 're not, I 'm especially careful in crossing the street. Today I bought a lottery ticket on my way to another AA meeting. The lottery ticket was n't a winner, but the meeting made up for that. It was led by a short, dark-haired man with a pockmarked face who introduced himself as Mel R. I closed my eyes and p147 listened to his voice to see if it matched the one on Mitch 's phone tape. I could n't be sure. The topic of Mel 's talk was transcending the past. As he related how his uncle had gotten him drunk to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew I 'd found Mitch 's sponsor. Who else but a former victim could have served Mitch in that role, and who better than the quiet self-assured man who was leading today 's meeting? Mel finished his talk with a plea to let go of past wrongs. " The past is a great excuse when you 're looking for a reason to drink, " he said. " But you have to let it go. Living in the present is hard enough without carrying the burdens of the past along, too. " When he asked for questions or comments, I ran through the speech I 'd made at earlier AA meetings. I tried to change it each time, since I 'd seen some of the same people at several meetings, but I did n't have to change it a lot. This was a group that understood that problems do n't go away fast and some wounds need a lot of telling to be cleansed. After the meeting, Mel R. came up to me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said. " You have to go on. " " I feel so guilty, " I said. " All that does n't matter. You have to put it behind you. " His voice was warm but authoritative ; he was just the kind of person I could see a man like Mitch turning to for help. " You ca n't let the past become an excuse for taking the next drink, " he continued. " A drunk can always find an excuse. " " I feel like if I could just? " A tiny, almost elfin man in his fifties broke in. " I 'm sorry to interrupt, but I need to talk to Mel, " he said. " It 's really an emergency. " Mel let himself be led aside, and was immediately drawn into an intense interchange that did n't look as if it 'd be over soon. After more than a week of searching for Mel, it was all I could do not to grab him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my dwindling reserves of self-control, I took my p148 sorrows to the coffee table, and hung around trying to resist the urge to reach for one of the doughnuts. A young woman wearing more makeup than she needed drew me into conversation, and in the moments that my attention was distracted, Mel disappeared. I tore outside, then back in to check for other exits. I 'd lost him. I knew where to find him again, but I 'd have to wait a week to do it. Just barely managing not to swear out loud, I took a doughtnut to soothe the frustration and headed for home. The judge 's arrest was n't on the six o'clock news, but it made the ten o'clock broadcast. The police had managed the arrest without alerting the media, so Reiter was spared having television cameras pushed in his face while he was being led from his home. This would be the last time he was granted that little bit of dignity. The reporters had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. They 'd dredged up some old footage of the Good Citizen for Youth Award and made a big thing out of the irony of the situation, making Youth Services and a lot of other valuable organizations look foolish. I fervently hoped they would n't go around to the chess and computer clubs and harass the already-confused boys there. " You look pretty glum for someone who just won, " Molly said. I felt pretty glum. " I 'm glad they caught him, " I said. " I 'm just sad for all the kids and their families that were betrayed by him. " " But are n't they better off with the judge out of the way? " she asked. " Sure they are, but it 's like having someone tell you that you need a tooth pulled. It 's a good thing to find out before it does any more damage, but it still hurts like hell. " Molly nodded, but I doubted that she really understood. One of the virtues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms p149 of doing good, instead of worrying about not causing too much harm. Reiter 's arrest made the front page of the Chronicle the next morning. The byline was Kevin Doyle 's. He 'd done a good job with the story. I had to give him credit for that. He 'd hit all the sources I had, and had quotes from most of them, and he had n't gone for the cheap shots. He 'd made an effort to portray Samuel Reiter as a complex man instead of a monster, and he 'd tried to provide some information on pedophilia. It was n't anything the Man-Boy Love Association would like, but it seemed fair to me. I went to the office ready to get back to business as usual. Kevin Doyle was waiting there when I arrived. " Nice work, " he said. " And to you. I liked your article in the Chron. " He followed me into my office without being asked. " So will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No? Why not? Reiter 's under arrest. " " I never talk about my cases with the press. That has n't changed, " I said. " Okay, " Doyle said, giving up much too easily. " How about your client? You must have a client who asked you to look into Reiter. Would your client talk to me? " I did n't know. It occurred to me that Joe might very much like to talk with Kevin. It would provide an opportunity to get some publicity about Mitch 's murder, and there was always a chance that that might lead to something. " Give me your card again. I 'll contact my client, and if he or she is interested in talking with you, they 'll call you, " I said. Kevin grinned and handed me a card. " The number on the back is my home phone. Call anytime, " he said. p150 Joe had seen Kevin 's article, and after considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just be sure that you do n't tell him anything you would n't want to see in print, " I said. " There is no such thing as off the record. ' " I spent the morning putting together a final report on the Reiter case, getting Steve Marley 's hours, so I could cut him a check, and dealing with loose ends. At eleven a new loose end popped up. Carol Bailey from Oakland called. " I think I 've found your victim 's car, " she said. " It 's on Felman in the three-hundred block. I got the tip from a gal I busted who finds herself in need of bail money. I have n't checked to confirm it, but I think the tip 's good. " " Felman Street? Is that anywhere near Jerry 's Bar? " " No, that 's the funny part. It 's in the warehouse district above Jack London Square. That 's a completely different section of town. " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car on the way to someplace else, certainly not on the way to Jerry 's. I felt the surge of adrenaline that kicks in when a case starts to come together. Joe was excited by the discovery of the car. It took him only fifteen minutes to clear his calendar so he could go along with me. On the drive to Oakland, he became more somber. " Does this mean Mitch was murdered by Reiter? " he asked. " I do n't know. Can you think of any reason his car would be in the warehouse district in Oakland? " He shook his head. " I 'm sure there are explanations, but until we find one it makes Mitch 's death look all the more suspicious. That 's for sure. " " It 's funny, " he said. " I hired you to prove that it was n't a random killing, and now that we 're almost there, I wish it was. " I kept my gaze on the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel the intensity that I knew burned in his eyes. " If it had been a robbery, I would n't be responsible. It would n't matter that I did n't help him. " " Do n't beat yourself up, " I said. " You do n't know that it 'd been any different if you had helped him. " I thought of Mel R. 's comment that " living in the present is hard enough without carrying the burdens of the past along, too. " Easier to say than do. Jack London Square is Oakland 's Fisherman 's Wharf without the fishermen. It 's on an estuary of the San Francisco Bay and most of the waterfront property is devoted to restaurants. Inland from the restaurants and cutesy shops is the warehouse district. The businesslike old brick buildings are still in good repair, and the area is slowly being revitalized as new businesses move in. Mitch Morrison 's old Ford Pinto waited on a street that was on its way up. A couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into office space. The rest were still solid blue-collar structures. Mitch 's car was a black Pinto that was probably no stranger to the want ads. It had a dent in one fender and one tire had gone flat. It was still there because it looked too poor to rob and just respectable enough not to be towed. The car was locked, but Joe had found an extra set of keys at Mitch 's apartment. Inside, the car looked messy, a familiar kind of messy, the kind you generate doing surveillance. There were plastic cups and fast-food containers, a half-empty sack of stale pretzels, a partially eaten bagel, a couple of dirty napkins. I wore plastic gloves to search, and tried not to move things around too much in order not to compromise the police search. A copy of a newpaper added to the clutter. I checked the date. It was an afternoon paper from the day Mitch. died. I found a p152 flashlight, a camera, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitch had used his car to watch someone or something. The scraps of paper were mainly food wrappers, but in the space between the driver 's seat and the gearshift, I found a piece of notebook paper folded into fourths. On it, JONAH T was printed in block letters, and beneath the name was the number 4736682. " That 's Mitch 's handwriting, " Joe said. " But he never mentioned a Jonah to me. " " What do you make of the number? " " It 's pretty long. Could be a serial number or the number of a case file or something like that. " It could be damn near anything, I thought. I counted the digits. Seven. It could be a telephone number. We found another sheet from the same notebook in the glove compartment. Written on it in the same block printing was the name " Reiter, " an address which I recognized as his, and a telephone number that was probably his as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side of the paper. I copied down the information on both sheets of paper and replaced them where I 'd found them. They were the only thing in the car that seemed promising. Maybe the cops would have more luck, but I doubted it. I sent Joe back to San Francisco on BART. The location of the car and its contents were the closest we 'd come to finding a clue to what happened the night of Mitch 's death, and I wanted to learn what I could before the police arrived to start questioning people. In my experience, uniforms and badges tend to produce severe memory loss in susceptible individuals. I did n't think it was an accident that Mitch had left the car in this neighborhood. He must have been here for a reason. I had my snapshot of the murdered man and a photo of Samuel p153 Reiter. Now all I needed was someone who 'd seen either one or both of them. In a three-block radius of the car, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been Mitch Morrison. Only one of them seemed sober enough to remember something that happened yesterday, let alone a month ago. That was a woman who worked in a small cafe a couple of blocks from where the car was parked. " Yeah, I remember that scar on his hand, " she said. " Remember wondering how he got it. He came in here asking about something, I think. " " Do you remember what he asked about? " " No. " She shook her head, then stopped, " Yeah, yeah, it was about a car, I think. Yeah, he wanted to know if I 'd seen this car. " " What kind of car? " She shrugged. " I do n't remember, but I think it was an expensive car -- you know, fancy. I had n't seen it around here. " I gave her a business card with a fictitious name on it and the agency 's unlisted phone number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the man. I always feel a bit paranoid using fake cards, but there are times when I prefer not to give my own name and number, especially when I 'm looking for a killer. I headed back to my car and was almost mowed down by a tall, thin young man carrying a large cardboard box. He backed out of a doorway and straight into me. " Oh, shit, I 'm sorry, " he said. " Are you okay? " " I 'm okay, " I said. " Do you work around here? " " Huh? Yeah, sometimes. " He was probably in his late twenties and had a dark red patch shaped like a strawberry just above the jawline, on the left side of his face. I showed him the picture of Mitch and asked if he 'd seen him in the neighborhood several weeks ago. " This guy? Why do you want to know? " p154 " He left his car near here, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he was doing here. " " Oh, sure, " he said and studied the picture again. " Yeah, I think I seen this guy, but almost a month ago. Is there a reward or something? And who 're you? " " I 'm working for the family, and there is a reward for anyone who has real information. Did you talk to him? " " Yeah, I did. But I do n't remember exactly what about. How much reward? " he asked slyly. " Depends on the information. Did he ask you about a car? " " Yeah. " He nodded. " Yeah, that 's what we talked about, a car. He was looking for a car, but I had n't seen it. " " What kind of car was he looking for? " He shrugged. " I do n't remember. I guess that 's not good enough for a reward, huh? But I 'll tell you what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone number, and if I find out anything I 'll call you. " I pulled out a card and realized as I handed it to him that it was the wrong one. I 'd given him a regular business card with my name and the agency address and phone number on it. A seven-digit number can mean just about anything, but the easiest seven digits to check on are a phone number, so when I got back to the office I dialed the number I 'd found in Mitch 's car. I got a recording telling me that the service was either turned off for the number I was trying to reach or it was out of my service area. I 've gotten that message before. It means you 've reached a cellular phone. Jonah T. 's cellular phone? I hoped so. The only problem now was that cellular phone numbers are unlisted and damn near impossible to get ahold of unless you have a court order or know someone at the phone company willing to risk their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source at the phone company, but not that good a source. p155 I called Inspector Warren at the Oakland PD, and told him about the car and the papers I 'd found in it. He was not impressed by my skill at figuring out that the mysterious seven digits might be a telephone number, but he did agree to get the information on the number from the phone company. I restrained myself from suggesting he do it sometime before the end of the decade. Time to draw on another brilliant investigative technique. I 'd have to call the number until I got someone on the other end. I could do that while I was n't figuring out how to nail Anton Glosser. Jesse called in just before five. " It 's set to go down Friday night. You want in? " " Tell me about it, " I said. " I 'm to leave the side door open and make sure that the boxes are stacked against the wall just down from the loading dock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I make sure the right stock gets in the right place. Then I go home, and they pick up the merchandise. " " Have you tipped the cops? " " Yep. A couple of them will come in tonight and mark all the stock on the wish list and put transmitters in the boxes. Tomorrow I just follow instructions so everything 's right where the gang expects to find it. The cops 'll take it from there. " " They 're going to wait to make the bust, I hope. We want the person who ordered the theft, not the thugs who 're carrying it out. Try to make sure they do n't move before the delivery. " " I 've already cleared that, " Jesse said. " They want the big boys behind this as much as we do. They 'll just watch the stolen parts till they get where they 're going. " " In the meantime, you 'll have to stay on the job, " I said. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Believe me, I hope they move quickly. You want to be involved in this in any way? " p156 Part of me wanted to talk to the cops in Sunnyvale, to go back over the operation. Any screwup on their part could blow all of Jesse 's hard work and, worse yet, put his life in jeopardy, but I remembered how I 'd felt the first time my former boss, Keith Stone, had let me run an entire operation. " It 's your show, " I told him. " I 'd just be in the way. Just let me know how things are going. " " Will do, " he said, and I could hear the smile in his voice. p157 The next couple of days held few surprises. Samuel Reiter was released on bail. His cronies who had been so quick to threaten me did not call to apologize. The police found nothing in Mitch 's car to whet their curiosity. And the secret of Anton Glosser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunnyvale was robbed on schedule, and the gang was greedy and careless enough to move the loot straight to the competitor 's warehouse. The police had rounded up the gang, though there was still some question as to whether they 'd gotten the leader. They 'd arrested one highly placed executive in the competing firm, but they were looking for a bigger fish. Our client had what he wanted, and Jesse was so pleased that he had a hell of a time maintaining his pose as Mr. Cool. It was good to have him back in the office. Friday morning 's Chronicle carried a follow-up story on Judge Samuel Reiter 's arrest, again with a byline by Kevin Doyle. The reporter devoted a good deal of space to the suspicious circumstances of Mitch Morrison 's violent death. He inserted the word alleged at all the right spots, and stayed on p158 the safe side of the libel laws, but he managed to make the connection between Mitch 's death and his investigation of Reiter look a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did us another big favor. He included in the story a request that anyone knowing anything about Mitch 's activities during his last days contact Doyle at the Chron. We had been unable to locate anyone who knew much about what Mitch was up to, yet I felt sure that there must be people who did. Maybe one of them would see the article and call. Steve Marley telephoned as I was going over Jesse 's report on the Sunnyvale case. " I 'm going over to Oakland to take another look at the stuff from Reiter 's boat. You want to come along? " Did I want to look through a pedophile 's private souvenir collection? Not hardly. But there was the chance that something in those boxes might provide a clue to Mitch 's death, so I tried to sound grateful as I thanked him. Steve 's buddy from the Juvenile Division looked as if he wished I 'd stayed home, but he found us a room where we would n't be interrupted. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a dirty window that looked out on the freeway. He fussed a bit and delivered a set of instructions that translated as " Do n't let the civilian screw anything up " ; then he and Steve went to claim the boxes that would send Samuel Reiter to jail. The four boxes they lugged in were only part of the total haul from the boat. Steve 's buddy dropped his boxes on the table and announced, " They 're all yours. Just check them back in when you 're through, " and hurried out of the room. Steve put three of the cardboard boxes on the floor, sat the fourth on the table between us and began to sort through it. There were hundreds of snapshots, all of boys. He dropped a pile in front of me. " Let 's see how good you are at this kind of thing. What do these tell you? " p159 I picked up a handful and looked through them, then laid them out on the table in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind parents carry in their wallets ; but in most the boys were naked. Some struck provocative poses ; others tried to look casual, as if there was nothing out of the ordinary about their nudity. When you looked at them all together, certain similarities emerged. The boys were all about the same age, somewhere between nine and eleven. Their body types were similar -- on the small side with little bony chests. All were white, and most were towheads with a sprinkling of freckles across their noses, the kind of kid Norman Rockwell loved to paint. There were a number of redheads and several dark-eyed Latin types, but the majority were strikingly similar. I picked up a picture of a strawberry blond, freckle-faced youngster who was wearing only a Mickey Mouse T-shirt. He stood with one foot on a tree stump and offered an uncertain, crooked-toothed smile for the camera. He was the kid down the block, the upstart in the fourth grade, Tom Sawyer in the school play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish or a baseball bat, not posing for Samuel Reiter 's private collection. " He likes boys between nine and eleven, white, average build, and prefers blonds with freckles, " I said. I looked away from the faces and was struck by the vulnerability of the skinny legs and knobby knees, liberally decorated with the scrapes and scabs that are the badges of boyhood adventures. " Yep, " Marley said. " But you missed the backgrounds. Most were taken in the woods or on a sailboat. We 'll check the interior shots ; they 're probably from his house. " He was holding a notebook he 'd pulled from the box. " One of Reiter 's journals, " he said. " You might find it interesting. " Reiter wrote in a spidery, cramped hand, but it was fairly easy to decipher. The first entry described a boy who 'd just joined his soccer team. The writing was flowery, like something p160 from a cheap romantic novel. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's infatuation with the boy was apparent. I flipped to a later page and found an entry with a different tone. I often wonder if things would have been different if I had n't met Craig. What if I 'd played Little League instead of joining the Boy Scouts? Or what if I 'd joined another troop? Would I feel this attraction to boys if Craig had n't introduced me to it? The " experts " would place the blame on him, but what do they really know? Do they know why he chose me, instead of someone else? Did he see something, know something about me that even I did n't realize? I showed the journal to Steve. " Reiter was a victim, too, " I said. Steve read the page and nodded. " You 'd be surprised how many times I 've read passages just like that. I told you that these guys were former victims. In fact, a lot of what we know about peds comes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and I read on as he sorted through the contents of several boxes. Pages of selfdenunciation and loathing alternated with pathetic, self-serving efforts at justification. At times, Reiter clearly saw the damage he was doing to his " loves " and swore he 'd stop, but subsequent passages revealed that not only had he been unable to quit, but he was busy planning the seduction of a new boy. I followed his infatuation with a boy named Brad who was the son of his law clerk. He described in loving detail conversations and outings, the exchange of confidences and other signs of growing trust and intimacy. There were pages of descriptions of how Brad combed his hair, his casual gestures and favorite expressions, the way he sat or stood or ran. That was the touching, almost sweet, part. There were also p161 sections so explicit and prurient as to be pornographic. I skipped those. Toward the end of the journal I came across an entry that caught my attention. Spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were so worldly, so unabashed in their sexuality. I was both fascinated and repelled. K. is my dark side. He is the most completely amoral man I have ever known. I ca n't imagine him tormenting himself with guilt and remorse the way I do. I do n't trust him, do n't even like him, yet I am drawn back to him like a moth to a flame. " What do you make of this? " I asked Steve. He read it, then handed back the book. " A buddy. It 's not unusual. These guys find each other. They 'll trade pictures, write to each other about their affairs. Sometimes they even pass kids along. When a kid gets too old for one guy, he gets introduced to a buddy who likes older kids. " We spent several hours, and I skimmed through a couple of diaries, but I found nothing that told me whether Samuel Reiter had played any role in Mitch Morrison 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have faced another page of Reiter 's private obsessions. That evening Molly wanted to go to a party, but when I asked whose parents would be there, she just laughed. " Parents do n't hang around parties, " she informed me. " Even in Palo Alto, lots of times they go out for the evening. " " And leave a house full of fourteen-year-olds on their own? " " Lots of the kids at this party are older. " That 's when I realized that interrogation skills might be useful in raising a teenager. It took a lot more questions, most met p162 with evasive answers, to discover that the party was being given by the vampire twins. Molly was indignant when I said no. I tried to explain the dangers of the streets. She was unimpressed. " Goll, " she said, and rolled her eyes, " you 'd think I was a baby. You 're so paranoid, Catherine. Not every person out there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are cool, like that guy across the street who gave us a ride down to Polk Street yesterday afternoon. " I should have asked, " What guy? " Should have wondered why a stranger would walk up and talk to three girls coming out of my house on a Thursday afternoon. But I was so busy trying to explain the general dangers of urban America that I missed completely a very specific one much closer to home. The weekend was a disaster. Molly was furious that I had n't let her go to the party, and the fragile relationship that we 'd begun to build when she first arrived had eroded as I spent long hours at the office. She went off with the vampire twins both days and came back spoiling for a fight. Even fairly innocuous requests that she turn down her music or rinse her dishes were met with angry tirades or sullen sulks. I felt like I was living in the middle of a minefield. Peter was as tired of his role as peacemaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found more reasons to be away from home. I missed him and was silently furious for his defection. By Monday morning I was ready to send Molly back to Marion. I 'd decided that they deserved each other. I did n't delude myself that sending Molly home would solve her problems, but it would mean that one less person would be miserable, and since that person was me, it seemed like a good plan. I was figuring out how to effect the reunion of mother and daughter when Arthur Costa called. I know Arthur only indi- p163 rectly ; Peter 's worked for him and has some very entertaining stories about Costa 's courtroom antics. He is a highly respected, somewhat eccentric, defense lawyer who has won more than his share of lost causes. " Ms. Sayler, I 'm representing Joe Girard, " he said. He had a marvelous voice, radio-announcer perfect with the trace of an accent I could n't identify. " I understand that Mr. Girard retained you on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said warily. A call from Arthur Costa suggested that the week that had started so poorly was about to get even worse. " That 's correct. " " I wonder if you could manage to see me today. It 's a matter of some urgency. Joe has been arrested for the murder of Judge Reiter. " It took a minute for the words to penetrate, and when they did, I felt as if someone had knocked the breath out of me. " The murder of Judge Reiter? " I stammered. " Yes. I assume you have n't heard of it. " Monday mornings are hard enough without starting them off with a dose of the news. I rarely listen to the radio, and this morning I 'd even skipped the front page of the Chronicle. " No, I had n't heard. Can you tell me what happened? " " Judge Reiter was found dead in his study early Sunday morning. He 'd been struck on the head with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? " " Yes. They can place Joe at Reiter 's house at eight Saturday night. Death occurred sometime between eight and ten. Joe has made no secret of his belief that Reiter is responsible for his cousin 's death. They have motive and opportunity. Enough for an arrest. They arraigned him this morning. He 's being held without bail. " I tried to make sense of what he was telling me. It was shocking enough that Samuel Reiter was dead, but the idea that Joe might have killed him was even more disturbing. " What does Joe say? " I asked. p164 " He says he 's innocent, that he left the house about twenty minutes after he arrived, and Reiter was alive at that time. " I did n't ask if Costa believed Joe ; it 's not a relevant question for a defense attorney. Costa 's job was n't to decide on Joe 's guilt or innocence, but simply to provide him with the best defense possible. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The judge had an assistant who admitted Joe at eight, then left shortly thereafter. He discovered Reiter 's body when he returned home this morning. " An assistant. That had to be the tall young man who 'd opened the door the night I visited Reiter. " Joe has asked that I retain you as my investigator in this case. I 'm agreeable to that if you 're willing to take the case. " " You know that I do n't usually do criminal work. " " Yes, and I 've discussed that with Joe. He 's most adamant that he wants you to continue. Your rates are somewhat higher than my regular investigator 's, but I 'll pay them. " Very generous, except that Arthur Costa would n't be paying my rates, he 'd be billing them to Joe. A well-known San Francisco lawyer, when asked how much it cost for a first-degreemurder defense, once responded, " Whatever you 've got. " I feared that was what Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll take the case, " I told Costa. " Did you say that they 've denied Joe bail? " " That 's correct. It 's outrageous. A combination of bad luck and worse timing. The judge we drew is tough under the best of circumstances, but only a week ago he released a man on bail who subsequently shot his wife. " " But this is a first offense, and Joe 's a member of the bar. Ca n't you appeal? " " I 'm doing that, but since the victim is a public official, it 's a special-circumstances situation, and they are within their p165 rights to deny bail. I am not optimistic about our chances of a reversal. " I 'd like you to see Joe today if you can. Take him through his activities on the night of the murder in as much detail as possible. Tape the interview. I can see you at three this afternoon. Let my secretary know if you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tried to absorb the information I 'd just been given. Reiter 's death was a shock, but it was Joe I was worried about. Was it possible that he had killed Samuel Reiter? Anyone can kill, and Joe had plenty of reason to hate the judge, but I could n't imagine him as a killer. Joe believed in the law the way Catholics believe in the Eucharist. I just could n't see him taking it into his own hands. The thought of Joe in jail filled me with fear. Joe would not do well in jail. In fact, he might not survive it. He was n't a guy who knew how to back off or keep a low profile, and he had a bad attitude toward authority. He 'd alienate the guards, then he 'd side with some poor, weak inmate against the more powerful, predatory cons who called the shots. No one would be surprised when he became a jailhouse casualty. Working for Joe was supposed to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back all my feelings of anger and helplessness. Only this time I was n't helpless. I made myself a promise that Joe was not going to end up like Orrin. Joe was being held at the Oakland jail, a formidable square tower with slits for windows that squatted next to the Nimitz Freeway. It 's a classic example of the concrete block construction so common to buildings dealing with law and order. I do n't know whether the designers wanted it to be ugly, depressing, or intimidating, but they achieved all three. I checked in, and was taken to the attorney 's booth, which p166 was really a glass cage facing another glass cage, next to several more pairs of glass cages. In the cage next to me a small black man in his forties talked with his client, a tired-looking guy who could have had a job on celebrity wrestling. The little guy did a lot of hand waving, but it was all motion and no sound. I sat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one was looking at me. Just being this close to confinement made me jumpy. I thought first of Orrin, then of Joe. As if cued by my thoughts, the door in the cubicle opposite to me opened, and Joe walked in and sat down. He looked pale and drawn. He seemed to have lost weight since I 'd last seen him. " How 're you holding up? " I asked. " I 've been in jail before, " he said cockily. He waited for a response, then shrugged. " Okay, civil disobedience is different from murder one. And I hate jail, thank you. I 've always hated jail. But you want to know something funny, the guards have been nicer to Joe Girard, the killer, than they ever were to Joe Girard, the good citizen. " He gave a mirthless laugh. " My roommate is a twenty-year-old who shot two people in a SevenEleven. A real nice guy. " I nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people you 'd most like to avoid, and you get to meet them when they 're at their most angry and have the least reason to restrain themselves. It does n't take a lot of imagination to understand why prison holds such terror for the weak and defenseless. " Tell me what happened the night you went to Reiter 's, " I said. " I assume that whatever I tell you is covered by attorneyclient privilege. " " It is. I 'm working for your attorney, " I said, bracing myself for a confession. " I have n't told the police about what Reiter did to me. They still think that my only connection with him is through Mitch. " p167 " Have you told your lawyer? " " Not really. " " Joe, there is n't any room for not really ' when you 're putting together a murder defense. Arthur needs to know the whole thing. " " I 'm not telling anyone else about it. That 's the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out, then lowered my voice, " this is a murder charge, and a very substantial one, that you 're facing. If you do n't want to spend the rest of your life in jail, you 'd better stop worrying about what happened to you as a kid and start worrying about what 's going to happen to you as an adult. " The way his jaw tightened and set told me he was n't about to listen to me. " Telling the cops what happened would just give them a better motive, " he said. " It does n't help my case any. " " You still need to tell Arthur. " " You do it. I do n't want to talk about it, " Joe said grimly. " What happened at Reiter 's? " I asked. " He called me around seven and asked if we could meet. I did n't want to. Shit, I 've worked for years to put all this behind me. But he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of us. " Joe looked down for a moment and wiped one hand across his eyes. " I do n't know why I went. It sure as hell was n't because I thought it 'd help. Maybe I just wanted to see him squirm. " The assistant was there when I arrived, but he must have gone out because he was n't around when I left. Anyway, Sam was pretty loaded. He offered me a drink, and I took one. He was refilling his glass before mine was half empty. " It was all right at first. I mean he wanted to know what I 'd done with myself, was pleased that I 'd chosen the law. He played the proud father like he 'd done when I was a kid. The more he talked, the more pissed off I felt. I was about to tell him he was full of shit when he started telling me it was his influence that had made me what I am, how nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The bastard wanted me to say that what he 'd done was okay, that it was really good. " I exploded. I told him that was bullshit, and that he did n't know how much he 'd hurt me. That he 'd totally screwed up Mitch. I wanted to tell him the whole thing -- the years of therapy, all the relationships I 've screwed up just when they were getting good, the loneliness, the never trusting anyone, God, all of it. But he did n't want to listen. " He started yelling at me. I do n't even know what he said, because by then I was so angry I could n't listen to him anymore. I threw my glass at him -- I think it broke on his desk? then I just walked out. I got in my car and drove around for hours before I came home. " " And the next day the police arrested you. " " Yeah. I was there, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. He was still yelling when I went out the door. " " Was there anyone in the house when you left? " " I did n't see anyone. " " But he called you ; that 's why you went to see him? " " Yeah. " " We 'll have to get access to his phone records for that night, " I said. " We need to know who else he called. " " You mean he might have called the killer, just like he did me? Why? " " From what you say, he was distraught, anxious to talk. If he called you, he may well have called other victims or their families. Maybe he got someone who was less able to control his anger than you are. " Joe nodded. " Yeah, that 's a real possibility. He seemed to need me to tell him that what he 'd done was okay, that it was no big deal. " He shook his head in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he called someone else. Someone he knew could be manipulated to give him the answers he wanted. " " Or someone he knew would blow up, " Joe suggested. " As p169 I think about it, he was more than drunk, he was depressed. Maybe he was looking for someone to whack him. " " A cowardly suicide? It 's possible, " I said, " but I doubt that it 'll play well in court. What did you do after you left? " " I just drove around for a long time, first around Piedmont, then out Highway 24 to Walnut Creek and back. I needed to cool off and get myself together. " " Anyone see you? " Joe shook his head. " I do n't think so. " I took him back through the whole day, from the time he put on his socks to when he climbed in bed. I took notes and got it all on tape. There was n't much on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me to find a murderer three weeks ago ; now the alleged killer was dead, and Joe needed his own defense against a murder charge. Another three weeks on this job and maybe I 'd be in jail. The trend was not in the right direction. I got back to the city a little before two o'clock, too early for my meeting with Arthur Costa, enough time to check in at the office. Amy informed me that I looked as though my favorite cat had died, and I probably should not see any clients in my current condition. I knew the situation was serious when she offered to fix me a cup of tea. She handed me four pink message slips. Not surprisingly, one was from Kevin Doyle. I hate to see cases tried in the press, but there are times when access to the media is important, and Kevin had shown himself to be a thoughtful and intelligent reporter. It might be very handy to have him on our side. Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked with Arthur Costa. I did call the mysterious seven-digit number I 'd found in Mitch 's car. I 'd gotten the recording so many times that I was p171 startled when a human voice answered. The voice was masculine, low and fairly gruff. " Yes. " " Jonah? " I said, hoping the name and number were connected by more than coincidence. " What? Who is this? " the voice demanded. " I was trying to call Jonah. Is this the right number? " " Who 's calling? " Suspicion and a hint of hostility hardened the voice. It told me that there was some connection between the name and number. I doubted that the man I was speaking to was Jonah. His reaction to the name was wrong, but he knew Jonah and had some reason to distrust anyone who mentioned him. " This is Catherine Small, " I said, using one of the names I 'd developed for situations like this. " Who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I want to talk to him. Can you tell me how to get ahold of him? " " Give me your number. I 'll have him call you. " I gave him the unlisted office number. He would n't be able to trace it back to me, and if he called, we 'd be expecting him. I called Arthur Costa 's office and was told to come right on over. The address was downtown in one of the skyscrapers that keep sprouting around the Embarcadero. Costa 's not a Belli or Hallinan or Erlich, one of those men who create legends and end up in Herb Caen 's column for their clever one-liners, but he is well known and highly respected among the legal community. He 's been mentioned for the bench more than once, and the next time the powers that be are looking for a Spanishsurname judge, they may well look his way. They 'd probably have tapped him much sooner if his sharp tongue and independent mind had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file on Joe and headed for Costa 's office. As I drove downtown I realized that I was n't looking forward to p172 working for Arthur Costa. I do n't work for lawyers. I work for the people who hire lawyers, and that means the lawyers have to be reasonably polite to me. I like to call the shots. I had a hunch Arthur Costa did, too. Costa 's office was decorated in a style I call tasteful-expensive. It comes in modern and traditional, and he 'd chosen the traditional version with lots of heavy wood and brass, thick carpeting, and paintings of dogs and horses on the wood-paneled walls. I suppose it makes his clients feel secure to know that their lawyer is so well-heeled. It 'd just make me feel poorer. Costa was in his late forties, and the years showed around his middle but not in the thick dark hair that he left cut just slightly long. His face was roundish and dominated by thick eyebrows that slanted down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd take him for a mild-mannered accountant. He seated me on a large leather couch and took the armchair next to it ; his secretary brought us coffee. I do envy unliberated employers who can get away with asking their secretaries to make coffee. Amy would just ask solicitously if I 'd hurt my arm. Costa had me go over my work for Joe from the beginning, and as he probed and questioned the mild-mannered accountant disappeared, and I got a taste of the sharp mind behind his bland brown eyes. I decided that working for Arthur Costa might be fun after all. When I told Costa that Joe had been abused by Reiter, he restrained himself to a heartfelt " Damn, " then demanded, " Who else knows this? " " Joe 's been in therapy for it, so his therapist knows. Beyond that, I doubt that he 's told anyone. " " No need for it to come out, then, " Costa said. " It just provides the prosecution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my investigation. He considered what I 'd told him. " I know you 're not experienced at this, " he said, " but how would you go about constructing a defense? " p173 " Joe does n't remember much about where he drove after leaving Reiter 's, so there 's not much chance of developing a credible alibi. I 'm used to looking for the guilty party, so I 'd want to know who else might have visited Reiter that night. It was only a few days after his arrest. There must be a number of parents who just discovered that their sons were molested, maybe even some adults for whom the arrest brought back painful memories. " " Reasonable doubt, " Costa said. " It 's a weak defense. " " There 's the wife. Joe did n't see her ; he does n't think she was home, but I 'll check on her. And there 's the assistant. If he 's the man I met at Reiter 's, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former victim. It 's not unusual for a pedophile to continue his relationship with boys after the sexual liaison ends. He could have been jealous or afraid of exposure. " Costa nodded. I continued. " Then there 's the issue of Mitch 's death. Two murder victims connected to each other ; you have to wonder if the killer might be the same person. " " But you do n't have anything on Mitch 's killer. " " No. " I had a feeling that Mel R. from AA might know something, but it was too early to tell. " I 'd like to keep working on that angle. I might be getting close to someone who knew what Mitch was doing, but I wo n't know for a day or two, maybe more. " " Well, one of the things I want you to do is develop alternate suspects. But there are some fairly routine jobs that I 'll need from you first. I 'll want you to gather the discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DA 's Office. He 'll give you copies of the police reports, information from the technicians and the lab, autopsy protocol, photos, taped statements. My secretary will give you a letter authorizing you to receive them. " I groaned inwardly at the name Tom Roselli. He was an old friend of my ex-husband, Dan Walker. Both Dan and Tom had started out on the SFPD. Dan had stayed and risen to homicide p174 inspector. Tom had left to work for the District Attorney 's Office. The DA 's Office is a lot easier than working the street. It 's as close as you come to a nine-to-five job in law en-forcement. Knowing the inspector in charge ought to have been a help, except that Tom had never recovered from a bad case of male chauvinism imparted by his Italian father. He was capable of making cracks about keeping women barefoot and pregnant without the least embarrassment, and he was the only man I knew who referred to me as " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse to take me seriously or act openly hostile because of the divorce, probably both. Costa continued. " The way we work, you 're my eyes and ears, you understand. You go to the police property room and look at any evidence they 've got. It 's usually just routine, but maybe you 'll see something that is n't quite right or raises questions. You do n't even need to know why it feels funny, just tell me if it does. A feeling can be the beginning of a theory. " I 'll want a statement from the assistant. And start digging to see if there 's anything to your hunch about him being a past victim. Get a statement from the wife, even if she was n't there that night, and from the neighbors, and anybody else who might know something. " I 'll subpoena the phone company to provide us with Judge Reiter 's phone records for the last week and to reveal the name that goes with the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it down today, and with luck they 'll have the information for us in a day or two. They can try to quash the subpoena, but I do n't think we 'll have a problem. " I told Costa about Kevin Doyle and showed him a copy of Kevin 's story in the Chronicle. " Do you want me to talk to him, or should I avoid him? " Costa pursed his lips and considered it. " He could conceivably be useful at some point -- not yet, I think, but maybe in p175 the future. Try to stay on good terms with him. Do n't tell him anything unless you clear it with me first. " As we were finishing up Costa said, " I get the impression that you 're a friend of Joe 's. " " Yes, " I said. " He 's a friend as well as a colleague. " Costa nodded. " Yes, I also consider him a friend. He does good work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate to see him go to jail. " " I think jail for a man like Joe could be a death sentence, " I said, giving voice to a fear that had haunted me all day. Costa nodded. His expression was grave. " He would make the wrong kind of enemies, I think. " " On both sides. " " Yes, on both sides. That 's why it 's imperative that we keep him out of jail. " " I 'll do my best to help you do that, " I said, praying that my best would be good enough. Costa 's secretary whipped out the subpoena for the phone company in a matter of minutes, and I made a dash for the Pac Bell building to deliver it before closing. There were no parking places, but then there are never any parking places in this city. Maybe at 2:00 A.M., but never when I 'm looking. I left the Volvo in a red zone. A bored woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet. I groveled rather well as I urged her to expedite the request, and stressed how important it was. She did n't seem nearly as impressed as I would have liked. Back at the office, Jesse was getting ready to head home. " Can you stay a minute? " I asked. " I may be digging us into a hole ; you should probably know about it. " p176 I told him about Joe 's arrest and my meeting with Costa. " We 've never worked criminal defense. I realized after I agreed to take the case that I should run it by you. " Jesse looked surprised. He was no more used to being a partner than I was to having one. " Hey, it 's your call, " he said. " What do you want me to do? " Unqualified support. That was exactly what I needed just now. " You 've just done it, " I said. " Can you stay on top of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this one? " " No problem. I 'll even take on the Glosser case if you 'd like. " Did I want the albatross off my neck? You bet. Glosser 's finances were complex, and I had n't had the time to trace them the way I wanted to. I was only too happy to hand the job over to Jesse. I gave him my first full smile of the day. " I 'd love it, as long as you feel okay about doing it. " " Vigilante justice is one of my specialties. What do you have so far? " " Nothing solid. I 've been too busy to do much on it. I 've got two companies held as limited partnerships that look interesting. In both cases, the ownership is hidden in a maze of different entities. Then there 's Sunnyside Properties and a man named Milton Diesman. " p177 If things were dicey at work, they were n't any better on the home front. I arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there. Peter had left a message on the machine, saying that he was going out with friends to play music. I usually join them. Tonight I was n't invited. Molly had n't left any message at all, but there was a message from Gil, the teacher who ran Phoenix, telling us that Molly had missed school, and asking us to call him. " I 'm having a hard time getting through to her, " he said. " Sometimes an idea catches her interest and she really takes off, but a lot of the time she 's just coasting in neutral. " " Do you think she 's on something? " I asked. " No, not at school, anyway. But she 's talked about some friends of hers who 're clearly into street life. If she keeps hanging out with them, it could happen. That 's why I wanted you to know she 'd skipped school. " It 's real seductive for a kid like Molly. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she enjoys the freedom. Living with a bunch of kids sounds just great. No one to tell you what to do. Every- p178 body sharing drugs and booze. She does n't realize what else goes with that. Your friends put you up for a while, but at some point it 's your turn to contribute something for food and drugs, and what does a fourteen-year-old have to sell except her body? " I felt sick and sat down on the floor so I could lean against the wall. I 'd known all this, I suppose, but had refused to think about Molly in those terms. " What can I do? " I asked Gil. " Just what you have been doing. Be there for her. Let her know you care. You ca n't live her life, and you ca n't lock her in a closet. She 's a good kid, basically, and smart. She 'll make it okay. " He offered me a few more platitudes, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall in the dark with thoughts I did n't want to have. It was just before midnight when Molly came in the front door and tried to sneak down the hall to her bedroom. I had weeks of AA meetings to thank for the fact that I had n't crawled into a gin bottle during the long hours while I waited for her. I had, however, drunk enough coffee and tea to be running on a caffeine high that probably would n't wear off for days. " It is n't midnight yet, " she said defensively. She reeked of marijuana. " You missed school today, " I said. " Yeah, " she said, trying to sound defiant. " It 's boring. And the kids are boring. They 're not much better than the ones in Palo Alto. " " And the streets are fun. " " Yeah. " " Tell me one thing. Where do your friends get their money? " " What money? " p179 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the food, whatever else they need. " " I do n't know. They get jobs when they need some money, and Cindy has a boyfriend who helps her out. " " A boyfriend? Or a pimp? " Molly looked shocked. " It 's not like that, " she said indignantly. " Is n't it? Does Cindy do dates? " Molly looked sullen. " Sometimes, but only when she feels like it. " " Or needs the money. Or the drugs. " " You do n't understand, " she shouted. " I understand that life at home can be so tough that even the street seems better. But I do n't understand why life here is that bad. " " It 's not you, " she said. " I mean I really appreciate all you 're doing. It 's just that I enjoy hanging out with Cindy and Rae. I 'm not doing drugs or anything. I do n't know why you 're so uptight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failing when I was a kid, and now I was definitely uptight. " I 'm uptight because I love you, and I do n't want anything to happen to you, " I said. " The streets are dangerous. " I could have given her the litany of dangers I 'd spent the last three hours reciting to myself -- bad drugs, men who regard an underage girl as a special treat, AIDS, any of the assorted psychos who place no value on human life -- but she was n't about to listen to me. She looked at me with the same expression I 'd used on my mother. And I was sorely tempted to adopt my mother 's reaction to that look, which was to send her to her room. Instead, I said, " Okay, this is how it plays. If you want to stay here, you go to school and you 're home by six on school nights. That 's six in the evening, not the morning. Understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you living with me or with Marion, or are you ready to join your friends on the street? " I prayed that she 'd give me the right answer. I had no idea what I 'd do if she chose the street, but I knew that it was time for me to set the rules. " Shit, I guess I 'll stay here, " she grumbled. " Good, and you agree not to cut school or stay out after six? " " Yeah. Can I go to bed now? " I 'd have liked a hug, some little sign that the wonderful twelve-year-old who used to inhabit that body was still in there somewhere, but she stalked past me and slammed the door. Peter came in a little later, rosy from too much beer and smelling like cigar smoke. Now that I did n't have to worry about Molly, I was furious at her for putting me through such hell. Peter was a convenient target for all that anger. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered his I-just-need-some-space speech, I suggested he could find that at his own place. That 's exactly what he decided to do. I do n't like to sleep alone ; it makes me grumpy. The next morning, I was not in the best of moods to tackle a visit to the Alameda County District Attorney 's Office and Tom Roselli, but I did n't have much choice. Tom greeted me heartily -- a bit too heartily -- called me Katie, which I 've always hated, and led me down the hall to his office. He delivered his condolences on my divorce with an attitude more appropriate to a diagnosis of terminal cancer, and launched into an enumeration of my ex-husband 's virtues. When he paused for breath, I said, " I 'm here about the Reiter homicide. I 'm working for the defense. " p181 He chuckled condescendingly. " What 's a nice girl like you doing on a case like that? " I wondered how much you 'd get for slugging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetly and said, " Tom, can we cut the crap and get down to work? " A dark, ugly look crossed Tom 's face. I was not being a nice girl. He was offended. I did n't give a damn. If I was n't going to get any advantage from being nice, I was at least going to have the pleasure of not taking any shit from Roselli. " Katie, " he said. " My name is Catherine, " I said. " And you would do well to remember that any obstruction by your office can have an adverse effect on the prosecution. " Roselli was looking downright mean. " And you 'd do well to remember to keep a civil tongue in your head. " We glared at each other, then I switched tactics and smiled. " How is Anne Marie? " I asked. That caught him off guard. Anne Marie is his daughter, about Molly 's age. She 's the apple of her daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was driving him nuts by proving her prowess in judo. Tom ca n't talk about Anne Marie without smiling. He mellowed noticeably and said, " She 's doing fine. Pretty as a picture, boys calling her every night, and straight A 's in school. " " That 's terrific, " I said. " And the judo? " " She 's a purple belt now, and she was a finalist in the national championships this year. " " You must be very proud. " He nodded. " It does n't seem like anything a girl should want to do, but she loves it. And it 'll keep her safe on the streets. You did some of that, did n't you? " " Aikido. My dad feels about it the same way you do. " It was n't true. My dad had applauded my decision to study martial arts, but I was going to get a lot further with Roselli if he p182 thought of me as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Dan Walker 's ex-wife. " So you 're working on this Reiter thing. A nasty piece of business all around. " I nodded. " I did the investigation that revealed the child abuse, so I know that part of it, " I said. " Not so hard to understand why your client wanted to kill him, " Roselli replied. " I imagine there were quite a lot of people who felt the same way -- former victims, parents of recent victims, brothers, even sisters. " Roselli nodded grimly, his expression indicating that he 'd be leading the lynch mob if his son had been a victim. " True, but Girard is the only one we can place at the scene. " I had him walk me through what they 'd found, and did n't learn much that was new. The cause of death was a blow to the head. Murder weapon, a heavy brass paperweight. The paperweight had been wiped clean of fingerprints ; however, Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the judge 's desk. " Was the front door locked? " I asked. " No. Closed but unlocked. " " Joe does n't know if it was locked when he left. It seems unlikely that the assistant would have left it unlocked. That means someone had to unlock it that evening. " " Could have been Girard as easily as anyone. " " Or it could have been Reiter who unlocked it after Joe left, because he was expecting someone else. " " Who? " " Someone he called, just as he called Joe. Or someone who 'd already arranged to come by. " " We 're checking out the phone calls, " Roselli said. " But I think you 're grasping at straws. " " How about the wife? " I asked. " In Denver on business. " p183 " The assistant? " " What about him? " " Does he have an alibi? " " He does. Besides, he has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I gave Roselli my theory that the assistant might be a former victim and possibly a current confederate. I was on the edge again. The look on Roselli 's face told me that nice women did not discuss such subjects with cool objectivity. " You 're accusing this man of being a former victim? " he asked tightly. " I think it 's worth checking, " I said. Roselli did n't say he 'd do it, but I knew he was too good a cop not to. When I left, he shook hands and said, " Good-bye, Catherine. Good luck on your case. " My mother likes to say that you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar, and it 's true, but sometimes it helps to leave the vinegar open, just to make the smell of honey sweeter. p184 I stopped by the jail to see Joe after I left Roselli 's office. He looked tense and drawn, and he 'd developed a slight nervous tic in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but there was a brittleness to his manner. " It 's a real kick living with a lunatic, " he said. " This guy has the moral awareness of a sea slug, and his hold on reality 's tenuous at best. " " Is he dangerous? " I asked. " Hell, he killed two people. Of course he 's dangerous. " " I 'll ask Arthur to try to get you a new cellmate. " " Do n't bother. This guy 's probably no worse than lots of the others, and one thing I 'm learning here is that you can always do worse. " It was Tuesday afternoon. I 'd been waiting all week for a second shot at Mitch 's AA friend, Mel R. With Joe bunking with the 7-Eleven killer, my need to find out more about Mitch had become urgent. Reiter 's death might not be connected to Mitch 's, but it was the best lead we had right now, and my p185 stomach was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the man I hoped could tell me what Mitch was doing just before his death. Mel R. was there, leading the meeting again. I sat with the backbenchers and did n't volunteer anything. I spent most of the time looking at the floor, hoping that Mel would take it as a sign of backsliding. If anything would draw him to me, it was his desire to help. After the meeting, he headed for me immediately. " So how 's it going? " " One day at a time, " I said, smiling slightly. " I almost blew it last night, but I 'm still here. " " hood, that 's good, " he said, giving my hand a squeeze. " That 's how it happens, one day at a time. " " I still think about Mitch all the time. His cousin was arrested for murder. " Mel looked surprised. He clearly had n't heard about Joe. " The man who molested Mitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of days ago, and the police arrested Mitch 's cousin. But I do n't think he did it. See, I think the same guy who killed Mitch killed the judge, and if I knew more about what Mitch was up to, I 'd know who the son of a bitch was. " " You have to let the past go, " Mel said. " Easy for you to say. It was n't your friend who got killed. " " But it was. Mitch was a friend of mine, too. " Bingo. My hunch had been right. " And you do n't care about who killed him? " " He 's dead, Catherine, that 's all that matters. " The hall had almost emptied. I took Mel 's arm. " Can we go for coffee somewhere, just talk a little more? " " Sure, " he said. " Sure, we can. " I hate lying to good people. Scamming sleazeballs and liars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to someone like Mel makes me feel rotten. Not rotten enough to stop, but rotten all the same. p186 We found a coffee shop a block away. It was actually a little hamburger joint, and the counterman did n't look at all pleased when we only ordered coffee. He sat the heavy white ceramic mugs down hard enough to make the coffee slosh over onto the table. " You were his sponsor, I 'll bet, " I said, when the counterman had gone back to his grill. Mel looked surprised. He was n't good at disguising his thoughts and feelings. " Let 's just say I was his friend, like you were. And I have to go on, just as you do. " The problem with pretending you 're someone you 're not is that you have to tell the truth at some point or give up the chance to get your informant to make a formal statement. I doubted that I could get Mel to talk to the police, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit who I was. " Mel, I need to tell you something, " I said, " but I want you to promise that you wo n't walk out on me when I do it. " I 'm sure he thought I was going to confess to falling off the wagon. That would have been a far safer confession than I had to offer. " Will you hear me all the way through? " " Of course. " " Only part of what I 've told you is true. I was n't a friend of Mitch 's. I 'm an investigator working for his cousin Joe. You probably know that Joe refused to help Mitch. When Mitch was killed, he asked me to find the killer and to see that Samuel Reiter was exposed. " Mel 's face had contracted into anger and suspicion. I continued. " Mitch did n't have many friends outside AA. Our only hope of finding someone who knew what he 'd been doing just before his death was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spied on us, " he said, his voice tight with anger. " I lied. I did n't spy. I 'm not about to repeat anything I heard at meetings. But I need to know about Mitch, and you may be the only one alive who can point the way to his killer. " p187 " I told you it 's over. Mitch is dead. " " But what caused his death is n't over. The kids in the book are n't dead. They 're still alive, and I suspect they need help. " Mel frowned. I was sure now that he knew about the photo book. " Did he show you the book? " I asked. " Some of those kids were n't much more than babies. " Mel 's face clouded. " Leave me alone. I know your kind. You lie and use people. Well, you 're not getting anything from me. " It was my turn to be angry. " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and killing a friend than be caught helping a woman who misrepresented herself at an AA meeting. That 's a real interesting set of values, where lying is worse than abuse and murder. I think you 're just feeling sorry for yourself and angry that I did n't play by the rules. I do n't think you give a shit about Mitch or what he was trying to do. " Mel looked like he might hit me, and the narrow booth did n't allow much room to maneuver. Then he took a deep breath and closed his eyes. He sat like that -- rigid, eyes closed, taking deep, irregular breaths until his shoulders began to relax and the breathing became regular. Finally, he opened his eyes. " You 're lucky. You 'd said that to me three years ago, I 'd have taken your head off. " " You would n't have reacted so strongly if you did n't care about Mitch. So what 's keeping you from helping me? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chewed on it. I forced myself to sit quietly and wait. The decision was his to wrestle with. At last, Mel said, " What, exactly, do you want from me? " " Just that you tell me all that you know about what Mitch was doing and thinking in the weeks before his death. It may be that something you know could lead to the killer and could help locate the kids in the book. " Mel shook his head. " You know enough about AA to understand that I ca n't reveal what Mitch told me. " p188 " That 'd make sense if Mitch were alive, but he 's not, so who are you protecting, except the man who killed him? " Mel stared into his coffee cup as if seeking a solution there. " You probably know all about the abuse, " he said slowly. " Well, Mitch took to following the judge -- what was his name? " " Reiter. " " He figured that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid to go to the police. He had a camera and he was hoping to get pictures. The second night he followed Reiter, they ended up in Emeryville in an area that 's mostly warehouses. Reiter met some other guy driving a Mercedes, and the guy got out of his car and went with Reiter. " Mitch lost Reiter 's car when they got on the freeway, so he went back to the Mercedes. He had boosted some cars as a kid and knew how to get into the Mercedes. That 's where he found the photo book. " " So the book did n't come from Reiter but from one of his friends. " Mel nodded. " Mitch waited. They came back several hours later, and he tailed the guy in the Mercedes to someplace in Oakland. He knew that Reiter 's buddy must also be a ped, and he figured that maybe he could get them both. He said it 'd be a lot easier to stake out this guy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piedmont. " I nodded, thinking how obvious a man in an old Ford would have been on the affluent and politely deserted streets of Piedmont.. " And then? " " That 's it. That 's the last I heard from him. I called several times, and he was n't there. Recovering alcoholics are n't the most reliable people. I figured that he 'd slipped and gone on a drunk. It seems strange now, but I did n't even consider that he might have been killed until you came to the meeting. " " Did he have a car license or a name or anything to identify the man in the Mercedes? " " I think he did, a name maybe, but not a complete one. I p189 remember he said it was like AA, where you get the first name and an initial, and that 's it. " " Jonah T.? " " Yeah, I think that 's it. " " Would you tell the police this? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I do n't get along with cops. " " How about giving a statement to Joe 's lawyer? " " I do n't like lawyers, either. I got ta go now. " He slid out of the booth. I caught him before he got to the door. I wanted his name and a way to find him, but I knew he would n't give them to me. " I wo n't hassle you, " I said. " But if you think of anything more, will you call me? " I pressed one of my regular cards into his hand. He nodded uncertainly and hurried out the door. I waited a minute, then followed him. There 's no way you can follow someone who knows you for any distance if they 're looking for a tail. But Mel was upset, and I hoped he would n't be looking too hard or going too far. I crossed the street so I was n't directly behind him and stayed a block back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he did n't look across the street. He 'd left his car on a side street a couple of blocks from the meeting. Unless he made a U-turn, he was going to have to drive right by me. I stepped into a doorway and waited. As the car went by, I got the license number. Arthur Costa was not nearly so elated as I about Mel R. 's revelation. " I 'm not sure how useful he 'd be even if he were willing to testify, but without that, we have nothing. " " Not yet, but I 'm one step closer to finding Jonah T., and that may put me one step closer to finding out who killed Samuel Reiter. " Perry Mason was probably the only defense attorney to think p190 in terms of finding the guilty party. Costa was clearly far more concerned with building a case that would get Joe off than with finding out who had committed the actual murder. I did n't think we had much chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I did n't expect the Oakland police to be a lot more receptive to my story than Costa had been. A week ago, when Joe was an interested citizen instead of an alleged murderer, they might have taken a different view. Now, Reiter 's mysterious friend would sound like a convenient ploy on the part of the defense. I pointed out to Warren that I 'd given him the name Jonah T. and the phone number several days before Reiter 's murder. He thanked me for the information and assured me that he 'd check on the unlisted phone number. His tone was polite and distant, and vaguely patronizing. He reminded me of a doctor who once told me not to worry about the pain in my side. That was a couple of days before my appendix ruptured. As he terminated our conversation he said, " This is a police matter now. I appreciate your help in finding Morrison 's friends, but I wo n't have you interfering with an ongoing investigation. Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said, thinking that if the investigation were a bit more ongoing, I would n't need to be involved. Kevin Doyle was n't one to wait till I got around to calling. The third time he phoned, Amy begged me to take the call. " I really like Joe, " he said. " I 'd like to help him if there 's any way I can. This is a big enough story that the papers are going to give it lots of play. Believe me, you 'll do better with me on your side. " I made the appropriate polite sounds about how much I appreciated his concern and his willingness to help. He interrupted. " I talked to Joe a couple of hours ago.... " " At the jail? " I asked in surprise. " He agreed to see you? " p191 " Yes. And he suggested that I call you. " Oh, great, I thought. Joe had been watching too much television if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to solve a crime. " He said you thought that the killer might be someone Reiter had molested in the past or the parent of one of the victims. " " Those people certainly have a motive, " I said cautiously. I was uncomfortable discussing the case with Kevin. I did n't want to find myself explaining to Arthur Costa how quotes with my name on them found their way into the Chronicle. " Look, I 'd really like to help, " he said. " I guess I feel a little guilty. Maybe if I 'd gone over that night when he called me, he would n't have gotten killed. " " Reiter called you that night? " " Yeah. He 'd seen the story I did on him and he wanted to tell his side of it. I 'd have gone, but I must have eaten something that did n't agree with me, and I 'd spent the last couple of hours throwing up, so I was n't in much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I was driving to Piedmont. I told him I 'd see him the next day. " " What time did he call? " " Jeez, I do n't know, I was n't in, much shape to worry about the time. Joe said something about phone records. It 'd be there, would n't it? " " Was it before or after eight? " " I think it was after, but I could n't swear to it. It was dark. I know that. Does it matter? " It mattered a lot. If Reiter called after eight, it proved that he was alive when Joe left. Of course, I still had to prove that Joe had left before Reiter made the call. " Did Reiter sound like he had anyone else there? " I asked. " No, I did n't get that impression. " " Did he seem to have been drinking? " " I do n't know. Maybe. His speech was a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed those phone records. I wondered how much longer it would take and made a mental note to call the phone company. In the pause, Kevin shifted gears and asked, " Do you think the judge 's death is connected to Mitch 's murder? And do you know any more about that? " " I might, " I said. " I 'll call you back on that. " Kevin did n't want to let me go without the full story, but I did n't give him any choice. Costa was n't thrilled that Joe had talked with Kevin, but he agreed that we were better off with the Chronicle raising questions about Mitch 's death than with it hammering away at Joe. He was cautiously optimistic about the revelation of Kevin 's call. " It could be helpful, " he said. " Let me know as soon as you get the phone records. " Kevin was waiting anxiously for my call. He and Costa were at opposite ends of the energy spectrum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt tired just listening to him ; the lawyer was so low-key I thought he might have gone to sleep while I was talking. I told Kevin that we knew Mitch had been following a man who appeared to be a friend of Samuel Reiter and had come into possession of a photo album containing incriminating evidence. We believed that he was following that same man the night of his death. It was n't nearly enough for Kevin. He wanted to know about the album and the man and where Mitch had followed him. I 've spent too much time with cops to offer anything more than general information. Give out specifics, and you have a dozen confessions and no way to tell if one of them is genuine. Kevin asked if there was any indication that Reiter 's friend was a pedophile. I said there was, and that was the last thing he got from me except good-bye. p193 Molly and I spent a tense evening alone. She arrived home at five fifty-nine, but there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she gave me the silent treatment during dinner. I had the evening to reflect that I 'd replaced a very desirable lover with a sullen teenager. It did n't seem like a smart move. Peter and I are well matched in pride and stubbornness. I was the one who 'd yelled at him ; I 'd have to make the phone call. Crow was never my favorite dish, but I knew it only took a few bites to earn dessert. I was in considerably better spirits the next morning. I 'd have liked to share a leisurely breakfast with Peter, but the memory of Joe in jail drove me to the office early. I called the phone company to see about our subpoena for Reiter 's phone records and got a perky young woman who really wanted to help but did n't know anything about the subpoenas. She informed me that the legal department was reviewing whether or not to honor the subpoenas, and they would contact me as soon as a determination had been made. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a determination has been made. " Bureaucrat-speak is an awesome thing. Waiting around for a determination did n't seem like a hot idea, so I decided to get on with interviewing Reiter 's neighbors and his assistant. I did n't expect to find too many of the neighbors home during the day, but on Reiter 's street, I might find servants and maybe some gossip. On Glen Ellen Drive the houses on the downhill side of the street have striking views of the bay and San Francisco. They date from around the turn of the century and are at least twice as large and lavish as their newer uphill neighbors. Their owners all have servants. The uphill houses have cleaning ladies and an occasional cook. The cleaning ladies spoke a variety of languages, none of them English. They were busy and would n't have had time to talk even if they 'd understood what I wanted. The servants were far too well trained to gossip with strangers. Two of them were, however, willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They did n't know a lot about Judge Reiter, but they gave me an earful about his young assistant. Jeffrey Gotelli had made no secret of the fact that he did not consider himself in the same class as the other working people on the block. Reiter 's former cook had found him so insufferable that she had quit. " I do n't think the new missus liked him much, " the cook next door confided. " She asked him to move out of his little cottage in the back after the judge died. Did n't have any further need for his services. I guess he was pretty upset about it. " I asked what they thought of the charges that Reiter was a child molester. The cook pursed her lips and shook her head. " I do n't know where they got such notions, but you 'll never convince me. He did have boys around, especially before he remarried, but what 's wrong with a man giving a hand to boys that need it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what I mean. " p195 I did n't know what she meant. Did she assume that molesters wore dirty raincoats and lurked in alleys? Or was it that Reiter was too cultured, too rich, too wellborn to indulge in such distasteful activities? Two houses up the street on the uphill side I found Mrs. BraxtonHancock. She had given the police a long statement and was willing to do the same for me. I 'd read her statement ; there was n't much there, since she 'd been out the night of Reiter 's death, but I hoped to get some background information that the police had been too busy to fish for. Mrs. Braxton-Hancock was in her sixties, a tiny bundle of energy with birdlike motions. She settled me in a chair in her living room, and made a pot of tea. She was fascinated to meet a woman private investigator and wanted to know all about it. In return she was only too happy to tell me about Samuel Reiter. She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home when he was in his early twenties. " It was a real tragedy, his parents dying like that. A boating accident, I think, on the way to Mexico. " The first Mrs. Reiter had been a local girl, someone Reiter had known in high school and later met at some social function. " They seemed the perfect couple, " Mrs. Braxton-Hancock said. " Both so attractive and intelligent. She was a painter, I think. But it did n't last very long, five years at the most. She moved away. I do n't know where. " " I thought he was a widower, " I said. " Well, I suppose in a manner of speaking. They never really divorced. She was killed in an automobile accident the next year, so he was a widower, I guess. It was a real tragedy for him. He must have pined for her, showed no interest in getting married again until a few years ago, when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point out to my hostess that it was unlikely Reiter had p196 pined for an adult woman when his major interest was young boys. She seemed completely unaware of the charges against him. Like the cook, she probably refused to believe them. " Has he always had an assistant? " I asked. " Usually. And a cook, I believe. " " And the assistants, have they been young men like the current one? " She looked at me shrewdly. " Yes. Are you suggesting something? " " No, not at all. I was just interested in what type of people the judge hired. " They 've all been very nice young men. The last one must have been with him five years at least. " " Were any of them married? " " No, of course not. The cottage is really only big enough for one. " " I know that Judge Reiter was active in many boys ' clubs. Did his assistant participate, too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know. I 've seen him bring boys to Sam 's house, and I think he may have gone along on outings with Sam 's clubs. But that does n't mean anything, you know. " We both knew what it meant, but only one of us was willing to admit it. Reiter 's assistant, Jeff Gotelli, was living in an apartment near Lake Merritt in Oakland. It was a real comedown from the cottage behind the judge 's house, but it was nice enough to make me wonder where Gotelli got the money to pay for it. His presence there on a weekday afternoon suggested that he was n't working a nine-to-five job. Molly would have described Gotelli as " drop-dead gor-geous. " In his mid- to late twenties, he was too old for her, but there are some men you can appreciate at any age. He had p197 the dark good looks of the Mediterranean -- smooth olive skin, curly black hair, and large, deep-brown eyes. Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes. I was surprised that I had n't noticed how attractive he was the night I visited Reiter. In the large, dimly lit entry hall, he 'd faded into his surroundings. In his own apartment, he looked considerably more casual and relaxed. There was nothing servile or self-effacing about the way he moved or acted. In fact, it was quite the contrary. If he was the least uncomfortable being questioned by the defense, he certainly did n't show it. I had him describe in his own words what had happened the night of Reiter 's death, and what he 'd seen when he entered the study the next morning. He told me he 'd gone to a party that Sunday night. He 'd left the house right after Joe arrived and picked up his date in another section of Piedmont at eight-twenty. They 'd arrived at the party around eight forty-five. I commented that he seemed unusually certain of the time. " I make it a point to be punc-tual, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be there at eighttwenty, I am there at eight-twenty. " " How did you meet Judge Reiter? " I asked. " He was a friend of a friend. " " Can you tell me the friend 's name? " " Actually, I ca n't. I do n't remember it. He was n't a close friend, just someone I knew casually. He knew I was looking for a job and that Sam needed an assistant. " " How long ago was that? " " Five years. " " So you were how old then? " Gotelli looked surprised, but he answered, " Twenty-two. " " What exactly were your duties? " " Mainly assisting him with his business affairs. Most people thought I was the butler or something, but I was really an administrative assistant. I did the other things because he needed someone to do them. " p198 " Did you know of Reiter 's interest in young boys? " Gotelli flushed. " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was lies, made up by people who wanted to hurt him. You know when a man is as successful as Sam, when he has talent and he 's also attractive and wealthy, it makes a lot of people jealous. " At least a dozen people were willing to testify that Jeff Gotelli had been at a party from eight forty-five till after midnight. If Reiter had called Kevin after Joe left, then the assistant had an unshakable alibi. Only the phone records could tell me that. I stopped by the phone company on my way back from Piedmont. Maybe I 'd do better in person than I had on the phone. When it only took three passes around the block before I found a place to park, I figured luck was on my side. Luck was half on my side. The lawyers had decided to release the name that went with the number in Mitch 's car. It was Edward Kohl. They were still considering our request for Reiter 's phone records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request for motor vehicle registration information for Edward Kohl. I did n't have a birth date or Social Security number and Kohl is not that unusual a name, so I figured I 'd have to wade through a bunch of records before I found the right one. Steve Marley called to ask how things were coming in Joe 's case. I gave him a quick rundown, and when I got to the name Ed Kohl, he exploded. " Kohl? Shit! " " You know the man? " " Too well. His name 's come up in several investigations. He 's a slippery bastard, always at the edge of the picture, but never so we can nail him. That 's what the Piper is about. Damn it, how could I have missed that? " p199 " Piper? " " His nickname is the Piper, as in He who pays the piper calls the tune ' or the Pied Piper. Word has it he can provide anything your average pedophile or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims to be an investment consultant, specializing in real estate. What that seems to mean is that he owns properties which he rents out at above-market rates in exchange for not asking any questions. " We busted a brothel for underage girls last year. Guess who owned the property. Oh, his name was n't on the deed. But he was a major shareholder in the company that owned the company that held the deed. He 's one slick operator. " " Capable of killing someone who got in his way? " " I would n't rule it out. I think the guy 's a real psychopath. There 's nothing inside, no moral sense, no connection to anything but his own drives. See, he 's not like the peds. They do what they do out of compulsion. He 's coming from a different place. " " So he 's not a pedophile? " " Not necessarily. All that I know about him has to do with kids, but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicks. And you can figure he 's in this for more than kicks. He 's a high roller. " " And the photo album? " " It 's the kind of thing I 'd expect him to have. Those photos were n't produced for pornography. Those kids are for sale, and you can bet that a big hunk of their earnings are coming back to the Piper. " My stomach knotted up and I got off the phone as soon as I could. I did n't doubt what Marley was telling me, but the ugliness of it was appalling. Part of me wanted to just get off this case, but even the little voice that is usually so sensible said, If decent people are too squeamish to deal with this, who does that leave to protect the children? p200 Edward Kohl was the break I 'd been hoping for. He was a prime candidate for Mitch Morrison 's and Samuel Reiter 's killer. I called Costa in high spirits. Costa reacted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very interested in Edward Kohl, but he did n't want me to take my information to the police -- not yet, anyway. " I want to decide how best to play this card, " he said. " Kohl 's name does not appear on the police report 's list of people questioned about Samuel Reiter 's death. You gave the police the telephone number? " " A week ago. Of course, I gave it to the officer in charge of the Morrison investigation, but I 'd assume that the Piedmont police have talked with him. " " Yes, certainly, but evidently they have n't followed up on the phone number. That could be very embarrassing for the prosecution. " I could imagine his sly smile. " Make an appointment to see Mr. Kohl. Find out what he has to say about Samuel Reiter and Mitch Morrison, but do n't ask what he was doing the night either one was killed. I do n't want to suggest to him that he needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which may well be lies, I want your impression of him. What kind of man is he? How will he come across in court? " I called Kohl 's office, but he was gone for the day. I reached him at ten o'clock the next morning. I 'd anticipated some difficulty in getting him to agree to see me, and I was surprised when he suggested that I come to his office that afternoon. He was so cordial I thought he must have misunderstood the purpose of my visit. I spent the morning wondering why Kohl was so willing to meet with me. It makes me nervous when things that should be difficult are easy. It 's often a sign that I 've missed something I should be paying attention to, and with an adversary like Kohl, any mistake could be dangerous. Kohl 's office was a block from the place where we 'd found Mitch 's car and right next door to where I 'd nearly been run down by the kid with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was parked just up the street. Its vanity license plate read " Jonah T. " That solved the mystery of the name Mitch had written on the paper in his car. He must have assumed, as I would have, that the license bore the name of the owner of the car. I recognized Ed Kohl at once. He was the man Mitch had sketched with Samuel Reiter in his notebook. Mitch had captured him remarkably well. He looked like an aging fraternity boy -- pleasant in a bland sort of way, good features, blond hair, blue eyes, nice straight teeth. It was hard to imagine him as a killer, but I suspect that 's true of most killers. He made small talk ; I made small talk. We both watched each other. The whole process reminded me of dogs circling and sniffing. Finally, I said, " Did you know Judge Samuel Reiter? " p202 " Only slightly, " he said. " We met occasionally at social functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's safe anymore. " " So you did n't know him personally? " " No. " " And you did n't meet him in Emeryville about a month before his death? " " No. " He lied well, I had to give him that. " Did you know anything about Judge Reiter 's interest in young boys? " " I knew he worked extensively with youth programs. That 's all anyone really knew. Now that he 's dead, it seems cruel to speculate on anything more. " Again his execution was flawless. He was the discreet businessman, too well-bred to indulge in unseemly speculation. He would be a difficult witness. I had the feeling that he could be anything he chose to be and that no scruple would intrude to mar his performance. " Do you drive a Mercedes with Jonah T ' on the license? " " Yes, I do. A silver coupe. What does that have to do with this? " " Did you lose something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binder? " " No, I do n't think so. " He considered for a moment. " I ca n't think of anything that 's missing. " We looked at each other across his desk. I knew he was lying, and I had the feeling he knew I knew. " Who 's Jonah T? " I asked. He laughed. " A friend. I put his name on my license as a joke. " " Did he put Piper ' on his? " There was a reaction, so slight I 'd never have seen it if I had n't been watching, a tightening of the muscles around the eyes. Then he gave me his pleasant, bland smile and asked, " Can I do anything more for you? " The Oakland Hall of Justice was only a few blocks from Kohl 's p203 office. I had more than enough to point John Warren at Kohl, but I 'd promised Arthur Costa that I would n't do anything until I 'd checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Joe might have to stand trial, I 'd let Costa call the shots. The jail was also nearby, and I considered visiting Joe but decided against it. I did n't want to raise his hopes until I could nail Kohl for sure. Besides, since I 'd demanded that Molly be home by six, I wanted to be there when she got home. Traffic was impossible on the way home. A truck had spilled some white powder on the Bay Bridge earlier, and the cops had closed the bridge until they knew what it was. By the time I got there, they 'd identified it as harmless and were in the midst of cleaning it up. Those of us who got to sit and wait were not happy campers. In fact, everyone was so frustrated and grumpy by the time they finally reopened the bridge that several drivers promptly plowed into each other and snarled traffic all over again. I got home at six-fifteen, tired, short of temper, and hungry. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wine and sat down to wait for Molly. Peter got home around seven. Still no Molly. I 'd passed through irritation and was starting to worry. " She 's probably hanging out with friends and has lost track of time, " Peter said. " The friends are exactly what worries me, " I said. " And an hour is quite a bit of time to lose track of. " We had a quick dinner, and by eight, Peter was as edgy as I was. " I just have a bad feeling about this, " I said. " She knows she 's supposed to be home by six. Do you think she 's run away? " " Did you check her room? " " Nothing 's missing except what she took to school. I have a rough idea where the vampire twins hang out. I 'm going to check on them. " " Why do n't you let me do it, " Peter suggested. " You should p204 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be less hostile to me. If I do n't get anything from them, I can start checking with some kids I know and some other sources. " Peter had a lot more sources on the street than I did. It made sense for him to go, but I hated like the devil to be stuck waiting by the phone. It did n't help any that I 'd spent my afternoon with Ed Kohl. Kohl was an unnerving reminder that the dangers I 'd warned Molly about were all too real. The hands of my watch slowed down as the hour got later. I wanted Molly home, but I still did n't know what to say to her. I knew we could n't go on like this. The phone rang at nine-thirty. " Is this Catherine Sayler? " The voice was female and young, but it was n't Molly 's. " Yes. " " This is Rae. I was at your house. " " Yes? " I said, my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call you, but she 's, like, sick, and I think you should come and get her. " " Where are you? I 'll be right there. " " She said to make you promise that you would n't call the police. She did some drugs, and she 's scared you 'll turn her in. " " I wo n't call the police, and I wo n't turn her in, " I promised. " Just tell me where she is. " " We 're down near Fifth Street on Bluxome. The number is two twenty-three. It 's like this old warehouse, and you ca n't get in the front door, but there 's an alley on the side, and about halfway down, there 's this blue door. You can come in there. We 're on the second floor. " " I 'll be right down, " I said, and there was a click at the other end. p205 I hurried down to my car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Molly for putting herself and me through all this. As I drove down Divisadero, I wondered exactly what drugs Molly had been " doing, " and how sick she was. I prayed it was n't an overdose or a batch of bad stuff. At Turk, I almost missed the red light and had to brake to a stop just shy of the intersection. All I needed now was a ticket or a wreck. I resolved to be more careful. But as I turned onto Golden Gate my foot seemed to have a will of its own, and the needle on the speedometer climbed more quickly than it should have. I had to brake again at Van Ess. The red light glared down at me, stubbornly exercising its power. I realized that my breath was coming in short, shallow gasps, and made a conscious effort to take deeper, longer breaths. Usually, that calms me ; today, it simply made me more impatient. Just as I decided that the light must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civic Center and through the Tenderloin took forever, but once I hit Sixth Street, the traffic thinned, and p206 I could make decent time. at night, so I cut over to Howard. I hoped to hell that Bluxome Street was where I thought it was. I found it on the first try, and drove up the street until I found the number, then around the corner and up the alley to the blue door. The alley looked deserted. Years ago its proximity to the train yards would have made it attractive to hobos, but today 's homeless were n't railroaders, and they stayed closer to downtown. I wondered how the devil Molly and her friends had found this place. I parked just before the blue door, pulled the flashlight from the compartment on the car door, and got out. The blue door bore a faded pink notice that informed me in large letters that the building was unsafe for human occupancy. Beneath the notice, the door stood slightly ajar, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city 's warning. The door was braced with heavy crossbeams, a clear sign of earthquake damage. This area was full of brick buildings built on fill, which is about the worst combination in a quake. During the quake, a couple of them had lost their outside walls, and many more had been damaged. Some, like this one, still awaited repair or the wrecker 's ball. I pushed the door open, wedged it to keep it that way, and stepped inside. The building was a warehouse, and I was standing in a wide hall. To my left, heavy beams cross-braced an opening the size of a garage door. My flashlight illuminated only a tight circle of space. Beyond its beam was black emptiness. " Molly? " I called. A muffled moan answered me from somewhere ahead. I followed the sound. Yellow light leaked from under a door at the top of a flight of wooden stairs. I picked my way through the rubble and climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A single p207 low-watt bulb illuminated a small room. Against the opposite wall, a shapeless heap of blankets lay on an old mattress. I hurried toward them, praying I was n't too late. I pulled back the blanket to find a pile of rags and felt suddenly sick as I realized that I 'd been set up. " Hands on your head, please. " The voice was almost casual, as if the order were just a polite request, but I recognized it at once and knew that Ed Kohl was deadly serious. I did as I was told and turned slowly to face him. He stood next to a pile of boxes where he must have been hiding. He wore the same bland smile he 'd greeted me with at his office, but he was holding a gun. " Sal, " he called. The door behind me opened, and I turned to see the young man with the strawberry birthmark pushing Molly ahead of him into the room. Her hands were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been forced into her mouth as a gag. Her eyes were wide with fear. After all my worries about Molly running away, I 'd discovered that there were far worse possibilities. Kohl made a motion with his free hand, and Sal moved Molly over next to me and pushed her down onto the mattress. He handed Sal the gun, with orders to shoot me if either of us moved, then moved around behind me. " Put your arms behind you very slowly, " he said. He slid my jacket off and checked the pockets. The turtleneck and jeans I was wearing were too tight to hide a weapon, but that did n't stop him from searching for one. When he 'd finished, he stepped back and took the gun from Sal. " Why? " I asked, though I knew the answer. " Because you would n't back off, " he said. " A man in my position ca n't afford to have someone like you digging around. You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but God knows what else you might have come up with. I ca n't take that chance. " p208 " But you did kill Mitch Morrison. " " Sure. For the same reason I have to kill you. I 'm a businessman. You are a liability, so was he. " " And the judge, was he a liability, too? " " To himself, not to me. There 's no way Sam would have even admitted to knowing me, much less revealed that he knew what I did. No, he was n't a threat to me. " " Then why kill him? " " You 're asking the wrong man. I did n't kill Sam. I did n't need to. " Kohl was perfectly capable of lying, but there was n't any reason for him to. He 'd already admitted to one murder, why deny the other? " Where 's the book? " he asked. " The police have it. They found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The one Morrison stole from my office. " I did n't say, " What other book? " but my face must have revealed what I was thinking, because Kohl said, " So you have n't found it yet. Too bad. I 'd like to have it back. " " What are you going to do with us? " I asked. " Dump us behind another bar? " " No need. This neighborhood will do fine. Your niece ran away, you got into the wrong part of town looking for her. " " You better make it good, " I said, " because my ex-husband is an inspector in homicide, and no matter who does the investigation, it 's bound to be a personal friend. " " There wo n't be anything for them to find, just as there was n't in Oakland. People die all the time in a neighborhood like this. " " Not people investigating murders. Not former wives of homicide detectives. This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to look like a setup. You get Dan Walker on your trail, you 're going to wish it was only me you were dealing with. " P209 Kohl smiled broadly. " I 'm terrified, " he said. " You surprise me. I would n't have taken you for a gambler. " He was smiling, but he was also thinking, and that gave me some reason for hope. If he decided to shoot us here, it was probably all over, but if he had to take us somewhere else, there was a possibility that he 'd make a mistake and I 'd get a chance at him. " Okay, " he said. " No problem. I 've got just the place for you. We do n't have to worry about the kid, see. You 'll be glad to hear that she 's not part of this. A cute little piece like that -- what is she, twelve, thirteen? There are folks 'll pay plenty for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd have killed him right then. In cold blood. I 've learned to control fear, but the fury that surged through me pushed me right to the edge. Kohl laughed, a nasty, evil sound. " Sal 'll take care of her. But do n't worry, he 'll be real careful with her. Go on, " he ordered the other man. " You know where to take her. I 'll be there soon as I finish here. " Sal started toward us, and I waited for the moment when he 'd come between Kohl and me. With my training in aikido, I had no doubt I could take them both, but not with a gun pointed at me. I needed Sal for a shield. Just as he was about to step between us, Kohl barked out, " Do n't walk in front of her, dummy, go around behind. " With him coming in behind me, and my hands on my head, there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot. I forced myself to stand still while Sal pulled Molly up from the mattress and dragged her toward the door. For the first time, I felt truly helpless. There was n't a damn thing I could do to stop Sal, and even if I did save myself, I was n't sure I could save Molly. When they were gone, Kohl said, " We 're going to take a p210 little walk down the street, down to those buildings at the end. You 're about to become another victim of the quake. " He laughed harshly. I remembered those buildings. The entire outside walls were gone, but the interior ones remained. Metal scaffolding held the floors up. A deep trench surrounded the foundations. Kohl was right. No one would question an accident there. Kohl picked up an electric lantern with his free hand and motioned me toward the door. With only a beam of light coming from behind me, I could barely see the stairs. It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hands, but negotiating those stairs with my hands on my head was nearly impossible. Just over halfway down, I missed a step and plunged forward in the darkness. I grabbed for something to break my fall and caught hold of one of the poles supporting the handrail. Momentum threw me forward, and a wrenching pain shot through my shoulder. I let go and rolled down a couple more steps, landing hard on the floor at the bottom. Another sharp pain shot through my shoulder and the side of my face slammed against the floor. A moment later the beam of the flashlight bored into my eyes. " Get up, " Kohl said. I did n't know if I could. I was still in shock, and I could n't tell how much damage the fall had done, but as my head cleared, I made a decision. " I do n't know if I can walk. " I said. " I think I did something to my leg. " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the motions, struggling to get on my hands and knees. My left shoulder hurt like hell, and a knife of pain stabbed through my right ankle. As I started to stand I let myself fall again. " I ca n't, " I said. " I think I broke it. " Kohl hesitated. He descended the stairs and stepped behind me. I could n't see a thing except the blinding light he kept in my eyes. " Get up now, " he ordered. " I ca n't. " I tried to sound desperate. p211 " Get up or I 'll shoot you here. " I 'd hoped he 'd reach down to pull me up, but he was too smart for that. " Please do n't shoot, " I pleaded. " I 'm getting up. " I struggled and stumbled to my feet. I did n't have to fake the limp. I just accentuated what my body already wanted to do, but as I approached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that my left foot was always forward. " Keep moving, " Kohl ordered. I shuffled even slower. " Damn it, move, " he snarled. He stepped in closer and jabbed me in the back with the barrel of the gun. It was the moment I 'd been hoping for. I pivoted to my right and spun around, knocking his gun hand to the side. My right hand slid down to grab his wrist. I stepped behind him, brought my left hand around his neck and across his throat, grabbed the collar of his leather jacket and pulled hard. He struggled against the choke. I 'd missed the carotid artery. The pain in my shoulder was almost more than I could stand. I was n't going to get a second chance. I stepped back and went down on my left knee, bringing Kohl down hard. I slammed his right arm, fully extended, across my right leg. There was a pop as the elbow broke. Kohl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p212 Pain stabbed through my shoulder and ankle, and I did n't know how long I 'd have the strength to keep the pressure on Kohl 's throat. I gritted my teeth and held tight as he struggled against my arm. " Where 's my niece? " I demanded. " You want your niece ; I want my freedom. We can do busi-ness, " he croaked. I gave the arm with the broken elbow a sharp yank. He screamed. " Where is my niece? " I repeated. He made a gurgling sound, and I loosened my arm a bit. Too much pressure and I 'd choke him out. He would n't be much use to me unconscious. " Tell me, " I said, " or I 'll twist your arm off. " I gave another yank to make my point. " All right, all right, " he cried. " I 'll take you there. " " You 'll tell me where she is first, then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tightened my grip on his arm. He gave me an address on Del Norte Street. " Tell me about it. " " What do you mean? " " What kind of place is it, who 's there, what can I expect? I do n't want any unpleasant surprises. " p213 " It 's a house in the Castro, sort of a halfway house where kids hang out. Runaways. Boys. " " And where will your friend have taken Molly? " " I 've got an office in the back, on the second floor. " My arm would n't hold out much longer. I shifted my grip and increased the pressure on his carotid artery until he sagged into unconsciousness. Then I gave him a push forward onto the floor and felt around for the gun near my right foot. I 'd only have a few seconds before he regained consciousness. Even though I did n't think he was in any shape to give me problems, I wanted the gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped the lantern when I turned on him. Fortunately, it had n't broken. It lay on the floor in front of us, illuminating empty space while we remained in the dark. I picked it up and shined it in Kohl 's face. His skin was a ghostly white, whether from the light or the pain, I could n't tell. His eyes fluttered open and stared blankly at me. I shivered, aware for the first time that my back was wet with sweat. " Up, " I said. As Kohl 's head cleared, his nasty disposition returned. He swore colorfully if not imaginatively. " Get up, we 're going to get my niece, " I said. " Fuck you, " he said. " I 'm not going anywhere. " " You 're going. With or without a couple of bullet holes in you. Your choice. " He paused and blinked into the light, as if he were trying to see my face to gauge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said. " You do n't have to go there, " he said. " You could call and Sal would meet you somewhere, exchange me for Molly. That 's the safest bet. " I wanted safe, but I was n't about to let Kohl define it for me. " We 're going to my car now, " I said. " Give me any excuse at all, and I 'll shoot you. That 's a promise. " He limped ahead of me out the door. At the car I made him p214 stop and keep his good hand over his head while I opened the trunk. " The trunk? " he shouted. " You ca n't put me in the trunk. I 'll suffocate. " " I do n't think so, " I said. " I do n't like vermin in my car. Get in the trunk. " " What about my arm? " " It too. Move. " Kohl climbed awkwardly into the trunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The drive to Del Norte Street was one of the longest of my life. All I could think of was how terrified Molly must be and what appalling danger she faced. Kohl 's instructions to Sal gave me some reason to believe that she was safe for the time being, but things can go wrong. Sal could panic or she could try to escape. I tried to force my mind away from such thoughts, but fear sat heavy in my chest, compressing my lungs so it was hard to get enough breath. There was n't a lot of traffic, but every slow driver in the city seemed to be on the streets tonight and all the lights were red. I slammed on the brakes to avoid an ancient Volkswagen that pulled out right in front of me. A muffled yelp from behind reminded me that it was a rough ride in the trunk. I did n't give a damn. Kohl would n't suffocate, because Volvos have an opening from the trunk to the main compartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't a priority. I forced myself to think about how I 'd deal with Sal and the others at the house on Del Norte Street. It was risky to go in alone, without backup. If something went wrong, Molly would still be in Sal 's hands with no one to come after her. But it was even riskier to call the police. Their involvement could easily lead to a hostage situation with lots of men with guns and far too much chance that a shot might go astray. p215 I decided to call Peter. If he was home, I 'd use him for backup. If not, I could leave a message telling him where I 'd gone and why. I found the address on Del Norte. It was a two-story row house, third from the corner on a residential street a block above the commercial district. I drove past it twice to be sure I knew the layout, then looked for a parking place some distance away. I found one three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small neighborhood grocery. I needed a phone. The man behind the counter was Asian, probably Korean, an older man with tired eyes. He was obviously getting ready to close. " You all right, miss? " he asked. " Your head is bleeding. " I touched my cheek and discovered that I 'd cut it in the fall. I considered cleaning up but did n't want to take the time. Besides, this way I could claim to have had some kind of accident that required Sal 's help. " I fell, " I told the grocer. " Do you have a telephone I could use? " " There 's a pay phone over by the chips, " he said. I reached in my pocket and realized I 'd left my wallet at home when I rushed out to get Molly. The old man handed me a quarter with a look that said he had n't really expected me to have the money. I called home, hoping to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message telling him what had happened and where we were. I ended with, " If you do n't hear from me by eleven, call the police. Do n't try to go in before then. " I limped the three blocks to the address Kohl had given me, feeling every step in my aching ankle. My stomach had tied itself into one large, painful knot ; and my chest was so tight that breathing took an effort. I shivered, but the icy chill in my hands and feet had nothing to do with the cold night air. I paused in front of the house, then climbed the steps to the p216 porch and knocked on the door. The hand in my right pocket held Kohl 's gun. A boy in his early teens, in tight jeans and a white T-shirt, answered the door. " I need to see Sal, " I said. He looked at me for a moment, then said, " I think he 's upstairs. " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid stepped aside and let me enter. He did n't seem to care much about who I was or why I was there, and my disheveled appearance had n't bothered him any. I did n't have to ask directions because there was a set of stairs in the entrance hall. I climbed to the second story and walked toward the back. If Kohl had n't lied to me, the door at the end of the hall should be his office. I stood with my back to a wall and knocked. Sal opened the door. Before he could move, I said, " I have Kohl 's gun in my pocket. Just walk backwards into that room. " He did. I followed him in and closed the door behind me. Molly sat on an old couch, still bound and gagged. " Put your hands on your head, " I ordered Sal. His eyes were wide enough so you could see the white all the way around. He put his hands on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he protested. " I ai n't touched her. " " It 's a damned good thing for you, " I said. I made sure he did n't have a gun, then made him lie facedown on the floor while I removed the tape that held the gag in Molly 's mouth. " Oh, Catherine, " she gasped. I reminded myself we were n't out of this yet and kept my tone as cool as I could manage. " We 're going to be fine, Molly, but you have to keep it together till we 're out of here. Can you do that? " She nodded and bit her lip. " Good. We 're going to walk right out of here. Sal, you 're going to walk ahead of me ; Molly, you walk behind me. Be p217 careful not to get between Sal and the gun. " I untied her wrists and ankles. " Can you walk all right? " " Yes, " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hold her to me, to smooth her hair and comfort her, but this was not the time for that. I ordered Sal to get up, cross his arms in front of him, and hold his elbows as we walked out. " Be real careful not to say or do anything that might make me feel I have to shoot you, " I said. He did n't look so dangerous anymore. We must have made a strange procession, but no one stopped us as we left the house. We walked the three blocks to the car, and when we reached the corner and I could see it ahead with the trunk still closed, I began to breathe easier. At the car, I had Sal put his hands behind his back ; then I handed Molly the gun, and used my belt to tie Sal 's wrists. It 's a lot harder than you 'd think to tie someone up with a belt, and it took several tries. I was glad I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I put Sal in the backseat of the car, with another warning on the dire consequences of trying to get loose, then I gave Molly the big hug that we both needed. She clung to me but she did n't cry. " Are you all right? " I asked. " Can you go with me to the police? " She nodded. " Yes, " she said in the same small voice. I wanted to take her anywhere but a police station. She needed someplace warm and comforting where a kind, loving person would serve her tea and cookies and hold her while she cried. She needed home, but that was a long way away right now. The Hall of Justice is nearly deserted at eleven o'clock at night, but there are always people at Southern Station, just inside the p218 front door. I pulled into the red zone at the curb and walked up the front steps with my gun in my pocket, my hands in full view, and Sal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door, a cop sat behind a metal detector. Even in the daytime, this building felt cold and cavernous. At night, it was even less hospitable. Dirty yellow light spilled through the slab of bulletproof glass that separated the police station from the lobby, accentuating the gloomy darkness of the outer room. I stopped in front of the metal detector. " This man kidnapped my niece, " I said. " There 's a man in the trunk of my car who tried to kill me. I have his gun in the pocket of my jacket. " At the mention of the gun, the patrolman jumped up. He looked like he was about fifteen. He stammered for a minute and then picked up the phone and called for reinforcements. Two men in uniform hurried out of Southern Station. The older of the two was a stocky man in his early forties. He was about my height and close to twice my weight. His name tag identified him as Emile Alvarez. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun from my pocket. Everyone breathed easier when that was taken care of. " There 's a fair chance that that 's the murder weapon from an Oakland homicide about four weeks ago, " I said. " The man in my trunk confessed to being the killer, though I 'm sure he 'll deny it to you. " Alvarez escorted us into Southern Station and sent two cops to retrieve Kohl. " May I see your identification, please? " he asked. " I do n't have it with me, " I said. I was in the process of explaining who I was and why I had an injured man in my trunk when they brought Kohl in. He was pale, and his arm hung useless at his side, but it did n't slow him down any. " That woman tried to kill me! " he shouted. " She held a gun p219 on me and locked me in her trunk. I need a doctor, and I want my lawyer. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered the patrolmen to take him to the Emergency Room at SF General. " These men will take your statement at the hospital, " he said. Kohl was still protesting and threatening lawsuits as they took him out the door. " He 's a dangerous man, " I warned Alvarez. " They know he 's a homicide suspect. They 'll be careful, " he assured me. He turned to Molly. " Do you need to see a doctor? " he asked gently. Molly shook her head. " How about you? " he asked me. I shook my head. " I 'd just like to get this over with so I can get my niece home. " He had me tell him my version of the evening 's events, then he said, " The inspector will want to talk with you. " I put my arm around Molly and drew her to me. " Hang in there, " I said. " It 's going to be all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held her there. p120 We sat on hard chairs and waited for the inspector. The light seemed too bright, and the noise made my head ache. I asked to use the phone and called home. Peter was still out, so I left a message telling him that all was well and we were at Southern Station. I was almost dozing when I remembered something Kohl had said back at the warehouse, something I did n't want to forget. I 'd been so concerned with saving Molly that I 'd shoved it to the back of my mind. Now I tried to pull it up. It was a reference to a book, but not the book of photographs, another book, one Mitch had stolen from Kohl 's office. I was too tired to think as clearly as I needed to, but I sensed that book was important and I wondered why it had n't been in Mitch 's apartment or his car. He must have hidden it somewhere or given it to someone. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding. It could be connected to Mitch 's murder, and even to the judge 's. So long as Joe was still in jail, we needed to know everything we could about Samuel Reiter. p221 My thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of an attractive Asian woman in her thirties, with short black hair. She introduced herself as Inspector Lui and took us upstairs to her office. There she had Molly recount the night 's events. I learned that Kohl had enlisted a friend of the vampire twins, a boy in his late teens, to lure Molly to the warehouse. He 'd offered her a ride home and claimed he needed to drop something off on the way. The " something " turned out to be Molly. I also learned that Molly recognized Kohl as the man who had spoken to her in front of my apartment and given her a ride to Polk Street several days ago. I wondered how he 'd known where to find me ; then I remembered the business card I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see how close I 'd get. My call, or maybe my visit, had set him off. Molly described her whole ordeal with amazing composure. She was close to tears several times, but she fought them down and went on. When she apologized to me for the second time, I realized that she felt responsible for what had happened. " I should have listened to you, " she repeated. I pulled her to me and held her. " This did n't happen because of you, " I told her. " Those men were after me. They just used you. " Later, I 'd have time to reflect that the hardest part for both of us was feeling responsible for the other 's pain. Lui had Molly go back over several points. I began to relax a bit, and a wave of exhaustion and nausea hit me. The whole left side of my head throbbed. I reached up and touched it gently. The hair on that side was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it when I fell. My cheek and the inside of my mouth also hurt, my right ankle ached, and I could n't lift my left arm without a sharp stab of pain. But I would heal. It was Molly I was worried about. When Lui finished with her, I asked if I could call Marion to take her home. Molly objected so strenuously that I agreed to let her stay with me, at least for the night. p222 As we were getting started on my statement, an older man in a brown suit came in and whispered something to Lui. I recognized him a few seconds before he recognized me, so I was ready when he said, " Say, are n't you...? " " Catherine Sayler, " I said. " Hi, Bill. " Bill Stanton was one of the first police officers I 'd met when I came to San Francisco. He reached out and shook my hand with the same slightly awkward gentility that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name, but I never forget a face. You 're Dan Walker 's wife. " " Ex-wife, " I said. " We were divorced several years ago. " " Oh. " He looked genuinely distressed. " I 'm sorry to hear that. " Before I could tell him that he 'd do us both a favor if he did n't mention my presence at Southern Station to Dan, he said, " There 's a Peter Harman out front asking after you. I 'll let him know you 'll be down in a while. " I thanked Bill, and we returned to my statement. Lui had me take her through the whole evening, including breaking Kohl 's elbow. " You must be very good to have disarmed a man of his size, " she said. " I had a lot of motivation. " I did n't tell her about yanking on Kohl 's arm or that I 'd have shot him if he 'd given me any excuse at all. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the things I 'd been willing to do. It was beginning to look as if we 'd be spending the entire night at Southern Station, so I asked Lui if she could n't expedite things and let us come back down and sign the statements in the morning. I doubt she 'd have done it for me, but she could see that Molly was exhausted, so she cut some corners for us. Peter and Dan were waiting in the lobby, and both of them looked considerably the worse for wear. It 's a real ordeal for p223 those two to be in the same room together. They both work so hard at being polite that you think their faces are going to crack. " You guys look like you 're waiting at the morgue instead of Southern Station, " I said. They both jumped up, then there was an awkward moment while they waited to figure out what to do next. I went to Peter and gave him a big hug, then turned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We both needed all the hugs we could get. When I pulled away from Dan, he studied my face. " You have a nasty scrape on your cheek and the cut on your head might need stitches, " he said. The thought of going to a hospital tonight was more than I could manage. All I wanted was to get Molly home and to crawl into bed myself. The head wound was n't bleeding anymore. It could wait till tomorrow. " I just want to go home, " I told him. " Can you drive my car and leave yours here? " I asked Peter. " I do n't feel like driving. " By the time we got home, Molly could barely keep her eyes open. I tucked her into bed and stayed with her until she went to sleep. I was exhausted, but sleep was a long way off. As I sat down in the living room I began to shake uncontrollably. Peter wrapped a blanket around me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things, " I said through clenched teeth. My head throbbed, my stomach was queasy, and my heart pounded. I had held myself together through the scene at the police station and until Molly was safely tucked away, but my body was n't holding on any longer. Peter poured me some brandy and steadied my arm while I drank it. I was afraid my stomach would n't take it, but it actually helped. " Want me to build a fire? " he asked. p224 I nodded, anxious to surround myself with every possible source of comfort. When he had a fire going, he wrapped me in his arms again and held me against his chest. " Want to talk about it? " he asked. I told him the whole story. It did n't get any better for the telling. " The worst part, " I said, " was knowing what could happen to Molly. I could n't stand to think about what Kohl might do to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been uncomfortable under other circumstances. I put my head against his chest and struggled to calm the maelstrom of emotion that seethed inside me. Fear and anger were no strangers, but I 'd never felt either the way I had tonight. I could have killed Kohl in cold blood and without regret. But that was n't what bothered me. It was the intensity of my fear that haunted me. Nothing had ever frightened me like the possibility of Molly coming to harm. I 'd spent years developing the self-defense skills that allowed me to feel safe even in dangerous places, and in one night I 'd discovered an appalling vulnerability. Part of me wanted to ship Molly back to Marion immediately, but that was the same part that wanted to bolt whenever Peter got too close. I try not to listen to it. Peter 's heart beat steadily and reassuringly as I lay against his chest. I gave him a hug. " And you ended up sitting on a bench with Dan Walker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad. Walker has mellowed some. He did n't even beat me up for leaving you alone to nearly get killed. " I pulled away and looked at Peter. The lines on his face seemed to have deepened, and he looked exhausted, not just physically tired but emotionally drained. " Does n't look like he had to. I have the feeling you did the job for him. " Peter managed a rueful smile. " I keep kicking myself for not seeing that it was a setup. " " Right, you should have seen it, even though I did n't. Is p225 that ' cause you 're a man or just because you 're supposed to be smarter than I am? " " Oh God. " Peter moaned. " Now you 're going to beat on me. " p226 The next morning complaints from various parts of my body indicated that I 'd done more damage than I 'd realized on my trip down the stairs. A number of ugly bruises had blossomed during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark blue camellia. My head throbbed dully, and the scalp wound had opened again while I slept, leaving the pillow looking like something for the police lab. The blood disturbed Molly, who 'd ended up in our bed when the nightmares struck. It was reassuring to have her body cuddled tight against me, but it also made sleeping difficult, and I crawled out of bed at seven feeling exhausted and miserable. My first effort to move my arm told me that a visit to the doctor was definitely in order. But the worst thing I had to face was n't the physical pain. It was the knowledge that I had to call Marion, and I had to do it soon before she heard about the evening 's escapades somewhere else. The call lived up to my worst fears. When you have to start out by reassuring a mother that her child is alive and uninjured, you 're in trouble. Marion 's voice rose to a shrill screech, and the pain in my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p227 story she heard. She vacillated between concern for Molly and fury at me. " I 'll be up to get her immediately, " she informed me. " I think it 'd be better if I brought her down, " I said. " I do n't think you want to run into a bunch of reporters, and that 'll be a real possibility here. " As I 'd expected, Marion was n't anxious to meet the media. She accepted my offer with a comment about Leonard having a reputation to uphold in the community. It struck me that Leonard 's reputation was a heavy burden to lay on Molly 's back. Peter watched me stumble around the kitchen, favoring my right leg and trying not to move my left arm. " I think you 'll need me to drive you and Molly to Palo Alto, " he said. " Palo Alto? " Molly howled. " I do n't want to go home. Please, last night you said I could stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can, " I said. " But that 's Marion 's decision. I do n't have any legal right to keep you here unless she agrees to it. " " I wo n't go back, " she said stubbornly. " She ca n't make me. " She 's worried about you, " I said. " And given what happened last night, she has good reason to think that I 'm not a good person for you to live with. " Molly fussed and moaned while we ate breakfast. I called Jesse and gave him the short version of the night 's adventures. He had more questions than the police, but he did n't get much satisfaction since I needed to cut the conversation short so I could call my doctor. I reached her as soon as the office opened and managed to talk her into working me in first thing. The phone rang again almost as soon as I 'd hung up. It was Arthur Costa. " I hear you had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How? " " Your reporter, Kevin Doyle, called. He 's most anxious to reach you. " Of course he was. He and a couple of dozen other reporters, probably. I 'd better get away before they found me. I gave Costa an abbreviated description of the night 's misadventures. " Do you think Ed Kohl killed Samuel Reiter? " he asked. " I do n't know, " I said. " He did n't confess to it, but he 's a great candidate if he ca n't come up with an alibi. " " The police will no doubt question him today. We should know soon whether they have enough to charge him. In the meantime, you can expect to be popular with the press. Be careful what you say. " Costa gave me a telephone number for Doyle. " Make sure he knows how this ties in with the Reiter case, " he said. I put off calling Doyle until I got to the doctor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway, and I did n't want to be home when the members of the fourth estate found my address. Doyle had gotten the story from the police reporter, and he was most anxious for the details, but his first question was, " Are you and your niece all right? " I was beginning to understand why Joe liked him so much. I told him some of what had happened, then said, " Look, Molly and I really do n't want a lot of publicity. Is there any way we can keep a fairly low profile on this? " " It 's going to be hard, " Doyle said, " but maybe I can help. The story can be played several ways. Obviously, everyone 's going to love the **54;27;TOOLONG angle, but I think I can persuade my editor that the real story should focus on Kohl as sex merchant to the rich and powerful. I know that will appeal to him, and in that version, you slip from paragraph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop a few comments around my colleagues. If I play it right, they 'll all believe they figured it out for themselves. But you have to promise to give me the whole story, especially anything that ties into the Reiter case. " " Absolutely, " I said. " I 'll call as soon as I get back from Palo Alto. " I turned to find my doctor watching from her office door. Her forehead was creased with a frown. " I 'm sorry to keep you waiting, " I said. " I did n't mean for that conversation to take so long. " " If you 're going to go one-on-one with killers and kidnappers, you 'll need more than a GP, " she said. " Come on in, and let 's see how much damage you 've done to yourself. " Mary has a sharp tongue but a gentle touch. I stay with her because she takes me seriously. If I say there 's a problem, she keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to look too hard. The problem with my shoulder was a bad sprain, which was a whole lot less serious than some of the other possibilities. She put me in a sling and gave me an ice pack for it. " I do n't suppose you take painkillers, " she said. " I 'm careless, not a masochist, " I said. " Of course I take painkillers. " She gave me a couple of prescriptions, one to reduce the inflammation, the other for the pain, and ordered me to get them filled in the pharmacy downstairs. " Now, " she said as I walked out the door, " not when it 's convenient, but now. " She need n't have worried. I was anxious to do anything that would delay my meeting with Marion. Both the pharmacist and the officers at Southern Station were unusually efficient. I got my pills and signed last night 's statement in less than an hour. The traffic to Palo Alto was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of Marion 's. The p230 Cape Cod house with its immaculate yard had the " right " address in the " right " town. It was equipped with all the " right " things. No wonder Molly did n't feel that she fit. I suggested that Peter stay in the car. My sister does not bring out the best in me, and I did n't want an audience for our encounter. " I 'd feel like I was driving the getaway car, " he complained. " Besides, you could use some moral support. " He climbed out of the car and followed me in. I had n't gone into a lot of detail with Marion, so she was n't prepared to see me looking like I 'd lost a fight with the Hell 's Angels. " Catherine, " she gasped when she opened the door. " You did n't tell me you were hurt. " Then she glimpsed Molly behind me, and I stepped aside so she could give her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm hug, and Marion had tears running down her cheeks when Molly finally pulled away. Leonard was waiting in the living room. He 's stiff and a bit standoffish under the best of circumstances, and today he was almost frozen. Even before we sat down, Molly said, " I do n't want to come home. I want to stay with Catherine. " Marion 's face clouded. " Now, listen here... " I put up my hand and said, " Whoa, back up. I know you two love each other, but you sure keep it a well-hidden secret. " They both stared at me. " We scared your mother badly, " I said to Molly. " She acts angry, but she 's really scared because she ca n't stand to think of what could have happened to you. Tell her, Marion. " Marion stuttered. She did n't seem to know what to say. " Of course I love you, and I was worried sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have started to work. They should have given each other a big hug, resolved their differences, and lived happily ever after. They did n't. Marion said some of the right things, and Molly started to p231 relax and look like she was n't under attack, then Marion took a dig at me, and I could n't resist responding in kind. I showed all the restraint of a ten-year-old, and the fourteen-year-old sprang to my defense. Before long, she and Marion were screaming at each other again. Even with a hefty dose of painkiller coursing through my veins, I could n't take the noise. I sank down on the couch, and Peter, sensing the need for reinforcements, stepped forward and took Molly by the shoulders. It was an act of reckless courage, like breaking up a cat fight. He could easily have been slashed by both of them. " Your mother and Catherine need to talk, " he said. " Let 's go for a walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her gently toward the door. " Let 's go for a walk, " he repeated in a tone usually reserved for much bigger, tougher people. With Molly gone, Marion collapsed into a chair. She did n't look a lot better than I felt. Leonard kept standing there looking uncomfortable and trying to figure out how to take charge. He started to say something, and Marion interrupted. " Leonard, honey, " she said with the same phony sweetness she used to use on our parents, " could you give Catherine and me a few moments to talk? " Leonard was delighted. He fled to the back of the house. Then to my surprise, Marion began to cry. She does n't do that often, so I was n't sure how to respond. " I do n't know, " she said, blowing her nose. " I 've done everything I could with Molly, and she seems to hate me. We were so close when she was younger, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same room with me. I 've been scared to death she 'd do something foolish and get herself hurt. I just do n't know what to do with her. " " She 's working on a hefty case of teenage rebellion, " I said, reflecting that my mother could testify to my expertise in that area. " And she feels like she does n't fit in here. " p232 " She does n't try to fit in, " Marion complained. " In fact, just the opposite -- she dresses wrong, hangs out with the wrong kids. She makes a point of not fitting in. " It always amazes me that some people, my sister included, see right and wrong as social rather than ethical concepts, but Marion and I had had that argument before. " I think she may fit in better in the city, " I said. " She seems to get along all right with the kids at school, and after last night, I think the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay with me. " Marion considered it and, to my surprise, agreed without an argument. " Do you think she 'd spend the weekend here? " she asked almost timidly. " Leonard could bring her back up Sunday night. " Molly had cooled down when Peter brought her back, and seemed pleased both by the agreement that she could continue to live with me and by her mother 's invitation to spend the weekend. As we were preparing to leave I asked Marion the question I did n't want an answer to. " Did you call Mother about this? " She shook her head vehemently. " No. I do n't run to Mother with every problem, you know. " It was the first time I could remember her missing a chance to snitch on me. Maybe there was hope for my baby sister after all. p133 I returned to my office with some trepidation and was grateful to see no sign of TV crews as I drove up the street. But my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the expression on Jesse 's face that we had a more serious problem than the media. " Joe 's been attacked, " he said. " Call Arthur Costa. " " What happened? " " His cellmate went after him. Arthur says the cops claim he was n't hurt, but it does n't sound good. " I got through to Costa right away. He 'd been in Oakland to see Joe. " It 's not as bad as I 'd feared, " he reported. " Joe 's not seriously hurt, and he 's in a cell by himself now, but it could have been very bad indeed. " He explained that Joe 's cellmate, the 7-Eleven killer, had taken offense at something Joe had said or done, and slammed him against the wall a couple of times. " This is exactly the kind of thing we were afraid of, " he said. " I do n't know if it was random chance that Joe drew a raging lunatic for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but if the guard on duty had n't been paying attention, Joe could be dead now. " p234 I told myself that Costa was exaggerating the danger, but the tightness in my chest and heaviness in my stomach were truer indicators of what I really believed. It 's too damned easy to die in jail. Costa continued, " The jails are crowded. I do n't know how long they 'll keep Joe separated. I certainly hope they find evidence linking Kohl to Reiter 's murder. " I hoped so, too. But I knew we 'd better not count on it. I needed to find Kohl 's missing book, but as soon as I was off the phone, Amy brought me a stack of messages from more reporters than I 'd have thought we had in this town. I 'd have dumped them all in the trash, but I was n't about to give up any opportunities to suggest a connection between Kohl and Reiter 's death. I called Kevin Doyle first. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your voracious colleagues are calling on the phone instead of staking out my office, " I said. " I think I can safely accept credit for directing their attention elsewhere, " he said. " I 'll be right over so you can tell me the whole thing in person. I can also help you figure out which of those calls you need to return. " " Give me thirty minutes, " I said. " I 've got to take care of something else first. " If Mitch had stolen Kohl 's book, I had a good idea where I might find it. The problem would be getting my hands on it. I called Steve Marley. My activities of the night before would probably provide his division with enough material for several months. He was ebullient when he came on the phone. " We busted the house where you found Molly, " he said. " Kohl kept an office there, and we seized boxes of papers. We 've got enough to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder charge. " I told Marley about the other book. He gave a low whistle. p235 " It fits, " he said. " We have n't found much dealing with money or his personal finances, and the stuff we have uses codes instead of real names. A man in Kohl 's business has plenty of dirt on his customers. I ca n't believe that he did n't keep more than we 've found. That book could make very interesting reading. " I wanted to help Marley, but I was far more interested in getting Joe out of jail. Right now the book looked like my best chance of doing that. " I might be able to get it for you, but I need some help. I need to borrow your most lurid example of the kind of photograph we found at Mitch 's apartment. Something really shocking that would get to a former victim. " " I have some pictures from previous cases. I suppose I could lend you one. You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I need to get someone 's attention. " In California, an investigator can no longer get the address of a citizen from the Department of Motor Vehicles. It used to be that all you needed was a license number, and for a small fee, you could get information on the owner of the plates, but after one careless PI delivered the address of an actress to a deranged fan who subsequently killed her, the DMV has made that information off-limits. Off-limits to investigators. Not off-limits to those working for insurance companies. I have a cozy relationship with a firm that occasionally needs my services for corporate fraud cases. They were only too happy to get me Mel R. 's real name and address. Mel was n't happy to see me when I showed up at the door of his basement apartment that evening. It took him a minute to figure out who I was, and my battered appearance probably slowed down his door-slamming reflexes. I got my foot in the door and stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his face. p236 " Just a reminder of what we 're talking about here, " I said. " Have you really shut down so tight that you ca n't feel anything for those kids? " " What do you know about it? " he exploded. " And who the hell are you to talk to me about abuse? " " I 'm the one who damn near got killed last night because the man Mitch stole that book from was looking for it. " He looked at me with dawning comprehension. " Come on inside, " he said. He watched me warily as I stepped into the room. It was scrupulously neat and rather Spartan, as if physical comfort and worldly goods were not of great concern to its occupant. In the corner a portable television set was tuned to the evening news and male and female pretty faces chatted with studied animation. Mel walked over and hit a switch and the screen went blank. " You were the one involved in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and the man who tried to kill my niece and me is the one who killed Mitch. " " I did n't know his name, " Mel said. " I did n't make any connection to Mitch. " " The police think he was a big-time operator. I think his records are in the book Mitch stole, the one he gave to you. " Mel did n't try to feign ignorance. " How did you know? " he asked. " Because you were the only one he 'd have given it to. The only one he trusted enough. He knew that you 'd been a victim, just as he had. I 'd guess that 's why he chose you for his sponsor ; he thought you 'd succeeded in putting it behind you. " Mel nodded. " But I was n't the right one for him. He really needed someone to help him get vengeance, and I was never into that. I believe that you have to find forgiveness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Is that why you did n't give me the book? " p237 " I do n't know. I did n't see that it would do any good, and it might have done harm. I guess it did harm, anyway. I 'm sorry. " " I do n't know what that book contains, but I think Kohl killed Mitch to keep whatever 's in it secret. If you hide the book, Kohl succeeds. And the people involved in this "? I held out the photograph again? " are safe to continue what they 're doing. I ca n't believe you want that. " Mel shook his head. " No, you 're right. There 's a difference between forgiveness and irresponsibility. I 'll get it for you. " He went into the next room and returned after a minute with an old, black loose-leaf binder filled to overflowing with papers. " This is what Mitch gave me. He was afraid it might be stolen from his place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeming conscious of the move, wiped his hands on his pants. Kohl 's missing book did more to take my mind off the pain in my shoulder than Mary 's little pills. I brought it home to Peter like a new toy, and we laid it out on the kitchen table and began going through it. Even a brief inspection told us that it would take days to decipher. Jesse was only too happy to come over when he heard what we had. We spent the entire evening trying to make sense of Kohl 's nearly illegible handwriting. It was enough to convince me that penmanship should be a required subject in all schools. Jesse went home around eleven, taking a section of the book with him. I did n't expect him to get much done over the weekend since he 'd informed me his lady love was returning from a business trip on Saturday. On the other hand, with Molly out of the apartment, it was possible that Peter and I would be less productive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved from the kitchen p238 table to the living room when Jesse left. Peter put the Dead on the stereo, and we snuggled on the couch ; at least we came as close to snuggling as my arm would allow. " So what did the doc say about your arm? " Peter asked. " It 's a bad sprain. She advised against rolling down stairs and suggested that I avoid people like Kohl in the future. " " Good advice. How careful do you have to be with it? " " You mean, do we have to give up our favorite activity? " " That was a general question, but if you choose to interpret it as a sexual solicitation, far be it from me to correct you. " " It seems the sort of question that would require empirical examination, " I said. " I just love it when you get empirical, " Peter said with a grin. During the weeks of Molly 's visit, sex had taken on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teenager in my parents ' house. There was a delicious freedom in knowing we had the whole house to ourselves, though making love with a sprained shoulder requires a certain amount of careful choreography. I was stiff and sore Saturday morning, and if anything I looked worse than I had the day before. The discomfort just fed my desire to unlock the secrets in Kohl 's book. One section appeared to be written in some kind of code, and we decided to start there. The first column contained entries of two, and in a few cases three, capital letters. One set was SR. I hoped that stood for Samuel Reiter. Following each set of letters were other notations, often with dates. It might as well have been written in Arabic. Kevin Doyle called at two o'clock to tell us that the Oakland police had charged Ed Kohl with the murder of Mitch Morrison, but not with that of Samuel Reiter. It seems that the night of Reiter 's death Kohl had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been seen by any number of upstanding citizens. The news was a sharp disappointment. Though I 'd been fairly sure that Kohl had n't killed Reiter when he denied it to me at the warehouse, I 'd hoped that the police would charge him with it. I 'd have been only too happy to let Kohl take Joe 's place in jail. With Kohl eliminated as a suspect, we were worse off than we 'd been before the warehouse confrontation. Joe was still the prime suspect, and we had nothing to point the police in a different direction. Joe could n't command a private cell for long in the crowded jail, and his next cellmate might be even more dangerous and violent than the previous one. Kohl 's book looked increasingly like our only hope, so Peter and I spent a frustrating weekend trying to make sense from its entries. On Sunday we took it to the copy shop and copied the entire thing ; then I played the good citizen and delivered it to the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kohl arrest was still page-one news. The San Francisco Police had found information among Kohl 's papers that led them to a brothel that specialized in underage girls. The story got bigger headlines than the national news. Page three carried Kevin Doyle 's interview of the madam, and it was one of the more troubling pieces I 'd read in a while. The woman pointed out she had n't stolen the girls from a convent. " Everyone is so offended by the idea of these girls selling sex, but no one gives a damn when they 're starving on the street or being raped in a back alley. If the churchmen and the politicians care so much for these girls, where 's the money to take care of them? " It 's damned uncomfortable to find yourself agreeing with a woman who prostitutes young girls. I called Kevin and complimented him on the story. " It 's terrific. Pulitzer material, " I said. " The worst part is that she 's right, " Kevin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is n't one major social program that serves kids that has n't been cut during the last ten years. It 's easier to get money for prisons than for schools. " I 'd never heard him so bitter. In fact, I was always amazed at how upbeat he could be while covering such painful subjects. " Sounds like this story is getting to you, " I said. " Oops, you caught me on my soapbox, " he said. " I 'll climb down if you 'll have lunch with me. " I agreed and he asked, " What 's happening in the Reiter case? Any other leads at all? " " Maybe. Take me to lunch, and I 'll tell you a story. " P241 The mail arrived around eleven and Amy handed me an envelope with no return address. " Looks like it might be personal, " she said. A single sheet of white typing paper fell out when I slit open the envelope. On a manual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you care about your niece 's health, stay away from Samuel Reiter 's death. " I stared at the note, and Amy stared at me. " Leave everything on my desk just the way it is. Do n't touch a thing, " I said. " I 'm going to Molly 's school to pick her up, then we 'll call the police. " All the way to Molly 's school I told myself that she was n't in danger yet. My mysterious correspondent wanted to scare me off, not to hurt Molly. Surely they 'd wait to see the effect of the warning before taking further action. Emotions set little store by logic, and the rest of my body paid little attention to my head. My heart speeded up, my mouth went dry, and I felt exactly as I had on the drive to the warehouse. Phoenix School had its temporary headquarters in the basement of a church about twelve blocks away. I left the car by a hydrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried down the hall I could hear Molly 's voice from a room up ahead. There was no fear in it, but it had a serious, thoughtful quality that I had n't heard a lot lately. " Well, I do n't think the Trojan p242 War was Helen 's fault. She was just an excuse. These guys did n't give a shit about women. They slaughtered them and traded them around like baseball cards. You ca n't tell me the war had anything to do with love. " A thin boy with a reedy voice began to object, but I did n't hear his argument. I leaned against the wall and took several deep breaths before I entered the room. I 'd forgotten that I still looked like recent road kill, but the kids ' surprised expressions reminded me immediately. " I need to take Molly out of school early, " I told Gil. Molly looked confused, but she gathered her things. One of the girls reached out to give her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked as we headed for the car. I told her about the note. " Wow, " she said. " You mean that there 's someone else, someone besides those guys at the warehouse? " " I 'm afraid so, " I said. I took Molly back to my office and called the police. Then I called Peter. Both got there about the same time. The police took the note as seriously as I had. They bagged it for the lab and questioned both Molly and me about any strangers we 'd seen around the apartment or her school. Neither of us had seen anything. " I 'd like to be able to assign an officer to watch her, " the investigator said, " but we 're shorthanded, and I ca n't do that. " I 'm not overly impressed by the deterrent power of one bored police officer following you around, perhaps because I can think of several ways I 'd get past that officer. " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't want this guy to have any idea where she might be. " " Not home, " Molly wailed. p243 " Definitely not home, " I said. " It would n't take much to find you there. " " Your parents? " Peter suggested. " No, that 's still too easy. Would you take her to the cabin? " Peter owns a cabin in the Santa Cruz mountains. No one would connect it with me, and it is n't a place you 're likely to meet someone accidentally. " That 'd be neat, " Molly said. " I love the cabin. " The cabin is a lot less " neat " in the cold and wet of April than in the warmth of summer, but I did n't tell her that. Peter frowned. " It 's a good place for Molly, but I 'd rather be closer to home. You could use someone to watch your back. " " It 's not my back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Peter, sending her with you is the only way I 'll feel she 's safe. " It took more grumbling on Peter 's part and the promise that I 'd use Jesse for backup and not go off on my own, but in the end he agreed to take Molly to the cabin. The police officer issued the required warnings about keeping doors locked and calling if I saw or heard anything suspicious, then departed. Once he was gone, Peter said, " I can take off work for two or three days, maybe four, if you 'll do some work at the courthouse for me. That 'll give you time to figure out where to send Molly till this is over. This could go on for months, you know. " I knew that. I did n't think I could stand months of worrying every minute about whether a killer might be after Molly, and I sure as hell was n't going to let Joe down. I had to find a way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd completely forgotten that I 'd arranged to have lunch with Kevin. He arrived at my office just as I was saying good-bye to Peter and Molly. I wanted to wrap the two of them in my arms and hang on for dear life, but I forced myself to let go p244 after a quick hug. I bit back the temptation to issue lists of instructions and warnings and tried to keep our parting light. Peter made no such attempt. " For godssake, be careful, " he said as he left. Kevin and I had lunch at a little place just off Fillmore that has great homemade soup, and while we ate I told him about the note and Kohl 's book. " Have you any idea at all who sent the note? " he asked. " None. It makes me think that I must be closer to the killer than I realize. There must be some evidence out there that the killer thinks I have or he 's afraid I 'll find, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " " But what? " " I wish I knew. I suspect it has something to do with Kohl 's book. I spent a good part of the weekend going over it, and I kept a copy I made after I turned the original over to the police. I have n't found a list of names, but he was clearly keeping some sort of accounts. Marley 's pretty sure he 'll have a list of clients somewhere. I 'm hoping it 'll lead us to a good suspect. " " Another pedophile, like Reiter, " Kevin suggested. " I 've heard something -- unfortunately, I ca n't reveal the source? from a guy who knew both Kohl and Reiter. He says that Reiter was n't the only one in the criminal justice system who was into kids. Reiter had a friend -- he thinks it was someone important? who also liked boys. " " Did he tell you anything about this friend? " Kevin shook his head. " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends. " I thought of Reiter 's diaries. K. was the only adult friend that Reiter had mentioned, and I assumed K. stood for Kohl. But other friends might have appeared in other diaries. " I wish I 'd read all the way through Reiter 's diaries, " I said. " Reiter kept diaries? " " Yes, Art Costa should be able to inspect them. They were p245 hidden on Reiter 's boat. Marley took me with him once when he went through that stuff. " " Wow, what else did they find? " Kevin 's avid enthusiasm reminded me that he was still a reporter and always on the lookout for a good story. " Down, boy, " I said. " Sorry, " he said. " I could n't help thinking what a great story the diaries might make. What else did they find? " " The only other thing I saw was a bunch of photos of the kids Reiter had molested. " I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freckle-faced kids trying to pretend that nothing unusual was going on. " They all looked so young and vulnera-ble, " I said. " It was a vivid reminder of how many kids he abused. " Kevin nodded soberly. " After Kohl 's trial, I 'd like to try to see those diaries. It 's a story that needs to be told, you know. " " I know, but right now I 'm more interested in Joe 's story. Will you see if you can get anything more out of your source? " " Of course, and I 'd also like to help you run down stuff from the book. I 'm not worth much as a bodyguard, but the killer 's less likely to try something when there are two of us. Besides, you look like you could use some help with driving for a couple of days. " I did n't feel that I needed a bodyguard, but the idea of having a driver appealed to me. My arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ankle to step on the brake, and driving to Molly 's school and back had taken its toll. I accepted Kevin 's proposal with enthusiasm. " One of the things we 've gleaned from Kohl 's book is a list of properties, " I said. " How about taking a look at the actual buildings that go with the addresses? " The first was a two-story building just off Clement. Four buzzers beside the front door indicated that it was divided into flats. The only one that answered was for the downstairs apart- p246 ment on the right. Its occupant was a woman in her midthirties who was working at home but agreed to talk to us for a few minutes. She knew nothing about her landlord except that she mailed checks to Pacific Coast Properties in Oakland. She gave us the address. It was Kohl 's. The other tenants were all young professionals, and it did n't seem like we had anything, until she complained about George Gillespie 's nephews. Gillespie lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but she always knew when he had his nephews over because they made so much noise. The boys were about eight or nine, and sometimes they brought friends. They visited several times a week. Under any other conditions, we 'd have taken the story at face value, but given the landlord, you had to wonder about those nephews, especially when it came out she never saw Gillespie in the morning. " It sounds almost like he does n't really live here, " I said, " like he just visits in the afternoon. " " At the rent they charge on this place? Why would anyone do that? " she asked. I did n't think she 'd really want to know. " Nice setup, " Kevin said as we got back in the car. " A guy wants a pad where he can entertain boys, but he does n't want to put it in his own name. Kohl provides it, no doubt at something above market rents. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent, and everybody 's happy. " " The SFPD should be very interested in these addresses, " I said, " and maybe somewhere in the list of guys they pick up, we 'll find one who knew Samuel Reiter. " " Let 's check out the whole list, " Kevin suggested. " You never know what else we might find. " His blue eyes sparkled with excitement, and his fingers drummed on the steering wheel. p247 " You really love this kind of work, do n't you? " He smiled, a wide, toothy, boyish grin. " I live for it, " he said. " The most fun I ever had was working stories on the IRA. It was like being in the middle of a spy movie. In the end, it turned out to be more talk than action, but there was one guy who really was hooked in to the IRA, and had been collecting money and acting as a courier for them for several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man here, and we had to smuggle him out of the country. It was great fun. Robbie Quinn was his name. The U.S. wanted to extradite him, but the Irish authorities never could seem to find him. " Kevin gave me a wink and laughed. As we headed back downtown, he said, " There 're a lot of Irish out on the Avenues now, but in the old days we all lived south of the slot. You know what that means? " " No, " I said. " South of the cable car slot, meaning south of Market. Before the twenties the Irish could n't live north of the slot. That 's why the Mission and the Castro had big Irish populations. They were south of the slot. " San Francisco was a big Irish city. Most of the men ended up as cops and in other middle-level jobs. The best never made it to the work force. Soon as the Jesuits spotted them, they were headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franciscans to be turned into good citizens. That 's why there were so few great Irish leaders here. The bright ones ended up as priests. " It took only a little prompting to get Kevin spinning tales of the Irish in San Francisco. He was a natural storyteller with a healthy shot of stand-up comic and a mockingbird 's ability to mimic voices. People I 'd known only as names in the newspaper came alive as he described their quirks and foibles and imitated their speech. The afternoon went swiftly in his company, and I was grateful to him for making an unpleasant job enjoyable. We checked p248 out addresses all over the city, total score : two more apartments that may have been rented to pedophiles and a house that neighbors described as being like the local boys ' club. The other places seemed to be legitimate real estate holdings ; no sinister purpose we could discern. Maybe the police would have more luck. p249 Kevin and Jesse and I spent a lot of time together over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kohl 's book. When you 're trying to catch a thief, it helps to think like one, and we quickly discovered that Kevin had a certain native talent for that sort of thing. " You have a truly devious mind, " Jesse said in response to one of Kevin 's more creative suggestions. It was a high compliment. I kept a close watch for anyone suspicious in my neighborhood, but either he was very good or he was n't sticking close. Kevin loved being a bodyguard. If I had n't grown so fond of him, I would n't have put up with his chivalric nonsense. Peter agreed to stay an extra day with Molly if we did some research for him at the courthouse. There were a number of things we needed to check in connection with Ed Kohl, so Jesse volunteered to take care of both assignments. It was a real concession for him to go to the courthouse since he was a firm believer that anything worth knowing was available on computer. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bugging him for a week to go to the courthouse to check on Anton Glosser. p250 Kevin and I spent the day puzzling over the book without noticeable success. Jesse called at four and I could tell he was excited. He did n't want to blow his image as cool, so he restrained himself from whooping, and said simply, " I 've got something very interesting for you. Be over after I check a couple more things. Oh, you probably want to send Kevin home before I get there. " An hour and a half later, when he finally arrived, I was just past dying of curiosity and headed for deeply annoyed. " So? " I said. " What did you get? " " Well, first I learned that technology does indeed have its limits. You were right about the value of going to the courthouse to check documents. " I love to be right, especially in an argument with Jesse, but tonight I just wanted to know what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do n't get to the point, " I said. " Okay, here 's what I did n't get from the computer files. Ed Kohl 's lawyer is Milton Diesman. The same Milton Diesman whose name popped up in your investigation of Anton Glosser. Diesman 's name is all over Kohl 's investments, but only on a couple of Glosser 's. Care to guess which ones? " " The two we 've had such trouble tracking and, of course, the one with Diesman as a general partner. " " You got it, but it gets better. " Jesse could n't hide his glee. " The house where they took Molly was owned by West Coast Properties, which is owned by a limited partnership with Ed Kohl as the general partner. And guess who is one of the limited partners in this little company. " " Not Anton Glosser. " " The very same. " I let out a low whistle. What a stroke of luck! We 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kohl connection we would n't have known what it meant. I wondered about the connection between Kohl and Glosser. It could be Diesman. The lawyer probably helped Kohl find p251 investors for his ventures, and Glosser would have been a natural choice. But it could be a far darker connection. Anton Glosser could be a pedophile. I went back to the book, to the coded section we thought held the names of Kohl 's clients. There was no A.G. listed. We checked the full list of people who were members of Kohl 's various limited partnerships. About a third of them matched sets of initials in the book. " We need more information, " I said. " We wo n't get anything from Diesman. Did you get names of notaries? " Jesse consulted his notes. " Yep, and we 're in luck. The papers for West Coast Properties and most of the others were notarized by a Jules Valdo. He probably works for Diesman. " " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " " And then? " " Glosser is either a pedophile, in which case I 'll happily help Steve Marley build a case to send him to jail, or he 's simply an investor who did n't ask too many questions about why he was making such a good return on his money. In that case, I imagine that he 's very nervous about the possibility that word will get out of his connection to the house on Del Norte Street. " " As well he might be, " Jesse said. The news about Glosser was exciting, but it did n't get me any closer to Reiter 's killer and the man or men who threatened Molly. If the book had n't yielded an answer in two days, it could be weeks before we broke its codes. Weeks of worrying about Molly and rearranging both Peter 's and my lives, weeks of feeling like a sitting duck. I was n't about to put up with that. I needed a way to provoke the killer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know he was headed my way than to have to wonder where he was. The first step was to get Molly safely out of the picture. p252 Sending her to any of my relatives meant fessing up to my parents about a number of things. Marion did n't want to explain why Molly was living with me, and I did n't want to explain how I 'd almost gotten us both killed. It was a story better told in the past tense, when it was really over and they did n't have to worry about how it was going to end. It was time to call in a favor, and the person who came to mind was Corinne Case, a longtime friend and former employee who now lived and worked in Boise. " Casey " had teenagers of her own, so she was familiar with their rituals and strange behavior. From stories she 'd told me on the phone, Molly would fit right in with her brood. Casey was delighted to help. She 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told her I needed a babysitter more than a backup person and promised to give her a call the next time something exciting came up. She described the cases she was working ; they sounded wonderfully dull. Peter liked the plan a lot less than Casey did. He whined and fussed and complained about me acting as bait for a killer. He made the whole thing sound a lot more dramatic and dangerous than it really was. Finally, I told him just to put Molly on the plane to Boise, in either Oakland or San Jose, and we could fight about it when he got home. I spent the evening planning my strategy. If I was going to be the bait, I was sure as hell going to call the shots. That meant setting the whole thing up before I let either Jesse or Peter get involved. The next morning I called Kevin Doyle before I left for work. I knew that Kevin loved a good scam and wanted to help Joe. That made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I wanted to do. " What I need is something that will make the killer think I 'm about to deliver incriminating evidence to the police, " I told him. p253 " A newspaper story, " Kevin said. " That could be very useful. " " A newspaper story in which sources close to the defense complain that the police are not pursuing the case vigorously enough and indicate that an unnamed private investigator has evidence implicating a secret associate of the judge 's. How 's that sound? " " Terrific. I do n't want this to drag on. Can you suggest that this evidence will be delivered to the police in the next three days? " " Sure, whatever you want. Pardon me for asking, but is n't this a bit dangerous? " " It could be, but I do n't think the killer is a pro, and I 'll have Peter and Jesse watching my back. " " It 's your show, " he said. " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Joe 's attorney will back you up. And you can expect th? cops to be on your case. " The killer, I thought, will be the least of my worries. Costa did n't like the plan. It was risky. It could cause trouble with the police. It was n't the way things were done. I pointed out that standard procedure had gotten us nowhere and was likely to continue taking us there. This was by far the most promising approach we had. Finally, Costa agreed that he 'd go along with the plan for four days. He did n't say what he 'd do at the end of that time, but I had the feeling the killer 'd better be in custody or he 'd hand me my head. Next, I called the law offices of Milton Diesman and asked for Jules Valdo. A secretary with a voice that could cut glass informed me Mr. Valdo no longer worked there. She did not know where I could find Mr. Valdo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a common name. There was only one Jules Valdo in the phone book. He was n't at home but his wife was, and she was happy to give me his office number. p254 Valdo worked as a paralegal for a firm I 'd once dealt with on a case. It was a definite step up from Diesman on the respectability scale. I offered to buy him lunch. He accepted. Jules Valdo was a smallish man with a pinched mouth and a crease between his brows. He looked like he could do the " before " segment of an Excedrin commercial. His voice had n't prepared me for his pinched appearance. It was rich and mellifluous, the kind that ought to go with a cleft chin and lazy smile. " You wanted to see me about Mr. Diesman? " he said as soon as I 'd introduced myself. No social pleasantries, no meandering around to get to the point. " Yes, " I said. " I understand you used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes, " he said warily. The tone was so odd, so guarded. I felt like the grand inquisitor or maybe a representative of the IRS. " Why did you leave Mr. Diesman? " I asked. " I was not altogether comfortable with some of his prac-tices, " Valdo said. I did n't hop up and do a little dance around the table, but that 's sure what my spirits were doing. An unhappy employee is almost as good as an ex-wife when you want to know the dirt. And it turned out that Mr. Valdo did know plenty of dirt. He 'd watched Diesman and Kohl put together a number of deals. " I did n't know exactly what was going on until I read those articles about Ed Kohl, " he said. " But I could tell just from the way they talked and the way that things were structured that these were not legitimate businesses. And I do n't mean that they were highly speculative. That 's just it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate, good solid properties that should have been a straightforward investment. Yet they were looking for investors who wanted a fat return and would n't p255 ask too many questions. That 's what I heard Kohl say more than once, no questions asked. ' " I told Valdo about West Coast Properties and the house on Del Norte Street. He shook his head in disgust. " It does n't surprise me, " he said. " Not really. I knew there was something going on. " " Do you remember a man named Anton Glosser? " I asked. " He was one of the limited partners on that deal. " Valdo shook his head. " Glosser is a large man, maybe six two and big boned, not really fat, just large. He has blue eyes and thinning blond hair, which he combs over a bald spot where his hair 's receded. His voice is a bit loud and harsh. " Valdo shook his head again. " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did n't know what they were getting into. They were anxious to make a killing, and you do n't come to Milton Diesman if you 're too concerned about ethical investing, but they did n't know the details. " I probed and questioned, but Valdo did not remember Glosser. He did n't know whether Diesman or Kohl had brought him in on the deal, and that was all-important. Finally, Valdo said, " Wait a minute. I did n't meet him, but there was a man who was head of a computer firm, or maybe it was electron-ics -- I think it was electronics -- who invested in a number of Diesman 's schemes. That could be your Mr. Glosser. " Several hours at the courthouse confirmed that Anton Glosser had invested in a number of deals where Diesman was the registered agent. I felt fairly sure by now that Glosser was simply greedy rather than predatory. I headed back to the office to see Jesse. He and Peter were waiting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesse was irritated that I had n't told him of my plan, and both he and Peter had a dozen reasons why it was a bad idea. I
