Earlier, at the perimeter. Black cloth hanging from barbed wire. A gook kid. You get us dinky dao? We buy from you? No sweat, GI. You number fucking one, GI. A green patch floats on the South China Sea, but looks white to me until I know it 's green because Mr. Brown says so. Is white a primary color? The absence of color? The whole world gone white. White out. Flashback from Hawaiian acid I took on R and R. Yes, the absence of color. Yes. A sail from a Vietnamese fishing boat. Mr. Brown does n't think so. " It 's a fucking parachute, " Homeboy says. I look at Mr. Brown and Homeboy. Now they are all colors : black silhouettes and elongated shadows streaking across the beach. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings us weed. Mr. Brown says, " Made of silk, ai n't it? " Yes. Silk. Like farting through silk, my father said each payday. " Worth beaucoup dope, " says Homeboy. Beaucoup : much, many. I love them beaucoup. <p> The chute -- a sheet in the wind, the water a clothesline, a bed -- nears the shore, and Homeboy says, " Wade out and get it, Mr. Brown. " Floating. Rolling. Colors in Mr. Brown 's brown eyes in the whites of his eyes say, " You fucking crazy, man. Sharks out there. " Mr. Brown 's brown eyes say sharks out there, man. Now green nylon cords spread like tentacles from a Portuguese man-of-war. Sting the shit out of you. Only cure is piss on the welts. Unraveling, untangling. Mr. Brown 's brown arms pull on the nylon cords. Water laps his legs. " Something inside, " Mr. Brown shouts. A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Words in the surf. The silk unmakes itself into a fighter pilot stuffed into a G-suit. American. Homeboy says, " Jesus Christ. " Rubbery skin. Gray hands. Mr. Brown says : " I need help. " Fat white man. Poor fat dead white man. His head a green helmet -- his eyes covered by a sun visor. Homeboy says we need to turn him loose, drag that white boy up on the beach so his mama can have him back. Dead fighter pilot boy whose mama wants him back. Mr. Brown rolls that dead fighter up on the beach, pulls the silk behind, loosens the cords from his feet. In a few hours military police will remove his helmet, his visor no longer shading his dead eyes, his suit unzipped, his dog tags removed ; one gleams Robert Spendlove when the MP says his name under Vietnam moonlight. Where are Mr. and Mrs. Spendlove tonight? " Holy shit, " Homeboy says. " Did you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and his eyes like shriveled grapes looking at Homeboy. Holy shit. <p> July 21, 1973 Where are we? We 're with these two chicks from the neighborhood. Both good fucks. They 're upstairs in my apartment. Nothing special. Cheap. I rent from Ma. She owns a pool hall downstairs. We 're downstairs in Ma 's Pool Hall. She sells beer and wine, sometimes hard stuff. Ma likes me and Mr. Brown. We 're cool. She says, " Who you got up there? " Ma is closed, blinds drawn, lights out. Her fat hangs over the arms of her chair, droops from her face. Legs too heavy to move. Mr. Brown smiles that big white Mr. Brown smile. " Some girls, " he says. Girls. Yes. " Women, Mr. Brown... women, " says Ma. Dago Girl and Peroxide, Mr. Brown calls them. Peroxide 's big blue Polack eyes, cleavage. Dago Girl 's nipples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls sipping Jim Beam. Two girls waiting for Mr. Brown and me. <p> Ma does n't ask about the war, but she asks about Homeboy. " Prison, " I say. " Jackson for busting up a white man. " Bar fight. A broken white man. Ma only says : " Poor Homeboy. " Her eyes follow Mr. Brown to the back room where she keeps her stash. " where 'd you get that name, Mr. Brown? " says Ma. From Homeboy. Mr. Brown from Detroit town. " My real name 's Toby. Tobias Jones. " Jim Beam and beer in Mr. Brown 's brown hand. Upstairs. Yes. Peroxide says, " Mr. Brown, you one pretty brown man. " A ceiling fan. Detroit heat around a pretty brown man. Dago Girl drops ice into glasses. Mr. Brown pours Jim Beam. Peroxide says, " It feels good, " squeezes Mr. Brown 's thigh. " All of us getting to know each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a red skirt to creamy white panties. Knowing. A hard cock against Peroxide 's leg. Ice clinks in glasses. Dago Girl 's hand inside my shirt. She says, " Come in here. " Now Peroxide and Mr. Brown follow Dago Girl into the bedroom. Zippers. Undressing. A white sheet. A bed for Mr. Brown and me. Dago Girl 's perfumed hair. Mr. Brown 's sweat. White arms and brown legs unweave a tangled sheet. Where are we? The apartment. Yes. A tongue on Dago Girl 's nipple, fingers around Mr. Brown 's cock, a thigh pressed between Peroxide 's legs, Mr. Brown 's brown hand on white ass. Dago Girl says, " Touch all of me. " Breathing. Mr. Brown untwists the sheet from Peroxide 's long legs, pulls her onto the floor, sets her free of the bed. " Oh God, " she says. Laughing. She takes Mr. Brown 's brown hand, leads him to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Water. I 'm so goddamned drunk. Oh God. <p> December 16, 1976 Where does he go? Nowhere. What I know is this : Homeboy is put into a cell across from a man he calls One-Eyed Crane. In his third year at Jackson, Homeboy kills him. Yes. Unknowing. Kills him. <p> What I imagine is this : Crane lying on a bed, staring through the blackness at Homeboy. He sees everything with one blue eye, reads Homeboy 's lips ; he knows when a deal goes down, shivers under his sheet. Excited. Homeboy warns him : " Motherfucker, " he says, " if your eye offends me, I 'll pluck it out. " Crane loves Homeboy 's mouth. Thick lips. Pink inside. He loves to watch it in the dark. Yes. In the night, Homeboy 's lips say, " Look brother, dope for beaucoup green. " A white face, a uniform, a nightstick. " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. No reason. A deal gone wrong. Homeboy finds Crane in a prison laundry room. " Christ, " Crane says, " the nigger 's got me. " A sheet around his head. A cord around his neck. One eye loose from its socket. Crane 's dead -- Homeboy his killer. Jesus. <p> I know it 's close to Christmas because lights strung around a tree look white to me until she says, " I love the colors. They 're beautiful, are n't they? " Her name is Nurse ; the lights in Nurse 's eyes say, " Do you like the ornaments? Can I bring you anything? " Beautiful. Ornaments. Cigarettes. I love this pretty white nurse who brings me cigarettes. Beaucoup cigarettes. Yes. She does n't ask about Homeboy, but shows Mr. Brown where to find me. Veteran 's hospital. Detroit. Mr. Brown works at Ford 's now. He comes to see me, tells me he methodically stacks numbered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stores. He wants to know when I 'll leave the hospital. He has a pretty brown wife, a little brown boy. " Mr. Brown, " I say, " just light this cigarette for me. " <p> <p> By Allen Learst <p>
