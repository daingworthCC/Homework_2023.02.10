1005441 America 's Magic Mountain is a rewriting of Thomas Mann 's famous novel set at a fictional recovery spa called The Elixir located among a range of slag heaps in Central Illinois. The Elixir has " gone autonomous. " Its leader is Mayor Jesse. <p> Dear Dad : There was this guy who owned a Caddy. It was a big green monster of a Caddy and it had once been a real prize of a car( it had in fact been the guy 's pride and joy), but now it was getting old. It leaked oil onto the driveway, and the rings were shot, consequently it used so much oil that he thought he would have to hook up a funnel system through the front seat so that he could empty quarts of 10-30 and STP into the bugger as he drove. Also, the heater leaked onto the carpet and in the cool spring months astonishing mushrooms grew in profusion. The experience of seeing the car go from new and valuable to old and an embarrassment was of course at first a disappointment to the guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those guys who get to see, that the disintegration of the caddy provided an interesting lesson for him about investing self-esteem in objects all of which are not only illusory in and of themselves, but prone to, nay, certain to decay. So he actually kept the beast because it was old and decrepit and because it spoke to him, in an unmistakably clear, green voice, about an important wisdom. And it also would still limp to the grocery store once or twice a week, farting blackly the whole way. But, to get on with this story, one day somebody stole his car right out of his driveway! Seems that the " classics " value of the " 54 Caddy was going through the roof. And even limping as it did and sprouting fungi from its carpet, it was valuable for its near pristine body.( California cars are famously rust free.) When the guy 's neighbor found out what had happened, he ran over( taking, as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, a brand-spanking new Chevy Vega, whose presence suddenly seemed to him much more a matter of speculation than it had before this theft). He said, " I 'm so sorry to hear about your car. I ca n't believe that some young punk "( he was a great one for blaming things on young punks) " has stolen your good ol " Caddy. " The guy looked at his neighbor and said, " You know, I ca n't tell if this is a good thing or a bad. The car was a piece of junk. I did n't dare leave the neighborhood in it. And my homeowner 's policy, for some crazy reason clear only to insurance guys, is going to give me money for it, the kind of money you would expect to get for something that actually ran. I 'm kind of surprised that the thief was able to convince it to fart its way off of the block. On the other hand, I 'll miss the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at him in confounded confusion. " Do n't you fucking get it? Some jackass young punk of a kid stole your automobile right off of your own private property. There are principles involved. " Some weeks later, he got a call from the police saying that they 'd found the Caddy in a nearby used car lot and he could get it back. Also, the owner of the lot wanted to talk to him. So the guy took a bus to the lot and went immediately to his Caddy. He stuck his head inside and smelled the sweet decay, and smiled. Yes, he thought, this is my car. It 's speaking to me. " Born alone, die alone, in between a dream. " That 's my car all right. He was glad. But he had more to be glad about. The owner of the lot felt bad about being taken in by the forged pink slip that the thief had presented him. So he wanted to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a newer car.( Okay, at first he just wanted to offer the guy a " real good deal " on a very new and expensive car, but the guy was no way interested in any factory discounted stock overload sticker rebated special leasing arrangements.) It was a used Plymouth Barracuda, sporty as all get out, still pretty fast, and a real plunge back into memories of the guy 's sportier youth. He thought at first he should n't take it. Another possession to worry about. But these sweet memories and the idea that his neighbor would never shut up if he turned down a free car finally convinced him to go ahead with it. Now the guy 's neighbor was amazed at his good fortune. " I ca n't believe this, " he said, " someone robs you and you not only get the thing you lost back, but you get a new thing worth double or more the thing you supposedly lost! You are such a fucking lucky stiff. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a lesson here himself, if he knew how to recognize it. But all he could recognize was that the guy 's Barracuda made his Chevy Vega( newer though it might be) look lumpish. His Vega had no sporty wire wheels, for example. And the neighbor guy still had two more years of payments to make on his lumpish vehicle.( In truth, he 'd gotten essentially mugged money-wise by his dealer who had nothing more difficult to do to make that sale than wipe the neighbor guy 's drool off his chin. In further truth, with still a year left to pay on it, his Vega would implode after a fan belt broke, the car over-heated, the aluminum block warped, the cylinder walls corrugated, the piston rings wore, and the apocalyptic flatulence of the little Vega made the black farting of the guy 's Caddy look like an azure day.) But the guy himself was strangely uneasy, even worried about his good fortune. He wondered if this flashy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it. He really did n't want to have to worry about scratches and dings and shouting at strangers who parked too close to him. And he sure did n't see the pleasure in spending his weekends out in the driveway with a bucket of soapy water and a can of polish always worried about something. Was it rusty? Was it shiny? Was it shiny enough? Was that a streak on the right rear panel? Strange, I know, but this guy was really different. He thought different thoughts than you and I. He was the kind of guy who understood that each mile that popped up on the odometer was a little death. " I 'll never travel that mile again. This machine is one mile closer to rusting in a junk yard. ") And this was not morbidity talking to him. The guy actually took some sort of weird comfort in these thoughts. He must have been one helluva guy in his previous life. So, anyway, a few weeks later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessed little of the guy 's wisdom-so much for theories that pastlife-wisdom is transferred genetically) took the car out for a spin. An unauthorized spin with the unauthorized ignition key, the unauthorized buddy and the way unauthorized six pack of Olde English 800 malt liquor. He had a license and all but he was really ill-prepared for pushing a speedy roadster fast on country blacktops-like notorious Redwood Road, where high school boys went to diewhich is exactly where he pointed himself and his buddy, as if they had a sort of destiny. Well, inevitably the guy 's son crashed the danged car into a tree. He 'd been swilling some beer and failed to notice a curve( " there were a lot of curves, " he complained, " and I only missed one ") and went into a big old cedar( second growth, but fifty-year-old second growth and more than big enough to shiver this kid 's timber). Happily, it was a sort of glancing blow that more diverted than crushed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although both had numerous broken bones and cuts to their faces which flowed freely and terrified mothers for one hundred miles in every direction. The neighbor, who was by this time starting to wear a path in the lawn with his frequent need to console/congratulate, came over to tell the guy how sorry he was.( Although, you know how these things go in the human brain, he was n't entirely sorry to see how smashed up the guy 's Barracuda was.) But the guy said, " I do n't know how to feel about it. My son is going to be okay. The car is trashed, and I ca n't repair it because I did n't have collision coverage on it, but I 'm sort of glad that I do n't have to worry any more about how it will affect my life. Plus, if I leave it crippled in the driveway for the next few years it will serve as a constant reminder to my son. He needed the opportunity to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news. " The neighbor retreated, muttering, back across the lawn to his own home, walking by his own frighteningly shiny Vega.( He actually, for the first time, looked at it with some suspicion.) Two years later, when the guy 's son was draft age, he received a letter from the draft board telling him that it was time to serve his country. In Viet Nam. So the poor dumb kid went down with hundreds of other poor dumb kids. But the guy 's poor dumb kid failed the physical because his knees had some resemblance to knees but also to mashed potatoes, all thanks to one Barracuda and one cypress tree. Again, the guy had to look at the situation and say, " If my son had n't driven the Barracuda into a tree, he would be on his way now to Viet Nam. Instead, he can go to college. If he can get into one with a 1.95 GPA. This is a great thing. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws of irony were set to spinning. The boy went to college where he met hippies and draft card burners and went to concerts at the Fillmore West and took a few consciousness-expanding drugs which, given the constricted consciousness he took them with, could n't help but do just that-expand his brain. So he came home with this new, expanded brain and lectured his father on imperialism and the military industrial complex and the CIA and the hypocrisy of the guy 's generation and on and fucking on. So, once again, the guy was totally unsure about the good/badness of what had happened. He even wondered if he would n't rather have had his son shipped off to the Nam. Or killed by the cedar. Or never born! But the guy was really getting quite wise about this **30;135;TOOLONG stuff. So rather than taking his son by his ponytail and smashing the hell out of him, he decided to build a sunroom on the back of his home. Lovely California sunlight streamed into that room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunlight. He filled it with house plants( among them, a very swart bonsai cedar!) and one squat chair. The chair was pointed at a little shrine into which he had built the severed front end of the old Caddy. And whenever he 'd think that something good or bad had happened to him, he 'd go into his sun room and sit and look at the grill of the Caddy. Sometimes the grill would look like it was the angry growling mouth of some predatory animal. At other times it looked like a very toothy and vaudevillian grin. Sometimes it was both at the same time. Because of this, the guy frequently found himself laughing. Which was fine and hurt no one except that the guy 's neighbor could hear him laughing and see him sitting in his weird little sunroom laughing, and he did n't know what it was about, but he wondered if the guy might be laughing about him. And it started to drive him crazy. He fantasized about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window of his freaky room( which would have been the ultimate test for the guy 's philosophy). And he damned near did. He was getting that bugged about it. But he did n't. Instead, he packed up his shiny Vega in which slept a smoggy future, sold his house and bought a nice not-yet-dented vinyl place out in the new subdivisions in Walnut Creek there to reside with thousands of others who, when their Chevy Vegas selfdestructed and farted blackly, would curse the car, its maker and their personal fates as very bad things indeed. When the guy heard his neighbor was moving, he did n't know if it was a good or bad thing. After all.... Interview with Mayor Jesse about Life at The Elixir Q-Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor, for agreeing to answer a few... Mayor Jesse-Pesky questions!? Just a second, son. Hey, Hal, whattaya... Ha ha! Hal you fuck head! Just put it where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right, fuck head is what I said, fuck head is what I meant. Whattaya mean what 's it mean? You never heard that expression before? It means you got fuck in your head.... You do n't know what fuck is? Well, if that do n't beat.... Never even seen pictures, Hal? Get out of town! I 'll explain it to you later. I 'm busy now. Go ahead, son. Q-Well, as I was.. MJ-Whoa! I do n't believe that! I do n't believe what I just saw, what I believe that fuck head is up to back there. I 'm real sorry about this, son. Just one more moment and you 've got my undivided attention. Hey! Hal! Ha ha! Jeez. Are you a pervert or what, Hal? Well that 's some of the same kind of shit we might expect from a pervert. Unbelievable. No, do n't show me again, I saw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of nonsense you 're up to. It 's nonsense. And now the whole town knows. Good God, son, can you believe he 's a growed man? Q-He 's very spirited and unpredictable. MJ-Unpre-! Oh you do n't know the half of it. He 's one spirited fuck head, he is. You do n't see fuck heads that pure much anymore. He 's no garden variety. Or if he is, he 's like a brussels sprout fuck head with all those little fucked up type brussel heads or whatcha call " em growing up and down his neck. Q-Yes. I take your meaning. But what I 'd like... MJ-Now wait a minute. What do you mean, " I take your meaning "? What 's something like that mean? Is that some kind of special interview type talk? I said I 'd talk with you, but you did n't say nothin " about talking like some damned computer. You 're not one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take your meaning. " Where you gon na take it? I 'll let it pass, but it 's fortunate for you that I 'm an understandin " fella. Cuz if it were my man Hal there, why, he 's just the sort of fuck head make a boy like you sorry. Q-I am sorry... MJ-Oh hell I do n't wan na hear about how sorry you are. Forget it. Here, you want some of this before we get started? Q-No thanks. I do n't drink coffee after a certain hour. MJ-Coffee! Hell, son, this ai n't coffee. Everything what 's in a thermos ai n't coffee. Hell no. This is Kankakee Rye Whiskey, man. Best sippin " whiskey or gulpin " whiskey or just plain drainkin " whiskey here in Central Illinois. Q-No thanks. I 've got my own little flask now. MJ-Well good for you! I 'm glad to hear it. But after awhile those little flasks just do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Try puttin " two or three of those in a coat pocket. Not just that they do n't hold enough, cuz there 's always more at the Fountains, but they just do n't pour fast enough. A man gets frustrated. I mean I got brussels sprout type fuck heads like Hal here around me all day, so when I need to take a belt I need to take a belt. This whatchacall interview will go a whole lot better if I keep my motor runnin '. That way, you get the " amplified affect " as opposed to the " sober interactional state " like the Professor says. Q-Okay, can I ask my first question. MJ-Sure, son. Go ahead. Shoot. Q-Well, I guess I 'd like to know what you think about the controversies, both recent and remote, over the therapeutic function of The Elixir and its role in state health care. MJ-That 's some question, son. Where 'd you learn to ask a question like that? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it. That must be one of those clever tricks you learned at Downstate. But I think I know what you 're gettin " at. You want to know how we maintain our reputation as Central Illinois " best state supported rehab/ detox facility? That 's what the rest of them pussies from the newspapers want to know too. Well, I 'll tell you. I never told no one else before, but I 'll tell you. I do n't want no one else to hear, so bend on over this way a little... IT 'S BECAUSE THOSE STATE SOCIAL SERVICE GIRLS ARE A BUNCH OF WEAK SISTER BRUSSELS SPROUT NECK FUCK HEAD PUSSIES.... And that 's the reason why. Q-I see. MJ-Sure! It 's because the State of Illinois is afraid of us is what it is. Sure, they got questions about our methods. Everyone does. We 're famous! But they know that if they pulled their funding, which I have more than politely asked them to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could n't touch us. We have no shortage of our own resources, man. " Funding " us gives them a little bit of contact with us, if not influence. Sure as hell ai n't control. So now what we do, they give us money and we take the check up to Chicago and buy something big, an abandoned building or something that size, take it out to the field by the train depot and torch it. Some anthropo, anthropo-somethin " guy said this big fire made out of a gift had primitive resonance. Coffee clutch or,... Hal? what that brussels sprout neck anthropo-somethin " guy call our big fires? You do n't recall? Was n't coffee clutch, was it? Yeah, it was? What I thought. But shit that do n't make no sense. Why 'd a guy call a big ass fire a coffee clutch beats the hell out of me. Anyway, that 's what we do with the State 's pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got 8,520 some residents out here, all of " em good white people with money in their savings accounts and willing to spend it for the privilege of a prolonged stay here, and we got six buildings and underground facilities. We pay zero taxes, have zero unemployment, zero employment and no crime. We have annexed communities around us and attract more industry and satellite corporate endeavors than all but the top ten states in the union. Our bond ratings are AAA+. Moody accountants pule at my damn boots. You know that Mitsubishi wood chip factory over Coal City way? That 's our tax base, and boy do they pay it. Seems no one else wanted the publicity. But shit, they were gon na grind up all those Amazon logs somewhere. Right? We got every high-tech piece of bric-a-brac you can stack. Con Ed runs a nuclear reactor just for us. We even have a fuckin " radar if you can believe that. Not even I know what the hell it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spinnin " round top one of the slag heaps. Recovery is like a natural resource for us. We own, I mean own, half the state legislature, and they are not cheap. We have a long ass waiting list to get in here. I have personally refused former United States presidents simply because I did n't think they 'd fit in and, to be quite frank with you, I do n't like their type. But the bottom line is, our clinicians have nailed their pansy asses to the hardwood on this one. We have showed in studies what the Laboratory of Alcohol Research boys in Tuscola are still peein " their pants about : alcohol do n't hurt nothin '! It helps families, man. It is part of the Ritual of Family Life and has been for some time. Without alcohol, I do n't expect you could even recognize an American family. It is now a hallowed tradition. It helps grease decision making. Danged if it do n't. It provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no one says it " cept a few brave souls like the Reverend Boyle. Ask him, he 'll tell you the truth. He knows all the facts. Hal, run get some of the Reverend 's facts for the boy. Facts aside, I can quote you chapter and verse. Take the case of Joe and Sally. Sally was a computer analyst, and Joe he just drank a whole lot. Now they had a very stable marital relationship for over fifteen years until someone made the mistake of suggesting that Joe 's drinking was some kind of problem. I do n't remember just how they put it. So Joe cleaned up and he and Sally went into therapy. Fuckin " disaster! Joe was depressed all the time now. He 'd look at ol " Sally sittin " opposite him and say, " Man alive, she 's fat as sin. I am married to a fat woman. She is no foolin " a real haystack. " Which I think even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned good. Then, of course, she 'd go into the old " tearful affect. " Man, a fat woman, with them big red cheeks like someone rubbed them with sandpaper, who does the old " tearful affect " is way worse than ugly. That 's the sort of thing that can put you off your feed. She gives ugly a bad name. Anyway, so Joe he 's sittin " there sayin " nuthin " to nobody for weeks on end thinkin " with way more clarity than he likes, " So this is my life. Nothin " pretty about this, " and old Sally just sits there like this blubber-monster of boo-hoo. I ask you, where is this cure at? You call this " better " than something else? Anyhow, we finally got old Joe and Sally up here at The Elixir and first thing we do, we put " em in group. And I mean this group was the group to beat all groups. We musta had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with active substance problems in one big room. When that happens we call it Wormstock. One big nation under the Worm. And nearly as peaceful. Could n't have been more than two or three fist fights on the periphery. Everybody 'd heard about this big fat composition of a computer woman who goes boo-hoo and her skinny " salesman " drunk of a husband. Just the thought was pornographic. So you know we sit " em down, get three or four folding chairs propped around old Sally and first thing I say is, " Joe, you know, why do n't you have a little taste before we get started? " And he looks at me wide-eyed, as if I were trying to trick him. So I say, " Joe, lookit, we 're gon na get you where you wan na go. But we got irregular means. We 're not like all the rest. We 're what they call unusual. " And so he says, " Well, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say, " We got Kankakee Rye is what we got. " So I hand him this very thermos right here and he pours himself a nice transfusion. Well, was n't long before old Joe jumps up out of his so-called depression. A mean deprivation of basic human rights is more like what it was. A man has got to be allowed the requisite tools to face the damned day. Now he 's assertive, angry and demanding and now he wants to know why it is that old Sally never wants to have sex with him. Well now, do n't you see?, we 've got these difficulties in the open. Joe 's got more stuff to get in the open. He 's got baggage. He 's got issues like everybody else. Because of old Sally, he 's sure got the " when women get old they get ugly " issue or a very chubby version thereof. Some people do n't like that issue and do n't think of it so much as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, open your damned eyes! And Joe 's goin " on about how fat his little buttery squab of a wife has become and why the heck do n't she get a Nordic track or something to take the edge off this meat mountain. Sally, she says that she has a complaint, too. She says unless old Joe 's drunk he has no sexual interests at all and in fact drunk or sober has had no nodding acquaintance with an erection in, lo, these last seven or eight years. Then comes the old tearful affect again. Oh boy! Group is dyin " out there. They 're breakin " up. Fallin " out. Makin " like a bunch of whoopin " cranes on a funny drug. So this is the famous butterball of boo-hoo. But then, old Joe 's little sneaky fingers are stroking the inside of her dimpled thigh. And he do n't seem to know where to stop. We lost sight of his hand. But she do n't seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my opinion, her leg o " lamb was just too damned thick for nerve endings. I mean, you get this fat just goin " on and on, deep like some peat bog, and the nerve endings I believe get lost and confused. So while she 's goin " boo-hoo, he 's just gropin " away, heedless. Meanwhile, group is lovin " this stuff. Wormstock. Fat women having sex, drunks with nothin " hard about " em, and everything bathed in boo-hoo. I 'll tell it like it is : while Joe and Sally were residents here, this place was alive. Nothin " that interesting come this way again till a certain college boy from Downstate who shall go nameless. But my point is, do n't you see, that Joe and Sally were better able to demonstrate a wide range of behaviors, more capable and comfortable engaging each other, more attentive to each other 's feelings when we added a little Kankakee Rye to the equation. With alcohol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And Sally, feeling disgusted and degraded by his dirty drunken pawing, was able to deflect her guilt at being the portly cause of her husband 's impotence. What Sally and Joe achieved with our assistance was a clearer understanding of the emotional economy central to their relationship. Sobriety! Do n't make me laugh! It 's just not good for everyone. You got to learn to work alcohol. It 'll work if you let it. Hunnert percent promise. Last I heard, Sally was still being mistaken for landscaping and Joe was still catching furniture on fire in his zealous housekeeping, and they are still married. Some people like to talk about " let 's get real. " Okay, let 's get real. Nobody 's gon na strap Sally to a machine and jiggle off three hundred pounds. And no one 's gon na get Joe 's dingle to do more than flap in the wind. The Worm has its own path. It 's a shiny one. Let the Worm find @ @ @ @ @ @ @
