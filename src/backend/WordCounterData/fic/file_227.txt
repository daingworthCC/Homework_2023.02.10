4162641 knew all about this kid before I even heard of her. You know what I mean. I had n't actually encountered this one particular sixteen-yearold, but I am more than familiar with the accounts of girls just like her from teachers and counselors. You stay in the business long enough you may not see everything, but you certainly get to know these certain types, as much as one deplores even using that phrase : " a certain type. " They 're good looking, these kids, and seductive and edgy, and cagey. And tough. And they work hard managing this impression they give off, to borrow a term from Erving Goffman. You can see how some of the kids they go to school with would be attracted to them so strongly they can barely stop thinking about them, while other kids ca n't stand them, especially other girls ; girls in middle and high school can be downright catty with one another. You 'll even see gang boys shaking their heads in disbelief of how these girls mouth off to one another. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most aggressive thoughts rise up in them merely at the mention of the names of these girls of a certain type. I meet these girls and think, oh, man, do they make liking them difficult. They 're the type, that word again, that convinces me there 's a population of parents who with very little prodding will readily admit they do n't love all their children equally. In fact, they do n't love some of their children at all! Research suggests that the families of bullies are often troubled. Generally, bullies ' parents are hostile, rejecting, or just plain indifferent to their children. The father in these homes, if he is even present, is often weak, and the mother tends to be isolated. And bullies are sometimes thought to be cool. This girl coming to see me is very possibly one of the unlovable or even unloved ones. Then, as I mull over these thoughts of which I am not all that proud but which help me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my own life that I hope will aid me in understanding her, attaching to her, and bearing witness to her, I start peeling away in my mind her first skin, that outer skin she works so hard to maintain. Oh sure, she uses every brand of makeup concoction known to womankind, but I think we all know the sorts of things she 's trying so diligently to cover up ; I bet her parents wish she would work as hard on her studies as she does on her face. It 's not the blemishes or the barest remnants of adolescent acne she wishes to conceal ; it 's hurt. It 's hurt that all the anger and toughness is meant to conceal. " Anger is pain remembered, " someone remarked once. That line has stayed with me for years. It makes sense : If you 're angry all the time it means you feel pain all the time : this child surely does. I just have the feeling that she does. A poet spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, too. They 're pilgrims, these people ; that 's exactly what they are, whether or not they even know " Come, all ye you wandering mourning Christian, pilgrims dear " from the Pilgrim 's Songster. She 's a pilgrim, all right. Peel away the second skin and you 'll find the grief and abject desperation only the most isolated and rejected people experience. Want to know why she pushes people around, makes outrageous demands on them, or threatens if not outright coerces them? It 's simple : she feels not the slightest capacity to control the world that veritably explodes within her skull. The kid 's no psychopath ; she 's on fire. They can tell me all they want about how cool she looks, how cool she talks, how cool she appears. Let me tell you something : when speaking with her you might want to know where they house the closest fire extinguisher. You do n't have to fear for your life, but you do have to fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand conversations during which you spend exactly eleven million dollars on food for her, she 's going to reveal her need for you, her appreciation of you, or her trust in you, then you may want to consider a whole other profession. I 'm telling you, she 's going to take the themes of independence, mistrust, the glory of separation from everyone who has ever lived or ever will live, and the everlasting beauty of living life on your own, and jam them down your throat every chance she gets. She 's the embodiment of number one, numero uno, which makes you number twenty-three trillion. In her mind, this kid over here sucks, and that kid over there sucks, and the teachers suck, especially Mrs. Gray and Mr. J., and the counselors suck, and her parents suck, her mother by far more than her father. When you 've been hurt, the world appears full of awfulness. Wait long enough and you 'll hear how while she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should love it, she hates every other animal in the world and all the flora as well, short of the family Christmas tree, which, of course, her mother has to " completely ruin by decorating it with so much crap you could n't even tell what color the tree was. " And her mother loves gardening, " which makes her even more of a fraud because if you really loved nature you would n't go screw it up when you yourself put some of it in your own living room. " Then again, it would be pretty easy to deduce that no matter what she tells you, her mother " loves that stupid plant outside the kitchen window more than she ever loved anyone. " Be alert here : These are not the clues directing you to ask questions like " What is going through your mind? " or " So how do you feel about all of this? " or " Deep down, is n't it true you really do love your mother and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not wise choices. Better to sit quietly, nod if you have to, you can always evince that knowing counselor 's nod, and pray that something might occur, or just as significantly, not occur, that will keep this child from running off leaving you sitting all alone in your office mumbling something about feeding pearls to swine. And why might she do this? Well, she may very well be getting the feeling that speaking with you might rank as one of the dumbest and least productive ways she could spend an hour of her precious time, and time management, after all, is tremendously important in the life of a multi-tasker like this. Or perhaps she defines a counselor as someone supervising kids in a cabin located at a New Hampshire summer camp. Waste not, want not. Waste everything, want everything. Or perhaps she 's afraid of what you might touch in her, or touch off, which is sort of a hopeful conjecture. Or, she might actually imagine that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she does. Lots of kids, after all, are never satisfied with your merely knowing what they think and feel ; they insist that you think and feel exactly what they think and feel. And if you ca n't, you 're toast! So just maybe this kid who, like I say, I have met on a hundred occasions, some of them in this very same office, might bolt and cause me to feel for a minute precisely what she feels all the time. You want someone faithful, someone who offers you an alle-giance, someone with whom you can negotiate some important human business about, I do n't know, anything? If that 's the case, she 's not who you want. If, on the other hand, you 're attracted to distrust, enjoying people 's failures, living the isolated life, and craving practically everything while spewing words about needing nothing, then she 's your girl! If agitation, impatience, petulance, along with generous helpings of disdain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other words starting with the letter d, then she is most definitely the one for you. So fight her back, meet fire with fire. Tell her if you think she distrusts you and disapproves of you, well, right back at you, honey! You do n't think I 'm a winner? Good enough. I 'll see your bet and raise you. Fact is, I 'll go all in, which I bet not a lot of folks do with you. Am I right? Tell you what : I 'll take what I see as your terror and give you what you see as my torpor. Deal? You know what you are, what 's that television show, THE BIGGEST LOSER! There, that 's exactly what I want to say. There is n't anybody who would tolerate your acerbic, negative, and histrionic moods and I do n't even care that you do n't know the meaning of the word histrionic. No, I will not give you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oops, sorry. My bad. Go on your smart phone and Google the word and smirk that smirk of yours that screams how pathetic you think I am, and so old I actually still practice the dictionary habit. So why do n't you and I speak a little about that way you talk and dress and act. How 's that sound? Pretty good. No? So what do you think you might like to speak with me about? That last option, actually, proved not to be all that bad. Here was her hardly surprising reply. " Look Dr. whatever your last name is because I heard my father call you one thing and my mother another thing. I do n't mean they called you bad names.... " She was actually smiling at this point, and for the slightest instant I saw the face of a child, and an awfully pretty face it was. " I just think neither one of them knows your real name. " All of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it? No I did n't say that ; I thought it, though. " I 'm only here because the school made me come. " " And why is that? " " Beats the shit out of me. You 'll have to ask them. " " Who should I call? " " How would I know ; I just obey the laws. " Ai n't what I heard, kiddo. I heard you 've been selling and using drugs. Like Adderall. " Tell me this. Your parents report that they are concerned that you 've been using drugs. Anything about this true? " " They told you that? " " They did, yes. " " Then they 're fucking liars! " " Did they make this up? " " I do n't know what the fuck they do. And I could care less. " Clever retort. Original, too ; I 'll have to use it sometime. " So I do n't have to worry about you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " again that little hint of a smile, " I really do n't care what you worry about, what you think, what you believe. Your life is of absolutely no interest to me and I seriously doubt that my life is of much interest to you. So you 're going to have to think about how we 're going to spend -- is it an entire hour we have to be here? -- if you ca n't talk to me about using drugs. Or what do you all call it, substance abuse. " With that she looks down at the baby-blue phone resting on her lap and I can see how she is practically praying that she has received a text requiring immediate action. Yes, mercifully, there is one there and she reads it and starts thumbing letters on a tiny key board faster than my poor brain can read large print. I glance over from my chair as if it were even possible to read what she might be composing. Good gracious, she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state demanding that she report at once her findings from her recent top-secret mission to Libya, Mali, and the Sudan. I sure hope that she 'll have enough bars to send that message cleanly from my office where cell phone transmission is frequently compromised. I mean, how can the State Department carry on without her response! Sitting in a doctors office. What a waste. Real turkey. Very old. Not good at what he does. Wants to talk drugs. Got any? Are we meeting tonight? What should I wear? J. " Do I have to stay here the whole hour? " You think I care. I get paid no matter what you do. If this is a waste for you, what do you think it is for me? You know there are a whole lot of folks who would n't mind being in that chair working on things that torment them, or perhaps just looking for a little guidance on some insignificant problem they 're experiencing, like their child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly like you to. " " Why, so you can get paid? " " No, not for the pay. " " Bullshit! If you do n't get paid, you 're not going to sit there and talk to me. Not for five minutes. This is only about money. " " You think that? " " I know that. So do n't go there with the charity rap. Every kid I know says the same thing about shrinks. It 's a total waste! " No, it 's you, Missy, that 's the total waste. Who the hell gives you the right to walk in here, sit in that chair with your skirt hiked up like that, and say anything you want to whomever you want whenever you want. You think you 're the only one around here hurting? This is the way you survive? And this is what you have to pull off every day? Jesus, you must be absolutely exhausted from this performance, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe is a gigantic charade, not all that well done, truthfully. Take a break. Chill. That 's one of your words, is n't it? If I 'm your enemy you must have some really splendid friends! I know you 're not about to take down the walls that separate us or drain the moat, but for God 's sake cut back the hedges, will ya, so I can at least see what you look like. " I 'll make you a deal. " " I do n't make deals. " Probably a smart idea, not that I believe you for a minute. Fact is, I think you make deals every day of your life, many of them with people who benefit a whole lot more from the deal than you ever will. And let me assure you, if you do ever manage to pull your life together, you 're going to take inventory of all these deals and see what you 've lost, and I assure you if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to death then. You stay alive, I assure you I am not going to be the last counselor you 'll ever meet. " Let me start again. Let me ask some questions. If you like ' em, you answer. If you do n't like ' em you remain silent. " " I 'll remain silent. How much time we have left? " " We have some time. Or better yet, why do n't you tell me a story. " " You want to hear a story? " " Yes. I would. " " You do n't think that 's pretty weird, doctor? " " Tell you what. New deal. I 'll start the story, then you pick it up when I stop, and when you stop, I pick it up and we go back and forth like that. " " Okay, but can I ask one question? " Like this was going to go easily. What are you going to ask because while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of the history of America 's geopolitical relationship with Libya and Mali is embarrassingly scant. " Go ahead. " " Is this your idea of counseling, or do other people do it this way too? " " I do n't know what others do, but I suspect that they... " What do you want from me? A sociological analysis of the various forms counseling can take and then some systematic, quantitative report on the efficacy of this form compared with the efficacy of that form? Make it hard on yourself, Sister, but stop hocking me. Let me tell you what even the Buddha says, and God knows he 's big on serenity and tranquility : It ai n't going to be easy, this life-living business. Karma, Dharma, it 's fraught with struggle. So if anyone promised you the easy life they lied. You got that? They lied! Although I really wish I knew who did make it is so hard for you because the pain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. It is no surprise that I should mark this line in Teju Cole 's novel Open City : " I learned the art of listening from him, and the ability to trace out a story from what was omitted. " I was tracing. " Once upon a time. " My Lord, she was starting the story. " No, that 's all. Your turn. " Well, I did get four words out of her. " Once upon a time there was a little girl who wanted everyone in the world to believe she was safe and beautiful and happy. Well, that might have been the way she felt when she was very young. But when she got older she did n't feel as happy, or as pretty, or as confident. In fact, at times she felt sad and began to doubt that life was going to work out all that well for her. She never stopped thinking she was smart, but being smart just was n't enough. So one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do I feel sad? And her mother looked at her and said... " Her turn. " Well, my daughter, " and these were her words almost exactly, " I think your question means that it is finally time for me to tell you a secret I have always known I would someday have to reveal to you. Are you ready to hear it? And the little girl said yes. Well, said the mother, after your brother and sister were born I told your father we should stop having children. And your father said that is ridiculous. We love children and should have more. But I said no ; we 're finished! I do n't care what you want ; I do n't want any more. And then you came along and we had to have you. You were an accident. We did n't need another child. Your turn. " "... Especially not another girl. One is enough. Because I knew you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon she was really looking at me. It was as though I was about to reveal an important truth. " You see, my daughter, some people want to love but they have difficulty showing it. They want to get close to people but something holds them back. They hunger for affection but they either run away from it or act it out by advertising their sexuality. But mother, the little girl said, you do love me, do n't you? And the mother looked at her daughter and said... " She resumed without missing a beat. " And the mother looked at her daughter and said... " and she could n't go on. I waited for her but she could n't speak. Predictably, she looked down at her phone. Her fingers twitched, but she did n't pick it up. Then she began looking around the room and I thought, she 's forming a mental picture of this place ; she is never coming back. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her, but I have lost it ; I have lost her. It 's just like the comic says, I hate when this happens ; I hate when I do this. " Throw the bum out, " my father used to say. " He 's breaking my heart. " She did it, too. I tried to not let it happen but she did it. I put up every front I know, every piece of disdain for kids and especially those of that certain type. You think she has walls and moats and hedges? She should only inspect my castle. Is it because I lived so many years with the feeling that no one knew what I struggled with, what caused me to feel so unhappy that I now dread that I can not reach into a child and assure her I know exactly what she is thinking and feeling. And okay, I 'll go all in : I will feel what she 's feeling if that 's what she needs. No one did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these kids. I just can not endure those feelings of utter aloneness again. I swear I am not using her to work out my problems. I am using my problems, my history, my story merely to connect with her. At least I think this is the case. Cole 's words again : "... in the subway, standing close to strangers, jostling them and being jostled by them for space and breathing room, all of us reenacting unacknowledged traumas, the solitude intensified. " Do I dare continue the story? " You want me to go on with the story? " She was sobbing, and staring down at the Kleenex box but her hands never left her lap. Mascara fell down her cheeks to her chin. Then, without the slightest bit of self-consciousness she looked up at me and I speak the truth when I say she went minutes without blinking. It was as if she needed to tell me how badly she was hurting and that, but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this pain to me. This was my one chance. " And the mother looked at the daughter and said... You know what, kiddo, I 'm stuck, too. I think I want out of the story. " " Because you do n't believe me, do you? " " I believe you believe your mother does n't love you. " " Damn you! For one minute I had you out of that shrink space of yours. Speak real to me. Speak like a real person. " I actually liked that term, " shrink space. " My life trajectory seems to have taken place in a shrink space. First they sent me to shrinks, now people are sending their kids to me ; I have n't progressed all that far. " I do n't know what your mother feels. " I stopped her from interrupting. " I am certain you believe she did n't want you and I would never have wanted to hear the words she said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child I treated during my training in a prominent Boston Hospital told me they were unwanted. The biggest word in their vocabularies was accident. I sat across from them in a small bright office while a social worker visited with their mothers in an adjoining office ; that 's the way it worked in those days. The social workers conversed with the women who told the children with whom I was trying so hard to connect that they were unwanted accidents. Somebody tell me : what kind of progress can an inexperienced therapist be expected to make? You might say the odds are sort of stacked against us, and the children. Where do you even start, confronted with this? " C'm on, your mom was only kidding. Everyone says that but no one really means it. " Those words were n't about to cut it. The fact is, people say these exact words to their children and the children never forget them. Some of the parents change their feelings when they see how well their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their original pronouncement : " I never wanted you! " The reports by children brought to the hospital for who remembers now what problems or symptoms caused me to experience a fatigue so unbearable I labored to stay awake during those sessions. Actually, I do recall one of the symptoms of those children decades ago : sadness. I saw in their faces the saddest sadness ; the only retreat from it was sleep. We did n't know that much about attention deficit disorder in those days, though we did recognize children having difficulty concentrating. Ironically, the more counselors learn about ADD the more some of them believe it may be anxiety and depression they are observing, both of which encumber concentration. In point of fact, there are several varieties of anxiety, but the one that seems to hurt children the most is separation anxiety ; the power of connection is palpable. So is the power of disconnection. And what sort of self-worth can children be expected to maintain feeling they are connected to no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these children are n't really distracted ; perhaps they 're merely reflecting on their aloneness, anxiety, depression, and sadness. Research shows that when parents appear to know what they 're doing, their children tend to turn out all right. It seems almost too simple, but correct. Other research suggests that heightened anxiety causes children to imagine their actions must be perfect. This kid across from me does not confirm the finding. She 's going out of her way to be the wholly imperfect child she imagines her mother imagined she would turn out to be. Or so I imagine. " The story ends with the shrink, in his shrink space of course, telling the girl that she is pretty all right and that she 's going to be okay. He is pretty sure of that. " Her turn. " And the girl looks at the shrink and says, it sounds good, but there is no way in the world that you could know that. " My turn. " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel it. And he can root for her. " Her turn. " And the girl says he 's going to root for the girl who feels she has no roots. " My turn. " And if the shrink says that 's pretty profound but perhaps the girl can find a new way to plant herself in the earth, the girl would say... " " The girl would say you are so full of shit it 's almost entertaining. " " So, come back and if nothing else we can continue with the entertainment? " " I know what you think, Dr. God, I still do n't know your name. You 're worried, are n't you, that I 'm going to kill myself? Admit it. That 's what you 're thinking. " " I do admit it, " I reply. " So why do you care? You do n't even know me. " " I know you somewhat. And I know me lots. So the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel we both would have failed ; we both ought to have done better. For you. " Her hesitation told me she was working on what might just be the perfect response. Every act needs a closing. The comic needs the best line of the night, the singer the song that brings the audience to its feet. I 'm doing it again ; I 'm protecting myself. If this kid kills herself I swear to God I 'll kill her! " Do me a favor. " I feel as if I am practically begging her. " Why? " " So I can feel that I have n't completely failed here. " " Maybe you need the shrink. " " Maybe so. Do the favor. " " What is it? " " Make me a promise that... " She was way ahead of me. " That if I ever feel the urge to commit suicide I will call you no matter what time of day or night. Right? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'll think about it. " And with that she rose, looked quickly around the office, the mental picture apparently now fixed in her brain, and strode out. Calls over the following days to her and her parents failed to result in another appointment. For all I knew she would never learn my name. And then, a little more than two years later, a call, one-thirty in the morning. From her. She was struggling with an urge. I could hear that she was high on something and still she had called. I wondered if she still owned the baby-blue phone. " I kept my promise. I think you better come. " Driving to the address she had given me, I remembered a story told to me by a colleague who had moved to a rural area adjacent to the college at which he had taken a position. Soon after purchasing a restored farmhouse, his daughter was visited, in her bedroom, by of all things a baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom window almost every night and let the little girl pet him? The visitations went on for months until one night the raccoon left and never returned. My friend 's daughter was heartbroken even though her parents had warned her of the inevitable final separation. Then one night, about two years later, the girl was awakened by a scuffling sound outside her window. The raccoon had returned but it was obvious he was ill. The family took him to the local veterinarian and allowed the raccoon to recover in the child 's bedroom. He appeared to grow stronger by the day until one night he sat on the windowsill making it evident that he was intent on leaving her once again. And this time it was forever. I, too, would have one evening with her that involved her being hospitalized, and a few visits over the following weeks, and then she, too, was gone. Over time, however, I made inquiries about her and I was right, she ended up fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @.
