1010441 Sally Cat frowned her deepest frown at her kittens. They had lost their mittens again. " I think I left mine on a park bench when I was running up and down the paths, " said Jennifer Kitten. " I think I lost mine when I was playing baseball with the guys, " said Jason Kitten. " And mine disappeared when I was climbing trees, " explained Rosie Kitten. " You must think that I have nothing to do but knit mittens for you, " Sally Cat said as she swished her thick tail from side to side. " Now all of you go out and look for your mittens, and do not come back without them! " <p> Jennifer, Jason, and Rosie hung their heads and trooped out of the house. They knew they had been careless, and they hoped they could find their mittens. Sally Cat went out to the front gate to let the cool air calm her temper. She dearly loved her kittens, but she was tired of always knitting mittens. Tillie Cat came down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. She stopped and asked, " How are you today, Sally? " " I am upset, " replied Sally. " I have to buy more wool for my kittens " mittens. " " Have they lost another set of mittens? " asked Tillie. <p> " Yes, they have, " said Sally. " They are out looking for them now. " She looked at Roger and Michelle, who were sitting at Tillie 's feet. " Do your kittens lose their mittens? " she asked. " Not at all, " Tillie said proudly. " They never lose their mittens. See-they are wearing them now. " " I wonder why your kittens are so good, " pondered Sally. " Roger never loses his mittens when he is playing baseball? " " I do not play baseball, " said Roger. " I get too tired. I would rather watch TV. " " And Michelle? She never loses her mittens when she is running races in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sally. " I do not run races. I hate exercise. " Sally looked at Tillie 's two sluggish kittens. Then she thought of her own active youngsters, always ready for a romp. Would she rather have her healthy kittens who always lost their mittens, or these poor, tired, heavy-eyed kits? Sally smiled. <p> Just then, Jennifer, Jason, and Rosie came running up to the gate. They lowered their heads when they saw their mother. " Not one of us could find a single mitten, " said Jennifer. " We are very sorry, Mother. " " Well, we must be running along, " Tillie said. She was afraid that if her kittens stayed to play with Sally 's, they might lose their mittens, too. " Come kittens, " she said. When Tillie and her family had gone, Sally looked at her children. She found Jason hanging from a branch above her head. Jennifer was racing around the rosebushes, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to laugh. She could see why mittens would not stay on them. But kittens were supposed to wear mittens. So she said, " Children, I am going to buy a present for each of you. " Jennifer, Jason, and Rosie scrambled over to her and cried, " Oh, what are you going to buy for us, Mother? " " I am going to buy knitting needles for you, " said Sally. " Then you can lose all the mittens you want, because I am going to teach you to knit your own! "
