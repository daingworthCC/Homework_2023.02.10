1009541 The second thing Riley wanted for his fortieth birthday was a gun. Just a simple hunting rifle, not the sort of thing that would scare a grown man, and though Samantha did n't like guns, was n't a fan of weapons of any kind, she was a pushover, Riley thought, and she loved him besides, so he had the feeling she 'd come around. <p> And there she was on his big day, having festooned the kitchen with ribbons and balloons and little-boy mobiles, and even the gun itself looked as if it were intended for a little boy, wrapped in bright red paper with toy soldiers on it and a navy blue ribbon tied in the middle of the thing. <p> Riley would have had Samantha believe he knew something about guns, but Samantha was n't buying it. Samantha did n't buy much about him if you asked Riley. Riley had gone hunting once with his father when he was a boy, had shot some quail and geese and even a deer, which with the help of his father he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother to make venison. Riley had told this story to Samantha several times, and each time he told it she gave him a little ironical smile, a singular mixture of amusement and condescension. Samantha thought she was smarter than Riley was. But Samantha was n't smarter than Riley was. That was one thing he was sure about. <p> Riley and Samantha had made an agreement. She would get him a gun on the condition that he use it to take care of the squirrels, quickly and out of her sight. They had a cottage on Michigan 's upper peninsula. They were summer people. They were n't rich exactly, but Riley had a small inheritance and was making good commissions at the car dealership, which meant Samantha had been able to quit her job and was thinking of maybe going back to college and now they had this place in the country where they could spend the month of August. As far as Riley could tell, hardly anyone lived on the upper peninsula, hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were out in his yard now chasing each other, making what could only be called squirrel noises. They gnawed their way into his house, burrowing below the foundation and gaining access to the basement, making a racket in the attic, tearing away at the aluminum siding and the insulation, chewing on the wiring like strands of licorice, and generally setting up camp. Samantha had placed peanut butter inside traps and had nailed a few squirrels that way, but it was a messy process, especially for Samantha, who did n't take well to removing the squirrels from their traps, peanut butter still lining their gums. <p> Riley spent that afternoon in the woods around the house shooting at the squirrels. The red squirrels were the ones causing all the trouble. They were small, but they were fast and nasty. Riley took aim at them. He also took aim at the gray squirrels and the black squirrels just for good measure. He tiptoed around so as not to alert the animals. This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were squirrels after all, with brains so small Riley doubted you could see them under a microscope, but he was hoping to come across a few larger animals, maybe a hedgehog or a beaver or a raccoon, which tended to wander around these parts and cause problems of their own. <p> That afternoon, Riley shot three squirrels, and when he came inside, he marked down the number he 'd nabbed on a chart taped to the wall above his and Samantha 's bed. <p> " What 's that? " Samantha asked. <p> " A tally, " Riley said. " I 'm keeping track of the squirrels I shot. " <p> " Girls I fucked, " Samantha said. " Squirrels I shot. Men are always keeping count. " <p> " I do n't keep count of the girls I fucked, " Riley said. " It 's a stupid thing to do. " <p> " You might have done it once, " Samantha said. " When you were younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have, " Riley said, " but I did n't. " <p> " A lot of guys do things when they were younger, " Samantha said. " Things they do n't like to talk about. " <p> " Well I never did that, " Riley said. <p> " You did other things, " Samantha said. " You went to a whorehouse once. " <p> " I did, " Riley said. <p> " And you slept with the next-door-neighbor 's girl. The babysitter. How old was she? Fourteen? " <p> " Fifteen, " Riley said. <p> " You told me that story, " Samantha said. <p> " I did, " Riley said. He smiled at the memory of that. <p> " You 're no saint, " Samantha said. " That 's for sure " <p> Riley did n't deny it. He 'd done his share of bad things, some of which he regretted and some of which he did n't. " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " You 're right, " Samantha said. <p> " I 'm just saying one thing, " Riley said. " I never kept a tally of the girls I fucked. Not that there 's anything wrong with it. I just did n't do it. " And with that, Samantha went into the kitchen. <p> When Riley joined her a few minutes later, he saw she 'd baked him a birthday cake, angel food cake with chocolate icing, Riley 's favorite, and on it she 'd written " Happy Fortieth, Riley " with such obvious care that Riley took her in his arms and told her he loved her, and Samantha threw back her head and told Riley she loved him too, said, " You 're a good man, Riley Williams. " They ate the cake, first with plastic forks Samantha had gotten for the occasion, and then, when those broke, with their hands, finishing two-thirds of it in one sitting, at which point they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made long hard love on their king mattress, the icing still stuck to their fingers and trailing through Samantha 's hair. <p> The first thing Riley wanted for his fortieth birthday was a baby. The baby first because he 'd been wanting it for a while, practically since he 'd met Samantha. And also because on the question of babies Samantha was proving a tougher nut to crack. Samantha did n't want to take care of a baby. And she did n't like the thought of carrying it inside her. That was the big problem, the carrying part, the things it did to your body, not to mention the giving birth. Samantha was twenty-nine, which placed her, Riley liked to say, on the cusp of thirty, and thirty, he knew, was the magical age. If Riley had seen it once, he 'd seen it a million times. Samantha 's biological clock was ticking. When she turned thirty, the alarm would go off. Then she 'd change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Riley said. <p> " Not all women, " Samantha said. <p> " A girl turns thirty, " Riley said, " and her biology goes berserk. " <p> But Riley wondered whether the issue was just biology. Maybe Samantha did n't want to have a baby with him. She 'd never said this exactly, but sometimes when Samantha spoke to him, Riley sensed derision in her voice, and an air of mistrust that hovered over their relationship. Riley could n't pinpoint what the problem was, but things did n't exactly seem right between them. When he came home in the evening, he would hear Samantha whispering with her girlfriends in the kitchen, but as soon as they saw him, they 'd stop their whispering and Samantha would look up oddly at him. At night Riley played Scrabble with Samantha, and when he beat her, which was all the time, sometimes he actually doubled her score, she would give him her signature ironical smile as if she had beaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a laugh that told Riley he did n't understand the half of things. He did n't find this laugh amusing. <p> Still, on the question of the baby, Riley sensed Samantha was coming around. A few months earlier, he 'd gotten her to agree to consider having a child ; she told him she 'd at least think about it. <p> Since then, Riley had been turning up the pressure. " How 's the thinking going? " he 'd ask Samantha. <p> " It 's going fine, " Samantha said. <p> " You 're thinking, " Riley said, and, like a hypnotist, he 'd move his hands through her field of vision, as if he were trying to cast a spell over her. <p> To show Samantha his seriousness, Riley cut out newspaper articles on childcare. He got a book on babies ' names, looking only at the names of sons because that was what he and Samantha were going to have. He 'd even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous afternoon, while he was shooting squirrels, Riley had engaged in a little conversation with his son in which he showed the boy the art of shooting squirrels and of hunting animals in general. <p> Now, Riley was explaining to Samantha that there were ways to increase the odds of getting a son, ways practically to guarantee it, that had to do with ovulation dates and body temperatures. Position counted too, Riley said. <p> " Position? " Samantha said. <p> " Male sperm travel faster, " Riley said, " so if you get in the right position you have a son. " <p> " You 're making that up, " Samantha said. <p> For a long time, Riley had been trying to get Samantha to have anal sex with him ; it was another thing he was trying to convince her of. He 'd come up with a theory about the relation between anal sex and having a son, a theory having to do with openings and closings, with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a theory so elaborate and inventive he 'd almost come to believe it himself. <p> " You fuck a girl up the butt, " Riley said, " and you get a boy. " <p> " You fuck a girl up the butt, " Samantha said, " and you get nothing. " <p> " Well, " Riley said, but he did n't say anything more. <p> " You just want to have me up the butt, " Samantha said. <p> " That 's right, " Riley said. But Samantha was n't a fan of anal sex. She 'd done it only once, with some guy she 'd been with in high school, and the whole experience had been unpleasant. She had n't enjoyed it one bit. <p> " You 're an immature man, " Samantha said now. " You know that? " <p> " Immature? " Riley said. He was forty years old. He was as mature as he ever was going to be. He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd first left home she was still in grade school. Richard Nixon had been president when Samantha came into the world. Richard Milhous Nixon. Riley thought of reminding her about that. <p> " Yes, " Samantha said. " Immature. " <p> " I 'd take care of the baby, " Riley said. " You would n't have to do anything. " <p> " I 'd have to nurse it, " Samantha said. " And I 'd have to give birth to it. Do n't tell me you 're planning to give birth to the thing. " <p> " I would if I could, " Riley said. He grabbed the pillow from behind his head and placed it under his T-shirt in imitation of a pregnant woman. He was hoping to make Samantha laugh. <p> And Samantha did laugh, not the derisive laugh Riley had grown accustomed to, but a laugh full of affection. <p> " You 've been thinking about this, " Riley said. <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Riley said. <p> " You 're persistent, " Samantha said. <p> " I am, " Riley said, and he grinned at her proudly. <p> " All right, " Samantha said. She got out of bed and went into the bathroom. When she returned, she was holding her diaphragm case. She went over to the desk, removed a pair of scissors, and cut the diaphragm in half. " There, " she said. " I did it. " <p> " We 're going to have a baby? " Riley said. Samantha nodded. <p> " You changed your mind, " Riley said. <p> " What the hell, " Samantha said. " Happy birthday, Riley. " <p> " We 'll give it a whirl, " Riley said. <p> " We will, " Samantha said. <p> " Holy goddamn, " Riley said. " Jesus Christ. " <p> It was the good life for Riley those next few weeks. He shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could. They were going all out trying to have a baby, and now that Samantha had come around, she 'd gotten engaged in the whole process. A friend of hers who knew about these things said if you exposed a baby to music he might grow up to be a talented musician, and though Samantha was n't especially interested in music, was tone deaf when it came down to it, she decided that her baby would be a musical genius and that she 'd start him on music lessons as soon as he was born. " Our baby 's going to be a concert pianist, " Samantha said. " He 's going to be the next Mozart. " <p> " As long as he can throw a football, " Riley said. " If he can throw a football and learns how to shoot a gun he can play a hundred pianos for all I care. " <p> At a gift shop in town, Samantha got the manager to stock some baby clothes. She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, holding them in front of her to demonstrate. They were going to have the best-dressed baby in town, she said, the best dressed baby in the whole state of Michigan. <p> But Samantha was n't pregnant yet, and Riley wondered if he was shooting blanks. He was confident in his sperm, but not that confident. Every morning he asked Samantha whether she was nauseous, and every morning she told him she was n't. <p> " Not even a little? " Riley asked. <p> " Not even a little, " Samantha said. <p> " Well, hell, " Riley said. <p> " Do n't worry, " Samantha said. But Riley did worry. <p> Then, in the fourth week of their trying, Samantha had some news for him. " I 'm feeling nauseous this morning, " Samantha said. <p> " Morning sickness? " Riley said. <p> " Morning sickness, " Samantha said. <p> Riley pumped his fist in the air. " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am, " Samantha said. <p> " A lot? " Riley said. <p> " A little. " <p> " But it 's nausea, " Riley said. " It still counts. " <p> If the nausea continued, they agreed, Samantha would take a pregnancy test. <p> Above their bed, the tally of squirrels had reached seventeen, yet it seemed to Riley that he had n't made a dent in the squirrel population. They were still running about his land with the same degree of impunity, insinuating their way into the scaffolding of his house, going about their business in a perpetual state of regeneration. The other night, a squirrel had found its way into the bedroom, and in the morning, when Riley and Samantha woke up, the animal looked up imploringly at them, as if he hoped to be invited for breakfast. <p> Yet Riley persisted in hunting the squirrels down. He killed another squirrel that morning. In the afternoon, he had a clear shot at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he saw a raccoon. It was moving quickly through the underbrush. Riley approached it stealthily from behind a stand of trees and took aim. He shot at it once, twice. A high-pitched scream rang out, and the raccoon rolled over. Riley came up to examine it. It was big for a raccoon, and pale-skinned. It was a large raccoon, Riley could see now, perhaps the largest raccoon he 'd ever seen, an elephant of a raccoon Riley had shot, and this pleased him beyond all reason, until he realized, bending over to examine the creature, that this was n't a raccoon, was n't a raccoon large or small, but a labrador retriever, a hunting dog. Riley had seen them used when he was a boy, and how had a labrador retriever gotten onto his property, and Jesus, he 'd shot the thing, he 'd shot the poor creature in the neck. <p> " Oh fuck, " Riley said. He bent down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could get into his truck and take it to the vet. But once he 'd rolled it over, Riley saw the size of the hole in the animal 's neck and the blood draining from it. No vet was going to be able to help this dog. The thing was dead. <p> Riley cradled the dog in his arms and took it further into the woods. He covered it with a little dirt and left it there. He toweled himself off when he got back ; he 'd gotten blood on his hands and trousers. Then he got into his truck and drove into town. He was sweating something fierce. He bought a beer and tried to calm down. His pulse was up high. He took a walk around town and past houses he did n't know and into abandoned fields, almost getting lost in the process. He must have been gone for two hours. <p> " Where were you? " Samantha asked when he got home. <p> " Out, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was n't able to eat dinner, could n't down even a spoonful of his Sloppy Joes, and Sloppy Joes were his favorite. He hardly slept at all that night. <p> The next morning, Riley had Samantha follow him into the woods. He wanted to tell her what he 'd done, but he was n't able to, so he simply showed her what had happened. There the dog was, looking as it had the day before, only now, with the blood dried up and the animal turned on its side so you could n't see the bullet hole, you might have thought it was just asleep. The strange thing was, Riley felt better. He 'd made a mistake. He 'd shot a dog, a silly dog that had wandered onto his property, that had ended up somewhere it had no business being. It was like any other animal, like the squirrels Riley had been shooting the past few weeks, like a hedgehog or a beaver or a raccoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal less noble than a deer, yet Riley had proudly shot a deer as a boy and taken it home to make venison. He wished he had n't brought Samantha into the woods. He wished he 'd kept this a secret. <p> " Jesus Christ, " Samantha said. <p> " It 's a dog, " Riley said. <p> " I know, " Samantha said. " I can see it. " <p> " I killed it, " Riley said. <p> " You shot the dog? " <p> " It was an accident, " Riley said. " I thought it was a raccoon. " <p> " A raccoon? " Samantha said. <p> " That 's right, " Riley said. <p> " You thought it was a fucking raccoon? " <p> " Yes, " Riley said. <p> " Dogs do n't look like raccoons, " Samantha said. <p> " This one did, " Riley said. <p> Samantha stared down at the animal. <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did from a certain angle. " <p> " I ca n't believe it, " Samantha said. <p> " In the shadows a dog can look like anything, " Riley said. " Things look strange in the shadows. " <p> " That 's the neighbors ' dog, " Samantha said. " That 's the Buchanans ' labrador retriever. " <p> " I know, " Riley said, for on some level he did, though he had n't put the facts together. <p> " That 's Calvin, " Samantha said. <p> Calvin, Riley thought. What a dumb name for a dog. It made the thing sound like a human being. " I made a mistake, " Riley said. <p> " Shooting up everything, " Samantha said. <p> " Not everything, " Riley said. <p> " A raccoon, " Samantha said. " I do n't believe it. " <p> " I have no idea where that dog came from, " Riley said. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a name, " Samantha said. <p> " I know it had a name, " Riley said. By now he was tired of Samantha 's complaining. <p> Since when had she become such an animal lover? " You eat animals, " he said. " You had bacon for breakfast this morning. " <p> " I do n't eat dog, " Samantha said. <p> " Some people do, " Riley said. " Plenty of people throughout the world. " <p> " That 's the sickest thing I 've ever heard, " Samantha said. " Dogs are people 's pets. " <p> Pets, Riley thought. What difference did that make? He had a friend who owned a ferret. Some people owned pigeons. Some people owned pigeons, and some people ate them. That was the way of the world. <p> " You show no remorse, " Samantha said. <p> " I have remorse, " Riley said, but curiously he felt none of it. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said, " and look what you did with it. " <p> " I 'm sorry, " Riley said. " I apologize. " <p> Samantha walked several yards ahead of him. He followed her into the house. <p> Samantha did n't talk to him the rest of the day. They ate dinner in silence that evening, Riley pretending to read the newspaper while Samantha pretended to watch a game show on TV. It was only nine o'clock, but when the game show was over, Samantha told Riley she was going to sleep. She went into the bedroom to change into her nightgown. Riley followed her. She turned around while she was getting undressed so he was n't able to see her naked. The fact of this hurt him. <p> Samantha got into bed and turned out the light. Riley got into bed too. He could hear the squirrels gnawing at the house, then the sound of Samantha 's breathing. <p> " What did you tell the neighbors? " Samantha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> " The Buchanans, " Samantha said. " What did you tell them about Calvin? " <p> " I did n't tell them anything, " Riley said. " What difference does it make? The dog 's gone. Maybe he ran away. Maybe he got run over. They 'll come up with some story. " <p> Samantha got out of bed. She stared down at Riley with a look that said something he did n't wish to understand. She put on a pair of slippers, slipped a coat over her nightgown, and walked out of the house. <p> She was gone for a while, half an hour, an hour. Riley lay in the darkness beneath the covers, watching the numbers on the alarm clock turn, one after the other after the other. <p> When Samantha returned, she took off her coat and got back into bed. She did n't say anything to Riley. " Where were you? " Riley asked. <p> " At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over there and told them what happened. I apologized for you. " <p> " You did n't, " Riley said. <p> " I did. " <p> Oh boy, Riley thought. Oh boy. He got out of bed and, standing next to Samantha, simply stared down at her. " You 're crazy, " he said. He did n't know Joe Buchanan. The man was friendly enough, but he was a neighbor, that 's all. There would be hell to pay the next morning. " What got into you to do that? " But Riley did n't wait for an answer. He walked straight out of the house. <p> It was eleven o'clock. Riley was wearing just a T-shirt and his boxers, and had a pair of unlaced sneakers on his feet. He walked across the land he owned. It was a patch of ground, not much to brag about, but it was his and he 'd worked for it. The squirrels were his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peril, and he shot them to protect what he owned, his land, his house, to protect Samantha, for she was the one who hated the squirrels and had given him the gun to take care of them. He walked across the lawn, bare and gone to seed, and through the trees that surrounded the house and deep into the woods behind it. The sky was clear, the moon almost full. He found the place where he 'd buried the dog, and there the animal was, still lying there, untouched as far as Riley could tell, with only a thin coat of dirt on top of it and flies having settled on its flesh. Riley covered the dog with more dirt until he could barely see the animal. Then he brushed off his pants and went back to the house. <p> The room was too dark to see anything, but Samantha was awake, Riley was sure of it. <p> " You did n't pick up that dog, " Riley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Buchanans. " <p> Samantha did n't say anything. <p> You were just trying to spook me, " Riley said. But Samantha had n't spooked him. She could n't. <p> " I got my period today, " Samantha said. <p> " What? " Riley said. <p> " I 'm not pregnant. " <p> " I do n't believe it, " Riley said. <p> " Well believe it, " Samantha said, and she turned on the light, the flash of brightness blinding Riley for an instant. As he looked up at the bare bulb, he saw a mosquito buzzing against it, frying in the heat. Then Riley looked down and saw that Samantha had pulled the covers off her. " There, " she said. Between her legs was a blood stain on the sheet already having dried and turned brown. " There 's your evidence. " Samantha pulled the covers back over her and shut off the light. <p> Riley could see his shadow stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make out a sliver of moon. He thought he heard a truck rumble by in the night. A bird chirped outside their window. Then everything went quiet. <p> " We can try again, " Riley said. " There 's always next month. " <p> " I 'm getting my tubes tied, " Samantha said. <p> Riley said nothing. <p> " I 'm going to the doctor tomorrow morning. " <p> " Take your time, " Riley said. " Think about it. " And it came to him that he 'd been with Samantha for three years now, three years and two months and eleven days, if anyone was counting. And Riley was counting, looking for a day when a decision had been made, for the moment when he realized this was his life. Instead of what things had become for him, the minute accumulations and misunderstandings, the getting up and the day 's work and then the darkness. <p> Author Affiliation
