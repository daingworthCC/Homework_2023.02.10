1005641 My mother owned a lakefront cabin, not far from where the bodies were discovered. She watched from the back porch when the car was pulled out of the water. She could hear the steady clicking of the big tow chain, echoing against the still surface of the lake. Brown-gray water gushed from the windows and trunk and hood as the car rose up. The windows were partway open, and my mother 's first thought was that animals were probably in the car also : suckers and carp and catfish and crawdadsscavengers. The white body of the car was streaked with trailing wisps of algae. She turned away as the policemen gathered around. <p> There was a family in the car : the Morrisons. A mother and father, a seven-year-old girl, a five-year-old boy, and a baby, a little boy, thirteen months old. They had been missing since late May, over six weeks, and the mystery had been in the papers for a while. People around town reported having seen them, but no one had taken much notice. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the hundreds that passed through during the summer months. Lake McConoughy was the largest lake in Nebraska, one of the largest man-made lakes in the entire Midwest, and it drew not only locals but also vacationers from Omaha and Denver and even farther. When the police came around with the pictures, people thought they had seen them, but they could n't be sure. The investigation was bogged down by our town 's uncertain memory. It did n't occur to anyone to drag the lake, especially since reported sightings continued to come in from as far away as Oklahoma and Canada. Most people believed that they would turn up, and that there would be some rational explanation-despite the claims of the grandmother, who lived in Loveland, Colorado, and who had first reported the family missing. She felt foul play was certainly involved. Why else had n't they contacted her? Why else had the father, her son, not returned as scheduled to the real estate office where he 'd worked for ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father had a theory. He said that it would eventually come out that the father had embezzled a large sum from that real estate company. Sooner or later, he said, the authorities would catch up with them, they would find them living in a big house under an assumed name in some distant, sunny state. " Or maybe, " said my father, " maybe they 'll never catch them. " He paused, a little taken with this romantic possibility. " Maybe they 'll get away with it, " he said. When he heard they 'd been found, he seemed almost bitter that the idea he had repeated and embellished turned out to be so far from the truth. " It just does n't make any sense, " he said, and glared darkly down at his hands. <p> The two of us were out at a local bar, a place called the Fishhead that he frequented, and he was already several beers ahead of me. He was slurring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could 've happened. How do you drive your car into a goddamned lake? And how do you get it out there as deep as they got it? Even if there was a drop-off? " <p> " It 's freakish, " I agreed. I sipped my beer. " A real tragedy, " I said. My father shook his head : I had failed to get his point. " Do you know, " he said. " Every one of them was still buckled in. That 's what Buddy Battling told me, and he was there. The woman was driving, and she was strapped in behind the wheel. It just does n't make sense. You know, if the water had been icy cold, it would have been just, Bam! Hypothermia. But it was n't that cold. " <p> " Hm, " I said. It sounded like he was concocting a new theory, and I waited. The barmaid came over and asked how we were doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know what gets me, " my father said. He cocked his head at me, squinting one eye, and lowered his voice. " What gets me is your goddamned mother. Here this happens not five hundred yards from her cabin. But she sees nothing, she hears nothing. That 's just how she is. You know it. I mean, it 's nothing against her really. That 's not what I 'm saying. She 's your mother, and she 's not a bad woman. " <p> " No, " I said. He was drunk, I thought. I felt the alcohol moving thickly through my own body, and I could n't follow where he was going. I gave him the same one-eyed squint. <p> " You would think, " my father said, " a person would think they would 've hollered. Those kids. They had to have screamed, do n't you think? " " I do n't know what you 're saying, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not saying anything, " he said, but his eyes had a strange intensity " It 's just a shame there was n't someone else in that cabin other than your mom. That 's all I 'm saying. They would have found those folks a lot sooner. " <p> My parents had been separated for almost three years by that time, though they 'd never officially divorced. They had " parted ways, " as my mother said, some time during my sophomore year in college, I was n't even sure when. No one told me. My mother moved out to the cabin, and my father remained at the house in Ogallala. <p> I did n't quite understand the situation. My mother said that it had to do with his drinking-though, to me, he did n't seem to be an alcoholic, at least not in the way that you read about. He never did anything outrageous or abusive. He just drank beer or an occasional glass of whiskey, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant was that he was a little out of it after about nine o'clock at night. My father felt that it had to do with the difference in their age. My mother was ten years older than my father, and once I had left home, he said, the differences had become more difficult. It was hard to get a clear answer from him. He hinted that it had something to do with menopause( what he solemnly called " the change o ' life "). She 'd just-changed, he said. <p> Nevertheless, my father was out at the cabin regularly. All their finances were still intertwined, and whenever he got a check for work( he was a carpenter) he came out and gave it to her, rather than deposit it himself. It did n't make much sense to me. <p> The morning after our conversation at the bar, I woke to the sound of them arguing. It was an almost comforting noise, familiar to me since childhood, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been thirteen years old, or ten, or seven. <p> " Damn it, Everett, " I heard my mother say sharply, and I smiled because te phrase was so familiar, and because I knew it would make him blush and grow sullen. His real name was Everett, but everyone called him Shorty-he was five foot five, a compact, wiry little man-and some time in the distant past he 'd come to see this nickname as a kind of badge of respect, and " Everett " as an insult, a sissified embarrassment. Even my mother used it only in anger. <p> I heard my father mumble back at her, a low stubborn sound. He was terrible at arguing, he always lost( even when he was right), and mostly he was reduced to petty, childish comebacks. He used to flip up his middle finger at her. " Sit and spin, Darlin " ' he would say. For a while, this was his favorite final word. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had lapsed into silence. He was sitting at the table, moodily sipping his coffee, and she was at the stove, frying eggs, wielding her spatula with venomous precision. <p> " Morning, " I said, and my father raised his eyes and nodded. My mother said nothing. She flipped an egg and the grease crackled. " I 'll tell you something, " she said after a moment, without turning from the frying pan. " If you 're going to be drinking and carrying on until all hours of the night, you can stay with your father. " <p> My father and I exchanged glances, and he rolled his eyes a little. The issue was sensitive, since the choice of who I stayed with meant that one of them would feel slighted. The truth was that I mostly chose my mother, for selfish reasons-she cooked, and I had easy access to the lake. I kept my face neutral. <p> But no one said anything more. My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an irritated snap of her wrist, and I saw plainly that their argument had been about me. It was an extension of earlier fights they 'd had, when he 'd taken me to bars before I was of legal age. " Do you want toast? " my mother said, and I nodded. " Yes, please, " I said humbly. " With butter. " <p> " There 's oleo on the table, " she said, and put two slices of bread in the toaster. " There 's a knife by your plate to spread it with. There 's no butter in the house. I do n't buy it anymore. " <p> This was her " all-l-do-is-serve-people " tone of voice. And it was true, we sat and she waited on us- " hand and foot, " as she liked to say. On the other hand, if I were to attempt to fry my own egg, she would be right behind me, watching and making critical, disapproving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would say, " What are you digging for? " <p> In retrospect, I suppose that it was that morning when I first began to get a strange feeling about her. I realized that she must have an inner life-that she was a person who thought and felt and had memories and desires like the rest of us. But I sensed that there was something changed and hardened about that inner life. We had both become mysterious to one another, and I was aware that she was n't particularly interested in my adulthood. I was still her son, naturally ; but at some level, I was also something else-an invader, a grown-up mind that was beginning to commandeer the body of the child she had loved so much. <p> I do n't know if I was an adult, really. That spring, for a variety of reasons, I had come close to failing my final semester of college, and, at the last minute, had managed to talk my adviser into helping me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my classes, and, two weeks before graduation, packed up my stuff and drove home. I left on the same weekend that the Morrisons disappeared. <p> I took a job at a video store in a little mini-mall near the lake, some five miles down the shore from my mother 's cabin. When I was a child, it was simply a gas station and convenience store which sold canned goods and bait. But over the years, it had expanded ; now, in addition to the video store, there was souvenir " shoppe, " a McDonald 's, and a Domino 's Pizza. It irritated me, a little. " They " were taking over the lake, I thought, though I was n't sure who " they " were-new people, I guess. I spent my days feeling scornful and superior to the kinds of movies most people rented. <p> Everyone was talking about the family who had died. My boss told me that there had been a number of reporters around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was all a mystery. Had they simply run off the road, and perhaps been knocked unconscious before they hit the water? Had foul play been involved somehow? A pale fat man in cut-offs told me that he 'd heard they 'd been drugged, that it had been a mob hit-which, if true, never appeared in the papers. <p> What did appear that morning was an unnerving, posed studio portrait of the Morrisons, grainy and badly reproduced, on the front page of the Star-Intelligencer. They were all grinning for the camera, even the baby. The mother sat in front, holding the infant in her lap ; the seven-year-old girl, plump and obviously proud of her waist-length hair, sat on the right ; the five-year-old boy was on the left, his hair sticking up a bit, " a rooster 's tail, " my mother used to call it ; the father was behind them, with one hand on each of the children 's shoulders. <p> Looking at their photograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that car, under the water. I saw it as a scene in a Bergman film-a kind of dreamy blur around the edges, the water a certain undersea color, like a reflection through green glass. Their bodies would be lifted a bit, floating a few centimeters above the upholstery, bobbing a little with the currents but held fast by the seat belts. Silver minnows would flit past the pale hands that still gripped the steering wheel, and hide in the seaweed of the little girl 's long, drifting hair ; a plastic ball might be floating near the ceiling. Their eyes would be wide, and their mouths slightly open ; their skin would be pale and shimmery as the inside of a clamshell ; but there would be no real expression on their faces. They would just stare, perhaps with faint surprise. <p> I thought of all the times I 'd been swimming in the past month, and I felt a vague need to scrub myself again, as if that vision of them had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those unknown bodies had left a film on my skin. My mother had gone through the freezer and thrown out all the fish she 'd caught that summer, for the same reason : it seemed contaminated. I was sickened to remember the catfish-a scavengerthat she 'd caught a few weeks ago, and that we 'd eaten, breaded and deepfried, one Saturday evening. <p> People who knew where my mother lived would ask about it. I said that she did n't hear anything. I was n't back from school at the time, I said. I would talk about how strange it was. It did n't seem logical ; maybe the police would be able to figure out what happened. I honed small speeches for reporters, or news cameras, but I was never interviewed. <p> The police had stopped by to talk to my mother the day they 'd found the car. She said they 'd asked a lot of questions but would n't go into specifics. All she could tell them was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting there on our old cabin sofa, the policemen across from her. I could see the stiff, official way she held herself, her careful monotone when she spoke. She felt as if she were being judged-like she was one of those Kitty Genovese people, who sat in their apartments and ignored the cries for help while a woman was murdered in the courtyard below. <p> She really was that type of person. It was n't that she did n't care ; it was simply that it was hard for her to take the initiative in a situation that was n't her business. She would have assumed that someone else had already done what needed to be done. <p> When I came home from work, I only briefly mentioned the things I 'd learned : the photo in the paper, the television news team, the speculation I 'd heard. She rested her hand against her forehead. " Oh, oh, " she said softly. She shook her head, sadly, and was silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dinner. <p> At the time, this weird juxtaposition, her insistence on switching to the mundane, seemed like pure irony. Sometimes I thought that she was so repressed that she was more or less blank on the inside-or, at very best, one-dimensional, her consciousness a space where simple commands were given and executed : " Eat. Sleep. Make food for offspring. Sleep again. " Perhaps an occasional emotion or idea would flutter through, briefly, and then disintegrate. If anyone could fail to be curious about this horrific event, it was my mother. <p> This was our life together : dinner, dishes, perhaps a video I 'd brought home from work, which she usually fell asleep in front of. When I asked her what kinds of movies she liked, she shrugged. " Oh, I do n't care, really, " she said. " They 're all about the same to me. Half of them do n't make any sense, anyway. " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, she at last came up with Wait until Dark, about a blind lady being menaced by criminals. I brought home some thrillers after that, which she watched dispassionately, but with interest-sudden deaths, killers hidden behind doorways, screaming women pursued down endless halls. When it was over, she always claimed that she knew how it was going to end. <p> Looking back, I realize that this was my last chance to get to know her. I would never again live at home-apart for occasional visits at Christmas or Independence Day. Sometimes I ca n't help but think that if I 'd only been paying more attention, I might have been prepared for what happened to her later. It might not have happened at all, had I been watching for the signs that I can now only search my memory for. <p> But back then, whatever puzzles my mother 's inner life presented were not nearly as interesting as the mystery of the Morrison family. I called my college friends and talked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been picked up by the national news. " It 's pretty amazing, " I told my friends. " It 's almost like there 's no rational explanation, you know? " <p> I walked down to the site of the accident and examined it for myself. Here was the place where the car had inexplicably gone off the road. They must have been going fast down that curving dirt road-in the dark, one would assume, though no one knew. They had to have been going so fast that the young, man-high saplings did n't slow them down. They flew over an embankment-since surely, if the tires had hit the strip of sand between the low cliff and the water, they would have stopped, merely bogged down in an unpleasant but eventually hilarious situation. Somehow, the car sailed over the sand. It hit the water and sank. The lake was shallow for several yards before it dropped off swiftly. Somehow, the car got past that, too. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they sink? " one of my friends asked. He was sure they did. And even then, there would have surely been time to roll down the windows, even while they were submerged, there would have been time for at least some of them to escape. <p> When I walked along the edge of the road, there were no signs of any accident-no tire marks at the edge of the ditch, not even a broken sapling. Of course, almost two months had passed ; the elastic trees had straightened, summer plants had grown wild, rain had smoothed the ground. <p> As I came back to the cabin that day, walking along the line of shore, I saw that my father 's work van was parked in the driveway. He had probably stopped in for lunch. I came up the beach-side steps-which my father had built many years before-padding barefoot, quiet though I did n't necessarily intend to be. I could hear them talking in the kitchen. The sliding glass door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and their voices floated out, clear and disembodied as I approached. " Call her up, " my mother was saying. " Tell her that if she does n't pay you this week you 're going to take her to court. " <p> " I have half a mind to go out there and take down the whole damn addition, two-by-fours and all. " <p> " You should. " <p> My father laughed. " Can you see the look on her face? " he said, and my mother chuckled deeply <p> " I 'd like to be there to see it, " she said. I sat down at the top of the steps to listen. They were always at their best when they were talking business, making plans and strategies. I could n't help but feel sad, hearing them. It could be like this, I thought foolishly, we could all be friends, sitting around, joking, talking easily. That 's what it could be like. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father said. " Do you? " My mother said coldly. <p> " No, " my father said. " Not really. " He cleared his throat. " Well, then, " my mother said. <p> After that, they were quiet. I heard a plate being set down on the table. I got up and went inside. <p> They both looked up, startled. " Hey, Bud, " my father said. " What have you been up to? " <p> " Nothing, " I said. I watched as their expressions tightened, as whatever they were talking about was buried away, out of sight. I was coming to realize that I did n't really know them very well. Somehow, twenty-twoyear-old Shorty had fallen in love with my mother, a sharp-tongued, thirty-two-year-old telephone operator. Somehow, they 'd stayed married for twenty years, and then, abruptly, somehow they 'd decided to give up. It did n't quite make sense, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other mystery in my life. <p> " Do you want some soup? " my mother asked, as if I were a customer. Looking back, I wish that I 'd gone about finding answers in a more systematic way. I do n't even know if " answers " were what I was looking for at the time. Mostly, I was thinking of myself-where would I be at thirtytwo, forty-five, fifty-five? How did people go about falling in love, getting married, having jobs, families, living their lives? I wanted to frame my parents ' lives like scripts-plot, conflict, motivation, theme-anything that could be easily analyzed, anything that might give me a clue about how to proceed, or how not to. <p> Perhaps this was what I thought of as my mother and I sat on the deck, as we often did on hot nights. We sat, smoking cigarettes, staring out at the dark shape of the lake-at the lights of houses on the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air, which reminded me of the way the lit end of her cigarette would glow more intensely when she breathed in, and fade when she exhaled. <p> I ca n't remember that we talked, though we must have. Perhaps we spoke of the weather, or whatever mundane daily activities we 'd gone about ; maybe we joked about the " news " in those supermarket tabloids she liked to read. I believe that was the year Princess Grace of Monaco died, in her own mysterious car accident. We might have discussed that. <p> But it was the things that we did n't talk about that seemed most present. I wanted to know what she really thought of me ; what had really happened between her and my father ; what she was going to do with her life now. But it was if we were deep underwater-those conversations drifted over the surface, far above us, like the rippling shadows of rafts and swimmers that fish might notice, and startle at. I said, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year? " <p> " Oh, " she said, and sighed. " I do n't have any idea. I 'll probably just do the same old thing. Live here in the house, and take care of your dad 's books "( she meant his finances), " and try to get by. " She was silent, as if the process of " getting by " was fraught with secret perils. A couple of kids came running along her stretch of beach, laughing and calling out, their flashlights bobbing like will-o-the-wisps. We watched as they ran off toward the spot where the bodies were discovered. The lights dipped and swayed as the kids ran past, growing smaller in the distance. <p> " That part of the beach is going to be haunted, " I said. " Do n't you think? " <p> " What do you mean? " she said sharply. " Oh, you know, " I said. " The way people make things up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hmm, " she said, suspiciously. " Well, that 's the way people are, " she said. " Full of stupidity. " She looked at me as if I might be one of them, a spy from the world of the ignorant. She tilted her head back and breathed out a long trail of smoke. " I do n't think about it, " she told me, firmly, and frowned. I thought, as she gazed out toward the water, she looked troubled. The tall cottonwoods alongside the house trembled a bit in the breeze. She stubbed out a cigarette and lit another one. <p> This was the way my mother had always been, as far as I could remember, though you do n't notice it as a child-or at least, I did n't. It seemed the natural course of things. I ca n't really guess what her life was like, from day to day. I recall only little things, mostly. I remember how, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me put my fingers through the holes in those tight, tubelike curls. I would stretch her hair out to its full length and then watch it bounce back, perfectly, into its hollow shape against her skull. Then she would brush her hair until the curls turned into a kind of bubble around her head, perfectly round, like a helmet. She would hair-spray it until it was stiff. This was her late-morning ritual. She would drink coffee and watch television, or do crossword puzzles. When I wanted a hug or kiss, she would give it to me. <p> I do n't think she was ever vivacious. Her laughter, if it came, had a grudge underneath it. I have seen early pictures of her and my father where she appears to be laughing, yet still she seems self-conscious about it, glancing a little off to the side, uncomfortable. She is never especially pretty in these younger pictures-there is too much hardness and cautious ambivalence in the set of her features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glow about him. You can tell in his face, in the way he looks at her, that he is in love. He is a little in awe of her, it seems-as if she is an older sibling who will always, always outdo him, but he does n't mind. In the middle years of my growing up-between, say, nine and thirteen-she was depressed a lot. I knew why. I was told why. It was because of my sister, Lori, who died. <p> Lori was n't actually a real sister, though that was what my parents always called her. " Your sister, " they said. She was a stillborn baby whom I never saw. My parents had a grave for her, though, with a little headstone which they decorated with flowers on Memorial Day. There were, I learned later, a number of miscarriages between me and Lori, though none of them got very far along. Lori, on the other hand, was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and there was nothing, apparently, the doctors could do. <p> I remember the time when my mother tried to kill herself. No one ever spoke of it as such, but at that age I was old enough to put it together. I recall the ambulance coming to our house, the men trying to put her on a stretcher and her just aware enough to struggle with them-flailing her arms when they lifted her, her mumbled protests through lips that seemed claylike and unnatural, moving like a badly dubbed Japanese film. " No, no, no, " she said. " No, no. " I think now that she must have taken an overdose of pills. <p> My father and I were at the Fishhead one night, talking. He wanted me to play pool, and though I 'd never been any good at any sort of game, I agreed. I figured it was something I owed him, something a father and son should do together. <p> " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball I 'd hit drifted in between the colored balls it was meant to strike. " Good try, " he said, as he squeaked blue chalk onto the end of his stick. <p> I do n't know why this should have called up an image of my mother in extremis, but it did. Perhaps it was the way he glanced over his shoulder, edgily, worrying that someone might laugh at my ineptitude. Perhaps it was simply that we had been talking about her. <p> " You remember what she was like when you were a kid, " he said. " She was something else, then, boy! You might not have known it. She was intense. " " Intense? " I said. An image sparked in my mind-her, struggling with the ambulance drivers. Where was my father at that moment? Standing aside? Watching? I could n't remember. He leaned over the pool table and ran the stick between his fingers. <p> " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of things bottled up inside her. " He struck, sending a striped ball into a pocket. He stared as it vanished. " Ah, Markus, " he said. " You know I tried to be a good husband to her. You know that I tried to be good to you both. I was a good dad to you, was n't it. " <p> He was in the process of finishing off our second game. He named the pocket for the eight ball, defeated me again, and then took his glass of whiskey, clicking the glass against mine with a muted pride in his victory. " You need some more practice, my son, " he murmured teasingly. Little did he know that I had scored a small victory of my own-for as soon as we sat back down at the bar, he began to rub his chin ruefully, studying his own reflection in the mirror behind the rows of liquor bottles. " I 've been thinking, " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think she did it on purpose, that woman. " <p> " What? " I said. I was still thinking of my mother <p> " That woman that drove into the lake, " my father said. " I think she did it on purpose. She had it planned out, you see? That 's what they 're not getting. She had it planned out. Maybe the husband was in on it, too, I do n't know about him. But she definitely knew what she was doing. " " Dad, " I said. " Why would someone do that? " <p> There must have been something snotty in my tone of voice, because he snorted as if I 'd offended him. " Why do people do anything? " he said. He looked at me, a slow, drunken film over his eyes, a sad and scornful look. " Do you think you can say why people do what they do? They teach you that in college? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was older, it was something I recalled, that expression. It was the stare of a man who has realized that he does n't know his son, and his son does n't know him. He shrugged. " Ah, well, " he said. " I just asked, " I said. " I 'm not doubting you. " He put his hand to his forehead, soddenly. " I 'll tell you a story, " he said. " You probably do n't remember this, you were just a kid at the time. You remember when Lori was born? " " Yes, " I said. <p> " You know, your mom-she was real upset. She was having a rough time of it. Women go through a lot of bodily changes when they give birth, hormones and that. You 've been to college, you probably know more about it than I do. " He paused for a moment, and I shifted selfconsciously. <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't take that kind of course. " " Mm, " my father said. He gazed down, running his thumb over a wet circle on the bar 's varnished surface. " Well, anyways, " he said. " She was depressed. You know that. We struggled with it, I felt like... I had to watch her. You did n't know what she might do. She... well, she was at a point where she was a danger to herself. You remember. But it was hard. She had never been a weak person, you know, and... I was n't... I ca n't say I was doing so well that I could be the person for her to lean on. I never thought I 'd have to, you know, Markus? I thought she 'd always be herself-like she was. <p> " I 'll tell you, " he said. " I think about this one night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and I do n't know what woke me up but I suppose I heard her out there in the kitchen moving around. Those days you had to sleep like you were half-awake, in case something happened. She 'd tried stuff. <p> " So I got out of bed, you know? Maybe I was still part in a dream.... it must have been sometime after midnight, which was not all that unusual for her back then, she 'd wander around at all hours. But I had a funny feeling. And so I got up and I sort of-called to her, but she did n't answer. So I went out to the kitchen and then I could smell the gas from the stove. " She was n't herself then, Markus, " he said apologetically, though I was just sitting there, my face neutral and attentive. " She was n't even there, not really. I could see that. She was just standing, looking at the burners of the stove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I could smell it pretty strong. And then I saw that she had a cigarette-it was n't lit-she had a cigarette in her mouth, and she was fingering her lighter in her hand, waiting. Thinking about it. I do n't know what I said. I think I said something like, Honey, do n't. ' <p> " I do n't know what I was thinking. I do n't think I panicked at all. I guess-I do n't know, when she finally looked up at me, there was part of me that wanted to let her go ahead and do it. I loved your mom a lot, and she had those eyes. Those eyes, boy-I could do a lot of things when she looked at me a certain way. I just thought-a part of me thought-well, why not? Everything has gone to shit. Do you see what I 'm saying? It 's just a matter of a second. Like that family. The Morrisons, " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what we would have been. They would have writ it up in the papers, like Family of 3 Dies in Mystery Blaze, ' or some crap, and they would have yammered and gossiped and wondered.. " <p> " But, " I said. " She did n't do it. She decided not to do it. " My father gave me a tight smile. " I reckon she did n't, " he said. " We 're still here, are n't we? " <p> I felt my skin prickle. Would I have awakened when the air caught fire? I wondered. I saw myself, myself at nine, sitting up in bed as a red-orange cloud rushed into me, the flash of a single synapse. Would it have hurt? What would it be like, to suddenly cease to exist? I felt my back tense at the image of that bright red burst, that blotting out. What about me? Were n't they thinking about me at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What stopped her? " I said at last. " Why did n't she...? " My father shrugged. " That 's all I 'm saying. It 's a second. I do n't know. We might have looked at each other for a minute or five minutes-who knows? But then she just-turned off the stove. Walked over and opened a window. There was n't any... big scene. I do n't think we ever talked about it again. " <p> " Why not? " I said, and my voice felt hushed and ragged. I stared at the neon letters above the bar, which spelled out BEER. " What was there to say? " my father said. " What do you say about something like that? " Years later, I would try to replay this conversation in my mind, thinking it might hold some clue. I can only make up his words, though they sound honest in my imagination. I can picture my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awkwardly, on the sidewalk outside the bar, standing near our cars, and there was a moment when we might have hugged but did n't. " Goodbye, see you tomorrow! " " Goodbye, sleep well! " I must have gotten in my car and put the key into the ignition and my hands on the wheel. The night must have been dark, maybe with a little rain, and the thick trees along the roadside were heavy with foggy moisture, and the yellow line in the middle of the slick highway kept dividing, pulling apart like blurry amoebas beneath my beery gaze. <p> All of this must have happened, but what I really remember is the image of my mother with her lighter and the room full of gas. I remember a particular faux-velvet red nightgown she would have been wearing. I can see her naked, bony feet against the black and white kitchen tile. I can see my room, when I was nine years old, the taped posters and drawings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock polisher, all of that stuff is vividly imprinted. I remember television shows I watched more clearly than I recall what was going on between my parents. My mother was asleep when I got home and would have been angry to find me, stumbling in drunk at all hours, as I 'd promised not to. But she did n't wake. I distinctly recall standing over her bed, watching her. The quilt was pulled up to her neck, and she was breathing deeply, loosely, her mouth slack and vulnerable and innocent. Her knees were pulled up near her belly. Rain made a sound like sleep outside the window. She did n't appear to be dreaming. It was quiet. <p> I want to tell you that something else important happened that summer, that the mystery of the Morrisons was solved, that I finally understood my parents ' relationship, that my mother herself became suddenly clear to me. I want to say that I finally confronted my mother, shortly after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an in-depth conversation. I wanted to-I meant to talk to her. Meanwhile, I was very busy at the video store. I was going back to college in the fall, and I had to decide what I was going to do. I had this enormous, virgin expanse of time in front of me that needed to be claimed, and colonized, and strip-mined : my future. <p> And there was a girl, too, someone I met. She was staying with her parents in a cabin not far from my mother's-a recent high school graduate in the midst of her summer-before-college, seventeen years old. I think her name was Michelle. We made love on the beach, on the edge of the Morrisons ' watery grave. It was her first time, she said, and afterward I made a hole in the sand with my bare foot and buried my used condom-my seed, my potential sons and daughters sealed in their plastic coffin, earth tapped down gently over them with the palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a beach towel, silent and full of regret. <p> My mother, in her cabin bedroom, was asleep. She appeared in my mind, but I thrust her away. She was the one thing I did n't want to think about. <p> To tell the truth, that last summer I spent with my parents was soon forgotten-just as the Morrisons were, moving from the front page of the paper to the back sections, and, finally, drifting out of the range and interest of jounalists forever. I went on : I finished school, I took various jobs, I moved into different cities and apartments and shuffled through girlfriends. All through my twenties I kept thinking, " My life would make a great movie! " It was n't until I sat down to write it that I realized that it did n't amount to much of anything. It was just a series of disconnected incidents. <p> Then, almost ten years after the Morrisons, my mother herself disappeared. My mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone her for a few weeks, and then I finally called the police thinking, naturally, that she would be dead, rotting alone in the hallway between the kitchen and the bedroom, or sitting on the toilet like Elvis, frozen in a heart attack. <p> But this was n't the case. The cabin, they said, appeared to be abandoned, and when I drove out a week later this seemed to be true. Most of the furniture was there, but the closets were nothing but bare hangers, and the refrigerator was empty and unplugged. The front door had been left wide open. <p> In some ways, I suppose I was n't surprised. My father had died three years earlier, of a sudden stroke, fifty-two years old, buried beside Lori 's tiny grave. Since then, I had n't been able to get any perspective on the things my mother told me. She had been saying strange things lately-the cabin spooked her, she said, she felt like someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it, and finally she began to think that someone was trying to break in. Outside, she claimed to have found thin scrapes around the lock on the door-the new lock she 'd put in-and on the windows, scuff marks on the wood, as if someone were trying to jimmy them open. " I get afraid, " she said. " Sometimes, I get really scared. " That was the last time I remember talking to her. <p> Her fears had not sounded that serious, I have to admit. They were buried in a long list of complaints and worries-from her health to the new people who had moved next door-which had become the main topic of conversation when I called. I would tell her what I was doing, but I could sense her impatience. Yet she did n't seem crazy. That 's what I told the police when they asked. " Did she seem disoriented in any way? " one officer asked me, and I had to simply shrug my shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe a little. " I told them that last Christmas, when I visited, she had given me a bunch of old photo albums and memorabilia. " You might as well have this junk now, as soon as later, " she 'd said. " Keep what you want and throw the rest away. " It was mostly pictures of us when we were a family-me, my father, and her-and old relatives I did n't recognize, and gifts of jewelry and knickknacks my father had given her, and some of my old report cards and childhood drawings that she 'd saved. <p> There was nothing of that sort left in the cabin : the closets, the drawers, the storage spaces were spotlessly empty and smelled of Lysol. I found a nickel in one of the bottom drawers of her dresser. In another, I found an ant trap. The kitchen floor had been waxed. I opened the cabinet under the sink and found that she 'd put a fresh garbage bag in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was at that moment that I was certain that she was dead. A sort of terror slid over me, like a cloud 's shadow, and suddenly I was aware that it was night, and I was alone in the silent cabin. Outside the kitchen window, a certain tree looked like a human figure, standing there. The tree was at the very edge of the light from the kitchen, and for a moment it appeared to be a woman in a long robe-a nightgown, maybe. I jumped, and fled the house as quickly as I could. There are times, lots of times, when I think that maybe she is still alive. They never found her car, or her clothes, and her bank account was nearly empty. I can picture her, driving through various landscapes, her eyes straight ahead, her driving sunglasses reflecting the road. I see her living under an assumed name, in New Orleans, in Fargo, on a beach in Florida. Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have the quavering sense that it might be her. When there is silence at the other end of the line, I ca n't keep from whispering, "... Mom? " And yet, I do n't think she would call me, even if she were alive. <p> There are times when I would like to tell this story to my father. What would he make of it, I wonder? Is it the story of a woman who fell out of love with her son? Is it the story of a woman who realized that love was n't that important, after all? Or is it the story of my failure-my failure to figure things out, my failure to interpret, my failure to need her? What can you do with a woman like that, my father would say, and I would recall her wading in the lake, one day, about a week before the Morrisons were discovered, knee-deep in the calm gray water, running the tips of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue onepiece bathing suit she had. " Water 's warm! " she called to me on the shore. And if I would have lifted my head from the book I was reading I would have seen her expression, I would have seen what she thought as she looked at her son-a grown-up man, now-I would have watched more carefully as she walked into the lake, deeper and deeper, until just her head was showing. I know the lake was glowing with the reflection of the sunset. I know she was looking back at me. I know she was thinking something. <p> " Why do people do anything? " my father would ask, and he would dismiss every moment I thought important. He would ask me if they 'd dragged the lake for her body. And I would tell him, yes. And I would tell him that we had n't found her there, either. Wherever she was, she was n't there. <p>
