1015541 There are girlhood memories so vivid that you never forget them. Even now after more than thirty years I can see Annie Laurie Trujillo the day she came into our fourth grade class at the little country school in Los Rafas, New Mexico. It was late January. The new semester had started two weeks before. There was a thin scum of gray snow outside. Then in walked this girl wearing a winter coat that must have been tailored for a child millionaire. With a little fur collar and cuffs, and wool the color of camel 's hair. It was as unlike the homemade coat I wore as diamonds from coal. Unlike any little girl 's coat I had ever seen except in the movies. " Who does she think she is? " my best friend, Sonia Gonzales, whispered. Meaning the movie star coat and the dress underneath. The dress was much cuter than our Sunday go-to-mass dresses. Anyway, most of the girls were wearing jeans. What I had stared at even more than her clothes was her flaming red hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who could ever believe that color? Flaming red hair did n't go with brown skin and little country schools where kids spoke Spanish as much as they spoke English. Red hair went with pasty-white faces covered with freckles and snooty Anglo girls who lived in town. " I bet it 's a wig, " Sonia whispered. " Boys and girls, " the teacher said. " This is Annie Laurie Trujillo. " We could n't help but titter. What a name! Then some boy in back started to hum the song, " Annie Laurie, " and the class went into hysterics. " Students! " the teacher shouted. She always called us students when she was trying to get us to behave, exploding the word at us. " Students! " Banging on her desk with a pointer. " Annie Laurie just moved here from El Paso, " she said, trying to distract us from laughing. " How many of you have ever been to El Paso, Texas? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of us were still laughing and had n't heard, but I do n't think so. We seldom went into town which was less than five miles away. How would we ever travel 250 miles south to El Paso? Annie Laurie was n't fazed by the commotion. She did n't even blush, which would have been hard to see because her complexion was almost as dark as mine. " Sit right here, " teacher said, leading her to the desk on my left. " Rebecca can help you with the arithmetic lesson. " Then to the rest of the class, " Now students, back to work. " Annie Laurie stared into my eyes and flashed me a smile that said she wanted to be friends. I was n't buying any. The only thing she had going for her was her naturally curly hair which drove me into a fit of jealousy. My mother never had time to do anything with my straight hair. Especially now that Papa had gone " to sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had volunteered to be a soldier and had been killed in Korea the first month he had been there. But I did n't talk about that. Not even to my best friend. It was a dark, secret lump in my chest that I did n't know what to do with. I was an oddity -- the only one in class who did n't have a father. The next day Miss Movie Star wore another show-off outfit which we heard before we saw. She came down the hall with the same dress and coat as the day before. But this noise accompanied her. " Ka -- lak, ka -- lak! Ka -- lak, ka -- lak. Ka -- lak, ka -- lak! " Annie Laurie was wearing black patent leather shoes with taps. It did n't take long for the teacher to call her to the desk for a whispered talk. At lunch Annie Laurie went home and came back with regular thick-soled, scuffed shoes like the rest of us. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nothing but a fancy pants. " After that it was downhill for Annie Laurie. She wore the same coat, the same dress, the same shoes, and the same secret smile every day that week. " She 's a fake! " Sonia said at recess. " She 's not rich at all. Besides, I saw her whirling around showing off. Her dress went up so high you could see everything. " Then she began to sing : FORMATTED TEXT And she gave me a wicked smirk. Meanwhile, Annie Laurie was trying hard to be my pal. " You 're the smartest girl in class, " she said to me when we were doing arithmetic. " That makes you the leader. " Well, I did n't know about being the leader, although I did figure I was the smartest -- boy or girl. I did n't need her to tell me that. " Why do n't you come to my house and play after school? " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " " I 'm busy, " I said. " What 's your father like? " she asked the next day at recess. I froze. How dare she ask a question like that? I was so angry I could n't say a word, even if I 'd wanted to. Then she lowered her voice to a whisper, even though there was no one within twenty feet of us. " I do n't have a father. " She looked at me, waiting for a reaction. " Everybody has a father, " I finally said, feeling like I wanted to scream out the words. " Well I do n't! " She was trying to intrigue me, but she did n't. What she did was make me look at her a little more kindly because we shared something, even though she did n't know it. " So what? " I said. " If you come to my house, I 'll show you his picture. " Boy! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father that does n't exist? But I was curious. " Maybe, " I said. " If I can try on your tap shoes. " She did a funny little shuffle with her feet that ended with her arms outstretched, one foot in front of the other, and a bright, expectant smile like she was waiting for applause. " I 'll meet you right here after school, " she said. " Do n't tell anyone. " I ran off to join my friends who were yelling at me to hurry up. Next day I walked home with Annie Laurie. The biggest house along the way was tall with a steep rather than a flat roof. The adobe bricks had been smoothed over with mud and then whitewashed so it did n't have the dirt look of all the others. " Who lives there? " Annie Laurie asked. " They must be rich. " She asked me who lived in all the houses that we passed. The small, flat-roofed, dirt-colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned the name of one of the girls in our class, as if she was memorizing the house. Her house was one of the poorest of a poor bunch. Far back from the main road, over the main irrigation ditch, tucked in the corner of a field as if it were an afterthought. Or maybe an old corral converted for poor relations who had nowhere else to go. It even had the faint aroma of corral, I thought. Goats. " Annie Laurie, did you bring a friend? " Her mother made an entrance, sweeping in like royalty entering the grand ballroom. She wore a dress that was the adult equivalent of the dress Annie Laurie wore to school. I was too intimidated to wonder if that was the only dress Mrs. Trujillo had. " You must be Rebecca Montoya, " she said, taking my hand and holding it in the two of hers as if -- I do n't know what. " You 're the leader of the fourth grade class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but she just smiled sweetly. " She wants to try on my tap shoes, " Annie Laurie said. " Oh, " her mother said, " are you into the dance? How wonderful. See, Annie Laurie. I told you there 'd be cultured people here. " Into the dance? I thought. What kind of talk was that? And as for culture, I was n't sure what the word meant. Annie Laurie ran into the other room of the two-room house and returned with the black patent leather shoes. I forgot about being " into the dance " and " culture. " They were so pretty! " Here. Put them on. " While I did that, Annie Laurie dragged out a small wooden platform to put in the center of the earthen floor. The floor was the old-fashioned kind that you sprinkled with water and packed down and left to dry. My grandmother 's house used to have a dirt floor like that. Now everybody had wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filly anxious to take her first steps. I felt myself transformed into an elegant lady. A princess wearing magic shoes. If this was culture, I was crazy about it. " On the boards, " Annie Laurie said. " That way you can really hear them. " " Ka -- lak, ka -- lak! Ka -- lak, ka -- lak! Klak, klak, klak, klak! " I could n't believe it. I was Shirley Temple dancing with Bojangles. I was a ballerina. I was an eagle, soaring above the earth. I just had to have shoes like this, no matter what. I 'd give up Christmas and my birthday for a thousand years! Mrs. Trujillo nodded as she watched me thrashing about in a noisy and uncoordinated way. I stopped after a few minutes, sweaty and out of breath. " You have a natural gift, " Mrs. Trujillo said. " Does n't she, Annie Laurie? " Annie Laurie nodded cautiously. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should tell her? " she asked her daughter. Annie Laurie looked at me solemnly, trying to make up her mind. I stood in the center of the wooden platform, feeling myself being judged. Hoping that I would be judged worthy. Of what, I was n't sure. Whatever it was, I wanted Annie Laurie to say yes. Finally, after eons, she nodded abruptly. Her mother turned toward me with a secretive air. She spoke softly, confidentially. " I 'm going to start a dancing school, and you 're the first to know. " My eyes widened, and my heart gave a loud thump. " Can I come? " I asked, my voice timid and hopeful. Mother and daughter looked at each other in silence. " I should talk to your mother first, " Mrs. Trujillo finally said. " Oh, would you? " I pleaded. Meanwhile, Annie Laurie came over and pressed the fronts of the tap shoes, searching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? " she asked. Then to her mother, " She 'll have to have shoes. And an outfit. " " Whoopee! " I shouted. When my mother came home from work, I told her about the dancing school. Since Mother was a big, friendly woman, she did n't wait for Annie Laurie 's mother to come over. She went to their house right after dinner, leaving me to do the dishes and my homework. When Mother came back she was actually gushing. You 'd have thought the whole thing was her idea. We girls would have all the advantages of town girls. No more of this dumb farmer, country hick stuff.( And, though she did n't say it, no more of that dirty Mexican stuff either.) We would be as good as anybody. Better. Culture had found its way to Los Rafas. All we had to do( she meant me, not we) was to talk to the other girls. There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the class. As for money -- and here was the biggest shock of all -- it would be a pittance. I had never before seen Mother cavalier about money. She would add up the bill at the little country grocery store to make sure she was n't overcharged even a penny, while everybody behind us had to wait. It embarrassed me terribly. I 'd move away from her and look in the other direction, pretending that we were n't together. Nobody was fooled. " Your clothes will be so cute, " she said. " Red silk tap pants and a black silk blouse with the school name over the pocket. Les Danseuse. ' Les Danseuse of Los Rafas. " Well, I 've heard worse. Dance Your Ass Off ' for one. The name was n't important. " Will there be shoes? " I asked, ready to cry if the answer was no. Mother nodded. " Heather said that as soon as she got the money, she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, she has some used shoes we can buy for rehearsal. " " Hollywood! " I could hardly believe my ears. I was so excited. " And Heather 's going to start an exercise class for the mothers. We 'll get leotards in town. I 'll be able to lose some weight. " I went dancing through the house, unable to contain my excitement. Mother got on the telephone right away. She called all her friends, who included the ladies in the Altar Society and just about every other woman in Los Rafas. I finally fell in a heap on the ratty old sofa, breathing hard. Mother was talking to one of her sisters. She was going to lose weight, mucho pounds, and nab this guy at work. This was the first time since Father had died that I heard her mention such a thing. It was then I realized that Annie Laurie had n't shown me her father 's photograph. I puzzled over her mother 's name, Heather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ladies in Los Rafas. Tan face. Dark hair. Not a hint of red in it. Ladies named Dolores or Juanita or Maria. " There he is, " Annie Laurie said to me the first day of dancing class. The photograph was in one of those shiny, gold frames that you get at Woolworth 's. The picture was in color too. The first thing I noticed was his bright red hair, just like Annie Laurie 's. Then I noticed with satisfaction that he was not in uniform like my father. " When did he die? " I asked. " Oh, he 's not dead, " Annie Laurie said. " He 's in Texas. " I stared at the photograph again. Other than the hair he did not look like Annie Laurie at all. He had a pale, thin face -- no freckles. His eyebrows were almost invisible so his eyes popped out like raisins in raw dough. " He 's Scotch, " Annie Laurie said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then how come your name is Trujillo? " " That 's my mother 's name. " " But how come her other name is Heather? " Annie Laurie shrugged. " Her real name is Amorosa. " By then the other girls had arrived. Mrs. Trujillo had conjured a record player from somewhere and had put on some music. " All right, ladies, " she said, making us feel very grown up. " Let 's line up in two rows. First, we 're going to learn about rhythm. " Thus began the first of our weekly dancing lessons, followed by practice at home. The goal was to be ready for a recital the first week of May. By then our new shoes and outfits would arrive from Hollywood. Mrs. Trujillo had already talked the school principal into using the multipurpose room ; we did n't have an auditorium. At first the recital was going to be on May 5, the Cinco de Mayo, but the mothers nixed that. That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't work with the old-time " Spanish " people of New Mexico. By the time the Mexicans had driven out the French, which was why the Cinco de Mayo was celebrated, New Mexicans had been part of the United States for over twenty years. It was not a holiday we paid much attention to. So it turned into a May Day recital instead. The next night Mother came home from exercise class exhausted. Her black leotard, the largest size available, was n't large enough. She bulged here, there, and everywhere, and the poor thing could hardly breathe. I was worried because I had already lost my father, and I did n't want to lose my mother. She waved a flabby arm at me. Just a few pounds, she said, until she regained the figure that she had lost when I was born. That was over nine years ago. I saw how she packed it away at dinner every night. She could n't blame my birth for all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to spring. Mother actually started to lose weight, and Mrs. Trujillo told me I definitely had rhythm -- I was going to be a wonderful dancer. During this time Annie Laurie and I became friends. But she changed towards the end. She seemed remote. I did n't care that much. Sonia Gonzales was still my best friend, and my new tap shoes were coming in the mail from Hollywood any day. As May approached, Annie Laurie followed me one day after school. " I have to talk to you, " she said, looking around to make sure nobody could hear us. " You 're my friend, are n't you? I mean we 're a lot alike. Neither one of us has a father. " That was just about the cruelest thing she could have said. Deep inside I turned to ice while my face flamed hot with anger. I had never told her anything about my father. Everyone else in class knew that the subject was taboo. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? " You 've been nice to me, " she said. " You helped me with my math. " Who told you? I wanted to say. Who told you about my father? But I did n't dare speak because I knew I would scream. " If I 'm your friend, " I finally said, " why have you been watching me that funny way? " She gulped and looked away. " Because I thought you knew, " she said. " Knew what? " She continued to look away. " Knew what? " I repeated, raising my voice. When she did n't answer, I decided to wait her out, staring with one of my mean looks. Finally she said in this little voice, " It 's about my father. " What could be so bad about her father? I thought. She told me he was n't dead. Then I thought of the next worse thing. " He and your mother are divorced, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to hell. " That got a rise out of her. Her head spun around, and she glared at me. She looked like she wanted to hit me. But she just shook her head quickly that it was n't so. " He 's not your father at all, " I taunted. " He and your mother are n't even married. " Her mouth started to move in that squishy, loose-lipped way like she was getting ready to cry. Suddenly she pressed her lips together and gave me a defiant look. " No, " she said very calmly and firmly. " He 's in jail. " Well, that snapped the elastic in my bloomers. My mouth fell open, and I was immediately sorry for the mean things I had said to her. " How come? " I stammered. " Checks, " she said. " Bad checks. " Then she turned and ran. She never slowed down a bit, never looked back, not even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. After that, even though the recital was less than two weeks away, she did n't talk to me anymore. She drew into herself even though the other girls tried to talk to her -- especially those in the dancing class. She did n't pay attention in school, and the teacher scolded her for not getting her math right. Every once in a while I 'd catch her looking at me. I thought maybe her feelings were hurt because she had told me about her father, and I never told her about mine. But she already knew about mine, so what did she have to feel hurt about? The Saturday before the recital I waited in front of our house by the mailbox. I must have stood there all morning. Finally the mailman drove by in his little red, white, and blue truck. " Nothing today, Becky, " he said in Spanish. " Monday for sure. " I did n't know whether to have a fit or to cry. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing class and the families of the ladies in the exercise class would be there. Plus other people from Los Rafas. It was a real event, a first. What if the post office did n't deliver our costumes and shoes on time? Dress rehearsal was Tuesday night. I had n't even seen my outfit or even practiced with anything but beat-up old tap shoes. I had a solo too, and just had to do better than anyone else. I ran to the back of the house near the chicken coop where Mother was hanging the wash. She had a clothespin in her mouth and grunted at me, shaking her head, while I screamed at her. When her mouth was free, she screamed right back. " But my shoes, " I whined. " My costume. I 'll be the only one without. " " Monday, " she said. " Wait until Monday. Then we 'll see. " Grownups have no feeling for what 's important. I suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reasons why I 'd be the only one without shoes and costume. It would be all her fault. Meaning Mother. I knew it would be her fault for sure when her new boyfriend came to dinner on Saturday. Mother was acting so silly that I wanted to puke. Then they took me to my cousin Rosemary 's while they went out dancing. I had a sleepless night, wallowing in doom and gloom, knowing that my life was about to be ruined forever. The next morning I badgered Rosemary into going to the children 's mass. She would rather have pulled the blankets over her head and slept until noon, and she grumbled all the way to church. After mass I headed straight for the girls in our dancing class. I figured all of them would have received their shoes and costumes by now. Surprise! Not a single one had. We looked around for Annie Laurie, but she had n't come to church yet. " Maybe everything was going to be sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah. That 's it. She 's the one who took the money to order everything. The one who sends the money is the one who gets the stuff -- right? " That made sense. I made Sonia swear on her mother 's honor, hope to die, that she would go to Annie Laurie 's with me after lunch. Well, no one was home, not even that ugly, big old car that was a hundred years odd and sounded like a cement mixer. Then we went to my house, and I complained to my mother. " Wait until Monday, " she said again. I was tired of waiting, but I did n't know what else to do. That night I tossed in bed which was really the sofa in the living room. I could hear Mother snoring in the bedroom. In times past when I heard her I thought it was funny, but it was n't funny this time. I wished that we had one of those clocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was midnight. That would be the beginning of Monday which was what I was waiting for. Only there was n't anything I could do at that hour of the night. If I woke up Mother she would probably whale the dickens out of me. Finally my eyes got heavy. I was on the verge of sleep when I thought I heard a tap on the living room window. It was such a light tap that it could have been my imagination. It happened a second time. I rolled on my side and stared. The third time I sat up, ready to call Mother. Then I heard the low voice, almost a whisper, through the small window opening. " Becky. It 's me. Annie Laurie. " I tiptoed over and opened the window wider. " Shh, " I warned. " I had to come see you, " Annie Laurie said. " You 're my friend, are n't you? " I nodded although I was n't sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person who 'd ask a dumb question like that through an open window in the middle of the night? " I just want you to know, " Annie Laurie said, " that it 's not my fault. " " What 's not your fault? " It was hard to see, even though the moon was bright, but I had the impression that her face had drained of blood. " We 're going, " she said. " What do you mean going? " I was still sleepy and did n't quite understand. She stood there, her lips pressed tight. " You 're my friend, " she finally said. " I just wanted to say goodbye. And to say I 'm sorry. It 's not my fault. " Then she turned and ran into the dark and though I did n't know it then, out of my life. Well, all hell broke loose at school the next day. Annie Laurie was n't there, and her desk was empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school with her. The room was abuzz all morning. The teacher pounded her pointer on the desk until it snapped, and she screamed at me for the first time ever. " Just what is all this, Rebecca? What is going on? " I told her. But like my mother, she said we should wait and see. At lunch, instead of staying on the school grounds like we were supposed to, Sonia and I sneaked away. We wolfed down our sandwiches as we ran home to check our mail boxes. Nothing. Then we ran to Annie Laurie 's house and peeked in the windows. The place was empty except for the few pieces of junky furniture that belonged to the landlord. We ran back to school. My stomach was queasy, not so much from gulping down my lunch as from the wicked thing that had been done to us. The school grounds were empty, and we were breathless and sweaty. We hurried into the building and down the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I slowly turned the doorknob at the back of our room. When we tiptoed in, the room was even quieter than we were. Everybody had turned around to stare at us. The teacher stood up front, her arms crossed, her lips pressed, and her head nodding. My queasy stomach became a violent roller coaster, and I threw up all over Bennie Romero 's desk. After they cleaned me up, Sonia and I were sent to the principal 's office. The principal wrinkled his nose at the faint smell of vomit, but I did n't care. My whole life was ruined. I barely heard his sermon. I kept thinking of my new tap shoes and my costume that I would never see. I kept seeing Annie Laurie at the window, hearing her say, " It 's not my fault. " But it was! It was! " I understand your concern, girls, " he said. He lisped, which if he had been speaking Spanish might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their car and were stranded somewhere. " He meant Annie Laurie and her mother, but I could tell he did n't believe what he said. It was just more grownup talk. They think that kids are so stupid that we believe any old lie, and that just because we 're polite enough to keep quiet that we swallowed their bullchicken. " The mothers ' dance committee will be at rehearsal today. Mrs. Trujillo will be there too. Wait and see. " Then he told us we should never have left the school grounds without permission. We could have been kidnapped or run over or something else awful. He was sending a note to our mothers and now we should go back to class. Well, Annie Laurie and her mother did n't show up for rehearsal. The mothers who were there, those who did n't have daytime jobs, huddled in circles buzz-buzzing about what had happened. Then, after half an hour, the chairwoman sent us home and told us to come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I spilled my guts. She got on the telephone and all of Los Rafas must have been buzzing with voices of indignant mothers. Some blamed my mother for talking them into it, but Mother ignored them and kept insisting that the show must go on. It did. With makeshift dance clothes and practice tap shoes. One of the mothers banged away at the piano. The applause was wonderful, maybe because the audience took out its anger at Mrs. Trujillo by clapping their hands until they were red. I only made one mistake in my solo, and the other solos were almost as good. I never expected to hear from Annie Laurie again, and I did n't want to. But a few months later I got this picture postcard of the Grand Canyon. " We 're on our way to Barstow, California, from Gallup. Mama says they need culture there. I 'm sorry. It was n't my fault. " I tore the postcard into a hundred pieces that I threw into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, that I saw the good that came out of it. Mother did lose weight and married my stepfather, who turned out to be very nice. I had been infected with the dancing bug so that when I grew up I started my own folklorico group. When we perform I sometimes check the audience, looking for flaming red hair and wondering whatever happened to Annie Laurie. She 's never shown up.
