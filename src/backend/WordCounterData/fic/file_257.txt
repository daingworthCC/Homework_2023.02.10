5002941 # When the passenger aircraft carrying one hundred and seventeen travelers crashed, Garba was glad. # Planes constantly groaned low over his neighborhood on the outskirts of Lagos, flowing into the landing pattern as they approached the local airport. Garba had often prayed that one of them would fall within sight of his home so that he could visit the wreckage and look upon the expensive Woodin and brocade clothes of the unconscious rich. # It happened near dawn ; he was in the rift between sleep and wakefulness when he heard the sound through his window. " Ssshh! " his girlfriend said fearfully, grabbing his fidgeting hand to her hip. " Armed robbers. " # He raised himself up on one elbow, blinking in the velvet dark. The crashing bang of the aircraft sounded to him like the noise of earth-sized china breaking. # " It 's a plane! " he whispered, jumping out of bed. " Crash! " # As he switched on the flashlight on top of the file cabinet, where they kept their fashionable clothes, and hurriedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopeful voice if he was going outside to urinate, scared he would get into trouble if he went to the crash scene. # " Urinate what? " he hissed, buckling his belt and pulling an empty bluebonnet bag from a nail on the wall. " I 'm going to see the plane, " he said. " Continue sleeping. " # The smoking plane was a few streets away, near the swamp where restaurant owners often dumped spoilt afang and jollof rice. The softening sky was the color of burnt gold. Garba saw people milling at the edge of the ruined airliner. # A small cutlass swayed in his bag. He had not been surprised when it occurred to him to take the cutlass, which he would wield as a poker ; what remained confusing was how he had missed the signs all these years : all along his actual intention was to rob the dead, not stare at them. # He was not Nigerian. But was he now a kind of dormant-terrorist because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, after all, a full-blooded Nigerian, even if his father was a former cow trader from Benin who had taught himself Ifa divination. # The aircraft was hacked into five parts. One wing was on fire. A thick coil of smoke rose from the wing. Garba smelled burnt rubber and jet fuel, and the coppery stench of flaming flesh. He prayed he would not see any badly burned bodies as he joined the bystanders. # Some men grimly watched the scene, as though they wanted to help but needed direction. Others were already looting the dead. Garba was thrilled, because he could fall into the easy company of these accomplices. He knew several of them from his neighborhood. # Baby-Cockroach, who ran a small canopy rental business, had brought a long ladder and was climbing down from one of the plane 's smashed windows, clutching a heavy looking brown bag. Don P, who held a forked branch, walked along the broken left wing. Mandela, the local DJ, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a heap of insulation fluff. Everybody screamed : # " The owners of money are dead! " " Instead of them to take bus! " # " Look inside their briefcase for pound sterling! " " American dollar! " # Garba felt a jolt of rapture. # " When did you get here! " he screamed, moving toward his friends. # They hailed him, " Garbaaaaa! " with scattered shouts of laughter. Baby-Cockroach asked him, with a wicked smile, how he liked the bonfire heat from the burning wing. # This put him in a jesting mood, and he scratched his paintbrush moustache and playfully cuffed his wide sideburns, for which he was nicknamed after Gabbar Singh, a character in an old Indian movie. # " I swear to God who made me, " he shouted, drawing out his cutlass and his flashlight, " the heat and smoke are much but I love the smell of money. " # He stepped into a section of upturned fuselage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. He walked across the ceiling of the shadowy cabin. A lifeless passenger hung upside down, trapped in his seat by his safety belt. Angular shapes searched bodies in the aisle. Garba heard a fierce scuffle of two men fighting over a gold chain. # The smell of death was here, something like the stench of onions buried in humid earth. He was unprepared for it, and felt the urge to turn away and run home. He had to be at work at 9 a.m. after all. But he had come here to root for booty, and it would be a shame if he did not meet opportunity with boldness. # With his cutlass he nudged the pocket of a man built like a shot put thrower whose belly ripped open above his belt. Nothing. So he unbuckled the man 's warm belt and threw it in his bag. The man 's shoes were missing. The luggage was gone, too. # Garba wondered when the fire service would get here. Not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. As for the police, they were likely still asleep at their desks. Going into the cockpit, he struck gold. His flashlight beam found the pilot slumped backward on the ceiling, which was now the floor. The pilot 's face was covered in soot, and his crushed right arm sloped across his bloodied mouth, as though to protect himself from the onslaught of death. Garba read his tag : Kwesi Amoateng. A Ghanaian. For a moment he stood and gazed at the body, hesitating as though he waited for the crack of a race pistol. # Then he was peeling off the shiny Rolex and the belt. He pulled off the suede shoes. He stripped the titanium-white shirt with its golden epaulettes, and the creased poplin trousers, stuffing everything in his bag. He ran from the plane, sated. The watch looked expensive and would fetch a good price. The uniform was great couture for the church bazaar. This was the first crime he had committed since coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dysfunctional childhood. # Outside the crowd had swelled. People gripped their shoes in each hand, ready to bolt with lightened feet at the first breath of an explosion. Garba spotted two friends leaving : a young man called Incomplete Injection( because he was rumoured to have escaped the federal psychiatric hospital, Uselu, without completing treatment), and another nicknamed Thank-God-For-Daniel, who had received a motorcycle through the poverty alleviation program of a governor named Daniel. # He waved his cutlass at them, then jogged to where they waited in the crowd. Garba praised his friends ' better luck : Incomplete Injection carried a heavy-looking laptop bag while Thank-God-For-Daniel swung two denim-blue YSL suitcases cheerfully. They headed home. Thank-God-For-Daniel heaved one of the suitcases on his head. # " Do you know what crashed the plane? " Garba asked. # " I can categorically tell you, " Incomplete Injection answered, with an eager look in his eyes, " the plane crashed because of the fraud at the International Aviation College in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garba wondered if Incomplete Injection was even more lunatic than supposed, an invalid whose brain sat in a morass of its own perfidy. He asked himself how the man consistently held his salesman 's job. # The three friends joked about buying Hummer jeeps once they converted their goods. Garba put the cutlass away and grew serious. He said his room would wear a new coat of that expensive Dulux paint his girlfriend wanted, and he 'd buy studio time to complete the twenty rap songs for his demo. Music was his true passion. He was going to join the hit-parade, and then take his rightful place at the top. # Incomplete Injection said he would buy Garba 's album upon its release. # An anxious looking woman approached them on the snaking footpath. She asked Garba if the charcoal smoke that colored the sky came from a crashed plane. # Thank-God-For-Daniel discreetly slipped down his bag, as Garba nodded. The woman 's ironed burnt-umber kaaba gown and the immaculate white lace wrapper she tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and immediately he was offended by her superior luck. She was probably the kin of the lately dead. He saw how his friends hid their bags behind their bodies like clever three-year-olds, and felt annoyed that her presence made them timid. # As she zipped off in the direction of the accident, he scolded them for cowering before a rich outsider. # " I wo n't lie, I thought she could also be a journalist, " said Thank-God-For-Daniel, heaving the bag back on his head. " I kept waiting for her to ask where we got the bags. " # " I wish she had, " said Garba in a threatening voice. The group filed down the path. " You 're acting absurdly, " said Thank-God-For-Daniel, stopping briefly to catch his breath. " If she had wanted to search your bag, what would you have done? Are we not thieves? " Garba glared at him and made a fist. He seemed ready to punch his friend. The three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garba said with malice, " I would have slapped her. She is an... ah! I would not have allowed her! " This was not true and he knew it. Although he was perfectly capable of violence, like any adult in the world 's population, he excelled at reacting to violence rather than provoking it. But their recent adventure had made him giddy and he found himself playing the role of aggressor. What was there to lose? # " If I did n't have a job to go to at nine, " he explained, pointing to his wrist, " I would have waited for the commissioner of police to arrive, and I would have stoned him! " # " Stoned him very well, " said Incomplete Injection, nodding. Thank-God-For-Daniel warned Garba to quit it, Incomplete Injection might actually carry out his wish ; he wagged a finger at Incomplete Injection and advised him not to listen to Garba. # " Listen to me, " said Garba, enjoying his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like mine. You should go back there and wait for them. Once the commissioner of police arrives, you should rough-handle him. Slap him! Shout, stupid rich man! Do it! " # " Rough-handle him, " repeated Incomplete Injection with an indeterminate look in his eyes. # " Stop, Garba! " yelled Thank-God-For-Daniel. " When police catch him and find out he stole from the passengers, they will torture him and he will mention our names. " # The man of the moment gazed back toward the scene of the accident, as if he yearned to return there. Garba laughed. # He grabbed Incomplete Injection 's shoulder and said mockingly, " Do n't let your leg do faster than your brain, sir. Do n't go back there to fight police, or any etranger. " # " Risk is risky, " said Incomplete Injection, carefully. " It is risky not to take risk. " Garba briefly wondered what that meant. He dismissed it as dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Injection as they headed home. But a part of Garba was still mad at himself for saying " etranger " instead of " stranger. " Every time he said the French. # " Etranger " had been his father 's interjection whenever Garba did something wrong. # Garba had not been born into poverty, but from the earliest age had looked at his father 's seventy zebu cattle as his own inheritance. His mother, Omemgbeoji, was an Igbo trader who ran a thriving gold ornament and trinket business out of a narrow store in Balogun, Lagos, and often traveled by bus to the voodoo market in Abomey, Benin, to sell her wares to trendsetting stall owners. It was at this market that she met Affissou, his father, and she told Garba so many times that perhaps their marriage had been doomed from the start because she met the sleepy-eyed Affissou at a market where the empty skulls of wild pigs, large-fanged hyenas, one-eyed dogs, sloe-black horses, and the shrunken frames of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He grew up knowing that his father 's love for him was meager, knowing also that his father spoke the language of cows ; and whenever one of his father 's cows was stolen his father did not contact the gendarmes but simply walked around the market or the major streets of Malanville with a look of concentration on his face, making a string of short and long clicks with his tongue. # The stolen cow usually answered from the thief 's room, and then his father contacted the gendarmes to apprehend the thief. Later his father told the story at the cattle owners ' meeting, where he sat stone-faced on the elders ' council and regularly shouted down malcontents and inveterate brawlers. # Garba 's father resented Garba 's presence in the world because he had been born too early in the union, when Garba 's father still startled at the sound of the word " husband, " when he baby-stepped at the edges of matrimony as though he might fall off. He told friends he had been manipulated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used protection, but still the child had come. Although he repeatedly encouraged his wife to scorn the child, citing both parents ' conscription into early parenthood, he dutifully taught the child, when he was of age, how to stroke bad-tempered cows only under the chin, herding them by signaling from the flank. # Garba 's mother rebuffed her husband 's antagonism, and this friction was the cause of many battles. She told him she would not say, " Eat my arm, " when the child asked for more food ; and when Garba was eight and Affisou tried to force the child into the street past bedtime to buy him a baguette, she had gone after Affissou with a long-handled broom. # At nine his father put him in harm 's way during a lotus-picking expedition to Alibori River, though he had not perceived the affair as an attempted murder. He was standing knee-deep in water when the crocodile abruptly broke the water 's surface and appraised him with its dirty blond eye. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank, favouring the plumper flesh on the adult. Garba had jumped on the crocodile 's back, stabbing its blond eye with reeds until it let go of his father. # To his open-mouthed disbelief, in the year he turned ten, his father suddenly sold all the cattle and eloped to Nigeria with the second cousin of a celebrity potter who was on the back of Nigerian money. He and his mother moved into a two-room apartment where her modest trinket-business could cover the rent. Not until his fifteenth year did he leave Malanville to search for his father, after a brawl with his best friend ended with his friend calling him a " no-father, " a bastard. All his other friends had laughed, as if he deserved to be mocked. He had never requited his father 's loathing, but rather had hoped to win his father 's love by acquiescence. At any rate the size of his father 's many cattle had once given him a sense of power, and lent him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on, during stone-goalpost football. # He continued to hope that by some marvel his inheritance would return to him one day ; and on the morning he went to rob the plane, part of his motivation came from a subconscious desire to lift himself to the prosperous lifestyle his inheritance had promised him, a dreamy affluence he believed was his birthright, even in Lagos. # Stained buntings from last year 's " X-mas Carnival " winged across Garba 's street, like pale birds in formation, veering from electric pole to electric pole and flapping their thin ineffectual wings above him as he reached home from the crash. # His girlfriend squatted beside the Abacha stove in the passageway. An open pot with one handle, filled with beans and water, sat on the square of linoleum which served as a cooking carpet. He wondered if she had forgotten that beans hurt his stomach. # She looked up at him, a match flaring in her hand. Her gaze was mildly suspicious as she stared at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wall. " Goodies, sweety mi, " he whispered, tapping the hanging bag with his other hand. He hoped no amebo neighbor peeped from a keyhole. She lit the sawdust in the stove and asked him in a well-meaning voice to please put away his bluebonnet bag and then bring the container of salt from the room ; her request felt like a personal insult. Had she guessed everything? Should he lie to her? She could be annoyingly upright, and was loyal in a premeditated way. And it was this latter virtue that was her true failing -- her chief vice. Once she had seen him stealing water disinfected with Harpic toilet cleaner from a neighbor 's unattended bucket outside the bathroom, and because of this had refused to part herself for him at night, though she walked past the outraged neighbor and said nothing. And there was the time he tore the tenement toilet-washing timetable off the passageway wall when it was his turn to clean the toilet. She told the landlord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roster, then requested a new one and tacked it back with Araldite glue. # Garba looked for the container everywhere in the room. It was fitting, he thought, that she cooked with the Abacha stove, instead of the empty Butterfly bottle-tank under the bed, because her tone had conveyed that implacable, subtly unpleasant pitch of General Abacha 's. He disliked the crude stove which smoked through a square gap in the side, and which was invented during the hardest moments of Abacha 's reign when kerosene became almost as scarce as Uncle Ben 's rice and Nigerians resorted to cooking with a heap of sawdust packed in a container of Milo and sprinkled with a kind of kerosene obtained from the backyard treatment of diesel with edible potash. # She came to his rescue when he protested his cluelessness, and walked straight to the back window and grabbed the large De Rica tomato-paste salt container from the dusty ledge. He fell into one of the two ladder-back chairs, laughing. " You can never find anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you, " she said with maternal disapproval. " Are your Benin international eyes made of tin foil? " # She moved past the coffee table, where his bag sat half-zippered, with the salt container cradled in her hands like a cult figurine. " How many died in the plane crash? " she asked, stopping to glare at the bag. " People walking past have been describing activities at the crash. " # Activities, thought Garba unhappily. He would come clean. He could see the stiff knobs of her nipples through the tight " AM PROUD TO SUPPORT ONE CHILD " T-shirt he had begged her to stop wearing because her crushed breasts could encourage male neighbors. Like his own mother, she had a heaviness around the hips, the type that soon becomes a disappointment in middle age. He pictured her disrobed, her breathtaking hips -- which curved with the grace of a water pot. # He told her he had n't counted the dead, unzipping the bag as he laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a penance. # " Rich people and tragedy are like bread and butter, " he said unkindly. " God brought down the plane, and I went there to naked the victims. " # To her barbed commentary, he brought out the Rolex, the new-looking belts, and the other items, arranging them on the table. # " Garba, Pm sorry for you, " she preached. " Only God can forgive you, man can not forgive you ; Benin can not clap for you. " # She ordered him to bring the shiny Rolex, placing the salt container on the front window ledge. She slipped the watch on four fingers, examined it sternly, and said, " If only you can sell this fine watch and invest in a coffin shop, opened close to a general hospital. Or invest in your music career. It 's not like you do n't have talent. " # He said he planned to invest in his music. Even better, he planned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She smiled bashfully, admitting her pleasure. She went and kissed him deeply on the mouth. He raked her breasts playfully. She reminded him that the paint cost twelve thousand for a bucket. He said he knew. She handed him the watch, asking if he was sure that Incomplete Injection would not return to fight the police. # " No, " said Garba indifferently. " He said some useless jagbajantis ; but everything is under control. " # " Remember to take my new sky-blue jeans with you to work, sweety, " she said, going to the door. " The hips and thighs need adjusting. When Mother brings her grocery canoe around to the water settlement behind your workplace, give it to her. She 's a seamstress who never under-delivers. " # As Garba prepared to leave, he heard the morning fuss of some of his neighbors, the sweeping broom of Iya Mubarak, whose husband was a soft-spoken court guard who tried to pass himself off as a lawyer by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slapping slippers of Papa Okonkwo, who bred cats for a living, hurrying to the public bathroom behind the house to post himself by the damp-heavy door, so that his family of eleven would have first use of the backhouse before any neighbors. # Garba worked at a brothel called " UNICEF. " Expatriates from India, Pakistan, Lebanon, China, and the Philippines, who drove the labor at the neighboring factories and who had left wives and tangled domestic fortunes back in their home countries flung themselves into the soft arms of the whorehouse, and this international patronage was probably the reason for the brothel 's name. # Garba was the booze manager, purchasing cartons of Star and Gulder from the swaying supply trucks which came by twice a week. The barman answered to him. The girls also paid their monthly rent to him( which he passed on to Onyinye, the brothel owner), and once, when the girls wanted DStv cable installed in their rooms, he had been the one they asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your dreams to a shoddy one-room apartment. Garba saw this job as a way station to greener fields. His hostility toward rich people did not extend to hostility toward riches. He knew, deep inside, that this antagonism rose from old jealousy. He had lost his inheritance, the zebu cattle, when his father moved to Nigeria. It hurt him that other privileged people had not shared his misfortune. # Here, he was called Kerekou, after the former Benin president. It was common knowledge among staff that he was an immigrant from " Cotonou ; " but he loved the moments when he mingled with the expatriate patrons because he could pass himself off as Nigerian. # When he arrived, some of the girls sat on the cracked wooden benches in the bar discussing the plane crash. The smell of stale beer and cigarette ash hung heavy in the air. # " Kerekou, " said a lithe girl whose elbows were on the table. " Did you hear of the crash? Millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. # " No, " answered Garba, frowning. He placed his bluebonnet bag carefully on the cluttered bar top. Inside the bag were the shoes, belts, the Rolex watch he hoped to sell. # He began to look through the sales book, and opened the tall fridge to crosscheck the number of drinks sold last night with those in stock. The girls were describing the accident in high excited voices and he struggled not to pay attention to any details. " Animals who call themselves human beings were looting dead people! " cried one girl. # " May Bermuda Triangle relocate to the lives of those men who robbed dead people! " # Garba tried to keep a tranquil face, but inside he was a crushed ant hobbling on the floor. # " Some of those you call animals might just be poor people taking from the rich, " he said miserably. # " Please! Please! Please! " cried the girls in irritation. # He was glad to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garba that they had agreed to talk business today. Garba quickly stowed his bag under the table and went outside with the man. # On the street two little boys in matching Superman underpants played a game of improvised-bowling, flinging dry maize cobs at a serried row of empty milk cans. # Garba recalled that the man wanted to talk about cheap " beer production, " and now he heard the man begin to describe an operation where " 33 " beer would be emptied into " Star " bottles, and sold as " Star. " Fantastic profit since " Star " sold for twice the price of " 33. " # Garba hissed angrily, and the man stepped back. He told the fellow that deceiving any man or tranger about his beer was like promising a soldier big guns in battle only to arm him with a knife handle. " It 's never done, " he said righteously, and stomped back into the brothel. # The girls were no longer at the bar. He sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a soft smile. When the university boys -- who carried around substantial cash -- showed up, he would try to sell them the shoes and the belts. He did not think they could afford the Rolex. Its gold face and the gold band in its silver strap spoke of its high worth. But they would know other wealthy people. A complex sense of brotherly duty kept him from considering approaching the expatriates with his goods. Fellow-foreigners. It would be like stealing from a sibling. # The barman showed up in his frayed, iron-burnt tuxedo. Garba zipped closed the bag and asked him if he had heard about the crash. The man said no, and Garba fed him a fairy tale that had him throwing off people trying to steal from the dead. He switched on the Kenwood CD/cassette player on top of the fridge as customers streamed in. He hummed along to a Tupac song and playfully translated the lyrics in ungrammatical French( Biggie Smalls, Junior Mafia et maquette-brule salope!) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green-yellow rosary beads on his neck, and had tried to learn pidgin English but only knew how to say, You mumu mumu well well. I think you mumu. Soon Garba spotted some of the university boys in their shiny sneakers and graphic T-shirts. He went to them in the corner where they sat smoking Consulates, and showed them the goods. He told them that an uncle who lived in France had sent the gifts. Garba wanted to offload the articles because he needed to foot the funeral costs of his girlfriend 's dead mother( his voice grew brittle in momentary regret at this lie). The shoes were Italian suede, and one could wear them to church on Sunday looking like a bank manager. A boy called Alubarika Kafka paid twenty thousand naira for the stuff. # When Garba showed him the watch, he told Garba it might fetch as much as " One hundred and fifty thou ', " and Garba whistled in delight. He gave Garba the address of a Barbadian lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrilled at the sale. Now he could take the money to the studio and speak confidently to MC Microphone Conductor about his album. # Near noon he jammed his girlfriend 's trousers under his armpit and went to meet her mother. The water settlement bristled with solid wooden houses that squatted on slender raw-umber stilts. The surrounding area had been converted to an illegal rubbish dump, and as Garba crushed plastic bottles and engorged polythene bags under his feet, he told himself that the foul smell that hung off the rubbish was his punishment for inventing an uncle who lived in France, in his sales pitch, instead of one who lived in America, like a Nigerian would. As much as he wanted his cultural references to spring from his host culture, he often found himself in a default setting where all of life 's instructions were in French. He wondered if his father was caught in the same difficulty, up there in the north where he probably lived in a small house fenced by lean millet stalks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inky water, and stepped onto the boardwalk. His girlfriend 's mother ran what was essentially a floating supermarket and at noon brought her wares to the west of the water, after she had served the east side settlement in the morning. She had seen three daughters through school with proceeds from this trade, and every Christmas had bought them imported " ready-made " dresses from bell-ringing stall owners at Aswani market. # The woman did not like Garba because he was a non-native, and some of Garba 's natural good humor evaporated while he stood in the boardwalk and waited for her loaded canoe. He could make out a large food cooler wrapped around with clear plastic to preserve heat. A red Singer Featherweight sat next to a custard bucket that he knew contained several shampoo bottles filled with a compound of sulphur, ground glass, gunpowder, and palm-kernel oil, which she sold to teenage girls for the removal of acne. At the rear was a large basket crammed with old wine bottles filled with palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boat would see that he had greeted first, and when she did not respond, simply bending forward with the paddle to cut languid silver lines in the water, he felt justified for wishing her dead. # He handed the trousers over when she reached him and greeted the pouting woman again. # She replied calmly, " How many ears do you have, please say meji? " # " Meji. " # " So why are Benin men known for jolly-jolly sexual safari with plenty girls? " # " Ma, no. We 're not like that. " # " Hmmm. The day I catch you cheating on my daughter, that 's when you 'll know that you 've been playing with oka, cobra. " She pointed her oar at him to show she was serious, then paddled away. # It amused him that while his foreignness was the thing his girlfriend liked the most -- because he was " imported, " he guessed, and she could boast to friends at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an " international " boyfriend -- it was this same peculiarity that his girlfriend 's mother repudiated. # He recalled how Kerekou had adopted Marxism-Leninism when he first began to rule Benin, then about-faced once Marxism-Leninism failed, running to the capitalist IMF. Nigeria had suffered inverted fortunes too. When it used to be very rich in the ' 70s, people from all over Africa, like sugar ants, immigrated to Nigeria ; but after the oil price fell in the ' 80s, Nigeria chased out legions of West Africans. Thousands of Benin citizens were pushed over the border like cattle. Today, South Africa was the new Nigeria, and every day many Nigerians emigrated to Cameroon, Ghana, Gabon, and even Benin. It gave him a kind of wicked satisfaction to see the tables turned. # Garba got away from work at two, and went to see MC Microphone Conductor. Microphone Conductor mixed and recorded songs in his living room. Artistes stood outside in the bright sun screaming ballads, their microphone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Soon he was discussing his project with Microphone Conductor : twenty bad songs this time, not like the last time when he could only pay for one studio session. He had come into some inheritance money because an aunt in Paris, who had a crazy son named Incomplete Injection( he tried not to laugh), had died in a plane crash. He told Microphone Conductor that he wanted to pay for a studio practice session now, since he had an idea for a song. After he handed the money over, Microphone Conductor smiled and set him up. # Garba gripped the bulky Shure Dynamic microphone tenderly. He thought of how proud his girlfriend, his wide-hipped sweety mi, would be when he blew. She 'd force her mother to reverse her disapproval. Her mother would fall over herself to please him ; but he 'd stall -- and give conditions for his forgiveness. Even his own mother, whom he had not seen in close to ten years, would be over the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the PO Box of a nearby cinema as his own address, and had received a reply in shaky handwriting, accusing him of abandoning her, asking for a safe address where she could send him a gift. He had wondered if she cried as she wrote the letter. He often questioned whether she was alive, but trusted that her zest for justness would keep her breathing. He would rap about money. Money! # Money! Money! Ayatollah Money! The bomb chorus. A Jay-Z instrumental began to play. # On his way back to work, he saw a crowd of gabbling men gathered at a table where a vendor sold evening newspapers. Even before he reached them, he knew they were discussing the crash. # " The plane has a pilot, " said one man angrily, " and the pilot has an employer, and the employer has a company that can be brought to justice for killing innocent people. " Garba, peered behind the man at a newspaper headline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. CRIMINALS STEAL FROM VICTIMS. POLICE CATCH ONE. " # He felt a pang of humiliation and guilt at seeing the word, " criminal. " This was jagbajantis journalism. He did not even own a gun, nor did he lick gbana cocaine every morning. Did these men think he was a criminal? He scratched his sideburns desperately, looking around. But the men argued amongst themselves and paid him no mind. # When he read the paper halfway, he saw something that almost made his head explode. The account described a man carrying a heavy stone who ordered a policeman at the site to leave quickly and allow people to " collect " from the rich, or he would drop the stone on the officer 's legs. The policeman had slapped the man, and arrested him. A police inspector said, " This is a very serious case because the officer could have been assassinated. We suspect the man as one of those hoodlums who robbed the dead victims. Only further investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in question was not Incomplete Injection. He should have heeded Thank-God-For-Daniel 's warning. As a child his mother had repeatedly told him he was quick-witted but unwise, and now this foolishness looked to have landed him in trouble. The police were expert torturers, and even Jesus would sing like a bird in their iron grip. Incomplete Injection might give the police Garba 's name. He could not believe how quickly a sweet day grew into a day of hardship. # He was moved by the memory of an excellent day that had quickly turned terrible : the day his father took him to Alibori River and he had fought a crocodile. He prayed he would pull through his present ordeal as he had survived the crocodile 's whipping tail, and longed for the comforting nearness of his mother. # He had injured his brow and hand after jumping on the crocodile 's back, and his mother tended the swollen hand by applying daily warm compresses and feeding him doses of vinegar, often cursing as she worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. She would ask if he was her " little baby, " and he would nod happily. Did he remember what fun they had the day they made poulet la sauce? Should they go to a church crusade at the stadium? She 'd hold his hand and they 'd go to a fine miracle crusade. Watch the crippled jump out of wheelchairs. The blind shout, Bleu! Jaune! She had accused his father of attempted murder, since every adult knew that the Alibori had been invaded by rogue crocodiles, and, despite her forgiving nature, she 'd refused to visit him in hospital where he recovered from the deep gash in his thigh. # The day Garba left Benin was his mother 's birthday, chosen for serendipity. His newly broadened chest, and the recent deepening of his voice convinced him that he could shoulder his own destiny without adult supervision. He would miss his mother 's sound judgment, he knew, her obsessive protection, which secretly amused him. He had gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location from a Togolese who had worked as a ball boy at a tennis club in Lagos, and had seen Garba 's father on a trip to northern Nigeria. Garba sat a geography textbook on his thigh and drew a line from Malanville to Kebbi on a map of West Africa. Thus he plotted his itinerary. He had saved money from working part-time at one of the textile stores in the market, and with this bought passage on a TATA truck that buried illegal immigrants among its cargo of red Hanagamba cattle. He had not planned what he would say to his father, but he was eager to go because he imagined that he lacked a social and emotional core which only a father could fill. # He had learned English from his mother, but getting to northern Nigeria, he found the language useless for asking directions, because the koine was Hausa, which he did not speak. Since he was also running out of money, he went down south with the ubiquitous Young Shall Grow buses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father, in the south he could use his English and earn some cash. His first job was as a helper at the Ezamgbo donkey market in Ebonyi. He fed the Auraki and Idabari donkeys dry grass supplemented with kanwa, a kind of nutritional soda ash, but found, disappointingly, that they suffered poor digestion ; unlike his father 's zebu cattle which had regularly turned garbage into gold. Dreams of finer wages brought him to Lagos, but he could not stand the noise in the city. # People spoke too fast, and were aggressive, even when offering charity. Nothing like he had encountered in Benin where his experience of Nigerians was limited to the hardworking but often cunning traders at Malanville market, many of them Igbos( like his own mother). # He had channeled Lagos 's noise into music, and held a string of poor-paying jobs at various private schools where he taught French and current affairs. Garba told himself that when the time came to resume the search for his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give him the sign, in the same way a mishap had started him on his journey. # A gentle bulb lighted the passageway when Garba returned home from work. It seemed to him that he hauled, inside his chest, the weight of the world. On the kabukabu ride he had faced the sloping window and listed to himself, in a worn judicial voice, thirty-five reasons why the man in the newspaper was not Incomplete Injection. # He saw that the Pepsi bottle, with its precious inch of kerosene, had been left outside since morning where it could be stolen by one of the bachelor-neighbors. # Garba sighed at his girlfriend 's negligence and took the bottle inside. She was home. With a friend. # He did not know her. In the ghostly flash of the four-legged TV the friend 's face looked like the harsh mask of a waiting detective. # " You lost your way? " his girlfriend joked, standing up from the bed. She wore an off-the-shoulder dress that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, too. " We 've been waiting for you, " said his girlfriend. " This is my friend who just started working not long ago at our Motherless Babies Home, and in fact this morning, near Universal Trust Bank, we saved an abandoned baby in an old sackcloth. " She and the girl, who had ample hips like her, smiled smugly at each other. Garba looked from one to the other, their matching contours giving him the implausible illusion that his girlfriend projected an empty substitute. She continued, " My friend wants to enter the Cotonou smuggling business to supplement income from work, which is unspeakably poor as you know. She needs advice. Where in Benin can she get the cheapest goods to sell? " # Garba listened uneasily as the girl spoke of smuggling cartons of California wine, jerry cans of petrol, used tires, mosquito coils, vegetable oil, toothpicks, and frozen chicken. # It was awful to hear his own voice as he struggled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a police spy sent to entrap him in some sideways plan connected to his morning escapade. He vowed to confuse the police. # " Smugglers hide in the bush with frozen chicken, " he said truthfully, his look tentative. " They pour embalming fluid on the chickens to stop them from rotting and prepare to outwait customs officers at the border for weeks. " The girl nodded, unperturbed. Garba cursed under his breath, and wondered how he might escape. He spotted his supper on the coffee table. He began to eat the cornmeal and crayfish and walked out of the room, carrying the dish. # He sat on the concrete edge of the backyard well and licked yellow cornmeal off his fingers. He could see neighbors ' washing hung out on the line, upside down shirts, and a broad towel which carefully concealed a girl 's row of sweat-blackened panties. Above him, the starry sky curved like the inside of a jeweled umbrella. He had decided to come to Nigeria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flatten time and slide down to the year he turned fifteen. Even though he had not confirmed that Incomplete Injection was the suspect in the newspaper story, and had no way of telling if the police were on his heels, he pictured himself shot by the police in a capture operation gone wrong. He did not want to die in Nigeria. Ghanaians believed that if one ate the head of a cat one could never die in a foreign land. He wondered if he should abduct one of his neighbor 's cats in the cage beside the fence and braise its head. # The girl was gone when he returned to the room, and his girlfriend leaned on the front window, near the TV, and gave him a look of distant dismissal. # " The police are after me, sweety mi, " he said, exaggerating. " In the papers today I read they 've caught Incomplete Injection. " He told her he had sold all the articles except the Rolex. The pilot 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed. Garba placed the empty dish on top of the file cabinet against the wall, turned on the light, and began to take off his clothes. # He sat on the bed in his pepper-red boxers and together they watched the late news in worried silence. There was a special report on the crash. Smoke rose lazily out of the plane 's wing. Policemen in orange reflective vests beat back the crowd, clearing a path for a flashing fire truck and a long white van belonging to the Lagos State Security Trust Fund. A visibly angry spokesperson for the police said, " Criminals came, stealing from dead people. We got here only to see scattered papers, ransacked documents. Not a single bag. We have made some arrests, and we are on the trail of the other looters. " Garba 's girlfriend turned off the television by jerking the plug from the wall. # She asked him if he was sure that Incomplete Injection was the suspect mentioned in the paper ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact unnamed, but the person had threatened to stone the police, just as he instructed Incomplete Injection, she sighed wearily and placed her palm on his shoulder. # " What are you going to do now? " she asked. # In bed the question gnawed at him like a rat 's slow teeth working the edge of a kitchen door. Was imminent flight the answer? And why had his girlfriend separated herself from his hardship? He recalled how, when he first came to Lagos, he used to go to viewing centers each day at 5 p.m., to watch -- for fifty naira -- international football matches, available only via cable, on twenty-one inch LG screens. One time there was a CAF Champions League match between Mogas 90 FC, Cotonou, and Julius Berger FC, Lagos. His was the single unwise voice roaring Mogas 90 to victory in the crowded room. An area boy had asked to see him outside, wanting to know why he rooted for the Beninoise club. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly slapped him. He had screamed, " My mother! " shocked. Garba turned around in the dark and studied his girlfriend 's face. # In the morning she asked him to give her five thousand naira to replenish their foodstuff. He gave her cash from his loot sale, then left for work. At the bar the thought of feeling exposed to capture was unendurable. He crouched down intermittently beside the fridge, arranging empty beer bottles. # In the afternoon he was visited by a panicked Thank-God-For-Daniel. # Thank-God-For-Daniel had sold his booty and bought a Volkswagen Beetle-motorcycle contraption. Half the body of a dead Beetle car fused to half the body of a working motorcycle. A kind of taxi, it looked like an engineer 's heroin-fueled fantasy ; he told Garba that the Beetle 's seats gave him room to carry more passengers. Garba saw a small travel bag in the back. # " The police arrested Baby-Cockroach and Don P this morning, " Thank-God-For-Daniel said in a trembling voice. A neighbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before. He too was sure it was Incomplete Injection in the paper. He believed it was Incomplete Injection who had given up Baby-Cockroach and Don P. He was sure he and Garba were next. Garba 's hands began to shake. Thank-God-For-Daniel said he had visited Incomplete Injection 's house. No Incomplete Injection, and his neighbors gave conflicting accounts on when they had last seen him. # " Garba, you used your own bare hands to wake sleeping dogs, " Thank-God-For-Daniel said testily, leaning on his Beetle-motorcycle. " If you had n't told a certified madman to go and stone the police, all of this would not have happened. " " Nobody is above mistake, " said Garba indignantly. # " There is mistake, then there is miss-take, " argued Thank-God-For-Daniel. # A square-jawed Chinese-Lithuanian who always dressed in a tangerine turtleneck waved at Garba as he came out of the brothel. His arm was hooked to the arm of a smiling ten-year-old prostitute who was on the radar of a few crusading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the room of an older prostitute during the day. # " What are we going to do? " Garba asked, nodding curtly at the prostitute. # His friend pulled out a gray-blue turban from the bag in the Beetle and wrapped it tightly around his own head. Garba watched, fascinated. # " I 'm on my way now to the village, " said Thank-God-For-Daniel. " My uncle lives in Abeokuta, and I will go there until everything cools down. My advice to you is run NOW. If the police catch us we will be locked in prison on awaiting trial charges until whatever day the trumpet sounds from heaven. " # Garba watched the Beetle-motorcycle drive down the street toward the main road. He knew that what he had to do, he had to do fast. He had decided on a radical action ; and now he thought about his father with mournful regret. # By evening he had sold the Rolex, and asking the oldest girl to keep an eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the pilot 's incriminating clothes and dumped them in the pit toilet hole. He went out again and bought a dark baseball cap for disguise, from Park ' N ' Pick Supermarket. He pulled the cap over his eyes and bought two bars of Lux, a tube of Pepsodent, one Jordan toothbrush, and colored camphor balls. He bought a pair of big pearl earrings from a woman who hawked jewels pinned to an apron on her chest. It was the type he had seen his mother wear to Igbo Development Union meetings in Malanville. # Back home, he turned off the light, locked the door, and curled on the bed waiting for his girlfriend to return from work so he could tell her his plans, so he could comfort her as she cried in the crook of his arm. In his hand, he twisted the nametag of the Ghanaian pilot, which he had found in a corner of his bag. Had he committed a kind of fraternal sacrilege by robbing an outsider like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the band of his boxers as a pledge of penitence -- worn like the proud blade in the belt of the Dahomey Amazon Seh-Dong-Hong-Beh. # His girlfriend did not return that night. Garba kept a frantic vigil, too afraid to go out and look for her for fear her absence might be staged by the police as a way to lure him into their crab-trap. # In the morning she came back in the company of a broad-nosed man with a small beard and seemed surprised to see him. She apologized to Garba and told him she had passed the night at the home of the friend who was interested in smuggling. # Garba wondered if she was fucking this man, who greeted him in a bull 's bass( avoiding eye contact), then went to stand outside. The man was her coworker. He had seen him once at an Xmas party the Motherless Babies Home hosted. Throughout the party the coworker 's greedy eyes had tracked Garba 's girlfriend 's wide hips. She did not explain why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask. # Garba saw now that she had stayed away because she thought the police would crash through the door at night and grab him, and she did not want to be collateral damage. When he cleared out, he saw what her new life would be. The coworker would replace him. She had probably slept at his place, and he had followed her here, as some sort of leashed King Kong, in case the police were lurking. He would distract the police with his manly voice. He would tell them that this was his girlfriend. She had merely lent Garba some Market-Union money, and the bastard had asked her to come for it today. # Garba felt deeply hurt, and turned away as she stripped to her purple panties. She told him she would buy the foodstuff today. She asked if he had bought the Dulux paint. He said, soon. In an insistent voice he had never heard before, she asked how soon. Today, he replied. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said he had " dropped " sixteen bars at MC Microphone Conductor 's, but now they had creative differences. He was looking to work with maybe a Beninoise producer for the other tracks. He did not tell her he was absconding to Benin. # Garba peeped at the window as she left for work with the grinning coworker who leaned casually to pick something out of her hair. She bowed in acknowledgement. Was he her type? He wondered at what point she had decided they would not last. Their entire relationship had probably stayed on the verge of the past tense. The sexing and kissing had been merely commemorative. # He wondered if he had arrived in her life too late for her to claim him, like the abandoned babies she salvaged around the city. # As he began to fold clothes rapidly into two plastic suitcases on the bed he saw that he was right in deciding to return to his mother, for whom he had bought the pearl earrings. He did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now. # He remembered the smooth angles of her face. Had the years slackened her youth? Would she be waiting to greet him in front of the house, warned by some child-mother radar as she pressed her cheek against his frayed baby photo? He was going to make his twenty songs with the best Benin producer -- Ekambi Brillant, who produced Angelique Kidjo 's first album many years ago, and who he would search for in Porto-Novo, or Cotonou, or South Africa. Until he found him. # He had sold the Rolex for 100,000 naira, and now he counted out 2,000 and placed it on the coffee table for his girlfriend. A lover 's snub. Scarcely a quarter the price of a Dulux. It was left to her to whore-up the 10,000-naira balance for the paint, if she was that crazy about paint. He made that clear in a curt note he tossed beside the money. # When he was all packed, the camphor balls strewn all over the clothes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baseball cap pulled low over the crocodile-scar in his brow, and looked around. Then he heard the wail of a police siren through the window, and froze. # It was n't close, but he wondered if they were coming for him. His fingers trembled as the sound went away. He sighed and sneaked out of the room quickly, half-running on the street, his suitcases thumping against his legs
