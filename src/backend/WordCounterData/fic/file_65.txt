1009941 When Michelle Huneven began writing novels, she was in seminary ostensibly to become a Unitarian minister : " I was studying religion on a daily basis, while all my smart, educated friends outside of school had rejected institutionalized religion and were skeptical even about so-called ' spirituality. ' What would happen, I wondered, if one of them had a crisis that was essentially spiritual in nature and therefore required a spiritual solution? " <p> In Huneven 's first novel, Round Rock( September 1998), spiritual crisis came in the form of alcoholism, and its solution was found in Alcoholics Anonymous(AA) and personal recovery. " But even AA spirituality is somewhat institutionalized, and certainly has its own vocabulary, " Huneven says. " After finishing Round Rock, I grew interested in people who did n't qualify for any such program, who had to forge their own paths, invent their own vocabularies, find their own communities. " For inspiration, she looked to William James, who examined how different temperaments lead to different kinds of religious experiences in his 1910 classicThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's second book, Jamesland, a novel about three people-a chef, a Unitarian minister, and an unemployed biologist-each undergoing a different kind of spiritual emergency. The three form an uneasy, grudging alliance and keep watch over one another 's halting progress. <p> " I also wanted to write about what a spiritual quest might look like at the end of the twentieth century-a spiritual quest by someone who, like so many of my friends, was basically irreligious and resistant to spiritual thought. " Thus was born the story of Alice Black, whose life takes an unexpected turn in the middle of one night. " She 'll spend the rest of the book trying to make sense of what happened that night, " Huneven says. " I 'm not sure she ever does, exactly. But her life is transformed. " <p> Here, then, is the prologue to Jamesland. <p> ALICE BLACK WOKE TO THE SOUND OF SKIDDING furniture. " Nick? " she called, certain he 'd come back. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begged him to stay, and he 'd left angry. Now, as sometimes happened, he 'd returned, more than a little drunk, to apologize-and leave again. " Nick? " she said, louder. " Is that you? " The reply was a muffled thump : man meets armchair. <p> " Hold on, baby. " She swung out of bed. " I 'll get the light. " <p> In the hall, reaching for the dining room switch, she smelled hills-dry, spicy chaparral-along with a wet-dog stink. She stepped back. Normal night noises drifted in : distant traffic, a mockingbird 's complicated song. In the faint, chill glow from some outside light she could make out the rosewood table surrounded by its ladder-back chairs, and the Venetian glass vase holding pale, blowsy roses. Beyond the table rose a furry shoulder, a long neck and large, pricked ears. <p> As the word deer came to mind, Alice noted the shiny black nose, wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antlers. A doe, then. Crescents of light swung in the animal 's moist eyes. <p> Nick must not have shut the front door. <p> Alice stepped quietly into the room and the deer sprang straight up-it was almost comical how her skinny, knobbed knees with their coin-sized worn spots lifted into view. She twisted as if to reverse direction, knocked framed pictures off the wall and slammed a shoulder into the wainscoting. Chairs toppled and sound funneled back into the room. The deer was snorting, a noise part whistle, part shriek. Her hooves, like tiny cleft plastic slippers, lost purchase on the waxed hardwood, and she sprawled out on the floor. Alice 's heart boomed. <p> The doe, panting, slowly began to gather herself, leg by leg. Sticking her rump high in the air, she pushed off from her forelegs, stood, took some tentative, tottery steps before her hooves again shot out from under her and she fell with a sickening thump. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and herd her toward the front door. Then, a human noise, a whimper : Alice 's great-aunt stood in the kitchen doorway. Without her glasses, in a white gown, with her white hair floating sideways in a tuft, she looked tiny, shrunken, ancient. <p> IMG
