5003241 # We emerged at twilight, the last residents of the 500 block of North 127th Street. We sat on cement stoops and leaned against warped screen doors and waited for true night to arrive. My neighbors -- the two old women in the houses opposite mine, the family of four next door with the too-loud TV, Mr. Jenkins at the southern corner -- called out to each other by name. They nodded at me ; I nodded back. # It was summer and night was late in coming. The sky turned purple and litter swirled in the shadows. The stars came out, glittering in the sky like the blacktop glittered in the streetlights, just last evening. I stared at the sky, trying to find constellations learned from grade school text books. It might finally be possible to see them. # Soon my neighbors were just shapes, hovering at the edge of the gauzy spotlights their curtained windows cast. Everything else was invisible ; above us, the streetlights were invisible, but I knew they were there, standing in memorial of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures, before the mayor had determined that the city could n't afford its energy bill, and the only option was to let this old neighborhood go. Like a field left to the weeds and the things that eat them. # Above me, a rash of stars, but no order in them. # I went inside and closed the deadbolt. I took a tour of the switches for the overheads and lamps, throwing blazes through the house. It was 200 years old, three stories high and 16 feet wide. The first floor held a combined living and dining room and a kitchen that opened to a cement patio ; the second floor offered a spare bedroom and only bathroom, as well as an alcove the realtor had staged as an office, an iron tree of tea candles set in the sealed fireplace ; and finally the top floor, Chris and my bedroom, a queen bed and cheap drapes concealing the boarded-up door to the deck. # The realtor had been near apoplectic when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, woken to the sound of the last flowerpots being smashed a few yards away. It had n't been her, stretching two layers of hospital latex gloves over her trembling hands to pick the pieces of a smashed hypodermic needle from the clumps of soil and smashed leaves. # I stood at the bedroom window, staring at my own reflection pasted over the invisible houses, and then I turned off the light and disappeared with them. # In the morning, I found socks balled on the bedroom floor, an orange-tinted glass in the sink. Chris had come and gone. His life had become a grim cycle of hospital overtime, drowsy commutes, brief and desperate sleep and bracing showers. # The 500 block of North 127th Street was laid bare : pitted concrete, wooden planks, glowing bricks, an uneven row of cars parked with one set of wheels on the curb, the only way to allow other cars to pass. # It was supposed to be gentrifying. # " It 's supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # " It 's not, " she said. We had gone to high school together. She had made mistakes, too ; specifically, six years of drinking. I was n't embarrassed to let her watch me dig deeper and deeper into my own mistake. I should have sold years ago, when it truly did seem like the neighborhood was changing for the better, or the more expensive, anyway. # " The last offer was way too low. " # " Look, you 're not losing your money, " she said. " Your mother bought the house. And you and your mother never got along anyway. So you 're not losing anything emotionally. " # " It 's worth more, " I insisted. I could n't stop insisting, to everyone, to myself. When I inherited the house, it seemed like a step toward a slightly better, slightly easier life ; now it was all I had. All I had beside Chris. # " Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is your last chance. Not for any real money -- that 's all over -- but at least to be free. Start over. " She paused. " You know I 'm right. " # " Ok, " I said. There was a tremor in my voice. That 's all over. " Call them back. " # We hung up. " It 's worth something, " I said out loud. # Banging outside. I opened the door and leaned into the soupy morning. Mr. Jenkins was nailing boards to the front windows of the house next door. The glass was gone, but pale blue curtains were still gathered in the corner. # " They did n't tell you? " he asked, and I shook my head. Once, when we first moved in, we had pounded on the shared wall, and they had turned the television up even louder. We had never been on great terms. # Mr. Jenkins was the only who treated me like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took good care of the house : swept the stoop, painted the shutters. It was probably because I was the only other white person. # He said, " They left for Atlanta. Family there. " # Atlanta. Chicago. Las Vegas. Even Baltimore. To me, they all meant the same thing. Places that were alive. Places that were not here. # Good, Chris would say later. Now at least it will be quiet. # It was very quiet, but only for a brief time, and he was never there to enjoy it. # Mr. Jenkins hummed to himself as he worked. He did n't like seeing another family go, but he liked this : being the steward of the neighborhood. If it was a neighborhood anymore. How many people have to live someplace to make it a neighborhood? # " How many people have to live someplace to make it a neighborhood? " I typed into Google. I was on my second glass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Every lamp I owned burned. # The house creaked -- some bone settling or organ pulsing. I put my ear to the wood, long glossy planks chipping at the seams, like a nomad listening for a herd. # All that night, and the next night, and the night after that, the house came to life. I imagined the electricity once contained in the streetlights ' smooth wires and projection diameters, now become loose and itchy. It popped in the walls, prickled between the floorboards, sighed through the roof. # Five nights after the lights went out, the symphony playing through the house assembled itself into a creature picking through the attached vacant. There were footsteps on the other side of the accent wall in our bedroom. # Rhythmic, bipedal patter. A straining beam. A hush. # It was nearly two am -- Chris was at the hospital -- and there was someone in the vacant, testing the floor. # I sat down, clutching the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # The door at the end of the hall was boarded up, and the first floor doors were double-bolted. # The police would n't come. # The next day, I ran into Jenkins outside the dollar store. He was carrying a bucket and a trowel. Painting over the graffiti that had begun spreading like mold. # " I think an animal got into 543, " I told him. # " Rats, " he said. His voice was grim, but the corner of his mouth flickered a smile. " I 'll bring over poison. " # " Oh, poison, " I repeated breathlessly. I had a hysterical hatred of rats, but an equally powerful aversion to killing them. " But they 'll die in the house, " I recovered. " I 'll be able to smell them. Is n't there something else? " # He set the bucket down. It was filled with cloudy water, a gray cloth slung over its edge. # " Poison 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe it 's not rats, " I said. " No, it was bigger. " Big enough to mistake for a person. " Like maybe a raccoon. " # " Raccoons, out here? " He reconsidered. " These days, maybe. Raccoons are bad. Rabies. " # " Oh, rabies, " I repeated. " Maybe I should call animal control. " The police stayed scarce, but I had seen the animal control van driving by several times recently. # He looked skeptical. " You could. " # " I 'll call them. " His eagerness to go hunting unnerved me. " Thanks, though. " # I recognized the look on his face. The You 're Making a Mistake face. I had seen it on my realtor. On Chris. I had grown up with it, too, now that I think about it. # " Let me know, " he said. # Let me know when you realize you were wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't grow up in the house. My mother bought it after I moved out of the two-bedroom apartment where she had raised me. They were increasing the rent, and she had savings by then -- the house on North izyth St. was an investment. It was always a council-session away from being declared a historic district. Plus, she had grown up in a house ; she felt like everyone should have a house. She died and now I did. # I liked the neighborhood, at first. I joked I was a pioneer, staking out a place in the slowly changing neighborhood. There was an independent pharmacy, in business for four decades ; the Spanish restaurant, seafood in yellow sauce served on plastic plates ; a closet-sized espresso bar, where I sometimes worked before it shut down. I had spent the last two years laying out guides for a European tour company based in Ohio. As long as I had electricity and an occasional Internet connection, I could download stock images and format @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. # I liked the house. It was small house, built for the short and slender people of the 18th century, but it was bigger than the apartments I 'd lived in, and once Chris moved in, it felt like the perfect amount of space. My mother had knocked down the kitchen wall, opening up the space, and replaced it with a Formica counter finished to look more expensive than it was. The kitchen let out onto a concrete patio, where we kept a bistro table for two and a flower pot garden. I turned the second floor into a library : kitschy book cases, a slim desk for my work computer. I imagined transforming it into a yoga studio( when I learned how to do yoga), an art studio( when I learned to make art), a nursery( when). # We grew basil on the roof desk. We had held a few dinner parties, even, back when public transportation still circulated all hours, keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But soon there was the scrabbling in the walls, $200 for a pest control company that never found the source of the noise. We could n't afford to fix the crumbling fireplace, and were forced to seal it. There was the incident on the roof deck. I added bars on the windows, too -- realizing that I was one of the last residents to do so. # I began constructing increasingly complex routes to remain on the safe blocks. Dollar stores and fast food franchises ate the commercial corridor, and then succumbed to the blight of empty storefronts. Chris 's hours increased, and I spent more and more time alone. # A week after the streetlights went off, a red-and-white brochure appeared under my door -- a Chinese menu with fried chicken wings and plantains, a place that had closed weeks ago. I turned it over and found blocky magic market letters scrawled on the back. # " I did n't mean to scare you. Please accept my apologies. I wish only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your neighbor. Julien. " # I immediately went outside and knocked on 543 's door, and then on the plywood that Jenkins had installed over the front window. It was already graffitied with illegible red streaks. I stepped back and examined the front of the house. It looked no different than it did the day before. I went through my kitchen to the patio and peered through the chain links that separated our lots. The entrance and windows were sealed, but the planks 011 the top window were skewed. He must have pulled down some of the wood. # And then replaced it, closing himself inside. # Chris was working overnight again. New memos on budget cuts circulated each week, and the nurses were threatening an illegal strike. Chris began to feel like each and every patient teetered on death 's blade, and they needed him, bim. " I 'm having exhaustion-fueled visions of grandeur, " he told me over the phone. Visions, not delusions. The residents were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Creaking next door. Chris detailed his night, the series traumas he attended, while I followed Julien 's footsteps across the bedroom and halfway down the stairs. Julien knocked on the wall and I dropped the phone. # " Hello? Are you there? " Chris 's voice was barely audible, a metal wire vibrating by my feet. # I knocked back. # At my door, a taqueria menu : # " I 'll be at the front window to deliver counsel at n am today. I will accept my lunch then. Blessings upon you. Your neighbor. Julien. " # I surveyed the contents of my cabinets and refrigerator, and settled on peanut butter on whole wheat, some sliced cheddar and an apple, soft but not yet brown. A child 's lunch, virtuous, not overly solicitous on my part. Vegetarian, in case he did n't eat meat. As I sliced, a knocking sounded in the distance, then a sawing and a pounding. # I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two older women, who had lived on this block for ages, pressed their faces against the bars of their living room windows, hands dangling between the iron like cellmates. They spent many afternoons like that, conversing in differently accented English. Now they watched in silence as Julien punched a rude slot through the board Jenkins had posted not a week ago. # " Who 's in there? " one of them called, and I did n't know if she was speaking to Julien or me, standing on the stoop with a loaded paper plate. # " Someone making a mess of this street, " the other woman replied. # " Used to have respect for the neighborhood, " the first said. # " He 's here to offer counsel, " I said. Their faces turned to me slowly, but they said nothing. I skipped off my top step and faced 543. Four fingers, rusty with dirt, hung out of the opening, which was perhaps twice the height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch, " I said. The hand flipped palm side up, and then pulled the plate into the eternal night of the vacant rowhouse. # Now the corner of a mouth slid into the frame. " Thank you for this gift, " Julien said. His voice was quiet and rough, and though I had imagined a wiry ascetic, now I thought of those lipless white men whose bulk is half muscle and half fat, tacky tattoos and belts under their bellies. # I should have been put off by the condescension. I should have found it phony. Just as I should have rolled my eyes and ignored the presumptuous lunch order. But I liked him. I liked him for asking something of me. For knocking and waiting for me to knock back. # " You 're welcome, " I said, and waited by the empty window for a few moments, the women 's eyes on my back, before going back home and locking the door behind me. # Chris did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labeled " seafood " -- chunks of white meat streaked with orange, tentacle clusters the size of my thumbnail -- in coconut milk, some sprouting garlic, and a handful of wilted parsley. I ate a few spoon-fulls and put the rest in plastic. In the morning, I found a tangled blanket on the floor beside the couch. Chris had come home, but had n't even come upstairs. # There was no message under my door, but I made Julien lunch anyway, leftover stew and some lettuce dressed with the last of Chris 's expensive balsamic vinegar. # I stepped outside and saw a young man with a baseball cap standing by the window, and those same fingers fluttering in their dark window. They were speaking in low tones. I closed myself back behind the screen door. After a few minutes, the young man turned away from the window and began strolling down the middle of the street, his hands in his pockets. He nodded at me, and I drew back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightened too. I grew up keeping my eyes up, down, darting to the side -- the quick improvisation of no eye contact. And then I heard him through the glass. # " Have a good one. " # I looked up again, but he had already passed. # Julien 's fingers rested lightly on the unfinished wood, like a pianist 's on the keys. I imagined plaster and brick strung with tuned wire, and my house the chamber where the chords echoed into life. # I handed him his lunch. " Thank you, " he said. The vowels were lax, the consonants defined. He did n't have the local accent. # " Are you a priest? " I asked. " Am I supposed to call you ' father '? " # " No, " he said. " I have no training and no boss but the Lord. " # I waited for him to say more, but he was quiet. 1 did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, or to speak further -- to petition or to confess. # " What did that guy want? " I asked. # " Confidential, " Julien answered. " But I can tell you what I told him. " # " What 's that? " # " All will be well. " # " Could you be more specific? " # There was a moment of silence. " No, I think that covers everything. " # " Oh, but, do you mean all will be well like our material problems will go away, or all will be well like none of this really matters anyway? " # " All will be well, " he said again. His voice was neither impatient nor indulgent ; he was just speaking the truth, and with kindness, waiting for me to understand. # And so it went. Each day, I watched between the small gap in my curtains as the line of people waiting to speak to him grew longer. An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 127th St. I prepared paper plate after paper plate of lunches. I came to know Julien 's preferences -- he ate meat, but not cheese. Beets, but not carrots. He found rice particularly satisfying. These are the things I came to keep in the house. I came to eat them too. # " So he does n't just expect you to bring him food, he tells you what to make, " Chris spoke through the phone. # " No, " I answered, because truly, I could n't remember him asking for anything in particular, or even complaining. He always said the same thing. " Thank you for this gift, " and I was pretty sure it was n't even a thank you to me, but some kind of prayer. I still had n't seen his face. " He just likes certain things better. " # " One time on the way home I gave half a ham sandwich to this homeless guy who 's always on Collins, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gluten. " # I changed the subject. " Where are you? " # " I 'm laying on a gurney. " # " No, you 're not. " # He laughed. " Yeah. My back 's killing me. Too many nights on couches. " # " Get up! Are you tempting fate, or something? " # He laughed again, because I was n't superstitious, and must have been joking. # I changed the subject again. " What direction are you facing? " # " Facing? Up. For now. My head is pointing, let 's see, I think it 's north. " # Toward me. # " No, northeast. East. I think east. " # East. That 's a holy direction, I thought, for some reason, a reason I could n't pinpoint so I said nothing, and our conversation fell away into silence. # When the streetlights first turned off, I flipped every switch in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draped my lamps with scarves and carried a flashlight, paranoid about drawing attention to myself, blazing windows in a mostly blackened quarter. I wished I could rise with the sun and sleep when it set, like pre-industrial ancestors must have, but my rhythms would n't reset. # My back ached and I blamed the io-year-old mattress, a bog pulling me down. I had brought it from our old apartment, and it no longer seemed like something I should lean my body against. Instead, I lay flat on the hard floor, and when I woke into blackness I tapped the wall I shared with Julien, and he tapped back, a soft thump that seemed to stir the moonlight like a puff of unsettled dust. You could imagine things like that, when the beams your existence was built on had fallen away. Energy falling and rising in particles. Hands that could play in the same currents as heaven. # " I 'm afraid to ask : How bad is it out there? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. # " I ca n't tell if it 's quieter at night, or if it 's just because my TV is off. " # " Wait, they have n't cut off your electricity, have they? " she asked, alarmed. # " No, of course not, no. God, it 's not like that. " # " What happened to your TV? " # " Did you hear back from them yet? " # " I have a lead. It 's a group. " # " A group of what? An organization? Preservation people? You know it was n't that long ago they were talking about naming this a historic district. " I did n't need a lone buyer -- the neighborhood needed a benevolent sponsor, the academics and activists, the charitable rich. I imagined the 500 block of north 127th Street refinished, the litter cleared away, the sidewalks repaved, the brick power-washed, brand new shutters crafted according to historical specs. # " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And corporate backers. " # " Great! " # " Do n't get too excited. This is all very preliminary. I 'm waiting for a call back. " # The crowds continued to grow. Julien only came to his window from noon until two, and he never rushed his appointments, so visitors began arriving early, and then staying late, holding their spots overnight. I heard them all night, low voices sometimes rising into laughter, and I laughed with them, imagining their jokes. It was like that first night, when the streetlights went dark, when all of us were neighbors, sitting peaceably together while the world went dim. # Chris did n't come home. # Yes, of course, I had a lot of questions. How old was he? Was anyone looking for him? Did he grow up in the city, or on the coast? Did he move around a lot, like a military brat? Was he a once promising law student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twin sister posting photos of his face downtown? Was his hair brown? Was he average height, average build, did he have one of those faces, did he look familiar even to strangers? Did he have a nice singing voice? Had he read The Great Gatsby or Catcher in the Rye? Did he like them? Did he used to drink, like the realtor? Did he have a fear of commitment and delusions of grandeur, like Chris? # Well, of course Julien had delusions of grandeur. He thought he knew more than me, more than all of us. He thought I owed him lunch every day. # Every day I brought him lunch, and I did n't ask him anything about himself. # Instead I asked, " How did you find this place, anyway? " # " It came to me in a dream, " he said, and waved his palm slowly across the darkness. " Just kidding. Craigslist. Just kidding. I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said. " Forces beyond your control. " # I asked, " Are the people here nice to you? " # " Are they nice to you? " # " I do n't know. " # " Are you nice to them? " His fingers brushed across the surface of the wood, back and forth, back and forth. His fingernails were blunt but straight, and bordered in black. # " I do n't know. " I paused. " I 'm nice to you. " # I asked, " Does God speak to you? " # He circled his thumb and index finger against each other. His nails were clean ; I had brought him a file and a brush, a bar of soap, which he declined. Too many chemicals. " Yes, but that does n't matter to you. " # " Sure it does, if God 's speaking next door. " # " Does God speak to you? " Julien asked, a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters. That 's what matters to you. " # I began rearranging the furniture. I found spackle and ancient tubs of Benjamin Moore in the downstairs closet, and repaired the doorframe to my office. I took down all my books and slid the bookcase away from the living room to fill the holes my mother 's shelves had left behind. I had cleaned out all the closets and drawers when I first hired the realtor, but still, I owned so many things. So many things. The liquor store gave me boxes -- as if I were moving -- and I began packing up all of the extras I never used, unused towels and old dishes, DVDs watched once and books half-read, a mess of cables and specialty batteries that some device might someday need. # I carried the boxes to the third floor, my bedroom with the boarded-up deck, and moved my clothes to the second-floor guest-room. I bought anemic bouquets from the bodega and scrubbed wooden floors with vinegar. I scrubbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the stove. And I sat down to enjoy the last of the afternoon. # Something was going on on the 500 block of North izyth Street. Families were camping on the broken blacktop. Old women were sitting in lawn chairs, rosaries in one hand, battery-operated fans in one hand, trained on their necks, chins pointed to the sky. The two women across the street began operating competing businesses out of their barred windows, one trading plates of noodles and cabbage, the other trading tortillas piled with burnt meat and cilantro, for wrinkled dollar bills. I stood in line too, but when I threaded my money through the bars, the woman turned away, waving her hands. " My food 's not good enough for you. " # I stood there, surrounded on all sides, by customers, embarrassed, until one stranger, a young woman with curly hair piled on her head, said, " It 's cause he only takes from you. " When I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand. " The father. " # " He 's not a priest, " I said. I realized the others in line were listening to me. They thought I knew him -- of course, everyone knew I brought him his lunch. Each day they parted for me and my paper plates. " He has no boss. " # " No boss but God, " someone said. I nodded, and the others nodded, and I returned to my house. # Julien 's hands, extending from the soft blackness, reminded me of the story of St. Kevin, who had gone to live in the wilderness of Ireland. One day a swallow landed on his shoulder. St. Kevin stood perfectly still while the bird built a nest, brooded over its eggs, hatched its young, fed them and urged them into flight. Julien 's hands were as graceful as the bird, as gentle as St. Kevin, his brown-edged fingernails like river-smooth stones, his creased skin like the weave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we stood on opposite sides of the wall. I followed him up and down the stairs. He knocked and I knocked back. He did n't like to stay in the front room where he kept his window. He did n't feel safe there, I thought. Instead he came up to the third floor, across from my bedroom, and settled on the floor. I did n't know if he had pillows, or blankets, or just lamp-less night seeping through the cracks in the foundations -- a dark that turns you so blind you could see again with your mind only. I could see that way too now. # The darkness that closes around you like a hand. # Julien 's left hand, mostly, but sometimes his right hand, reaching out into the summer noon, hesitant sometimes, like a blinking eye, tapping the plywood while the visitors whispered their troubles into the house 's eternal night. # Chris left me a message. " Janet said we can have her place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day. Just lock the house and leave. Go out the back if you 're worried. Just call me and tell me when you 're on your way. And what did the realtor say? " # I 'm not religious. I do n't know where I heard the story of St. Kevin, or why I remember it. # The realtor returned with an offer from the group. It was an online sales conglomerate. They wanted to knock down the houses on this block, and the five blocks around it, to build a warehouse and shipping center with proximity to the airport and the river. The mayor had agreed to sell the vacants for a dollar each, and would propose a tax abatement with stipulations specific to the corporation to lure them within the city limits. The development would prevent an urban center from going completely feral. It was up to us, the few owners left, to save the neighborhood, save it by selling it. # It was a good offer. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our improvement costs. # " Our prayers, " the realtor laughed, " are answered. " # There was a knock at my door. It was a young woman with curly hair, the same who had talked to me when the woman across the street refused to serve me. She had no make-up, tiny silver hoops in her ears, and perfectly geometric eyebrows. # Suddenly I wanted to ask her, Where do you live? The next block? Ten blocks? Is your street mostly abandoned too? How many people do you think are here? 50? 100? Are the police going to notice? The press? What is going to happen next? # I should n't discuss the offer, the realtor had warned me. It was a dicey PR situation, and if news leaked before everyone was on board, it could all fall apart. # I was n't afraid to go out my front door. I was n't afraid of the people I lived beside. It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and he never hid it well. # She leaned against my doorframe, her arms crossed over her chest, and squinted out into the crowd. # " Who 's that guy? " she asked quietly. # She was staring into the middle distance, where the queue snaked for Julien. His hand flickered like a moth 's wing and then disappeared as a beefy guy in a sweat-soaked t-shirt leaned his shoulder into the plywood. # But I knew who she was talking about. Across the street and six houses down, where the knot of visitors loosened, stood Jenkins, his hands in his pockets, his back against a wood-sealed doorway -- he had sealed it himself, months before. He was wearing a baseball cap low over his eyes, and the visor sliced through the thick midday air and stopped when it came to point to me. He nodded. I nodded back. # The group had offered to buy his house too. # " He lives there. " # " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julien was n't trained, " I said. " He does n't have a boss. " And then, " No, " I agreed. " He does n't like him. " # " So. " Her hand shot out, and she smacked my elbow with her knuckles. " What are you going to do? " # What was I going to do. What was I going to do. What was I going to do. # " You should tell him, " she said. " Tell Julien. " # But I did n't tell him. I followed him up the stairs, through the second and third floors, knocking the wall, the top bedroom-turned storage space. Entering the third story felt like entering an unused part of myself, and I admitted then that I had intentionally bricked up my own mind, all the inconvenient hopes, all the disruptive disappointments, all those murderous truths. I confessed it all, right then, in my heart -- I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew. # The room was full of boxes now, and by the sealed terrace door, a plastic cup filled with nails long as my fingers, and a hammer. I think Jenkins ' had leant it to me ; I forgot to give it back. # I picked up the hammer, and tapped it softly in my left palm. I let my hand curl into a cup and I cradled that metal plug, cold and hard-edged and mean and I warmed it until it was more bone than iron. # And then I swung it as hard as I could against the wall, the wall between me and Julien, and I swung again and again. The plaster crumpled and the air filled with dust, and I remembered the mice and birds that could be hiding there, the roaches, certainly, and I swung again, even harder, and I hit the soft wooden bones of the house, and I smelled the air shut up in that old vacant and then I heard Julien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? " he asked. We stood farther apart than we did at the window downstairs, but we were alone and the wall was broken, and for a moment I was afraid he would come toward me. # " Why did you pick this house? " I asked. # " God picked it, " he said. # " I 've come for counsel, " I said. " I got an offer on the house. Should I sell? " # He was quiet for a moment. " Is it a good offer? " # " What do you mean? " # " Is it enough money? " # I had n't expected him to say that. # " Also you just knocked a hole in the wall, " he added. " If that matters. " # That bothered me. " It 's my house, " I said. " I 'll knock a hole in the wall if I want to. If I want to talk to my neighbor. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to me, " he said. " You made this hole so I could talk to you. " # " So talk, " I said. # This is the oldest part of the oldest city, Julien said. Cities swell where the wells are deep and the spirit is strong, and buildings grow where the spirit is strongest, and roads grow along the earthlines, and no mayor can sell, no electric company can turn off what was there before them and what will be, what you may think is sleeping, but which is not, for it is always moving, it is always thinking, it is always planning, it knows, it knows. # The world is big, it 's unknown, but we have choices, still, every choice ; our joys can be simple and our despair is fleeting ; the world is far older than we imagine, but we make it new ; we do n't know, we do n't have to know, we ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, sometime ; we imagine the world into being and it is real ; we all want to be reassured and Julien is here to reassure us, yes, I am reassuring you, there is someone who knows, there is someone who knows too that all will be well. # Someone was knocking on my door, banging on it, battering it. I looked through the peephole. It was the same woman with the curly hair and sharp eyebrows. I wondered if they had elected her, or if she claimed to know me, or if she had n't thought at all, just come to me, when Jenkins appeared, flanked by a couple men I recognized -- a son-in-law and a nephew. I watched through my curtains. They stood with their backs to Julien 's window argued with some other men. That restrained dance of aggression : shoulders up, weight shifting foot to foot, slowly shrinking the space between them. The woman 's fist on my door spelled out what are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. # I had never invited Jenkins over for a meal. I had never leant anyone a cup of sugar, or taken in their mail when they traveled -- but then again, no one had ever asked me. Now I made coffee, and arranged homemade cookies on a plate. I told him about what I had learned from the manual the realtor had given me way back when, and the old photographs at the public library, and the building records at the historical society. #( I did n't say that the circuitous bus ride had taken an hour and a half, or how disgusting the city center now seemed, uncluttered with trash but crammed with humanity. Roaring cars and steaming sidewalk vents. The tension made my back ache return, and it did n't melt away until 15 minutes into my long walk home from the last bus stop, when I saw a wall tagged with All Will Be Well, All Will Be Will, All Will Be Well.) # I told Jenkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house. She extended the kitchen addition, creating the roof deck. She built a banquette with repurposed particle board bedframe and curtains from a catalogue. She restored the moldings, refinished the floors, reglazed the child-sized bathtub. And then she died, right here, a heart attack, and I 'm sure no one was more surprised than she was, hovering over her own body, to suddenly be blown away like a newsprint sheet on a breeze of car exhaust. # There 's more to be done. " There 's a wall upstairs that someone should look at, " I added lightly. # " Excuse me, " Jenkins said. He had n't eaten any cookies and his coffee cup was still full. " But all of that work does n't mean very much if there 's a crazy person squatting next door, and a street full of even crazier people. " # " But you love this neighborhood. " # " Yeah, " he agreed, and looked down. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " He paused. " It 's time for all this to end. " # That afternoon, storm clouds amassed overhead, and the crowds outside milled with their faces turned up, occasionally tilting their palms toward the sky, weighing the air pressure, panning for raindrops. Just as evening fell, the lightning began. I listened to the scrape of coolers and folding chairs, farewells in some languages I could identify and others I could not. Then lightning struck, and the night was lit for the first time in a month, a negative image, a strobe freeze frame, the blacktop gray and the brick buzzing, and legs spread to stride, hands covering heads. Then the thunder followed and then the rain, and the street emptied of people. # I could n't see the storm but I could hear it. I imagined I was in a boat, a submarine, maybe, breaching the surface in the middle of the world, where the sky was as black as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tiny teeth. Thunder beat again and again, echoing down through the rowhomes, all bracing against each other like people once did here, like their ghosts risen and materialized for a magic midnight, the people who had built this neighborhood to shore up themselves because no one else would, and in these bones once abandoned now animated, I heard the thunder like it was next door, like Julien was a small piece of the storm itself. # " I hate this house, " I had told Julien. " But I ca n't leave it. I want to destroy it. I want to remake it into another house. New material, new floorplan. I want to turn it around so the back door is the front door. I want to dig a basement. I want to build a balcony that looks over the street. I want to plant a tree in the living room. I do n't want it to be a house at all. " # " So let them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No, " I replied. " Someone should live here. " # " We will, " he said. " One way or another. " # When the storm ended, I went outside. The rain had left the night cool, and my skin prickled in the lingering wind. I stood outside in the barely discernible shadows, even though I was afraid, and I realized it was the first time I had gone outside at night since they turned the lights off. It was also the first time I had come to Julien 's window for counsel. I could see it through the dark, the rough and spotty wood, shifting around clouds of blackness my eyes could n't assemble, and I lifted my hand to the tiny rectangular slot, where Julien 's hand moved, but there was nothing there -- the plank had been torn down. The darkness was n't my night-blindness -- it was the inside of the house, Julien 's house. # Now I could see an overturned bucket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I planted one foot hard on the plastic and gripped the splintered edge, the same wood Jenkins had used to board up my back door, and board up this. He was, I feared, the one who had torn it down, disguised by the noise of the storm. # I heaved myself inside, and held my breath as I crossed into the darkness. My feet hit a rug, soft, like moss in mud. # " Julien, " I said, and then thought maybe I should n't, maybe Jenkins is still here, with the nephew and son-in-law, and I 'm making myself a witness. # But Jenkins would n't hurt me. And he would n't suspect me either. Because I was like him. I was still here, my very presence making this neighborhood still his neighborhood, not Julien 's neighborhood, not the neighborhood of the people who visited him. I was the kind of person who listened carefully to corporate real estate proposals, not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! " I cried out. # I walked through the living room, and veered left, toward the staircase. Our houses were mirror images. # " Julien! " I cried out. # " You 're on the wrong side, " he yelled back, and his voice was frightened, and wet, and I ran up the stairs. His voice shook but still he yelled : " I have one side, you have the other, the visitors have a side, but that 's the other window, it 's the wrong window. " # On the third floor the darkness lessened -- there was the gap in the boarded up window, the one he had exploited to enter. I realized that the night was n't totally black after all, or maybe I had finally become accustomed to it, because I could see. I could see the wall I destroyed, a frozen implosion, and I could see a body curled beneath the window. # Julien 's hands were over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know what to do. I had heard a million stories about emergency room gore, Chris and his friends and their black humor, but I knew nothing about the human body, nothing that mattered. # I struggled to pull my phone from my back pocket, my fingers slipping against it, because they were wet too, and trembling. # " Chris, " I said, and like an answered prayer, he answered. " Chris. " # " I ca n't talk now, " he said. " What 's wrong? " He sounded so distant, like he was on a spaceship. # " My neighbor is hurt. " Julien was rocking slightly, and moaning. I touched his wrists, pried gently, but he would n't move his hands to show me what they 'd done. " I do n't know what to do. " # " Call 911. " # " They wo n't come here! " I shouted. " It 'll take hours! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? " # " Which neighbor? " he asks. " Are you ok? " # " You need to come home! " I say. " I need you to come home! " # But I knew that when I said home he thought of his old apartment, or his parents ' house two hours down the coast. I knew he was never coming back here. # So I hung up. It was all up to me, to figure out what to do. " It 's going to be ok, " I said. " This is the oldest part of the oldest city, and houses grow where the spirit is strongest. " And Julien took his hands away from his face
