4166741 # I looked across at me, sitting on my old, beat-up, green vinyl couch in my cramped little apartment that smelled of too much beer and not enough fresh air. I sat there ; or rather someone who claimed to be me sat there. He was older, and his curly, black hair was silver at the temples. He wore much nicer jeans and a shirt that I could never afford, a burgundy button-down that looked very professional. My own faded jeans and sloppy, blue sweatshirt were good enough, but they looked shabby by comparison. They emphasized the differences between me and this other person with the ridiculous story. Anyone who knew me might say, " Hey, Art, is that your dad? " But they would never mistake him for me. # Still, for all those minor differences, he had more than half convinced me. I 'm no fingerprint expert, but our prints looked identical. He was exactly my height, though bonier, with a sunken lice. And he had told me things about myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. His story was ridiculous, but I could n't prove it wrong, and I had tried. I wanted to prove it wrong, not just because it was such an obvious fraud, but because he looked like such a wreck. He looked defeated, like a guy working on his last chance. I did n't want to believe that could happen to me. I had too much going for me. # He sat there just like I often did, legs crossed, forearms resting on my knees as I leaned in to emphasize a point. If he was an impostor, he was a damned good one, with my mannerisms down pat. I always leaned in more and grew more emphatic when I had a few in me ; and right now, I certainly did. Both future me( as he claimed) and present me had decided that this occasion called for beer. And lots of it. # Future me-I 'll stick to " he " to cut down on the confusion-took another big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can with the gold letters. " I ca n't believe I drank so much of this swill. " # " Hey! " I leaned forward, forearms on my desk, and then realized I was aping his actions. I leaned back and continued. " Stroh s is n't swill! It 's what Dad always drank. " I took a drink, the cold, sweet, grainy taste rushing through my mouth. # He smiled. " You can lie to yourself, maybe, but you ca n't lie to me. It 's not the same beer it was when Dad drank it. Even he wo n't touch it now. You 're not drinking it for nostalgia, you 're drinking it because it 's a cheap way to get drunk. " # " So? " 1 was a bit pissed, because I resented him for knowing what I was really thinking. The beer was okay, but when somebody else was paying, I always ordered more expensive stuff. When it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I never told anyone that, so how could he know? I stared at him, but it was like a staring contest with a smudged mirror. " If you 're who you say you are, you ca n't criticize. You know I like to party, but I do n't let it interfere with my work. Do n't you get drunk anymore, unwind a bit? Those fancy jeans, that sweater, those expensive boots... Are you too good for all this? You 've changed, man. " # He slammed the can down on the end table, but it ended up on a pile of magazines. Then it tipped over, spilling the last bit on the floor. " Oh, geez, gim me a napkin! " Then he looked around at my two-room place and all the clutter. " Oh, yeah, no napkins. Paper towels are good enough. " He got up, walked straight to the closet where I kept paper towels, and pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the spilled beer, tossing the used towels on top of the overflowing trash can without looking. Then he looked back at me. " You 're right, I 've changed. And it all starts here ; but the change will come too late, only after you 're forced into it, and it wo n't do you any good. I have to fix that. " # His story was ridiculous, but he really did look like me plus twenty years, and he knew things about me that nobody else could know. So my choices were that he really was me, and he had invented time travel ; or he was an elaborate hallucination ; or Mom might say he was a demon come to lure me into a pact with Satan. # But I was a confirmed rationalist, so that ruled out the demon/Satan hypothesis. Occam 's razor said that future me was a hallucination, but I had n't drunk that much Stroh s. And besides, he had shown me some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It took a few shortcuts I had never seen befare, and it involved some physics that was on the hairy edge of string theory today. I could n't fallow it all, but I could see that it was consistent. And Occam or no, I could n't conceive of a hallucination that included new, consistent, physicalmathematical discoveries. # So I took as my working hypothesis that he really was me from twenty years in my future ; and if so, I needed to learn more. " Fix what? What changes here? " # He took another can from the case, and he opened it. He might call it swill, but he downed nearly half the can. Then he looked at me, and he said one word : " Gwen. " # " Gwen? " I laughed. Then I saw the pain in his eyes, and I fought to control myself. " It 's no big deal. " I spread my hands wide. " We just had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # He shook his head, and I swear I saw tears in his eyes. Seriously, tears! What, I become a wuss in the future? But before I could think about that, he answered. " No, she wo n't. " He took another drink. " That was n't a little fight, it was the fight. And when she comes back tonight, and she wants to work on things and make things right, you 're going to blow it. You wo n't take it seriously, you wo n't take her seriously. And so she 'll leave, this time for good. " He swallowed. " And you 'll spend the next twenty years trying to find a way to undo the mistake you 're going to make this night. " # He was so damned believable! And his math was persuasive. But Gwen and I had had worse fights before. Besides, the idea that I would invent time travel to get her back? Talk about doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " So tell me again : I invent time travel- " # " No, I invented time travel. " # " Okay, I will invent a time machine twenty years from now so that I can come back twenty years into the present- " # " Go back twenty years into the past. " # " I see twenty years has n't made me any less pedantic. " We both smiled at that, identically and simultaneously. " I will go back into the past to tell myself that this is the night I will screw everything up with Gwen. " # " Uh-huh. And I need to stop you from doing it, so our next twenty years are n't miserable. " # " How miserable could they be? " I looked at the notes he had spread out on my desk. " I- You- We invented time travel! That had to feel great, right? " # He shook his head. " It feels like running away, like hiding from the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but never really getting close to anyone again. No one compared to Gwen. And you have hindsight-well, foresight that I did n't have. I did n't know I was going to invent time travel. I just... stumbled upon it as a consequence of some equations, and I dared to believe it was n't a calculation error. Up until that point, I lived through twenty years of misery. " # " Seriously? Twenty years? " # He looked back at me. " Seriously? People still say ' seriously ' to everything? " Again we showed matching smiles. I was lifting him out of that black mood, at least a bit ; but then his frown returned. " Yes, I 'm serious, damn it! Why do you think I put forth so much effort to punch through to this time? " # I nodded. " So Gwen I mean, we have n't been going out that long. She 's cute, we have fun, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that drove you for two decades? " # He nodded back. " In time the loss wo n't be that bad, no worse than a dull ache in your chest now and then. But for the next few years, after you realize what you 've lost... It will ruin your studies, get you kicked out of two schools. By the time you finally settle into your third, she 'll be married. When you find out, you 'll get drunk, wrap the Dodge around a tree, and spend a semester in rehab. You 'll screw up your CV so bad, you 'll never be taken seriously as a physicist or as a mathematician. Lesser minds will get the laurels. One of your students will even share a Nobel Prize, when you know you 're smarter than him. But not smart enough to overcome your past mistakes. And not smart enough to realize that the best time of your life was last month, that weekend you spent with Gwen at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ; and tonight you 'll slide right off a cliff. You 'll ruin your last chance at happiness ; and the damage to your career will set you back years in understanding temporal mathematics. When you finally dig into it, it will just be a way to hide from the ugly fact that you 're old and alone. " # I shook my head. I wanted him to be wrong. " Yeah, this temporal math, I just do n't believe it. I mean, I know, you 're here, you 're an existence proof. But damn it! You could still be the most elaborate hallucination ever recorded. Or a really cruel hoax by my friends ' in the department. If you want me to-to change my life on your say-so, I 'm going to need extraordinary proof. " # He shrugged. " I do n't know what else I can do to prove I 'm you. I 've told you the color of your imaginary elephant, the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your virginity. I told you about the night you almost drowned in the tub after too many beers. " # " A hallucination would know all of that. " # " Then how can I prove it to you? " # I pointed at the papers. " With proofs. Show me the math. Show me your time mechanism and how it turns that math into travel. Make me understand how this is possible. " # He shook his head. " Impossible. Think of something else. " # " Uh-uh. If you 're me, you know I 'm a skeptic. I take nothing on faith, I need to test it and understand it. So teach me to understand this, and I 'll believe you. " # Again he shook his head. " You do n't have the foundations. You have n't formulated them yet. " # " Ah, bullshit! I 'm twenty-seven years old. My brain is in the prime age for advanced math. If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it now. Especially if I have a brilliant teacher. " # He rubbed his chin. " I always was one hell of a teacher-not that the schools appreciated that. " # " Damn right you are! And you have a fantastic student, and you know how I think. We can do this... if your story is real. Teach me enough so I can believe you, and then I 'll believe what you said about Gwen and me. " # So he taught me. We went over his notes and diagrams. We went through tensor calculations of an order more complex than I had ever seen before. We went through new techniques for simplifying equations by adding dimensions, where the extra dimensions turned discontinuous functions into smooth curves. When he was talking math, he really lifted out of the depression that dragged him down the rest of the time. That was certainly like me : when I was solving a problem or exploring a system, the rest of the world just did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! I had to be the best. # And then he showed me his time mechanism : something like a notebook computer, but he kept opening it... and opening it... and over and over, like he was pulling panels and screens out of some higher dimension. Maybe he was. That machine by itself was pretty convincing. # In the end, I believed him. I could n't manufacture the device, I could n't even explain how it worked ; but I could explain from one step to the next how the equations transformed, logically and inevitably. And I could n't quite prove his insight that showed how those equations led around the corner and through the time dimension, but I could see the evidence that they did just that. # I was convinced without a doubt. He had made time travel believable ; and a hallucination that clear, that lucid, that detailed was simply &laquo; &raquo; believable. When I get drunk, the equations fall apart, they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe : Future me really was me. # Me, but different. I could see the hair, grayer than Dad 's even though he was younger. I could see the lines on his lace : frown lines, even scowl lines. He was a complete wreck. Over Gwen? # He looked back at me, and I lowered my eyes. I did n't want him to see me studying him. He pointed a finger down at the papers. " So are you convinced? " # " Uh-huh. This is... brilliant. This really happened. You did it! " # " Yes, it really will happen. You will do it. It 's just the two of us here, so there 's no need to be modest : we are brilliant. But we were n't smart enough to hang on to Gwen. So do we have a deal? " # It took me a moment to drag my brain out of the multidimensional spaces so I could remember our bargain. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his face. " Finally. All these years, wondering how I could correct tonight. And finally I 've found a way. You can fix this. For both of us. And for Gwen. " # I looked at the notes again. " And you really can only punch through to this timeframe once? " # " Only once. " He pulled out a sheet, set it on top, and pointed at the final equation. " There 's a chronological exclusion principle involving the timelines of my component atoms. If I try to bring the atoms of my body back here again, or anywhere within a decade either way, their nuclei and their electrons will arrive at slightly different times. I would arrive with no electrons at all. " # " You would be ripped apart! " # " Literally. But in here- " He clutched his fist to his chest. " -I was ripped apart a long time ago. Now you have to put us back together. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beer. We had stopped drinking three hours ago, and I had flushed the beer down the john more than an hour ago. " All right, you want Gwen back, I 'll make it happen. We 're not going to fight tonight. I 'm going to change our future. " # He smiled. I had never realized how goofy my smile looked. " That 's the smartest thing we 'll ever do. " # I reached out, and we shook hands. Just for a moment, I had a weird feeling of... of history, of the first time ever that a person shook hands with his future self. " So what do you do now? How do you go back? " # " Oh, that 's easy. I just- " And just like that, he was gone. # And so were his notes. Damn! I had n't anticipated that! The papers had all disappeared with him. # But my memory was in fine shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my system. So I grabbed a blank lab book and started furiously writing notes. Everything I had learned from future me, everything I could remember, I jotted down as fest as my pen would move. I also turned on my computer 's microphone and spoke my thoughts out loud as I wrote, so I would have the information in two different formats. That would help me to recall details if I had to reconstruct any missing pieces. # After three hours of writing and dictating, I was sure : I had it! There were pieces I would have to recreate, but I had the fundamentals of temporal math and the design of a time machine. With these notes to guide me, I would work through the rest of it. # I was just finishing the exclusion equation when the door buzzer sounded. Reluctantly I set down my notebook ; then I picked it back up, made another quick note, and set it down again. Finally, I walked to the door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " # But I knew, of course. " Art, it 's Gwen. I 'm all tom up over last night. Can I please come up? " # " Sure, Gwen. " I buzzed the front door open, and then I opened my door just in time to hear the front door swing shut and latch, two floors down from me. Then I heard her light, determined steps on the stairs. As usual, she wore comfortable sneakers, so they did n't make much noise on the carpet. # Gwen stepped off the stairs and onto my floor, and for a moment, my breath caught. There she was, the woman who could drive me to obsession, inspire me to challenge the very laws of physics to get her back. Her blonde hair hung stringy and straight, its usual luster cloaked, like she had been too distraught to wash it last night. Then I noticed she wore the same jeans and shirt as last night. That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really not herself at all. # As she drew closer, 1 could see her blue eyes behind those strands of hair, and they were clouded with tears. Usually that was enough to melt my will ; but future me had said that this time I would be too stubborn, and I would only make her cry worse. And then she would run away, hoping I would chase after her ; but I would be even more stubborn, and I would n't. And she would just keep running, right out of my life. Unless I changed our future. # Gwen walked over and stood in front of me, trembling, like she wanted to hug me but did n't know if she would be welcome. " Art, can we... try to... fix this? " # " Oh, Gwen... " I took her hands, and I held them out slightly away from her sides, so I could really look at her : short, cute, funny, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I deserved. Just the kind of woman I could spend twenty years missing. # But not if I changed the future-just not in the way future me had expected. " Sorry, Gwen, it 's over. You 're not worth twenty years. Goodbye. " I let go of her hands, slid back into my apartment, and closed the door before she could get that shocked look off her face. # And then she reacted, screaming and pounding on my door ; but I went back to my notes, ignoring the noise. After several minutes, she stopped pounding, but then my phone started ringing. I turned it off so I could concentrate. I was so buried in my studies, I never noticed when Gwen gave up and left. # I was sure : From these notes, I was sure I had the secrets of time travel, which were worth a Nobel Prize and so much more. And without the distractions of Gwen and a ruined career, with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much ahead. Twenty years? Hah! I could do it in three. # I laughed at future me, so hung up on Gwen. I would be rich and famous. I could move up to supermodels, so why waste all that on her? He needed Gwen, but I did n't. I was better than him, I was going places! I would be fine without her. # Just fine.
