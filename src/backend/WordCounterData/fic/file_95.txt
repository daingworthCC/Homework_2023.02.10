1013941 A.J. slammed the door of the pickup. " Ready, " he said. Dad backed down the driveway. A.J. shivered. It was six o'clock and freezing, but the strong morning sun promised warmer temperatures. It had been colder than normal over the past week, and the ground and ponds were already frozen. " After we check on the cows, " Dad said, " you should have some time to practice roping. " A.J. flexed his fingers inside his gloves. His hands and wrists automatically went through the motions he 'd been practicing. He wanted to enter the rodeo, and had been working at roping and tying calves. The best professionals could break from the gate on horseback, rope a calf, dismount, and hog-tie the calf in less than ten seconds. So far, A.J. needed closer to a minute and a half, but he 'd only been at it a few months. The pickup bounced down the red dirt road, and A.J. began to warm up under the blast of the heater. In a few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of binoculars from the glove compartment. The black blobs of cows on the far hill took shape through the lenses. The herd was clustered around the pond. A.J. guessed they wanted the water locked under the ice. " Better check the tank, " A.J. said. The windmill-powered water pumps sometimes froze, leaving the cows with nothing to drink. Dad drove across the pasture. When he reached the thick bunch of cows, he leaned on the horn and began to slowly push through them. A.J. held a whip out the window, gently swishing it to encourage the lazier cows to move. As they crested the hill, they heard frantic lowing from one cow and an answering bellow from another. Dad stopped the pickup, and he and A.J. stared grimly at the frozen pond. A calf lay on the ice in the middle of the pond. A cow, no doubt the calf 's mother, stood onshore, bawling desperately. The calf struggled to get up but slipped and fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Too warm. A.J. knew that the situation was urgent. If the calflay there too long, she could melt through the ice and drown. Dad eased the pickup down the hill and stopped at the edge of the pond. " No telling how long she 's been there, " he SEiid. " The ice could be about melted through. I do n't think we can risk it. " " But, Dad... " Dad shook his head. " It 's just not safe. " A.J. watched the calf, whose eyes were wide with fright. " Let me go, " A.J. begged. " I 'm light-the ice will hold me. It 's her only chance! " " I 'm sorry, son. " Dad looked as if it hurt him to say it. A.J. thought quickly. " You could tie a rope to me, " he said. " I 'll go out on my stomach to spread out my weight. If the ice cracks, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within roping distance. " Dad 's brow furrowed, and A.J. saw him waver. " All right, " Dad said. " Let 's hurry. " They secured a rope around A.J. 's waist. A.J. carried a second rope with him to lasso the calf. It 'll be just like rodeo practice, A.J. thought, trying to stay calm. He walked out a few feet onto the ice, then dropped to his stomach and crawled. The ice was thinner out where the calf was. She lay in a pool of meltwater. seeing A. J., she scrambled harder to get up. " Easy, girl, " A.J. said. His heart leapt as he heard the groan of ice cracking. The calf continued to struggle, the whites of her eyes showing in fear. A.J. swallowed his own fear. With frozen fingers, he coiled his rope and made a loop. He took a deep breath, then threw the rope. It fell just short. As the calf bawled, A.J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought, inching closer to the calf. He stopped when he heard the ice groan again. A.J. knew he had little time. He focused on the calf 's head, then threw the rope. Success! The loop settled around the calf 's neck, and A. J. pulled it snug. A.J. threw up his hand, rodeo style, to indicate that he was finished, and began to edge back toward shore. Once safe, he started pulling in the rope. The calf skidded easily across the smooth ice. In a couple of minutes, she was back on solid ground, where her mother was waiting. " Good job, son, " Dad said, loosening the rope from the calf 's neck. A.J. 's adrenaline caught up with him, and he did n't feel cold anymore. " I wonder what my time was, " he said shakily. Dad smiled. " I was n't keeping track, " he said, " but I 'd say it was fast enough. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calf lay there too long, she could melt through the ice and drown.
