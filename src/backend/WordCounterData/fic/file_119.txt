1018641 I am introduced to the friend of a friend. We converse and discover that as a child he lived next door to my grandfather. " I 'm sorry to say so, " he says, " but your grandfather once gave our dog a beating. " <p> My friend 's friend lived on the farm next door to my grandfather 's house. I ca n't believe that my grandfather beat their dog. My friend 's friend does not seem sorry about what he said, he is smiling. I say that it seems completely unlikely that my grandfather would have done such a thing -- my voice quavers, and I do n't want to talk any more with him. <p> My grandfather allegedly beat his neighbor 's dog. I ca n't believe it. He was in his seventies at the time and was, if possible, quieter and more sorrowful than he 'd been before. Nonetheless, I see the scene before me, he has a stick in his hand and starts beating the dog. It whimpers and tries to avoid the blows, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he casts the stick aside and goes into the house. All next day I think about him. I remember him as very tall and thin. He walked with a slight stoop, quite simply because my grandparents lived in a house with a very low ceiling. He was also stooped outside, it became a habit over the years. <p> A few days later I meet my friend 's friend again. Meanwhile he has telephoned his father, and now the story is different. Their dog -- a rottweiler -- had tried to steal my grandfather 's hens so he gave it a whack across the snout. One whack. <p> I am relieved that the story is done with and can see the humor in it. I phone my mother to tell her about it. I tell her : I met the friend of a friend who told me he grew up on the farm next door to grandfather. My mother interrupts me, trying to place him, she might remember his parents, she says. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that grandfather beat their dog and she exclaims, " Yes he could very well have done that. " I get annoyed and say that that was not the case, he did n't do it. <p> I get a letter from my mother. She sends a picture. In the picture grandfather is sitting on the lawn in front of his house. He has a wreath of dandelions on his head. A group of laughing children are sitting around him. I recognize all of them. I am in the picture, too. My mother has enclosed a short note. She writes, " I found the picture in a shoebox, I had forgotten all about it, and think you should have it. " <p> He is tall and pale in the wind there on the lawn in the flat landscape. The children, that 's us. We sit on the lawn with all the dandelions. We braid a yellow wreath for Grandpa. He is sitting in the grass amongst the children with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin. They are adult, they laugh and photograph the scene. Inside in the front room it is dark. The fat dog lies in the corner and sleeps. I am the child, am now alone. I have risen and stand in the dark room. That clock. It strikes once each quarter hour. It is warmer indoors. The dog 's name is Lady( he says lee-dy). Behind the house lie the fields. They reach as far as the eye can see and further. <p> The sorrowful flower-wreathed face as a painting. Long and pale. That one expression. All strength has long since abandoned that face. I have to get something, but have forgotten what it is. I stand still in the room. The dock strikes each quarter of the hour. I wake when the dock strikes once. The room is dark, but my eyes have grown accustomed to the darkness. <p> The yellow dandelions wreathe the pale tortured face. " Sit with us, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his trouser leg. He sits with difficulty on the lawn. A faint smell of urine hangs around him. <p> It occurs to me that I have never seen a flatter landscape than the one at my grandfather 's. For years I have planned to go to the tidal flats, but I never got there. Maybe it is flatter. I have always wanted to travel on a desert. It has to be flat there. <p> All the grandchildren run around his legs, one sees that clearly in the photograph, he looks unwell. The family -- the children and their children have forced their way in. They are in the house, they are in the garden and he has no interest in them and theirs. <p> Childhood memories are also based on visions. Stills ; isolated pictures of the old man on the lawn. Still lifes ; the person as object, grandfather with fat dog at his side, grandfather with a dandelion wreath around his face. <p> We have to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark room where we three children wait for the adults. In his hand, the long white hand, in his hand, the lean wrinkled hand, he has a bar of milk chocolate. He gives it to my brother and nods. Then he takes out his purse, he opens the coin compartment and picks out a ten-crown piece. He hands my brother the coin. My brother says thank you. He does not look happy, he glances sidewise at my sister and me. We see the chocolate in his brown little hand. He has put the coin in his pants pocket. My mother comes out in the doorway and speaks, her voice is hard, as when we have been up to mischief. Grandfather fetches a dented tin box. He removes the lid and holds it out to my sister and me. We both step forward. The tin box is full of different buttons. We may each choose one, he says. <p> Memory 's fictional pictures. My grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long time I will tell how my grandfather beat a dog that tried to steal his hens. If my grandfather could overhear that conversation, I do n't think he would have anything against it. My mother said, " Yes he could very well have done that, " and the story is almost remembered now. The friend of a friend remembered wrong, in his recollection the scene was lucid ; the dog whimpered, and he was the child who understood that the old man on the neighboring farm had beaten their dog. It had used the last of its strength to crawl home. Now the dog lies in the yard beaten and whimpering before my eyes as it lies before the eyes of the boy. He squats down and cares for the dog, his father appears and together they carry the dog out to the kitchen. <p> I keep my grandfather out of this. I hold the picture of him out. I want to hold it right up to my face. I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so close to my eyes. It has to do with perspective. It has nothing to do with the grandfather. The picture does not show the old man in the grass. I insist. <p> He sits at the dining table with the checked oilcloth. He mashes the overcooked potatoes into the sauce. He continues until it is a sleek brown mash, then he lifts his fork with a little mashed potato to his mouth. He swallows with great difficulty and has to wash it down with milk. The clock strikes once, he turns his thin face to me and says, " I have such a small throat that I ca n't swallow a pea. " We both look at the peas on his plate. Later he goes out to the kitchen and spills the peas into the dog 's bowl. The fat black dog hurries to the bowl and eats. <p> But the story, there is a story. The story I am in the process of delivering. Then it will exist somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and described it. The grandfather exists. It has occurred and exists on paper, in my head and I want to add : Grandfathers exist all over the world, some of them have once or several times beaten a dog. Grandfathers sit in high grass surrounded by grandchildren. Friends of friends remember wrong. I have n't thought about my grandfather in years. On my desk is a framed photograph. <p> <p> By Helle Thornvig Christensen <p>
