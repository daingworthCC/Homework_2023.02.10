4023241 1961 // August. // When Tip is standing in the doorway as he is right now, it can only mean one thing. I brace myself. He shouts, eyes pleading : // " Milk! " // After two and a half months, I 'm starting to get used to it. Very jarring at first, but now I 'm practically a pro. I counter, with excellent timing : // " Paint! " // Aha. Got him. He was n't ready for that. // " Paint? " // I raise my head from the potato chip coupon I 've been laying out with blue pencil for the past ten minutes and arch my right eyebrow, which is all he needs. Sketchy ignores us, as always. // " Faaassssssssinating. " It 's like a gas leak from Tip 's mouth and he darts back down to his office. // And I am reminded, grateful : This can be a pretty fun place to work. // * * * // June. // Who am I? I am Happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- it 's my name. A nickname, to be more precise, which I acquired relatively late in life, as those things go. From a teacher of mine in college, freshman year. And because of that it will always be who -- not what -- I am. // I wear it proudly, my sleeve 's own Purple Heart. // Me : twenty-one years old, Caucasian male of mixed Anglo-Italian origin, olive-skinned, round tortoise-shell horn-rimmed glasses, hair sort of like Brandon De Wilde 's in Shane, otherwise not interesting to look at. Or at least that 's what the evidence would suggest. // Which is fine by me, because I 'm the one doing the looking. I 'm a graphic designer -- I pretty much see the world as one great big problem to solve ; one typeface, one drawing, one image at a time. Life is a life-long assignment that must be constantly analyzed, clarified, figured out, and responded to appropriately. // I am inquisitive, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I 'm wary of any sort of unfamiliarity I am also quickly and easily bored by routine. I grew up in the eastern mid-Atlantic region of the United States, raised Protestant -- the United Church of Christ -- but have become very much of the " religion is the opiate of the people " school( the sole piece of common sense I gleaned from a course on Marxist theory, senior year), which of course I have elected to keep from my roundly nice, doting parents, lest they call the police. But I am close to my family, the way you are close to other people in a small crowded elevator that has temporarily stalled but will be moving any minute now. And as far as I was concerned, that minute was almost here. // Let 's see, what else. I am convinced that ALL sports are a sanctioned form of mass-demonic worship, that cathedrals and museums have traded roles in the greater culture, and that Eve Arden is woefully underappreciated by society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, cracking your neck, secret decoder rings, glass tea kettles, whoopie pies, and television test patterns. And -- ahem -- graphic designers. That should do for now. // Wait, I 'm forgetting something. Oh. // I do not write poetry. // But most of all : I am eager to start my career as a newly certified Bachelor of the Arts in Graphic Design, with a very specific goal -- acquiring a job at the advertising agency of Spear, Rakoff & Ware ; two states away, up in New Haven, Connecticut. // Why? Simple. // It 's where Winter Sorbeck started. Long ago. // Now, yes -- Winter, the teacher in question who christened me, my GD instructor during my first year at State -- is a whole other story. And certainly one with no small amount of pain. But however bullying, severe, terror-inducing, and unnerving he was( and boy, was he), he was equal parts mesmerizing, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any teacher I 'd had, before or since. By the end of that spring semester he abruptly quit the faculty and vanished. I would have gladly dropped out to follow him anywhere, but no amount of amateur detective work revealed where that might be. So I bided my time, worked for the next three years to get my degree, and upon graduation decided : If I could n't be where Winter was now, I 'd go where he 'd been. In the course of solving one of his earlier assignments I discovered that he started his career at Spear, Rakoff & Ware, and if that was good enough for him, it would be good enough for me. // Mandatory, actually. // And proving difficult. No surprise there -- if Winter was anything, he was difficult, as would be anyplace associated with him. But no doubt worth the trouble. I approached the firm early, in March, three months before graduation. My initial inquiry went unanswered, as did my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual First Fiction award), and the letter of recommendation I 'd extorted from the dean 's secretary. By May I was desperate, so I telephoned. The voice that greeted me hummed with the same welcome slow tone I knew from three years earlier, when I 'd called for help on that gum wrapper label design problem for Winter. It was Milburne " Sketchy " Spear -- the head of the art department. He did n't remember me and I did n't remind him -- I wanted a clean start. The years had not changed his enthusiasm : // " Oh, you do n't want to work here. " // " Um, yes sir, I do. " // " Really? " // " Yes sir. " // Silence. // " Hello? " // " Sorry, I 'm inking. Mind 's a porch screen when I 'm inking. I 'm trying to do a crowd scene with a Number 5 Pedigree pen tip. Should be using a Radio 914. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, never could. God, I stink. Would n't you rather work someplace else? Where people did n't stink? " // What? " No sir, I 'd like to work for your firm. You know, to sort of get my feet wet. " Dreadful. Why did I say that? // " Heh. " He sounded like a lawnmower trying to start. " Heh. That 's what I thought. I mean, that 's what I thought when I got here. You know when that was? " // " No. I -- " // " You know dirt? " // " Dirt? " // " Dirt. " // " Um, yes. Dirt. " // " Well, I started here the year before they discovered it. " // " I see. " // " Heh. " // " At least... it must have been spotless when you arrived. " // " Heh-heh. Can you airbrush? " // " Yes, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // " Did you receive my rsu -- " // " Do you know what I 'm doing right now? " // " Uh, drawing a crowd scene with a... Number 5 Pedigree pen tip? " // " No, that 's done. Now I 'm trying to decide what kind of face the potato chip should have. That 's always the question. Everything 's a question. " // " Pardon? " // " For this newspaper ad. A whole half-pager, due by five. Everyone signed off on it yesterday -- the crowd, see, they 've all filed out into the street to worship a giant potato chip. " // " I see. " // " Because it 's a Krinkle Kutt. One of our biggest accounts. " // " Right. " // " Six stories tall. " His tone was casual, as if he was telling me about his brother-in-law. " So, exactly what sort of expression should it have on its face? Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a Krinkly Kollosus, and looked up to by all these tiny people, who adore it so. " // " Well... it 's obvious to me. " // " That right? " // " It should look chipper. " // " Heh. " // " So to speak. " Boy, was I making this up. Pure hokum. " You know, not so smug. He does n't want to frighten everyone. I mean, I 'd be wary of a protean jagged slab of tuber towering over my fellow citizens, our fate in his many, many eyes. Especially if he 's been fried in lard. Which he has, I hope? " // " Heh. You still want to work here? " // " Definitely. " //
