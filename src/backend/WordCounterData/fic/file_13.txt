1001741 " If you do n't sit your stinkin ', useI less butt back down in that shopping cart, I swear I 'll bust your greasy face in T ' she screamed at the 3-yearold child in front of her. He studied her face, decided she was serious, and put his leg back inside the cart. He was standing near the front end of the cart, amidst an assorted pile of cigarette boxes, egg cartons, and pop bottles. He did n't want to sit down anyway because of the soft, uncomfortable load in his pants that had been there all afternoon and it felt cold and squishy when he moved too much. He rarely had accidents like that, but when he did, Mama sometimes made him keep it in his pants all day to " teach him a lesson. " Jerome was only three, but he had already learned many such lessons. He 'd never seen Sesame Street, never heard of Fountain Square-he did n't even know that he lived in Cincinnati. But he knew the important thingslike never mess with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you woke her up, especially if she had somebody in the bed with her. And never touch the hot thing that Mama used to light her cigarettes, even if the mysterious orange and blue fire that comes out of it liked to tease you and dance for only a moment before running away. Because Mama once had caught Jerome playing with the lighter, and she made the fire come out and she held his hand right over the flame, but it was n't his friendly fire dancer, but a cruel red soldier that made his hand scream and made him dizzy with pain and he could smell something like the meat Mama cooked, but it was his hand. When she stopped she had washed his hand with cool water and soothed him with warm hugs and wrapped the place where the fire soldier had stabbed him with salve and bandages. She told him that she had done it " for his own good " and to " teach him a lesson. " He had tried to ## tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but she was n't listening, and he had given up, thankful for the hugs and the silence. One other lesson that Jerome had learned was never, never stay near Mama when she sniffed the white stuff. She got it from a man named Leroy who smelled too sweet and smiled too much. When he leaves, you hide behind the couch and hope Aunt Bessie comes over because sometimes Mama yells and gets her belt or her shoe and hits, and hits, and hits.... And sometimes she just goes to sleep on the floor and it gets dark and you cry and your tummy feels tight and hurty, but at least there 's no shoe to run away from. Once Aunt Bessie had found Jerome curled up behind the couch sucking his thumb. His pajamas were soaked and smelly and he had been shivering and hungry. Mama had been gone all day. She had told him not to leave the room, and he had been really, really good, but he was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to her apartment and given him a warm bath, some hot soup and some of Ronnie 's sleepers, even though she had to pin the back of them so they would n't fall off. Then Mama had come and she and Aunt Bessie had yelled and screamed so much that Jerome had to hold his ears while he lay curled on the foot of Aunt Bessie 's bed. Finally Mama started crying and Aunt Bessie was saying stuff like, " I know, honey, " and Jerome knew he was going back home. Mama had hugged him and kissed him and held him close to her until he fell asleep that night. Jerome had felt so warm and special and golden-he wanted to feel like that forever. He knew his Mama loved him. She had bought him a GI Joe man last week and it was n't even his birthday or Christmas or anything, and most days she combed his hair and dressed him in clean clothes and told him to say, " Yes, Ma'am " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days, she would hug him and smile and say, " You know you 're my best baby boy, do n't you Jeromey? You know you 're my baby, do n't you? " And he would smile and that warm, golden feeling would start at his toes and fill him all the way up to his smile. Even though Mama had yelled at him, today was a good day. Mama always yelled-it was no big deal.( Some days he yelled back at her. Then she would slap him and he 'd cry and he 'd cuss at her and then she would slap him until his head hurt. So mostly he ignored her.) But today was a good day, a shiny day, he thought. The sun was bright gold outside against a clear blue sky. And inside the grocery store there were so many colors and sounds and lights that Jerome just grinned. Mama called it the big store and it was always crowded when they went. Other children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass very close to each other. Jerome liked to pretend he was driving a big, fine silver car down the expressway. Sometimes the cart would be a tank, as he passed cautiously through rows of armed cling peaches and silent sentinels that looked like boxes of Frosted Flakes. And at the checkout lane, the armies rolled smoothly down the long black road that disappeared under the counter. He? started to ask Mama where it went, but it was more fun to imagine that it went to a secret hideout where only sweet potatoes and boxes of oatmeal were allowed. When they got home from the grocery store, Jerome sat on the floor and watched Mama stack the boxes and cans on the shelf. She was whistlinghe had never heard her whistle before and he loved the way she laughed as he tried to imitate her. She changed his clothes( and did n't even yell at him for not being a big boy) and gave him two cookies and an apple. Then she went ONE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out, she had changed clothes and Jerome thought he had never seen anything so lovely. She had on her sparkly fancy dress that Jerome liked to touch. " Mama will be right back, baby, " she told him. " I just have to go see Mr. Leroy for a minute. You stay right here and wait for me, you hear? " Jerome started to cry, but he did n't want Mama to lose her good mood, so he just nodded and bit his lip. The door closed and he could hear her high heels clicking on the steps. Then it was very, very quiet. After he finished both his cookies and the apple had turned brown on the white parts, Jerome looked for something to do. It was getting dark and he wanted GI Joe to sit with him because the shadows on the wall were getting long and scary. He found GI Joe on the floor next to Mama 's bed, right next to her cigarette lighter that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and for a time he used it as a gun for Joe, then it was a log for Joe to jump over, then it was an enemy for Joe to attack. Finally Jerome started idly flicking the little red handle. At first it just made a scratchy sound and the smell made him cough and remember how he got that hard brown place in the palm of his hand. Then he remembered the tiny fire dancer, and he wondered if it still lived in there with firesword soldier. After numerous flicks, he got the fire to stay on. He grinned with delight. The dancer was there, smiling at him and bowing for him, changing from splendid orange to icy green to iridescent purple. The lighter flame flickered magically, making golden the purple shadows on the wall. With sudden inspiration, Jerome shouted, " Hey Joe, we got a torch! " as he and GI Joe marched around the kitchen table. Jerome crawled under the table then, flicking the lighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe. They fought shadows and monsters ; they blew up cities and kingdoms. Jerome made the sound effects and GI Joe dutifully followed his general into combat. As the mighty battle came to its climax, Jerome crawled up on a chair and stood on the kitchen table, waving his arms triumphantly. Mama would kill me, he thought momentarily, if she saw me up here, but the thought passed as GI Joe fought the terrible mountain man by the light of only a single torch. Suddenly the tiny light of GI Joe 's torch was huge and bright as the tip of the one curtain in the window touched the flame. Jerome heard a loud " whoosh " and then he turned in terror to see the whole window covered with harsh red flames which crawled and licked and jumped along the windowsill. Jerome scrambled down from the table and ran to his hiding place behind the couch. " Mama said stay here and wait for her, " he told himself. " I know she 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner of the sofa and watched the flames consume the boxes of cereal and macaroni that Mama had just bought. When it reached the bottle of Big K soda, Jerome watched, fascinated, as the soda bubbled, then fizzed. When it finally exploded with a loud sizzling pop, Jerome jumped back behind the sofa, coughing and wheezing from the heat and smoke. He curled up in his usual position then, thumb in his mouth, crying softly. He thought about his Mama and how pretty she was. He wondered if GI Joe would ever find his way back. And he wondered how he could see so many colors with his eyes closed.
