4163241 She 's decided -- even though he 's married, even though there 's Nathan, even though the artists pillory the unfaithful despite their own eyes patrolling the Retreat 's cafeteria like guards hoping to catch someone, anyone, escaping a marriage. At night she hears them. Husband and wife -- but not his wife, but not her husband -- moaning all the things they 've always wanted to moan, just to see if they can, just to hear what comes back. Or maybe it 's the same, tired moanings and it 's not any different, not really. Carrie does n't know, she 's never been married, but she 's decided : she 's going to fuck Jonah. There 's a bit in her act about sleeping with a married guy, and while it goes over, she always wants to end it by saying it 's a lie, none of it happened, there 's no such thing as marriage, she 's never had sex. That would be going too far the other way, but sometimes she prefers extremes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep with that married guy even though she would have, even though she tried to -- hard. But she 's got the joke. She tells it to Jonah at lunch. Every spent body at the Retreat shuffles into the cafeteria and slumps near the counter in a paintsplattered line, eyeing each other as if the amount of art on their clothes says something about the success of their residency. It should be the opposite, Carrie knows -- the cleanest artist, the artist who does n't spill, who keeps his plaster where it belongs -- that 's doing the best work. Which would be Carrie. Having spent her own morning working on sleep, she 's peach-scented clean after a shower, and it 's hardly her fault that among all the painters, sculptors, carpenters, and installation artists, the Retreat admitted a comedian. There 's a composer, too : Deborah, a gray-haired woman tapping her foot at the head of the line, but she, at least, is spotted with ink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " Are n't you getting anything done? " Jonah asks before slurping a spoonful of miso. He 's got steady hands and poor manners, a face like a mask at the end of a long Halloween, askew eyes bulging over clifted cheeks, and a shaved, wrinkled skull. He looks like an artist -- lovely for being ugly, the sort ofthing Germans probably have a word for or maybe the Japanese.. ' : '. " I 'm trying to get something done now, " she says. " So I 'm sleeping with this married guy, and he says he wants me to do something his wife wo n't. " " But you already wrote this joke, no? " " That 's not the point. This, right here, performing is what I do. So I ask him, ' What wo n't your wife do '? " " You 're maybe not getting the point of the residency. " " Die. " Jonah pauses, full spoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? " " Die, " she says. " Then the real punch line is, ' O thank God, I thought you were going to say butt stuft. ' " Jonah slurps, then tears a chunk of rye in two and drowns half in his soup while the seats around them fill with the clamor over how they ca n't believe it 's been two weeks, how they ca n't believe there are still two more. ' - ' :,. " That 's the joke, " she says, when she ca n't take his silence. He swallows. " Is it? " And she should hate him, but he 's got this **25;345;TOOLONG mutt of an accent and it 's like everything about him, such monstrous beauty, even in the ceramics he spends the day molding, painting, firing. They 're majestic, valuable, each one towering high above her head, some kind of pastel temple to a pagan god that never existed but should have, one that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clouds. And Carrie would smash every one just to hear him say wombat. " I did n't say it was a good joke, " she sighs. And it 's not a good joke. though it 's better than it was when she said anal. Mostly, it 's not a true joke, and she resolves to drop it from her act until she remembers it 's the bridge to sex where all her good jokes are anyway, the ones that have made her, as much as she is such a thing, known. After lunch, she walks Jonah down the mountain to his studio, all the artists marching like a particularly ineftectual army toward the antique white church where their studios threaten. Even with the cross having been replaced by a weather vane, it 's a menacing building, not particularly large but with the ability to loom in judgment even over Carrie, whose studio is back over the bridge in the Retreat 's main office. It should be spectacular, Jonah is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what this means, not really. " Maybe God just got caught up in the real estate crisis, " she says. Jonah sets a hand on her shoulder and squeezes hard enough the intimacy becomes a punishment, becomes intimacy. They 've stopped walking and she 's staring into his dark eyes and listening to the river beneath them and the song of distant birds and there 's a glint of his wedding ring, but she can ignore that, now, for this idyllic moment. " Carrie, " he says, " you 're the least funny person I 've ever met. " She spends the afternoon in her office because she feels obligated to, the way she feels obligated to use every takeout napkin whether or not she 's made a mess. She 's usually made a mess. A small, beige office left utterly without personality by a recently deceased assistant director, the Retreat decided to use it to branch out to artistic communities " underserved by the existing nonprofit support structure. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Nathan, reading, compulsively, about herself on the Internet, she felt profoundly underserved. But now that her days are all guilt and boredom, she 's certain the existing nonprofit support structure was right to ignore her. If the director, an aging cycling and marijuana enthusiast, were to knock on her door and demand to know what she 's doing, she 'd say she 's gathering material. It 's true, if she means gathering material goods that will welcome her home. She wants to be productive, but over the first two weeks at the Retreat she has managed exactly one new bit, not even funny, not even a joke. She told it the first week when the twenty-odd residents of the Retreat took a break from art and adultery to tour the studios and, as if doing her a kindness, came to her oftice and sat on file cabinets and moved ferns to listen. " OK, " she said, " so once I was dating this guy when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, six years. We 'd been dating for only a few months when it happened, but it was the biggest tragedy of my life. We 'd been serious. I thought I was going to marry him, and he thought the same about me. We talked about it. Kids, too. We had a name picked out. Anyway, it was a car accident. But the worst part was, since I was n't his wife, his family did n't know how to treat me in those awful days after it happened. Like, at the funeral, his brother would n't even go down on me. " : ' i And here is where there might have been laughter, might have been any noise other than the silence of uncomfortable blinks and embarrassed hearts, but nobody did anything except for Deborah, who put her hand on Carrie 's shoulder and told her how sorry she was. Then they were all gone, escaped, even Jonah, and Carrie was n't sure how long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was true. She 'd been trying to make the experience a joke for the entire two weeks, for years before that, maybe from the moment she got the call from his mother already at the hospital saying there 's no need to rush. This is what she 's come to the Retreat for, what she promised, to complete a new set of material even though she knows that 's not how comedy works. You take it to clubs, you tinker, you cut. " You hone, " she 'd told Jonah. She hones. This involves a lot of hypothetical pet shopping on the Internet, but sooner or later even that ca n't distract her -- in her heart she 's already settled on a baby lemur -- so she thinks about David who is dead and Nathan who is not and Jonah who is married. Nothing about any of this seems fucking funny. And there 's the obscenity, too. She spends hours in the office worrying the only funny thing about a thirty-one-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular trouble. Most of her comedian friends are men, some of them men she 's slept with, like Nathan, and not once has he ever stopped rifting to ask if he should be working some color other than blue. " It 's not that I do n't want kids, " he said once, after he 'd rolled oft her, still sweaty, as if he 'd been thinking about not having kids with her specifically. " It 's that I do n't want one of today 's kids. They 're too fucking American, all achievements and morals and technology. So every time after I cum, I know there 's a chance I just spawned one of these Space George Washington, but abortion is wrong, so I think ' Great, now I 've got to live with having murdered this girl. ' Hey, there 's something there. Make some coffee, baby, I 'm going to hone it. " The memory makes her hands fists, so she mentally erases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the sun falls behind the mountain, she feels some sense of satisfaction that, while she has n't birthed anything, she 's at least killed everything. Went the other way with it again, too far, and now all of her jokes are odd monologues, fractured stories almost made dirtier by their absences, like a stranger asking, " Have you heard the one about the girl? " then running away laughing. " In this scenario, I 'm the stranger, " she explains to Jonah. " And maybe the girl. " They 're at one of the bonfires held, more or less, nightly by the river, a circle of Adirondack chairs recently battered and reclaimed from a flood circling what to Carrie does n't quite deserve the title of bonfire. But the staff, bored and gossiping in the shadows, carry the wood and chase down the chairs so they can call the knee-high flames burning the dark whatever they want. " That 's something, " Jonah says, slurping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carrie want to confess It 's terrifying to see all the stars! and maybe her brain 's all mixed up. " Sometimes I do n't think you take me seriously, " she says. " I definitely have that feeling sometimes. Mornings. Afternoons. Tuesdays. " But Jonah is making a crude hand gesture, and everyone but Carrie laughs and does it back to him, an artists ' inside joke she 's outside of. " Saw you on TV once, " he says. " I told you that. " " But you do n't think I 'm funny? " " You were quite funny. " " Just not now? " " You are definitely not being funny right at this moment, no, " he says. When she asks if he would like her better if she were funny all the time, Jonah meets her eyes, a match 's worth of fire still caught in them, and says of course not. But she 's thought about this, always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yes, she wants to be funny all the time. Making people laugh is what she does, what is supposed to make her happy. Or maybe it 's that failing to make people laugh is what makes her unhappy. It 's small comfort that comics who are on all the time -- Nathan, for one -- seem even more unhappy, lit lamps in empty rooms. It could be any other day at the Retreat -- from breakfast to lunch to dinner to kindling to fire to embers as pairs sneak away wearing wedding rings, mismatched. Carrie and Jonah are two of the last artifacts when she takes his calloused hand -- her a quarter drunk and three-quarters sick -- and makes him walk her back to her room. This is the first time she 's held him like this, but she does n't care, and if Jonah does, he does n't say and he does n't let go. They walk along the river, some noisy darkness infecting their silence, until they turn up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the only thing she can think is that she might rather have him itch her legs than have sex. Might not, too. Outside the dorms where they both stay they run out of courage for beginnings or endings. She watches a couple kissing in a far stand of trees while Jonah studies the moon. Neither says anything until anything is all there is to say. " What was the name? " Jonah asks. " Eor the baby. " She ca n't think of a reason why Jonah -- not her mother, not her friends, not Nathan -- should be the first person she gives these unspoken syllables worn tbin in her mind. It was their thing, she and David 's, their last thing. " Persephone. ". : : ;.. He raises a crooked eyebrow. " Who knows if we could have actually done that to some poor kid, " she says. Now that she 's said the name aloud she feels calmer. They were never so close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no kids. Nothing has ever been alive. Nothing has ever been. " And for a boy? " " No, that 's for a boy, " she says. " Carrie Jr. for a girl. " He does n't laugh but kisses her forehead, makes a point of opening the door, stepping inside, closing it behind him, and standing tall and still for a moment behind the glass as if both of them understand what this means. When the woman in the trees moans, " Grab some dirt, " Carrie knows it 's time to go inside herself, and in her room, she locks the door then unlocks it, knowing exactly what she hopes will happen and what wo n't. She wakes, headached and puffy, somehow having slept, still waiting for the sound of his hard fist against her wooden door. At lunch, Jonah avoids her eyes while Carrie, arms shaking with a tray filled with that day 's particular ethnicity -- curried lentils and basmati @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- wanders among the coupled artists until she finds a man sitting alone, likely due to the performative nature of his facial hair, some kind of black chin curtain underneath a carnival barker 's mustache, hopefully the result of a bet or a rare, silly disease. " I thought I 'd met everyone, " she says. " I was at another one of these things in Virginia, " the man says, the pomade in his mustache catching crumbs from his injera. " Better or worse? " " Do n't know yet, " he says. " Bunch of prudes there, though. I could n't find any models. You want to model for me, honey? " This, maybe, is funnier than anything she 's ever said onstage, but the man, Cecil, is serious even if nothing about his face is. She says she 'll think about it. He nods and asks if any of the women are still up for grabs, and Carrie has no idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonah evading and Cecil leering, she spends the next few meals in her office, stopping by the cafeteria early to furtively fill paper bags with bread and the salad bar 's dryer options, until the director invites himself in one lunch to chat and stretch his leg on her office 's bookshelf, bicycle shorts bulging in her direction. " Laughter, like bicycling, can fix a person 's chi, " he 's saying, then claps like he 's just had a great idea and not a terrible one. " You 'll perform your new set on the last studio tour. The whole thing. We can set up the cafeteria. " Her instinct is to make an excuse, but she goes the other way, agrees just to be agreeable. Sick with the spirit, she calls a comedian friend back in Los Angeles who has been wanting to interview her for his podcast, but she 'd been avoiding him just like when he 'd tried to sleep with her. While Matt 's setting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about who else he 's sleeping with but everything about how his episode of the show is the most popular one. " Wait, " Matt says, " are you two fucking? " " Eor years. Does n't everyone know? " " I did n't, " he says. " But that 's great. Do you want to talk about it on the show? " She does not. Instead they talk vaguely about her career and what it 's like to be away from home and what she says to hecklers. " I love you. Do you want to get married? " she says. " That 's what I say. " " I expected something raunchy, " he says. " Just cutting out their guts and making gut calzones for everyone. " He pauses, repeats, " Gut calzones. Erom you, that 's what I expect. " She sighs. " I do n't like calzones, and that 's not who I want to be. " Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- reclined, feet atop her desk, window behind her open to a cool breeze and the low knocking of thunder over the mountain -- they talk about what it 's like to be a female comedian onstage and oft, and while she admits to not having any grand theories about it, she 's forming them as she speaks. " And when people say women are n't funny? " he asks. " Maybe they 're right, " she says. " But maybe funny is n't the only way to get laughs, and laughs are n't the only goal of comedy. Maybe the best comedy is the least funny. " " What 's that mean? " " No idea, " she says. " But it sounds true. " They talk about her looks -- comedy beautiful, movie ugly -- and her ruining all her material and what 's going to happen to her when she comes home with no material and no interest in doing comedy the way that has kept her fed and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next she 's not sure what 's happening to her e-mail, but the reaction to the show arrives angry and poorly spelled. Bloggers, comedians, her own worried agent -- there 's apparently something novel and terrifying about what she said. She wants to reassure everyone, including herself, quitting has never been an option, not really. Comedy is what she does, the only thing that 's hers, but she ca n't think of a good way to explain how boredom has forced her to remember that she can change for the better, too, that she can still become the person she was going to be until she became someone else. " That 's how you see it? " Jonah asks. They 're talking at the bonfires though tentatively, a silent printmaker purposefully moved into their circle who keeps trying to wander oft. " I think so, " she says. " But what if that person is n't funny? " he says. " When I was with David, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he always came to my open mies. I used to tell him that I wanted to come to his job and watch him ruin chairs. He made furniture, reupholstered, that sort of thing. " " My kind of guy, " Jonah says, and as if for emphasis holds up his hands full of new black burns, the kind of hands that never stop bleeding. " Mine, too, " she says. Cecil, wearing only a leather vest, beard dusted in ash, slithering a tattooed arm around a blond staft member, yells over the fire to ask again if Carrie will model. When Jonah wonders why she agrees, she says, " I 'm agreeable. " After getting her wine glass filled by a handsy abstract expressionist -- they 're mostly handsy abstract expressionists -- Jonah has disappeared, and rather than follow the flirting and giggles back to the dorm alone, she returns to the oftice where she reads each response to the podcast, so oftensive and supportive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sarcastic congratulations about her show being more popular than his and how next time he 's going to come out of the closet. She does n't know what to do with that, or any of it, so she texts back : / love you. Do you want to get married? There 's no response in the morning and she knows there never will be, but there is a hangover like her brain is playing Operation while she follows Cecil to his studio that is not in the church but in an old barn half up the mountain and half-covered in moss. While they walk, she can feel his eyes tracing her, and this bothers her exactly as much as how he does n't even try to put his arm around her like the blond woman. " Is it because in movies I only get to play the ftiend? " she asks. " I was n't painting her, " he says. " I was fucking her. " " Oh, " she says. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased with himself or her backside. The barn is a barn, tools on the wall and hay in the corner, the wet smell of it struggling to overcome the hair-fire scent of the space heater Cecil bends in front of, warming his hands. There 's no stool or stage, just a white wall with bare bulbs hanging from the rafters, swaying like the condemned in a draft. " Get naked, " Cecil says, as he thrashes around in a tub of paints. Without stopping to weigh her modesty, Carrie kicks off her shoes, unzips her jeans, pulls her T-shirt over her head. Then she hesitates for a moment, exhales, throws her underwear atop the pe, and stands naked in a halo of light. The draft studies her body more than the painter, and she studies her body more than the draft. The small mole on her side, the white scars on her thigh, the freckles mottling her sunburned shoulders -- what he 's keeping and what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none? This worries her more than the exposure. She 's offered other men this body and more. " Open your eyes. " She had n't realized she 'd closed them, and they open to her toes wiggling, hiding in the thin layer of dirt, as if they 're the most vulnerable part of her and not, as she decides while watching, so distant and small they 're barely her at all. She laughs, ca n't stop, bends at the waist and tries to cover her mouth. Then Cecil 's laughing, too, his chin beard shaking, and when they finally stop, Carrie naked on the ground, knees hugged to her chest, he asks with a toddler 's innocence what was funny. ' - " Everything, " she says. " It was great, " she tells Jonah. They 're eating drunken noodles and she 's surprised by how hungry standing frozen made her and by how much trouble Jonah 's heavy fingers are having with his chopsticks. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw it. " That night they go to his studio instead of the bonfire, and she walks among his sculptures as he laments how terrible they turned out and how he hates what he 's working on and how he 's depressed and how he wants to kiss her. And he does, right there in the middle of them all, and as it 's happening Carrie realizes she 's been wrong : they 're not part of some temple -- they 're people, people warming. loosening, melting down like candles. " I 'm sorry, " he says, still holding her arms. " I love my wife. " " I do n't love anybody, " she says, and moves away. " But I think I can. " In her room, door locked, she lies awake atop her blankets listening to the night 's gentle laughter, and she tries to remember all the different beds she 's lain in like this and the last sound before sleep. At Nathan 's, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a stoplight. With David, the window open, a breeze escaping with their breaths. In the morning, head again inflamed and unable to reclaim the curing sounds of the night before, she ignores her impending performance and goes to find Jonah. She needs to tell him something. She 's pretty sure she 'll have decided on what by the time she sees him, but his studio is locked and nothing about her knocking changes that. " You 're making an awful noise. " Deborah, the composer, stands with her headphones around her neck, the cord running back into her studio. " I 'm sorry, " Carrie says. " I did n't realize your studio was in here. " " I always ask for this room, " she says. " Come see. " It 's what 's left of the sanctuary after the rest has been cut up with studios and kilns and letterpresses. The ceiling rises to a sharp peak above walls so narrow Carrie can almost touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold the desk supporting a synthesizer and small laptop. At the far end of the room a stained-glass Jesus watches, holding his own flaming heart spreading bright and terrible light over the floor. " It 's amazing, " Carrie says. " I like it because it feels like the walls will crush me if I stop working. " " I have n't done any work, " Carrie admits, then realizes Jesus seems a little upset with this, what with his having offered her his burning heart and all. " You still have three days. " Carrie shrugs, and reaches out to trace the sharp tongue of flames. She considers a joke about how some people are afraid to get crushed by walls and some people by hearts, but that 's probably not funny and definitely not a joke. " I did n't do much work my first time here either, " Deborah says. " All these paintings filling the hallways, and I could only think that even if I wrote something I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed? " Deborah smiles. " I remembered I 'm not a person who cares about holding things. " - On her way out of the church Carrie rips oft a corner of a discarded charcoal drawing and writes. We decided Persephone would be a surgeon and slips it under Jonah 's door. That 's maybe funny. She does n't get a chance to ask him at the night 's bonfire as he carefully navigates so the flames are always between them, and she resorts to standing with Cecil. " I finished your painting, " he says. " It could have been better. " " I told you I always play the friend. " He rubs his beard then fters, " You could play a hot lawyer. " And she says thank you because it might be the nicest thing anyone has ever said to her. For the rest of her time at the Retreat she resolves to take walks, and this she accomplishes. Mornings she heads through the trees to a clearing far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the morning burns off and the insectsflee.Afternoons she heads the other way down toward the small town below where she gets coffee at a caf and eavesdrops on the locals ' discussion until they catch her. If she were to produce material now, it would be about Lyme disease and scones. Instead she fills her notebook with leaf etchings and potential caf names. Not that she 's going to open one, not at all, it 's just calming to have a dream again, as calming as Persephone 's would be with a tamarack out front and lemon muffins inside. There 's a day where her music sounds better than normal. There 's a day where she listens to nothing at all. There 's the last few hours before her show she waits out alone. That night the artists drink straight from wine bottles, touring the studios before the next day they pack their work away and another identical set arrives to replace them. Some of the paintings are wondrous, some terrible. Some are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studio the artists praise kindly the work. Carrie wonders if they 're ever jealous, and she supposes they must be, but it 's a feeling that exists outside of her and Deborah who, when her turn comes, shuts them all in the narrow room and plays a piece of music Carrie feels like she 's heard before but has n't. It 's the best thing any of them have done at the Retreat, she 's certain. Even Jesus, holding his own fiery heart, seems somehow content. Jonah 's studio is last, and in it his melted choir has grown to more than a dozen bright, slick figures the artists walk among but are careful not to touch. Except Carrie who pokes one. Then another. Jonah watches her, and she knows they are friends again as she feels them all and he does n't stop her. " Melted people? " Jonah says, as they walk together toward the cafeteria. " Most people say penises. " " What are they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny, " she says, and he is. In front of the salad bar a stool waits with a bottle of water and on either side desk lamps serve as spotlights. The staff whisper in the back, not even pretending to still be friends with the artists who shuffle in drunk and pleased and ready for a show. Carrie watches their hands. If they make fists, they wo n't laugh. If they perilously dangle empty wine bottles, they will. At her earliest open mies -- before she got the courage to go onstage herself -- she would sit in the back and watch the audience 's hands, telling herself it meant something, everything. It meant she 'd know even if she did n't, not really. These hands are loose, speckled with paint, reaching for each other for perhaps the last time as tomorrow wedding rings will be slipped on and good-byes will be waved. Tonight, they clap, and Carrie steps up to the stool, says thanks, and pauses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sunny glare of an audience 's attention. " I 'm going to try hard to be unfunny, " she begins. " But you should n't worry because I also tried hard to have an affair here and could n't manage that. " And they laugh like this is a joke. She does n't do a whole hour and she does n't do jokes, but Carrie stands in front of these people who sometimes feel like strangers, sometimes friends, sometimes fellow prisoners. When it 's funny, they laugh. When it 's not, they laugh anyway. Mostly they 're rapt as she talks about poor, dead David and their marriage that never happened and their daughter who was never born and why, suddenly, she needed them to be fimny. It 'd been years, and for a long time she did n't think about them at all because of the time when she thought about them too much. " And maybe I was just too young to understand how your life can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but she needs the pure, absolute devastation of the word even if, as she adds, " David probably thinks I 'm a whiner. " When it 's over, they cheer. Jonah puts an arm around her shoulder and kisses the top of her head, and Carrie falls into his chest for a long second before he escapes into the crowd. She should be grateftil as she knows there would n't be any happiness in being held longer when the release is certain, but even so she hopes to hear his knock on the door she 'll leave unlocked. Because she might not be able to avoid ruination. Because it 's something she wants right up until she returns to her room and finds the painting obscene and beautiful waiting atop the bed. Bare, the woman is still flushed and full and Carrie knows the only thing to do is walk back through this solemn final night and hang it in the cafeteria. Because that 's ftinny. She 's funny.
