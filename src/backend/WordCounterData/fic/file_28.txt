1004541 All her life, friends, family, and neighbors had kept a secret about Kathy. Then a chance remark by a charming stranger revealed the truth-and tu her world upside down. <p> Kathy Clarke was one of the hardest working girls in Mountainview School. In class, she frowned with concentration, puzzled things out, and asked questions. In the teachers " lounge, they often made good-natured fun of her. " Doing a Kathy Clarke " meant screwing up your eyes at a notice on the bulletin board, trying to understand it. She was a tall, awkward girl, not really bright, but determined to do wellalmost too determined. At the end of every school year, parent-teacher meetings were held, but nobody on the staff could remember who came to talk about Kathy. " Her father 's a plumber, " Aidan Dunne, the Latin teacher, said. " He put in the lavatories for us. " " I remember her mother came once, " the Irish teacher said. " She never took the cigarette out of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What good will it do Kathy, will it earn her a living? ' " " She has a big sister who comes too, " someone else remembered. " She 's the manager at the supermarket. I think she 's the only one who understands poor Kathy. " " Would n't it be great if the only worries we had were about the children working too hard and frowning too much with concentration? " said the principal, who had many more trying problems on his desk every day. He had little time left to worry about the Kathy Clarkes of this world. She would leave school and get some kind of a job ; maybe her sister would get her on at the supermarket. She would never get a higher education. She did n't have the background, or the brains. But she would survive. NONE OF THEM KNEW WHAT KATHY Clarke 's home life was like. If they thought about it at all, they might have assumed it was a house with too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, too many children, and not enough money. That would be the normal picture in their Dublin neighborhood. They could not know that Kathy 's bedroom had a built-in desk and a little library of books. Her sister, Fran, sat there every evening with Kathy until the girl 's homework was finished. In winter, there was a heater with portable cylinders of gas that Fran bought at a discount at the supermarket. Kathy 's parents laughed at the extravagance. All the other children had done their homework at the kitchen table and had n't it been fine? But Fran said it had not been fine. She had left school at 15 ; it had taken years for her to work her way up to a position of seniority, and there were still huge gaps in her education. The three boys had barely scraped by, two working in England and one a roadie with a pop group. It was as if Fran had a mission to get Kathy to make more of herself than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was letting Fran down. " You see, I 'm not really bright, Fran. Things do n't come to me like they do to some. You would n't believe how quick Harriet is. " " Well, her father 's a teacher, why would n't she be bright? " Fran sniffed. " You 're so good to me, Fran. When you should be dancing, you take time for my homework, and I 'm so afraid I 'll fail and be a disgrace to you after all your work. " " I do n't want to go dancing, " Fran would sigh. Kathy was 16, the baby of the family. Fran was 32, the eldest. She really should be married now with a home of her own, and yet Kathy never wanted Fran to leave. Home life would be unthinkable without her. Their mam was out a lot " getting things done, " which really meant playing slot machines. There would have been few comforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them. It was Fran who bought Kathy 's school uniform, explained the facts of life to her, took her to the theater and through the shops. And there was never a word of criticism from Fran about their parents. Sometimes, Kathy complained : " Mam takes you for granted, Fran. You bought her a lovely new cooker, and she still never makes anything in it. And Dad never says thank you when you bring him beer from the supermarket. He never brings you a present. " " He 's not the worst, " Fran said. " It 's not a great life with your head stuck down pipes all the time. " " Will you get married, do you think? " Kathy asked her once anxiously. " I 'll wait until you 're a grown-up, then I 'll put my mind to it. " Fran laughed when she said it. " But wo n't you be too old? " " Not at all. By the time you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my prime, " she assured her sister. " I thought you were going to marry Ken, " Kathy had said. " Yes, well, I did n't. And he went to America, so he 's out of the picture. " Fran was brusque. Ken had worked in the supermarket too. Mam and Dad said that he and Fran were sure to make a go of it. Kathy had been very relieved when Ken had left the picture. NEITHER OF KATHY 'S PARENTS WAS ABLE to go to the end-of-the-year parentteacher meeting. So Fran went and spoke about her little sister to the tired teachers, who had to see legions of parents and give a message of encouragement laced with caution to all. " She 's too serious, " they told Fran. " She tries too hard. She might take in more if she were to relax. " " She 's very interested, really she is, " Fran said. " She never neglects any of her homework. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? " Mr. Dunne asked. " No, she does n't want to take the time from her studying, you see. " " Maybe she should. " He was brusque, but pleasant. " I do n't think she should continue with Latin. " Fran 's heart sank. " But, Mr. Dunne, she tries so hard. She really does put in hours on it. Could I get her private lessons? It would be great for her to have Latin. Look at all the places she could go with a subject like that. " " She may never go to a university. " Poor Mr. Dunne was trying to let her down lightly. " But she has to. None of us have got anywhere, she must get a start in life. " " You have a good job yourself, Miss Clarke. I see you when I go to the supermarket. Could n't you get Kathy a job there? " " Kathy will never work in the supermarket. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry, " he said quietly. " No, I 'm sorry. It 's kind of you to take such an interest. Please forgive me for shouting. Just advise me what would be best for her. " " She should do something that she would enjoy, that she would n't have to strain at, " Mr. Dunne said. " A musical instrument, has she shown any interest? " " No. " Fran shook her head. " We 're all tone-deaf, even the brother who 's working for a pop group. " " Or painting? " " I ca n't see it myself-she 'd only fret over that too. " It was easy to talk to this kind man. It was good of him to care that poor Kathy should be happy and relaxed. She hated being so negative to his suggestions. " Well, I 'm sure you 'll think of something, Miss Clarke. " Mr. Dunne looked beyond her to the line of parents still to be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " Fran meant it. " You really do give your time, and care about the children. " Fran went to the bus stop, hands in pockets and head down. She passed through an annex on the way out and saw a notice announcing Italian lessons next September, an introductory course to the food, paintings, music, and language. It promised to be fun as well as educational. Fran wondered if something like that might be a good idea. But it was too dear. She had so many expenses. It would be hard to pay in advance. And suppose Kathy decided to take the whole thing too seriously? Then the cure might be worse than the disease. No, she would have to think of something else. At the bus stop, Fran met Peggy Sullivan, a checker at the supermarket. " They 'd put years on you, these meetings, would n't they? " the woman said. " There 's a lot of hanging about, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one knew where we were half the time. How 's your own fellow getting on? " As manager, Fran had made it her business to know as much about the staff as possible. She knew that Peggy had two children, both of them trials. A grown daughter, who did n't get on with the father, and a youngster, Jerry, who would n't open a book. " Well, apparently, he 's much improved. All the teachers said so. " " That 's good news. " " Yes, and it 's all thanks to this woman we have living with us. Not a word to anyone, Miss Clarke, but we have a lodger, half Italian, half Irish. Says she was married to an Italian and he died, but that 's not true at all. I think she 's a nun in disguise. But anyway, did n't she take an interest in Jerry? She has him a changed lad it would appear. " Peggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that poetry was meant to mean something until Signora came to the house, and this had made all the difference. His English teacher was delighted with him. And Jerry had n't understood that history really happened, and now he did, and that had made all the difference. Fran thought sadly that her own sister had not realized that Latin was a language people once spoke. Perhaps this Signora might open doors for her too. " What does she do for a living, your lodger? " she asked. " Oh, you 'd need a fleet of detectives to find out. A bit of sewing here, and a bit of work up in a hospital, I believe. But she 's going to be teaching an Italian class next term, and she 's high as a kite over it, singing little Italian songs. She 's spending the whole summer getting ready for it. Nicest woman that ever wore shoe leather, but off-the-wall, I tell you, off-the-wall. " Fran decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course. She and Kathy would go every Tuesday and Thursday. They 'd learn Italian, and they 'd enjoy it, with this madwoman who was singing songs and getting ready so excitedly. It might make Kathy relax a bit, and for herself, it might help her to forget Ken, who had gone to America without her. " THEY SAID KATHY WAS A GREAT GIRL, " Fran said proudly at the kitchen table. Her mother, despondent over some heavy losses, tried to show enthusiasm. " Well, why would n't they? She is a great girl. " " They did n't say anything bad about me? " Kathy asked. " No, they did n't. They said it was a pleasure to teach you. So now! " " I 'd like to have been there, child, " their father said, " it 's just that I did n't think I 'd get off in time. " Kathy and Fran forgave him. It did n't matter now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kathy, " Fran announced. " We 're going to learn Italian. Yourself and myself. " If she had suggested they fly to the moon, nothing could have surprised the Clarke family more. Kathy flushed with pleasure. " The two of us? " " Why not? I always fancied going to Italy, and would n't my chances of picking up an Italian fellow be much better if I could speak the language! " " Would I be able to learn it? " " Of course. You 'll probably be top of the class. But it 's meant to be fun. There 's this woman teacher, and she 's going to play us operas and show us pictures, and give us Italian food. It 'll be terrific. " " It 's not very expensive, is it, Fran? " " No, it 's not, and look at the value we 'll get from it, " said Fran, wondering if she was verging on madness herself. DURING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York state. He wrote to Fran : I love you. I will always love you. I do understand about Kathy, but could n't you come here? We could have her out for the holidays, you could teach her then. Please say yes before I get a little flat for myself. Say yes, and we 'll get a little house. She 's 16, Fran. I ca n't wait years for you. Fran wept over the letter, but she could n't leave Kathy. This had been her dream, to see one of the Clarkes get to a university. True, Ken had said wait until their children were born, then they could give them all the chances in the world, but Ken did n't understand. She had invested too much in Kathy, had raised the girl 's hopes. She could n't go now and leave her to her mother, who would look up vaguely from the gambling machines, and her father, who would mean well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few simple comforts he wanted from life. Kathy would drown without her. IT WAS A WARM SUMMER. VISITORS CAME to Ireland in great numbers. The supermarket arranged special take-out picnic lunches. It had been Fran 's idea. It was a terrific success. On her days off, Fran took Kathy on outings. One day, they went on a threehour bus tour of Dublin. " Just so we know about where we live, " Fran had said. " Imagine, we 're the only Irish people on the bus, " Kathy whispered. " The others are all visitors. " Without being too bossy, Fran also organized Kathy into buying some smart cotton dresses, and talked her into getting her hair cut. By the middle of the summer, Kathy was tanned and attractive, and her eyes began to lose their haunted look. Kathy did have friends, Fran noticed, but not close, giggly friends as she had known when she was 16. Some of Kathy 's friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place, Fran knew from the youngsters at work, that was not well run and where, she suspected, drugs circulated. She could n't forbid Kathy to go and make the girl feel like a victim, but she could happen to be passing by at one o'clock in the morning to collect her. She asked Barry, one of the young delivery van drivers at the supermarket, to pick her up and drive past the disco, offering him overtime pay for the job. " I can have you act as an excuse to get my sister home, " she told him. Barry was a great kid, and mad for the overtime since he wanted to buy a motorbike. " And what do you want it for? " Fran asked one night as they waited outside the disco. " For freedom, Miss Clarke, " he said. " You know, all that air rushing past and everything. " Fran felt very old. " My sister and I are going to learn Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's great, Miss Clarke. I 'd like to do that myself. I went to Italy once. I made the greatest friends. " " Maybe you 'll learn Italian too. " She spoke absently. She was watching tough-looking people come out of the disco. Why did Kathy and her friends want to go there? " I might if I have the bike paid for, because one of the first places I 'm going to take it is Italy, " Barry said. " Well, the class is at the Mountainview School. It begins in September. " She spoke in a distracted tone because she had just seen Kathy, Harriet, and their friends come out. She leaned across the seat and hooted the horn. Immediately, the girls looked over. The Saturday night lift home was becoming part of the regular scene. What about the parents of these girls? Fran thought. Did any of them care? Or was she just a fusspot? Lord, it would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. THE ITALIAN CLASSES BEGAN ON A Tuesday at seven o'clock. There had been a letter from Ken that morning. He was settled in his little apartment ; in America, he wrote, a flat did n't mean a flat ; it meant a flat tire. People were very friendly, they invited him to their homes. Soon it would be Labor Day, and they would have a picnic to mark that the summer was over. He missed her. Did she miss him? There were 30 people in the class. Everyone got a huge piece of cardboard to put their names on, but the marvelous woman leading the class said they should be called by the Italian version. So Fran became Francesca, and Kathy, Caterina. Everybody made a great game of shaking hands and exchanging names. Kathy seemed to be enjoying it hugely. It would be worth it in the end, Fran told herself, putting out of her mind the thought of Ken going to Labor Day picnics. " Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Is n't that Barry from your supermarket? " It was indeed. Fran was pleased, the overtime must have been enough for the bike. They waved at each other across the room. What an extraordinary assortment of people. There was that elegant woman, the one who gave lunches at her house and was always in the paper. What on earth could she be doing at a place like this? And the beautiful girl with the golden curls, Elisabetta, and her nice boyfriend in his good suit. And the dark, violent-looking Luigi and the older man called Lorenzo. What an amazing mixture. And Signora was delightful. " I know your landlady, " Fran said to her when they were having little snacks of salami and cheese. " Yes, well, Mrs. Sullivan is a relation, " Signora said nervously. " Of course. " Fran was reassuring. " She said you were very helpful to her son. " Signora 's face broke into a wide smile. She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think she could be a nun. She was sure Peggy Sullivan had gotten it wrong. THEY LOVED THE LESSONS, FRAN AND Kathy. They went together on the bus, laughing like children at their mispronunciations and at the stories Signora told them. There was an extraordinary bond among the people in the class. It was as if they were on a desert island and their only hope of rescue was to learn the language and remember everything they were taught. Possibly because Signora believed that they were all capable of great feats, they began to believe it too. She begged them to use the Italian words for everything. They found themselves saying they had to get back to the casa or that the camera was very warm or that they were stanca instead of tired. And all the time, Signora watched and listened, pleased but not surprised. She had never thought that anyone faced with the Italian language would feel anything but delight and enthusiasm for it. MISS JOSIE HAYES, THE HISTORY TEACHER, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrons of the arts. " Can anyone think of the people that they sponsored? " The children looked at each other blankly. " What are the names of some of the famous artists of Italy, do you know? " Kathy Clarke raised her hand. " One of the most important was Michelangelo. One of the Medicis, Pope Sixtus the fifth, asked Michelangelo to paint the Sistine Chapel. " In a confident voice, she told the class about the scaffolding that was built, the rows and the fallingsout, the problems that there still were in keeping the colors alive. She did n't frown, she showed only enthusiasm, and she went further than Miss Hayes could have expected. " Thank you, Katherine Clarke. Now, can anyone else name another artist of the period? " Kathy 's hand went up again. The teacher looked around, but there were no other takers. The boys and girls looked on, amazed, as Kathy explained about Leonardo da Vinci and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing, maybe because he was lefthanded, or maybe because he wanted them kept secret. Later, in the teachers " lounge, Josie Hayes said : " Those Italian culture classes must be something else. Today, I had Kathy Clarke giving me a rundown of the Renaissance like nobody 's ever heard. " Across the room, Aidan Dunne, who had dreamed up the idea for the Italian classes and enlisted Signora to teach them, stirred his coffee and smiled to himself, a big happy smile. KATHY CLARKE WAS THE YOUNGEST OF Signora 's students, eager to learn, and attractive, too, in a blue-eyed, darkhaired way. Sometimes she saw the girl studying in the library and wondered if she had hopes of a higher education. " What does your mother think you might do when you leave school? " she asked Kathy one evening when they were tidying up the chairs after class. " My mother? " Kathy seemed surprised. " Yes, she seems so eager and enthusiastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she does n't really know much about the school or what I 'm doing. " " But she comes here to the class with you, does n't she? And she goes out to work in the supermarket? Mrs. Sullivan where I stay says she 's the manager. " " Oh, that 's Fran. She 's my sister, " Kathy said. Signora looked puzzled. " I 'm so sorry. I get everything wrong. " " No, it 's an easy mistake. " Kathy was anxious for the older woman not to be embarrassed. " Fran 's the oldest of the family, I 'm the youngest. " Kathy did n't say anything to Fran about it. No point in making Fran go to the mirror to look for lines. Poor Signora was a bit absentminded, and she did get a lot of things wrong. But she was a marvelous teacher. Everyone in the class loved her. THERE WAS A BAD RAINSTORM IN OCtober, and water leaked in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cope with it by moving tables out of the way and finding a bucket in one of the cloakrooms. All the time, they shouted, " Che tempaccio " at each other, and " Che bruto tempo. " Connie, the elegant woman with the expensive jewelry, said she could give Fran and Kathy a lift, and after class, they scrambled into her beautiful BMW. Fran, in front, gave directions. This was not the kind of territory that would be familiar to Connie. When they got to the house, Fran saw her mother putting out the trash, wearing the same scuffed slippers and sloppy housecoat that she wore all the time, a cigarette in her mouth despite the rain. Fran then felt ashamed for feeling ashamed of her mother. Her mother had had a hard life and had been generous and understanding when it was needed. " There 's Mam getting drenched, " Fran said. " Could n't the trash have waited till the morning? " " Che @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go on, Caterina. Your granny 's holding the door open for you, " Connie said. " That 's my mother, " Kathy said. There was so much rain and confusion of banging doors, nobody seemed to take much notice. Inside the house, Mrs. Clarke was looking with surprise at her wet cigarette. " I got drowned waiting for you to come in from that limousine. " " Let 's have a cup of tea, " said Fran, running to the kettle. Kathy sat down suddenly at the kitchen table. " Due tazze di te, " Fran said in her best Italian. " Come on, Kathy. Con latte? Con zucchero? " " You know I do n't take milk and sugar. " Kathy 's voice was remote. She looked very pale. Mrs. Clarke said there was no point in a person staying up if this is all you were to hear, so she was off to her bed. And she was gone, complaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it, Kathy? " Kathy looked at her. " Are you my mother, Fran? " There was silence in the kitchen. They could hear the flushing of the lavatory upstairs and the rain falling outside. " Why do you ask this now? " " I want to know. Are you? " " You know I am, Kathy. " A long silence. " No, I did n't know. Not until just now. " Fran came toward her, reaching out. " Kathy, you knew, you felt it. It did n't need to be said. I thought you knew. " " Does everyone else know? " " What do you mean, everyone else? The people who need to, know. You know how much I love you, how I 'd do everything for you and get you the best that I could. " Kathy shook her head as if to clear it, to take this new and frightening knowledge out of her mind. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How would I have known? We both called Mam and Dad, Mam and Dad. You were my sister. Matt and young Joe and Sean were my brothers. How was I to know? " " Well, it was n't a big thing. We were all together in the house, you were only seven years younger than Joe, it was the natural way to do things. " " Do all the neighbors know? " " Some of them maybe. They 've forgotten, I imagine. " " And who was my father? My real father? " Fran knew she needed more tact and diplomacy than had ever been called on in work, and this was vastly more important. " He was a boy who was at a posh school, and his parents did n't want him to marry me, " she said. " Now, let 's have some tea and talk. I 'll tell you every single thing you want to know. And if Dad comes in in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your room. " She sounded so calm that she stopped Kathy in the slightly hysterical tone she was taking. After she poured the tea into two mugs, Fran sat down, and said : " I have loved you every day of your life, and, honestly, it got blurred whether you were my sister or my daughter. You 're just. Kathy to me, and I want the very best for you. I 've worked hard so I could provide a good living for us. I 've saved a little every week, not much, but enough to start you off well. " Tears came to Kathy 's eyes. Fran reached over and patted the hand that clutched the mug of tea. " Ask me anything. " " What 's his name? " " Paul Malone. " " And how old was he then? " " Sixteen. I was fifteen and a half. " " You loved him? " " Yes, very much indeed. I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and so did he. I wo n't dismiss it and say it was nonsense. It was n't. " " Where did you meet him? " " At a pop concert. We got on so well. I used to sneak out from school to meet him and we 'd go to the pictures. It was a wonderful, happy time. " " And then? " " And then I realized I was pregnant, and Paul told his mother and father, and I told Man and Dad, and all hell broke out. " " Did anyone talk about getting married? " " No, nobody talked about it. I thought about it a lot. I used to dream that one day Paul would come to the door with a bunch of flowers and say that as soon as I was sixteen we would marry. " " But it did n't happen? " " No. " " And why did he not want to stay around and support you even if you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal. His parents said that since this was an unlikely partnership and that there was no future in it, it might be kindest for everyone to cut all ties. That 's what they said. Cut all ties. " " Were they awful? " " I do n't know. I 'd never met them until then, any more than Paul had met Mam and Dad. " " So the deal was that he was to get away with it, father a child, and never see you again. " " They gave four thousand pounds, Kathy. It was a lot of money then. " " They bought you off! " " No, we did n't think it was like that. I put two thousand away for you. It 's grown a lot, as well as what I added myself. The other two thousand went to Mam and Dad because they would be bringing you up. " " And did Paul Malone think that was fair? " " He listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young to be a father, he had a career ahead of him, it was a mistake, he must honor the arrangements that had been made. That 's the way they saw it. " " And did he have a career? " " Yes, he 's an accountant now. And he married and has children, his own family. " " He has other children? " Kathy 's eyes widened. " Two, I believe. " " How do you know? " " There was an article about him in a magazine not long ago-you know, lifestyles of the rich and famous. " " But he 's not famous. " " His wife is. He married Marianne Hayes. " Fran waited to see the effect this would have. " My father is married to one of the richest women in Ireland? " " Yes. " " And he gave a measly four thousand pounds to get rid of me. " " That 's not the point. He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point. He 's rich now, he should give something. " " You have enough, Kathy. We have everything we want. " " No, of course I have n't everything I want, and neither do you, " Kathy said, and suddenly the tears that were waiting came, and she cried and cried, while Fran, who she had thought for 16 years was her sister, stroked her head and her wet cheeks with all the love a mother could give. THE NEXT MORNING AT BREAKFAST, JOE Clarke had a hangover. " Will you get me a can of Coke from the fridge, Kathy? " " You 're nearer to the fridge than I am, " Kathy said. " Are you giving me cheek? " he asked. " No, I 'm just stating a fact. " " Well, no child of mine is going to be stating facts in that tone of voice, " he said, his face flushed with anger. " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coldly. They did n't even look up startled, her grandparents, these people she had thought of as her mother and father. The woman went on reading a magazine and smoking ; the man grumbled : " I 'm as good as any other father you ever had or will have. Go on, child, give me the Coke, now, to save me getting up, will you? " And Kathy realized that they were n't in the business of secrecy or pretending. Like Fran, they had assumed she knew the state of affairs. She looked at Fran standing with a rigid back looking out the window. " All right, Dad, " she said, and got him the can of cola and a glass to pour it into. " There 's a good girl, " he said, smiling at her as he always did. For him, nothing had changed. " WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU DISCOVered you were n't your parents " " I 'd be delighted, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because then I would n't grow up to have an awful chin like mt mother and my grandmother, and I would n't have to listen to Daddy droning on about my grades. " Harriet 's father had great hopes that Harriet would be a doctor. Harriet wanted to own a nightclub. They let the matter drop. " What do know about Marianne Hayes? " Kathy asked later. " She 's like the richest woman in Dublin. And she 's good-looking too. Why are you interested in her? " " I dreamt about her last night, " Kathy said truthfully. " Well, you look awful pale and tired, so do n't dream about her again. It 's not doing you any good. " " No, it 's not, " Kathy agreed, thinking suddenly of Fran with her white face and the lines under her eyes. She thought of Fran saving money every week for her for 16 years. She remembered Fran 's boyfriend Ken going off to America. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Someone who was n't a plumber 's daughter who had dragged herself up to the top in a supermarket, someone who was n't struggling to support an illegitimate child? Ken had known about her. It did n't appear that Fran had gone to any trouble to keep it a secret. As Fran had said last night, there were many households all over Dublin where the youngest child was really a grandchild. And she had said that in many cases the child 's mother had not stayed at home ; the eldest sister had left to start a new life. It was n't fair. It just was n't fair that Paul Malone should have had his pleasure and no responsibility. Three times that day, she was reprimanded in class for not paying attention. But Kathy Clarke had no interest in her studies. She was planning how she should best visit Paul Malone. " TALK TO ME, " FRAN SAID THAT EVENING. " What about? You said there was nothing more to say. " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were anxious. She did n't have expensive creams to take away the lines on her face. She never had anyone to help her bring up a child. Marianne Hayes, now Marianne Malone, must have nurses, nannies, au pairs, chauffeaurs, tennis coaches. Kathy looked at her mother with a level glance. Even though her world had turned upside down, she would n't add to Fran 's trouble. " No, Fran, " she lied. " Nothing 's changed. " IT WAS N'T HARD TO FIND OUT WHERE Paul and Marianne lived. There was something about them in a paper almost every week. Everyone knew of their house. But she did n't want to go and see him at home. She must go to his office, talk to him in a businesslike way. There was no need to involve his wife in what she wanted to say. She began to telephone large accounting firms. On the second call, she 'd found him. She had heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and theater people. Not only did he have all the money, he had all the fun too. Twice she went to his office, twice her courage failed her. The building was enormous. Once in, she could talk to him, tell him who she was, how her mother had worked and saved. She would beg for nothing. She would point out the injustice, that was all. But the place was too impressive. It overawed her, with the doorman in the lobby, and the girls at the information desk who called up to see if you were allowed access to the offices above. She would need to look different to get past these groomed dragons at the desk if she were to meet Paul Malone. They would n't let a schoolgirl up to see a senior accountant, particularly one married to a millionaire. She telephoned Harriet. " Can you bring some posh clothes of your mother 's to school tomorrow? " she asked. " Only if you tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventure. " " A sexual adventure? " " Possibly. " " Do you want a nightie then? " Harriet was very practical. " No, a jacket. And gloves. " " This must be something very kinky altogether, " said Harriet. The next day, the clothes arrived slightly crushed in a canvas bag. Kathy tried them on in the girls " cloakroom. The jacket was fine, but the skirt seemed wrong. " Where 's the adventure? " Harriet was breathless with excitement. " In an office. " " You could hitch up your school skirt. It would look okay. Will he be undressing you or will you be doing it yourself? " " What? Oh, I 'll be doing it. " " That 's all right then. " Together they made Kathy look like someone who might gain access anywhere. She had already taken Fran 's lipstick and eyeshadow. " Do n't put it all on now, " Harriet warned. " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that. " " I 'm not going to class. You have to say I have the flu. " " But where are you going at nine o'clock in the morning? " " To the office to have the adventure, " Kathy said. " You are something else. " Harriet 's mouth was round in admiration. THIS TIME SHE DID N'T FALTER. " Good morning. Mr. Paul Malone, please. " " And the name? " " Please say it is Katherine Clarke, here about the matter of Frances Clarke, a client from a long time ago. " Kathy felt that this was an office where people had full names. " I 'll speak to his secretary. Mr. Malone does n't see anyone without an appointment. " " You may tell her that I will wait until he 's free. " Kathy spoke with a quiet intensity that was far more effective than her attempt to dress for the part. One of the receptionists seemed to shrug slightly at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Miss Clarke, would you care to speak to Mr. Malone 's secretary? " she said eventually. " Certainly. " Kathy walked forward, hoping that her skirt would not fall suddenly. " My name is Penny. Can I help you? " " Have you been given the relevant names? " Kathy said. How wonderful that she remembered the word relevant. It was a great word, it covered everything. " Well, yes.. but that is not the point. " " I think it is. Please mention the names to Mr. Malone, and please tell him that I will wait here until he can see me. " " We do n't make appointments like this. " " Please give him the names. " Kathy felt almost dizzy with excitement. She waited politely for three more minutes, then there was a buzz. " Mr. Malone 's secretary will meet you on the sixth floor, " said one of the dragons at the desk. " Thank you, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going into the lift that would take her to meet her father. " Miss Clarke? " Penny was like someone from a beauty contest. She wore a cream-colored suit and high-heeled black shoes. Around her neck, she wore a thick, black necklace. Kathy wished she was better-looking, older, and better dressed. " Come this way, please. Mr. Malone will see you in the conference room. Coffee? " " That would be very nice, thank you. " She was shown into a room with a pale wood table and eight chairs around it. There were paintings on the wall and fresh flowers on the windowsill. She sat and waited. In he came, handsome, youngerlooking than Fran. " Hallo, " he said, with a big smile. " Hallo, " she said. There was a silence. Then Penny arrived with the coffee. " Thanks, Pen, " he said. When she 'd left, Kathy said, " Do you know who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " Were you expecting me? " " Not for two or three more years, to be honest. " His grin was attractive. " And what would you have done then? " " What I 'll do now-listen.... " It was a clever thing to say, he was leaving it all to her. " Well, I just wanted to come and see you, " she said a little uncertainly. " To know what you looked like. " " And now you do. " He was warm and welcoming. " What do you think? " " You look fine, " she said reluctantly. " And so do you, very fine, " he said. " I only just found out, " she explained. " That 's why I had to come.? " I see. " He had poured them coffee and left her to add milk and sugar if she wished. " Until this week, I honestly thought I was Mam and Dad 's daughter. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fran did n't tell you that she was your mother? " " No, she did n't. She thought I understood, but I did n't. I thought she was just a marvelous older sister. I was n't too bright, you see. " " You look fine and bright to me. " He seemed genuinely to admire her. " I 'm not. I 'm a hard worker, but I do n't have quick leaps of understanding, not like my friend Harriet. I 'm a plodder. " " So am I as it happens. You take after your father then. " It was an extraordinary moment. He was admitting he was her father. She felt light-headed, with no idea where to go now. She thought he would have blustered, and denied things, and excused himself. " You would n't have a job like this if you were just a plodder, " she said. " My wife is very wealthy, and I am a charming plodder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day, Katherine. You 'll like her, she 's a very nice woman. " " It 's Kathy, and I am sure she is very nice, but she would n't want to meet me. " " Yes, if I tell her I would like it. We do things to please each other. " " But she does n't know I exist. " " Yes, she does. I told her a long time ago that I had a daughter. " " You did n't know my name? " " No. When all the business happened, Fran said she would just tell me if it was a girl or a boy, that was all. " " That was the deal? " Kathy said. " You put it very well. That was the deal. " " She thinks you were great in all this. " " And what message does she send me? " he was very relaxed, gentle. " She has no idea I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? " " At the Mountainview School. There is n't much money out of four thousand pounds sixteen years ago to send me to a posh place, " Kathy said with spirit. " So you know about the deal? " " I heard about it all at the same time, in one night. I realized she was not my sister and that you had sold me. " " Is that how she put it? " " No. It 's how it is. She puts it differently. " " I 'm very sorry. It must have been a bad, bleak thing to hear. " Kathy looked at him. That 's exactly what it had been : bleak. She had thought about the unfairness of the deal. Her mother was poor, and could be paid off. Her father was the son of privileged people and did n't have to pay for his fun. It had made her think the system was always loaded against people like her, and always would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was. It is. " " Well, tell me what you want now, " he said. " Tell me, and we can talk about it. " She had been going to demand everything under the sun for Fran and for herself. But it was n't possible to say this to the man who sat easily across the table, giving every impression of being pleased to see her. " I 'm not sure what I want. It 's all a bit soon. " " I know. You have n't had time to work out how you feel yet. " He did n't look like a man who 'd been let off the hook. He sounded sympathetic. " Are n't you annoyed I came? " " No, I 'm delighted you came. I 'm only sorry that life was hard up to now, and then it got worse with this shock. " She felt a lump in her throat. He could n't have been more different from what she had imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been married and she would be their eldest girl. He took out a business card and wrote on it. " This is my direct line and my home number. You can call me anytime. " " What about your wife? " " Marianne will be happy to speak to you, too, of course. I shall tell her tonight that you came to see me. " " You 're very cool, are n't you? " Kathy said with a mixture of admiration and resentment. " I 'm calm, I suppose, on the exterior, but inside I 'm very excited. Who would n't be? To meet a handsome, grown-up daughter for the first time and to realize that it was because of me you came into the world. " " And do you ever think of my mother? " " I thought of her for awhile, as we all think of our first love, and more than that because of what happened and because you had been born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things and other people. " It was the truth ; Kathy could n't deny that. " What will I call you? " she asked suddenly. " You call Fran, Fran. Ca n't you call me Paul? " " I 'll come and see you again, Paul, " she said, standing up to leave. " Anytime you want me, I 'll be here Kathy, " said her father. They each put out a hand, but when they touched, he drew her to him and hugged her. " It will be different from now on, Kathy, " he said. " Different and better. " AS SHE RODE BACK TO SCHOOL ON A bus, Kathy rubbed off her lipstick and eyeshadow. She rolled up Harriet 's mother 's jacket into the canvas bag and went to rejoin the classes. " Well? " demanded Harriet. " Nothing happened. " " You mean you took all that gear and went to his office, and he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " Kathy said. " I expect he 's impotent, " Harriet said sagely. " In the magazines, you always read about that sort of thing. There seems to be a lot of it about. " " It could be, I suppose, " said Kathy, and took out her geography book. The teacher looked at her over his half glasses. " Your flu better all of a sudden, Kathy? " he asked suspiciously. " Yes, thank God, sir, " Kathy said. She was n't rude or defiant, but she spoke to him as an equal not a pupil. That child has come a long way since the beginning of term, he said to himself. He wondered if it had anything to do with the Italian classes, which by some miracle had proved not to be the total disaster he had predicted. MAM HAD GONE TO BINGO. DAD WAS AT the pub. Fran was at home in the kitchen. " You 're a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure. I took a walk. I learned all the parts of the body for class tonight. You know Signora is going to put us into pairs and ask, Dov'e il gomito, and you have to touch your partner 's elbow. " Fran was pleased to see her happy. " Shall I make us a toasted sandwich to give us energy for all this? " " Great. Do you know the Italian word for feet? " " I piedi. I studied at lunchtime. " Fran grinned. " We 're going to be teacher 's pets, you and I. " " I went to see him today, " Kathy said. " Who? " " Paul Malone. " Fran sat down. " You 're not serious. " " He was very nice. He gave me his card. Look, he gave me his direct line and his home number. " " I do n't think it was a wise thing to do, " Fran said eventually. " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he was glad I came. " " He did? " " Yes. And he said I could come anytime and go to his house and meet his wife if I wanted to. " Fran 's face seemed empty suddenly, as if the life had gone out of it, as if someone had put a hand into her head and switched something off. Kathy was puzzled. " Well, are n't you pleased? There was no scene. He understood that it had all been a bit of a shock, and he said from now on it would be different. Different and better, those were his words. " Fran nodded and got out the words, " Yes, that 's good. " " Why are n't you glad? I thought this is what you 'd like. " " You have every right to get in touch with him and to be part of all he has. I never meant to deny you that. " " It is n't a question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. You 're right to feel shortchanged when you see a man like that who has everything. " " That 's not what I was looking for- " Kathy began. " And then you come back to a house like this, and go to a school like Mountainview, and you 're meant to think that going to some evening class that I scrimp and save for is a treat. No wonder you hope things are going to be.. what is it, different and better? " Kathy looked at her in horror. Fran thought she wanted Paul Malone instead of her. That she had been dazzled by a momentary meeting with a man she had not heard of until a few days ago. " It 's only better because now I know everything. Nothing else will change, " she tried to explain. " Of course. " Fran was clipped and tight now. She was spreading cheese on the bread, with two slices of tomato each, and putting it under the grill as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want any of that. Listen. Do n't you understand? I had to see him. You were right, he 's not a monster, he 's nice. " " I 'm glad I told you. " " But you 've got it wrong. It 's not that I want to be with him rather than you. It 's only just to see him the odd time. That 's all. Why do n't you call him, talk to him on the phone, then you 'll understand. " " No. " " Why not? " " Sixteen years ago, I made a bargain. The deal was that I would not contact him again, and I never did. " " But I did n't make that deal. " " No, and am I criticizing you? I said you had every right. Is n't that what I said? " Fran served them cheese on toast and poured two glasses of milk. Kathy felt inexpressibly sad, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making sure that she 'd had everything she needed. There would have been no pints of cold milk at the ready, no hot suppers cooked if it were not for Fran. Now she had even let slip that she had scrimped and saved for the Italian classes. No wonder she was hurt at the thought that Kathy might, after all this sacrifice, be prepared to forget the years of love and commitment, that she would be blinded by the unaccustomed thought of access to real wealth. " We should go now for the bus, " Kathy said. " Sure, if you want to. " " Of course, I want to. " " Right then. " Fran put on a coat that had seen better days. She changed into her good shoes, which were n't all that good. Kathy remembered the soft leather shoes that her father wore. She knew that they were very expensive. " Avanti, " she said. And they ran for the bus. AT THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, menacing frown seemed somehow more sinister than ever tonight. " Dov'e il cuore? " Luigi asked. His Dublin accent made it hard to know what he was talking about. " II cuore, " said Luigi again, annoyed. Fran looked at him vaguely. " Non so, " she said. " Of course you know where your bloody cuore is. " Luigi was getting more unpleasant by the moment. Signora stepped in to make peace. She lifted Fran 's hand and put it on her heart. " Ecco il cuore. " " It took you long enough to find it, " Luigi grumbled. Signora looked at Fran. She was quite different tonight. Normally she was part of everything and encouraging Kathy to participate as well. Signora had checked with Peggy Sullivan. " Did n't you tell me that Miss Clarke was the mother of the sixteenyear-old girl? " she asked. " Yes, she had her when she was only that age herself. Her mam brought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, it 's well-known. " Signora realized that it had not been known to Kathy. But they were both different this week. Perhaps it was known now. Guiltily, she hoped she had played no part in it. KATHY WAITED A WEEK BEFORE SHE called Paul Malone on his direct line. " Is this a good time to talk? " she asked. " I have someone with me at the moment, but I do want to speak, so please hold a moment. " She heard him getting rid of someone, an important person maybe, a wellknown personality, for all she knew. " Kathy? " His voice was warm and welcoming. " Did you mean it that we could meet somewhere sometime, not rushed like in the office? " " Of course, I meant it. Will you have lunch with me? " " Thank you, when? " " Tomorrow. Do you know Quentin 's? " " I know where it is. " " Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? " " I 'll make it fit in with school. " She was grinning, and she felt him smile too. " Sure, but I do n't want you getting into trouble. " " No, I 'll be fine. " " I 'm glad you rang, " he said. THE NEXT MORNING, SHE WASHED HER hair and dressed with care in her best school blouse. " You 're meeting him today, " Fran said as she watched Kathy polish her shoes. " I 've always said you should have been in Interpol, " Kathy said. " No, you 've never said that. " " It 's just for lunch. " " I told you, it 's your right if you want to. Where are you going? " " Quentin 's. " She had to tell the truth. Fran would have to know sooner or later. She wished he had n't picked somewhere quite as posh. Fran managed to find the words of encouragement. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of it. " KATHY REALIZED HOW LITTLE PART IN their lives Mam and Dad seemed to play these days ; they were just there in the background. Had it always been like that and she just had n't noticed? She gave the excuse at school that she had a dentist 's appointment and no one questioned her. It had paid off to have been a hardworking pupil all those years. She was not one of the school troublemakers. She could get away with anything now. Naturally, she told Harriet that she was skipping classes. " Where are you going this time? " " To lunch at Quentin 's, " Kathy said proudly. Harriet 's jaw fell open. " You are joking? " " Not a bit. I 'll bring you back the menu this afternoon. " " You have the most exciting life of anyone I ever met, " Harriet said in envy. THE RESTAURANT WAS DARK, COOL, AND elegant. A good-looking woman in a dark suit came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm Brenda Brennan. Are you meeting somebody? " Kathy wished she could be like this, she wished Fran could-confident and assured. Maybe it was something you had to be born to. Still, you could pretend to be confident. " I 'm meeting Mr. Paul Malone. " " Let me show you to Mr. Malone 's table. A drink while you 're waiting? " Kathy ordered a diet Coke. It came in a crystal glass with ice and slices of lemon. She must remember every moment of it for Harriet. He came in, nodding to people at this table, smiling at that. A man stood to shake his hand. By the time he got to her, he had greeted half the place. " You look different, lovely, " he said. " Well, I 'm not wearing my friend 's mother 's jacket and a ton of makeup to get past reception. " She laughed. " Should we order quickly? Do you have to rush back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, it can take ages. Do you have to rush back? " " No, not at all. " They got the menus, and Brenda Brennan came to explain the dishes of the day. " We have a nice insalata di mare, " she began. " Gamberi, calamari? " Kathy asked before she could stop herself. Only last night, in class, they had been covering all the seafood. Gamberi : prawns ; calamari : squid. Both Paul and Brenda Brennan looked at her in surprise-and admiration... or maybe she was just getting bigheaded. Paul had his usual, which was a glass of wine mixed with mineral water. " You did n't have to bring me somewhere as smart as this, " she said. " I 'm proud of you. I wanted to show you off. " " Well, it 's just that Fran thinks... I suppose she 's jealous that I can go somewhere like this with you. " " She 'd understand. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " She says it 's my right, and she said I was to enjoy it all, but I think in her heart she 's upset. " " Does she have anyone else? " he asked. Kathy looked up in surprise. " What I 'm trying to say... it 's none of my business, but I hope she has. I 'd hoped she would have married and given you sisters and brothers. But if you do n't want to tell me, then do n't, because as I say, I do n't have any right to ask. " " There was Ken. " " And was it serious? " " I do n't know. But they went out a lot, and she used to laugh when he came to the house to collect her. " " And where is he now? " " He went to America, " Kathy said. " Was she sorry, do you think? " " I do n't know. He writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Could she have gone? " " It 's funny you should say that... she asked me once if I 'd like to live in a small town in America. And I said no, give me Dublin any day, at least it 's a capital city. " " Do you think she did n't go with Ken because of you? " " Perhaps that could have had something to do with it. " She looked troubled now, and guilty. " Stop worrying about it. If it 's anyone 's fault, it 's mine. " He had read her thoughts. " I asked her to ring you, but she wo n't. " " Did she give a reason? " " She said because of the deal. " " She was always straight as a die, " he said. " So it looks as if you two will never talk. " " We 'll never walk into the sunset together, that 's for sure, because we 're both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may love Ken. But we will talk. I 'll see to that. Now, you and I are going to have lunch, as well as solve the problems of the world. " They talked of school, show business, the marvelous Italian classes, and his two children, who were 6 and 7. As he paid the bill, the woman at the register looked at Kathy with interest. " Excuse me, but is that a Mountainview blazer you 're wearing? " Kathy looked guilty. " I recognize it because my husband teaches there, " the woman continued. " Aidan Dunne. " " Oh, Mr. Dunne 's very nice. He teaches Latin, and he set up the Italian classes, " she told Paul. " And your name? " the woman asked. " Will be forever a mystery. Girls who take time off for lunch do n't want tales brought back to their teachers. " Paul Malone 's smile was charming, but his voice was steely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much interest. She just hoped that Ms. Brennan had n't overheard. " DO N'T TELL ME ABOUT IT. " HARRIET yawned. " You had oysters and caviar. " " No. I had lamb. Mr. Dunne 's wife was at the cash register, and she recognized my blazer. " " Now you 're done for, " said Harriet with a smirk. " No. I did n't tell her who I was. " " She 'll know. You 'll be caught. " " Stop saying that. You do n't want me to be caught. You want me to go on having these adventures. " " Kathy Clarke, if I had been burned at the stake, I 'd have said you were the last person on earth to have adventures. " " That 's the way it goes, " said Kathy cheerfully. " PERSONAL CALL FOR MISS CLARKE ON line three, " announced the loudspeaker. Fran looked up in surprise. She moved into the surveillance room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen. She pressed the button for line three. " Miss Clarke. " " Paul Malone, " said the voice. She became very still. " Yes? " " I 'd love to talk. I do n't suppose you 'd like to meet? " " You 're right, Paul. No bitterness, just no point. " " It 's about Kathy. She 's hugely important to me, but... " " But you do n't want to get too involved, " Fran finished for him. " Absolutely wrong. I would love to get as involved as I can, but you brought her up, you made her what she is, you are the person who cares for her most in the world. I do n't want to muscle in suddenly. I want you to tell me what would be best for her. " " Do you think I know? How could I? I want everything in the world for her, but I ca n't get it. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give it to her. " " She thinks the world of you, Fran. " " She 's pretty taken with you too. " " She 's only known me a week. She 's known you all her life. " " Do n't break her heart, Paul. She 's a great girl, and she 's had a shock. I thought she knew, guessed, absorbed it or something. It 's not such an unusual situation around here. " " No, but she 's coped with it. She 's got your genes. " " Yours, too, and lots of courage. " " So what will we do, Fran? " " We have to leave it to her. " " She can have as much of me as she wants, but I promise you, I wo n't try to take her away from you. " " I know. " There was a silence. " And are things... well, all right? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She tells me you 're both learning Italian. She spoke Italian in the restaurant today. " " Good for her. " Fran sounded pleased. " Did n't we do well in a way, Fran? " " We sure did, " she said, and hung up before she burst into tears. " WHAT ARE CARCIOFI, SIGNORA? " Kathy asked in a private moment at the end of the class. " Artichokes, Caterina. Why do you ask? " " I went to a restaurant and they had them on the menu. Oh, by the way, Signora, you know how you thought Fran was my mother, but I said she was my sister? " " Yes...? " Signora was ready to apologize. " You were right. I had n't understood. But now I do. " " Well, it 's good to have it all sorted out. " " I think it is good, " Kathy said. " It must be. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nice, and you 'll have her around for years, much longer than if she were an older mother. " " Yes, but I wish she 'd get married. Then I would n't feel so responsible for her. " " She may in time. " " But I think she missed her chance. He went to America. I think she stayed because of me. " " You could write to him, " said Signora. " PAUL? " " Kathy, it 's been ages. " Will you have lunch with me, my treat? Not Quentin 's. " " Sure, where do you suggest? " " I won a prize in my Italian class, a voucher for lunch for two, including wine, at a little Italian restaurant. " " I ca n't have you missing any more school. " " Well, I was going to suggest Saturday, unless that 's a problem. " " It 's never a problem, I told you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over all her other classmates. Paul said he was very pleased to have been chosen as her guest. " I want to put something to you, " she said. " It 's got to do with money, but it 's not begging. " " Put it to me, " he said. She told him about the flight to New York for Christmas. Ken could pay for most of it, but he did n't have it all, and he could n't borrow from anyone in America. " Tell me about it, " said Paul Malone, the accountant. " I wrote to Ken and told him that I knew about everything now, and I was sorry if I had stood in his way with Fran. He was so pleased. He wrote back and said that he loved Fran, and he had been thinking of coming back to Ireland for her, but he felt he would mess things up all ways if he did that. Honestly, Paul, I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you 'd love it, you really would, you 'd be pleased for Fran. " " I know I would. " " So, I 'll tell you exactly how much it is. Three hundred pounds. know that 's enormous. But I know that much and more is in an account Fran has for me. So, you see, it 's only a loan. When we get them together, I 'll ask her for the money, and then I can give it straight back to you. " " I 'd give you anything, Kathy, and your mother, too, but you ca n't take away people 's pride. How would we give it so that it does n't look the way it is? " " Could n't we just send it to Ken? " " I think that would be taking away his pride. " There was a silence. The waiter came to ask if they were enjoying the meal. " Benissimo, " Kathy said. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a voucher she won in her Italian class, " Paul said. " You must be clever, " said the waiter. " No, I 'm just good at winning things, " Kathy said. Paul looked as if an idea had just struck him. " That 's it! You could win a couple of air tickets, " he suggested. " How could I do that? " " Well, you won two lunches here. " " That 's because Signora organized the contest in class. " " Well, maybe I could organize it that someone could win a round-trip air ticket. " " And should we tell Ken? " " I do n't think so, " said Paul. " What do you think? " "! do n't think he has any need to know the whole scenario, " Kathy said. It was a phrase Harriet used a lot. And this is the perfect occasion for it, she thought happily. It was true, what Paul had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go on being that way-for her and for Fran.
