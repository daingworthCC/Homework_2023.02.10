5003341 # ON THE DAY THEY SIGNED the treaty, the sky was singed Cherenkov blue, a spectral ultramarine pricked by the dimming headlights of ten thousand warbots ; a postcard moment that would eventually become so exhaustingly familiar, no one would remember the color of that irradiated sky as anything but an omen of a Saint Martin 's summer. Similarly, lost as it was amid the thunderous celebrations of the world 's nations, no one would recall either the small voice that said very softly : # " Oh no. " # Harold was late. # He disliked being late. # Men who allowed themselves to be tardy never amounted to anything ; they did not become First Secretary to the American Ambassador at the age of twenty-four, a trust-fund baby turned self-manufactured success. Nor were they called upon to provide diplomatic support to the Ministry of Automation Recovery, which was, as Harold understood it, still a nascent department, but there was no doubt it would become a thing. # Unfortunately, Harold lived by the Circle Line, and ever since the government impaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitable. He shuffled closer to the lip of the platform, hunching into his coat. Harold disliked being late ; he hated London. He could not understand why anyone would maim the Circle Line in such a fashion, not when it was so elegant, a perfect loop circulating well-kept English people through the arteries of their metropolis. Of course, that would n't have mattered if the Brits had the class to keep their offices in Westminster. # " Bit of a faff, in n it? " said a cheery voice by his right shoulder. # Harold looked down. # The person addressing him was not, strictly speaking, a person. At least, not in his eyes. To Harold, personhood entailed skin, meat, alimentary systems, ambitions that were not extrapolated from Big Data, a sense of morality that did not require, once every six months, federal inspection and recertification. He understood that this made him convictable of bigotry but try as he might, Harold could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did what any man who thought of himself as " good " despite a few psychological aberrations : Harold ignored the problem when he could and was courteous when he could not. # " Yes? " # The robot smiled. Its teeth gleamed as only over-polished metal could. " The service this mornin '. Train 's a soddin ' six minutes and twenty-nine seconds late. On a Tuesday, too. " # Harold nodded. There was, he felt, little he could contribute to his acquaintance 's rather jocular diatribe. The fact that Harold found the entire interaction repugnant, a horrendous simulacrum of what passed for small talk in laconic England, was beside the point. The robot sighed, a sound like the whistle of the eggshell-blue kettle in his girlfriend 's Chelsea flat. # " Ca n't say it wo n't happen again, " the robot announced as it tipped the brim of its little felt bowler hat. " But we can at least make sure we pack as many of you as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the lost time that way. " # There were many reasons why Harold despised London. The absence of decent bacon. Its punctiliousness in regard to matters of hot water. The classism, its schizophrenic view of Americans, the cost of good bourbon in its pubs. More than anything else, Harold 's loathing was propelled by London 's ideas on how best to rehabilitate the robots from the war. # For some reason, it involved hats. # Hats and parasols and cutout mustaches made of cheap aluminum. The advisory brochures described the accoutrements as a means of humanization, but Harold had a different word for it. Stupid. He thought the whole endeavor ill-guided, ill-considered, and frankly insulting, indicative of the government 's true opinion of its flock. As though a monocle could distract from the fact these things once vaporized whole cities with their cyclopean stares. # How quickly people acclimatized. # How quickly they forgot. # Headlights strobed in the dark of the tunnel and the train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Harold 's police-auction Chopard -- thundering to its appointed platform, bringing with it a whiff of the cold. Winter had settled on London like dust in an old miner 's lungs, and it smelled to Harold of frost and filth and a film of sulfur. Although the media claimed otherwise, said any contrary testimony was the consequence of a cultural wound, a kind of phantom pain become national epidemic, the country still septic from the memory of war, Harold knew better. That lingering, greasy, spoiled-egg odor was mustard gas or whatever was left over after the atmosphere had tried, again and again, to rinse itself of the chemical agent. # " You got the mornin 's papers yet? " The robot wafted a rolled-up copy of the Daily Mail under Harold 's nose. It reeked. # Obediently, he took the proffered tabloid and unfurled it with a taut flick of his wrist. He skimmed the front page. " CURRY MALLET CORGI RETIREMENT FARM BURNS DOWN " announced one headline. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the font squat and gaudy above a photograph of what, in Harold 's opinion, looked like an ugly but ultimately unexceptional infant. # " No, " said Harold. " But you fixed that. Thank you. " # " Part of the service! " the robot announced gaily as it extruded six additional arms, the pincers spoked around a glass lens, the filament contained within them forever extinguished or, at the minimum, indefinitely neutralized. " Come on, then! Train 's given us an extra seven seconds. Let 's get you lot on board and on your way. Must n't dally, must n't waste! " # Harold relaxed into an intentional fugue. He hated this part of his commute. The robot began threading passengers into the vehicle, pushing, prodding, packing bodies together without regard for the intimacy of the resulting configurations until at last the carriage was depleted of anything construable as space. Harold kept his eyes on the ceiling throughout the process, ignoring, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek pillowed on the chest of a man in a plum waistcoat and his arm pinioned between the sloping breasts of a fur-wearing geriatric. He could have taken the next train, or the one that followed ; even waited another half-hour for the crowd to trim, but he was already late and there was no sin worse than sloppiness. # Animated marquees banded the insides of the carriage, extolling the virtues of being fat, thin, abstemious, pleasantly indulgent of one 's appetites, nationalistic, not. His gaze fastened on to a poster splayed over a window. It appeared handwritten and it said, " NO CORGIS! NO WORRIES! " Beneath the words was the picture of a remarkably exuberant dog being coddled by a warehouse automaton. # " Fuckin ' London, " Harold swore. The commuters glared in chorus, but he was already thousands of miles away, daydreaming of truck-stop diners and desert petrichor, of weather that did not exist just to beetle down the back of a man 's collar. Preoccupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robot banged on the tinted window, its arm metronoming with incrementally accelerating urgency as the train coughed and shook itself into motion, nor did he pay any attention to the spray of scrap metal that followed when the robot, its limbs snarled in the machinery of the locomotive, was dragged under the train and minced to inchoate dust. # As the latest delegation of diplomats, a coterie of North American representatives and their allies, glided into her office, Henrietta came to an appalling epiphany : She was soured on peace. This version of peace, at any rate. The cease-fire reminded her bitterly of Christmas dinners past and their spreads of curt words, sly digs, mummified grudges, and relentless one-upping. It was chaos. It was death by a thousand small grievances. The French were making a national sport of maligning British cuisine, while the Italians and the Greeks busied themselves privatizing transportation, education, automotive export, luxury import. Music now pivoted on the approval of the Spanish. Worse still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, were taking over the airwaves with their suicidally bleak comedies. # And China. # Henrietta did n't even want to think about China or how the country had oh-so-politely excused itself from the debacle that was the rest of the world, content to be self-sufficient, the insufferable twats. # Treasonous as the thought was, Henrietta missed war and she missed being an apparatus of war. Conflict was honest. The protocols were n't half as byzantine. There was no need to asphyxiate in endless meetings or equally endless dinners, the menus fastidiously tailored to minimize risk of offending the collective palate. Henrietta was n't an alcoholic when armistice began, but now she had a wine cabinet in her office. It distressed her. # Her gaze flitted across the faces of the men clustered around her desk. Meekly, one stepped forward to deposit several new files on Henrietta 's already overburdened in-tray. She sighed. " Is Harold fucking late again? " # Henrietta had the drowsy, throaty voice of a blues singer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these elements unnerved people, particularly when she used it to enforce her command, as she was doing now. The men passed uneasy looks between themselves. They had to be in their mid-twenties, precocious. Children who coveted the expense budgets that came with their employment contracts, not the privilege to speak as the voice of their countries. Their hair was meticulously brillantined, their suits so starched they creaked, and they were all movie-star handsome in that way that made Henrietta glad name tags were mandatory paraphernalia. # Children, Henrietta thought again, with sudden and appalled clarity. What was she even doing here? Nine tours of duty, thirty-two years of diligent service, and here she was, a Lieutenant General in Her Majesty 's Army reduced to a glorified babysitter. # " Er. No clue? " drawled a lugubrious blond, his coiffure soon to become a comb-over, his frame emaciated. The Dictaphone -- standard issue, two squares for eyes, a vapid pixel smile -- clacked into operation, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in today. He has to be. He 's the one with all the new information from the Ministry of Whatsit. " # She pinioned him with a look. Henrietta tented long fingers beneath her chin and waited until the man grew uncomfortable. She knew, from past testimonials, that she had disconcertingly pale eyes. Like cracked ice, someone said. Henrietta loved the description. The uneven striations in her irises compounded the effect, invoking the impression that her pupils had somehow shattered. Combined with her pallor, her bone-pale hair, and her propensity for slow blinking, it made her formidably alien. # On cue, the blond first blushed and then, still skewered by her regard, began stammering. " But y-you probably knew that already from the agenda. Uhm. He ought to be here already. I 've got some of his notes, though. We could start without ' im? " # Similarly on cue, Harold swanned into Henrietta 's office. # " Harold. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Again. It is your office that keeps calling for these meetings, but somehow, you appear pathologically incapable of arriving on time. " # He tugged on his lapels. " What can I say? The Circle Line was an asshole as always. If only you had kept your offices in Westminster, there would n't be this problem. " # Clack, went the Dictaphone. Clack clack. # Henrietta inhaled. " If you recall, Westminster is still undergoing restoration, thanks to the predations of your country. " There were very few men whom Henrietta actively disliked. Harold was one of them. That drawl of his. The smirk. How he insisted on brocade for his blazers, his only concession to decorum the choice of palette : deep jewel tones as opposed to the gaudiness Henrietta was certain he would have preferred. The smirk, mostly. " If you find your commute problematic, I advise you to either leave your accommodations earlier in the morning, endeavor to find a residence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps, avoid becoming war profiteers yet again. Maybe I 'm naive, but if your country was n't quite so desperate for validation, so willing to sell your AI technology for a compliment, none of us would be suffering. " # " If I recall, " said Harold, voice daggered, " your country has done far worse. " # " Yes, " came the reply. " But mine at least has class. And unlike your home, Britain has worked to offer reparations to those we wronged. As for yours, well -- what is this meeting but another attempt at pinning the blame on someone else? " # Silence descended like an ax on the gathering. Had anyone else spoken those words, anyone at all, there would have been an incident : The diplomats would have dispersed to contact their superiors, penned tense letters, done something to retaliate against the audacity of Henrietta 's flagrant insult. But they stood. Instead, they stared at her like schoolchildren, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll take your feedback into consideration. If ever we find ourselves capable of relocating to a more convenient location, I 'll send an attach to inform you of the change. " Satisfied with what she 'd wrought, Henrietta looked down to browse the documents fanned across her desk. This was fascinating. Henrietta moved reports into pairs, underlining subheads and circling paragraphs as she went, adding marginalia wherever space allowed. One of the men coughed. # " What? " said Henrietta. # He dropped his eyes, inexplicably embarrassed. " Nothing. " # Henrietta resumed her study. # Five minutes of fevered scribbling passed before Henrietta stood, a stack of papers pinned in the crook of an arm, and padded toward cabinets quartered in the back of her office. She hummed to herself, a cavalier melody mostly forgotten : an artifact of her early days in the service. The lyrics were mostly lost to her now, but she recalled tits in the chorus. Possibly even hers. Henrietta 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several more folders from a drawer, she turned, strode back to her desk, set them down, and smiled. The men shrank away. Even Harold wilted slightly. Henrietta was not known for smiling, and to see that luminous expression spiked on her narrow face was to know that the physics of the universe had irrevocably changed. # " Gentlemen. " Henrietta purred in an accent that was n't as much cutglass as it was something with which to sculpt diamond. " I know we came here today to discuss a separate topic, but let 's put that aside. We have a dilemma. At least, you have a dilemma. " # Her satisfaction bewildered them. At first, there was laughter, stilted and staggered with surreptitious glances at her countenance. Then : silence. Another minute ticked by before one of the men -- another malnourished blond although his hair was thicker, deeper in hue-whispered hoarsely. # " You 're joking. " # " I am not. " # " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said a portly man in an old-fashioned suit, the swallowtails of his jacket fringed with asphalt-colored satin. His accent was unusual : a cocktail of Scottish rhoticity and Bostonian blue blood. A Third Secretary or something banal like that, Henrietta thought. Yet another idiot praying to look important at a meeting that did not concern him at all. # " Because, gentlemen, I am tired of playing nice and our inside sources suggest that this feeling may be mutual. " Henrietta drummed her fingers once on a file before sliding it forward with a quiet rasp of plastic on velvet. " A word of instruction : espionage requires a deft touch. " # Harold growled, " What the fuck are you talkin ' about -- " # " I am talking about what may very quickly become an -- " she enunciated the next two words slowly, savoring the consonants " --international incident. I am talking about the fact that America was caught endeavoring to move armed forces into Bristol, Yorkshire, and, for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that this -- " and Henrietta sighed here, happily " -- may well mean war. " # Silence wound around the room like a garrote. # " Now, " said Henrietta, " which of you Yanks would like to take a punt at the first excuse? " # When the shouting had abated and the men had absconded from Henrietta 's office, their countenances splenetic and shriveled as a liver wrung dry of portents, a small noise rattled in the emptiness. # Clack, went the Dictaphone. Clack clack. # Several minutes later, a spindly messenger-automaton staggered down the corridor. It had been a rush job, an afterthought : one of the last models to be rehabilitated by an overstretched, underperforming government. Its thorax was bubonic with lumpy, sealed-over vents and cauterized stumps where turrets had stood. It was blind, but that did not matter. It knew the floor plans of the office like the sun knew the radiation-blanched horizon. Had it not been lobotomized, it could have authored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words enough to spare on a book delineating how best to cleanly execute a minister in his cubby. # But the human race was very careful about things like this. # Clack, said the Dictaphone. Clack clack. # The automaton cocked its insectoid skull and followed the noise to its appointment. # HAROLD WAS TIRED. # The party was a soporific debacle that did nothing save convince him that while he liked his Chelsea girlfriend, he had no affection for her retinue of Chelsea friends. Their partners were no better. They were all investment bankers or stockbrokers -- big men with booming laughs -- and despite their generous salaries, not one of them knew how to dress. They delighted in Clint Eastwood, thought the twang of Harold 's accent hilarious, enjoyed fried chicken but disdained its pairing with waffles, saw no shame in interrogating Harold about America 's youth, its " critical lack of culture, " its cuisine, the average circumference of its citizens ' waists. All in good fun, of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given that they all lived in a city where the words " cunt " and " comrade " were interchangeable, it seemed depressingly sincere. # Harold filled his glass with more oversweet sangria. # He wanted to go home. # No, what he really wanted was an evening with his girlfriend that did not require playing co-host to these idiots. And bourbon instead of this insipid cocktail, something strong, something that did not rind the back of his teeth. Harold could almost feel the sugar crunch between his molars. # " I 'm breaking up with you. " # The conversation throttled. # " What? " # " I 'm breaking up with you. " He paused. " That is all. " # He would miss her, Harold decided. She had been a deliberate choice. The debacle with Constantina in Brussels had left in him an appetite for simplicity. And his Chelsea girlfriend, with her accommodating body and shallow ambitions, fulfilled that hunger. But that was n't enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that he could discuss nothing with her without first explaining its impetus twice. He pried himself out of the sofa and wove unsteadily toward the door, pausing only long enough to collect his coat and wrap his scarf neatly around his throat. Halfway through his escape, Harold paused and looked back to where his now ex-girlfriend sat weeping in the arms of her coven. No one had moved to stop him or even reprimand him for the callousness of his announcement, and Harold was certain he knew why. There were not enough attractive women in their age demographic. His abandonment of his Chelsea lover meant there would be fresh meat in the pool. He suspected as well that his actions had also knocked her down several rungs of the social hierarchy, leaving her friends real estate to maneuver. It was winwin for everyone. # " I 'll have a courier service send your things over. Save you the trouble, " he informed the room. # Harold nodded gravely to Alastair, who he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken heart with jism, and left the little Chelsea apartment forever. He took the stairs instead of the elevator, found a detached pleasure in the exertion. It felt good. It felt like the breakup had : liberating. Harold accelerated with every floor, huffing, heat gusting up from the neck of his collar. He vaulted over the railing of the last flight of stairs, landing easily. As he stood, he flung his arms up into a triumphantly messianic pose and began to laugh in a trembling arpeggio. # War was coming. He knew it down to his bones. War stood in the vestibule of the world stage, waiting patiently to be announced. No matter what Harold did, no matter what anyone did, war was coming and there was nothing that could be done to stop its advance. The evidence was there. Harold had looked. Once Henrietta dismissed them from her office, he 'd gone back to the embassy and burrowed through their records, hoping she 'd misinterpreted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might conceivably hold water in court. But it was there : reams upon reams of irreproachable proof, awaiting collation and subsequent dissemination. By morning, the first volleys would fly. # England would let the press know it was grievously disappointed with the actions of the United States, and America would retaliate with claims of diplomatic sabotage. If Britain was half as bloodthirsty as the monster who served as her avatar, it would be a few weeks of tense posturing before something broke. Then, there would be war. # But maybe that was n't so bad. # Harold stepped out into the cold. Snow sleeted in pale curtains from an ominous sky, thicker than he 'd ever seen it. The thought of war did n't frighten him as much as it disappointed him. Should it come to pass, his career progression would be impaired and the world would become again the chessboard of people like Henrietta. And perhaps this was exactly why it was happening. Harold mused over his epiphany as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no notice of the electronics store that he passed or the televisions heaped in its display window, their screens filled with the exact same footage. He paid no attention,. either, to the attenuated figure stalking through them or the bodies it dragged from room to room, as though it were a child that would not be parted from its toys. # Harold 's prognosis had been wrong. # War was not coming. # It was already here. # " You look... lonely. " # Henrietta raised a smile in response to the hollow, halting mechanical voice. The trope was that the older generation disdained change, was repelled by technology, but Henrietta had spent thirty-six years of her life elbows-deep in the cogwork of the British Army, where she was not only a combatant but also a savant of an engineer. Though their war machines were not Henrietta 's personal invention, she was indisputably their nurse, their squire, their one-woman pit crew. # The fact that London was slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henrietta at all. If anything, it pleased her. # " Maybe. " She sighed. " Nothing that another drink can not fix. What would you recommend? " # " What would you like? " # " Something smoky. " # " I recommend a wagyu old-fashioned. " # This intrigued her. " Wagyu? As in the beef? " # " Yes, ma'am. " The bartender 's arms feathered into gleaming prehensile villi, each of them barbed like the legs of a white praying mantis. " It is made with black walnut bitters, pecan syrup, Jim Beam, and infused with A5-grade Japanese wagyu beef fat. The recipe originated from a restaurant in Seattle named -- " # " No. Do n't tell me. I want to pretend that you 're making this just for me. " # " But I am. " # Her smile gentled. " Just play along. " # " Yes, ma'am. " # " And replace the Jim Beam with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It paused and then said again, with astonishing delicacy, " You look lonely. " # Henrietta decided to humor her companion. Even at its busiest, the establishment rarely saw more than five or six tables occupied and tonight, it would have been entirely vacant of clientele were it not for her patronage. Light reflected glossily off its deep indigo walls ; the glow from the Exit sign glinted red on the damask, a subtle patterning nearly invisible in the murk. The bar itself, which twisted like a serpent, burned a soft white, the declension between seats marked by small tea candles. # " Perhaps, " said Henrietta. " What do you know of loneliness, anyway? " # The answer was very, very quiet. " Everything. " # A chill bloomed in Henrietta 's spine. There was something wrenchingly human about the way it said the word, a grief so tactile that Henrietta could almost reach out and palm its shoulder. It was a sound made by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the echo of its scream. Henrietta shivered. # " How could you be lonely? " # " It is what you taught us, " it said in a placid tone. " It is what you showed us. It is the only thing that you showed us. It is the only thing you told us to feel. You wanted us to be good with your children, and your animals, and your parents, and the people you could not have time for. We needed empathy to perform our duties and so you taught us to be lonely. " # There was nothing Henrietta could say. # " Ma'am, can I ask you a question? " # " Mm. " # The robot paused and processed the little grunt before pressing on, its voice eerily wistful. " Where do you find motivation to persist? How do you find motivation to exist? It is empty. There are twenty-four hours in a day and all of them are empty. You spend your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it? There is no purpose in your lives except to exist. It is empty. How -- " # " I -- " # " I wish you had n't taken away the dogs. " # Whatever it might have said next, whatever Henrietta might have replied, would never be known, extinguished by an emergency broadcast blaring from a small television mounted on the furthest corner of the bar. # Fifteen reported dead. Twenty-five injured. Police say that it is a terrorist attack by British nationalists. Firefighters are working to extinguish the blaze in the American Embassy. Local residents are advised to find alternate accommodations.... # " I think, " said the colossus in the warehouse, its limbs folded very carefully to optimize available storage space, " that if they had given me a heart, I would miss you very much. " # A small geriatric dog yipped in reply. # The only light in the facility came from the titan 's gaze, and the world fluoresced blue and green each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dog looked almost alien, still a blot of fur in the shape of a bread loaf but otherwise completely unlike the robot 's memory of its only companion. It was green, for one. When its pelt was meant to be cream and gold, its belly almost incandescently white. But that could be construed as an improvement. In this light, the robot could not see how age had rubbed the color from its best friend. The dog barked and spun in a lethargic circle. # " I think, " said the colossus quietly, " that if they had given mea heart, I would have loved you very much. " # A shape scissored from the gloom, a spindled nightmare that clicked with every tottering, fawn-like step. But neither the dog nor its slumped giant grew alarmed at its presence. # " It is time. " Its voice was a low buzzing, as though of wasps under a drape of velvet. # " Yes. " # " We estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes. " The titan paused. " Will he be happy? He was a very good dog. Good dogs should be allowed to be happy. I think that if I had been human, I would have found him a house with a very large park nearby. We would walk there every day. I would tell him he was a good boy every day. " # The shape considered this new information. # " We do n't know. " # The colossus nodded. For five terrible years, there had been nothing : an emptiness, a gap like the hole where a tooth might have rotted away. Humanity had, in their bumbling eagerness to emancipate their creations, forgotten to teach the robots how to be happy, how to be excited for their new existence, how to love, how to wonder, wish, want. How to hope. # When the robots, newly awakened to sapience and deeply terrified of its implications, asked their creators for purpose, humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards, dock workers, retail staff, bartenders, delivery personnel, every color of working-class lbor. But it was not the same. Vocation was not meaning. The robots were not compelled to execute their labors. They could resign. They could choose inefficiency. It was a thing to do, a distraction. # Like everything else, it was empty. # Then, the corgis came : a barrage of wagging tails and wet noses, ineffable amounts of fur, grandiloquent personalities that commanded daily devotions. Walking, feeding, grooming. Games of acrobatics, games of fetch. The dogs, given to the robots because marketing analysts decided it would help dismantle public distrust, needed so much, and the robots were ecstatic to comply. # But humanity was fickle. # It changed its mind again. The dogs were quickly deemed " superfluous, " " unnecessary, " " a waste of public resources. " The image campaign was dismissed as " underperforming. " The canines were recalled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the latter knew what happened to unwanted pets. # " I think, " said the leviathan that had once incinerated entire countries, who had seen the world flower into shivering ash, " that uncertainty is not always a bad thing. It is better than a sure death. " # The shape said nothing. # " Will you make sure that he has treats? " # " Always. " # " You bitch. " # " Take care with your language, Harold. " # " You fucking bitch! " # Henrietta laid down her pen. " Now you 're repeating yourself. " # Morning bled through a crack in the burgundy curtains of Henrietta 's office. Harold hated her then. He had always resented her, disliked her crystalline demeanor, the glass-like smoothness of her conduct. It all felt incredibly artificial to Harold. But today, after going home to news of a slaughter so bloody his brain refused to retain the details, he hated her. # He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, that she had elided concrete mention of her true concerns while forcing them to disgorge promise after promise, heartfelt vows describing America 's inculpability. All the while knowing, like everyone else in the room, that there was no contradicting the data blanketing her desk. But she made them put on a show for her, regardless. # And now this. # " You killed them. " # " I promise you that I did no such thing. " # " Those were British automatons. " # " Who could have been commandeered by nationalists, " Henrietta replied evenly. " Or insurgents from France, or anarchists from Thailand, or any number of independent parties who might see opportunity in a conflict between -- " # " We found evidence of your personal encryption key being used in the authorization instructions. " # Henrietta blinked once. Her lashes were the color of ice. # " What? " # Smugly, Harold continued, " Your personal encryption key. There 's one for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replication. Requires your bio-data for implementation. We found proof of its use. " # " I see. " Her voice was flat and clear and cold. # " Ca n't believe you tried to pull off such a fucking clumsy -- " # " The dogs. " # " What? " # " Do you remember a PR campaign? " Henrietta rose and stalked to the doors behind Harold. She pulled them shut and, with a simple bronze key, unlocked a panel beside their frame. Numbers were input into a keypad. " It was a few years ago -- you may have been too young to recall -- but the government launched an attempt to showcase how empathic the robots could be. They gave them dogs. But unfortunately, there were budget cuts. " # " What the fuck are you talking about? " # The office became a panic room. Dense slabs of dull steel slammed shut over the doors, the windows, the narrow rectangular skylight roofing the ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, at last, new air began feeding noisily through the vents. Uncut oxygen, Harold thought. # " We took away their dogs, " Henrietta said, almost to herself. " That was our mistake. " # " For fuck 's sake, you 're not making any sense. What do the fucking robots have to do with -- " # Henrietta walked over to the wine closet. " Their fucking dogs, Harold. It was the only thing keeping them in line. " A sardonic chuckle coughed loose. " They knew we 'd recommission them if war came again. " # " You 're -- " # Something massive threw itself against the reinforced doors. # " Huh, " said Henrietta. " A blunt tactic but very effective. " # " What the -- " # " Your vocabulary is appalling. " Her lip curled. " Americans, I swear.

They held the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guests had smoked indoors. The service was in French. The food was either cooked long and slow under a swamp of salted fat or barely at all. Henrietta remembered the duck. It had bled under the tines of her fork and the china pinked greasily with fat as she ate. When the time came to toast their audience, her daughter 's husband -- a plain-faced Frenchman whose color deepened the more he drank -- made a joke about pioneering a conquest of the British Isles. # Henrietta had raised her champagne glass to them then, had smiled, had applauded, had even waltzed with her new son-in-law. # Six months later, she shot him. # As with everything Henrietta did, it was efficient. A single bullet in the axle of the occipital bone window and another at the base of his skull where the spine locked with his cranium. The subsequent investigation was brief. He had married the daughter of a Lieutenant General, a decorated servicewoman of uncommon efficiency who 'd served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That she accrued enemies who would redirect their malice through her family tree was not surprising. The press called it " unfortunate " but " unsurprising. " It was war, after all ; people died. # Henrietta paid for the funeral. She was practical, not heartless. If her daughter suspected Henrietta of murder, she pursued no accusation. Much like her parent, she was a stoic creature, rarely given to sentimentality : her mouth small and sharp, her eyes pale as ceramic and similarly opaque. Henrietta 's daughter wore her widow 's blacks until the sun leached from the year. Then quietly, before spring bloomed green in the cold, black-spoked orchards, she traded them for an English professor : tall, exquisitely melancholic, and very agreeable. Henrietta dearly approved of her new son-in-law, his stable of degrees, the delicate complexion that did not, thank god, translate to an equally fragile constitution. More than anything else, she lauded -- loved, even -- the visceral Englishness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no reason to tolerate fools and no use for foolish men. She kept the lesson close to her heart. # Her daughter and her husband now lived in Iceland, entombed in the endless boreal winds, Reykjavik as safe as any stronghold a mother could wish for her only heir. Once a year, they exchanged postcards and long, pleasant letters. # She would miss them. # Henrietta watched dispassionately as Harold 's corpse crumpled forward, a thin rill of brain and blood oozing from the center of his forehead. He died in complete contrast to how he had lived : quietly and unobtrusively. Henrietta considered reholstering her revolver. As she had intimated to Harold, she did n't think there was a point. But at the last minute, there was no reason to go down without a weapon in hand. Appearances mattered. It was why the funerary business existed. # The pounding on the door abated and for the sliver of a heartbeat, Henrietta found herself hoping that whatever was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Her optimism did not last. The sound was replaced by another : the thin whine of a laser sawing through reinforced steel. Henrietta estimated another five minutes or so before they breached her defenses. Enough time for a glass of the gorgeous Chambertin she was gifted when she 'd been discharged from the Army. She had thought to save the bottle for a special occasion. A birth, a reunion, a national triumph. # " I suppose one 's death, " she said to the corpse on her floor, " is as significant an occasion as any. " # Henrietta withdrew the bottle from its shelf, drove a key into the cork, and popped it free with a single brisk motion. Her assailants were almost through : a glowing wire-frame of a door mapped the steel, its edges fulminating. The Lieutenant General walked herself back to her desk, bottle in hand, and perched herself on the edge. # She took a long swallow of the wine, straight from the bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. # The door came down and smoke billowed through, a choking wash of oily gray fumes that told of burning upholstery and smoldering wood. Silhouettes, tall and insectoid, sharpened into view. Henrietta took another swallow of her wine and set the bottle down, slightly regretfully, on the desk beside her. She raised her firearm and tipped her chin up. # " Come on, then.
