4163041 The conversation they were having was about Dannie 's recent pregnancy. How to plan at once for a birth and a funeral. Her friend pushed the double stroller and, at ten o'clock, the day had ah-eady become threatening. Recently, Dannie had met a woman named Mrs. White. This in itself was not remarkable, but the woman 's first name was Rose. She was an old woman, thrice-over a widow, and she worked in a shop selhng jeweled hatpins in the shape of bumblebees, scallop-shell treasure chests, tiny shvers of the original cross suspended in a ruby tear and all sorts of other charms. The shop was owned by Mrs. White 's friend, another Mrs. White whose first name was Lily. Dannie was very taken with this story. In it she heard something like a prophecy, though her friend 's name was Sylvia and they had n't known each other very long. They had gone around the block several times already. Their houses sat side by side in the middle of the island. Two miles in one direction was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and the neighborhood went downhill very quickly. On their walks, they tumed left four times : once at the redbrick Baptist church, again at the house with new copper guttering, third time at the bungalow with bed sheets for curtains and lastly at Sylvia 's house, her garden newly planted with pansies, her eaves in need of paint. They came to the comer and started again up the hill. Dannie considered her own house. Sylvia 's house 's twin, but freshly painted -- an innersanctum pink, she liked to think of it, while Sylvia 's house was garish, a squawking green. On Dannie 's porch was her wooden swing, her red table. Also two plastic baby swings, side by side, so her babies could dangle their fat legs above the rhododendrons. Truly, she had been through it! " You tell me what you would have done, " she said to Sylvia. " Is it possible not to be ironic in that situation? " But Sylvia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being watched, a man sitting on the porch of the blue Federalist house which had been sectioned into apartments, smoking a cigarette. Oh, he was harmless enough. What was his name? Steven? But it changed the way Sylvia thought of herself on this walk, changed the way she listened. She was aware of her bun, greasy and too tight. She was aware of how wide her friend 's buttock had become, rolling extravagantly under her black yoga pants, and the way no one would think, though she tightened her grip on the stroller, what she was pushing around was her own. " I am a stork, " thought Sylvia, but it was unclear even to herself if she was referring to her playground nickname or referencing the myth of conception her mother had insisted on during Sylvia 's puberty and retumed to with an almost religious fervor in the facili100 WESTERN HUMANITIES REVIEW SARAH BLACKMAN ty they had picked out together during the early years of her mother 's decline. Dannie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had been to the bedding shop. She had just replaced her bedding and there was something complicated about the pillows, a color scheme she could n't get right. She needed a visual aid, and then there she was, bawling in the parking lot, in her sixth month and already big as a house, as she liked to say. Dannie thought of her house, all the rooms freshly painted, the long cool hallways and the speckles of paint she still had to sand off the floorboards and would sand as soon as she could find the time. Also the underside of the windowsills to paint, the blinds to dust and straighten, a loose washer on the kitchen faucet, a strange smell wafting up the drain in the tub. A house is as bad as a baby, she liked to say. Maybe as bad as two babies, which brought her back to the point. Really, Sylvia slunk along. A front wheel of the stroller was tuming blindly, rattling over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little kick to straighten things out. " I mean what? " Dannie said. " Even just picking the flowers. Camations? Baby's-breath? " They had reached the top of the hill and paused for a moment at the foot of the church steps, directly across from the blue house. This was perhaps the highest hill on the island and they could see the bay glimmering in the distance. It seemed very flat and dark, a clouded, blind sort of blue. Sylvia knew the bay 's ecological function and was familiar with its shallows rife with urchin and sea-grasses, but it was hard just now to think of the bay as any kind of shelter. Its half-moon seemed a sickle rather than a hom. On the porch, the man -- Robert? John? -- lit another cigarette and leaned forward to grind out the first butt in the mouth of a ceramic planter shaped like a fish. He had an almost perfectly round head and his hands too seemed round, as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumb and the littlest finger a geometrically perfect circle. Because of his round head, his features had an uneasy relationship with one another. From a certain angle, Sylvia had always thought him quite attractive, but then he would tum or the light would change and his jaw would be revealed as weak, his eyebrows confused, his upper lip short and petulant, soft and pursed as if he were puckering for a facetious kiss. A wind was blowing steadily at their backs. This was the second time Dannie had kicked the stroller, jolting the whole contraption to its side wheels, and Sylvia did not know why she was now laughing. At least it was n't a hot day, though it had seemed like it was heading that way when Sylvia got up that moming. Another ash-white day is what it looked like they were getting, but now the sky had darkened, ratcheting everything down a few degrees, and the tops of the tall pines were starting to toss back and SARAH BLACKMAN forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look queer -- patio furniture, a lawnmower, a half-empty bag of potting soil -- and she supposed it also made her look queer, accentuating her angles and shadows. A marabou stork, perhaps, with a mottled scalp and cruel, opportunistic beak. Dirty, clanking feathers. Sylvia looked over to her friend, her neighbor really, but Dannie seemed consumed with her story, showing Sylvia with her hands just how big the big pillows were and how small were the small ones. Steven, she had decided to call him for convenience ' sake, had come down off the porch and was poking around in the shrubbery next to his driveway, a stinking tangle of sumac and poke-weed. For a moment, Sylvia felt the urge to call out to him, wam him against the poke which was poisonous and would stain his shoes if he snapped one of the thick, purple stalks. Then she imagined how she would seem to him, peering at him with her bossy eyes which, when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Far away behind them came a rumbling that could have been thunder or someone 's truck gearing down to take a hill. Mrs. White had been sitting in a lawn chair outside the shop smoking a cigarette. She was using a conch shell for an ashtray and her hair was piled on top of her head in an elaborate fashion that required much underpinning, struts and braces clearly visible through her thin yellow-gray curls. She had a wide mouth, pulled down slightly to the left, and she brought the cigarette to that lax side so the smoke poured out and spilled over her chin without volition or direction. It was like looking at a dragon armored entirely in pearls. Mrs. White was wearing a tee-shirt which said Palm Springs in fading pink script and featured a jungle-green palm tree accentuated at all its points with clusters of rhinestones, but this did nothing to diminish what Dannie had immediately identified as her native gravity. A practical sort of obtuseness which surrounded her as she looked past Dannie -- lowing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedding-store clerk had drawn for her and her great looming belly casting its own shadow like a miniature planet, for god 's sake -- and pretended to be watching the traffic pass on the causeway. At the time, this had seemed a kind of challenge to Dannie, though she conceded this was true of most situations at that stage due to hormones and worry, the worry worse even than the hormones which were, after all, natural. She had risen to it the way she rose to all challenges. Every one of them that had come her way since she was sixteen years old, just a baby really, and her life somehow seemed to slip out of gear. " I marched right over to her, " Dannie said, halting the procession to adjust the stroller 's sunshade against the suddenly slanting light. " I let her know what was going on right in front of her, but which she had refused to recognize due to her own sufferings, which were apparent, but are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dannie loved this part of the story. She replayed it in her mind some nights while trying to fall asleep against the hum of the baby monitor, the neighbor-up-the-street 's husky yodeling moumfully at the end of his chain and the palms in Sylvia 's side yard clacking their hollow, gray fronds together like two immense, desiccated birds shifting their weight. Clack Clack Clack, all night. Softly, she conceded, but with great purport right outside her window as if reminding her they were still there, older than her, had been there first, rooted their whole life in exactly that soil. Another challenge! She knew the world by now ; it could n't fool her. Dannie pictured her face as she told Mrs. White about her condition, the real-life drama, the human passion of it, and she pictured it proud : her neck drawn back, cheeks highly colored, nostrils flared and quivering with the extremity of her emotion. Of course, there had been no mirror and the window of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to catch the image of herself. Mrs. White, in any event, had reacted only by blinking, her eyes delightfully out of sync so the effect was something like watching an alligator at the nature park decide whether or not it is going to submerge. She had gestured toward the lawn chair next to her. " Well, sit down, " she had said, and then, " Poor creature, " shaking her hand toward the chair, her many bracelets jangling, her rings catching a dull light behind each of her swollen knuckles. " You said all that? " said Sylvia, but she still could not make herself fully listen. Steven was walking down the street behind them. Out for a stroll, hands in his pockets, stopping now and then to admire the survivors of someone 's late-season lilies, proud heads bobbing high above all their decapitated neighbors, or to tie over and over again his shoe. Only, he seemed to keep the distance between them exactly. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guttering and turned left, Steven also reached the house and tumed left, his footsteps heavy and measured and surely a little over-loud, deliberately over-loud, behind them. Sylvia tried to focus on other things. The guttering, for example, was starting to weather, taking on an oily sheen, and she tried to remember when exactly it had been new. Was it even this year? But the image had no location, no real limits. There it was, the flash of the copper against the maroon brick, and there again were her thoughts on first seeing it : how much it must have cost/clearly, the wife did n't work, home all day, her idea/one hoped it would n't be stolen, copper so expensive now, people in the neighborhood just wandering through, looking for what they could get. It came back to her in that particularly synchronous way private thoughts are remembered. Her body too, how she had felt and the angle of her vision, but none of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quality of the light. Just herself and the copper guttering, the copper guttering, herself, herself, the guttering --SARAH BLACKMAN It was sickening how everything in her head repeated. Really, it was enough to make her sick, woozy as the street sloped sharply downward and she braced herself against the stroller 's pull. For a moment, she imagined just letting go, the stroller rocketing crazily down the hill like a scene from some funny movie. A comedy about women, but still starring Steven who would sprint out ahead of them and save the day. They stopped so Dannie could pull the sunshade back again and behind them Steven also stopped. They started and she heard his shoe scrape against the sidewalk. It did n't matter, it did n't matter. The house with the copper guttering was large, but the family had too many children. Sylvia had never been able to get an accurate count. The children were all around the same age, but looked very different ; one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towheads, a little girl with the raw, buff face of mental retardation. They came and went, some piling into the wife 's van while others played in the backyard or sat on the front porch steps pushing clacking wooden toys. Perhaps she ran some kind of center, but the backyard as they glimpsed it through the wrought-iron fence was filled with a sort of simple clutter that seemed very private to Sylvia. Many of the border stones demarcating the flower beds were tumed sideways and boards were nailed haphazardly to the elm tree to form crooked, unsteady-looking rungs. Toys had been left to lie where they 'd been dropped, beaks or truck beds agape, and there was a dog, some tall, sleek breed which thrust its head between the bars and sniffed them with a uninterested, liver-colored nose. The dog sniffed at Steven, too. It did n't matter. It seemed no one but the dog was home. Before them, the sky had massed into a heaving dusky purple shot through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, buming clouds of summer had descended and streamed now over their heads, fleet and mean, weirdly bright as they whipped toward the bay. Sylvia imagined what the ocean must look like beneath that coming storm. She imagined it had risen to the occasion, was itself heaving, hysterical, impressionable. In the end, it was the ocean that would do the most damage to the island. A slow erosion of the land and the things that had been made of the land ; the piers and shops and pavilions, the fountains and rickety crab shacks, the houses with their sandy curbsides and carefully banked garden soil. Her mother had always said the ocean was like a little sister -- foolish and easily led, but once it got going, boy, look out! Her mother said the ocean had something to prove, but Sylvia was an only child and as far as she knew her mother was also an only child. They had lived alone together all of Sylvia 's young life in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island was so narrow there that in her bed at night Sylvia could hear both the impassioned tossing of the ocean 's waves and the more circumspect murmuring of the bay. In the season, the oyster rakes passed back and forth over the beds just beyond her window. It SARAH BLACKMAN had not been idyllic. There was no air-conditioning and the sump pump yielded up a steady trickle of gritty, brackish water from around the foundation, but to Sylvia it had been very real and so constant she remembered every surface and angle of the house in a still, clear, inviolate light as if it had never been visited by her own experiences. As if it were a place wholly independent of her, enduring, to which the fact of herself was incidental and easily overlooked. The house was no longer there. The whole area had been leveled to make way for a Palmetto Bank and a parking lot, a Build-Your-Own Burrito restaurant with a flashy lanai, complete with taxidermied parrots and cane benches cemented into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her childhood that still stood was a corrugated-steel warehouse which had housed in its time an auto-body shop, construction materials and then sand dredged from the deep ocean rifts to replenish the beaches after storm. The occasional fiddler crab would stray from the bay 's mudflats and set up a territory in those artificial dunes, loiter in the cracked hangar doors with its swollen, beUigerent claw drawn up before its eyes. Now the warehouse was a church called the First Holiness Spiritual Center in Christ, but it endured regardless. As did the bay, of course. And the ocean. Steven stumbled over something. Sylvia heard him swear under his breath, closer than she had thought. " Let 's cut through the alley, " Dannie said. " It looks like it 's going to rain. " After her encounter with the first Mrs. White, Dannie had gone back to the store frequently. The season was changing, but in such a begrudging fashion she found it difficult to mark the time, and already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so large her size seemed a condition of her being. Like a blimp, she thought, but not in any old way. Not in the way the pregnancy guide books had encouraged her to figure -- full like a fruit, or a pod from which would be squeezed perfectly identical peas -- but rather full like a hovering disaster filled with swirling miasmic gasses, waiting for the spark. She explained herself in this way to Mrs. White who nodded and produced a string of tiny, bone beads, each carved into a rudimentary face, dug-out hollows for the eyes, slashed mouths partially open. " Lover 's chain, " said Mrs. White and pooled the Uttle heads in Dannie 's hand. " I know what you mean, " Dannie had said. " I have never been one to shy away from the truth. " Oh, it had been, she now realized, some kind of salad days. All around the island, the jessamine had been blooming and falling off, blooming again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard them as she went, rustling through the dropped bells, shushing in the brittle drifts discarded by the plant 's swelling seeds. She and the Mrs. Whites sat in the front window SARAH BLACKMAN beneath the air-conditioning vent and watched cars sweep back and forth on the causeway like water bugs. Occasionally a truck would pass and they could see the bridge dip and sway below its weight, bob for long minutes afterward in a kind of gracile indecision. " How many, do you think, if the bridge collapsed ' Dannie would ask. " How many if it happened right now? " And the Mrs. Whites would laugh, one following the other, descending notes spilling creakily out to the corners of the crowded room. She and the Mrs. Whites sifted through the store 's objects. An inventory of unusual shells, carved doodads, glass balls into which were blown smaller glass balls and inside those bubbles, pinpoints of emptiness which caught the light. Everything was covered with a thin layer of dust, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. She and the Mrs. Whites picked out fabrics from the store 's back room. Sateen, pink polka-dotted organdy, a slick of water-shot silk that could be pinned and twisted into bunting, a romantic little spill of lace. It was going to be a party. She and the Mrs. Whites planned to drink mint lemonade and eat finger foods. Red sausages wrapped in pastry dough, a blonde pudding studded with figs. They would wear dresses, little ankle socks. She imagined the Mrs. Whites footling around in the sandy loam in their ankle socks, a stiff frill of lace cupping their ankle bones, tasteful plastic plates of cake they could gesture with, should they so choose, toward the dais or the horizon, the little box cushioned in flowers and fabrics, the bridge flanked by its attendant gulls dipping and bowing in the evening light. Perhaps there would be an exigency planned for nightfall. Tiki torches, a fire pit. Why not braziers placed at thoughtful intervals along the path back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lapping against the stones all the way down the crooked hill. Like the sound of the bay lapping. Little waters, nothing really. An eddy, a shallow. Leftovers. The storm already passed safely out to sea. And then she had the babies. Then she had both of her babies. Both of her babies had then been bom. Sylvia did not understand why they were still talking about this. It had been months and the babies were fine. A boy and a girl, both sleeping in the stroller and healthy-seeming if small, their sharp faces screwed up against the fitful light. There had been something wrong with the boy 's legs. They had curved in a strange way, the feet coming together below his torso like another set of hands, the way she imagined a baby monkey 's feet would bend to clasp. Sylvia had found this charming and the baby boy did not seem bothered by it. In their earliest days, Dannie had invited Sylvia to the house to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crib, and the boy had kicked off his blankets and clapped his strange feet together. The look SARAH BLACKMAN on his face made Sylvia feel he was threatening her somehow, giving her a glimpse of his proud, severe future, but he was an infant -- only a few weeks old -- and she knew his face bore no indication of his nascent emotions. Still, Sylvia liked the baby boy. Even now that his legs were encased in braces, the soft bones being bent straight, she preferred him to his sister who was plump and creamy, her joints banded with rosy folds of skin. The girl yawned prettily in the stroller, her mouth as neat as a cat 's, and when she pressed her lips back together and tucked her soft chin against her neck, Sylvia thought she could see some shade of the girl 's adulthood cross her face, some shadow even of her old womanhood. The crepe neck wrinkling into her collar, the sweetheart chin soft as a dumpling. She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vulnerable, soft and tempting. Sometimes Dannie would call Sylvia over and have her hold one or the other of the babies to keep them occupied while she attended to some task of the house. " Just bounce her a little, " Dannie would say. " She likes it when you blow on her head. " But Sylvia was discomfited by the girl child. She found herself constantly fighting the urge to pinch her on the inside of her elbows or the backs of her knees, to take the tiny fold of her ear between her lips and, very gently, bite. It was different with the boy. She respected him. She supposed she felt deferential to him and to what she inferred were his clear preferences. Peas, for example, over pears. The flash of the keys on Dannie 's keychain over the sandy cush-cush of the white-noise machine. Both of the babies ' eyes had darkened, but the girl 's had become a sort of mossy green while the boy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gray striated by navy. Like clouds, Sylvia thought, like these clouds lowering now over their heads as they tumed down the alley. Like the lid of a bucket levering shut. Sylvia thought too much, that was for certain. Her mother had always said this about her with something in her voice both of pride and approbation. In church, her mother said this about her to the other mothers as they gathered around the folding metal table spread with platters of pastel cookies and Styrofoam coffee cups, their rims smeared with equally pastel lip prints. Half-bows of shimmering pink, oyster cream, chill lavender. Sylvia 's own mother had never wom lipstick, and where were the other children? Sylvia scoured her memory for them, but found only her mother in a green serge skirt, her hands thrust into the skirt 's deep pockets, rocking back on her kitten heels. A thinker, her mother had described her to the other mothers, but Sylvia had always thought of herself more as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispers, felt the damp heat of the breeze. She remembered the nap of the carpet in the church basement, a hard industrial nub, and the coarse, split feel of her mother 's knuckles as she reached into her mother 's pocket to take her hand. There was so much all around her. So much always SARAH BLACKMAN going on between the bay and the ocean, the weather, the demands of the seasons one after another, and now her neighbor, Dannie, whose motion lights were too sensitive and struck on at the slightest breeze to shine in her bedroom window, who left the television on for company in her dark house so its blue light gathered and pattered and flashed into the dawn, who thrust her torso over the porch railing and called to her -- " Sylvie! Sylvie! Are you there? " -- to come over, come over, for a minute come over, come with her on another walk around the block. When would there ever be time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if she had been gathering herself for the effort. As if, for a long time, the materials she would need had been washing into her like flotsam caught in an eddy, and soon she would array them all before her, the stuff of her life, and really think about it the way her mother had always assumed she would. What would her life have been? Ladyfinger cookies and paper plates, a lace-embroidered handkerchief, an aquamarine haimet and jet beads hanging in an unraveling fiinge from the flap of a handbag. What would it have been? A loose screen flapping against the window, the pop of ice fracturing in a glass, the rustle of underskirts, nylon thighs, the clack of short heels measuring up and down a hall. What else could it have been? The taste of cream fillings, of powdered cheeses, the bite of grass sucked at its sweet root. The raw-iron oyster of blood, tang of resin rising through new planks. The brine of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All these things, all of them at once. Sylvia did not know if she would be up to the challenge of her life when it came. When any time now it would come to her, brash and demanding. The baby boy made a sound almost like a bark and when Sylvia peered over the sunshade to check on him, she found he had twisted against the strap that held him in place, craned his neck to look up at her. The metal joints of his braces glinted an oily light at his knees and ankles. His bare feet flexed at the end of this armature and looked slightly swollen, tinged purple as if Dannie had cinched the straps too tight across his thighs. It was a shame his legs had lost the ability to gesture, though in the end, she conceded, the braces would make them more useful for walking. And that was what the child 's legs were for, Sylvia told herself. Was that not what a child 's legs should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherry trees tossed their limbs back and forth, streaming together in the wind so it seemed the alley did not empty again into the road, but into a wild green cacophony, a frenzy. Behind her, very close, Sylvia heard Steven clear his throat and thought, looking down into the baby boy 's fierce eyes. Now Now Now Now Now. But even as she thought it, she recognized the question. The wind flattened against them in a huge, coughing pant and it seemed to Sylvia as if their shadows danced around them. Her shadow and Dannie 's shadow, the SARAH BLACKMAN babies ' hydra shadow craning out of their stroller and Steven 's cast before him, so close now it pressed into their own. It was as if the light of the day were a bulb swinging loose from the sky, knocking around crazily, shining onto all sides of them at once. " Now?, " thought Sylvia. " Is it now? now? now? " And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy, of course, the way everyone had said she would be busy. There was the house to keep up, the babies to bed down. An incredible disorder had taken hold of her refrigerator where, in the bottom of the crisper, something had liquefied into a foul sepia slurry. It also held sway in her linen closet where the towels were neither folded, nor rolled, but smashed into wrinkled wads, the hand towels and bath towels tangling together, the babies ' soft swaddling blankets twisting like pastel snakes in and out of the shelves. Soon she would have to go back to work, her leave almost spent, and that would add another layer to her day. The traveling layer. The hurrying layer. Her breasts were hugely swollen, the veins so prominent along their bulging sides it was as if her skin had thinned to isinglass. The smallest thing set them off. A cat yowling in the yard, a particular series of notes played on a record, the call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck as they scoured the blue moming streets, and her breasts ached and leaked. In fact, everything about her leaked. Breast milk darkened the front of her shirts, drool slipped from the side of her mouth as she dropped into an exhausted aftemoon nap, blood and other mucous flux slid in streamers from the still lax muscles of her vagina. It was no different from incontinence, Dannie thought. She was no different from some species of giant, incontinent snail hauling her outlandish, gaudy shell about the house as she picked up a baby, washed a pan, put down a baby, proffered a breast, sipped weak coffee out of a dirty mug, and slicked her airy house with her effluvium. The wet of her trailed in clotted swathes across her floors and fumiture, walls and window glass. Anyone could see it. It was filthy, foul. She was supposed to be emptied now, the loose skin of her stomach doubling the elastic of her waistband as a reminder, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Mucous, useless veins, miUc and blood. One of the babies hiccuped with the preoccupied breathiness that was the precursor to a wail and Dannie reached across Sylvia to joggle the stroller. Movement was supposed to be soothing. Well, they were moving. It seemed to Dannie as if all she did just now was move. Around the block over and over again. Tum left and left and left and left, always with Sylvia, always in this strange season -- a blooming, bruised, sullen summer that had come to the island months and months ago and seemed in no hurry to leave. And now it was going to rain again. And now something was wrong with Sylvia, always something wrong with Sylvia, who stared ahead of them SARAH BLACKMAN down the alley with a fixed, strained expression such as someone might wear if they caught sight of a meteorite, impossibly far but getting closer, bearing down over their head. Dannie looked from Sylvia 's face, down the length of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as usual : The chain-link fences smothered with honeysuckle, leaves glossy in the fervent health of their late season. The skeleton of a neighbor 's greenhouse project, unglassed, open to the fluctuating weather, but stuffed anyway with stands of tomato, small furred fems, pots of herbs left to bloom and seed. Next door, another neighbor had two clever hobby-horses strung from the lowest limbs of a young oak. The horses were made out of repurposed car tires, a glistening, aggressive black, and their red ears, red tongues and round, white, staring eyes were cut from the sort of raw, unforgiving material one might see in a welcome mat. Coarse and designed to scour dirt. Dannie briefly imagined the woman 's children riding them. She could not picture them -- two girls, she thought, maybe redheads -- but she could see the horses flying to the end of their line, choking back, slamming their rugged belhes into the bark. In the storm wind they spun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and swung loose again. A dizzying purposeless movement. Dannie had not been back to see the Mrs. Whites since the babies were born. It seemed a rude disappointment, these two healthy babies in their white cotton onesies, the event they had so looked forward to definitively cancelled, and she felt the least she could do for the old ladies was delay. After all, let 's be practical. How long could they have? The Mrs. Whites so bent they were like swamp roots, wavering from the earth only to tum and dive once again. The Mrs. Whites in their dark, dirty store, barely mobile, cleaved in tum by ocean light as it scythed through their window on the way to the bay. And come to think of it, where was that store exactly? Pregnant, Dannie had navigated as if by tides, a swelling drift pushing her toward the causeway, pulling her back to the little neighborhood, the little house, the little neighbor shut up like a bug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dannie felt a dangerous, unfamiliar volition. It was as if her self, her real self called Dannie, was a skinny, electrified nerve encased in pulpy layers of fat and blood. As if, should the nerve get out of the house, put on pants that buttoned, pack the babies into the complicated struts of their car seats and steer them all out onto a main street, where it went from there could not be predicted. What rules did a nerve have? Did it have any rules, any behavioral stricture other than to feel, to thrum, to buzz? Where would a nerve go if it had all the world in which to foray? How could it ever bring itself to stop? One of the babies made a husky, throttled noise. It was not of their usual repertoire. Not a sound that portended or precluded, and though SARAH BLACKMAN Dannie did not feel alarmed -- she had never been, would never be, a woman bitten along the edges with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her quicken and tum. Her damn breasts again, but no, they were dry, she herself dry, and the wind buffeting her limbs like thick cotton. Dannie leaned over the stroller and looked down at her children. The boy was twisted around in his seat, his forehead wide and smooth, his eyes blue and troubling. They were hers, it occurred to her. He and his sister, every moment of them under her ownership, at least for now. It was a cheering thought. Maybe she would take them to see the Mrs. Whites after all, painting their faces first as if she and the babies had all just swept in from some outdoor event replete with balloons and colorful exhibitions of skill. Just because the crux of the conversation had changed did n't mean it could n't continue, could n't evolve to include the unimagined perils inherent in being the mother of two healthy children. And was n't it the unknown that was supposed to be so enticing? Was n't that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their store to sell? The unknown, the unwanted, disinherited objects given a second welcome on this earth. Dannie imagined depositing each baby in the crooked cradle of a Mrs. White 's lap -- the girl painted up like a beaver, little buck teeth lapping onto her sharp chin, and the boy something else, something the Mrs. Whites would approve of. An insect perhaps, garishly alien, false eyes an evolutionary target on his forehead and his legs already so many-jointed it was no great feat to imagine them twisted back above his head, rubbing out some measuring tune. She imagined the expressions on the old ladies ' alligator faces, their mouths widening like cracks crazing through varnish, their ropy knuckles popping as they bent their hands to grasp. Delightful! These anthropomorphic babes, these little mummers. Curios, apologies, proffered gifts. This is what Dannie was thinking when she recognized the sound behind her as running footsteps only a second before the blow landed at the base of her skull. A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a last lashing fever, as she fell. Sylvia 's mother had believed in many unfashionable ideas. Fortitude and mutability, tenacity and penance.
