1016141 On Saturday mornings, when I was ten and eleven and used to take drawing classes at the Art Museum, I rode the streetcar, the Eden Park line, through the park to get there. More often than not, that was the best part of the day. Not that I minded the drawing classes ; they were enjoyable enough, although I knew even then that, unlike the grandfather who encouraged me in this, I had no genuine talents as an artist, and suspected, as well, that my interest in art, which I managed to sustain for several years after that, was prompted more by a desire to please him than by any aptitude for the work itself. Not, I believe, an ignoble motive, for I loved him dearly and continued to do so even as I grew older and began to perceive the limitations of his own artistry, just as I 'm sure his love for me was never shaken by the crudity of the drawings of lions and horses I regularly laid before him. It is not for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praise them, that we love each other. And it 's surely just as well that I never developed a vocation as an artist, anyway, since in my late thirties a congenital tremor established itself in my hands, controllable enough for day-today life with medication but rather a handicap, even so, for the paintbrush-or for the surgeon 's knife which I was, in fact, forced to lay down at that time. <p> That change, that relinquishing of my life as a surgeon, which was not unlike the change my grandfather himself must have once undergone, did not occasion much resistance or trauma, at least for me, given how far in advance its coming was seen, and how inevitable. There were adjustments to be made, of course, and we made them, my wife and I, my family and I, after our fashion, though I wonder if it was n't the change that readjusted us, rather than anything we actively did on our own. And even more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my grandparents ' lives when my grandfather, in order to take up the financial responsibilities forced upon him by family life, laid down his paints and brushes. <p> I ca n't recall what happened when I packed up my own pencils and charcoal at the end of those classes. I suppose that often my father, who tended to go into the office on Saturday mornings, must have picked me up, though in fact that seems very unlike him, and perhaps I went off with friends, went somewhere else, down to Crosley Field perhaps, to use my Knothole card to get into a Reds game for a quarter, or simply made my way home the same way I 'd gotten there. That 's not important, however : as with so many of our endeavors, it 's not the end that matters most but the getting there. And how I got there was on the streetcar. <p> But I had to earn it, first. Streetcar lines were already becoming increasingly rare in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the busses that could reach more easily into the expanding suburbs and most of the tracks having been ripped up at the end of the previous decade and sold as scrap metal to Japan, from where, as we were often reminded in those days, they were now returning to us in the shape of bombs and bullets. <p> But the Eden Park line still ran, though, being a suburban kid, I could n't just walk out my door and hop on it. No, I had to walk my dozen blocks first, which during the school year -- since they were the same blocks I walked on my way to fifth or sixth grade -- took a certain dedication on a Saturday morning. Then I had to wait on the corner for the downtown bus, tolerate its long ride through boringly familiar suburban territory into the city proper, and there disembark, paper transfer in hand( good for only an hour beyond the time snipped out on its twentyfour-hour clock by the bus driver), @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street to wait for the trolley to come clattering to a stop there. <p> I waited for the one that said Eden Park. No doubt there were others still running then, probably even others that paused at that same island, usually quite abandoned on Saturday mornings, but I knew which one I waited for, knew its noises and smells and the rows of rattan seats where, though I generally had the pick of the place, I always gravitated to the same one at the very back. And I knew the main roads and apartment-lined city streets I still had to put up with, too. <p> And then, abruptly, we were in the park. I never quite knew how we got there, and I still do n't, though in my mind I have a perfectly clear picture of the way the city was laid out then, the park, the main streets, the intersections we must have passed through, and even the way it is now, with much of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interstate. Somewhere, however, without my ever knowing just where or how it happened, we were away from the city streets, no longer riding rough and noisy, caught up in the traffic and bounded by houses and stores and apartment buildings, but suddenly, as if we had passed through a magic doorway into another world, we were running on tracks through a woods, and I remember it as if it were always spring, and the trees were unfurling their leaves even as we swept by, or summer, the forest in full bloom brushing the car itself with the wide-leaved branches of sycamores and even the noise of the trolley muted, as if out of respect for this pastoral world it had entered, and no one there but the silent driver and myself, the quiet car rolling smoothly through the green tunnel of what might as well have been the Brazilian rain forest as a midwestern city, and then a sudden eruption of brightness as it passed out from under the canopy of trees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the park, clattering roughly again for a minute above the few cars and fewer pedestrians far below, then flowing on again as if it were the great Amazon itself, gliding back into the smooth silence of its tree-shrouded channel. <p> Soon, of course, like the noisy, jerky thing it was, it must have come rattling to a stop in front of the museum. I must have climbed down with my pads and pencils and gone around to the side entrance where the classrooms were and put that dreamy journey behind me as I took my place among other young students in front of some simple still life, a squat vase or a few folds of dull, dusty, maroon velvet that had probably been serving the same purpose since my grandfather 's days as an art student there. Though I do n't remember that transition into the world of concrete steps and rambunctious children and the authoritative voice of the instructor, I am not the sort of person to be wholly charmed away from it by nostalgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way I simply turned to the task at hand, I was manifesting something of the same practical instinct that, as I leafed through the drawing books my parents encouraged me with, pulled me more strongly toward the illustrations of animal anatomy, the diagrams of the skeletons of horses or the musculature of dogs, than toward the smooth, sweeping ovoids out of which I was supposed to learn that heads and torsos, whole figures, could be constructed. <p> For me the only smooth, sweeping line that took on any real meaning was the curve of the trolley car track through the woods of Eden Park. Common sense tells me that that lyric segment of the journey must have lasted only a few minutes, five at the very most. And yet that time -- as the woods opened up their welcoming tunnel before me and the trees flowed by, brushing the car like painters themselves with their leaf-dipped branches, and the tracks behind were instantly swallowed up by the dense greenery -- that brief time was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather and the world and, most surprisingly, myself. <p> One steamy summer afternoon during those same years, on the way downtown on some long-forgotten errand, perhaps, after I had been picked up at the end of an art class, my father abruptly turned the car off the main street and into a section of town I was only vaguely aware of, one of the several run-down areas surrounding the city 's center, this the white slum rather than the black one which I knew better from the fact that his own business was located there. He turned down one hot, narrow, filthy street after another, craning his head out the window at intersections, obviously looking for something, while I sat silent, puzzled, probably bored beside him, only dimly aware of the packed streets we passed through, full of Appalachian immigrants in flight from rural to urban poverty, the men in stained undershirts, smoking, silent, the women in flowered print dresses, as gaunt as the men, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children everywhere, barefoot, half-naked, dirty. <p> Finally he stopped, the car only partially pulled in toward the curb, flipped his cigarette out his window, leaned across me to look out the window on my side, and said, " Yep, that 's the place. " <p> The store window we 'd come to a stop still half in the middle of the street in front of was so filthy it was impossible to see through it. Peeling lettering on the window, once gold, read : ART SUPPLIES. I had no idea what we were doing there, in front of this shop so obviously in keeping with its surroundings in its run-down condition, looking as closed as the boarded-up hardware store on one side, as decrepit as the filthy, jumbled window of the drugstore on the other, and yet so obviously out-of-keeping with the neighborhood. No one, surely, painted here. Not even houses, as far as I could see. Nor could I imagine anyone coming here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushes and paper, that had to be on the dirty shelves, in the stained counters, inside. Even the position of the car, still half out in the middle of the street, motor still running, told me we were n't here to shop for supplies. <p> " That 's where your grandfather 's brother lives, " my father said, settling back behind the wheel. <p> It was the first time I knew that my grandfather had a brother. <p> " The artist, " my father said as we pulled away. <p> This object lesson was not lost on me, though I was still naive enough to question, as we drove out of those desperate streets, whether anyone actually lived there. <p> " Upstairs, " I was informed. I was left on my own to picture what life upstairs, in such a place, must be like, though in his taciturn, uninformative way, my father allowed himself to drop other, darker hints : the reasons this man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman he lived with, not wife, and, worst of all, the fact that he was, as my father succinctly put it, " a failure. " <p> My grandfather, as I well knew, was not a failure because he was, at that time, the service manager of the largest Ford agency in town. But that object lesson had not been lost on me either. Though the apartment he and my grandmother lived in was hung throughout with his oils, what my father always boasted of were the murals he had once done inside the theaters and the opera house, and the huge outdoor billboards he had once painted before papering them put an end to that craft. Yes, my grandfather still drew, even painted occasionally, though mostly on request from someone in the family who wanted a special piece for the hallway or den of a new house. And he still sculpted small animals from soft wood, like the model of our black and white cocker spaniel that sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer an artist. There were better, that is, more important, which is to say, more successful things to do. <p> Some years later, when I was fifteen and had pretty well given up my artistic pretensions, such as they were, for the chemistry lab and girls, both of which I had recently discovered, the Balkers, friends of the family, asked my parents if I would do a drawing for them. If it was not a commission I could refuse, given the way my mother put it to me, neither, I knew, was it one I could perform with much success. To my parents and their friends, art might still have seemed like something I did ; to them I was no doubt still little Arnie the artist, however much I was reshaping myself, in my own mind 's eye, into Doctor Arnold Brownstein, battlefield surgeon, much-decorated for saving lives under enemy fire. For them, what I had was a talent that could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a social favor, but for me it was, now, only something I had once done, a skill I had gained some minimal mastery over, never all that much, however greatly I had enjoyed it. The day my mother dropped me off at the Balker 's home, with only my sketch pad and pencils and the Balker 's black maid for company, I knew I was finally being brought face to face not with rumor or family history but, this time, with the thing itself : failure. <p> The thing I was being asked to sketch was itself a disaster. Perched on, dominating, the mantle over the mirrored fireplace in a living room full of puffy new furniture and deep pile rugs, sat a monstrosity out of eighteenth century France by way of contemporary Japan, when Japan still meant cheap, not good, though I am sure there was nothing cheap about the price they paid for it in some elegant decorator 's shop in New York or San Francisco. It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decorator piece and nothing more, quite simply the ugliest thing I had ever seen in anyone 's living room and, moreover, well beyond my meager sketching skills : a ceramic carriage with driver up front and groom behind and four prancing horses, all in bright colors that blended one into the other and flowing lines and sagging edges, and somehow managing, in spite of its brilliant glazes and stylized figures and the forward tilt of horses and carriage and men, to look thick and heavy as it sat there, as if it were weighing down the whole mantle. <p> Sitting there with my sketch pad on my knees, sinking into the overstuffed couch that faced the fireplace, I knew I might just as well be trying to capture the sagging lines and frequently drunken slurs of the Balkers themselves. <p> I did them their drawing of course, after many even faultier attempts, while the maid paused in her chores from time to time to bring me a fresh glass of lemonade and graciously refrained from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mantelpiece. Or was it out of embarrassment? And if so, for me or for that thing I was staring at over there? At any rate, I did it, finally, as one does the things expected by one 's parents, joylessly and probably even a little worse than I was capable of-though, I thought, tearing the final version off my pad and laying it on the mantel next to the thing itself for the Balkers to find when they returned home, reasonably appropriate to the subject. <p> They 'll love it, I told myself, as, hearing my mother honk, I gathered up my drawing supplies and thanked the maid for her battlefield ministrations. And they did. <p> When my grandfather died, I was away at medical school and did not come home for the funeral. Even today, when there is a death in the family, as has been happening often, for the years have lately begun to knock on the doors of our parents ' generation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing how much I loved this grandfather. <p> " You Brownsteins, you never show your feelings, " she 'll say angrily, pushing things around on her desk, on the kitchen table, wherever we happen to be, showing me that she knows how to show her feelings. <p> " Sarah, " I remind her, " alive. " <p> I saw him only the week before. When he was still <p> And I did, though sitting beside his bed in the nursing home, holding his hand, by no means certain that he had recognized me during the brief moment when his eyes had flickered open, I knew he was already a dead man. <p> Anyway, what she means, but ca n't say, is, " In certain ways, as a human being, and as much as I love you, you 're a failure. " <p> Translation : " Look at the things you just accept without so much as blinking. " <p> It runs in the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But the fact is, we have a good life. Between us, Sarah and I bring in an income more than adequate to the family 's many needs. The children have had their orthodenture, will have their college educations ; we have our house, our vacation home, our travels, our retirement funds. A good life. And what I remember thinking, sitting there in the nursing home, holding my grandfather 's frail hand the week before his funeral, watching the head that looked so shrunken on the pillow, the sparse grey hairs, the little quiverings of his lips, was that he, too, had had a good life. <p> It had been barely a year since my grandmother had died, cancer descending on him in the months right after her death as if it had come directly to him from her, as if this end had grown naturally out of the long life they had shared. They had shared it in apartments, mostly, sometimes in expansive flats full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cramped, newer, post-war fourplexes where many of us had to eat on card tables in the living room when the family gathered on holidays. But always, I knew, they shared it with love : love for each other, love for the children and grandchildren, and a love that reflected back to themselves, as well-a thing I never knew better than when I rode that Saturday morning Eden Park trolley car to the art museum-from each and every one of those children and grandchildren. And yet, I also knew, somewhere in that life they shared had come a great disruption. Among the tales of early automobiles, of the Northside home where the children had been born, of trips to long defunct resorts, of the trials and losses of war and depression, it was never mentioned. But I knew it was there : that tremulous moment when failure had been abandoned for success. <p> And I wondered, sitting beside his deathbed, just how they had negotiated that transition. It does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that, leaving failure behind for success, especially given the good life they went on to share, but I know, I know, there had to have been a shifting of reality, of the world as known till then. Things were left behind. There was loss. I think of the brushes and rags, the oils and easels and canvases, the knives and palettes and stretchers and watercolors consigned to back rooms and Sunday afternoons, and I want to know how they did it. <p> I think I am still waiting for some last words from my grandfather. <p> I think he is still showing me that some things you just have to accept. <p> Doctor Brownstein was not a heroic battlefield surgeon, nor was he ever called upon to be one. But he was successful at what he did, which was, mainly, removing tumors of the kind that had deprived him of both his paternal grandparents, and on more than one occasion he had happened to hear, or overhear, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gave him no small pleasure. From time to time it occurred to him that the roots of such artistry as he had must have been nourished in the basic anatomy of his childhood drawing manuals, in the equine skeletal structure and the canine musculature that he had once liked to imagine lurking just beneath the surface of his own clumsy drawings of horses and dogs. But he did n't really believe that. He also liked to think that his surgical accomplishments-the successful removal of a large, malignant abdominal tumor, say-were not diminished by the fact that frequently the patient did not long survive, but he did n't believe that, either. <p> Then, one day, his father sat in his office, waiting to have a small, swollen( and, finally, benign) node on the back of his wrist lanced and drained. <p> " Kaufman could have done this, " said Doctor Brownstein, referring to the old family physician on whom he was happy to know his father still relied. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to see the best man in his field. " <p> It was a minor office procedure. Doctor Brownstein cleansed the area, applied a light local anesthetic, selected the knife. <p> " You 're shaking, " his father pointed out to him. <p> " It 's not every man, " replied Doctor Brownstein in his gentlest office manner, " who faces the awesome responsibility of taking a knife to his own father. " <p> By the end of which statement the wound had been swiftly and precisely lanced, the pus ran clear and free, there was a bit of squeezing to be done to get it all out, yet another cleansing, the antibiotic ointment to be applied, and a small bandage. It was, in effect, all over. <p> Except for the shaking. <p> Which was not, as the neurologist was later to comment in a small attempt to lighten what we both realized was a serious situation, because the father was there, but because, in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the time finally came to say farewell to Doctor Brownstein, it seemed to me that the others around me grieved far more deeply at his demise than I did. My parents could no longer take delight in having their friends at the country club ask them about their son, the doctor, and found themselves instead, as my mother admitted to me, having to accept sympathies that sounded all too much like condolences. My father, when he was n't using his meager understanding of the concept of congenitality to attack my mother 's family, insisted-still insists-that something could be done about it if only I would go to the best man in the field. Not wanting to encourage his persistent dream of resurrecting the dead, I assure him over and over again, and truthfully, that everything possible has been done. <p> Even my own house, for months, bore all the earmarks of an ongoing wake. There was always an excess of food about, coldcuts and cheeses and rye breads, laid out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From somewhere-a resurrected wedding present? I hesitated to ask, for fear of hearing it was on loan from the funeral parlor-a giant sterling coffee urn began to appear daily on the dining room buffet, its glowing red light relentlessly announcing its readiness for such occasions. And people appeared too, friends, neighbors, relatives I only saw at weddings and funerals, mostly in the early evenings but sometimes in the afternoons as well. They fixed themselves drinks and sandwiches and, I could n't help noticing, talked mainly to my wife. <p> Not that they totally ignored me. In fact, there was always some pointed moment when they approached me directly and fixed me with a deep and serious look as if they were trying to discover whether there might be some sign of life left in me yet. I talked with them on cue, joked with them, urged more food and drink on them, but felt all the time as if they were n't really listening to me, as if that solemn look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, as if, in fact, I were indeed the corpse laid out at the wake upon which each guest had to bestow one final, lingering gaze. <p> In the afternoons, drawn by the quantities of available food I presume, my children 's friends began to accompany them home from school as never before. A friend of my youngest son 's approached me one day, sandwich in hand, to tell me how his father, a highly promising pitcher the Reds had made a big trade for only a few seasons back, had suffered such a serious arm injury in his second year with the team that he had had to abandon his pitching career. Now, he said, biting angrily into his sandwich, they were stuck in this crummy town. Now, he said, his father sold insurance and would n't even watch baseball on TV. Crumbs scattered around him. I heard his disdain for the baseball-player dad who was no more, for the insurance-salesman dad he was now forced to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That same evening, after dinner, as we were still sitting at the dining room table, the evil red eye of the coffee urn glaring at me from the buffet opposite, my older daughter broke the silence by asking me, finally, what I was going to do now. <p> " Lay down my sword and shield, " I told her. <p> Which prompted Sarah, later that night, as we were getting into bed, to announce that, seeing how I had embarked on a pattern of retreat from reality in my relations with both family and friends, I was probably in need of therapy. <p> " They do n't treat the dead, " I told her, slipping the straps of her nightgown off her shoulders. <p> " The dead do n't do that, either, " she said. <p> " That, " I said, looking up from nibbling at her breasts, " is precisely my point. The king is dead.... " <p> " No, " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think so. No. <p> What some might perceive as retreat, others might see as progress in a different direction. And getting there, as I reminded Sarah that night -- and as she agreed, though she was thinking about one thing by then and I was thinking about two -- is half the fun. And maybe what we remember most when the journey is over. The journey adjusts you, readjusts you when you need it, if you 'll let it ; otherwise you find yourself in constant conflict with it, discomforted by it, always wishing it were over when in fact it will be, soon enough, and what then? We want something more from it, I hope, than merely souveniers du voyage, though they too have their place, and can, for that matter, even be found in unexpected places. <p> My father comes by for lunch today, as he does once or twice a week now since my mother 's death and his own retirement, and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dining room table, my journal open in front of me -- dismayed, I know, to find me home at all, though of course it 's only because I 'm home that he 's here. The thick, cream-colored tablecloth is pushed back, and the folds it makes against the square crystal vase that Sarah, who loves flowers, has filled this week with pale, delicate alstramaria, remind me of the still life settings from my childhood art classes. For a moment, just before my father enters, I have the sense that if I look down from staring at the flowers, the vase, and the bunched-up tablecloth, I will see a sketch pad in front of me on the table, rather than this notebook. <p> Then he sits down heavily in the chair across from me and says, shaking his head slowly, as always, " Such a shame. You had such a career in front of you. " <p> One behind me, one before me, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before. We 've been having this conversation for years now. This time I say simply, " Have. " <p> " Here? " he says, looking around the dining room in a kind of mock disbelief but also a very real one, for nothing is ever likely to convince him, the successful businessman who went <p> in to his office every working day of his life-which was, until recently, almost every day -- that one can have a real career by working where one lives. <p> " There, " I answer, pointing through the wide archway of the dining room and across the hall to where the open door of my study reveals a desk piled high with books and papers and, yes, drawings. Drawings, yes indeed. And wonderful ones. Not mine, of course, but I am lucky enough these days to be working with one of the finest medical illustrators in the area, and though she is very modest about her own work, and persists in saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrator, " she is, in fact, a real artist, whose work brings out details of nerve and muscle, tendon and vein, that no photograph can reproduce with half the clarity. We are quite a team, she and I, rather much in demand in the textbook field these days, and she has begun to get requests from a number of journals as well, to provide drawings to accompany certain articles. I should hate to lose her because her artwork, her ability to know and to depict precisely what 's needed for each particular illustration, is what redeems my own necessarily prosaic text. <p> My father, meanwhile, is shaking his great head sadly, slowly, at the clutter of this little home office, the depths to which I have fallen from white tile and stainless steel, from the glitter and glamour of the operating room. <p> " Come on, " I say, getting up from the table, patting his shoulder, " I 'll fix us some lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? " he says, less a question than an accusation. <p> " Pop, " I remind him, " I 've always cooked. " It 's true. Once, a decade or so ago, I even took a series of gourmet cooking classes, which mostly gave me a few skills, a more inventive culinary imagination, and the confidence to enjoy the kitchen. The little disability that impairs me for some things in no way interferes with my ability to slice onions or mince garlic, and, as I often tell Sarah when we team up in the kitchen for one of our regular extravaganzas, a slight tremor in the hand is perfect for adding seasonings. <p> " So what do you make? " he asks, rising heavily, my hand still on his shoulder, to accompany me to the many-windowed breakfast room just off the kitchen, where we will sit in the sunshine filtering through the great shagbark hickory in the side yard and eat the barley soup and french bread I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the copper bowl full of apples and pears and bananas that sits in the center of the table between us. <p> What do I make? At first I 'm tempted to say to him, as I follow his slow, unsteady pace toward the kitchen, Everything : pies and cakes, curries and souffles, you name it, I 'll do it, it 's not always a great success but it 's fun trying. But then I realize that that is n't what he means at all, that while I have gone happily rolling along on my own little culinary track, he has turned off somewhere else altogether, not somewhere especially surprising-this is my father, after all-just not where I have been en route to myself. So as we cross the kitchen with its drainboard piled up with the lettuce and tomatoes and peppers and onions I intend to make us a little salad with, I give him an answer that I truly hope will satisfy both of us. <p> " A living, " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> By Alvin Greenberg <p>
