1013241 1. Childs1 <p> Jeffrey Childs steps out of his slippers, bends over and sets them toe-by-toe beside his nightstand, and sits back into bed with his wife. Beneath the blankets a nebula of warmth radiates from Angela 's body. He loves this pneumatic thrill of her heat as he gets into bed. The smell of her blood-hot limbs. Tonight he has scrubbed his teeth several moments longer than usual. He has stood at the sink in his green cotton pajamas, rinsing his mouth with protracted vigor until the mouthwash tingled and burned, watching himself in the mirror-cheeks pulsing, hands at his hips, eyes beginning to water-then spitting with proud relief, his mouth 's dark interior sanitized, tongue touching teeth as smooth as porcelain. <p> Angela Childs is sitting up with two pillows between her spine and the headboard, a hardcover book open across her knees. She wears plastic reading glasses, stiff folding things with half-moon lenses. She bought them recently. This is only the third time Jeffrey 's seen them on her, but they annoy him, especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's partly the cheap look of them, the grotesque way they magnify her blue eyes. But he 's most troubled that Angela needs glasses at all. She is forty-three years old, as he is, and this is just the way the downward slide of middle age begins. <p> He lies down on his side, trying to ignore the glasses, tucks his knees up in the sheets till his legs are brushing hers. That warmth. He looks across the rise of her lap at the bottom edge of the book. When he speaks, he catches the disinfected tang of his breath, deflected from her hip. <p> " How 'd you think it went today? " <p> The question is a point of ritual on these Sunday nights, the initiator of their soft nocturnal conversation after a long day of church and post-church lunch and family time and dinner. Often the conversation resolves into a whispering intimacy in which they turn out the lights and caress one another with dark fingers beneath the sheets. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. He shivers with pleasure. " Very well, " she says. " You made a lot of important points. Janine Howard was sitting in front of me just nodding away the whole time. " <p> " Not sleeping, I hope. " <p> " No! " She claws at his scalp with mock ferocity. " Of course not sleeping. I mean nodding her head. Agreeing with you, silly. " <p> " Well, you never know. They 're so quiet sometimes. " <p> " Because you captivate them, Jeffie. It 's a good thing. " <p> " You think so? " <p> " Of course. During fellowship, Ron Meyer made a point of telling me what a good sermon it was. Came right up to me and said, ' That husband of yours sure can hit the nail on the head. ' " <p> " He did? Ron said that? " <p> " Sure did. You do n't give yourself enough credit. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from above him like this, coupled with that abdominal resonance near his ear. He finds himself afloat in the hypnosis of her comfort. He rides the affirmation, the warm tenor of her voice, the extreme heat of her-rides it clear down into the soft hot waters of arousal. <p> His vocation is an intense, consuming one. Self-doubt is its chief hazard, against which he has very few defenses. When will I finally get a taste of certainty? he wonders-just a taste, just a hint. He stands at the altar each week and looks out over rows and rows of pews filled end to end with people in crisp Sunday garb, hears his microphoned voice flowing over them, bouncing back at him from the rear wall, and all he can do is trust. Trust that he 's shaken a single questioning heart. But his trust is rarely confirmed in any concrete way. <p> Things have been particularly difficult recently. Two months ago Redfield Baptist hosted a visiting evangelist by the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten years younger than Jeffrey, with shoulders the width of double doors and an upper body bursting with stiff protuberant muscles. Rudy Simpson, Jeffrey 's associate pastor, had seen Jones speak at an out-of-state revival and began lobbying at church board meetings for the implementation of a visiting-minister fund from a percentage of the weekly tithes. In a month 's time, Rudy said, the fund would accrue to a stipend generous enough to attract a visit from the man who was " easily the most charismatic preacher in the country. I mean this fella is one heck of a fireball! " <p> Jeffrey was troubled by Rudy 's enthusiasm, and no less by the quick excitement of the Redfield Baptist board. Frank Patterson, slope-shouldered farmer and board chairman, lifted his squirming eyebrows and pounded knuckles on the folding table till his yellow-dyed hair shook from its mold. " It 's darn well time we had a hot-footed man-o-the-Lord coming through Redfield to scare people 's souls back to Jesus! If this fella 's as good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the kind of thing Christ 'd want us to do with the hard-earned cash of His flock! " <p> The room roared with Amens. <p> Jeffrey, leaning at the wall with a Styrofoam coffee cup in his right hand, raised his left hand and patted the air till the board grew quiet again. " Now maybe I 'm not the one to say this, but it seems to me that I can wind people up just as well as any out-of-state revivalist. " <p> The boardroom air grew muffled and thick, metal folding chairs squeaking, twenty male heads looking down into twenty laps. <p> " If it 's a revival we want, maybe we should think on how we can get that going ourselves, before we start throwing money around. " <p> There was silence. Silence like something cooking-bread rising and growing darkly overdone and nobody opening the oven. Finally Rudy spoke, edging a pensive index finger across his dark mustache. " Listen, Jeff, we all know you 're one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a lot lately, and times like these it 's good and healthy to get a dose of something new. Every preacher 's got a different style, you know? " <p> " That 's right, Jeff. We all know it has n't been any piece of cake for you and your family, " -this from Frank Patterson, nodding and narrow-eyed- " so why do n't you look at this like a nice opportunity to relax a little? Then, once this R. V. Jones is off to his next stop, you take us up where he left us and guide us someplace new. " <p> There was a rumbling consensus, twenty heads turning to Jeffrey, forty eyes bright with conviction, and Jeffrey leaned at the wall with a shrug and grin. <p> R. V. Jones flew into the county airport six weeks later. <p> He rolls closer to Angela now, till his cheek is pressed to her scalding thigh, runs his fingers along the inside of that thigh, feels the soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightgown. He loves this : the friction of his touch against the salt of her skin. Her body 's condensation. He shivers again. He wants to take her and grip her and make her scream. The desire is a kind of trance, and he surrenders to it often-lets the desire loose until it 's like a thing exterior to them both. It hangs just above their bodies, mastering them. Under its command they 've done things they never thought they 'd do. Their bodies have become like mouths and they 've eaten at one another with great hunger. They 've collided and whirled and made the bed frame convulse. For the last few years it 's been happening often-almost regularly-and every time, once it has passed, they lie blinking and unsure of how to look at one another, catching their breath as if they 've just come through great danger. Then in the darkness Jeffrey will feel the unbearable red heat in his cheeks, the low ache in his chest that wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'll think of Psalms 36 : They plot mischief while on their beds ; they are set on a way that is not good ; they do not reject evil. The bedroom 's darkness will collect, will condense and sharpen and drill fiercely at his throat, so he 'll disentangle his spent limbs from Angela 's and sit up and switch on the lamp. " We should n't, Angela, " he 'll whisper. " We should n't anymore. " <p> On the fateful day of Jones 's arrival, Jeffrey chose the Dodge for his drive to the airport-a ' 67 Dart, chrome-blue and convertible with sparkling muffler and a plate that read " Childs1. " He kept it covered with a fitted gray chamois at one side of the garage. Now he whipped off the cover, ran some polish over the hood and wheel-wells, and with the top down, went sailing out in his favorite blue driving cap, past Hubbard 's Gun Shop and San Joaquin Free Evangelist to I-12, the engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the tarmac and leaned against the front fender with ankles crossed, watched Jones 's plane float down, circle once and bump to a coasting slowness on the runway. Stairs were wheeled to the plane door and shortly Jones appeared, ducking out of the aircraft in a way that seemed magic-like a cantaloupe appearing from a pencil box. <p> 2. The Good Handshake <p> Jeffrey knows his strengths. He possesses interpersonal skills developed enough to cause envy in a first-rate politician. He can shake a hand like nobody 's business. It 's an art, he 'll tell you-the good hand-shake-and a real master will assert himself in just two or three critical seconds. Jeffrey shakes a hundred, maybe two hundred hands each week, and he thanks God every day that he was careful enough to learn this art from his father, who had a church in Angel 's Camp all through Jeffrey 's youth and who was a master trained by a master : Jeffrey 's grandfather, the first Pastor Childs. <p> R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like someone under a steadily lowering magnifying glass, kept getting bigger until he stood monolithically in front of Jeffrey and the Dodge Dart, the vehicle shrunken to the stature of a Matchbox car. A dark cap of tiny curls, like the soft half of Velcro, fit his large skull snugly. In one hand he held a monstrous plaid suitcase, a thing nearly half the size of himself, gripped nonchalantly as though it were just a purse. His free hand rose like something defying gravity, a concrete sledge suddenly gone weightless, and Jeffrey met it with his best shake-saw his pale hand enveloped and crushed in the squeeze of the cucumber-thick fingers. <p> " Pastor Ghilds, is n't it? " <p> " A pleasure. " Jeffrey struggled to manifest a Sunday smile despite the bolts of pain coursing his arm. He blurted : " They told me you were big, but good Lord! " and immediately regretted it. <p> Jones chuckled. His eyes fluttered downward demurely. " Well, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become my salvation. " <p> It was a passage from Exodus. Jeffrey recognized it instantly. Chapter 14 or 15. His brain was a veritable data bank of God 's good word. He believed it to be a special gift. Rarely did he lack a scriptural answer to the run-of-the-mill blasphemies of secular naysayers. <p> They managed to squeeze Jones 's suitcase into the narrow backseat of the Dodge. Jones filled the passenger side like a bear in a go-cart, reminding Jeffrey dimly of something just like that he 'd once seen at a circus. <p> He drove the long way home, skipping 1-12 for the county roads, peripherally watching the evangelist rattling in the passenger seat, those huge knees pressed against the dash. At length he swung onto a long straightaway between orchards and fired the Dart 's priceless cylinders. The car became a blue streak between the blurring tree rows, its muffler screaming like an afterburner. <p> Jones 's face broke into a big smile. He shouted over the engine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, will you! " <p> Jeffrey hollered : " You a car man? " <p> " Know a sweet thing when I 'm sitting in it! You a collector? " <p> " I 've got one or two! " <p> He had two : the Dart and an olive-green ' 68 Mustang with a keen champagne sparkle, which he also kept under chamois in the garage. " Childs2. " He showed Jones as soon as they arrived home. The evangelist ran a loving finger along the hood, touched the silver ornament, said : " Sweet stuff, Jeff. Sweet stuff. " Jeffrey grinned. <p> 3. The Shiver <p> Jeffrey does not believe the carnal act is a sinful thing in and of itself. The Lord says, after all, that marriage is a sacrament. But he so deeply adores Angela that it often overpowers him. He has such hankering thoughts for her sometimes-sudden rearing thoughts without context : thoughts while polishing the Mustang, while making sermon notes in his office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can he have such thoughts? His mind is a wild, rampant thing. <p> " What 're you reading anyway? " he says now, stroking Angela 's thigh. " Is it really so hard to put down? " <p> " Jones 's book, " says Angela. She closes it and shows him. There is R. V. Jones, filling up the dust jacket in a bulging blue turtleneck, teeth gleaming. Above him, red block letters : STAYING IN THE HOLY SPIRIT : TWELVE MONTHLY DEVOTIONS BY ACCLAIMED EVANGELIST R. V. JONES. <p> Jeffrey 's read the book already. During Jones 's visit, Redfield Baptist sold eighteen cases worth. This is his copy Angela 's reading, autographed and inscribed : To a real man of the Lord. Thanks so much for having me. -R. V. J. <p> " Why do n't you turn out the light, " Jeffrey says. <p> Angela obliges, sidles down beside him in the sheets, touches him with eager hands, and he feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shiver. <p> 4. The Souls in San Francisco <p> Jeffrey and Angela 's boudoir is on the second story of their four-bedroom house, behind double doors made of walnut. Next door is the upstairs bathroom, and beyond this the room where Samantha sleeps. She 's a senior this year and remains in a perfect state of grace-a blessing to her parents. On the honor roll for her fourth consecutive year, she 's already applied to Northwest Baptist College in Oregon, and she dresses with a punctilious tendency toward modesty and prettiness. Conservative necklines. Ruffled sleeves. Hair pony-tailed and ribboned. Not like most other teens. <p> Downstairs is the bedroom where Jeffrey Jr. slept until moving out last year. Now it stands empty, furnished sparsely with a twin bed and bookcase, next door to the guest room. Eight weeks ago R. V. Jones slept in that guest room. The church board arranged for him to preach on three consecutive Sundays, a plan that rattled Jeffrey 's pecuniary sense and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was only right that the visiting minister be hosted in the pastor 's house, so he found himself showing Jones around that Thursday after picking him up from the airport. " Here 's the fridge. Here 's the downstairs bathroom. Here 's the washer and dryer. " They stood just outside the guest room and Jeffrey gestured to the door at the end of the hall. " That was Jeff Jr. ' s room. He 's out of the house now, so you 're welcome to spread out your things in there. " <p> Jones said : " He off to college? " <p> " No. Did n't go to school. He 's twenty-one. Was time to leave the nest. Moved out to San Francisco with a couple friends. " Jeffrey tried to speak carefully, but the exasperation was plain in his voice. He heard it himself, then saw the evangelist 's ministerial antennae go up. <p> " San Francisco, huh? " <p> " You been there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once. " Jones was nodding his massive head as though swirling his memories of that place into action in his skull. It seemed a crystal ball of prophetic Christian disturbance had been stirred. " That 's one powerful city. A real battle 's going on there. Lots of different powers are fighting for the souls in San Francisco. " <p> Jeffrey pursed his lips, avoided Jones 's eyes. He wanted to step away, but found himself fixated on the blue molding around the guest room door. He muttered : " They say the whole place might fall into the bay someday soon. " <p> Jones squinted thoughtfully. His chin came up as though he 'd whiffed some elusive odor. " You see your boy much? " <p> " Once or twice this past year. " <p> He 'd seen Jeff Jr. once and he knew it, but he felt himself losing ground. A mean tug-of-war had started and he stood no chance against Jones and his imposing biceps. Jones filled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold out or surrender. <p> 5. The Prodigal Son <p> Jeff Jr. had been a barrel of trouble for the full two or three years before he finally moved to San Francisco. It started with his choice of friends. He was a solitary, quiet kid for his first three years of high school, bumping from the house with an oversized rucksack. Then in twelfth grade he fell in with half-a-dozen loose cannons and quickly, piece by piece, everything started to slip. His wardrobe changed completely over a single Christmas vacation. He began wearing tightly fitted blue jeans and army boots and sleeveless T-shirts. He sported berets and stocking caps and scarves and, in a clandestine act of complete revolt against Jeffrey and Angela Childs, had his ears pierced and fitted with three thick hoops each. <p> Jeffrey was prudent in taking the boy to task. He entered Jeff Jr. ' s room, sat beside him on the bed, spoke to him clearly and forcefully-but the boy just looked sullen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the changes were happening so fast and with such covert determination that Jeffrey was helpless to waylay them. After weeks of furious prayer, he resorted to calm expressions of his and the Lord 's paternal love. Employing his Redfield Baptist stationery, he wrote Jeff Jr. a careful note and left it in an envelope on the boy 's pillow. <p> I understand that this is your time of searching. I want you to know I am praying for you. Never forget God loves you. <p> But J. J. 's silence only deepened. The boy retreated into his room as into a cave and soon refused to attend church. By the end of his senior year he was driving the eighty-five miles to San Francisco nearly every weekend, packed with his darkly clad, anemic-looking friends in the sputtering, unwashed station wagon that belonged to one of them( which one of them, Jeffrey could never figure out). <p> Jeffrey scoured his heart and soul for some personal failure, some flaw of ethics that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew the boy went to see R-rated films with his friends-perhaps he had n't done enough to stop that. He knew the talk in the hallways of the public high school was rough and ignorant of Christian gentility-perhaps he should have thought harder about sending J. J. to the private Christian school out in Lodi. His mind raced and leaped, his parental codex wheeling before him. But the boy 's revolt was inexplicable, so distant were his life and the workings of his young mind. <p> J. J. darkened his blond eyelashes with black mascara, traced strips of charcoal eyeliner above and beneath both blue eyes, eyes just like his mother 's. " Why does he do that to himself? " Jeffrey asked Angela, feeling that she could somehow answer the conundrum in a way he could n't because the boy so much resembled her. " Why does he do that to his face? He looks just like a girl, does n't he? " <p> When the phone jangled during dinner one night early in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his son 's voice as he spoke to the boy on the line-somebody called Tim.( " Who 's this Tim? " Jeffrey murmured to Angela, only to meet with a shrug and shaken head.) His son 's voice, bright and dexterous, words tumbling out almost flamboyantly-such a far cry from the saturnine tone J. J. had favored whenever his parents ventured to draw him out. J. J. 's lips at the receiver pooched in a halfway-grin. J. J. 's supple upward inflections dancing over syllables with a soft liquidity almost feminine. Jeffrey heard finally, and to his terror, his son 's yellowy chuckle, the flittering off-hand laugh-and knew. Knew undeniably. Saw the black-lined eyes coasting down, the painted lashes batting with flirtatious pleasure. <p> " Jeff! " he roared from the head of the table-exerting a rage that made his wife and girl flinch and even startled himself. " Talk someplace else or hang up, will you! " <p> J. J. blushed scarlet, threw a glare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, slammed the receiver down, and stormed from the kitchen. <p> That week Jeffrey asked Rudy into his office for coffee, but they did n't drink coffee. Instead Jeffrey pounded a fist at his desk and wept into his other hand. " He 's gone wrong on us, Rudy! We 've lost our boy to the homosexuals! " <p> Rudy knelt beside Jeffrey 's chair and gripped the pastor 's shuddering neck, murmuring in his ear : " Pray with me, Jeffrey. " And in a soft voice the associate led their joint appeal to God, rose to a bellow that crested at twenty-five minutes, whispered : " Amen. " <p> Jeffrey, pink and sour-faced with tears, said he felt better. He went into his office bathroom and splashed warm water on his eyes. When he came back, Rudy was perched on the edge of the desk, one bent leg dangling, two brooding fingers stroking his thick mustache. <p> " People 'll find out, Jeff. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide it. " <p> " Good. Congregation deserves to know. " <p> " I 'll make an announcement. Set time aside. Folks 'll have questions. " <p> " That 'd be best, " said Rudy. " Spend a full Sunday on it. Open it up. Have a Q and A, then a prayer session. That many folks praying for your boy could make a heck of a difference to the poor young man. " <p> " Yes. " <p> " Whenever you 're ready. " <p> Jeffrey nodded, felt the tears returning at the dreaded thought of it, sank into his chair, sighed, rubbed the swollen wallets of his eyes. He reached and picked up the small snow globe from the edge of his desk and let it swing inverted between his finger and thumb. " May not be for a few weeks, " he mumbled, watching in the glass a tiny brown-robed Moses standing astride the rock of Mount Sinai, the tablets of the Decalogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow. <p> " That 's fine, " said Rudy. " You 've got to sort things out at home. Have you talked to Angela yet? " <p> Jeffrey shook his head. <p> 6. Forbidden Words <p> The bedroom is dark, but their eyes have adapted, black pupils swelling to drink the darkness, transform it to a vaulted monochrome. The air is filling with breath. Her breath, deep and long. His breath, quick and thirsty. She is beneath him, exhorting him. He has her in his grip, completely in his grip, and the joy of being held by him is in every dark pocket of her voice, her soft dark words. Little words, spoken over and over like an incantation. Forbidden words that thrill them both, expletives entering the air and charging it with a sharp and supersensory static. She is beneath him, her body in his hands-and yet they are both floating somewhere. Without bodies. Outside of their bodies. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three weeks that R. V. Jones slept downstairs. Always when it happens they struggle for quietness, and on those nights it was particularly difficult-the special danger raised them to a new euphoria in which they could barely stifle their blazing voices. In the morning, after the night 's illicit pleasure and its coda of shame, Jeffrey sat across from Jones at the breakfast table, watching the huge paws buttering toast with a surprising gingerness, and wondered if the evangelist had heard anything. A crackle in the guest room ceiling? Flakes of asbestos shuddering loose and drifting down through the darkness, Jones 's bare feet stepping on them in the morning? But the evangelist was an edifice of composure, as put together as a Grecian monument and nearly as hard to read. He talked in a meek, almost breathy voice, though he filled the Ghildses ' rooms with a presence of beast-like proportions, lumbering about with steps he could n't keep from thundering through the floor. <p> Jeffrey dreaded that Jones would prove an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The evangelist 's first sermon was like a force of nature. Jones stood gigantic at the altar, his voice booming through the microphone, fluttering up and down in modulations so engrossing that Jeffrey found himself straining forward, taut-bodied in his pew. <p> There was n't a rustle in the sanctuary, though hosts of enthused Amenls came from every corner of the congregation to echo under the high A-framed ceiling. In one muscular hand Jones hefted a black leather Bible. His other hand trembled on his outstretched arm, snapping into a colossal fist that pounded the air, or else jabbing a blunt forefinger heavenward. He closed his eyes, threw his head back, his thick neck flexed, and sweat beaded his temples and throat. The altar seemed to quake. Shouted Hallelujahis sprang from the pews with a profusion that bristled every tiny hair on the back of Jeffrey 's neck. He too shouted the word and punched the air in front of him with a spirited uppercut. <p> Jones went on past the hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. In an evocative denouement, he ended with a whispering prayer, kneeling before the congregation, his great head bent low under the freight of his magnificent humility. He gave a prolonged " Aaaaay-men!, " sprang to his feet and called the pianist, Mrs. Osborne, back to her instrument. <p> " Stand up! " he cried to the congregation, waving both his hands upward as though throwing something over his shoulders. " Stand up and sing with me to the Lord! " <p> The congregation shot to its feet in an awesome collective tremor. Mrs. Osborne pounded the keys with a force Jeffrey had never suspected to be lurking in her seventy-year-old fingers. Jones led the people in a quick, syncopated clapping, darting back and forth across the altar, and all those two-hundred bodies became one frenetic body, all those voices one tremendous voice, singing loud : Our God is an awesome God! The huge din vibrated through Jeffrey 's limbs. <p> On the Friday evening following Jones 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome dinner in the church gymnasium, a barbecue buffet sponsored by the Redfield Baptist board. Back at home afterwards, Angela offered to brew some tea. Jones said : " No, thank you. I sure wish you folks had told me about your boy. " <p> Jeffrey and Angela flinched as though an electric current had zapped them both through the floor. Jones loomed in the kitchen doorway, brow creased, forehead muscle bulging like cable knit. At some point during the board soiree the evangelist had been engaged by the chairman Frank Patterson. <p> " He told me about Jeffrey Jr., " Jones said, " and I 'm sorry to say I did n't know how to respond. " <p> Angela got busy with the kettle for the tea no one wanted. Jeffrey found himself standing at the sink, silently staring out the tiny greenhouse window. The dark sky was shot with taffeta clouds. The moon looked like a sunken bath toy. <p> Jones spoke very softly and Jeffrey kept from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame in this house. I wish that was n't true, but I can feel it. Frank said you 've told the congregation already. I do n't see why you could n't tell me. If I 'm going to do the Good Lord 's work while I 'm here, then I ought to know this kind of thing. " <p> Jones went on in this way, gently, his voice free of blame or consternation, but weighted with pleading sadness. Finally, he spread his arms and drew close to Jeffrey. Jeffrey turned and found himself folded into the muscular wingspan. Angela too had somehow become enclosed in it. Jones began a fervent prayer and their three bowed heads touched. Jeffrey trembled and wept and tried to subdue it, to hide it. He felt himself shrinking in those encircling arms. At his back, as if to ape the clenched and dismal whistle in his throat, the kettle started to sing. <p> 7. Thrilling the Mattress <p> He trembles now, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hears her voice, wobbling in a way that could be fright-but he knows it is n't fright. The mattress quivers. Their astonishment has suffused even the inanimate things around them, thrilling the things. Thrilling the mattress. Then Jeffrey feels the cool consuming current, the all-powerful wave crashing over him. Over Angela. He wants to scream but prays he will not. Angela wants to, he knows, and he prays again. <p> R. V. Jones sat at the kitchen table for lunch that first Sunday after church. They ate hoagies, Jeffrey 's favorite-the twelve-inch things filling their plates, garnished with glinting potato chips and dill pickles. Angela and Samantha shared one between them as always. Jeffrey watched, gnawing, as Jones plucked up his sandwich, the big thing dainty-looking in the evangelist 's massive grip, and all at once he 'd plummeted to his day 's lowest dismay. He told himself he would go somewhere alone once lunch was over, resolved to eat quickly and did, saying very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Samantha even spoke up, said : " It was very powerful, " gazing at the evangelist with sheepish eyes. <p> Jones blushed, moved a hunk of sandwich to his cheek and murmured : " I just thank the Lord for the gifts he 's given me. " He blinked twice in thought, summoned a scripture, then smiled and patted Samantha 's tiny hand. " Each has a particular gift from God, one having one kind and another a different kind. That 's First Corinthians 7:7, " he said, at the very moment that Jeffrey 's biblical Rolodex flickered to the exact chapter and verse. <p> There was a shriek and Angela jumped up shouting. " Samson, no! " <p> In the adjacent living room the calico cat, Samson, stood arched and thrusting over one of her strapless pumps. Angela scooped up the animal and tossed him away. Samson screeched with drunken indignation, but landed on his four nimble feet and pranced up the stairs. Off in search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deflowered pumps high on the bookcase out of reach. " We 've had him fixed and everything, " she said, blushing. <p> Jeffrey sneaked out in Childs2, said he needed to pick up a few things and would be back within the hour. He drove the Mustang along Highway 12. <p> Sunday traffic was sparse on the two-lane road, farms spreading out to the north and the south. It was autumn and the fields were being burned. A muddy smoke hung in the air, marbling the sky. Jeffrey kept the windows up and closed the vents, though it was stuffy in the car. Off the highway, four or five miles distant, he could see the low thread of flames along the horizon, like an eyelash to the land, and the black scrim of new smoke going up. <p> He drove without thought to time or destination. Soon he was flying through the dun-colored air at seventy-three mph. In the opposite lane a semi thundered past. The Mustang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind, watched the big evangelist commanding the altar, heard the prodigious Hallelujahis and Amenis from the pews. <p> Jeffrey knew himself to be a mover and shaker at heart, very like R. V. Jones. Extremely like. What separated him and the evangelist anyhow? How was it that he, Jeffrey Childs, third-generation minister, could stand and speak for an hour before his people, lifted to a sweating spin-cycle of conviction, and not elicit anything more than two or three muttered Amens? <p> True, Jones had a heck of a story : brought up in the poverty and squalor of a broken home, lured into sexual depravity and drugs as a young man, driven to attempted suicide, and finally delivered-miraculously delivered-when he found a Gideon 's Bible in a motel room drawer one night. He had read for eight long hours and heard the all-powerful voice of Jesus ringing in his ears, driving him to his knees, impelling him to open his heart and receive the Lord who made him and died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but it 's not the kind of stuff to make people shout and cry : raised in Angel 's Gamp, California, the second son of a second-generation minister ; reared in his father 's church( Angel 's Gamp Baptist) and always faithful to its teachings-his only period of defiance a short-lived month or two in his fifteenth year when he insisted on attending Pioneer Baptist across town, where he met Angela ; enrolled in Southern California Seminary at eighteen ; married Angela at twentyone( " I 'll have a church, " he said to her back then. " You 'll be my First Lady. ") ; pastured his first church( God 's Church in Stockton) until his thirty-eighth year ; came to Redfield Baptist five years ago. No sexual misadventure, no drug experimentation, no criminal transgressions. The story 's one compelling moment : that instance at age sixteen, sitting in a wooden pew in Angel 's Gamp Baptist listening to his father preach and being suddenly and inexplicably filled with the Holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ankles, quickly purling upward through his legs, his stomach, his heart, stiffening the hairs on his head. Knowing then, without a doubt, that he was meant to be a preacher. That he was called. A fine story, but one that clearly paled against the dramatic lighting of Jones 's. <p> Jeffrey tilted to glance in the rearview mirror. Perhaps it was something about his appearance, something physical. He knew he had hyperactive eyelids. All his life he had blinked twice as often as most people. It was not an inherited idiosyncrasy : his father 's eyes had not been like this, nor his grandfather 's. He became aware of the quirk only after he met Angela. She told him it was one of the things she loved most, so he 'd gone straight from total ignorance of the peculiarity to total acceptance, and had never for a moment considered it a detriment. " It 's endearing, " she said. " It gives you a whimsical air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!! Jeffrey flinched and tugged the wheel right, swerved hard from the oncoming lane where he 'd started to drift. A big rig roared angrily by. <p> " Good Lord! " Jeffrey panted. " Thank you, Jesus. Thank you. " <p> Adrenaline poured coolly into his gut till it seemed a chasm had opened. Black tunnel where wind shrilled. Such terrible vulnerability. Jeffrey knew the feeling. It was what he 'd felt in those last several weeks before Jeff Jr. left the house. His son 's debauchery had torn at his fatherly guts with incredible destruction. And the emptiness gaped most ruthlessly as he stood at the pulpit a week before J. J. moved away-as he confessed his son 's mortal sinfulness to the congregation. Took the boy 's sins upon himself. <p> " Many of you have probably noticed, " he 'd said, " that my son Jeffrey Jr. has not been to church for the last six months- " and then it choked him. Words piled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wooden podium and gagged softly into the microphone, tried to fashion words, could n't. He thought of Christ 's suffering-the unthinkable extent of it. He glanced helplessly at Angela, seated in her blue Sunday dress and staring up at him from the first pew, a tissue wrung ragged in her fingers. <p> " Angela, " he said. His voice lurched in great noise through the microphone, magnification of his inner terror. He stretched a quailing hand toward her, watched her stepping up to the pulpit beside him, felt the water flooding his eyes as she gripped his arm, heard the ripple of uneasiness in the congregation. <p> " It 's all right, Jeffie, " she whispered, leaning away from the microphone-and he was impressed by that : how collected she was even in a moment like this, thinking to lean away from the microphone. He felt her hand at his back, pressing there through his tailored jacket. " It 's all right, dear. We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can do it, Jeffrey. They 'll forgive us. " <p> He swallowed once-a great stone of gelid air squeezing down his throat. Then he clenched the pulpit and howled through his tears. " Our son is a homosexual! " <p> Hundreds of faces appeared to wince in the pews. He saw Samantha in the front row, her cold green stare leveled at the floor, incisors set hard into her bottom lip. Ah Samantha! -little Christian daughter. After he and Angela told her, she had wept through half the night for her brother 's soul. <p> Now Jeffrey tightened his grip on the wheel and the blackness in his belly seemed to congeal like tar. Oh Lord, it 's Jeff Jr.! <p> And now he saw it : Of course! -J. J. would never have gone astray if Jeffrey himself were n't so depraved, trapped in his cycle of lechery with Angela. How could he ever have hoped for his son 's salvation? -the boy raised in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much wire fencing. Jeffrey himself was to account for the boy 's sin, and God would hold Jeffrey 's congregation away from him so long as he lived in secret sin with Angela. Barely six days after he 'd confessed J. J 's evils, the Redfield Baptist board had begun talk of hiring an outside evangelist. <p> 8. Better Advertising <p> Jeffrey pulled south off Highway 12. He 'd been gone three quarters of an hour already and would have to bring something back. A narrow frontage road slithered ahead of him, blue gravel lusterless in the smoky light. Fourteen months before, the church board had come to a consensus on the need for better advertising. Across town, San Joaquin Free Evangelist had recently strung a big ten-foot banner between two PVC pipes. The banner faced Redfield Boulevard and said clearly in primary-colored letters : <p> San Joaquin Free Evangelist. Experience God 's Grace. <p> Services Sundays 9 AM 10 A.M. 11 AM Wednesdays 7 PM. <p> After much debate over an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Redfield Baptist. Jesus welcomes you. " <p> Jeffrey had driven out here to Gecelia 's Signs to place the order, and within three days the banner was up in front of his church. Now, pulling into the gravel lot in front of the dusty shop, he had a new idea-one inspired by the soul-searching tumult of his drive along Highway 12, one sure to please the Redfield Baptist board. <p> Cecelia was near seventy, stocky and short with a head of gray fleece, dressed in rumpled blue jeans and a plaid flannel buttoned to the chin. She was leaning on the front counter over a magazine when Jeffrey jangled the bells coming in. " Pastor Childs, " she said, and a mannish smile distended the gray folds in her face. <p> " Hi, Gecelia. Got another order for you. " <p> " This one for the church too? You must be pleased with that banner we made you, huh? I drove by there a couple times. Looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " Jeffrey watched her knobby hands moving beneath the counter, bringing out a rustly order form reeking of carbon. She handed him a pen, its blue cap deeply gnawed. <p> " Go ahead and fill her out like last time. " Gecelia propped her tumid elbows near the paper 's edge as Jeffrey wrote. " Heard about your boy, " she said. <p> The pen jumped in Jeffrey 's fingers. He steadied himself. <p> " Ron Meyer, fellow from your church works at Hubbard 's Gun Shop mentioned it. Saw Ron a couple months ago at the Chamber of Commerce meeting. " <p> " You 're praying for J. J. I hope. " <p> Cecelia said nothing, just pursed her mouth in a bemused smile. <p> Jeffrey finished writing and flipped the form back to her. " I want a ten-foot banner. White. Big red letters, all capitals. It 'll have two words. " He shaped his fingers as if adjusting a rearview mirror, setting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S COMING. " <p> Cecelia said : " That 's all? " <p> " That 's all. " <p> " What 's It? " <p> " It is the thing we all have to keep in mind. Have to keep it in mind every minute. Every last one of us-Christian or secular or Buddhist-whatever. Because when it happens that 's all she wrote. No second chances. " <p> " You think it 's coming soon? " <p> " No doubt about it. Times like these there 's no doubt about it. " <p> Jeffrey sped home on Highway 12 with a feeling of fatal bliss in his heart. It was good strong medicine to remember the Rapture. It was coming, he could thank the Lord for that. Even in the midst of R. V. Jones 's unstoppable evangelical coup, even in the midst of Jeff Jr. ' s waywardness and his own fateful lechery-still it was coming to wipe everything clean. The deserving would be gathered, the undeserving scattered, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown up expecting the Rapture. He remembered Mrs. Gardener-the famous member of his father 's church in Angel 's Gamp. She would stand from her pew during Sunday evening testimony, shuddering on eighty-something legs, waving bony fingers through the air and bubbling over in godly trance. She was known to have the scalding light of the Holy Spirit in her, and when she spoke nobody could doubt it. As a young man, Jeffrey looked to her with a novitiate 's kind of awe. <p> He remembered moments of lonesome terror spattering the days of his youth. Remembered coming home sometimes to an empty house-Mother and Father nowhere in any of the small rooms, though Father 's Chevy stood in the driveway, though something fragrant cooked in the oven-and his first thought the most terrible one : Like a thief in the night Christ will come. And when he comes, whatever faucets are running will continue to run, whatever is baking will burn. It had happened maybe, in the time between leaving school and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this earth through the fires and famines and blood-red suns of Lucifer 's rule. <p> Always, after a few moments of silence, as the possibility swelled and terror grew to restlessness, he would pick up the phone and dial Mrs. Gardener 's number. If Mrs. Gardener answered, then he could be sure all was well, that Mother and Father had stepped out a moment and would return. Then she did answer-her voice creaking through the line-and he returned the phone to its cradle without a word. Or she did n't answer and he listened in mute horror to the repeating purr on the other end. Delayed rhythms like the tenuous pulse of something dying. Listened till he was sure she would n't answer, then stood stricken in the empty house, catastrophe welling inside him till it burned in his cheeks-but at last Mother would come in from the neighbors ' house. Or Father would come in from the far tool shed, and Jeffrey would tremble with relief as potent as a barbiturate, would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would never sin again and so never fear again. That he would not be left when it came. <p> 9. Fearful Whirlpools <p> Jeffrey is lying beside her in the dark. Her naked breath stirs against his face. He tastes her. The earth seems very still. His body and hers are touching the air in the bedroom, the covers thrown off, nothing between skin and shadow. <p> Within moments the stillness becomes a threat, the darkness satanic-and Jeffrey sits up to switch on the lamp. <p> " What is it? " Angela says. By her voice, he knows she 's squinting. " Jeffrey, you all right? " <p> He hunches on the bedside, staring down into his naked lap where his flesh lies spent and ashamed, a body lying in its own vomit. His breath is quick and fitful. " Oh dear, " he says. <p> Angela touches his back. " Jeffrey? " <p> " Oh Angela, " he says-and the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ardently just fifteen minutes ago. " Oh Angela, it 's wrong. " He stands to escape her touch, feels her hand sliding off. He begins thrashing through the blankets for his pajamas and hers, and his voice grows sharp-harsh whispers biting at the air. " It 's WRONG, Angela! We CAN NOT do those things! Not anymore. We 're SICK, Angela! " <p> He goes to the carpet on his hands and knees, waving one hand beneath the bed, crawls to the foot of the bed and starts searching through the blankets tossed there. He finds his pajamas tangled in the comforter, untwists her nightgown from the sheets and thrusts it into her hands. Then he dresses himself in an angry, high-stepping caper. " We 're out of CONTROL! " he says. " Something 's gotten ahold of us. Something evil! " <p> Angela is slipping the nightgown over her head, wriggling as she pulls it down around her hips. " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " Her voice sounds far away. <p> " It ought a trouble you too, do n't you think? Not just me. " He sits tensely on the edge of the mattress, perched to leap up again at any moment. <p> " I try to understand, " she says. " But you enjoy it so much-and then you get like this. " He hears her body rustling across the bed behind him, feels her heated hands sliding along his shoulders. " Is it really that bad? " <p> He stares at the closet. Their clothes hanging neatly from the rod. Her shoes arranged in labeled boxes, two smart stacks across the shelf. " Afraid it is, " he whispers, and he feels the burning tingle in his eyes, sees the closet beginning to shimmer through tears. " Afraid it is. " The tears increase, his forehead spasms, then he begins to weep and feels a narcotic relief-that cooling peace overcoming him : the Holy Spirit. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and he hears the otherworldly grace that 's entered his voice, his words lucid and sovereign. <p> Suddenly he is up again, pacing at the foot of their bed, a nocturnal sermon gushing out of him. He raves for half an hour. All the time, the recent pleasures play through his head as if to mock him. If he keeps speaking, keeps naming them as the sins they are, he 'll drive them away and be able to sleep. Drive them away and be free of other nights like this, nights like fearful whirlpools. <p> 10. If We Want to Be One in That Number <p> R. V. Jones 's third and final sermon at Redfield Baptist was nothing short of a volcanic eruption. The evangelist rumbled and raised his arms and blazing words spewed from his red-squinched face. He spoke of fortresses-Redfield Baptist an impregnable fortress standing against the rampant sins of the world, buttressed by the huge muscles of the good Lord himself. He flexed his gigantic biceps to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted from their pews : Hallelujah! s and Amen! s enough to throw the enemies of Christ from the proverbial fortress walls. <p> Jones raised a splayed hand in the air to summon silence. The congregation grew quiet, quieter, then made not a sound. <p> The evangelist 's voice became ominously musical. " A week ago we put a big banner out front-a big banner with big old letters for all the world to see. What does that banner say, Pastor Childs? " <p> " IT 'S COMING! " said Jeffrey from the first pew. <p> " It 's coming, that 's right. Something big is coming, folks. Something big like we have n't seen since the creation of this world. " <p> The evangelist walked down the three steps of the altar to the floor. He towered there at the head of the main aisle. " When Christ comes back, " he said, " it 's going to be a heck of a party. I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward to that celebration. " His eyes seemed to phosphoresce, then his face fell-gravely, as if in pain. He raised the shank of one big index finger. " But I can also tell you this. " <p> The congregation dangled in silence. <p> " For those of us who are n't ready for it, it 's going to be one great big nightmare. That 's right, folks-it 's going to be a war. A war like we ca n't imagine. And if we 're going to be prepared for it, if we want to be one in that number that Christ takes home with Him, then we have to stay strong. Strong in the Lord. Strong against all the temptations of this world. " <p> The evangelist moved his chin in a cool signal, and a church member stood and walked to a side door of the sanctuary. Sunday sun spilled inward across the carpet. Five men came in. They lugged something long and metallic between them. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> The men placed a silver weight-lifting bench at the head of the main aisle, then turned back through the door. One man came out again carrying a massive barbell in both hands, which he dropped clanking into the arms of the bench. The other men scuttled between the bench and the door, struggling with huge circular iron weights-two men to each. The congregation squirmed, an anticipatory rustle growing to a low roar as the weights kept coming out. The evangelist directed the men in loading the barbell. Finally he nodded to the sweating assistants, and the men returned to their places in the pews. The church grew quiet again. <p> " Our strength is what matters if we want to be with Jesus on that day, and our strength can come only from the Lord. " Jones straddled the bench and curled backward beneath the freighted barbell. " Now this is four hundred pounds, " he said, gripping the bar, his face flaring into a concentrated grin. <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> " Jesus is my spotter, " said Jones. <p> Somebody clapped twice and hollered an Amen! <p> Jeffrey sat in a holy stupor, the rigid sanctuary silence burning in his ears. He watched the evangelist 's forearms bubbling. Muscles rising in the skin like soup-bubbles. Veins jumped thick and dark and the white polo shirt filled with physical power, pectorals hardening into steep, granitic mounds. He saw Jones 's face flooding maroon. Saw the elbows lock, the barbell quivering, lifting from its rests. He heard Jones 's smothered groan-a thing grumbling deep in that throat now webbed stiff with veins. Saw the grim set of the lips in his face, stretched straight, then downward at the corners. Saw the white spume glittering thinly at the edge of the mouth-and'had to look away. <p> At Jeffrey 's back the congregation roared-a godly tumult so loud it harrowed him. They raged without lapsing while Jones jumped up again, blowing through puffed cheeks, shouldering the sweat from his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you, Jesus! " <p> 11. That Modern Babylon <p> It 's been a half hour and Jeffrey has not grown calmer. Though the words have left him just now-the ravings, the hushed self-damnations, the biblical spurts-he finds he can not return to bed. Not yet. Second Peter is ringing in his head. Chapter two. The Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trial, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the Day of Judgment-especially those who indulge their flesh in depraved lust. Especially those, Jeffrey thinks-and it comes out in a murmur. <p> " What? " says Angela. <p> " Nothing, " he says, dismissive. She is lying with the back of one hand to her eyes against the glare of the lamp. He ca n't stomach her sleepy nonchalance. It gives him a spark of enraged pleasure to exclude her from his weighty thoughts. For an instant he thinks of her heavenly judgment-which will surely be disastrous as long as she shrugs off sin in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, that she 'll be charged for all the turmoil she 's caused him. It 's her fault after all, is n't it? -the way she lures him. Always lures him. But immediately he regrets these thoughts, suffers under the weight of the new sin that such thinking is, despises himself, knows he does n't deserve her. <p> " I need to go downstairs for a while. " <p> Angela 's hand twitches slightly, but she does n't uncover her eyes. " Are you sure? " <p> " Yes. It 's OK. I just need some time. " <p> " All right. Can you turn off the light? " Her fingers curl in the direction of the lamp. Languid gesture. <p> He switches off the light, passes through the room 's darkness toward the door. <p> In the hall, a pale moon ray spills through the window just beyond Samantha 's room. <p> Jeffrey 's bare feet throb. A tickling ache. The feeling fills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, like cool air gusting into him. Nothing is heavier than this hollowness. <p> He moves to Samantha 's door, presses the handle. The door creaks from its posts. Beneath the carpet, the floor pops and groans where he steps. A thin rail of broken hallway light slants inward and bends across Samantha 's bed, her sleeping form turned away from him. A glow-in-thedark cross hovers green in the darkness. Jeffrey can hardly look at it. <p> He moves softly down the stairs. The panels moan under his weight. Moonlight fills the living room window. He turns into the downstairs hallway and is met by a rancid odor and the granular crunch of something coarse under his feet, sticking to his heels. In the space between the washing machine and the door to the garage is Samson 's litter box-but the stupid cat has scattered it again. <p> Jeffrey waddles bowlegged to the pantry for the broom. " It 's the garage for you, mister cat. " He sweeps up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars, then gimps his way back to the dryer where he finds a cloth to wipe his feet. <p> He 's come down here to stand for a while in J. J. 's room-though he 's not sure why. <p> Stepping through the door, he hears a low ripping sound, the Ptttttt-ttt! of claws shredding fabric. " There you are! " He charges through the gloom and seizes Samson by the scruff. The cat squeals. Claws catch in the ravaged comforter. Jeffrey bears him to the garage door and tosses him out, hears the dull plodding of his animal-feet. " And you better not pee on my cars! " <p> He returns to J. J. 's room feeling avenged, sits on the unused bed, spreads his fingers through the tattered cotton of the comforter-little tufts of material coming off in his hands. In the room 's darkness sound seems amplified beyond reason : the whisper of the comforter, the whish of his restless feet in the carpet. He stares through shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his son anymore. J. J.-living eighty-five miles west in God knows what kind of neighborhood in that filthy city, that modern Babylon jutting on a toast-thin crust into the water and destined to crumble into the sea one day soon, when the Lord finally shakes the earth in his anger. <p> Jeffrey knows he must restore the Christian dignity of this house. Refortify his corroded image in the pulpit. Take hold of his congregation with a power like R. V. Jones 's. In the darkness now, it all seems as grim and harrowing as a holy war. The words from Genesis are scrolling big in his mind, and he is sure it 's just that serious. The Lord saw that the wickedness of humankind was great in the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts was only evil continually. <p> He will call Jeff Jr. in the morning. He will be kind and invite him for a visit. They can take the.22 out to the rifle range on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to shoot. There must be something of that love left in him, something of that passion for the rifle 's kick, the clank of shells, the burst of disks in the sky. <p> 12. Fig Leaves <p> Angela 's sleeping when he returns upstairs. He switches on the light by the bathroom and waters himself-soft relief as the darkness streams out of him. When he 's finished he finds Angela standing beside the sink, rumpled and squinting, her face imprinted with pillow creases. She is looking hard at him. <p> " Are you all right? " <p> Her voice is tender, and suddenly he 's unsure. <p> " I do n't know. " He sounds frightened. The words of Micah : Alas for those who devise wickedness and evil deeds on their beds! <p> Angela opens her arms. " Gome here. " <p> Jeffrey steps into her cogent heat. Feels her enfolding him. Her willful arms. He smells her warm bed-smell : salt on her neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, where he 's kissed her. <p> Ahead of him is the mirror and he sees himself embraced by her. The shape of her from behind, curving in her nightgown, pressed to him. Genesis 3:7 : Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked ; and they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves. <p> " It 's OK now, " Angela 's saying, her voice close in his ear, moisture of breath grazing his neck. <p> Jeffrey looks small to himself, standing in her arms like that. He is nothing like Jones. How could he even hope for all that Jones has? He looks into his own face, the eyes wide and glossy. " I 'm going to call J. J. tomorrow. Invite him out. " He is blinking. Blinking quickly. <p> " Good. " Angela holds him tighter. <p> Their bare toes touch on the carpet. <p> " That 'll be a start, " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Do not gratify the desires of the flesh. For what the flesh desires is opposed to the Spirit, and what the Spirit desires is opposed to the flesh. <p> " What 's the matter now? Are you shaking, Jeffie? ' <p> He does n't answer her. He looks away from the mirror, buries his face in her shoulder. <p> Tomorrow seems a long way off. Between himself and the telephone and the number he will dial, between this stifled hour in the arms of Angela and tomorrow 's muffled receiver tone, between now and the sound of J. J. 's crackling voice, the gregarious fatherly invitation, his son 's staid and suspicious acceptance-there is this night where so much darkness stirs, there is the splintered yoke of all the evil he must suffer. Hours and hours of silence. Struggle. <p> " Let 's go to bed, " Angela says. <p> Her body moves from his and she is stepping back into the greater shadows of the bedroom, her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinking into the squeaking mattress, warming the sheets again. He will slide down between those sheets as if easing into a thermal pool. He will float there all night, like one adrift on his back after a wreck, above him only unyielding sky, below him only the unlit deep. <p> Author Affiliation
