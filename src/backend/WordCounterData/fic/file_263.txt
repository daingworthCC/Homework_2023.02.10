5003641 # Do n't leave me alone with your computer. For your own good. Mine, too, actually. Trust me when I say this urge to gain psychic leverage over others through hacking email never really delivers. You end up like a priest post-confession, stuck with someone else 's bag of guilt, just you and all that chastity. All of which brings me to Dad. My father. # Dad was a man among men, as my mother, his long-ago ex, liked to remind me. A monument unto himself. He raked in oodles of cash building homes for billionaires. He was also built like a motherfucker : six foot three inches, oxen-yoked shoulders, cantilevered brow line, shaved head, polar-ice executive eyes. He benched in the 300s. He was so layered with muscle that he could only wear customized suits. Compare him to yours truly : six feet one inch, elongated mouth, scoliotic curve, and a sunken chest you can eat cereal out of. I 'm all wrists and elbows, stringy, and, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an uncharacteristic show of beneficence, let me crash at his McMansion in Weymouth for a few weeks after I lost my job. I 'd been living with Mom, but a judge had ordered her back into Boston Medical Center 's inpatient services. My first day at Dad 's house Lainey, his wife, declared that I 'm not to be home without either her or him present -- out of concern for the neighbors. Then she offered to pick up some antibacterial soap for my beard on her way back from power yoga. Lainey, I learned, was Environment and Beautification Director of the neighborhood association. She considered me, I imagined, a leftover from Dad 's errant past, that dormant virus you 've forgotten all about until it suddenly burns when you pee. # But hey, they were doing me a solid, so I obliged her wish and stayed away, luxuriating in the library or Dunkin ' Donuts until she came home from work, usually picking up Skylar, my ballet-dancing, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way. # One afternoon -- a glad and splendid April day -- I came home sooner than expected from a job interview. A wig factory in Brockton needed a data entry clerk, $18 an hour, provided you could pass a drug test. How could anyone not on drugs find the courage to show up every day at this mucid hellhole, I considered asking the HR rep. Nevertheless, I filled the cup. # It was a little after four o'clock, about an hour before anyone got home. I was in the kitchen rummaging for Funyuns and thinking how nice it would be to plant my ass in their automated massage chair and poke around for high-def porn when I noticed a Yahoo! email landing page on a laptop in the breakfast nook. Everyone used Gmail, so I refreshed and the user ID popped up as " Bottomslave. " Lainey! Holy shit! My stomach filled with lusty bile. It had to be her because Yahoo! appeals to women. Must be that fabulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it once to a social worker as mutated enlightenment. You are deeply in the moment, no thought of history or consequence. Time, that linear thread, spools around you, and somewhere deep in your chest is a hungry snake. The worst part is, it feels good. So I reached into my pocket, removed the thumb drive, quickly installed the keystroke-recording software, and hacked the password. # I had already done this to their Gmails. Skylar 's was all YouTube spam, Lainey 's was Facebook notifications and school stuff -- she taught fourth grade -- and Dad 's was mostly building/construction bids and libertarian listservs. I had to be careful with his account because he checked it constantly. I only logged in when he slept. Each night I failed miserably at keeping myself from reading everything he had sent that day, no matter how trite or repetitive. # The Yahoo! email, however, was a torrent of leather and face masks. I scoured with dark, hyper focus. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Domina. # The conversation referenced a curriculum of programmatic modules and the consequences of not completing each level. After a litany of incriminations, Domina told Bottomslave that tears were unacceptable. If it happened again Domina would summon The Bull. Bottomslave replied, I have prepped myself for Level IV. Next was a PayPal receipt for $500. # I should n't be here, I knew. Whatever secret life Lainey indulged was hers alone. I was about to logout and force myself to forget this ever happened when I noted a series of jpegs at the bottom of the thread. Do not do this, I told myself as I dragged them all side by side. Do not look at this, I said as they formed a slideshow of selfies, some taken by hand and others probably from a tripod. The image was the same for each : some ripped dude clamping his erection in a vice. The face had been cropped out, replaced with a black smudge. On the workbench next to the vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used when I helped him hang a mirror in Skylar 's room. In the background, blurry and dim, was his Olympic weight set, vinyl bench decaled with red flames. Dad was Bottomslave. # I cupped my mouth as I stared at that familiar top-heavy stance, crustacean triceps, gray hair patching his chest in a mosaic, nipples like scar tissue. The tip of his penis bugged out from the clamps like a knob of red putty. But what transfixed me, paralyzed me like a toxin, was the oval hole his face had vacated. It would n't stop watching. # T he fuck. I stood there, allowing it all to drip in. But it was almost five. I exited Yahoo!, cleared the browser memory, and sprayed the keyboard with Lysol. I washed my hands with industrial soap from the garage but could n't rinse it all so I re-rinsed with white vinegar, which reacted with a surge of foam. A scrape on the back of my hand flared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man! " I told the empty kitchen. I went through the hallway and into the bathroom, settled comfortably onto the vinyl foam toilet seat, and shit adrenaline. Then I looked in the mirror. I could swear I was seeing things that were n't there before. Like, I had more forehead than I used to. My cheeks were paler, beard follicles redder. A crinkle of lines between my eyes rooted down the sides of my nose and dispersed into what you 'd call, by default, a mustache, but which now seemed more like eyelashes stuck to adhesive. I examined it from different angles, puckering my mouth into a fat kissy-kissy. My lips looked intestinal. # I snapped out of it the second I heard Skylar burst into the foyer yammering and Lainey responding with a sunny reprimand. Skylar stomped upstairs. I waited until the house was still, removed my sneakers, and slid through the kitchen to the back door. Halfway there my ringtone began blaring in my pocket -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the library men 's room. I dropped my sneakers silencing it. Lainey stood in the dining room entrance, staring at me, mail in hand. # " Steven, " she said. " Wow! You scared me. I thought someone was getting killed! " # She pressed the mail to her boob, panting. She wore this turquoise blouse whose languorous collar slung down her chest. # " Do n't tell, " I said. # She chuckled. " Do n't tell who? What should n't I tell? " She paused. " What 's that? " she said, sniffing the air. " Is that vinegar? " # I stepped back. Yeah, the kitchen reeked of vinegar. An envelope fell from her hand, and I immediately scooped it off the floor. My hand shook. She took my wrist and gently lifted it to her nose. " Vinegar, " she mused, letting go and wiping her palm on her thigh. " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " Whatcha making? " # " S-salad dressing -- " I 've never stuttered before in my life. She looked around. The kitchen was undisturbed, zero sign of food prep. She raised her eyebrows and began irradiating me with her neon-blue contacts. I bit my top lip. # " Sounds yummy, " she said and turned and walked away, black yoga pants forcing her ass to tick-tock side to side like it too had my number. # The phone call was from Mom. She left a seven-minute message. I deleted it. # A s a fine arts student at UMass Lowell, Mom had been a brainy Marquis de Sade-loving hedonist who resented being born a decade too late for the Weathermen. She glamorized risk. She gobbled pills. She dressed like a geisha and partied with bikers. She introduced herself to campus Christians as a born-again Satanist. Dad impregnated her at a party then drove her to Vermont 's northern kingdom on the back of his motorcycle. I was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months later they moved to an apartment overlooking oil tanks in Chelsea. Mom read to me from Rimbaud and Thus Spoke Zarathustra and made me memorize " Howl, " anal-sex parts and all. When I was ten, she gave me a joint. # Dad, however, started screwing around, and Mom countered with revenge fucks. Once, he took a pipe to a car he thought belonged to a boyfriend. It did n't. Once, she got him with a fork. # Then an interesting thing happened. As their relationship caved, Dad became sly, ambitious. He reconnected with a successful uncle. He networked with building-industry types, grabbed opportunities. As for Mom, she fizzled. She bloated and got weird, drank, forged prescriptions, got caught, forged more. When I was twelve, Dad met Lainey at a waterfront bar in Revere. After a few drinks they took a moonlit walk on the beach. Story goes that while they were strolling along the surf and Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Careful, I know Tae Kwon Do. " Then she showed him a move. After that it was just me and Mom. # J ust before dinner Lainey stood in the kitchen making a pouty face. " No one 's taken out the garbage all day. Boo! " Then she said, " Go Stevie! " as I bound the plastic drawstring and headed through the garage. # As I walked across the driveway Dad 's ash-gray GMC Yukon pulled up and parked next to Lainey 's pumpkin-colored Honda. He got out and immediately checked his phone. He must have come from some bigwig meeting. He wore a red, fitted dress shirt and black slacks creased like twin samurai blades. His bald head, as well as his shoes, gleamed. # " How we doing? " he said, sliding his phone into his pocket. # I dangled the garbage at my knees. I did n't know how to manage this sense of bottom-feeder intimacy. # " What 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bag over my shoulder. # Dinner was bluefish that Dad had caught and cleaned. When Lainey, who smiled brightly at no one in particular, leaned over and placed the casserole dish on the heat mat, I felt her kundalini aura glide along my skin like frictionless nylon. # " Buon appetito! " she said. # As usual, Lainey prompted Dad to prompt her about her day. then prompted him about his, a family discourse probably modeled in a Parenting article. There were stacks of that mag all over the family room. # So listen up everyone : Lainey had a great day, a real breakthrough with that Ukrainian kid with the personal-space issues. A wonderful example of how social supports can pull together. And if that was n't enough, Dad also had a great day, closing a deal with a CEO who wanted a 6,000 square-foot house in Weston, complete with a walk-in safe. He set his fork down and looked at me. " This guy 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's like I been saying. " # Dad 's been saying that in twenty years the American dollar will be worthless, and that unless you 're investing in precious metals, you 're screwed. His Mesa Burglary safe downstairs, built into a brick wall, contains a small stash of gold, silver, and platinum. # " So the idea is, " Lainey said, I think also to me, though she was studying her plate, " we pay Skylar 's college with gold coins. " Dad wiped his mouth. # " Princess school takes gold, " I said. Skylar looked up, assessed me, then giggled. A temporary tattoo pealed from her cheek as she grinned. I made a silly face back at her. # " It 's an investment, " Dad said. " This is me looking out for my own. " It empowered him to say " my own. " He said it, like he says most things, in a tone that neutered challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your family for you. " He waited a few beats before picking up his fork. # " And that 's why we love you, " Lainey said. # " You better, " Dad said, approximating a grin with the edge of his mouth. # He chewed slowly, glancing up every few moments. Each time I looked at him I could feel that empty, redacted face watching me. I tried to mentally paste him back in, to gaze at the whole of it -- his face, his chest, his agonized hard-on -- but that only made me sickly aware of the snake within, now dead, laying on top of my bowels. # " What 's going on over there? " he asked dryly. " Do tell. " # " Just contemplating my future, " I said to my plate. # After I loaded the dishwasher Dad told me to spot him. His new one -- rep max was 370. # " Downstairs? " I asked, awkwardly thrilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finder, an array of hand tools -- all his home-improvement implements laid out, itemized. At the end of the workbench was a black whetstone-wheel wired to a foot pedal. I wondered if it had anything to do with Level IV. # " Here we go, " he said. He stretched out on the bench and worked through the warm-ups, camouflage tank top stretched to capacity as his pecs twitched with tiny spasms. " Get ready, " he said. He cracked his knuckles, panted savagely through his nose, and grabbed the bar, inching it up toward me as he released a singular throat-ripped howl. His lids fluttered, revealing slices of white eyeball. I hung over him in case something went wrong, like his muscles giving out and the bar falling toward his neck, at which point I 'd grab it and help bring it back up. Maybe. Hard to anticipate. But no matter. He did it. He dropped the bar into the holders, breathing damply. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments he slowly eased himself up and rested at the edge of the bench, fists pressed into his thighs. " Let 's see what you can do, " he said, looking at me over his shoulder. # Huh? I told him maybe next time. I told him I was tired. " Stop it, " he said and stood. He walked into my personal space and tilted his head at the bench. And bloated, I added. He closed his eyes, exasperated. I gave in and laid down reluctantly on the red flames, shivering as his cold, leftover sweat seeped through my shirt. He adjusted the plates, told me to breathe deep. Let my rib cage expand. Easy for him to say. " Let 's see what you got, " he said. # He stood behind me, spotting. His face was upside down relative to mine, his mouth disappearing behind the bar. All I could see were his eyes and forehead and moist, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He leaned forward. " Let 's get the show on the road. " I freed the bar from the grips and it careened straight at me. He caught it just in time. # " Do n't worry about it, " he muttered, guiding it back. He reduced the load, and I tried again, and again my muscles caved. And that 's how it went. Dad decreased the weight in small increments, and with each new try I failed. Almost. When there were only two discs left, I managed to squeeze three reps. I dropped it back into the holders, too depleted to feel a thing. # He stood behind me, silent, no doubt wondering what Mom did to make me this way. # " Bar alones forty-five, " he said after a few moments, " so it ai n't nothing. Anyways... " # He started moving around, straightening things up. I did n't budge. # He checked the water level on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how life sometimes dishes out a sirloin steak, and other times a shit burger. As he applied this more broadly to his philosophy of self-reliance and the need to get out of " welfare thinking, " I closed my eyes and the empty face drew near, raging, blank. # Oh, and by the way, he said, that reminded him. " What 's this I 'm hearing about you and salad dressing? " I opened my eyes and blinked at the flickering fluorescent tube. " Nothing wrong with it, " he went on, " just wondering. " He walked up the stairs. " Does n't hurt to be normal once in a while, " he said and shut the door. # M om was back on her feet again and began asking me to move in with her, but a guy at the wig factory had an attic for $400 a month. I took it. It was the kind of crawlspace you 'd keep a hostage in. That summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I almost ended up in the ER. By the time fall arrived it was a more bearable kind of hell, and that seemed fitting. I had spent the whole summer trailing Bottomslave, and it felt appropriate that I too swelter as we journeyed through each stage of his mortification. # I called him once in a while. No particular reason. Just to shoot the shit. We never chatted for more than a few minutes before he had to go. If he would have offered lend me cash that would have been helpful too. But what can you do? Twist his arm? Ha, ha. # Although I ignored Mom, she would n't let up. She tried me one day when I was cradling my laptop on the attic floor, poring over a new batch of email exchanges in which Bottomslave was resisting a recent module. Macaroni had just boiled over on my portable electric burner as Domina stated that from the moment she set eyes on him she knew he was a quitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw it in a plastic basin. What he really deserved, said Domina, was The Bull. I wanted Bottomslave to remind her that he could snap her neck with his thumbs. Instead I saw a PayPal receipt for $1,000. # The primal ringtone screamed in my pocket. It was Mom. I sent it to voicemail. # " Email and Facebook are blocking my logins, " said her message. " I 'm losing my mind! " She went on about how she wanted to shoot herself. After all, how would I like it, she demanded to know, if I could n't access email or Facebook? It made her feel so cut off from the world. # Could I swing by Dobbs 's place and take a look at their computer? # What kind of shame does $1,000 buy? Is it really that much better than the free stuff? # Besides, Mom continued, she had n't seen me since March( that was the court order, but she left that out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I texted, Whatever. I 'll take a look. Sunday. I thought for a moment and then texted her again. Reboot and let me know if that fixes it. My phone screamed back immediately, but a security alert warned Bottomslave that someone was logging into his account from a dubious location. Me? I let the call go to voicemail and deleted the alert. Why ca n't her phone send texts? she wanted to know. She can receive them but then what? That also drove her crazy. Can I teach her to text when I come over? I texted back, 3 p.m. # I thought about the price tag all day. And the next. I spent an entire afternoon sitting on the top rung of an industrial ladder in the wig factory rereading every Bottomslave email. I added up the receipts. $4,700 total. Jesus. For that and other reasons, they fired me. # One morning two days later I was in the attic sitting at the edge of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd be heading to Mom 's. Most of the crust was too rubbery from repeated microwaving, so I threw a piece across the room, hitting the enlarged, color printout of his excised face taped to the wall( cockless). Friends were in short supply, but if I had one over I would have said, See that guy on the wall? He pays thousands of dollars to feel the way I feel for free. How fucking lucky am I! Then I said, aloud, illusory friend laughing with me, " Let 's really level the playing field! " I cracked my knuckles, panted savagely through my nose, logged into Yahoo!, and with a singular throat-ripped howl forwarded every email to Lainey. Everything. The receipts. The pics. The complete works of Bottomslave. I also included a note : I 'm sorry you had to find out this way. Please forgive the humiliating darkness that is me. # D obbs answered the door. " Hiya big guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. # Dobbs. I 'd known him for years. Mom 's off-again, on-again man/ boy -- depending on the lunar phase of his marriage. Dobbs was everything Dad was n't. With his neglected mustache and fatty jowls he had the face of an affable rodent. His stomach, contained by a Charlie Daniels Band 1981 World Tour concert jersey, swayed like a bag of water -- which it probably was since he struggled with fluid retention. He was nice enough, but it was the idle accommodation of someone out of moves. # He let me in and then went back to the kitchen table where he was watching TV. Mom was in the living room watching TV. They were both drinking diluted orange juice out of pint glasses pinched from bars. It was 3:30 p.m., and a half-empty bottle of Everclear grain alcohol stood brazenly on the microwave. I nervously checked the Yahoo! email on my phone. Nothing. # When something like Dad flames out, what goes with him? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and refilled. # In slow motion. Mom looked up toward me and smiled. She sat on the couch in a green bathrobe that hung open above the knee. The shoulder seam was bound with a strip of silver duct tape. Her feet, dry blisters peeling along the big toes, splayed on a coffee table. " Steven! " she said with blurry cheer. She placed the drink on a chair beside her. She looked at the drink, then at me, and shrugged. " Sit, " she said, tilting her head toward the magazines and coupon tabloids and VHS tapes littering the rest of the couch. I stood. # " Do you want a straw? " she asked, looking at my cup. It was a plastic McDonald 's cup. I wanted to say, Yeah. Get me a fucking straw. Instead I said, " I 'm good. " # " Something to eat? Did Dobbs offer you something to eat? I think we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat? " # I began shaking with hunger. # Dobbs 's chair chafed the linoleum and before I could answer he appeared and eagerly handed me a large plastic container stuffed with cigar pretzels. " Here ya go big guy, " he said. He already had one in his mouth, chewing it along with part of his mustache. I set the container and my water down next to Mom 's feet and wolfed a pretzel as I checked Yahoo! # " I forgot we had those, " she said with delight. She was drunk, a benign and lazy drunk. " So we have a room for rent in the attic. Did I tell you that? " Her eyes were pink, crusted sediment by the nose. The acne on her cheekbones and forehead, a side effect of Lithium, was muted under a layer of walnut-colored makeup that might have been mistaken for a suntan. She kept blinking at me. I could see in her face the ghost of what she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I grabbed a couple more pretzels and sat on the arm of the opposite side of the couch, feeling my blood sugar drop even as I ate. Mom closed her eyes and smiled as though enjoying a sea breeze. Her emails were blather. Advocacy petitions to state reps on behalf of the incarcerated. Dobbs, weirder still, contacted realtors and posed as a high-end buyer. He claimed, in his messages, to possess vast, inherited wealth. Speaking of which, I checked the email. Then I checked it again. Nothing and nothing. # Mom opened her eyes and said how wonderful it was to see me and how she missed having me around. And then, right on cue, she added, " You 're a beautiful soul, Steven. " # She often tells me this at the beginning of her drunken arc. # " I know, " I said. " Where 's the computer? " # " I mean it Steven. Do n't let anyone tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're... you 're... " She lifted her chin, eyes closed, as though consulting an oracle. The word she was looking for was virtuous. " You 're virtuous! " she said, beaming. # " I know, " I said. " So where 's the computer? " Mom empowered me to be curt, rude. Around her I could be as much of an asshole as I wanted, and there would be no consequence. # " Any way, yes. Computer. " She scanned the living room, frowning. " Love, " she called, " where 's the computer? " # " Sheila came and took it, " Dobbs called back. " Remember? " It sounded like, B'member. # " Ohhhhhh, " she said. " That 's why she was here. I did n't realize it was Sheila 's. " To me, " That 's such a shame because your idea to turn it off and back on solved everything. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to do now? " Then, back to me, " You have an extra? " # Note : I came here to fix an un-broken computer belonging to Mom 's boyfriend 's wife. # And it 's not even here. # " Frankie 's kid got a Mac! " Dobbs shouted. I did n't give a shit who Frankie was. # " Steven, I am so sorry, " she said. " I feel like such an idiot. You came all the way over, and that woman, " she paused and caught her breath. " That woman. Have I told you? " # " Tell him ' bout the dog! " Dobbs called out, still in the kitchen. # As I sat there inhaling pretzels and refreshing Yahoo!, Mom launched into this thing about how Mrs. Dobbs had brought home a dog for Dobbs when they reunited, and the next day, when he 's walking it and picking up its shit, he sees the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missing. She 'd kidnapped the pooch from a family with a little kid just four blocks away! # " Tell him ' bout the stapler! " Dobbs called, and as I refreshed, she launched into this thing about how Mrs. Dobbs whacked a pharmacist in the ear with a metal Swingline when her insurance would n't pay for Ativan. The stapler, she said, was attached to a metal chain, and Mrs. Dobbs noosed it around her wrist when the guard tried to carry her off. Dobbs continued calling out prompts from the kitchen, but she eventually ran out of gas and sighed and lifted the edge of her bathrobe over her knees and called me Keith. That 's Dad. She laughed and corrected herself and said, " Please come live with us Steven! " # You see, she explained, Dobbs ca n't work on account of his swollen feet, and standing for too long, which everyone at the shop does, hurts. Also, her friend was supposed to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month. Thing is, they need someone around the house who can help out with stuff. It 's too much. The attic is furnished. Pay whatever I want. # " How 's that prick of a father doing? " # That startled me. She sat up, inching closer, as though the question formed a bond. # She coughed up a laugh. Duct tape broke off causing the shoulder seam to gape. On her skin was a mushed-up Band Aid. I refreshed and refreshed and refreshed. # " You get a medal for living there, " she continued, enjoying her feeling of camaraderie. " I do n't know how you did it. I could n't be in a room with him for two seconds let alone two weeks. He 's a very arrogant man! " She fell back and sighed. " Like he knows everything. " # Dobbs called out, " What can you do. He 's harmless. " # Suddenly a message from the Yahoo! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logging in from scratch. Same message. I tried three more times. The third message stated, Invalid username. Bottomslave had ceased to exist. My torso started leaking chilly droplets. # " Got ta go, " I said, even though there was nowhere to go. I stood up and immediately felt nauseous. I felt it in my belly and lower back. I sat back down but missed the couch. # " What 's wrong with you? " Mom asked. # I requested something to puke in. That rattled her. She lumbered up to her feet and scanned the room helplessly. " Hey Love, Steven needs to throw up in something! " # " He 's throwing up? " Dobbs shouted. " Tell him use the toilet! " # She looked around the room mumbling " fuck fuck fuck " and finally grabbed the pretzel jar. As she leaned forward her bathrobe opened, revealing an abdominal rash. # I cradled the plastic jar in my lap and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be any second now. Dobbs labored into the room and repeated his toileting advice. I could hear ice in his drink. Mom said that I 'm fine and just need to take it easy. He said, " Mm-k. " # Meanwhile Dad was falling, and he refused to let go of me. # D ad 's a motherfucker lifting the rear end of a Ford Tempo off a mangled ten-speed, bellowing as he grips the bumper with his high-voltage electrical gloves. The gloves are black and scaly and reach his elbows. As the car rises, I grab the back wheel by the spokes and drag it fast before he eases it back down. Granted the car 's a compact with over 200k miles if you discount the rebuilt engine. It 's Dobbs 's. I was coming home from a Craigslist hookup gone horribly wrong when I drove it into a Waffle House. # Calling him was a rash decision. I had barely seen him in two years. Right after I moved back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about six months. He called me once when he needed my social security number for a form. Lainey, he said, was spending time with her parents in Connecticut. Skylar, too. A few months after that they sold the house in Weymouth, and he moved to Lowell. I called Skylar on her birthday, and she said she wished she could visit him more often, but Lainey did n't like his neighborhood. She said, " So I 'm like, whatever. " # My hookup failure happened after midnight in Tewksbury, and on my way back, I decided to swing by the Waffle House and see what they had for under five bucks, which was all I had since the non-masseuse would n't give back my four twenties. But even worse than that, I was becoming homeless again. Mom was currently under observation at McLean following a debacle at the T stop, and Dobbs 's wife had begun legal proceedings to take the house on account that he 'd be dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his liver. In a few days, this car would probably be my home. As I drove into the parking lot, self-pity seized me like a fever. Not only could n't I afford rent, I could n't even afford a woman to jerk me off. I slowed the car, panted savagely through my nose, then pressed the gas and gunned it straight at the Waffle House 's rear delivery ramp, jamming the brakes when an old black man jumped off his bike right in front of me. I skidded and dragged the bike into a cinderblock wall that fenced in the HVAC. At that point I had slowed to maybe thirty miles per hour, but when I hit the curb and the car lurched upward and smashed into the barrier, my stomach almost left my body. # The car sloped on an angle, the crumpled front end on the walkway and the rear on the asphalt. Somehow the bike ended up right under it. I sat on the trunk as the police -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. My story : the brakes died. Even the black man believed it. The car, not surprisingly, was fucked. The radiator had cracked at the base and, after an initial geyser, was still coughing steam. Who could I call? Friends were in short supply. Then I realized that Lowell was one town over. # Funny luck. He was on his way home from working a shift at the gym. He was a manager there. He still built houses, only now he worked for someone else, and jobs were sporadic. When I asked if there was any way at all in heaven or on earth he could come get me, he laughed. # When I told him where I was, he said, " Figures. " # The old man with the mangled ten-speed thought it was important that everyone, police included, understand that he was a pastor. He probably assumed this would expedite freeing his bike from my exhaust system, even though the cops kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There it is! " the pastor announces, but it 's Dad, arriving in a pickup whose driver-side door is a different shade of blue from the rest of the car. He parks, and the door opens with a jarring scrape and a plunk, yet closes without any audible resistance. # " How we doing? " he says, and he 's bigger than ever. His shoulders and pecs contort his T-shirt 's Planet Fitness logo. He clamps my collar bone in a pressurized squeeze and says, " Tell me what you did, Stevie, " before he shakes me loose. His body is bigger, but his face, especially below the eyes, has thinned, even sags a bit. A dark, shadowy buzz cut shoehorns the back of his head, and I realize, not without a dizzy swell of irony, that he 's gone bald on top. # I lie as he squints at the front bumper. I explain how my " girlfriend " in Tewksbury just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup of tea, how the brakes gave out, how I almost killed a guy, how I have nowhere to live, how unemployment is running out, etcetera. # " Sorry to hear that, " he says. # The pastor tells Dad he 's a pastor. Something about Dad compels the man to remove his cap. I notice he 's wearing a blue shirt that seems official, more postal than clerical. Dad nods at the guy, then greets the cops with a collegial, " If it ai n't one thing... " # One of the cops shakes his head and says, " What can you do. " # I explain how the tow truck will get here within a half hour, and the pastor jams his hat back on and wants me to explain how exactly he 's supposed to get to all the places he needs to get to. I suggest that his parish take up a collection, and that pisses him off because he thinks I 'm mocking him, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, let 's get this guy his bike back. " # He tinkers around the bumper a few moments, then goes back to the truck. That 's when I notice the girl. I did n't see her at first because the truck is shaded under a heavy tree. She sits in the passenger seat, and her face is suddenly illuminated by the light of her phone. She looks bored, impatient, black hair and lipstick. She 's young, maybe just a few years older than me. # Dad billows the tarp covering the rear cargo. Things clank. He emerges into the street light armored in protective gloves and approaches like a soldier. " OK, Stevie, " he orders. " I lift, you pull it out. You do it fast. Ready? " # He squats low and bends forward at the waist, torso angling against the trunk as he reaches underneath. His form is perfect, body shaped like a numeral 4. The cops look up. One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. There 's a quick delay in my response only because I ca n't stop looking at his face, at how, at this moment of exertion, it compresses the whole of his life, all the unbearable pain, all that violent triumph, all squeezed into a single, excisable oval. How close to killing me would he go should he ever learn what I did? The back of the auto rises above the wheels, and both he and the car creak and groan in unison when suddenly the wheels themselves are levitating one, two, three inches off the ground, and from how he screams my name you 'd think he ' s being murdered. I grab the wheel and yank furiously and pull the bike out along with a chunk of muffler. The car goes back down. Dad extends his legs and exhales like a beast rising from a kill. He pulls off the gloves as the cops clap. # The bike 's about as fucked up as the car, and this surprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warped wheels. He does n't thank Dad, but Dad does n't care. Thanks are never the point. The man even tries to ride it but immediately topples. A cop laughs and claps again. # For him, this shift has been pretty goddamn entertaining. Without a word, the pastor wobbles the bike out of the lot and vanishes down an unlit street. # Tow truck arrives. Dad negotiates. Car 's mounted. Cops leave. As we walk to the pickup I ask where they 're taking it. # " That shit 's toast, " is all he says. He throws the gloves in the cargo and opens the door. # Again, the scrape and the plunk. " Stevie, Maria ; Maria, this is Stevie. " # She puts down her phone. In the cab light, I 'm shocked at how much older she is. In that brief clip of time between when I first saw her and now, she 's aged at least fifteen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " in a sing-song voice, then looks away. Immediately I 've got her number. Here 's Maria : She 's a beaten down version of Lainey. She 's got all the parts : tight jeans, big tits, lavish hair. But unlike Lainey, this one goes through life strategizing ways to make older men forgive her for existing. " Move over, " Dad tells her. She slides into the middle. # The pickup reeks of cigarettes and air freshener. Sunglasses dangle like a body from a seashell necklace that loops around the rear-view mirror. At first the truck resists starting, but after three tries it catches and Dad revs the engine before pulling out of the lot. # I start rattling off places he can drop me. Like the commuter rail. It 's only about four hours until service starts. We pass a motel next to a strip club, and I suggest that, too, then confess I 'm broke. Dad says cut the shit. As long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ futon right off the living room where I can get some privacy. He says Maria wo n't mind at all. # " I do n't mind at all, " she says. " It 'll be fun! " # " There you go, " Dad says dryly, staring ahead. # The relief I feel as we pull onto I-93 is enormous. Maria goes back to her phone, giggling softly to herself. We shoot past three exits before I feel like we 're some kind of family. I tell them both how deeply I appreciate this. Not to worry. Dad says. I 'm sure that compared to Mom 's gutted life, he feels on top of things. As for what 's going on in the shadows, I 'm curious. Dying to know, actually. And I start to feel it again, the urge, that hungry snake inside. I could probably borrow his truck and swing by the house and grab the spyware. Because I can. Because when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, what kind of person would n't do that? What kind of person would simply take what 's offered and let the beast go hungry? If only for a day. Or a life. What would that person look like? Could he possibly look like me
