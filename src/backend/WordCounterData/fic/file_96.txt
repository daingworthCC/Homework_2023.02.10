1014141 They 're saying my name in Maude 's room, but that does n't mean I 'm the topic of conversation among all the women watching my sister on her deathbed. Abigail is just using me to talk about something else that 's on her mind, some kind of angle she 's working to get at one or the other of that bunch in there waiting around and putting in the long hours of the job they 're undertaking. Abigail is entertaining herself by referring to me by name, the way a cat will knock a sweetgum ball or a cotton fluff or some other piece of trash around the floor with first one paw, then the other one. Just keeping in practice, working on its style with whatever 's before it for a target, not really serious about what it 's doing but not wanting to pass up an opportunity to hone its skills for the time ahead when something actually worth killing and eating will show up. And it will, because something always does, and it 's just a matter of time until the chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Maude 's bedroom, everybody will look up and say howdy to me, even Maude, the one who 's doing the dying and has the most serious job of all of these women waiting ahead for her alone. I say even Maude, but I should say particularly Maude. Particularly, because that 's the way Maude is, taking time away from her dying to say howdy, and that 's one of the things that 's eat away at me all these years of being around her, most of all. It wo n't let me alone, that feeling my sister 's treatment of me has built up inside me over time, and I have never been able to get it outside and shut away from me for good. I have tried, though. I give myself credit for that. I have tried to expel it and get it out of my system the way your body will tell you to do when you 've taken something into your stomach that it ca n't abide, ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it was sweet at first and easy to swallow on down and you felt like it was doing you good, there came that time, that little uneasiness in your chest and gut that said now wait a minute, are you sure you want this, are you positive it 's going to benefit you on down the road, are you counting on this to stay with you? Why is it, I asked myself at first, way back when I was a young one trying to get out from underneath Papa, the preacher and teacher and the farmer who ran everything, the man everybody everywhere respected and looked up to, why is it that I get this sick feeling inside me when Maude sides with me against him, and Mama and Abigail and everybody else in the country busy taking notice of me and all the rest of the Holt family? Should n't I be grateful to my sister for standing up for me, for finding excuses to explain why I was n't doing the things Papa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't making myself into the man he wanted me to fit into the shoes of? But, no, I never could explain it to myself and for sure not to anybody else why it was I never felt like thanking Maude a single time when she did something for me in all those times I did n't satisfy Papa and all those fights I had with him about every little thing he found wrong with me, every little way I was n't being the right and true son for Amos Holt to have. Maude would look at me when I did something that got me in trouble with the man who always had the right word for every occasion, say one of the times when I came in drunk from some play party or busted some piece of harness or forgot to feed some damn mule or another. She would look at me not like she was mad or disappointed or surprised but like she was sorry for me, like she loved me. That was what was always in her eyes when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and comfort me after Papa had punished me however he 'd done for whatever particular offense of mine it was this time. Maude loved me, she forgave me, I was her brother, and that 's what I never could stand about the way she has always treated me. I could n't do anything wrong enough ever to stop her from judging me in that way. How, though, at the same time could I blame her? That is what I 'm talking about when I say it 's like taking something into yourself you believe and know is sweet and good and nourishing, and then discovering when it hits the pit of your stomach that it is poison to the system and must not be let to abide within. That is Maude and her nature and the way it 's been to me all these years to have to live with, the ones when I could see to walk around and want things, and the years I 've spent where the light ca n't reach to show me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another proposition, and always has been, and what she provides and represents I have always been able to handle. I 've even come to like her, though I 'd never let her know that, in a way I 've never been able to like Maude. I do n't like Maude, I never did from my childhood in Amos Holt 's house all the way up to now where I 'm living in her house. But I love her. And that 's what makes me feel sick inside, always on the verge of throwing everything up and having to think all the time, every minute of my life, how to keep going in a way that will let me hold it all down. I do n't tell Maude I love her, and I wo n't. And I do n't tell Abigail I like her, but I do. I love my sister Maude in the way a man loves the air he takes in to let him live and the way he loves the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it, and not having to think about the good it does him. And I like my sister Abigail the way a boxer in the ring likes the man he 's fought who has just beat the living hell out of him. That man who 's whipped him, made him know he 's the lesser in the match, and let him feel down to the bone that he 's not won and can never. That man is owed a debt by the man he 's beat. He has taught him a lesson he needed to know. Abigail does that for me. She keeps me whipped down and mad enough to keep going, and she always has, damn her soul. They 're looking up as I feel my way into Maude 's bedroom, all of them, each one in her own location that she could point to exactly, like it was a place on the map, if somebody asked her to do that. Why, here, she could say, here is where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the rest of them are. Now when they speak to me, and all of them do, even the one dying by slow degrees on her final bed, I can tell where they are, too, more or less, and I know they are all sitting down and in the case of Maude, lying down, and I know they 're looking up at me standing in the door with my head higher than any of theirs. How do I know that, how can I figure the angle at which a man or woman 's aiming words at me, and me blind, somebody might be curious enough to ask? It 's one of the blessings granted me, Abigail would say and has said many a time in my presence, a compensation God gives a blind man, a special development He allows to take place in the hearing of the one who can no longer see. What happens, understand, she will say, is that my brother 's hearing has got so strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're holding your head while you talk to him. Just watch Lewis 's head while he 's hearing what you say to him and you can see him turn it to face you, tracking where the sound is coming from, almost like he 's trying to see the true location of the one speaking to him. You close your eyes and try to do what he 's able to do, and set somebody to watch you while you 're trying it. You wo n't even come close to matching up with him, I guarantee you. Abigail will say that and look around like a banty hen, just daring somebody to contradict her. And explanations such as that are what I 'm talking about when I say enduring a session with my big sister is like getting in the ring with that superior boxer, the one who whales the dickens out of you from far off and from close up, from way across the ring up to right inside in all the clinches. I will say this about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. If that 's the best method God has figured out to improve the sense of hearing in a man, put out his eyes, that is, and teach him to follow vibrations in the air like a dog sniffing at a smell of rot the wind has blown up, God needs to take building lessons from somebody else better equipped. And if what 's going on beneath the surface when a blind man is tracking sound in that fashion is no more than God just dishing out some more punishment for misdeeds and sorry behavior, it is my opinion that God has stepped over the line and needs to be reasoned with. If there was somebody to reason with Him, I mean, and if there was such a thing as reason. But they are all looking up at me from their particular spots here in Maude 's bedroom, and saying hello and asking how I 've slept and if I 've had breakfast and the other things they are supposed to be uttering in the middle of the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I know where each and every one of them is sitting. Pretty much. " Well, Lewis, " Abigail is saying, " I see you 've shaved this morning. " " I have made that my habit over the years, " I say, not swiveling my head in her direction, though I could if I wanted to. She needs to be denied the satisfaction of visiting that tried and true topic for conversation first thing this morning. That one 's too easy. " I do it most every morning. " " How come you never seem to miss a patch of whiskers? " Abigail says. " Just looking real close at your face, I swear I ca n't spot a single place you have n't shaved all the beard off of. Now all of y'all know that an older man like Lewis is now, even if he 's got good eyesight so strong he does n't even need to wear glasses, why he will miss a patch or two of whiskers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time on old fellows. " " I hate seeing that, " Abigail 's granddaughter says, getting her oar into the conversation, " on a man. It looks real ugly and like the man does n't care enough how he looks to people to even do a good job of shaving. " Maude and her granddaughter do n't add anything to this part of the discourse, as they generally do n't when Abigail is just limbering up, but I know where they 're located in the room anyway. Maude 's bed is where it always has been, and she 's not leaving that piece of furniture ever again, it looks like, and Dicia, by a process of elimination, has got to be over in the corner of the room next to the window in that straightback chair sitting up against the wall. " The reason a man misses a patch of whiskers when he 's shaving, Abigail, " I say, turning my head not toward her but toward where I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does n't see it, but because he does n't care. Is n't that right, Dicia? " " I suppose so, Great-uncle Lewis, " she says, not right off, but giving herself time as though she 's according due consideration to what I 've just said. " It depends on the man and the circumstance, I expect. " " That 's right, girl, " I say. " A man who 's got good eyesight does n't have to prove anything to anybody by the way he shaves his face. He 's got seeing ability to spare, and he does n't need to apologize to a soul for anything. All he 's doing is shaving his beard in the morning. He 's not having to show he can be neat and clean, even with his eyes put out, in every little thing he does. Understand what I 'm saying, Dicia? I imagine you do. " " Maybe so, " she says. " But sometimes things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're not trying to prove anything. " " That 's exactly right, " I say. " The man with good eyesight do n't have to prove anything with the way he shaves his face, or the way he does anything else of a domestic nature, neither. He just does it and do n't have to care how anybody looks at it or if anybody looks at it. The blind man, now, has to prove things to people every minute of the day in everything he does. " " You should n't say " do n't " when the subject of your sentence is singular, " Abigail says. " The proper grammar calls for " does n't '. " " See what I 'm saying, Dicia? " I say. " A blind man has got to watch everything, even how he says his sentences, or folks will think less of him. " " You used bad grammar long before you lost your eyesight, " Abigail says, " and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you did know better. You were taught correctly. " At that, Maude speaks up right in the middle of me gathering myself for the next shot at Abigail, and I let that one go for now. " Lewis, " she says, " will you pour me a little water into that glass on the table? I do n't want to have to sit up. " I do that, and I do n't spill a drop, and I put the pitcher back down where it comes from, nobody saying a word but Abigail drawing a quick breath like people do when they see a danger all of a sudden present itself. That does not rattle me. It steadies my hand. " Do you want a chair to sit down in? " Maude says, and I hear Norma Mae get up from where she 's located, seeing the chance to leave the room while kindly giving up her seat to her old blind great-uncle. " Here, " she says, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of something anyway. " " Why, thank you, Norma Mae, " I tell her. " But you got to give me a big old hug first and show me where you 've been sitting. " She is not going to like doing that, I know, hugging up tight to a blind man and him just old kinfolks, but she 'll step on in there and do it, all right, like a little soldier, and the girl is a full-grown woman just come into her prime. Unlike Dicia, who is compact and slim and no matter how close you grab her up to you for a hug, not really there at all because she does n't want to be, Norma Mae pushes right into you, strong arms and high-set breasts and a smell like perfume from a store in Houston. Norma Mae is not really there, either, in her mind, but she lets her body be present for admiration and a touch or two, even if the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. My grandniece, Abigail 's granddaughter Norma Mae, has the heart of a whore, though she 'll probably never use it. I hug her up to me. One thing touches on another one, always, all the time and I 've come to know the truth of that during these years of feeling my way along these walls between me and daylight. That was there for me to learn by sight if I 'd wanted and been willing to look, back then before it happened, but I did n't, of course, care anything then about wasting time doing that. Now I 've had time sufficient and plenty to learn it not by sight but by feel, and that is the surest and most solid way to comprehend any lesson. You get it by touch, and you get it by heart, and it is written in letters carved into stone which you trace in the dark with your finger. It comes into you at a point where the flesh barely covers the bone, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whiskey moves out from the belly to all parts of the body, steady and sure and not to be denied its path. One thing touches another. It is a single wad of string balled up into a knot, and there is no end to take hold of and pluck and no unraveling ever to come. Papa knew that, and he knew that he knew it, because he had learned it on his own. What he came to understand about one thing always touching another confirmed the teachings of the Bible, in the way that Papa saw to be true in his own life. I want to be particular and precise in thinking about this matter, and I do n't want to mislead my own understanding. Papa 's experience confirmed the truth of the matter as explained in the Bible, not the other way around. The prophets and teachers and apostles and Jesus Himself had their statements made true by Amos Holt 's experience in his life in Louisiana and Virginia and Maryland where the Civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up living and dying. Papa did n't have to look to the Book to support his own understanding of what means what in this life. If Jesus and the apostles and the rest of them that put those words into the Bible had had the advantage of foresight into the career of Amos Holt, they could have saved themselves some trouble and a lot of effort and wasted motion. The life he lived and his measuring out of it into portions small enough to bite off, chew up, and worry down allowed him to judge which parts of the Bible to take seriously, which parts to question, and which to just glide right over. He held up the rule to himself, not himself to the rule. It did n't measure him. He measured it. So when they brought me back to the home place in Sabine County after what, happened to me in Beaumont, carrying me in a truck that passed for an ambulance, wobbling all over the roads and hitting every hole in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was floating somewhere about a foot above the rest of me, like it was tied to a thin string frayed and close to snapping, I knew Papa would be waiting in the room where they put me, the Bible in his hand, ready to read out the scriptures that showed how Amos Holt was right on the money about how one thing always touches another. " You are home now, Lewis, " was the first thing Papa said to me where they put me on a bed in a room I could n't see and never would, " The prodigal son has returned, and we will kill the fatted calf. Listen to the word of the Lord. " And that I did, and I did that for over a month right up to the point when one morning I woke up remembering that Papa had been dead for over twenty years. Abigail had been doing all the talking, and I had been listening to her but hearing Papa, and I had been counting it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support for the truths he ladled out to me like soup from a pot never emptied. I could n't escape the sound of his voice and the way the mind will listen to words spoken to it even though you 're telling it not to, but I could n't see his face, at least. I did n't have to reach judgment about the difference between what Amos Holt said aloud and what his countenance told of the feelings behind whatever he said. You ca n't see the dark, only the light. So if and when you say a thing like, " I can see it 's really dark tonight, " you 're speaking nonsense. What 's really the truth is that there 's less light than usual, not more dark. It 's always dark as the pit everywhere all the time, and when you 're able to see something it 's not an absence of darkness coming into your eyes. It 's a relief from it. The night was dark in Beaumont when it happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were walking along Grockett Street looking for the Maryland Hotel that evening. I would n't say it like that now, after learning what I have all these years of touching the wall and reading what it has to say through my fingertips. Maybe instead I 'd say, " Clay, there 's not much light available to us this evening. Be careful, lest all of it leak away. " And then I 'd say to old Clay Whitehead, " One thing touches on another, Clay. Keep that in mind, always. " But, if I 'd had sense enough to know that and to have said anything like it, there 'd have been no occasion to. One thing touches on another, like I 've testified, and that includes every second and minute of time, but time is a snarl of string with no end showing to grab hold of. Pull at one place or another of that rat 's nest of string, and there 's no telling what will rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone, stolen away from me by my own damned nephew Richard, and she had been the only one for me where things were working out between us for more than a month or six weeks in a row. I 'm not talking about some permanent arrangement when I say that, naturally, not that there is such an animal as a permanent arrangement between a man and a woman not kin to each other by blood. That is a whole separate subject and one you ca n't get away from while you still have body and what moves it around yet hanging together. But, Lord, I did love to touch her and look at her hair with the sun on it and the shape of her face when seen from the side. I say Darlene Simmons was stolen from me by Richard Blaekstock, Maude 's only child by that first husband, but I 'm using the wrong word, I admit, when I say stolen. That would be an accurate description of what happened that night when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding up on the porch of Maude 's house and the two of them got that first full look at each other, accurate only if the word stolen would apply to what takes place when a prize possession just walks right through the wall of your house or the fence around it built to keep things in and climbs on the truck itself to be carried off. One thing touches on another, that 's what I 'm pronouncing as a truth learned by moving my fingers over the carvings on the wall between me and the light. So if that lantern held up on that porch in Goushatta County those years ago had not shown two people what it did of each other and what at least one of them thought was wantful and necessary at the time, I 'd not have been on Grockett Street in Beaumont, Texas, looking for the Maryland Hotel not two years later. Maybe. But I was, and I found it, and Clay Whitehead and I walked through that door at the bottom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody and everything in my future was located and waiting to say hello. I had been to the Maryland before, and that was why I wanted to find it again. It 's not hard to find things in Beaumont, Texas, so the search I was undergoing should have been an easy one, but I was, naturally, drunk the first time I 'd been there and was being led by somebody else. So finding the Maryland hotel the second time was a satisfaction to me, and I was the man leading the way on this occasion, and for some reason that was a cheering notion to me. We went up the stairs at a trot, me and Clay, and I pulled the string that made the bell on the other side of the door ring hard enough to make it jangle like it was about to come unnailed from the wall. I have to make myself remember exactly the way that string looked hanging out there waiting to be tugged at, and I can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grab it. When a man is blind, he has plenty of time to call up the way light once fell for him on most any object at almost any time. When you can see, you do n't really care what the light shows exactly about most things you happen to let your eyes move over. You just waste all that light touching things in the way a man at the end of a meal, cropful of food, will throw away the last bite of steak on his plate or the crust left after eating a slice of pie. It 's more coming, he thinks, if he thinks at all, and I do n't need to give these leavings any scrap of my attention. The string to the bell of the Maryland was about a foot long, what you could see of it hanging before you ; it had been broken by some fool anxious to get inside with all those women, and it had been tied back together in a granny knot. It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands grabbing at it, and it was the last piece of string I ever saw. Going into a whorehouse always made me feel two ways at once, from the first time I visited right up to the last. The first way was what might be expected-all wound up and nervous and excited and popeyed to see women ready and willing to crawl into bed with you with their clothes off. Any man working in the oilfields and shipyards around Beaumont or Orange or Port Arthur would agree with that understanding of the way you felt when that eye looked at you through the hole cut in the door where you 'd just rung the bell and then the eye went away and the unlocking and opening up took place. But I never heard anybody talk about the other feeling that door opening caused, the one opposite from being all keyed up enough to walk across broken glass in stocking feet and not notice the cost of a single cut nor one drop of blood drawn. And that feeling to me was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling that comes on you akin to water seeping and rising and beginning to lift you off your feet, or the way the second drink of whiskey takes hold and you start feeling it in the tops of your thighs and in the muscles of your neck. What I felt like each time I walked into a whorehouse, apart from the sense of something good happening low and deep in my belly, was the same way I would feel when I was paying the bill at the end of a cooked meal in a caf or restaurant in a town where nobody knew me. I had done a job of work, I had been paid for it, I had the money in my pocket to show it, and I had not had to see the meat and potatoes and beans and bread I had eaten planted and cultivated and raised and slaughtered and picked and cooked and brought to the table. I had had no part in any of the preparation. It came complete. I had just to point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the counter and say I 'll take that. Then they had brought it to me to eat, and I 'd paid for it with dollars out of my pocket, and we were settled up. Nothing was left to consider. The same way obtained in a place where women were selling what I wanted for straight cash on the table. I had n't seen a one of them before, including the one I ended up following out of the big room down the hall to one of the little rooms with a bed and washstand in it, and I 'd never had to talk to them before, or during, or since, if I did n't feel like it. And yet they would treat me the same, no matter how we talked or did n't or would n't. They 'd take my two dollars, put it up somewhere, pull their clothes off, crawl into bed, and put their legs up. Knowing that was coming was what gave me that feeling, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around a mare in heat. I was relaxed, relieved, ready to do business, and I did n't have to say a word. So when we popped through that door of the Maryland hotel on Crockett Street in Beaumont that February night, I was ready to see what I could, and I was n't thinking much about Darlene Simmons for the first time in a while, and I could feel the sense of water seeping in around me and beginning to lift my feet from where they were planted on solid ground. I was about to float. I was almost tiptoeing, walking across that flowered rug in the big room to sit down on a sofa up against the far wall and wait to see the women come traipsing in with what they had to sell. " What y'all do for a living? " the colored woman who 'd let me and Clay Whitehead in the door said. " Work in a insurance office? " " Why you think that? " Clay said. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Way y'all dressed, " the woman said. " Them nice duds. " " Nah, " Clay said. " We just like to dress up a little when we go out for some fun. You not going to find us sitting behind a desk in a office somewhere. " " We like to work in the open air, " I said, helping Clay make conversation with the woman as I looked around the room. The first thing that caught my attention was a Victrola in one corner with a woman bent over it doing something to its knobs, making it ready to start playing, I guessed, since there was n't any sound coming out of the machine. Her dress was short, way above her knees, and split up the back, and as she bent farther over to move something on the Victrola, I could see she was n't wearing any underclothes. Just as I saw that, the sound of a musical instrument came out of the Victrola, a trumpet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hips back and forth in rhythm to it, still bending over as she did that. " Good God, " I said, loud enough to cause Clay to stop in the middle of something he was saying to the colored woman who 'd let us through the door to the Maryland Hotel. " I believe we come to the right place. Look up way underneath and deep inside yonder. That thing looks like a skinned rabbit trying to back out of a hollow stump. " I figured that would get Clay 's notice, pussy hound as he always was, so I just kept my attention focused on what I saw in front of me and waited to hear what Clay would come back at me with. He would always try to outdo the other fellow, top whatever 'd been said with something better of his own. Sometimes Clay could, sometimes he could n't. He would take a stab at it, though. But before he could get anything said back to me, somebody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Velma? " I had missed seeing him when we came through the door into the Maryland Hotel, paying attention as I was to the colored woman letting us in, and besides that he was sitting across the room from where the whore was messing with the Victrola, and I had n't looked anywhere but in her direction. He was dark complected enough to be colored himself, but the light was bright in the room, the better for customers to see the women by, I guess, and I could tell by his features he was a white man, though probably a Cajun. " I did n't say nothing to nobody, " I said. " I was just remarking on that wad of hair I see moving back and forth over yonder. " " You ai n't been here what-two minutes? -and you already lowrated Velma twice like that. " He was sitting back in a straight chair when I first saw him, but now he leaned forward so that the chair legs hit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have sounded so loud and made Clay Whitehead jump like he did if the rug in the room had been bigger and could have covered more of the wood floor. The man rubbed the back of his hand against his chin as though he was wiping something off his mouth left over from chewing a bite of something greasy and too big to get all of down in one swallow. " I do n't know her, " I said, jerking my head toward the woman he 'd called Velma, now standing straight up beside the Victrola, her head turned to look over her shoulder. " I was just talking about what all I could see when she was bending over that music machine. " " Her name 's Velma, " the fellow said, moving his head from side to side like his neck was stiff, " It ai n't " skinned rabbit, " and it ai n't " wad of hair. ' " He moved his head slow, like his neck was bothering him bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said, " what I could see of it. I was n't trying to call her name. " " Her pussy, " he said, like it was a question he was asking, " her pussy? Where you from, friend? " " Hardin County, " Clay Whitehead said, as though the man talking to me actually wanted to know the location of my home. " That 's where Lewis is from. Me, I 'm from Orange, Texas. " " Hardin County, " the Cajun-looking man said, " That makes sense. It 's coming together for me now. What do you peckerwoods use for women up in them woods? Shoats? " " Dane, " the woman by the Victrola said. " We 're in business here. You know that, and I want you to think about it. " " You heard what this peckerwood called you, Velma. Did n't you hear that? Have you lost your hearing, too, along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knob on the Victrola and it made the music get louder. Somebody on the record was singing along with the music, and I could tell he was colored, but I could n't make out what words he was saying, even though it was the same ones over and over. " He did n't mean nothing against this lady here, " Clay said. " Lewis did n't. Did you, Lewis? " I tried to say no, but words would n't come out the first time, so I cleared my throat and did it again. It worked that second time, my mouth did. " No, " I said. " No, I sure did n't. " " You got to give a man some leeway with what he says, " the colored woman said to the man called Dane, though she was not looking at him, but at me. " A man come in that door from way up yonder in one of them counties in East Texas, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying things he ai n't thought through yet. Ai n't that right? " " Yes, ma'am, " I said, even though she was n't a white woman. " Yes, ma'am. " " Well, " Velma said, and looked at me. " You going to want to do anything about it this evening? You want to take a little walk down that hall yonder? " I looked over at Dane, who had settled back into his chair again, far enough to let the front legs rest again on the floor, and he was not looking at anybody now, his eyes closed in fact, and his mouth drawn up as though he was whistling a tune under his breath. I remember thinking that he was probably imitating the music of the song coming from the Victrola and probably knew what words the colored singer was saying, the ones he was repeating over and over, every one of them. " I sure would, " I said, looking back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll show you where that rabbit lives, " she said. " Back in here behind all that underbrush. Come on now, Hardin County. " Clay Whitehead laughed at Velma saying that, giving it a lot more credit for being funny than it deserved, but I knew he thought he had a good reason for doing it. I appreciated what clay was trying to do by giving the woman 's words the acknowledgment he did, but nobody else joined in with him, and that made the room seem quieter than if he had n't laughed any at all or made any other sound. I followed right behind Velma into the hall, not close enough to touch her but wanting to get as quick as I could out of the room where the man called Dane was sitting in a straightback chair with his eyes closed, rolling his head back and forth. Leaving the room, I did n't look at him, nor at anybody else, just kept my eyes fixed on the spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin began, dead white against the dark hank of hair bouncing on it. I do n't remember following her into one of the rooms off the hall, but I do know it was the end of the corridor because it seemed to take a long time to get there. Once we got inside, Velma did what whores always did back then and still do, I guess, told me to take my clothes off, shucked her dress in less time than it takes to tell about it, and then took a long look at my pecker, holding it up and squeezing it to see if anything suspicious came out or if I flinched like it hurt. Then she washed it with soap and water from the jug on the stand by the bed, and I was surprised by what happened to me when she did that, which was nothing. Always before in a whorehouse when a woman handled me, I 'd get hard while she was doing it without even thinking about whether I was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished, it was showing no more interest in what had been going on than if I 'd just taken a short leak through it. She did n't say anything at first, nor look me in the face, but of course a whore never does that. Even if she has her eyes on you, you can tell she 's looking through you, not at what 's in front of her, the man about to climb on. " Well, " I said, " that 's never happened to me before, " and then I reached for one of her tits, but she put her hand up to keep me away from them, and then she looked at me. " Not for two dollars, " she said. " That 's not part of the deal. You do n't handle my breasts for that. " " What if I give you another dollar? " I said. " Then can I get my hands on them? " " No, " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might offer me. Nobody plays with me like that, but just the one man. " I figured I knew who she was talking about, but I did n't ask her his name. Instead, I just reached out for her belly and ran my fingers down until I found what I was paying for. " All right, " Velma said, looking at me again but this time not letting her eyes see me, " let 's lie down on this bed and see what happens. " By the time we got situated, I could tell it had got over whatever was holding it back, and I was able to start in putting it to work on what I had come there for. Velma did n't say anything while it was going on, like some whores will do and like some men like to hear. All that talk about how it 's feeling so good to them, and how fine you are giving them what they need, and they never had it like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have something to look forward to that another man ca n't give them and never has before. That 's all lies, and if a man can get some satisfaction from that, not even to say believe it, that 's all to the good, I suppose, but I never liked hearing that from one of them. Just keep your mouth shut and let me get to where I want to go. That was my policy. We finished up with it, and got up off the bed, and she gave me a rag to clean myself off with, and that 's when it came into my head to do what I did, while I was watching her hold out that wet cloth toward me, looking at my face like she was doing, but actually staring right through me toward some spot on the wall behind my head, I figured, some place she thought was better to study than me. A crack in the paint, maybe, or a nail hole, or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoe. I grabbed her by one of her tits, it was her left one, I know, because I was facing her and I 'm righthanded, and I squeezed it hard enough to feel my thumb opposed by my fingers through the flesh. " I told you not to do that, " the whore said and knocked at my hand with hers, " Do n't touch my breast. " " What about this one, then? " I said, the idea coming into my head to say that like it was automatically given to me, something I did n't even have to think to be able to come up with, and then I reached out for the other one and squeezed it harder than I had that first one. She hit that hand, too, my left one, but slower than she 'd done the right one, and then she stepped back and looked directly into my eyes, seeing me this time, I could tell, as she settled her eyes direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " she said, slow and deliberate. " Do n't come back here again. Not ever. " " Oh, Velma, " I said, trying to make my voice playful as I looked into her eyes, " did n't I just give you the time of your life on that bed over yonder? Did n't you just fall in love with me when I did you so good? " " Do n't call me Velma, " she said. " The only name you get to call me is whore. That 's the one you paid for. Now you get the hell out of here. " By the time I had put my clothes and shoes back on and had got back down the hall to the room we first came into, Velma was already out there, standing close to where the Gajun-looking man, Dane, was sitting in his straightback chair, and looking down at him. He had a beer bottle in his hand and had drunk about half of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth, as though something had interrupted his train of thought and he had forgot to finish the action of taking another drink from the bottle. Six or seven other people had come into the room since I had left to go with Velma down the hall, four of them customers, I guessed, and the other ones new women looking to make a sale. I did n't see clay Whitehead anywhere, and I started looking around for him, thinking as I did that if he were to suddenly appear before me I would knock hell out of him for not being there ready to leave when I got back. But, I could n't do that, since he was n't there, and if he had been there 'd be no reason to feel like doing that to him. You want to do what you ca n't do when there 's no reason to do it if you could. " Where 's clay? " I said to nobody in particular, speaking out loud, almost yelling so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victrola, which somebody had turned up high, and the talking going on between the whores and the men trying to get up the nerve to do some serious bargaining with them. " Where 's the fellow that came in here with me? Has he done left? " " You talking about that little fellow wearing them big red-colored boots, he gone back in the room with Dolly, " the colored woman who had let us in the Maryland hotel said. " He might be a while, too. Dolly she twice as big as he is. " " Suppose she going to have to hold him up to it? " said one of the new men in the room, looking from me to the colored woman and back again. " So he 'll have a fighting chance to hang that thing in her? " The rest of them laughed big at that, though not any of the whores did, and I joined in, too, as I began to work my way toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " Tell him I 'll be outside waiting, " I said to the spot where the colored woman had been, though she was not there now, and I turned to look back toward the corner of the room where the whore I had been with was talking with the man in the straightback chair. The chair was there, and Velma was there looking down at the seat of it as though there might have been somebody still sitting there saying something to her. But there was n't. The man she called Dane was not in sight, and seeing that chair empty was like feeling cold air moving across my face on a hot day in August. I could get my full breath. I fumbled the lock open on the room side of the door, and I was halfway down the stairs before I heard it slam behind me. It seemed to me that somebody must have turned out the light bulb in the stairway because I remembered it being easy to see the steps when clay Whitehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now it was so dark I could n't see my feet in front of me as I came in a half run down, down, down toward the square of light in the door at the bottom leading to the street. The quiet on the stairway got so different so quick when the door to the Maryland hotel at the top had slammed shut between me and the noise of the Victrola and the whores and the customers, so different in my ears, that the absence of sound seemed loud to me. My head was roaring with a noise like a big wind blowing through cedars in a cemetery somewhere, and I could n't get outside the building fast enough to suit me. I ran at the door at the bottom with my arms lifted to knock it open, and I stumbled on the threshold on the way out, half falling as my feet hit the concrete sidewalk. That stumble was why when he swung the hand holding the knife at me he did n't catch me with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temple, lodging it so hard in the bone that it twisted out of his hand when I went down to the pavement. And I heard a click when that steel hit bone, though I never felt it as a pain but as the sound of a thing shutting off, the way a radio will when you twist the knob and the music and the talking stop coming out, and the light in the tubes that make it run dims down to nothing and winks out. I could n't see anything of where I was, anymore. But I 've found where the light is now, though I ca n't see it, and I do n't need it to tell me where things have got off to and where they touch and where they finally are. Everything is right there, just outside me and behind that wall, and I can stand in this room, not one hand having to feel the facing of the door to tell me the direction where I need to turn my head so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed waiting to die. " I 'd like a little more water, " she 's saying. " Lewis, could you pour me a little in my glass? " " Sure, Sister, " I say, reaching out to touch the smooth cool glass and the pitcher beside it on the table. I pour the water all the way to the top, not spilling any of it, and hold the glass toward the place in all that empty air where her hand has to be. It 's there, it always is, and I never miss.
