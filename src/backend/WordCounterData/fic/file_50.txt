1007941 She just knew that Matt was n't capable of doing anything so horrible. <p> Deanna heard her brother Matt slam the car door shut as she searched through her backpack for yesterday 's homework. She looked up in time to see him dash between two cars and head for the main entrance to Brockville High. She scrambled to get out of the car in time to catch up with him, but it was too late. That 's funny, she thought to herself Matt always waits for me. Deanna shrugged and guessed that he had to be in class early, or he had something special to give to his girlfriend. Lately his whole life seemed to be obsessed with her. Deanna strolled slowly toward the double glass doors, the entrance to " prison, " as she laughingly called them. R-i-n-g! the bell sounded as she reached for the handle. " Oh, no! " she muttered. " Late again. " She quickly walked to her locker that was only two away from Matt 's. As he was putting books into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacket onto the top shelf Then he shut the door and ran off to class, not even noticing that Deanna stood there with a terrified look on her face. Her mind was fixed on what he had just put in his locker. It could n't have been what she thought it was. It just could n't. The halls were empty now ; everyone was in class, but Deanna did n't care that she was late. She had to find out what it was that Matt had put in his locker. She tried to open it. Sometimes the lockers would open if you hit them just right. She banged on it, but no luck. She tried standing on her tiptoes to see inside the small slits at the top of the locker door, but she was n't tall enough. Her mind began racing. What should I do? What if it 's really not what I think it is? Then she remembered what she 'd seen the night before. Dad and Mom had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sound coming from their bedroom, she went to investigate. The door was cracked open, and the light was on. Probably Matt, she 'd thought as she pushed the door slightly. Matt was standing near the closet door holding Dad 's handgun. " Matt! " Deanna had exclaimed in shock. " What are you doing in here? " " I was looking for something, " Matt had said quickly, putting the gun back on the shelf in the closet where he 'd found it. " I was n't playing with it. Please do n't tell Dad or Mom, OK? " Deanna made a face as if to say that she did n't agree. " You have to promise. I do n't tell them all that you do, so do me a favor, or next time I wo n't help you when you need it. " " Fine, " Deanna had said and stormed out of the room. She had n't really thought much about it at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his locker, she was afraid. Could that really have been a gun? Why would Matt do such a thing? Deanna shook her head. No, he would n't bring a gun to school. That 's just not like him at all. She reluctantly went to class. Her homeroom teacher was talking about tardiness just as she walked in. " And here 's a prime example : Miss Deanna Carlson. You may take a seat afte taking a tardy slip. " Mrs. Walker " voice was as harsh as ever. She held out a small pink piece of paper. Deanna snatched it from her hands and plopped down at her desk. She felt a tap on her shoulder. Turning around, Mind, the school 's queen of gossip, whispered, " I ca n't believe that Matt got dumped by Kelli. " Deanna just stared dumbfounded. " Oh, did n't you know? I thought you 'd be the first to know, since you 're his sister and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period. Why had n't Matt told her? Her heart started racing when she remembered the gun. Could Matt have brought that to school out of anger? Deanna shook her head. No way. She thought about all of the recent school shootings where students had brought in guns to school and others were hurt or killed. She just knew that Matt was n't capable of doing something so horrible. But then again, no one ever suspected any of those kids at the other schools either. " May I be excused? " The look on Mrs. Walker 's face told her the answer was no. " Please, Mrs. Walker, it 's an emergency, I promise. " Mrs. Walker sighed and pointed at the hall pass. Deanna quickly grabbed it and headed to the school office. She had no idea what to do. If he really did bring a gun to school, he would be expelled or maybe even sent to jail. That was the last thing Deanna wanted. Matt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell, there could be a horrible tragedy, and it would be partly her fault for not telling. Sitting down on a bench in the hallway, Deanna 's mind was swimming with confusion. I have to tell somebody, but who? she thought. Dad! If anyone would understand, it would be Dad. The school office was quiet but busy. There were too many people who could possibly overhear the conversation. She knocked on the office door of Mr. Anderson, one of the school counselors. " Come in, " a deep voice called. " Excuse me, Mr. Anderson, but may I use your phone? It 's kind of a private situation, " she asked timidly. " Of course, " he answered. Mr. Anderson took a couple of files with him as he left the room. Deanna shut the door quietly. Her stomach felt as though it was going to flip. Punching the numbers on the phone, she waited for her dad to answer. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " Dad? " " Deanna, baby, what 's up? Are n't you supposed to be in class? " " Dad, this is important. Please do n't freak out or anything. " " Are you in trouble? " Dad asked with a worried voice. " No, no, not me. It 's Matt. I saw him put something into his locker, and I think it might have been your handgun, but I 'm not sure. " There was silence on the other line. Tears started swelling in her eyes as she tried to speak. " Please d-do n't be mad, but I saw him looking at it last night. I promised him I would n't tell... " " Baby, it 's OK. I 'll go home right now to see if the gun is in the closet. Give me your phone number there, and I 'll call you as soon as I check. " Deanna slumped down onto a chair and buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best thing, but it sure felt like the worst. She hoped and prayed that it was n't a gun Matt had put in his locker. " Not Matt... " she muttered to herself The clock on the wall ticked on. It seemed to echo in the dreadful silence. Deanna watched the phone, willing it to ring. She tried not to think about what would happen if Dad 's gun was missing. Images of her brother being kicked out of school, of being locked behind bars, hit Deanna like a kick in the stomach. If this happened, Matt would never forgive her. Finally the phone rang. Deanna jumped up and grabbed the receiver. This was it-the moment of truth. " Dad? " " Yeah, it 's me. " " So, was it there? " " Yes, baby. Yes, it 's here. " " Oh, I 'm so glad. Dad, please do n't tell Matt that I suspected anything, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I wo n't. Now you 'd better get back to class, " he reminded in a more cheery tone as he hung up. Deanna sat back in the chair, closed her eyes, and took a deep breath. She smiled and thought, I made the right decision.
