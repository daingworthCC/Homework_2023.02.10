4121941 I 'm divorced. It went through last month. I still wonder why it came to that, but it seemed the next stop after separating. And she wanted it. For a year I 've been living in a three-room unit at the Umbrian Villages on the edge of the actual village where we raised our kids. Now Orvieto, Perugia, and Assisi sit on a broad hilltop over Route 128 north of Boston. I remember when it once was someone 's decrepit dairy farm. <p> Violet Evelyn Smith loves hearing how things used to be-old farms, fewer people. She 's in her middle thirties, not much older than my two kids. She just moved in across what they call our piazza. Our village is Assisi. Last week I saw her disappear behind her blue door carrying a heavy carton. Later I encountered her at our mailbox arcade. She gave me a firm handshake. " I 'm Violet Evelyn Smith, " she said. I responded with " Christopher Parish or just plain Chris. " " Then make me Vi, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the whoosh of traffic on the highway below. I assured her she 'd get used to it. Somehow I knew she was a lesbian, which did n't stop me from finding her attractive. She 's the adorable jock girl I 've always considered my type. I 'm sixty-three, and she 's still my type. <p> But years ago I married Alexandra Markopoulos. Xan is skinny and looks frail. She is n't actually frail. She 's wiry and indestructible but dark and short and small. And I 'm the lanky sort with knobby knees. I was a runner once in high school and for a while in college. I was n't Xan 's type either. She preferred short men she could look directly in the eye, men with meat on their bones. I 'd wrap myself around her skinniness and yearn for more hip, more bosom, more weight. I 'm sure even then she missed some things in me too. <p> Yesterday evening I got talking again with Vi in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. She gets back from her job at the Nursery about the time I trudge up the hill from work. I 'm at the Worldtime Project down in the office park. Violet seemed curious about our website, so I invited her over to my place to show her how it operates. I 've been with Worldtime for years, ever since I quit teaching to come edit high school history texts. It 's a different kind of company now. It 's an animated historical atlas you can subscribe to online. You can start and stop it anywhere in time or geography, zoom it in or out. You can speed it up and watch boundaries zigging about or slow it down so you hardly notice the changes. I am by far the oldest person on the team. They 've kept me on to do the informational sidebars and validate the research. I 'm not a programmer. I do n't understand what those people do. They do n't seem particularly interested in the actual world, past or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yesterday I had been back in the 1860s when Paraguay set out to conquer Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina. It was a hopeless cause lost from the start. " All things eventually come down to lost causes, " I told Violet Evelyn Smith as we sauntered across the flagstones of the Assisi piazza. <p> She followed me inside my green door and up the narrow stairs. I sat her down at my desktop in the living room, pulled up a kitchen chair alongside, and asked her to select a corner of the world. " How about the Balkans, " she said, " because I do n't know what they are exactly. " I thought of old Aunt Marina Markopoulos up in New Hampshire whose parents were born in Macedonia - Greek Macedonia, of course. I typed " Balkan Peninsula " into the machine. Vi did n't know what year to start from, so I typed " 1453 " and there it was, the Ottomans taking Constantinople. Then boundaries kept moving. There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turks were at the gates of Vienna. Vi was watching the dark boundary lines enclosing the re-forming blobs of different colors. " Note the difference between Slavonians and Slovenians, " I said. She gave me a charmingly puzzled glance. It was so pleasant sitting by her side, leaning in slightly to pick up her scent. I watched her soft eyes staring into the blue of the Danube. It would be the Donau if I 'd clicked on German for the language. <p> I sped up to 1686. " Hungary 's coming back, " I pointed out. Things started changing fast. Soon Napoleon was sweeping through and then came the Austro-Hungarian Empire. " Nice graphics, " said Vi. But now the Balkans were splintering again. 1914, 1918- " What the hell 's the Serb-Croat-Slovene Kingdom? " Vi asked, having trouble pronouncing it. But before I could answer her it became Yugoslavia and she said, " Oh yeah. " 1939 : Italy takes Albania. I paused the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First. There he was, the funny-looking little guy no one believed was a real king. I read aloud : " He retreated to a mansion in Syosset, Long Island, that he had to give up for unpaid taxes. " <p> Then I showed Vi how to click on flags, populations, alliances. I took her right up to now, 2007, Montenegro out on its own again, Kosovo possibly soon. " So this is what you do, Chris, " said Vi still puzzling, " all the random stuff you must know! " Of course she knows random stuff too, but she does n't know it 's random yet. To someone of my age it 's all an unsettling patchwork. Patterns I once perceived have gone blurry. There are too many patches, too many stitches. It will only get worse. <p> " So this is what you do, " Vi said again, having let it sink in. I logged off. She swiveled the desk chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye. " I like to call it World Enough and Time, " I said. She did n't catch the reference. I suppose I 'd already begun thinking of her as my coy mistress. I always fill my head with impossibilities. <p> This condo I 'm renting has a living room/study, a kitchenette/dining room, and up another flight a bedroom with a very fluorescent bathroom. There 's a small " loggia " off the living room that looks out over the back side of Perugia with its silent campanile. Xan approves of my having chosen Assisi, for the sake of Saint Francis and the animals. I have no idea who lives on the other side of my walls. <p> When I used to edit textbooks for the original Worldtime Company I 'd walk the two miles here from our old house in the actual village. Sometimes I even used to jog it. It 's been decades since I ran track, and now I have to preserve my knees. Violet Evelyn Smith told me she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charity runs now for women 's causes. She broke up with her girlfriend Gretchen in July. That 's why she moved into Assisi. Theoretically we have a lot in common. <p> I like to imagine my defunct marriage on Worldtime. The boundary moves back and forth in the disputed territory between Christopher and Alexandra. Matthew breaks off and federates with Vanessa Hu. Emma keeps forming shaky alliances with an Ethan or a Noah. I could provide sidebars, but where to start? I 'd have to go back at least to my first birthday, the week we dropped the A bombs on Japan. I was a war baby, my father was still in the Pacific. There were only my mother and aunt and grandmother at home, my women. As soon as you 're born you start learning things. <p> Xan called. That 's her voice on the answering machine. She starts in about a bedraggled little spaniel, a mangy calico. I do still love my ex- wife in many ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let human cruelty get her down. With our old house finally sold she 's bought herself a small cottage up near the shore. Now she 's closer to her shelter. Neither of us has much of a commute anymore. I just walk down the hill. Should I call her back? <p> I 'm not like Xan. She takes poor little pups with cigarette burns and convinces them to trust her. It 's in her voice, in her eyes, in the touch of her fingers. We got married when I was beating the draft by teaching history at the village high school. I stumbled into the job instead of going home to my parents in Mission, Kansas. Eventually Xan showed up at school as a substitute biology teacher. Pretty soon we were living together in a sagging old fixer-upper. We painted it ourselves inside and out. We did some major carpentering. We had our Greek Orthodox wedding up in Haverhill for her parents ' sake. We went on and had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school and took the editing job. When Em got to kindergarten Xan started volunteering up at the shelter. <p> If I call her back it might only start something. She 's just checking in. No, I wo n't call. I 'm meeting Vi at the taquera down the hill. She gets out of therapy at 6:30. It 's a hot enough evening for shorts. Can she take my spindly legs? Maybe she 'll have her running shorts on or the baggies she wears at the Nursery. She 'll have dirt under her fingernails. I notice everything about her. <p> It 's a leisurely stroll down to the old strip mall beside the office park. There she is, Vi, in a short skirt and blouse shutting the door of her little pickup and beeping the lock. " Hi there, neighbor, " I say. <p> She pats my shoulder and says, " Thanks for showing up, Chris. " She may have been crying. She 's told me her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at the chalkboard menu above the grill. " Did you finish with - what did you say it was, Paraguay? " <p> She remembered. Soon we sit down with her quesadillas and my chimichanga. I find this young woman truly beautiful, the soft tanned skin and gray eyes, the tender lips. Is it just me getting old? Does n't every woman her age pretty much look beautiful? <p> " How was the doc? " I ask. <p> " She made some reasonable arguments. " <p> " I did n't think therapists were supposed to argue. " Maybe that was n't helpful. <p> " Yeah, she 'll say what 's on her mind, " says Vi, then with a half smile she shrugs her shoulders. So I reach across to touch the hand that holds the fork with the bite of dripping cheesy quesadilla, and she adds, " More than fucking Gretchen ever would. Did your Xan? " <p> " She 'd say it usually. Too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did n't see it coming either? " <p> I 'm watching Vi 's white plastic fork dip down, stab, and rise again to her smoothly kissable unlipsticked lips. " I should 've, " I say. " I never thought it actually would. " So I reel off some of Xan 's quibbles, how I did n't separate the recyclables correctly and rolled up the windowshades unevenly and mixed soup spoons with dessert spoons in the drawer. Not that any of that was really it, but I do n't intend to go into the worse stuff. <p> So Vi tells me, " Gretchen had her special soaps and lotions specifically for her. Her skin 's very dry and pale and needs extra care, but mine 's oilier, she claims, and I should be using specific products. My therapist wants me to get beyond all this boring rehash and move on. " <p> I 'm looking into her gray eyes, no blue in them under these fluorescent lights. She shrugs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chimichanga I must 've been swallowing. It 's strangely comforting to be this close to someone so desirable yet so unattainable. There 's nothing to lose. I do n't have to put on a show. It 's like back in first grade before the boys had to stick together. You could have a girl for a special friend. <p> " So? " says Vi. <p> " Do I have to say something? " <p> " About yourself. It 's not all about me. " <p> " Your doc 's right, " I say. " Rehashing does n't help. Once I got to Assisi I did n't look back. I decided I 'd never move again. I put all my own stuff in order and sat down on my new couch and said this is it for the rest of my life. " <p> " Uh-oh. " <p> " What? Is that bad? " I 'd lived in that sagging old house more than thirty years. This one move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Well, I refuse to die in this shithole condo, Christopher. It 's like plywood covered with Tyvek and some laminate to look like stucco. It 's ridiculous. And way expensive. If it was n't for my dad helping - but I 've got a one-year sublet then I 'm out of here. " <p> " Whereas I took an option to buy. " <p> " Uh-oh. " <p> " When I get the finances in order. " <p> Vi gives me a sympathetic look, intimate as if we really know each other now. " I suppose time feels different to you, " she says. <p> " At sixty-three. " <p> She presses her lovely tan-brown hand to her breastbone and says almost flirting, " As opposed to thirty-six. " <p> A gulp is coming up my throat. I swallow and say, " When I was thirty-six Matt and Em were small - second grade, kindergarten - and Xan was volunteering at the shelter and bringing puppies home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. It was hard on them. Finally we agreed to adopt a one-year-old bassett named Beverly. Her first owners gave her up because she howled and stank. Then someone else adopted her but brought her back the next week. Xan set up a bath routine and Bev did n't howl as much. She 'd start, but Em would come running and hug her tight or Matt would drag her out to the yard. The poor dog needed attention. Xan 's patient with animals. " <p> " I 'd like to see this Xan of yours to psych her out, " says Vi. <p> " I 'd like to see this Gretchen. " <p> " Thankfully she 's gone back to Seattle. " <p> " You 'd probably end up liking Xan. Everyone does. " <p> We continue assessing the ladies in our previous lives until it 's time to go. " You hoofed it down? " Vi asks. " I better give the old feller a lift up the hill. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Villages. I watch Vi stretch her nicely browned arm out the driver 's window. She 's pointing at the tiny orange and yellow flowers poking out of the grass by the side of the road. They 're lit by the setting sun. " Hawkweed and Indian paintbrush, " she says. " When this was a farm like you said I bet they popped up all summer long. " <p> I see a colorful patch on my side too. I doubt if I noticed them on my walk down. <p> " I 'm a big fan of wildflowers, " Vi says. " I 'm the bad girl at the Nursery. I 'm even a big fan of weeds. Appreciate them now, Chris, before old Mussolini mows them down with his tractor. " <p> " That 's what you call him? " <p> " The big bald Italian guy. You know who I mean. Him. " <p> " Oh, him, yes, " I say. <p> She parks her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piazza. <p> I have n't been entirely honest with Vi. I told her about when I was thirty-six but not about when I was forty-five. Xan and I got through it. She confessed first, so then I could n't not also confess. I could n't pretend to be the only faithful one. I told her about Amy. It was mostly an obsession. We did sleep together in a few motel rooms on a couple of afternoons. Then it was only a correspondence. I 'm sure it was not as satisfying as Xan 's big affair. Dan actually fell in love with her and tried to coax her away. Xan even considered it. But Amy liked the limitations. I was helping her over a rough patch. <p> I 'm sitting out in the loggia. It 's my outdoor room with one wall missing. I 'm glad for the sunset behind Perugia 's square bell tower. I do n't see a soul over there. They 're all inside, air-conditioned, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's turned cool. The manila folder of Amy 's letters is on my lap. She wrote to my office address on her own company 's stationery. The business envelopes look so unromantic. <p> Xan never read these letters. I offered, but she did n't want to. When I said it was over she trusted me and did n't want to know the details. She wanted to know if I could trust her now. I said I could. I did even more than before. It was all out in the open. Dan was gone by then. We had our safe home back. So we did all right after Dan and Amy, then we fell apart because of nothing I could see, because of time passing. <p> I have n't read these letters in years. They 've been in my file drawer with old tax returns. <p> " Dearest Christopher, you 've been so understanding and so wonderful. You gave me what I needed, as I hope I did for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I feel bad sometimes for your sake, but you have such equanimity. The things we said to each other we really meant but knew we could n't keep meaning them forever, just for then. That was sort of wonderful too, was n't it? I do n't suppose most people would be satisfied - " <p> Why did I pull out this one? I 'll try again. <p> " Chris, Chris, Chris, and more Chris! Was n't it crazy of us? Was n't it nicer than we ever imagined? I 'm of the opinion that it 's what every marriage needs. It was like, ' Oh yeah! This is what it used to be, wow! Remember when we did n't really know each other yet? ' Like that, huh? Can I ever find that again with Tom? Oh Chris, Chris, why do people get tired of things once they 've had them for a while? Our couples counselor keeps wanting us to work at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage. Nobody really wants to. Work at love, work at sex, come on, it should n't be work. Should it? I wonder how much having sex is connected to- " <p> No, I ca n't read these. Amy went back and worked at it. That 's all I know. With me it was n't work. It just was n't. I never thought of it as work. Maybe I should have. But I did want to be with Xan. <p> There 's the phone inside. It might be Xan again. I wo n't wait for the message. I step through the open slider and flop on the couch and lift the receiver before the beep. <p> " Daddy. " <p> " Em, it 's you. " <p> " I really need to come talk, " she says. She 's breathing hard. " I 'm actually at your taquera because I did n't have time to eat at work. So I 'm heading up. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm leading such a frantic life. " <p> " Calm down, sweetie. " <p> " I 'm ordering a chimichanga to go. Want one? " <p> " Had one already, but bring yours and I 'll pour you a Corona. " <p> We still have a quarter hour of sunset to watch. Now the red glow spills over Em 's anxious face and softens it. She 's as frail-looking as her mother. I think of her as genuinely frail because she 's my daughter. She 's elongated like me, sort of a medieval saint who needs more flesh on her bones. Food does n't stick to Em. She had an awkward string-bean adolescence. Here we sit now on two moulded plastic chairs like people all over the world at this time of evening. <p> " How 's your new neighbor? " Em asks. <p> " I thought you needed to talk. " <p> " I 'll get to that, " says Em. " I like thinking of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't your brother tell you she 's a lesbian? " <p> " Women 's sexuality is sometimes fluid, " says Em. <p> " Oh? Now which of your men friends are you having trouble with? " <p> " Neither. No, it 's about work, Daddy. I 'm on a total freakout case. Ethan 's very un-understanding about time commitments. Not that he has any free time either. " <p> " So it 's Ethan. " <p> " No, Daddy, it 's about not having time! How do people have lives? Okay, yes, farmers used to work twelve hours a day, but they were already home. They were together all the time. Have people always been so busy? " <p> The sunlight is fading, she 's breathing easier. In her lap she 's got the chimichanga in a styrofoam box, forking bits with her plastic fork and then reaching down to the floor for her beer. <p> " I was n't so busy when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought I was working my butt off but never like you guys. You get more done in less time. " <p> " I wish, " she says with a scowl. " Anyway Ethan 's not very sympathetic to my situation. We have to schedule stress-free time. " <p> " So why come up here when you and he could be having an evening? " <p> Her phone burbles, and she opens it. It 's Ethan, so naturally she 's answered. " I 'm balancing a chimichanga on my lap trying to talk to my father... I had to check in about this new lady... Matt told me, and Matt told Mommy of course. " She shoots me a guilty look. " Yeah, she 's a lesbian, Ethan. That 's why it 's good. Daddy needs friends. He 's here in this weird place all by himself. Oh, it 's nice. We 're watching the sunset... Of course he 's right here. I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " I say. Ethan is rather stiff for his age but pleasant enough. He 's more dependable than Noah. <p> " I 'll be home, I 'll be home! " Her phone clicks shut. " He 's nervous about me driving after dark. " <p> " I should never have mentioned Violet to your brother. " <p> " What, " she says, " you thought it was only man-to-man? Of course he 'd tell me and Mommy. But what did you actually tell him because Matt always elaborates. At first I thought he was making up the lesbian stuff. " <p> I take a long swallow of my own beer to ponder a while. I never think of them talking about me. " I told him that a week or two ago an attractive young woman named Violet Evelyn Smith moved in across the piazza and she works at the Nursery - you know, the garden place at the next exit - and she 's a lesbian so do n't worry your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone. Our faces are lit by the lights in Perugia 's windows. The lamp by my couch sends its yellow light out onto the fake-stucco walls of my loggia. Em is giving me her perturbed look. " I 'm going to have to inspect this Violet, " she says. " Look, Daddy, the point is I do n't want you all lonesome in your Umbrian village. Mommy has her Shelter friends. And she has all those dogs! So Violet is what you need. " <p> " Em, did you come up here to gripe about stress or did your mother send you? " <p> She looks at me severely, her slender saintly arms crossing her heart. " Daddy, I promise I will never get involved between you and Mommy ever. I have a right to check in, do n't I? So does Matt. He and I have a right to discuss our parents. So anyway this case I 'm on, it 's so dumb! An old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now he 's a vegetable. I do n't know who 's the worse sleaze, the garage door installers or his wife 's lawyers. " <p> " So you 're working for the installers? " <p> " That 's what we got, Daddy. " <p> So we discuss the details of the case, and it 's a nice visit. I 'm sad when she drives off in her new Focus. We 're no longer under the same roof. <p> In bed I relax with the clicker and the TV. I do n't stay long on any channel unless my favorite shows are on, which they are n't - Amy Sedaris, Tracy Ullman, Sarah Silverman, shows with nutty ladies. When I was a kid I watched " Our Miss Brooks, " " My Little Margie, " " I Married Joan " - I 'd like to see those old shows again to find out what used to make me laugh. <p> In the open window there 's a late summer breeze. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind in the pines. <p> Why am I telling you this? And who are you anyway? Perhaps you 're Violet. I would like to tell all these things to Violet Evelyn Smith - my life, my feelings for her, my advice to her, my wisdom if I can give myself credit for having any. What would she think of me talking to her this way? But we sort of do talk to each other like this. Or without saying it in words we say it in glances, smiles, pats of the hand, comfortable shrugs. She likes me, I can say that. It 's only for now, it 's only here, I 'm not expecting more. <p> Violet, what do you see when you look at me? I know you 're not attracted to men, especially not to men so much older. Maybe you went through a phase with high school boys your age, nice boys I hope, you would n't put up with assholes. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly that you turned to women. No, you plain like women. I entirely understand what that 's like. Maybe I can even see women through your eyes. I can see what you must 've seen in Gretchen. I picture her like my Xan only younger. Gretchen 's actually pale, blond, blue-eyed, but you did say she was small. Xan 's dark and warm and huggable because though she looks as if she might break, she wo n't. <p> So what do I look like to you, Vi? Some old guy, a nice guy, yes, comfortable, no threat, not the hefty tough father you 've told me about. Maybe I 'm the listener father you did n't have. You ca n't imagine yourself getting as old as I am, can you, but I can easily imagine myself young like you. It 's clear in my mind because I once was. You have n't been old yet. In dreams I 'm never old. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore, rough seas, cliffs, two pudgy beagles swimming out toward me. I woke up sweating from the struggle of lifting them into the boat. <p> I do n't think of Vi as my second daughter. I already have a perfect daughter. I 'm not missing anything, daughter or son. I think of Vi - no, I 'm talking to her : I think of you, Vi, as a grown woman. Did n't even thirty-six once seem old? But what 's thirty-six in the world 's time? We 're on this planet for however many more years. It 's a celestial second. <p> I must fold back this sweat-damp sheet and go shower and find a fresh short-sleeve shirt that 's not too wrinkled. Yesterday 's slacks will still do. AuthorAffiliation <p> JONATHAN STRONG has published a dozen novels.
