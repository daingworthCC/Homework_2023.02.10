1018941 For two years or so I had enjoyed thinking of myself as a great friend to Brewster until the day I understood that I was not, a day shortly before he moved out of the apartment complex we both lived in. I had managed to forget that day until yesterday morning when his daughter called - he 'd mentioned a daughter somewhere in the East - and told me Brewster had died. I held the phone in my hand and waited, blank, trying to remember what to say, who I was. <p> She was in town, from Connecticut, for a few more days. She had been with him when he died. He 'd left me some money. I was to take one of his cats, too, she said, he said you 'd know which one. Could I come over to the house? Did I know where it was? She gave me the address, and I agreed to drop by later in the day. She said, " I do n't know what to do with the other cats ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we had had a stupid quarrel over it once, but that had gotten straightened out. Still, I did n't bother going over there, the afternoon passed and I had dinner and watched something on HBO and by that time it seemed awful late. I did n't need a cat to take care of, anyway. <p> I had n't seen Brewster since he moved, about five months before. It was eerie, imagining him speaking - about me - yesterday or the day before and now not speaking anymore. He was twice my age, but a bond had been fashioned out of necessity, because he was old and alone, because my life had turned up all zeroes - all I had was a job and this apartment. It has n't gotten any better since he moved. It seems strange but the time I knew him had become in my memory an oddly contented and happy time, one of those periods of one 's life during which one bitches and complains incessantly which later becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about those months : we had shared a lot of evenings, eaten together, played card games, talked a lot, did some drinking, awaited and then watched favorite TV shows every week, rituals of a friendship. He had lent me money and then forgiven the debts ; I had helped him out sometimes. He said his son was in California, maybe Washington state. He never heard from him. I had had a father who was easy to disappoint, and after I disappointed him I took poor care of him, which maybe explains the Brewster thing. <p> For the two years we were friends I did everything that Brewster needed done, so much so that I got into the habit of knocking on his door when I got home from work in case there was some errand or muscle work he needed, so I could get it done before I settled in to watch the news and have dinner, so that I would n't be interrupted ; it was a practical matter. I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs at the apartments, past mine on the second level, up to his on the third, knock and wait until he came to the door, say Hi, as if I were checking on him. <p> Often he did n't have anything for me to do. But sometimes he 'd have some job he 'd saved all day until I got home, hold this, drill this, cut this, move these over there and those where these were, do you know where I can find a good this, maybe you could accompany me there. He had been an engineer but his father had done millwork and fine carpentry, worked a lathe, skills Brewster had learned as a boy and used to make tables and shelving, cabinets, and small cases for things, beautifully crafted boxes made from wood and covered in fabric, although now at seventy-something his hands were unsteady and his eyes were shot. <p> One month I took him to the eyeglasses place six times on lunch hours and hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of glasses through which he could see. I never knew, still do n't know, whether the glasses were good and he was just crazy or whether the optometrists and opticians were the most incompetent fools God ever made. It was funny, watching them try to deal with him, condescending but forgiving him everything because he was old, him playing that for all it was worth. We 'd laugh afterward, but each time he would say, " I really ca n't see worth a damn, " no matter how many times they remade the glasses. " They just think I 'm a crazy old duck, " he would say. <p> " An old duck " is what he called himself and any other old man he liked. A man he did n't like was a " louse. " I liked him, in part, because he talked like no one else I knew, probably only a reflection of his age, vestiges of another time showing in his vocabulary, favorite expressions, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language, though " damn " and " hell " were common coin. <p> I still live in the apartment complex. He had been here for years - I never was clear on how many - when I moved in two years ago. I do n't want to go to his place. I do n't want to see it. When he was evicted from the apartments, he asked me to move in with him, to split the house he was moving to. I had sort of agreed ; at least we had talked about getting a place at one time, so he had reason to expect it, but when it really came up, I could n't get over the idea of moving in with a seventy-year-old man. He was way past caring about how strange such a roommate arrangement might seem. I was afraid of getting still more tangled up than I already was, of his growing dependency, of making my temporary abandonment of social life with people of my own age and station into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not have meant that, but at the time the prospect felt like being pulled under water I had been just sort of pleasantly floating in, expecting sometime sooner or later to return to land. So I guess I was n't much of a friend to him, when it came down to it, or at least had misrepresented the friend I was. <p> " You know, " Brewster said, " you could move in with me. Take half the house. There 're two kitchens over there. Four bedrooms. " We were standing on the concrete walkway outside the apartment he was leaving. He was serious. " We could split it up any way you want. " His body was short and heavy with a belly and thick forearms, still strong. His big, bald, ruddy face had round areas where the skin looked thin and stretched, broken capillaries, spots, and some kind of ugly black scar or growth on one ear. He was looking at me. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing in my head was what I usually said to Brewster - " Sure " - and I did n't want to say that. Finally I said, " Well, " and looked down into the courtyard, so obviously with nothing to look at that I almost stumbled into the railing. Brewster shrugged, and the light left his blue eyes. " Well, you can think about it, " he said. " House is n't going anywhere. " He nodded to the door of his now bare apartment. " Play some cards? " We went in. <p> They had no reason to throw him out, but they said it was the cats. Brewster had nine cats, and two of them lived in the stove, an ordinary sort of eccentricity, as common as cornflakes, the kind of thing nobody gives a moment 's thought until for some other reason the light of the community shines on you and suddenly there 's a mob of good upstanding citizens all jabbering fiercely to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cats were pretty good about it ; they would do their business outside under the shrubbery or on the tiny lawn around the apartments. Every night at ten o'clock, the old man 's door would swing open ten inches or so and the cats, or most of them, would step out single file - a big old Siamese, followed by a gray, two black ones, a fluffy calico, another that looked red, others. They 'd step along the walk and down the concrete stairway like ducks, and then scatter, and if they did n't all come back smartly at ten thirty, you would hear the old man whistling for the stragglers. <p> I had met Brewster a few weeks after I had taken the apartment on the floor below him. It 's a four-story building with forty or forty-five apartments, a large parking area at one end. One sunny Saturday afternoon I was working on my car in the parking lot, a simple repair, putting new pads in the brakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Car repair was clearly not considered proper parking lot activity at this complex, which added to Brewster 's pleasure in helping out. We got along well from the first. It was n't long before we joked about getting a place together somewhere, about getting away from the old women who more or less ran our building. He was chary of the management company, too, because of the cats. <p> He was particularly sweet on the Siamese, whose name was Antibody, but he called it " A. B., " or more often, " Abe. " It was about sixteen years old, and liked its comforts. The one I liked best was what they call a " snowshoe, " a cat that looked Siamese-y but with bright white paws and nose, like the " points " were reversed. This one, the one we argued about, Brewster called " Killer-T. " It was some kind of weird joke. He spent contented hours reading medical magazines at a branch library. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wander into the kitchen and jump onto the open door of the oven and walk into it, I stopped what we were doing - we were playing gin - and pointed and stuttered, " The cat, the cat, " but he just smiled and nodded and told me they lived in there, the twin black ones. All the cats, except for the one he called Red, had names out of the P.D.R. - the Physicians ' Desk Reference, which I soon discovered was probably Brewster 's favorite book - and were christened after disease fighters, cells, and medicines : Leukocyte and Lymphocat, Amoxicillin and Streptomycin, and so on. The old man was a hypochondriac as well as a cat lover, and although it was an ironic hypochondria, he was n't joking. He did n't like doctors much, but when I took him to see them, he repeated what they said as if it were the revealed word of God. His refrigerator was crowded with carrots and brussels sprouts and broccoli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, glucosamine and other pills, as well as jars of olive oil, which looked like green lard. <p> We spent a lot of time playing games. I work for the city in the Clerk Assessor 's office, I 'm twice divorced, and my mother and sister live over a thousand miles from here in Arizona, so I guess I needed Brewster as much as he needed me. I spent a lot of evenings up there playing gin, blackjack, whist, even Hold ' em, as well as Scrabble and checkers and chess. For a month or so we played a basketball game we made up, best of ten shots, using a plastic bucket and a ball he 'd bought at the supermarket. We even went to a bar one time and shot pool for a couple of hours, but he did n't care for the atmosphere. It depressed him - " too much smoke and too many young women with too little clothes on, " he said. I think he just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Our leases prohibited pets, but lots of people kept them, and no one ever hassled any of us about it. It was benign neglect. Once a week or so, whenever I get in the service elevator to go down to the washers and dryers in the basement, there 's some ditzy guy with a couple of big fluffy spaniels or whatever they are, heading out for their walk. <p> I had taken to letting Snowshoe into my apartment, but it was when she started spending the night at my place that Brewster got upset and threatened getting me evicted. I told him that " Killer " was a stupid name for a cat that was as sweet and lamblike as it could be. He made fun of me for saying " lamblike " and said I did n't know what I was talking about. He said he was going to call the damn police on me if I ever did it again. Astonished, I told him the cat never wanted to leave, and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it did n't want to go. He said just remember what he 'd told me. I 'd be looking for a new apartment in the time it took to say " Jack Robinson. " " Jack Robinson, " I said. We were behaving like children. <p> That was in August, when everyone was in a foul mood because of the heat. We had window unit air-conditioners which were old and noisy and expensive to run, so you either stayed in the cool part of the apartment all the time or you went out. Brewster was smart ; he spent the hot afternoons at the library, where they had the AC cranked up to flurries. The cat, Snowshoe, as soon as Brewster let them out in the morning, came down to sit outside my front window. Brewster 's other cats hung around together and when any of the neighbors ' cats got aggressive, two or three of Brewster 's would start showing shoulders and snarling, and if that were n't enough they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaints, but mostly it was only noise and mostly he got them inside by ten-thirty, so it was never a big problem. <p> By late August, Brewster and I had sort of patched things up - I gave in, is how that went. I liked playing cards, especially when my only likely alternative was an evening flipping through my forty-eight channels on the remote control and then going to bed tired but not sleepy. <p> I was n't dating then, had n't been since I got my second divorce, which was n't an actual divorce because Michelle and I had just been keeping company, we were n't married. Afterward, there were n't a lot of possibilities. After a certain age and in certain jobs, you never meet anybody. There was supposed to be a new woman at the tax office in June, but she turned out to be a he - they hired a man. <p> For Brewster, the old woman he had sometimes spent time with, a sarcastic British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, had died in the spring, so he was as alone as I was. After she died, he had broken into her apartment - the lock was n't much - and taken a weird collection of stuff. He had photographs of her and him, a square jar full of sand, a slab of polished green and white malachite stone, and her hair dryer, a big old one with the bonnet in a round carrier, all on the shelves in his living room with books and magazines and a Civil War pistol that did n't shoot. <p> So I was up there playing cards one afternoon when there came this pounding on the door. The place shook. He got up and opened it and there stood Mrs. Eller, screaming, pointing down into the courtyard ; a fenced space behind the building with a small swimming pool rimmed by stones set in concrete and stocked with white iron lawn furniture. <p> We were three floors up. We stepped out onto the walkway and looked down into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got downstairs we found the woman 's orange striped cat in the pool. She said that old Abe and a couple of the others had chased it in there and drowned it, that it was terrified of the water. There was blood in the pool, too, a stain holding together, apparently from the head or ear. I got the skimmer and pushed it in under the cat and lifted him out, swung him over onto the stone. When I looked around, Brewster stood behind me with his arms dull at his sides, his rugged hands quivering at the cuffs of his gray shirt. He was looking over my shoulder at the dead cat, inconsolable. <p> I have seen grown men cry, but Brewster was past seventy, and I had never seen an old man cry. It was a terrible thing. I put my arms around him. " C'm on, " I said. " Let 's go upstairs. " I had this sick feeling in my stomach. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but I could n't do both of them. I looked around, hoping one of the other old women would show up. Mrs. Eller was dull-eyed, opaque. " Sorry, " I said. <p> It just got worse. A few days later, the Siamese, old Abe, disappeared, so I took off work and we spent all day and most of the night out looking. I was afraid of finding Abe dead on the road that ran in front of the apartments, though the cats did n't go out there much. A couple of days passed. Brewster was certain that Mrs. Eller had done it. He claimed that he had heard Abe calling - every Siamese has a distinctive voice, he said - from somewhere on the first floor. I laughed, and he looked at me. " It just seems. unlikely, " I said. A week after that, Brewster got a letter from the management company 's lawyers which informed him that as he had violated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and as those animals had become a nuisance to the other tenants, etc., etc., etc. They gave him two weeks. <p> Someone told him about an old house, across town, near a park, and I helped him pack, boxing and taping. He never would have gotten it done, did n't seem to care. There was n't much to it. He lived a pretty spartan existence except for the cats and his wood work, and what seemed to be every issue of Prevention magazine ever published. He had three drawers full of medicines, salves and pills and drops, not for him but for the cats. Brown prescription bottles with " Antibody Brewster " and " Abe " and " Moxy " and sometimes " cat " for the patient 's name. He had a lot of clothes he never wore, books, some odds and ends. The apartment did smell, and packing it up seemed to make it worse. As we threw windows open to air it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you care. " " They 'll think they were right, " he said. " They 'll congratulate themselves. " <p> All through the last few days of the packing I wanted to say something - some new and better way of phrasing " no " - but after that one time he never asked me again about moving in with him. <p> The day before he left he was still swearing that Mrs. Eller had stolen his cat. We had everything ready to go, in cartons by the door, and the manager had arranged a truck for his furniture. We played a half dozen games of whist, dealing cards out on top of the cardboard boxes, and then I got up to go home. <p> I looked around the bare living area. The remaining cats were all there in the front room, and it occurred to me that they were there because they were afraid of being left behind. " Hey, Brewster, " I said, " I 'm thinking about just staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, tried to get myself to look at him. " I 'll think about it, but I 'll probably just stay. " <p> " Yeah, I figured, " he said. He was standing up, waiting. It felt like he was pushing me out the door. " Listen, I want you to keep Killer. You know, the little one. " <p> " I could n't take her, " I said. <p> " Oh sure you could. " <p> " I 'll see her over at your place, " I said, and then a strange look flashed across his face for a second, and he abandoned the idea. <p> The next morning while the women were all gathered around the pool and the two guys the manager had hired were filling up a van with Brewster 's furniture and boxes, he showed up at my door with a fat plastic garbage bag and this giant smile on his flawed, reddish old face. He laughed. " Here, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I found. And exactly where I said he 'd be. " I took the bag from him. It twitched ; it was heavy. It was Abe, of course. Brewster had rescued him. That was the last time we saw each other. But the daughter called again this morning. So here I am, like a fool. The house is canary yellow with a half-circle driveway in front under high pine trees. I park my car behind a rental Buick near the door and get out. I have bought and brought a plastic " cat carrier " but leave it on the passenger seat. When I push the doorbell, a short woman about forty years old in a black dress comes and opens the door. Her name is Susan. There 'll be no funeral for Brewster ; he 's to be cremated. Only six cats are left - " The other one died a month ago, " Susan says - and I wonder what she would 've thought had she seen nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handsome new gray tabby, a fluffy Angora-looking one, and the twins. So much for superstitions. " There 'll be almost twenty thousand dollars for you. Daddy was always pretty frugal, except for them, " she says, looking affectionately at the cats, curled up together on a futon couch I do n't recognize. " I 'll hate to have to take them to the pound, but. " She shrugs. <p> The house looks inside much like Brewster 's apartment always looked - comfortable, squared away - although that may be Susan 's doing. There 's a long counter, a serving bar between the kitchen and dining room, and arrayed on top are five or six of the fabric-covered boxes that Brewster made, along with a camera and his antique pistol. " Do you want that? " Susan asks when she notices me notice it. " Take anything you want, really. " " No, but thanks, " I say. <p> There 're lots of windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house. Open cartons on the floor show books, and the kitchen 's completely done, with cabinet doors swung open, empty shelves, dishes and glasses and such swathed in newspapers in more cardboard cartons, waiting only to be sealed. Three big dark green " lawn and leaf " plastic bags are lined up beside the front door. Odd that I did n't see them before. His clothes, probably. They 're the same sort of bag he had Abe inside five months ago. It occurs to me only now that the cat could 've suffocated, for some reason a suddenly terrifying thought. <p> I look around, searching for Abe, to make sure I did see him, just now, and there he is, asleep, indifferent. I wonder if he is sad, if he knows that Brewster is n't ever coming back. <p> " So, which one is it? " Susan asks and slides to the couch where the cats are, settles at one end and reaches out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those boxes, " I say, and when she gives me a puzzled look, " one of the cases he built, the camera case, or the one he made for the cassettes and CDS. They 're beautiful things. " <p> " Surely, " she says, " anything you want. I 'm shipping a few things north, but most of it is going to go to the trash or the Salvation Army, so do n't be shy. It feels like throwing away his whole life. " <p> I pick a box, a rectangular one the size of an encyclopedia, covered in gray material, and open it. The inside, finished in gray felt, is four long horizontal compartments, the last one divided into thirds. A fancy paper clip and two of those sleek blue pencils with black tips lie in one of the compartments. Staedtler. It 's a beautiful thing. What was this for? The box closes perfectly, and then holds closed with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes into my mind : Brewster 's been completely alone for five months. <p> " Now I wish I had come down here more than a couple times, " she says. " I feel so selfish. " She looks teary, then slips into her thoughts, a vacant look, and shakes her head slowly side to side. <p> " Susan, I do n't mean to be weird, but I do n't want the money, " I say. " Do something with it for me, will you? " <p> " Do n't think I can do that, " she says. " Legally, I mean. " <p> " I 'll write a letter. Give it to the Humane Society or something. I 'm serious. I absolutely ca n't take it. " I hold my hands up, palms out. " It 's wrong, " I say, as if that made any sense, and walk up to the couch. The snowshoe cat seems to recognize me, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand. <p> " This 'd be the one, " I say. " He called it ' Killer. ' " Involuntarily I laugh and Susan looks at me and laughs, too. I raise my free hand to my face and try to force a straight expression, but laugh again. <p> " Well, I 'm sure you 'll take good care of her, " she says. " There 's some more stuff in that front bedroom, " she points. " If you want to look at it. I 'd rather you had it than nobody. " She stands up and smoothes her skirt, lifts her purse from a table, back to being businesslike. She 's leaving. " I 've got to go back by the funeral home that 's handling things, and the supermarket. More tape, more boxes. I 'm sorry, I do n't mean to be rude. But you 'll be all right. And seriously, it would n't bother me if the whole place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door to when you leave. There 're two big bags of that special veterinary catfood in the laundry room. It 'll just go to waste otherwise. " She points past the kitchen. " It was nice to meet you. Daddy really loved you, I think. " She walks on out, shuts the door behind her, and there 's the sound of a car door and the engine firing, then complete silence. <p> It feels weird being there by myself so I collect the gray box in one hand and Killer in the other hand and walk out and put them in my car, then come back inside for the bags of catfood. The other cats follow to the door, standing by as I carry away the two heavy bags. I put the bags in the trunk, then get in the car and sit for a while looking at his house. It 's quiet. I ca n't leave, it 's as if something 's holding me there, I 'm starting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't left first. I wish she 'd come back. I wish, I wish, I wish. <p> The cats go limp, legs hanging free, when I carry them out to the car, one after another, one in each hand, as if they 've known all along that they 're leaving with me and have been waiting only for the idea to show up in my mind. The car 's full of their faces. <p> Shrug it off. They 're just cats, stepping around on the upholstery, sniffing at things, sidling between the seats, settling, jumping, finding spots, all eyes. I feel better now, though, and glance back up at the house, at the yellow door. " Okay? " I ask, loud. Alone. Turn the key the engine starts the car rocks a little, ease into gear down the drive and into the street. I have been talking to someone pretty much my whole life long. <p> <p> By Steven @ @
