" No one laughs. Their blank stares commu nicate only this : It 's the first day of class. Do n't get cute. Hand out the syllabus and we 'll see you on Tuesday. I ask them to find a partner, thinking I 'll have them introduce one another to the group, but cave when I see their eyes roll, hear the groans from the back of the room. " Actually, let 's start from here next time, " I say, and pass out the syllabus. A modicum of relief enters the classroom as they pack their bags and leave, suctioned from their desks to the door as if by pneumatic tubing. Afterward, I head to the office I share with an emeritus professor who rarely comes around. I check e-mail and find my wife has written. We used to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive w ith all the formality of a communique. Paul, I would like to get some more of my things this evening. Please leave the house from 7-8. -- Linda. Strange to think of her across campus, over in Sociology, composing this terse missive. Stranger still to think that when the divorce papers arrive, we could, if so inclined, settle the whole matter via intracampus mail. I 'm debating w hether to reply w hen Brad, the chair of the history departm ent, pops in to say hello. " Welcome back, partner. How was break? " " Cold, " I say. He laughs and asks if my eleven thirty went okay. Brad toes a fine line between adm inistra tor and concerned colleague, a fact that seems to color any conversation I have w ith him. I should n't complain ; he 's always been pretty good to me. W hen the university hired Linda almost twenty-five years ago, he took me on as an instructor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the post-Civil War period in the South, but those first several years I taught whatever they could scrounge up for me : general history surveys, even the occasional comp class. Brad had pushed me to teach a class on Kansas histo ry, wanting me to be the departm ent 's " Kansas guy. " And so I put aside my dissertation, telling Linda it was temporary, and educated myself as quickly as I could about a state I 'd never given much thought. I understood, of course, that he hired me because the university wanted Linda, and, further, that w ithout the dissertation I would never earn tenure. Even so, I 've never forgotten his kindness. " Are you going to watch the inauguration? " he asks now. " Ever think you 'd actually see this back in the sixties? " " I teach Tuesday, " I say, and turn back to my computer screen. I can feel him lingering there, the heavy breathing of a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to work, " he says. " Say hello to Linda for me. " That night I walk downtown along Mas sachusetts Street while Linda loots our home. Lawrence is freezing, and everyone is inside watching the basketball game. I like having the streets to myself. Most of the stores have closed, but occasionally I stop to look in a window before I head to Louise 's for a schoo ner of Boulevard Wheat. Surrounded by folks fixated on the game, I wonder how many still remember that our innocuously smiling mas cot, an imaginary blue bird, got its name from the m ilitant free-staters, the Jayhawkers, who fought bloodily to bring Kansas into the Union. During a time-out, the mascot runs around the court, entreating the crowd to clap to the beat of the band 's brassy pomp. I watch the game clock, imagining Linda moving quietly through our house alone, taking things. When the game ends, I pay my tab and walk home in the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gone. She left the day after New Year 's, informing me when she came downstairs with matching blue luggage as I dozed through the final minutes of a bowlgame blowout. She said if she did n't do it that second, she 'd lose her nerve, and before I could even rise she was turning the doorknob. She says it 's too difficult to see me, that we need some time apart to get used to the separation. So far I have respected her wishes, resisting the fleeting tem ptation to stop by her office unan nounced, or, in my lowest moments, to sneak over and watch her teach from the hallway. I have n't made much of a fuss because I realized soon after she walked out the door that it was the right thing. Despite this, the last time I called her I made a halfhearted attem pt to rec oncile. W hen she refused, I pressed her. " I 'm not going to lie in bed next to someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " The amaz ing thing is that you could. You could do that, Paul, and you 'd never say a word. " I was hurt and started to yell, but Linda cut me off -- " This is why I do n't want to talk " -- and hung up. And though I know she 's right -- we have n't been in love for a long tim e -- it 's hard to watch her undo a life together we spent nearly forty years creating. It 's awful, these nights she asks me to leave the house. Her incremental disappear ance from my world. Each time I return home and walk slowly from room to room, opening drawers and closets, trying to find what she 's taken, trying to sense what she 's touched. tory. We talk about Andrew Jackson and Indian Removal. We talk about the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, which left the question of whether Kansas would be a free state or slave state to be decided by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ igrant Aid Society shipping abolitionist and profit-seeking east erners to Kansas -- how they settled in and es tablished this town, named after their founder Amos Lawrence. We cover Kansas becoming the thirty-fourth star on the flag and all the opposing constitutions and capitals. We talk Border War and Bleeding Kansas. John Brown and Jim Lane, Quantrill and George Todd. Do they know Q uantrill led a raid on Lawrence in 1863, that he and his men rode right down M assachusetts Street and m urdered 150 u n armed m en and boys? Some do. We unpack terms like Jayhawker and Border Ruffian. We learn about Clarina Nichols and the failed at tem pts to gain voting rights for wom en and blacks. We talk broken treaties, Indian resettle ment, and the Dog Soldiers who fought back against white aggression. to come together. They yawn and rub their eyes, nurse their hangovers. They text-message and I pretend not to notice, but it eats at me. It 's tough to fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing you 've come to depend upon. I want them to be as fascinated by the history as I was all those years ago in the library when I should have been doing research for my dissertation on the limits of Radical Recon struction of the South, but was unable to pull my nose out of a volume on Kansas. But they seem largely uninterested. Finally, I ask, " Why did you take this class? " My tone carries my frustration and they look alarmed, sitting up a little. There are mutterings of " For my major. " No one says it, but I 'm afraid a reputation as an easy grader has preceded me. Then a girl in row two says, " Because I 'm from here. " Truth be told, my memory is poor and I still have n't learned names, but she has stood out as one of the few willing contributors and attentive listeners. " That 's a good reason to care, " I say. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand where we come from, the legacies we inherit. " The thing they need to understand, I tell them, is that the history of a state, like anything, is a history of change. What makes Kansas interesting is that here these changes tend toward social and political extremes. I soapbox like this for another minute, ending emphatically with : " Kansas is and always was a radical state! " I 'm staring hard, half expecting the class to rise slowly from their chairs one by one and slow-clap my Stand and Deliver mo ment. But of course they just sit there. There is some nodding of heads, a few grins and smiles at the old prof getting animated. I tell them they can leave early. A few days later, the girl in row two ap proaches me after class. Lauren -- I 've learned her name. She is petite, w ith a short black bob that accentuates the pallor of her skin. She 's holding a book against her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it around. The book 's cover announces it as an expose of the most " dangerous " professors in the country, academics who indoctrinate stu dents w ith anti-American values. She opens to a spot she has bookmarked near the back. Side-by-side pictures : one, a mug shot from 1968, and the other, a recent photo from the departm ent website. U nderneath is a list of " crimes and exploits. " I look away from the book and m eet her stare, but she says nothing. There is a long mom ent of silence that seems to confuse the nature of this encounter. " Do you want me to sign it? " I say. " It 's why I took your class, " she says. " There are a few things you should know about that book. " " I think what you all did was brave. " " I was n't that much a part of it. " " Sure seems like it, " she says, looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how best to respond and can only offer : " That was a long time ago. " I excuse myself to head to a meeting but turn back to her. " I would appreciate if you did n't go around showing that to everyone. " The book is n't a surprise. Brad approached me about it early in the fall semester. He 's fa miliar with my past and it ' s never been an issue. This was a matter of PR. " We 've had some calls, " he said, scratching at his bald head. " From par ents and groups. With all the Ayers stuff in the campaign... they 're concerned about students taking your class. " " You make it sound like I 'm a pedophile. " " You know I think you 're a great teacher, Paul, " he said, placing a hand on my shoulder. " We would n't have renewed your appointment all these years if you were n't. " He took his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mained. Brad is big in ways I am not : He 's tall and thick, and I 'm short and lean. I ran my hands through my thinning hair, sighing, and said from rote : " Like thousands of others who are today valued and contributing members of society, I protested the war and went to jail for it. " As I finished saying this, however, I opened the book and read my entry for the first time. " Half of this is bullshit, " I said suddenly. " I was n't involved in any of the bombings. " Brad removed a pair of glasses from the breast pocket of his oxford, rereading the pas sage. " Technically he does n't say you perpe trated any of them. " " He sure as hell implies it! Christ, I mean, I was n't even underground. Linda and I left be fore everyone disappeared. " " You 've been very honest with me about your involvement, " he said, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the air between us was the obvious : Truth, and its airy abstractions, carried less weight than the physical existence of the book. We thought it would die down, but in the final month of the campaign things got worse. The calls and letters continued, people demanding the uni versity fire a " domestic terrorist. " I was really worried for a while. Without tenure, I knew, I was vulnerable. They could have easily let me go, but Brad went to bat for me, attesting to my years of excellent teaching. He dropped my spring-semester teaching load from my usual three classes to one. " Just till all the election fuss blows over. By next fall it wo n't be an is sue. " For a time I considered legal recourse of some sort, but when I talked it over with Lin da she said it would n't do any good. " This has nothing to do with you. This is about people who believe we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were drinking pinot as we stood at the island in our recently remodeled kitchen. After a moment of silence, Industrial Revolution. We talk about railroads and unregulated monopolies. We talk about exodusters and Pap Singleton 's black colonies in Hodgeman County. We look at then-andnow photographs of Nicodemus, the oldest still-surviving all-black town west of the Mis sissippi. We discuss the People 's Party and the achievements of the Populists. We cover the Legislative War and the first female elected to political office in the country, Susanna Salter, mayor of Argonia. We look at the devastation of tribes confined to reservations. We talk pro hibition and Carrie Nation raiding bars, smash ing whiskey bottles. We talk Progressive Era. We decode the political and social commentary in the strange concrete sculptures of S. P. Dinsmoor 's Garden of Eden. Do they know that Appeal to Reason, the largest circulated social ist newspaper in the country, was published in Girard, Kansas? They do not. We discuss the granting of suffrage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. We talk strikes and oil fields, the IWW and WWI. is shoving notebooks into their backpacks, Lauren stands and announces that there will be a war protest the following Tuesday near the union. " You all should come, " she says to her classmates. " It 's important we make our voices heard. " Everyone looks at me. The class has started to turn a corner since my outburst. They engage easier, the discussion is more lively. I repeat the homework assignment and tell them to have a good day. After the others leave, Lauren asks, " What 'd you do that for? " I ask her to come to my office. We walk down the hallway quietly, but when I shut the door it comes out unbidden. I tell her about drop ping out and moving from Boulder, Colorado, to Chicago to join the collective. I tell her about the Days of Rage and trying to organize revo lutionary working-class youth. I tell her about false IDs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting beaten by police and jailed. " What 's the point? " she asks. " I 'm trying to explain why I could n't just say ' extra credit for anyone who goes to the pro test. ' " " Does n't mean you have to pretend you 're someone you 're not, " she says. I try to explain about being a spousal hire and the uneasy state of my employment after the attention from the book. " It 's why they gave me only one class this semester. " To ev erything she asks why, and I try to rationalize and explain until all I can see in her expres sion is disappointment, the slight accusation of cowardice. Next class I arrive to find a flyer for the pro test taped to the dry-erase board of my room. Lauren does n't show. I leave the handbill where it is, writing dates and names from the Kansas past around it. Finally, someone asks what it is. I take it down and read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my desk and continue lecturing until our time is finished. Afterward I walk to the union, where the rally is under way. There 's a young black man standing on a stone bench. He 's wearing a heavy pea coat and a black knit hat that keeps inch ing higher off his forehead because he 's shaking from cold or anger. Suddenly he shouts : " We are at war, and we are the citizens of an empire. The crimes of our government are being com mitted in our names and we ai n't gon na stand for it any longer! " He goes on another minute and the crowd echoes back, chanting, " Not in our names. " Then I see Lauren. Booming forth from the crowd, she joins the guy on the bench. She looks around, taking in the sizeable gather ing. She opens her mouth but hesitates. I think maybe the moment has gotten to her, but she steadies herself and begins reading the casu alty figures -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries to keep secret. The crowd shouts its frozen approval, several fists raised. She is electric in her nervousness, gaining confidence with each response from the crowd. She tells us that on the count of three we will fall to the ground and lie silent for five minutes in recognition of the war dead. I 'm standing on the periphery with the other interlopers taking in the spectacle, but when she begins to count I move closer and lower myself to the snow-covered brick. Lying silently with the others, I look at the gray, sunless sky, and wonder what Linda 's doing. We never went in for something as static as a die-in. We were always marching somewhere or trying to oc cupy some building. Looking for confronta tion. I think of the march on the Pentagon and trying to break the line of police and National Guardsmen. I see Linda spitting in a marshal 's face and feel the old wounds from the clubs in my back when they countered. We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were, cuffed and put on buses that took us to separate detention facilities, I thought of her then, too, as I stretched out on the holding-cell floor. I wanted only to pay my fine so that I could re turn to her. I feel no such desire now, just the curiosity of what it would take for her to dirty her winter coat here in the snow. When the five minutes are over, we all rise and dust off our jackets. I hang around, watch ing Lauren talk to a group of people who have surrounded her. I look away when she glances in my direction, but turn back to find her smiling. " You came, " she says as she approaches. " Of course. " The other speaker walks over and joins us. He 's thinner than, and not as tall as, he looked standing on top of the bench. She introduces him, Kwame, and we shake hands. " Lauren 's told me about you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hear. " The shortest m onth of the year, February wo n't end just to spite us. We 're all runny noses and shivering, Lauren 's fair skin almost trans lucent in the cold. " What 'd you think? " Kwame asks, blowing into his hand. I tell them they 're doing the right thing, that the pressure will build. He nods as he looks around. " W hat should we do now? " he asks. I start talking about how it 's not just one rally, the commitment has to be sustained, that power concedes nothing without demand, and suddenly I 'm twenty years old and standing on a Chicago street corner haranguing some poor guy on his way to work to stop slaving for the Man and come to a fucking meeting. " Nah, I know all that, man, " says Kwame. " I just meant what should we do now? You wan na grab a drink or something? " And so I follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and w ere the only people there, which I like. The bartender wears thick black glasses and a pearl-snap cowboy shirt over a white thermal. He 's just opened. While we lean on the bar, he kneels with his back to us, slowly flipping through a crate of records on the floor behind the extra liquor bottles. He picks one and sets the needle before finally turning to serve us. There 's the old familiar crackle of stylus threading groove and then Bob Dylan 's strange country croon fills the bar as Nashville Skyline begins. We take our pints to a corner booth by the window and discuss school. They are studying poli-sci and think ing about grad programs. They do n't say so, but I can tell Lauren and Kwame are together. The occasional touch on the other 's arm as they work to articulate a point, the hopeful ex pectancy that undercuts the seriousness with which they look at each other. " So Lauren says you were in it deep back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " " Come on, man, " he says, scanning over the empty bar. " What was it like? " " What, the movement? " " Being underground. " I think a long m om ent before responding and when I do I meet their eyes and say, " How do you think? " When I say nothing else, it seems he might let it lie, but Kwame probes further : " W hat made you do it? How did you know you needed to go under? " I tell him I knew the exact moment. " I was in Chicago, walking past Fred Hamp ton 's casket after the police assassinated him and Mark Clark. " " You knew them? " Kwame asks. " The Panthers ' offices were close to ours. They used to come over, sometimes to plan joint actions, and other times, just to fuck with us, they 'd take stuff to test how truly antiracist we were. " " Am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panthers or offended you calling brothers thieves? " " I 'm just answering your question, Kwame. " The look in his eyes betrays the edge in his voice. " Go on then, " he says. So I share some of the old stories, confiding how one of the last times I heard Fred speak he seemed to augur his own death : I might begone tomorrow. I might be in jail. But when I leave, remember the last words on my lips : I am a revolutionary. " They killed him in December ' 69, " I say. " By January we were moving underground. " The ease with which I relate this story is fa miliar. The Hampton-Clark murders had a big impact on Linda and me. Over the years they became part of our personal mythology, a way in which to understand our past and to account for what had become of us since. However, usually w hen I tell it -- now and again it will come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a cautionary tale meant to explain not why we went underground but why we left the movement altogether. " Who 's ' we '? " Lauren asks. " My wife. We were there together. " There 's a pause as they nod and then I ask : " How 'd you two meet? " The look they exchange tells me my hunch was correct. I learn they had a publicpolicy class last fall. She says : " Even today people sometimes look confused when they see us walking together. " " It 's all good though, " Kwame says, a cold smile on his face. " A black m an 's in the W hite House. It 's like they say : w e 're ' postracial ' now, right? " from Linda asking if I 'll leave the house so she can gather more of her things. W ith the first hints of spring in the air, I decide to walk downtown. As I pass an Italian restaurant we used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch sight of her out of the corner of my eye, having dinner with a man. I have n't seen her since she left the house after New Year 's and can only stare. She 's straightened the curl of her long black hair, and she 's wearing an outfit I ca n't recall. I do n't recognize the guy. They 're eating and smiling, and then she turns away from him and looks out the window near where I 'm standing. Instinctively, I raise my hand, meaning, Why are n't you at the house like you saidyou ' d be? and Who ' s this asshole you 're having dinner with? But she does n't acknowledge me. She turns her attention back to the man and raises her fork to her mouth. I leave, heading home, thinking maybe she did n't see me after all. Must have been one of those tricks of the light where, inside the illuminated restaurant, she could n't see anything outside in the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velopment of the urban centers of the state. We discuss John Brinkley, the Goat Gland Doctor, who injected goat glands into men to improve virility. We marvel at how he manipulated early radio to nearly steal the 1930 gubernatorial race. We talk Depression and Dust Bowl. We read ex cerpts from the WPA Guide to 1930s Kansas and look at murals. We cover the war years, how Wichita doubled in population overnight after receiving bomber contracts from the govern ment, how German POWs were relocated to Kansas to relieve the shortage of agricultural workers. We talk NAACP and Brown v. Board of Education. Do they know that the sit-ins at Dockum 's Drugstore in Wichita preceded the fa mous Greensboro sit-ins by two years? They do not. The sixties get their own unit, culminating here in Lawrence with the 1970 riots after po lice shot two students, one black and one white. for a rally on the Mall to bring the troops home. " Me and Kwame chartered a bus and we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " she says. " You have any plans? " " In this economy? " I say. " Thought I might stay home and listen to some fireside chats on the gramophone. " It feels nice to have developed a rapport with her, one of the small pleasures of teaching. " You should come with us, " she says, setting a hand on my arm, w hich is w hat I 'm look ing at when I hear Brad 's loud voice from the hallway, asking if I have a second. " Sorry to interrupt, " he says. " Did n't realize you were holding office hours. " " It 's okay. " I wave him in. " Lauren was just leaving. " She shoulders her bag and heads for the door. I wish her good luck in Washington. " What 's in Washington? " asks Brad affably. " Family? " " A protest against the wars, " she answers. " Ah, " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. After Lauren leaves, Brad closes the door and pulls a chair close like he 's going to give me a real talking-to. He leans forward. " I heard about you and Linda. " " Oh yeah, " I say. " What 'd you hear? " " I bumped into her earlier today. She said you two were separated. " " Yeah. " We let that silence just hang there awkward ly for a few seconds. " I 'm sorry, " he says, putting a big paw on my shoulder. " I was n't aware. Are you doing okay? " I tell him I 'm fine, that we 'd been growing apart for years. " Really, " I say, " it 's the best thing for both of us. " He takes this in with a series of hurried nods. He seems to w ant to say more, but I tell him I need to go. " I 've been through it myself, " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to talk. " to myself again. Between teaching and our life together, my attention was always directed by the concerns of one or the other. Since January it seems all I 've had is time, and without mar riage, teaching has rushed in to fill the void. And so over spring break I 'm not on vacation or visiting family. I stay home and tinker with my syllabus and course schedule, reading a new book I want to incorporate into class next fall. The Friday before returning to school I get an e-mail from Lauren. For a brief second I misread the name, mistaking it for another please-leave-the-house note from Linda, and feel relieved w hen I realize the error. Lau ren 's message is brief. She says the DC trip fell through and asks if we can meet. I type Come by my office Monday. My cursor hovers over S e n d, then I delete and type Walk tomorrow? giving her my home address and the time. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, forty-five minutes late. She 's wearing jeans and a red sweatshirt too big for her. Kwame 's, I imagine. " Sorry, I lost track of time. " I pull on my jacket and step onto the porch. A cold front has come through and a heavy gust of wind kicks up over the railing. She lowers the hood of the sweatshirt and says she needs to make a phone call before we head out. " Forgot my cell, " she says. " Would you mind if I used your landline? It wo n't take a second. " " Of course, " I say, pointing toward the kitch en. She takes the handset from the cradle on the wall, looking at me over her shoulder before dialing. I walk upstairs to my study to give her some privacy. A m inute later she calls out my name and I tell her to come here. I 've taken off my jacket and slung it over the back of my chair. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desks at opposite walls, surrounded by book shelves. But for a few stray paperclips, hers is cleared out and the bookshelves stand half full. The wooden stairs creak from Lauren ' s languid ascension. When she appears in the doorway, she 's looking all around herself like a thief cas ing the joint. " Last throes of winter out there, " I say. " I thought we could talk here. " She agrees. " So tell me what happened with Washington. " She explains that the donors who fronted most of the money pulled out two days before, an unforeseen result of the ongoing financial collapse. She 's looking across the hallway where I 've left the bedroom door open. I imagine what she 's seeing. The built-in bookshelves we put in ten years ago that span an entire wall. The green leather ergonomic reading chair by the window imported from Sweden. The attached bath we added w ith a whirlpool and a dual head standing shower. " Look at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This could be my parents ' home. " I feel a rush of embarrassment followed by anger and disgust. She 's right. I 'd often found myself wondering what the hell had become of us over the years. When we were young we 'd be lieved in Karl Marx and permanent revolution but in middle age had come to find our faith in Martha Stewart and the permanent renova tion of our home. It was n't always this way. For a number of years after leaving the movement we were still active politically, but slowly, after returning to school, the concerns of the profes sional began to eclipse the political. We used to spend entire days knocking on doors and now we write checks to progressive organizations and donate to Democracy Now before dashing off to the university for a meeting. " It was my wife, " I say. " She wanted all of this. " " Your wife, " Lauren says. She takes a step across the hallway to look farther into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a natural-history museum. She leans against the doorframe, and I rise from my chair and move to stand behind her. " Where is she? " she asks. " Ex-wife, " I cor rect. I touch her shoulder and my hand moves to her nape and down her spine, but her sweat shirt is so baggy, I wonder if she feels anything. " She did this to you? " I say nothing. I follow her eye-line to the California king, where pillows we bought from a hotel while on vacation after claiming the best night of sleep of our lives are stacked neatly at the head of the bed. " Why 'd you let her? " I take her hand. " You did n't have a say? " Then I lead her inside. Afterward, we lie silent. I think maybe she 's fallen asleep, but then she rolls away from me and asks, " Do you sleep with many of your students? " " This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel defensive, then strangely flattered by the awful cliche. " And you and Kwame? " " We have an open relationship. " She pulls on the red sweatshirt, zipping it up over her bare breasts, and drinks from a cup of water I set on the nightstand the previous evening. I tell her how when Linda and I lived in the collective everyone slept with one another and how much I hated it. She asks if that 's where we met. I shake my head. " In school. SDS. We ' d been active for a few years but dropped out when it felt like protesting was n't enough. " She stands and the sweatshirt falls past her underwear, hanging mid-thigh. " How 'd you learn to make bombs? " She looks out the window, glass at her chest. " Do n't get any ideas, " I say. " Oh, please. " She turns, a cruel smile on her face. " Do you know how easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious how a bunch of college dropouts became underground bomb-makers before the internet. " " We were n't underground, " I say. She has a bemused look on her face. " The book got a few things wrong. " I 'm explaining, watching the pale of her skin start to rouge, when she cuts me off. " Were you planning on telling me this after you fucked me, or had it crossed your mind when you were holding court at the bar, talking Fred Hampton and bombs? " " I did know him, " I say. " And I never said anything about bombs. " " You said you 'd been underground! " H er body 's tensed, ready to pounce on any answer I might give, when I hear a funny sound I ca n't quite place. She stoops to the floor, pulls her jeans from under the bed, and removes something from the back pocket. Her cell phone. " Thought you forgot it at home, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking her head. Quickly she pulls on her jeans -- " You 're a liar and a bad fuck " -- and leaves. calls me at home in mid-April, I 'm sure she 's gone to the adm inistration, but he only asks how I 'm doing with the separation. Often this is his way of priming you for taking on some extra duty -- advising an additional thesis, let ting a prospective student observe class, filling in for someone on sick leave -- and I wish he would cut to the chase. " We 're getting divorced, " I say. " So you 're not going to try and work it out, " he says. " It 's mutual, then? " " This was my decision, " I say, feeling resent ful of his prying. His response, a plaintive hmm hanging in the phone 's static ether, makes me furious. This could go on all night. I tell him I have papers to grade. " Hang on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just flipping through my calendar here and thought we could pick a time for a year-end lunch. " Almost a decade ago Brad began the tradition of taking each member of the depart m ent out to lunch after finals, a nice gesture that allowed him to " check in, " as he likes to say. We set up a time after my last class and I 'm thankful to finally get off the phone. learn their names, and then I have them, and then our time together is over. I feel good that we rebounded from a rocky start. I take pride in what I feel is their genuine interest in the complexity of the state. In the final weeks we 're almost at the present. We 've covered the rise of cultural conservatism, the growing activism of the Right over the last few decades. We 've talked about the Summer of Mercy in 1991, w hen m en and w om en chained themselves to fences outside clinics in W ichita and laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot. We do n't know it yet, but in a m atter of weeks a member of an increasingly m ilitant antiabortion m ovem ent will m ur der abortion doctor George Tiller in his own church. We 've discussed the state Board of Ed considering banning Charles Darwin from sci ence curriculums. Do they know that it was n't until 1986 that liquor by the drink was legalized as well as other " sin amendments " like the lot tery and wagering? They do not. We 've looked at clips on YouTube of Fred Phelps and his fol lowers protesting at the funerals of the Iraq War dead, shouting at aggrieved families that their sons and daughters died because God is punishing us for homosexuality. We 're reading What ' s the Matter with Kansas? I collect their final papers. Lauren 's chair, a long time empty, has become the spot where a neighboring student places his backpack. I 've checked with her other teachers and they report she has n't been in class for weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I find out where she is. She ' s taking a break from school, he writes. Went to San Francisco to work for a single payer group on healthcare reform. I write back asking for more details, but he does n't respond. When I meet Brad, he 's already sitting at the table of the restaurant he suggested, the Ital ian place downtown where I saw Linda having dinner. " Fancy, " I say, taking a seat across from him. Usually we just grab a burger at the union. " It 's the end of the semester, " he says. " We should celebrate. " It 's late afternoon and the restaurant is nearly empty in these dead hours between lunch and dinner. We reflect on the semester 's classes, float plans for the summer. He tells me about his divorce and I listen politely, oc casionally commiserating, though I realize my regret at having stayed in the relationship too long is no m atch for his pain at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been cleared and w ere finishing our glasses of wine when he says, " There 's something I need to tell you. Something difficult. " " It 's only been an hour, " I say. " Why cut to the chase now? " He smiles, but it turns into a grimace. " This is n't easy for me. " He looks down at the white tablecloth. " The adm inistration has decided not to renew your teaching appointment. " " W hat? " " I 'm so sorry, Paul. " " You 're serious? Why? " " They -- " " Did Lauren come to you? " " Who 's Lauren? " I look around the restaurant. People, like us, doing what they do in restaurants. " Because I left Linda? " " No, of course not. " " I 'm a good teacher, Brad. You 've read my evals. " " I know you are. That 's why I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " " I 'm sixty-one and never finished my Ph.D., " I say. " No one is going to hire me. " He tells me he can make some calls, that he has friends at many colleges. I 've had only one glass of wine, but I feel flushed, florid, as though I 've had several carafes. Then I put it to gether. Of course : " This is because of the book. " A look of confusion comes across his face. " You 're scared of having me on staff. " " The book? " he says. " No, we 're past that. " " Bullshit. " " The book 's history, Paul. " " You 're caving to their pressure because I was a revolutionary. " " Revolutionary? I defended you, remember, " he says, exasperated. He puts his elbows on the table. " Look, I know this is a shock, but this is n't about the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university is hemorrhaging mon ey -- they 're trying to figure out how to keep the people they have to pay. " He says things like " tuition spike, " " massive cuts, " " furlough days, " but I barely take it in, dazed. " W hat about my classes? " I finally say. " Who 's going to teach them? " " Someone with tenure, most likely. " " Who? " I ask. " You? " " Maybe, " he says. " I do n't know. " He leans back in his chair. " Honestly, I 'm not sure wheth er the Kansas class will survive. They w ant a more global, international focus. They 're talk ing about restructuring the major, combining departm ents even. It 's a real shit storm. " He shrugs. " We have no idea what 's going to hap pen. " I 'm trying to imagine which is worse, the thought of Brad teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a final time while she gets the last of her stuff. I e-mail back saying I will, but I do n't. I wait in the study, updating my CV for the first time in years. When I hear the keys in the lock and the groan of the front door, I do n't say anything. I listen to the pop of her heels on the wood floor, the rustle of her turning over mail that still comes in her name that I collect in a pile on the kitchen table. Then she 's coming upstairs. She goes to the bedroom and I hear her rummage through the closet, the sound of hangers sliding over the metal rod. As she leaves the bedroom, she glances toward the study -- " Jesus, you scared me! " -- and drops an armful of clothes to the floor. " What the hell are you doing here, Paul? " " I wanted to see you. " She looks down at the pile of brightly col ored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ing jeans and a T-shirt, the way she used to on the weekends w hen we 'd run our errands or spend a few hours knocking around the yard. " You 're not supposed to be here. You said you would n't. " I tell her I did n't mean to scare her, that I was just enjoying the sounds of her be ing in the house again. The curl in her hair has returned and she 's pulled it back in a ponytail. Though Linda 's only a year younger than me, she 's always looked youthful, and now I 'd wa ger she could pass for late forties. She squints, sharpening the pierce of her brown eyes. " This is exactly why I did n't want you here. We 're not getting back together, Paul. " " I know that. I do n't want to, " I say. " Just talk to me a minute. " She comes into the study w ith a huff -- " One m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk. I used to love working here together, our fingers ham m ering at our keyboards in a seductive kind of call-and-response. I swivel slowly back and forth in my big chair, staring at the gaps in my book collection, the parts of the alphabet she has boxed somewhere in stor age. I point at Reform or Revolution. " Remem ber w hen I bought that for you, the Luxem burg? " She turns and picks it up off the shelf. The spine is heavily creased, like it m ight break if som eone so m uch as coughed near it. I bought it for her in a used bookstore in Boulder. The previous owner 's ink ran blue all over the margins. She flips through the pages, smiling. " Poor Rosa. " " You forgot to take it. " " You keep it, " she says. " I rem em ber well enough. " " Do you? " " You want to quiz me about the dialectic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but does n't put it back on the shelf. She holds it in her hand as if maybe she will take it with her after all. She looks at her wrist, but she 's not wearing a watch. " I told you I did n't want to do this. I want a clean break. " " There 's no such thing. We have a history. " " What do you want from me? " " Who is he? " " Who? " " The guy you 're seeing. I saw you having dinner together. That night you said you were coming here but did n't. " She thinks a long moment, trying, I imagine, to conjure that winter night. " Richard? I 'm not seeing him, " she says. " He was interviewing for a position. " " There 's a hiring freeze, " I say. " He 's taking my place, " she says quickly. " What are you talking about? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you. I just... I was offered a job in New York. At Columbia. I 'm taking it. " " You 're leaving the university? You 're leav ing Kansas? " " I could n't tu rn it down, you know that. Ivy League, Paul, " she says, smiling now, as if expecting me to congratulate her. " Besides, I need a new start. " I sit there, silent, trying to imagine her stroll ing along Broadway instead of Massachusetts Street. Impossible. W hen I finally respond, I do n't tell her not to leave or that I 've been let go by the university. W hen I speak, I describe everything I remember from the day we filed past Fred Hampton 's coffin in Chicago. I ask if she remembers. " Of course, " she says. " That 's when we left. " " What happened to us? " " W hat do you m ean? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, what happened to us. " " We grew up. " She raises the book, its red cover showing a picture of Luxemburg. " Is this what you wanted? She was killed by reaction aries and dumped in a canal. We were training ourselves to shoot guns. The Panthers were storing bombs in the housing projects. What did we think was going to happen? You do n't win an arms race against the Pentagon. " " Maybe I would n't have gone underground, maybe I would n't have set bombs -- " " Do you actually wish you had? " " -- but I never would have ended up like this if it were n't for you. " She pushes herself off the desk, looming large above me in the chair. " You 're fooling yourself. Even then you did n't have it in you. You w ant to know why we did n't go underground? Why we lived in this house? Because you wanted this, too, you just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it happen. " " That 's not true. " " You let me be your excuse to leave the movement, just as you let me getting hired here be your excuse to not finish your dissertation. You 've used me to not be accountable for deci sions you could n't make and now you 're blam ing me for it. " " You 're wrong, Linda. " " You could n't even leave me when you were miserable. " " I would have. " " Because you 're a coward. " " I am not. " " You 're craven and you always were. " It 's the small laugh after she says this that sends me out of the chair, my hand reaching back as I rise. The force of the slap sends her to a crouch, holding her face. I 'm saying her name, touching her shoulder -- " Linda, are you okay? Linda, I 'm so sorry " -- when she springs from the floor, her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the head and sends me backward a few steps. We are looking at each other, silent, stunned, and below us the book lies open on the floor, pages sticking out, half torn from the binding.
