1018241 I am a normal divorced Beverly Hills housewife, but I am visited by visions and dreams. <p> Like tonight, after pajamas and toothbrushing, I finally corral my ten-year-old Benjy into his upper bunk. Just as I 'm heading downstairs, deciding whether to collapse on the couch with the February issue of Vogue or be a good American and watch the Winter Olympics, I hear a loud " Fuck! " and the sound of wheels on the dining room table. My own shadow -- my fears, hatreds, and ugly little habits all manifested in a rude teenaged boy -- comes flying into the foyer on a skateboard. He wears baggy jeans, suspenders, a long-sleeved red T-shirt. He 's skinny, with a buzz haircut and zits on his face and neck. " Shhhh! " I hiss, running down the last few steps. <p> He whirls around on the board, one end tilted up. " Whadd'you want, babe? " <p> Babe. What I want is this nasty punk out of my house, but I 'm momentarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me babe. <p> My shadow ca n't hold still. He pops gum, farts loud and long, skates off into the living room, around the sofa, across the glass coffee table, knocking over a tall lamp. " Cool it, " I yell. " That lamp was expensive! " He swings on a silk drape with his sneaker laces flying through the air. When the drape tears, he lands again on the skateboard, skids up to the bookshelf, grabs the silver picture frame with the photo from our trip to Aspen. <p> " Hey, who 's this bald asshole? " <p> It 's my ex-husband, Ron. <p> My shadow chucks our last intact-family photo into the foyer, where it cracks on the marble floor. He whizzes into the den and back again, skates a loop-de-loop right over the living room ceiling, laughing like a hyena. Then he jumps off the board, catching it in his hand, and looks at me, all mock-seriousness. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight. " Then he 's off again, roaring with laughter, pounding on drums, pulling maracas out of the air way before I can tackle and immobilize him like I want to. " YO MAMA! " he screams, " YOU 'RE BORING! YOU 'RE OLD! AND YOU 'RE FUCKING GETTING FAT! " <p> He jumps over an armchair, rotates the board in a three-sixty, and sails through the living room window, a great crash of shattered glass in his wake. I hear a motorcycle engine rev, then fade in the direction of Sunset. <p> " Hey, Mom, " Benjy calls from upstairs. " What is that? " <p> " Nothing. My shadow. Go to sleep. " <p> I lie in bed, feeling like I was kicked in the gut. What would some stupid teenager understand about what it 's been like these three years since Ron left? As if he 'd know how it feels to have said " till death do us part " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wait tables while he gets his law degree. Help him become a big, fancy divorce lawyer who so thoroughly thrills some twenty-five-year-old TV actress with her property settlement she invites him to move in. As if it 's not enough that I drag myself out of bed every day, keep this household running, get Benjy to school, soccer practice, doctors and dentists, and through his homework each night. What else am I supposed to do, swim the English Channel? <p> I worry how long it 'll take to get a glazier to the house. And who cleans skidmarked ceilings? But finally I sleep, and when I wake up, I find the glass repaired, the lamp upright, the drapes untorn. The only thing broken is that photo of Benjy, Ron, and me -- and really, that had to go soon anyway. Benjy 's at the kitchen island eating cereal. He does n't seem to remember the noise. Fortunately, he 's a good sleeper, a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear of the dark. I stroke his stick-straight auburn hair that he insists on wearing long in front, even though it falls into his eyes. Thank God, Benjy looks more like me than like Ron, so I tend to feel pity for him rather than anger. <p> In the evening, Benjy and I watch Ace Wands on an MTV interview. I know I 'm a lousy parent letting him see that stuff, but I hate sitcoms. And I 'm interested in what groups the kids like these days. <p> Ace Wands is a heavy-metal drummer in a band called the I-Beams. The I-Beams play loud, driving, white man 's rock ' n ' roll that 's screeched out of portable radios at every construction site in Los Angeles. On their music video, you see Ace Wands 's black, shaggy head whipping back and forth over a skinny neck, a red leather studded jacket, and a massive silver drumset. Every so often, the camera zooms in on black eyeliner melting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale, sunken cheeks. Ace Wands does n't look much different from every other Hollywood rocker who 's making millions in CD sales and spending them on coke and crystal meth, Jack Daniel 's and vintage cars. Really, the only thing that distinguishes Ace is that she is a woman -- a thirty-six-year-old woman -- and a mom. <p> No one knows who fathered the girl, but Ace 's daughter, Lassie( yes, named for the dog), is in Benjy 's fifth-grade class at El Rodeo Elementary. Lassie and Ace live undisputedly outside the district, up in the Hollywood Hills. Yet even though we 've had crackdowns on parents using fake Beverly Hills addresses to get their kids into our schools, and last year the board expelled the children of an entire Iranian clan who claimed residence in a bachelor apartment on South Doheny, I 've never heard anyone question Lassie Wands 's enrollment. Maybe the El Rodeo administrators are too scared to take on Ace -- they do n't want a video released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspired to give the kid a break, figuring she sorely needed a safe environment. Anyway, those of us who serve on the P.T.O. know not to bring up the Lassie issue at meetings. I 'm just glad Benjy is a boy, so there 's no possibility of play dates chez Wands. There was a birthday party for Lassie a couple of years ago, and when I picked Benjy up, Steven Tyler of Aerosmith was singing to the kids in the breakfast nook, holding a banana to his big, obscene mouth like it was the mike, while the little boys played air guitar and the girls swooned. <p> Benjy 's always happy to see a classmate 's mom or dad on TV or in a movie, so he 's attentive to the Ace Wands interview. The V-J, a coffee-skinned girl with dreadlocks and a British accent, compliments Ace on the lyrics for the I-Beams hit " From the Other Side, " a song about being dead. Ace denies she wrote anything. She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her interviewer giggles and challenges the plausibility of John, dead or alive, ever crossing over into heavy metal. <p> Ace is fiery. " Oh, John 's into metal, all right. Now that he 's free from that vampire Yoko and her stay-in-bed-all-day shit! " MTV bleeps out the last word. " What a fucked-up scene! " Bleep. " The bitch bled the rock ' n ' roll right out of him! " The V-J struggles, tries to keep the interview under control. What comes across clearly is Ace 's conviction. She 's repellent, and I would n't want her on my show, but she obviously believes in what she 's doing, which is more than I can say for a lot of people. <p> Benjy is now tittering over the bad words, and I make him shut off the set. He needs to get to bed early because tomorrow is his class camping trip, and yours truly has volunteered as a parent chaperone. I go to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep well. I twist around in my sheets and dream that I 'm still married to Ron, except we 've both died. I go to heaven, but it 's Jewish heaven, and the only person I see is my great uncle Sherman. Shermie 's eating chopped liver on a cracker, and his hand shakes as he pulls it toward his liver-colored lips. " Where 's Ron? " I ask him. He ignores my question and tries to hand me a cracker. " Sherman, where 's Ron? " I feel frantic, like I am losing everything I ever wanted. My uncle stops chewing, scowls, and says, " Ron 's in shiksa heaven with the actress -- what did you think? " <p> I am sweating in my sleep, and I imagine I feel Ron next to me. But as I awaken to the three a.m. darkness, my temperature drops. I 'm shivering, and my mind races. I remind myself that we are both still alive, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms are probably wrapped around the smooth, aerobics-and yoga-trained figure of his blond girlfriend. You 'd think in Beverly Hills I 'd be used to it, but I can never grasp how someone just exchanges a lover, the way they 'd trade in their old Mercedes for a new SUV. In the three years I 've been alone, no one has touched my skin aside from my massage therapist, and sometimes even that makes me weep. <p> I try not to be too cynical, but I also do n't lie to myself. Vicki Schifter is my best friend because it 's convenient for both of us. The Schifters split up the same year that Ron left me, and after a bitter battle, she kept the house two blocks away from us on North Beverly. Her oldest son, Mike, is the same age as Benjy, and through our involvement in fundraising events at the school, Vicki and I have managed to place Benjy and Mike with the best teacher each year. Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after our divorces, so we naturally fell in with one another. We sample restaurants, go to movies, and double up with an exercise trainer. About twice a year, we park our kids with their respective dads and spend a week at a spa in Arizona or fly to London to shop. Vicki 's a nice enough person, not brilliant or deep, but I 'm not exactly living a scintillating life either. Anyway, I am more annoyed than hurt when Vicki calls early in the morning, full of apologies. <p> " Yes, Marsha, I know I was the one to talk you into it, into doing it together, but honey you 'll have fun on the campout anyway -- I mean, the kids are terrific.... No, I ca n't postpone this, you know full well that a sudden opening with Dr. Kleinbaum is like an early decision acceptance from Stanford -- you take it! " <p> Vicki is abandoning me for liposuction, and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new man. I can deal with my demotion -- I was expecting it sooner or later, but I do n't relish being stranded with eighteen ten-year-olds, headed for the Santa Monica Mountains. " So who 'll replace you? " I ask. <p> " Honey, I 've been calling all the parents, there 's a few ' maybes ' in the works, but -- " Vicki sounds blurrier than her usual supermom self, like she 's avoiding something. " Darling, talk to Miss Clay. She 's on it, and, well, I 'm having surgery in a couple of hours, I have to go. I know you 'll do great. " She practically hangs up on me. <p> Benjy 's teacher, Miss Clay, is a tough old lady whom all the kids pretend to despise but secretly love. She is strict, demanding, and fair. She has devoted her adult life to imparting the fifth-grade curriculum to nearly three generations of Beverly Hills children. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of doors, and that 's made clear to the parents each year when the fifth-grade campout is planned. " The School Board can fire me if they wish, " she always says, knowing the board would prefer to clone her. Anyway, I was perfectly happy to chaperone the group with Vicki, who is competence personified. Now I call Miss Clay to hear Plan B. <p> She orders me to arrive at the north side of the parking lot at four p.m. sharp and congratulates me that it 's not raining as it did for the past two years. She explains that dinner and breakfast packages will be furnished by Alexandra Goldman-Ferguson 's parents, who own a catering company, and she commands me to oversee campsite cleanup lest the school lose its deposit. And will Mrs. Wands and I please keep a record of any troublemakers, since field trip conduct is graded on the children 's end-of-the-year report cards? <p> " Mrs. Wands! " But Miss Clay has hung up. I throw my portable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wallpaper. Two small batteries plop on the carpet. <p> Less than twelve hours from now, I am going to be all alone at some campsite with that lunatic drummer and Benjy 's entire class. I 'm furious at Vicki who surely knew this morning what she was leaving me with, but I feel even greater rage toward Ron. For abandoning us. For abandoning me -- if he were a decent man, he 'd be on this goddamned trip, too. Then Benjy knocks at the door and pushes in. " Mom, I ca n't find my hiking boots. " Having a kid forces you to handle situations when normally it would be wiser to have a nervous breakdown. <p> I show up at the north side of the parking lot at four p.m. sharp, frazzled from a day of worrying. There 's a yellow school bus with its engine idling, a sleeping driver inside, and the Ferguson Catering van parked nearby. No kids, no Ace. I have a flash of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died in surgery) and the trip is canceled. Then I hear a burst of shrieks, and a flock of fifth graders zooms toward the bus, loaded with backpacks, sleeping bags, windbreakers tied around their waists. I pick out Benjy in his orange T-shirt, oversized army pants, and unlaced sneakers. He waves, then returns immediately to his conversation with Tai Schwartz. I take his cue and do n't go over to hug him. Lassie trails behind the group, dreamily. With her curly, honey-colored hair and broad, open face, she could n't be more different from her mother, who must have slept with some Scandinavian pretty-boy the night she conceived. I gather my bed roll and the small duffel packed with one-night necessities. Though there are three times as many seats as we need, fights break out over who sits in the back seat, and which children will get the front, right behind the driver who is now thoroughly awake. " Quiet! " I say and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and back seats. I figure I can avoid Ace Wands for as long as possible by stationing her at the opposite end of the bus, maximum child supervision being the rationale. If she even shows up. I have already decided that eighteen children single-handed is better than eighteen children plus a death-obsessed rock drummer. But a black 1969 Mustang convertible pulls into the parking lot. Ace raises the top, grabs a black bag from the trunk, and lopes toward us. <p> Have you ever seen the coyotes slinking down the street at night, like they sometimes do in our neighborhood when food is scarce in the hills? Thin and hungry, they hunt opossums, alley cats, or small dogs. This is Ace Wands as she approaches the bus. <p> When frightened, babble. " Hi, I 'm Marsha Weisberg, perhaps you remember, we met when Lassie had her eighth birthday party. Of course that was two years ago -- " I vomit words on her. " Well, it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short notice, I mean if your life is anything like mine I 'm sure you 're really busy -- " I sound ridiculous. " I thought it would be a good idea to man the front and back seats and keep the kids in between -- " I suddenly worry I 'll offend her by assigning her to the back of the bus. Similar cases have gone to the Supreme Court. " I just happen to have put myself up here to start -- we can switch tomorrow for the ride home. Or if you want, I 'll sit in the back now -- " <p> " I 'm not Rosa Parks. Can I get in? " I 've been standing in her way all this time, unconsciously blocking her entrance. I step back and shower her with apology. She walks by, silent. I notice she reeks of smoke. And that she read my mind. <p> Our campground is more like a camping theme park than the real thing. There 's a concrete-lined fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which should light with one match. Split log benches ring the fireplace at a safe distance. Several yards away is a row of khaki-colored four-man tents, flaps open and net screens zippered, all aired out and ready for the children. I am relieved to see two pup tents marked STAFF in red letters side-by-side behind the larger tents. Thank God, I do n't have to sleep with Ace Wands. A well-manicured gravel path leads through some sycamores to bathrooms with flush toilets, hot- and cold-water sinks, showers, and electrical outlets. Really, I am grateful to avoid any encounter with true wilderness tonight. <p> Unloading proceeds smoothly, the driver helps. Ace unpacks dinner picnic boxes while I assign kids to their tents, boys on one side, girls on the other. The Goldman-Fergusons ' meals require no cooking, though they are incomprehensibly disgusting to most of the children : salmon mousse, prosciutto and melon, bruscetta, asparagus vinaigrette-what was the chef thinking? Even Ace laughs when Lassie pulls a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say, much of dinner gets thrown into the capacious trash and recycling bins, but when Ace starts the campfire with her silver cigarette lighter, the children roast marshmallows and gorge on s'mores. <p> Just as the rise in ten-year-old blood sugar threatens mass delirium, State Park Ranger Ariel arrives with a guitar, camp songs, and ghost stories. He leads us on a night walk, shines a flashlight on annoyed owls, and points out the Big Dipper. He helps us herd the kids into tents and bids us goodnight until seven a.m. when he 'll be back to help " break camp. " <p> Now Ace and I sit alone by the fire, and neither of us speaks. It 's uncomfortable. At least, I 'm uncomfortable. Ace seems relaxed. She stares into the flames and lights a cigarette. I 'm the one agonizing about the lack of conversation and the no-smoking rule on school field trips. As if I 'm really going to challenge this woman. She crouches on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's boots pointed forward, elbows on the knees of her black jeans. She 's pushed up the sleeves of her black turtleneck. Her forearms are huge, muscled from all that drumming. They look like she could knock me out with one punch. She pulls a slim silver flask from one boot, tips her head back, swallows. Another El Rodeo no-no. I breathe deeply and promise myself I 'll draw the line when the hypodermic appears. <p> Giggling, rustling, scurrying sounds come from the tents. " Kids, " I warn, " time to calm down now. " A few minutes later, " I 'm not happy about how late it is. Go to sleep. " I walk by the tents and catch Angie Michaelson sneaking behind the boys ' side. When I sit down again, one boys ' tent starts to howl like dogs ; some girls answer. I fear patrol duty may continue all night. <p> Finally, Ace flicks the butt into the fire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tents, up into the trees, and out across the entire mountain range. " YOU MOTHERFUCKING RAT 'S ASS CHILDREN SHUT THE HELL UP RIGHT NOW OR NO ONE GOES HOME ALIVE! " <p> Total silence. Ace grabs a flashlight and thrusts it into each tent. She pulls Jason Lee out of a girls ' tent, a porno magazine from the hands of Tai Schwartz. " EACH OF YOU, " she shouts, " IN YOUR OWN TENT. IN YOUR OWN SLEEPING BAG. NO SMOKING! NO JERKING OFF! NO FINGERFUCKING! NO BLOWJOBS!... GET IT? " She storms off to the bathroom. <p> This is not a form of youth leadership I normally condone. I dread what the kids will tell their parents tomorrow, and I anticipate interrogation from the P.T.O. Of course, I am consoled by the thought that the consequences might be exclusion from further chaperoning. And it 's been five minutes with not even a peep from the children. Ace comes back. She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly, her other hand fidgeting with a wooden stick. I am starting to want a cigarette, even though I quit when I was twenty-six and I 've worked on the Roxbury Park " Let 's Beat Cancer " Carnival each spring for the past eight years. <p> If someone does n't speak, I think I 'll implode. <p> " Well. I guess that 's one way to whip them into shape. " <p> Ace grants me a nod. <p> " You do n't mince words, " I continue. " We saw the interview last night. " <p> She exhales a long stream of smoke, turns her head sideways and spits. " They wo n't be asking me back soon. " <p> I tell her I do n't think so. " After all those expletives and bleeps and the mortification of the V-J, every kid in America will tune in next time Ace Wands hits MTV, and every parent will watch just to be outraged. " <p> For the first time, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know, Marsha, I thought you were a Rodeo Drive ding-bat who only talked shit. But you may be right. " <p> What a compliment. I 'm in. I feel like Barbara Walters when she gets her guest to cry. " So what 's your next project? " <p> White powder must have gone up her nose in the latrine, because Ace is animated. She stirs circles in the air in front of her, describing her upcoming CD. It 's titled Rings of Hell, based on Dante 's Inferno. " I had to go solo, " she says. " My band members are a bunch of brainless pederasts who covet underage pussy and ca n't grasp the concept. But the label is behind me, I mean, the suits at Columbia know dead and damned speaks to L.A. teenagers. " She claims that even Robert Pinsky, the U.S. poet laureate and Dante 's most recent translator, has offered a short essay for the CD package calling rock ' n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shakes her head. " Of course, Columbia could give a fuck about Pinsky. They want lurid graphics -- tortured souls, half-naked, bound and pierced. They want a full-length animated video. I 'm going to direct it myself. Shit, this is Hollywood, not Florence. " <p> I surprise myself with a strange question. " Have you, uh, communicated with Dante? " <p> " Fuck, no! " Ace yells, and I recoil. " Are you kidding? Hypocrite pig asshole wo n't talk to me. Wo n't talk poetry with a chick. " She snorts and lights another cigarette. <p> " Anyway, " she continues, " I 've fixed him. " In her Inferno, she 's replaced Virgil with " Virgin, " a sixteen-year-old beauty who 's died untouched. " It 's better for the kids like this. You got ta get the story down to their stoned-out, maniacal, masturbating level, you know? " <p> I think of Benjy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I guess if I 'm lucky, he wo n't join a gang. Non-addictive drug use and sexual obsession is starting to sound like a reasonable prospect. " Okay. But a virgin in hell? " <p> " What are you, stupid? Think of the metaphor. The person who 's been given a life, but does n't touch anything, does n't taste anything, does n't fuck anything. Here 's this angel of a girl who 's got her whole damned high school coming in its pants, and she 's not spreading ' em, like it 's some kind of power trip. Sits around with her tight ass, too good to give. All that life. All those hormones... So she 's hit by a car, dies a virgin, and goes to the bottom ring of Hell, where she 's stalked eternally, by the way, by Mister Dante-the-fucking-Poet himself. " Ace drags hard on her cigarette, turns her shaggy head to survey the tents. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell these kids it 's this. Live. Just fucking live. Do n't hold onto it as if you could store it up. I know enough of us on the other side of this mortality equation, and half are rotting with regret. Life is now. Do n't fucking waste it. " <p> I feel my eyes widen. The campfire flames jump and flicker. <p> It 's late, and the kids will start waking up around six-thirty. I mumble something about sleep and take my toiletry case to the bathroom. The dim fluorescent bulb buzzes overhead, and something feels different. I look into the mirror over one of the sinks, and I do n't see my own face, I see Ron 's. I notice his tanned, well-formed lawyer 's jaw, the Dodgers cap he started wearing when he began cheating on me, the new Polo shirt -- probably a gift from the girlfriend. But what chills me and sickens me, even more than the midnight appearance of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park campground, is the expression on his face. It 's that expression, the look of pity, guilt, and evasion he had the day he left. <p> It had taken my gynecologist, Gillian, to finally enlighten me. " Oh God, Marsha, " she said, pushing her glasses up on her head, " you do n't get chlamydia from nowhere. Ron did n't get it from nowhere. " She looked like she felt just awful. " I 'm so sorry. I thought you knew. I see them all over town together... " <p> I called Ron from her office and told him to meet me at home in ten minutes or I 'd change the locks. I did n't mean that I was going to throw him out. I meant that I was going to threaten, scream and cry, demand he break off his affair that instant and start marital counseling the next day. But when I got home, he was already there, sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had that expression on his face. He felt sorry for me, and guilty. He was trying to hide how relieved he was, glad that finally he could leave. It was like my breathing stopped when I saw that pitying, evasive expression on his face. Just by looking at him, I knew the whole deal. He would give me the house. He would give me custody of Benjy. He would give me anything I could possibly want or need, anything except for himself. And now, here we are, three years later, and I 'm still watching his rich, guilty eyes trying to slink away. I tear without really crying, and I retch, but nothing comes up. <p> " JESUS FUCKING CHRIST, DID YOU EVER THINK OF LOOKING IN ANOTHER MIRROR? " <p> It 's Ace 's voice, but when I whirl around, she 's not there. I hold my hand to my chest, gasp and then wipe my eyes. I grab my toothbrush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on white porcelain and the steel drain as I brush my teeth. I run cool water over my fingers, breathing. I consider not looking up at all, but curiosity overwhelms me, and -- thank God -- it 's only me in the glass. <p> My face is still shocked and frightened. My hazel eyes are wide, bright from the tears. There are red splotches on my neck and cheeks. I dampen my towel and press it to my skin. " It 's all right, " I whisper to myself, as if I were Benjy, smoothing my hair to curve it under my chin. The muscles in my neck soften, begin to relax. " It 's all right, " I say again. I gaze at my reflection. Considering what 's just happened, I do n't look so bad. In any city other than Beverly Hills, someone might notice me as an attractive woman. <p> On the way back to my pup tent, I pass the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her boot. " Listen... " I want to ask her something. " About your video. Before I married Ron, I started a degree in animation. Of course, I never even graduated, but in school I made this little cartoon that won some prizes, even got shown at local festivals... <p> " Well, I was wondering if -- and I do n't expect any money for this or anything -- but I was wondering if... " Jesus Christ, I tell myself, spit it out. <p> " Marsha, spit it out. " <p> Ace startles me, but I do n't back down. " Perhaps I could help with your Inferno project. " <p> Ace steps away from the fire and stands close to me. " Why do you want to? " <p> Because I 've been wanting to get back to filmmaking for years? Because I 'm curious to see how far rock ' n ' roll can be pushed as a literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who reads your mind. " Because I 'm bored. No, it 's worse than that. Because I 'm boring. I do n't want to be boring for the rest of my life. " <p> " Fuck. You can work for me if you want. But, you know, Marsha, you do n't have to work for that. " Ace grins. She puts one hand on her hip and tilts her head. I look at her chiseled cheeks and mop of black hair, her thick eyebrows and nearly black irises. Her mouth is relaxed, and I notice its full shape for the first time, puffy and ripe-looking, almost trembling. I do n't move away when she reaches one knuckly drummer hand behind my neck, pulls me toward her and kisses my lips. I smell cigarettes and wood smoke, I taste whiskey. " Goodnight, " she says in her rough voice. <p> I vibrate in my tent, happy Ace is close by, yet relieved I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, too, knowing Chelsea Allen sleeps only a few yards away, yet grateful that boys and girls are safely separated. Now I wish I 'd drunk Ace 's whiskey, brought an Ambien, not eaten so much chocolate. I run my finger over my mouth, feeling with the bottom lip my soft, plush fingertip and the hardness of my nail. I remind myself that no one contracts AIDS from kissing. It takes me two hours to fall asleep. <p> Morning is a blitz of pancakes and sausage, tofu links for the vegetarian kids. Ace is not a morning person, and no one sees her until after Lassie has taken a cup of black coffee to her tent. Park Ranger Ariel turns up early as promised, and he stays by my side until the tents are cleared out and all children and gear are packed into the bus. Without conferring, I sit in the back, and Ace takes the front. Everyone is sleepy, the ride home quiet. <p> We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nannies, chauffeurs, and Miss Clay. " The children were a delight, " I report. I 'll never volunteer for this again. Ace plows through the crowd mechanically, in dark sunglasses, saying nothing, the way she probably leaves a concert stadium, escaping groupies. She waits by her car with her strong arms folded, while Lassie sorts her backpack and sleeping bag from a big pile on the ground. I excuse myself from chatting with Renata Goldman-Ferguson, and I approach Ace. I am determined to make some contact, although morning-after awkwardness has left me even less comfortable in her presence than I was the previous afternoon. I decide to be polite and treat her the way I 'd treat any of the other class parents. " It was really good of you to come, " I say. " Thanks for your help. " <p> She breaks out laughing in my face. " Hey, the pleasure was mine. " She lights a cigarette and leans against the hood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. She smokes and grins at me. <p> I turn and rejoin the group, a surge of adrenaline tinting my cheeks. I feel her black eyes on my back, lower maybe, and I take care not to stumble or sway too much as I walk. <p> Though Benjy is overtired, I let him stay up to watch the Winter Olympics. We chew pizza through a report on the Slovakian luger who recovered from brain surgery and won the bronze. They broadcast a long stretch of the Canada vs. Finland hockey game, but no one scores. When the women 's figure skating finals come on, I perk up. The fifteen-year-old Korean favorite performs nearly flawlessly but then falls hard during her last triple toeloop. An athletic Russian completes all her technical elements, but the transitions are sloppy, and her scores reflect her lack of artistry. A low-ranking Swiss pixie impresses the judges with solid jumps and crisp footwork, and she unexpectedly moves into first place. <p> " Well, this certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fleming reports breathlessly. <p> " That 's the Olympics, Peggy, " says Scott Hamilton, the first man to perform a back flip on ice. " You never know what 's going to happen until it does happen. " <p> There is a break for Internet trading and Mountain Dew commercials, and then we are back in the arena. I am in the arena, on the ice. I scrape backward crossovers to gain speed. I smell metal and sweat. The music swells, and as it hits a crescendo I leap into the air, rotating madly. I land the triple lutz, jam my toe pick into the ice, push off and rotate three times again. <p> " A perfect triple-triple combination! " gushes Peggy Fleming. <p> For a split second I worry about the effect my unbounded psyche has on my son, but he seems excited. I suppose Benjy 's so accustomed to watching his friends ' parents dive out of airplanes on the movie screen, score three-pointers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question his mother 's appearance in the Olympics. <p> Meanwhile, I 'm nearly flying, to the roar of applause and Tchaikovsky 's Fifth. I nail my double axle, whip through an intricate footwork sequence, glide sideways spread eagle, my legs taut as bowstrings. Another triple-double salchow-flip combination and I 've made it through the tough technical jumps. The rest is all showmanship. I hit the top of each Russian split jump just as the cymbals clash. I tear backward as fast as I can. I smile into the bleachers, my heart pumping, and the spotlight races to keep up with me. I stretch my left leg behind me, balance on the right, then I suddenly switch direction and leap head first into the flying camel spin. I whirl, hovering over my spinning silver blade, my left leg my axis, my right leg and left arm extended parallel to the gleaming surface of the ice. The spotlights lower, and my shadows grow long, spanning the oval rink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond my circle of blinding starlight, the audience is on its feet, cheering. Peggy Fleming broadcasts over the din that I have come out of nowhere and at thirty-nine years old have won the Olympic gold medal, beaten the Russians, the fifteen-year-old Korean, the Swiss pixie, the whole damned lot of them. " THIS IS FUCKING AMAZING! " Peggy Fleming shouts. <p> " HOLY SHIT! " says Scott Hamilton. " We are witnessing ice skating history right before our eyes! " <p> Even the editors and engineers at NBC-TV are so blown away by this incredible, historic Olympic performance they forget to bleep out the curse words. <p> Benjy leaps from the den carpet and high-fives me. I see pride and exhaustion in his eyes. " Way to go, Mom! " Then he lets out a sigh, an exhalation that betrays years of frustration, impatience, shame. " Finally. " <p> <p> By Valerie Ann Leff <p>
