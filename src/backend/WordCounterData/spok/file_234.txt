4172841 @!ANTHONY-MASON# Four point two. @!GAYLE-KING# Two. @!ANTHONY-MASON# Wow. @!GAYLE-KING# Yep. @!ANTHONY-MASON# All right. Welcome back to CBS THIS MORNING. We got Judd Apatow in the greenroom here this morning. He 'll be joining us shortly. But right now, it 's time to -- there he is, checking up on the news. Somebody still reads the newspaper. @!GAYLE-KING# What 's you 're reading, Judd? Yes. @!ANTHONY-MASON# Right now it 's time to show you some of this morning 's headlines. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette remembers pioneering transplant surgeon Thomas Starzl. He died in his sleep Saturday at his home in Pittsburgh. Strazl performed the first successful liver transplant on a human patient in 1967. He transformed the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center into the busiest transplant center in the world. He was also a leading researcher into anti- rejection drugs that saved the lives of thousands. Thomas Starzl, after an incredible life, died at ninety years old. @!GAYLE-KING# Wow. The Wall Street Journal says more charity officials are receiving million-dollar paydays. About twenty-seven hundred employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more back in 2014 and that 's up a third from 2011. High pay at charities has drawn scrutiny some -- from some lawmakers because the groups received significant tax breaks. @!NORAH-O'DONNELL# USA Today is tracking the effects of an unseasonably warm February. Spring-like conditions arrived twenty-two days early in Washington, DC. The famed cherry trees might blossom earlier than ever. Pollen will bother allergy sufferers ten to twenty days sooner in some areas. It was the warmest February ever in more than two hundred and seventy cities. @!ANTHONY-MASON# Wow. The New York Times says the U.S. Soccer Federation is ordering players to stand during national anthems. American midfiller -- midfielder Megan Rapinoe knelt during the U.S. anthem before two games last year. The penalty for breaking the rule is unclear. @!NORAH-O'DONNELL# Helicopter pilot Major Mary Jennings Hegar and her crew were shot down by the Taliban in 2009 during a rescue mission outside Kandahar, Afghanistan. Despite her wounds she fought back and saved the lives of her crew and patients. Major Hegar earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive Disting -- Distinguished Flying Cross with valor for her heroism. @!GAYLE-KING# Major Hegar continued fighting after she returned home and she joined a lawsuit against the longstanding rule that barred women from ground combat positions. @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# My gender has never been a factor in accomplishing my unit 's mission, and it should not be a factor when selecting personnel to serve in combat roles. @!GAYLE-KING# And that rule has since been reversed. Major Hegar discussed her battles in and out of the military in a new book. It 's called Shoot Like a Girl : One Woman 's Dramatic Fight in Afghanistan and on the Home Front. She joins us at the table. I do n't if we should call you miss badass or M.J. @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# M.J. will work. @!GAYLE-KING# Which would you prefer, M.J. Hegar? We 're so delighted to have your book, I have to say is riveting. @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# Thank you. @!GAYLE-KING# Because I look at girls like you -- women like you and think I could never do that. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching Perfect Storm, you see this crash, you go, I want to do that. @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# I did. Yes. I did want to crash into the ocean -- @!GAYLE-KING# Tell us what is -- @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# -- but I did. You know, from watching Han Solo navigate an asteroid field to watching movies like The Perfect Storm, I just -- it would always kind of get my adrenaline up, and I just knew that it was something I wanted to do. @!GAYLE-KING# But you got resistance along the way, starting with very early you get a recommendation from a teacher you think likes you only to find out he 's saying that 's not for a girl. @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# Right. That was the first experience of many where I realized that the vast majority of people that I encountered along the way were very supportive and only cared about whether or not I was competent, but every now and then you got somebody who did n't give you a chance and just want to throw a -- @!ANTHONY-MASON# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of resistance? @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# To be honest with you, even from a young age it just motivated me. It really did. @!ANTHONY-MASON# Mm-Hm. @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# It motivated me. It was almost like a dare. @!ANTHONY-MASON# Yeah. @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# So, just to prove they 're wrong. @!ANTHONY-MASON# I 'm going to show you. @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# Yeah, yeah. @!ANTHONY-MASON# Yeah. @!NORAH-O'DONNELL# Describe what you were doing in Afghanistan, the helicopter you were flying, what your role was. @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# So, I was flying a rescue version of the Black Hawk, most people are familiar with the Black Hawk. It 's called the Pave Hawk. @!NORAH-O'DONNELL# Mm-Hm. @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# And we were supporting the med-evac mission, so just pulling wounded soldiers off the battlefield. @!ANTHONY-MASON# Mm-Hm. @!NORAH-O'DONNELL# How many women are flying those helicopters? @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# More than you might think -- @!NORAH-O'DONNELL# Mm-Hm. @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# -- less than or fewer than it should be. So I -- I mean I had probably two or three in my unit. @!GAYLE-KING# But you take us to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hour you 're shot by the Taliban, your aircraft was riddled with bullets, you landed in the heart of enemy territory and there you are. @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# Right. Yeah. It was a -- at the time it was n't really that scary. It was really just what we were trained to do. And -- and we were just doing our jobs. But it was a -- couple of days later it kind of -- @!GAYLE-KING# You guys killing -- we 're trained to do this. Listen, you had been wounded -- @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# -- sunk in. @!GAYLE-KING# You have been wounded, you 're bleeding. @!ANTHONY-MASON# Yeah. @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# It happened so fast though -- @!GAYLE-KING# Yeah, but -- @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# -- you know. @!GAYLE-KING# -- I 'm always saying, no, we were trained to do that. You say battle readiness has nothing to do with gender and everything to do -- @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# True. @!GAYLE-KING# -- with capability. " @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# Right. I 've seen men and women who were fit for combat that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who I really would n't want to go back into combat with. So it really does n't have anything to do with gender. I feel like I have a warrior 's heart -- @!ANTHONY-MASON# Mm-Hm. @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# -- and it does n't have to do with anything -- @!ANTHONY-MASON# What is a warrior 's heart, by the way? @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# Just a drive to protect people and to -- @!ANTHONY-MASON# Mm-Hm. @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# -- you know, run toward the -- the -- the emergency when everybody else is running away. @!ANTHONY-MASON# Yeah. @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# You know that that 's not something that you can choose to do. It 's just something that you reflex-do, or you don't. @!ANTHONY-MASON# Yeah. @!NORAH-O'DONNELL# Describe the backlash that -- that you experienced while trying to push women into combat roles. @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# It was significant but it 's a very vocal minority. The -- @!NORAH-O'DONNELL# Mm-Hm. @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# -- the vast majority of the messages that I receive are, you know, please keep doing what you 're doing, you 're inspiring my daughter or you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, fighting for us. But there are some really determined people out there who see it very threatening that a woman can do these jobs. @!NORAH-O'DONNELL# And, as you know -- @!ANTHONY-MASON# Does anyone -- @!NORAH-O'DONNELL# -- there were women in combat before they technically opened up -- @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# Absolutely. @!NORAH-O'DONNELL# -- the role to women in combat. @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# And for hundreds of years there have been women in combat -- @!NORAH-O'DONNELL# Right. @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# -- and people have been trying to stop that. @!NORAH-O'DONNELL# Yeah. @!ANTHONY-MASON# Does the military need to do more still? @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# Absolutely. You know, that they 're doing a lot more than they get credit for. And that we have some amazing leaders. But then we have some leaders who turn a blind eye to things that contribute negatively to a really difficult culture for women. @!GAYLE-KING# I love the title of your book, Shoot like a Girl because it sounds it 's a negative thing about girls -- @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# Right. @!GAYLE-KING# -- but the reality is very different of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking the phrase back. @!GAYLE-KING# Yes, yes. @!NORAH-O'DONNELL# Because what does it mean? @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# Yes. In reality and I hate to talk in stereotypes. But, stereotypically, physiologically, women are more -- we 're better predisposed to being marksmen and fighter pilots because of the way we handle Gs and because of our respiration and circulatory system and center of gravity and other -- other factors. @!GAYLE-KING# An instructor said that to you, but -- @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# Yeah. @!GAYLE-KING# -- there 's a great scene in the book where after you all have crashed, there was a big briefing -- people are patting themselves on the back. You 're the only one in the meeting, M.J., that says, basically, where the hell were you, guys? Because you felt you had been left stranded by another group. You 're the only one that stood up. @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# That gets me into trouble a lot. Yeah. I kind of looked around and I ca n't understand why nobody else is speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up I realize why nobody did. But -- but, at the time, I kind of look around like why is n't anyone say anything? I will. @!NORAH-O'DONNELL# This is -- @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# And that 's been my whole life. @!NORAH-O'DONNELL# Your book has been optioned for a movie several times. @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# It has, yes. @!GAYLE-KING# Ah. @!NORAH-O'DONNELL# And what 's the latest on that? @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# Tristar has it. Angelina Jolie is slated to play me. @!GAYLE-KING# Who? @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# Angelina Jolie. Really excited that Jason Hall, Academy Award-nominated screenwriter from American Sniper, is attached to the project. @!ANTHONY-MASON# Yeah. It would be something to see it up on the screen. It 's true. @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# Yeah. We 're looking forward to it. @!ANTHONY-MASON# All right. Major Mary henning -- Mary Jennings Hegar, M.J., thank you so much for being with us. @!MAJOR-MARY-JENNING# Thank you so much. @!ANTHONY-MASON# Shoot Like A Girl is on sale tomorrow. Top grossing movies like Bridesmaids are among the credits for writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our Toyota Greenroom to explain how he revisited his standup comedy past for his latest project. But, first, a check of your local weather. @!GAYLE-KING# Do n't get -- @( LOCAL WEATHER BREAK) @(ANNOUNCEMENTS)
