4082741 The New Tax Havens( Shachar Bar-On) One Child at a time( Tanya Simon/Catherine Herrick) The Sage of St. Anthony( Peter Radovich Jr.) @!LESLEY-STAHL-@1voi : Corporations are avoiding paying billions of dollars in U.S. taxes by moving their operations to new tax havens like the Swiss town of Zug. So here we are in Zug. : We went there to visit their operations. And we came to see your international headquarters. @!WOMAN : Um, at the moment, my boss is not here. Sorry. @!LESLEY-STAHL-@1voi : She said her boss wasnt there and we should call someone halfway around the world. In Houston? @!WOMAN : Yeah. @!LESLEY-STAHL : Not here? @!WOMAN : No. @!LESLEY-STAHL : But this is the headquarters. @!WOMAN : I know. @!LESLEY-STAHL : And is the CEO here? @!WOMAN : No. *** @!SCOTT-PELLEY-@1voi : Elissa Montanti is unlike almost anyone weve ever met. With the help of some very charitable American doctors, shes changed the lives of more than one hundred kids. Like this one, a boy from Iraq who needed an arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love you, Waad. @!SCOTT-PELLEY-@1voi : Tonight, youll follow his transformation -- @!ELISSA-MONTANTI : Look at him, oh -- @!SCOTT-PELLEY-@1voi : -- which is a wonder to watch. *** @!BOB-HURLEY : Catch it. Face the basket. Make a play. You just got to get up closer, you do nt just say screen, my God, where next? @!STEVE-KROFT-@1voic : This is not a story about a tyrannical coach who churns out athletes at some high school sports factory. Its about values, loyalty, and commitment at a small inner city parochial school that does nt meet anyones idea of what a basketball powerhouse should look like. *** @!STEVE-KROFT : Im Steve Kroft. @!LESLEY-STAHL : Im Lesley Stahl. @!BOB-SIMON- : Im Bob Simon. @!MORLEY-SAFER : Im Morley Safer. @!ANDERSON-COOPER : Im Anderson Cooper. @!SCOTT-PELLEY : Im Scott Pelley. Those stories and Andy Rooney tonight on 60 MINUTES. @!THE-NEW-TAX-HAVENS# @!LESLEY-STAHL : Our government is in knots over ways to lower the federal budget deficit. What if we told you we found a pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could be used to help out? That bundle is tax money not coming in to the IRS from American corporations. One major way they avoid paying the tax man is by parking their profits overseas. Theyll tell you theyre forced to do that because of the thirty-five percent corporate tax rate is high in relation to other countries, and indeed it seems the tax code actually encourages companies to move businesses out of the country. Companies searching out tax havens is nothing new -- in the eighties and nineties there was an exodus to Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, where there are no taxes at all. When President Obama threatened to clamp down on tax dodging, many companies decided to leave the Caribbean. But instead of coming back home, they went to safer havens like Switzerland. @!LESLEY-STAHL-@1voi : Several of these companies came to this tiny dot on the Swiss map called Zug ; a small, quaint medieval town. I do nt think anybodys ever heard of Zug in the United States. : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed off the nearby snow-covered mountains. But Zugs main selling point isnt a view of the Alps. How low are the taxes here? @!HANS-MARTI : Its something between fifteen and sixteen percent. @!LESLEY-STAHL : And in the United States its thirty-five percent. @!HANS-MARTI : I know. Its half, half price. @!LESLEY-STAHL : And do you have the lowest tax rate in Switzerland? @!HANS-MARTI : Most probably, yes. @!LESLEY-STAHL : Most probably, yes. So youre kind of a tax haven within a tax haven? @!HANS-MARTI : Maybe, yes. @!LESLEY-STAHL : Yeah, yeah, yeah. : The population of the town of Zug is twenty-six thousand ; the number of companies in the area -- thirty thousand and growing at an average rate of eight hundred a year. But many are no more than mailboxes. Texas Democratic Congressman Lloyd Doggett questions whether the recent moves of several companies are legit. @!REPRESENTATIVE-LLO : A good example is one of my Texas companies thats been in the news lately, Transocean. @!LESLEY-STAHL-@1voi : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil spill. They moved to Zug two years ago. @!REPRESENTATIVE-LLO : Im not sure they even moved that much. They have about thirteen hundred employees still in the Houston area. @!LESLEY-STAHL : Mm. @!REPRESENTATIVE-LLO : They have twelve or thirteen in Switzerland. @!LESLEY-STAHL : And yet theyre -- they claim -- @!REPRESENTATIVE-LLO : They -- @!LESLEY-STAHL : -- that theyre headquartered over there. @!REPRESENTATIVE-LLO : They claim theyre Swiss. And they claim theyre Swiss for tax purposes. And by doing that, by renouncing their American citizenship, theyve saved about two billion dollars in taxes. @!LESLEY-STAHL : So here we are in Zug. : We went to find their operations here. We came to see your international headquarters. @!WOMAN-# 1 : Um, at the moment my boss is not here so -- @!LESLEY-STAHL-@1voi : She said her boss wasnt there and we should call someone halfway around the world. In Houston? @!WOMAN-# 1 : Yeah. @!LESLEY-STAHL : Not here? @!WOMAN-# 1 : No. @!LESLEY-STAHL : But this is the headquarters. @!WOMAN-# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CEO here? @!WOMAN-# 1 : No. @!LESLEY-STAHL : I mean, normally here? @!WOMAN-# 1 : No. @!LESLEY-STAHL : Okay. : Another Texas company that moved here is Weatherford, a ten- billion-dollar oil field services firm. It still has twenty-eight hundred workers in Houston. But according to official documents, they are incorporated in Zug, in this small building. But there was no Weatherford on the sign outside. Finally found it -- listed in this thing, Weatherford International. Here -- heres the mailbox. But we do nt know even where to go, theres no listing for the international headquarters of Weatherford. : So we started knocking on doors. Hi. @!WOMAN-# 2 :( FOREIGN LANGUAGE) @!LESLEY-STAHL : Were looking for Weatherford. Are they in this building? @!WOMAN-# 2 : Yes. @!LESLEY-STAHL : Here? @!WOMAN-# 2 : Just a moment, please. I have to check it. All right. @!LESLEY-STAHL : Okay. All right. : I was shown to a conference room they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office told us they never go there. So are these big companies pulling a fast one? Well, apparently not, under both Zug and U.S. tax laws, its perfectly legal to get the low tax rate even without a real presence here. But Congressman Doggett wants to change that. You have a proposed legislation that a company will be taxed not based on where they file some pieces of paper, but where their decision makers and management actually resides and makes decisions. @!REPRESENTATIVE-LLO : Let them pay the same way that other Houston- based companies pay. And so if they have their management and control there, they ought to be paying here in the United States. I think its fair. @!LESLEY-STAHL-@1voi : We found that faced with the mere threat of Doggetts legislation, Transocean and Weatherford both recently packed up their top brass and shipped them to Geneva. We were told Transoceans top ten executives live around here in the Geneva area, and work on the top two floors of this building, everyone from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of taxes. : They wouldnt talk to us on camera, and neither would Weatherford. They also moved their CEO and CFO to Geneva. And so now were beginning to see a jobs exodus from the U.S. of top management. @!REPRESENTATIVE-LLO : We cant write a law that their lawyers cant get around. Thats the whole problem here. @!LESLEY-STAHL : Youre in Congress. Why did Congress write these laws that allows this to happen? @!REPRESENTATIVE-LLO : Theres been a lot of arm twisting, a lot of effective lobbying here, and some really smart tax lawyers figuring out how to game the system with one shenanigan after another. @!LESLEY-STAHL : But are they shenanigans, or is it the law? @!REPRESENTATIVE-LLO : I think it was a shenanigan when some of these companies felt so strongly about America that they renounced their American citizenship and began saluting a foreign flag. They exploited a provision in our tax laws and moved offshore. @!LESLEY-STAHL : Congress tried to put a stop to that with a law passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move offshore would still have to pay the thirty-five percent. But because of loopholes in the tax code, companies can substantially lower their taxes by moving chunks of their businesses to their foreign subsidiaries. I think when people hear that all these companies are moving overseas because of taxes, they think that does nt smell right. @!THIERRY-BOITELLE : Yeah, the question is, does a company have a moral obligation to pay its fair share " @!LESLEY-STAHL-@1voi : Swiss tax attorney, Thierry Boitelle. @!THIERRY-BOITELLE : I think many companies in the U.S. would like to keep the jobs in the U.S. if they could, but they also need to keep their shareholders happy. And they are in the U.S. in a -- in a -- in a corporate tax nightmare because its the highest tax rate in the world. @!LESLEY-STAHL-@1voi : With Japan slated to lower its rate in April, the U.S. will soon have the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. @!JOHN-CHAMBERS : We are dealing with a tax system that is a dinosaur. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Chambers, head of Cisco -- the giant high-tech company headquartered in San Jose. He says our tax rate is insane. Its forcing companies into these maneuvers, especially when many other industrialized countries, including Canada, are busy lowering their tax rates in order to lure our companies and our jobs away. @!JOHN-CHAMBERS : Every other government in the world has realized that the U.S. has it wrong. Theyre saying Im going to have lower taxes, period. Thats what you see across all Western Europe, thats what you see in Asia in the developed countries. @!LESLEY-STAHL : Are you judged as a CEO on things like this on taxes? @!JOHN-CHAMBERS : Absolutely. @!LESLEY-STAHL-@1voi : He s been expanding Cisco overseas because of growing demand abroad, but also to lower the companys taxes, their average rate over the last three years was just twenty percent. Economist Martin Sullivan says its standard operating procedure for companies like Cisco. @!MARTIN-SULLIVAN : U.S. multinationals are shifting their research facilities, shifting their manufacturing facilities, and shifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those are massive numbers of jobs. @!LESLEY-STAHL-@1voi : He says Ireland taxes corporations at just a third of the U.S. rate, so no wonder the outskirts of Dublin look like Silicon Valley. These companies are all but obliged to go abroad. @!MARTIN-SULLIVAN : Well, if youre -- have a thirty-five percent rate in the United States and, for example, a 12.5 percent rate in Ireland, theres a( sic) incentive to -- to move your factory to Ireland. @!LESLEY-STAHL : Six hundred American companies are in Ireland -- @!MARTIN-SULLIVAN : Mm-Hm. @!LESLEY-STAHL : -- and they employ a hundred thousand people. @!MARTIN-SULLIVAN : Thats right. @!LESLEY-STAHL : Those are jobs that are nt here. @!MARTIN-SULLIVAN : Mm-Hm. @!LESLEY-STAHL : And they moved to Ireland because of taxes. @!MARTIN-SULLIVAN : Mm-Hm. The U.S. Treasury in effect is subsidizing investment in Ireland. @!LESLEY-STAHL : Why isnt everybody in Ireland if its that great? @!MARTIN-SULLIVAN : Almost everybody is in Ireland ; all the pharmaceutical companies, all the high-tech companies. Youre stupid if youre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an awful lot of companies in Ireland. @!JOHN-CHAMBERS : Yes, we do. @!LESLEY-STAHL : One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight companies in Ireland. @!JOHN-CHAMBERS : Mm-Hm. We do what makes sense to the shareholders. We go where there are incentives in countries that say we want you here, were going to give you tax advantages, and we want you to add jobs here, etc. We can no longer in America say this is how we do it, therefore you must do it. Weve got to change, or were going to be left behind. @!LESLEY-STAHL-@1voi : An increasingly popular way, particularly pharmaceutical and high-tech companies like Google avoid paying the thirty- five percent is to shift their patents, computer code, pill formulas, even logos from their U.S. bases to their outposts in low-tax countries. @!THIERRY-BOITELLE : A hundred years ago, if a company would want to relocate, you know, youd have to pick up a factory, machinery, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today, a company can move predominantly all of its assets just on paper. @!LESLEY-STAHL : You can push a button and move your algorithms, you know, and or on to Switzerland. @!THIERRY-BOITELLE : Or Coca-Cola could take the recipe out of the vault -- @!LESLEY-STAHL : Yeah. @!THIERRY-BOITELLE : -- and put it in a Swiss vault. @!LESLEY-STAHL : Yeah. And then -- and then its Swiss? @!THIERRY-BOITELLE : Yeah. @!LESLEY-STAHL-@1voi : When a formula or a computer code is registered abroad, say in Zug, a U.S. company is allowed to claim that a lot of its taxable profits are there, even if most of its sales are in the U.S. @!MARTIN-SULLIVAN : The need for tax reform is greater than ever. @!LESLEY-STAHL-@1voi : Economist Sullivan told Congress these patents and profit transfers are accounting tricks that allowed companies to chip away at the thirty-five percent and save tens of billions of dollars. He says that from 2007 to 09 these maneuvers helped lower Pfizers average tax rate to seventeen percent ; Merck to 12.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know its really remarkable as I review the data is the consistency with which you see this phenomenon. The taxes are going down. The profits are shifting offshore at an accelerated rate over the last few years. @!LESLEY-STAHL-@1voi : So now these companies have profits accumulating overseas in places like Zug. Oh, look at your clock tower. : If they bring the money home, its taxed at the full thirty- five percent. If they leave it overseas, the IRS cant touch it. In other words, the tax law all but forces companies to keep their money out of the country, indefinitely. @!JOHN-CHAMBERS : We leave the money over there. I create jobs overseas ; I acquire companies overseas ; I build plants overseas ; and I badly want to bring that money back. @!LESLEY-STAHL : How much does your company have overseas that could be brought back? @!JOHN-CHAMBERS : Almost forty billion dollars. Forty billion. @!LESLEY-STAHL : Cisco has forty billion dollars -- @!JOHN-CHAMBERS : Yeah. @!LESLEY-STAHL : -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The total amount of money U.S. companies have trapped overseas is 1.2 trillion dollars. Chambers is advocating for a one-time tax break to allow them to bring that money home at a rate of say five percent. He says that would stimulate the economy and create jobs. @!JOHN-CHAMBERS : What is your downside for money that isnt going to come back anyhow? Id say your downside is zero. @!LESLEY-STAHL-@1voi : But the Obama administration opposes this idea. When it was tried in 2005, the Treasury did rake in billions of dollars, though, very few jobs were created. What -- what if tomorrow -- @!JOHN-CHAMBERS : Mm-Hm. @!LESLEY-STAHL : -- Congress passed a quickie law -- @!JOHN-CHAMBERS : Yeah. @!LESLEY-STAHL : -- and the tax rate was twenty percent? @!JOHN-CHAMBERS : Mm-Hm. @!LESLEY-STAHL : Would that solve everything? @!JOHN-CHAMBERS : I think it is the most important ingredient that we have to think about being competitive. @!LESLEY-STAHL : You lower the rate from thirty-five percent to twenty percent. You lose something like two trillion dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a horrible deficit crisis, debt crisis. @!JOHN-CHAMBERS : Mm-Hm. @!LESLEY-STAHL : Thats -- thats almost too much money to lose. Whats your answer to that? @!JOHN-CHAMBERS : My answers very simply, every other developed country in the world has already done this. Im not asking to give me a favor, or a hand out. @!LESLEY-STAHL : So you know what it sounds it. @!JOHN-CHAMBERS : All were asking is give us a level playing field. Get us close. @!ONE-CHILD-AT-A-TIM# @!SCOTT-PELLEY : Of all the tragedies of war, none are greater than those that involve children. Caught in the crossfire or hit by a roadside bomb, children are often wounded but rarely receive the heroic, high-tech medical care that our troops depend on. Recently, we heard about a woman in Staten Island, New York, who has devoted herself to wounded children. Elissa Montanti has little money and no training in humanitarian relief, but against the odds she has changed the fortunes of more than one hundred crippled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see how she does it, so for four months we followed Elissa Montanti on her journey with one child, a nine year old from Iraq, a boy named Waad. @!SCOTT-PELLEY-@1voi : This is Waad last April when he arrived in America with his mother Waffa. Elissa Montanti brought them here after an American soldier told her Waads story. @!ELISSA-MONTANTI : He was walking with his friends and they were kicking a bottle. I think the first child kicked a bottle and then maybe the second. And then he kicked it and it exploded. @!SCOTT-PELLEY : It was a bomb. @!ELISSA-MONTANTI : It was a bomb. @!SCOTT-PELLEY-@1voi : The blast shattered his face, tore out his eye, and took away his right arm and left leg. Waad would receive treatment for all of those wounds from a network of volunteers and charities that Elissa Montanti has recruited one by one over the last fifteen years. Waads first stop was at the Shriners Hospital in Philadelphia ; Shriners has twenty-two hospitals that provide free care to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are so strong. Very good. @!SCOTT-PELLEY-@1voi : Waad pushed through physical therapy to strengthen his muscles. @!WOMAN-# 1 : Youre going to be Superman. @!MAN-# 1 : Its right here. @!SCOTT-PELLEY-@1voi : But slowed down long enough -- @!MAN-# 2 : He really gets around well. @!SCOTT-PELLEY-@1voi : -- to get fitted for a new arm and leg that the Shriners made for him. Then it was a trip to see an ocular specialist, Annette Kirzrot, who also volunteers for Elissa. A prosthetic eye was the first step in improving Waads appearance. @!ANNETTE-KIRZROT : Happy? @!WAAD : Happy. @!ANNETTE-KIRZROT : Happy. @!WAAD : Happy. @!SCOTT-PELLEY-@1voi : But the tougher part would be reconstructing his face. @!DR-KAVEH-ALIZADEH : Waad, how are you buddy? @!SCOTT-PELLEY-@1voi : That was the challenge for plastic surgeon Kaveh Alizadeh. He s a Long Island volunteer recruited by Elissa. @!DR-KAVEH-ALIZADEH : So theres this increasing pool of people that get drawn into her world. And if you have, if youre lucky or unlucky enough( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get pulled in. Can you blow up your cheeks really big? @(Woman-speaking-for) @!SCOTT-PELLEY : When you first approach a hospital or a doctor to ask them for potentially, hundreds of thousands of dollars in free medical care, whats your pitch? What do you tell them? @!ELISSA-MONTANTI : I tell them this true story. Heres a child thats -- thats battered. I just tell them the reality. I expect them to help. Im grateful because they do nt have to help. But I expect that they would, because how could you not? And you get to feed the elephants. @!SCOTT-PELLEY-@1voi : After the earthquake hit in Haiti, she went to the island and brought back three girls who lost limbs. Elissas work with crippled children began back in 1996 when a friend asked her to raise money to buy school supplies for kids in war-torn Bosnia. That led to a meeting with the Bosnian ambassador to the U.N. @!ELISSA-MONTANTI : And he said to me, you know, quite frankly, we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He reached in his drawer. And he handed me this letter that this boy had written to him asking for help, two new arms and a leg. And I saw his picture. And thats really when my whole life started to change. @!SCOTT-PELLEY-@1voi : She brought that boy to the U.S. for treatment. Kenan Malkic, now twenty-eight, helps Elissa run her tiny charity with a mighty name ; she calls it the Global Medical Relief Fund. Global Medical Relief sounds really big. @!ELISSA-MONTANTI : Its big in the sense that we reach out to the world. But its small in that its really me. @!SCOTT-PELLEY : Maybe you should call it One Little Lady in Staten Island. : She runs Global Medical Relief out of her home, a fifty-seven- year-old single woman with a computer and a phone. @!ELISSA-MONTANTI : My office is my former walk-in closet. And I added a window. And it works. And I speak to the world right out of my walk-in closet. @!SCOTT-PELLEY : The hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Mm-Hm. @!SCOTT-PELLEY : -- come from where? @!ELISSA-MONTANTI : Bosnia, El Salvador, Liberia, Niger, Sierra Leone, Iraq, China, Indonesia, Pakistan, Haiti. Did I say Nepal? @!SCOTT-PELLEY : How do you keep it running? @!ELISSA-MONTANTI : On a prayer. @!SCOTT-PELLEY-@1voi : She simply begs and borrows from doctors and hospitals, whatever it takes. Shes traveled to the Middle East, arranging passports, cutting red tape and getting wounded children out one at a time. Word spread among soldiers in Iraq that an American charity called Global Medical Relief is a lifeline. @!ELISSA-MONTANTI : " We are working in Mosul. " @!SCOTT-PELLEY-@1voi : Now she gets a dozen e-mails a month from the war zone, most of which start with Dear Sir. @!ELISSA-MONTANTI : There are so many. @!SCOTT-PELLEY : How does -- who do these letters end? @!ELISSA-MONTANTI : " Please help. " @!SCOTT-PELLEY-@1voi : It was an e-mail like that that started Waad on his journey with Elissa Montanti. And seven weeks after he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repair his face. He walked into the hospital thanks to his new prosthetic leg. When you first met Miss Elissa, do you remember what she told you that she would do for you? @(Waad-speaking-for) @!MAN-# 1 : He said they will help me to make surgery and fix my arm, leg. @!SCOTT-PELLEY : And make you whole again. @(Man-speaking-forei) @!SCOTT-PELLEY-@1voi : Doctor Alizadehs goal is to minimize the scar that runs from Waads scalp down to his chin. The surgery was done at North Shore University Hospital, which donated its facilities. @!ELISSA-MONTANTI : I love you Waad. @!DR-KAVEH-ALIZADEH : My plan today is to go ahead and expand the skin surrounding the scar, putting a sophisticated tissue balloon underneath the skin where the skin slowly stretches over time. @!SCOTT-PELLEY-@1voi : That sophisticated tissue balloon, implanted under his cheek, will be inflated gradually over the course of weeks. So, over time, theyre going to stretch his skin out essentially creating new skin. @!DR-KAVEH-ALIZADEH : Thats right. @!SCOTT-PELLEY : And then youre going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together? @!DR-KAVEH-ALIZADEH : I -- I hope so. Thats the plan. @!SCOTT-PELLEY : Whats the best you can hope for? @!DR-KAVEH-ALIZADEH : My goal with Waad is that the defects that he has will not be noticeable when he becomes a young man. @!SCOTT-PELLEY : And you have a great deal of confidence in that. @!DR-KAVEH-ALIZADEH : I do. @!SCOTT-PELLEY-@1voi : But Waads appearance would have to become much worse before he had a chance to get better. @(Waad-speaking-for) @!SCOTT-PELLEY-@1voi : During his time here, Elissa arranged for Waad to live alongside the three Haitian girls in temporary housing, a Jesuit retreat on Staten Island. Together, they formed a family, kids who did nt speak the same language helping each other though a painful experience. @!ELISSA-MONTANTI : Waad is coming around the bend. @!SCOTT-PELLEY-@1voi : Even with all the free care, Elissa spends about fifty thousand dollars a year on plane tickets and expenses. She raises it from donors, including Richmond County Savings, a Staten Island bank. But sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who say, look, those kids are from overseas. And wed rather donate our money to kids here in the United States? @!ELISSA-MONTANTI : Often. @!SCOTT-PELLEY : Its a big problem for you? @!ELISSA-MONTANTI : Ive gotten hate mail, you know. @!SCOTT-PELLEY : Oh, my, hate mail. @!ELISSA-MONTANTI : Yeah. You know how can you help children from Iraq when theyre going to grow and just hate the United States. You should help the children here. @!SCOTT-PELLEY : And to those people you would say what? @!ELISSA-MONTANTI : I say we do nt have landmines in this country, thank God. And these children are innocent. @!SCOTT-PELLEY-@1voi : Nearly three months into Waads treatment, the kids went to an amusement park. The balloons under Waads face had been successfully inflated. But, remember, we said things would get worse before they got better. @!WAAD : Good. @!SCOTT-PELLEY-@1voi : This was Waad in June. Imagine what it takes to be a stranger in America and place your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some people need courage for a roller coaster, but Waad sat right up front, to see what its like to be a kid again. @!DR-KAVEH-ALIZADEH : All right. Do you want to just bring him to the room straight? @!MAN-# 3 : Give us a minute. @!WOMAN-# 2 : Ill take him in. @!SCOTT-PELLEY-@1voi : Two days later came his final surgery. @!WOMAN-# 3 : Waad, no -- no pain. @(Waffa-speaking-for) @!SCOTT-PELLEY-@1voi : Over two hours, Doctor Alizadeh removed the balloons from under Waads skin, cut out the scars and joined the new skin together. Plastic surgery requires months of healing, and in recovery Waad had a long way to go. @!WOMAN-# 4 : There you go. There, you can look at mommy. @!SCOTT-PELLEY-@1voi : But for the first time, his mother began to recognize the face she had nt seen in more than two years. @!ELISSA-MONTANTI : Oh, do nt cry. Happy, be happy, okay? @!WAFFA : Thank you. Thank so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!SCOTT-PELLEY : Im curious why you do this. @!DR-KAVEH-ALIZADEH : I do this probably for the most selfish reason, which is that it feels good. What do you think? @!ELISSA-MONTANTI : Well, my charity is very personal. It becomes a global family. All these children, I say " my children " so often, because I feel that that they are, I love all of them. Its more than just an organization that is giving a child a leg or fixing his face. These children go back as little ambassadors. And they tell their town, their village, who say how wonderful the American people are. @!SCOTT-PELLEY-@1voi : In early August, Waad had one more check-up with Doctor Alizadeh. Look at this face, he looks so much better, are nt you handsome. Waad you look so good. : His scars will continue to fade over time, but this isnt the end of Waads treatment. The plan is for him to come back from time to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a smile back. He s got a smile. And I think he un -- understands more English than he used to understand. @!WAAD : Yeah. @!SCOTT-PELLEY : Yeah. I know you understand a lot of it. : Four months after they arrived in America, Waad and his mother headed home to Iraq. Hard to say good-bye? @!ELISSA-MONTANTI : Very hard. I cry all the time. @!SCOTT-PELLEY : You must worry that you wont see him again. @!ELISSA-MONTANTI : I do, because its always that worry what if? You know, what if something happens while theyre in Iraq? What if I cant do this anymore? @!SCOTT-PELLEY-@1voi : A few weeks later, we checked in on Waad back in his neighborhood in Iraq. Thats him in the red shirt. We found the boy whod been disfigured and left to hop on one leg was back with a smile and a pretty solid kick. @!ANNOUNCER : Go to 60minutesovertime.com to hear from the first child Elissa Montanti ever helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most popular sports in the country, and those who follow it on the national level, particularly college scouts and coaches, are familiar with St. Anthony of Jersey City, New Jersey, and its coach, Bob Hurley. Going into this season, St. Anthony had won twenty-three state championships and three national titles under Hurley, who is one of only three high school coaches ever inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. In nearly forty years at St. Anthony, Hurley has never earned more than a nine-thousand-dollar annual stipend, passing up lucrative college jobs to change lives in the inner city and to help save a small struggling Catholic school by putting it on a very big stage. @!STEVE-KROFT-@1voic : One night earlier this month, eight thousand people jammed the Rutgers Athletic Center to watch what was technically the North Jersey Non-Public Class B Finals. @!BOB-HURLEY : Have a good ball game. @!STEVE-KROFT-@1voic : But the game also happened to be for the national championship. It featured the number-one ranked St. Patrick of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael Gilchrist against one of the most storied programs in America. St. Anthony in Jersey City, and its legendary coach, Bob Hurley, ranked number two. @!BOB-HURLEY : Enjoy yourselves. Ready, everybody. Ready, one, two, three. @!CROWD-@1in-unison@ : Hard work. @!STEVE-KROFT-@1voic : Hard work was the mantra as St. Anthony broke the huddle, something they had been doing all year in preparation for this game. @!BOB-HURLEY : Were going to tight handle. @!STEVE-KROFT-@1voic : Their practices under Coach Hurley are famous for being among the most intense, grueling workouts in the country, at any level of the game. A basketball boot camp unsuited for the uncommitted or the politically correct. @!BOB-HURLEY : Go Josh, get him, get him. Get candy ass out. Sit down softie. Sit down softie. @!STEVE-KROFT-@1voic : Its the only coaching job Bob Hurley has ever had, and lots of things have changed in the thirty-nine years that he s been here. But he is not one of them. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!BOB-HURLEY : For sure. In this day and age, Im still one of the most demanding people that the kids are going to come across. @!BOB-HURLEY : Catch it. Face the basket. Make a play. You just got to get up closer, you do nt just say screen, my God, where next? @!STEVE-KROFT-@1voic : But this is not a story about a tyrannical coach who churns out athletes at some high school sports factory, its about values, loyalty, and commitment at a small inner city parochial school that does nt meet anyones idea of what a basketball powerhouse should look like. @!BOB-HURLEY : Step slide. @!STEVE-KROFT-@1voic : St. Anthony is in an old brick building with no gym, in a rundown neighborhood not far from the Jersey side of the Hudson River facing New York. There are only two hundred and forty students, most of them from families living below the poverty level, who somehow manage to scrape together the five thousand dollars tuition. And Sister Felicia, who runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high as Coach Hurleys. @!SISTER-FELICIA : For the past seventeen years, one hundred percent of all of our seniors have been accepted into college. And were proud of that. @!STEVE-KROFT : Thats -- thats pretty remarkable record. @!SISTER-FELICIA : Yes, it is. @!STEVE-KROFT-@1voic : But all of this has been under threat for some time now. St. Anthony, like many parochial schools, is deeply in debt, and constantly struggling to keep its doors open. It has managed to succeed, so far, for one reason -- @!SISTER-FELICIA : I think every school has their own particular talent and ours obviously is basketball. @!STEVE-KROFT-@1voic : And in some ways St. Anthony is the Julliard of high school basketball, a place where the gifted and the promising enroll to learn the finer points of positioning, technique, ball movement, and endurance. They are not there to have fun ; theyre there to get better and to learn how to win from one of the masters. This is your program. Theres no mistake about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- my fingerprint is on everything that we do. Ive had five NBA first round picks. Ive had about a hundred and fifty kids play Division 1 basketball. I think everybody can be better than they think they can be. And I do nt let them dictate, I dictate everything. @!STEVE-KROFT : Mm-Hm. Youre very tough and very demanding on these kids. @!BOB-HURLEY : But Im dealing with adolescent males. And in order to get them to perform on a regular basis, this group of -- group of people, I have to drive them. Theres no question I have to drive them. We would never be as good. Even the -- even the best teams Ive had, there has to be times when you know you have to really push the pedal. Youve never given a days effort in your life. Have you ever had a job? @!STEVE-KROFT-@1voic : Hurley is something of an expert on adolescent males -- for twenty-eight years, his day job was working as a probation officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their temptations as well as anyone, and he makes sure his kids stay on the straight and narrow. You make the kids sign a contract -- @!BOB-HURLEY : Yes. @!STEVE-KROFT : -- when they come here? @!BOB-HURLEY : Do nt know that its legally binding, but in -- in, you know, when I have to mete out justice, its as far as Im concerned, its a legal document. Yeah, its up to nineteen, it was up to nineteen things now. @!STEVE-KROFT : What are some of them? @!BOB-HURLEY : Alcohol, cigarettes, narcotics is one ; some of them are haircuts, short haircut. No tattoos. Jewelry has to be basic. You know, a ring, a -- a watch. @!STEVE-KROFT : You have drug test? @!BOB-HURLEY : Ive -- Ive drug tested entire teams. @!STEVE-KROFT : Do you have rebels? I mean, do you have people rebel against this? @!BOB-HURLEY : Oh, yeah. Yeah, thats why I think thats why there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- this is not meant for everybody. @!STEVE-KROFT-@1voic : Its meant for bright, talented kids who are committed to earning a college basketball scholarship and competing at the next level. @!BOB-HURLEY : Move your feet. Move your feet. @!STEVE-KROFT-@1voic : Everyone has to try out for the team, and Hurley does nt do any recruiting. Players or their parents seek him out because of his remarkable record. All of you come here because of Coach Hurley? @!LUCIUS-JONES : Yes. @!MILES-MACK : Yes, sir. @!STEVE-KROFT : All of you? @!CROWD-@1in-unison@ : Yes. @!STEVE-KROFT-@1voic : Over the years they have come from far and wide to attend St. Anthony. This years longest commute belongs to Jimmy Hall, who wakes up every morning at 6 AM in Brooklyn and travels by subway, bus and train across New York City and the Hudson to Jersey City, a commute that can take an hour and a half each way. His mother Noreen Wiggins, who raised her son in a single-parent home, thought St. Anthony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Jimmy to grow up. And Coach Hurley is just a part of the piece thats helping him to mature into a young man. @!STEVE-KROFT : Is this the most demanding situation he s ever been in? @!NOREEN-WIGGINS : Yes, by all means. It is. It took a little while for him to realize that, no, Coach Hurley is not trying to kill you Jimmy. He is really trying to make you the best player you can be. @!STEVE-KROFT : Is it worth it? @!JIMMY-WIGGINS : Yeah, its worth it. Very much so. @!STEVE-KROFT-@1voic : Senior guards Miles Mack, Lucius Jones, and junior forward Kyle Anderson, all knew exactly what to expect from Coach Hurley. @!KYLE-ANDERSON : He admitted to me today that he loses it every now and then. He pretty much puts the fear in your heart, you know, do nt mess up. But one thing that makes me pretty happy is when we see Mrs. Hurley come in. You know, thats when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming to an end. Shes coming to save us. @!STEVE-KROFT-@1voic : Hurleys wife, Chris, has been St. Anthonys official score keeper for the past twenty-five years, and knows a lot more about basketball than the average fan. @!BOB-HURLEY : Jordan.( INDISTINCT) Keep the first run. @!STEVE-KROFT-@1voic : Together, the couple raised two of St. Anthonys greatest players -- Bobby Hurley Jr., who went on to lead Duke to two national championships, and his younger brother, Danny, who starred at Seton Hall, and is now the head coach at Wagner College, where Bobby is his chief assistant. Did you feel he was harder on you than some of your teammates? @!BOBBY-HURLEY-JR. : Yes, and I think almost everyone on my team would say that my dad went out of his way to -- to be harder on me just to kind of send the message that there was no favoritism on the team. So it -- it -- it would de -- it was real, Dad, you got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I received I -- I think it strengthened the relationships I had with the other players. @!STEVE-KROFT : They felt sorry for you? @!DANNY-HURLEY : I do nt know. I think they felt sorry for themselves some days, too. @!BOBBY-HURLEY-JR. : Yeah, they werent alone. @!DANNY-HURLEY : Yeah, I mean, we were all in it together. @!STEVE-KROFT : Of all your accomplishments, what are you proudest of? @!BOB-HURLEY : Ive only had two kids in thirty-nine years that have not gone to college. And were extremely proud of that because we think that weve opened up doors in kids lives that they did nt know that they could do. Their families certainly did nt know that they could do it. And its as with -- because of education, it changes the direction of their life. @!STEVE-KROFT-@1voic : There were twenty-three of them playing college basketball this season -- five of them in the NCAA tournament for Pittsburgh- - @!MAN-# 1 : Travon Woodall gets an easy one. @!STEVE-KROFT-@1voic : Richmond, Villanova @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coach Hurley would have been proud of that one out at St. Anthonys. @!STEVE-KROFT-@1voic : He could have left St. Anthony for the big time long ago. There have been any number of opportunities to coach at the college level. But he s never been that interested in money or glamour, and each time decided to stay put in Jersey City. @!BOB-HURLEY : Some people may say I just wasnt very ambitious. But, you know, I think my wife and I found that over the years you just found so many kids that were here that when they come into school, you saw something in them, this potential. And you wanted to see it out. And then four years would go by. And then theres another kid in there someplace, freshman sophomore. And then eight years have gone by. And all of a sudden its about twenty years in. And then people started talking to me about, you know, coaching at the college level. @!STEVE-KROFT : Do you regret that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : No, absolutely not. But I do nt think I have a really -- I do nt -- I do nt think Im built for that. I think Im where Im supposed to be. I think Im good with this age and -- and Im good with city kids because, you know, I was a city kid. @!STEVE-KROFT : There are a lot of inducements for people to move on. Theres money. Theres the challenge of proving yourself at the next level. You werent interested in either of those things? @!BOB-HURLEY : No. I -- I always felt it, you know, the challenge here was pretty strong. @!STEVE-KROFT-@1voic : Like the small school with no gym and no money and trying to raise the bar each year to maintain the level of success. St. Anthonys financial shortfall is 1.2 million dollars each year and Hurley is the engine that propels the fundraising effort. @!BOB-HURLEY : If you want to make a contribution this evening. @!MAN-# 3 : Okay. Thank you. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hits the speaking circuit -- @!BOB-HURLEY : Salary does nt change a great deal in this particular school. @!STEVE-KROFT-@1voic : -- runs all year basketball clinics with all the proceeds going to the school. @!BOB-HURLEY : One, two, three. @!CROWD-@1in-unison@ : One, two, three, hard work. @!BOB-HURLEY : Good job. All right. @!SISTER-FELICIA : He s indispensible. And in addition to helping us financially, he s a role model for the kids and a father figure. Because they know that he has stayed in the city. He has nt left them. Money was not something that attracted him. He was here to help them and kids appreciate that, families appreciate that. @!STEVE-KROFT : Would this school be here right now if it wasnt for Bob Hurley? @!SISTER-FELICIA : Probably not. @!STEVE-KROFT-@1voic : Sister Felicia and the entire school were at Rutgers for the national championship game a few weeks ago, and it did not begin well for St. Anthony. @!BOB-HURLEY : Who got this? Relax guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roasted them in the first half. @!BOB-HURLEY : Stay in the game.( INDISTINCT) be strong with the ball. Its a long game, take control here. Keep the pressure on. @!STEVE-KROFT-@1voic : But after trailing most of the game, St. Anthonys superior conditioning, poise and coaching, finally turned the tide. @!BOB-HURLEY : Easy -- @!STEVE-KROFT-@1voic : They outscored St. Patrick 23 to 5 in the final quarter and won in a row. They closed out the season with their twenty- fourth state championship and fourth national title. It was the perfect ending for the season, and for our story. The players dreams had been realized, and the lessons well learned. @!BOB-HURLEY : Every eight seconds sprint we ran during the season, everything weve done, everyday Ive busted your chops, every study hall, does it all seem worth it right now? Valuable lesson learned here. @!STEVE-KROFT-@1voic : As for Coach Hurley, he s not going anywhere, he s already plotting another championship season. @!BOB-HURLEY : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Felica expects him to be around for another fifteen years. @!BOB-HURLEY : Are you going to shoot the ball in the basket? @!STEVE-KROFT-@1voic : -- so he can his twenty-month-old grandson, Gabe. @!BOB-HURLEY : Ready? Shoot. @!STEVE-KROFT-@1voic : In fact, its already begun. @!BOB-HURLEY : Yes. @!MORLEY-SAFER : Now, Andy Rooney. @!ANDY-ROONEY : They are always doing studies, and therere a lot of studies, whatever a study is, that suggest that drinking some things that used to be thought to be bad for us are now considered good and drinks which were thought to be good are now considered bad. Its got so you do nt dare drink diet soda because researchers say that that can be damaging to your health. Well, I do nt pay much attention to any of these alarms because for that matter life can be dangerous to your health, particularly in large amounts. Another study I saw says that sweet drinks increase your blood pressure and your chances of getting fat. Well, Im @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Coke once in a while? Thirty years ago they were saying that people who drank a lot of coffee were more apt to increase their chances of getting cancer. Now, a study from Israel says that drinking three cups of coffee a day is good for you and good for your circulation and may even protect you against heart attacks. Ive never paid attention to any of the research and Im still alive and drinking a lot of coffee. I was in Israel once and that did nt kill me either. Experts have determined that an occasional glass of red wine may be good for us so you may catch me with a glass at dinner. My attitude is " drink up " because tomorrow they might say its bad. What Im really waiting for is a study that says a lot of ice cream lowers your cholesterol. I mean, Ill eat to that. @!MORLEY-SAFER : Im Morley Safer. Well be back next week with another edition of 60 MINUTES.
