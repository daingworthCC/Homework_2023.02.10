The three main suspects were rearrested Wednesday night. @GRAPHICS @GRAPHICS @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1ABC-# @(Off-camera) And today, two of the suspects will be in court. And we 'll learn what prosecutors say is the new incriminating evidence against them. Gigi Stone is in Aruba with the very latest. Good morning, Gigi. @!GIGI-STONE-@1ABC-N# @(Off-camera) Good morning, Chris. A hearing at this Aruba courthouse today may reveal the answers everyone has been waiting for. What is this new evidence that led authorities to re-arrest the three main suspects in the Natalee Holloway disappearance after all this time? @!GIGI-STONE-@1ABC-N# @(Voiceover) Two brothers are set to appear before an Aruban judge today, Satish and Deepak Kalpoe. They 'll be the first to hear the, quote, ' new incriminating evidence, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joran van der Sloot, also arrested Wednesday, will be flown to this island in a matter of days. @!LEO-VAN-DER-EADEN-# Well, I think it 's, it 's, you know, almost a disaster - for a young kid, which has overcome so much, trying to get a new grip on his life, and then( inaudible) by lightning, getting back again. @!GIGI-STONE-@1ABC-N# @(Voiceover) Van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers were the last three people to see Natalee Holloway before her disappearance. @!DAVE-HOLLOWAY-@1NA# Yeah, it just gives us hope that they 're still involved and maybe we 'll finally get some answers. @!GIGI-STONE-@1ABC-N# @(Voiceover) Following their arrests, Holloway 's father, Dave, committed to launching a new search for his daughter 's body in the waters off Aruba, using divers and sonar equipment to map the ocean floor beyond the depths previously searched. @!BETH-TWITTY-@1NATA# It always goes back to the three primary suspects that Natalee was last seen with. So it - roads always lead back to them. @!GIGI-STONE-@1ABC-N# @(Voiceover) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was worried about the investigation. @!BETH-TWITTY-@1NATA# I think that it 's certainly not in the forefront anymore. @!GIGI-STONE-@1ABC-N# @(Voiceover) In fact, ABC News has learned police questioned the Van der Sloot family as recently as last week and authorities in Aruba searched their home this past April. @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1ABC-# @(Off-camera) Did you kill Natalee Holloway? @!JORAN-VAN-DER-SLOO# No. @!GIGI-STONE-@1ABC-N# @(Voiceover) Van der Sloot told Chris Cuomo, he had nothing to do with Natalee Holloway 's disappearance. @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1ABC-# @(Off-camera) Did you help someone else who harmed Natalee Holloway? @!JORAN-VAN-DER-SLOO# No. @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1ABC-# @(Off-camera) Did you see Natalee Holloway in distress? @!JORAN-VAN-DER-SLOO# No. @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1ABC-# @(Off-camera) Are you sure about all those answers? @!JORAN-VAN-DER-SLOO# Yes. @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1ABC-# @(Off-camera) Do you know how much those answers mean to her family, to a lot of other people? @!JORAN-VAN-DER-SLOO# A lot. @!GIGI-STONE-@1ABC-N# @(Off-camera) The evidence presented at this hearing today will have to be compelling because time is running short for prosecutors. They have until the end of this year to make their case against Van der Sloot and the Kalpoes. If they ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case. Chris? @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1ABC-# @(Off-camera) All right. Gigi, thank you for that. The man making the case against these three suspects is Aruba 's Chief Public Prosecutor Hans Mos. Here 's what he has to say about the situation. @GRAPHICS @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1ABC-# @(Voiceover) Good morning to you, Mr. Mos. Thank you for joining us. @!HANS-MOS-@1CHIEF-P# Good morning. @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1ABC-# @(Voiceover) So let 's get right to it. How confident are you in the grounds for these most recent arrests? @!ON-THE-PHONE-# @!HANS-MOS-@1CHIEF-P# Well, we are pretty confident about the arrests. And - the reasons why we arrested these three guys, we have new evidence, which we think is, is important in this case, and, and we see it as a necessary step up to the end of the year, where we have to take a final decision in this case. @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1ABC-# @(Voiceover) What can you tell us about the new incriminating evidence? @!HANS-MOS-@1CHIEF-P# Well, to be frank, nothing. In - the interest of the - of the investigation, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new evidence, because these guys have to be questioned. They are in all restrictions right now. They are not allowed to communicate with anyone else but their lawyers. Their lawyers are not allowed to communicate about the content of the new evidence. So I will not do that in the interest of the - of the investigation. @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1ABC-# @(Off-camera) When does Van der Sloot appear? When does he come down to Aruba? @!HANS-MOS-@1CHIEF-P# We expect him sometime today. @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1ABC-# @(Off-camera) And does the new evidence pertain to all three suspects equally or is it weighted towards Van der Sloot more, the Kalpoe brothers more? @!HANS-MOS-@1CHIEF-P# It - concerns from the three of them because in - how we see the case is that - they operated together in this. And the - the evidence and the information we have is that - this has been a case where they have - worked together, and, and we are trying to find out what their roles have been in this. And we have reasons to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way or another involved. And how we come to that conclusion, I can not disclose that at this time, but it pertains to all three of them. @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1ABC-# @(Voiceover) Let me end with this, Mr. Mos. Obviously, your job is to only bring cases that you believe strongly in. But at this point, do you believe you have the evidence you would need to convict these suspects of the crimes at hand? @!HANS-MOS-@1CHIEF-P# Well, I 'm convinced that if we have this proved by the time they were released somewhere in 2005, they would not have been released from jail. @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1ABC-# @(Voiceover) All right, Mr. Mos, I appreciate it. I understand why you ca n't be specific. But we 'll find out when they go before the magistrate. Thank you for joining us this morning. @!HANS-MOS-@1CHIEF-P# You 're welcome, sir. @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1ABC-# @(Off-camera) And it 's interesting for those who believe this is about the case coming to a deadline of December 31st. Never heard the prosecutors say, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have been released in 2005. Elizabeth? '
