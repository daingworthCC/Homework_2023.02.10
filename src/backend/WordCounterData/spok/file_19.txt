222741 THE ARCHBISHOP @!MIKE-WALLACE : Two days ago, Robert Sanchez resigned as archbishop of New Mexico. That resignation was prompted by the story you 're about to see. Robert Sanchez had gone from local priest to local hero 19 years ago when he became America 's first Hispanic archbishop. But lately he 's been under attack, charged with being aware that his priests have been sexually abusing children and doing nothing to stop them. @(Footage-of-Wallace) @!WALLACE :( Voiceover) Marlene Debray-Nowak says she complained to the archbishop three times that her ten- and 12-year-old sons, Tom and Mark, were being fondled by Father Arthur Perrault. That was 17 years ago. Nonetheless, over the years, the archbishop promoted Father Perrault to head the largest parish in the state. But last fall, an avalanche of lawsuits hit the New Mexico courts, charging numerous priests there with child abuse. The lawsuits include allegations that Father Perrault abused at least six more children after Marlene Debray-Nowak had reported him to the archbishop. @!Ms-MARLENE-DEBRAY- : The tragedy of it is, sir, that we did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three times, this happened 25 or 30 times, sir, in my home, sometimes when were we -- my husband and I -- were in the house. @!WALLACE : Oh, it was n't just one or... @!Ms-DEBRAY-NOWAK : Oh, no, sir! But my son, Tom, did not tell me this until he was 29 years old and I thought I 'd fall out of my chair. They protected them, sir. They protected the priest because he was a priest. And when you ask why -- you ask these children, ' Why did you do this? ' -- even when they were adults -- ' Because he was a priest. Because the nuns taught us in catechism that we mus n't say anything bad about the priests. We 'd go to hell because he represented God. ' That 's what makes this crime so despicable. @!WALLACE : Do you hold the archbishop responsible for all of this? @!Ms-DEBRAY-NOWAK : A hundred percent. @!WALLACE : Why? @!Ms-DEBRAY-NOWAK : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( Voiceover) He is the honcho, the boss. And his job is to protect the children, among other things. @!WALLACE :( Voiceover) The church itself estimates that more than 100 children were abused by about 20 priests. Attorney Bruce Pasternak, who represents the victims, alleges several hundred children were probably molested. @!Mr-BRUCE-PASTERNAK : Parents have come to us and told us that they personally met with the archbishop and complained that their children had been sexually molested by priests. Letters in the files reflect that the archbishop was warned by other bishops, by psychologists, by people in the community -- in the Catholic community. @!WALLACE : Down the years? @!Mr-PASTERNAK : All down the years he continued to receive those warnings and did not stop the pedophilia, I 'm afraid. @!WALLACE : Why do you think there 's been apparently so much of this in the New Mexico archdiocese? @!Mr-PASTERNAK : New Mexico became a center for the accumulation of the world 's pedophile priests. @!WALLACE : What... @!Mr-PASTERNAK : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facility operated by a small order of priests, was started here in 1947. And over time, it became the place where pedophiles from all over the world were sent. @(Footage-of-Paracle) @!WALLACE :( Voiceover) Paraclete House tries to rehabilitate pedophile priests. Over the years, many of the priests who came here went to work in the archdiocese of New Mexico when their treatment ended. Are children still being abused by priests today in this area? @!Mr-PASTERNAK : As recently as four months ago, a priest in northern New Mexico was criminally arrested and indicted for having molested a child. We have no reason to believe that this conduct has stopped. @(Footage-of-Wallace) @!WALLACE :( Voiceover) Tim Martinez recently revealed that when he was just 14, Father Jason Sigler seduced him into having oral sex. @!Mr-TIM-MARTINEZ-@1 : It 's going to be hard for someone to understand this that 's non-Catholic, first. You know, that -- the esteem and the -- the pedestal that you put a priest on. I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that you just go along with. @(Photographs-of-Fat) @!WALLACE :( Voiceover) Tim says he had sex with Father Sigler for six years. During that time, Sigler was treated for pedophilia at Paraclete House, but he would get weekend passes and have sex with Tim. Witnesses say they told the archbishop about Sigler 's pedophilia, but the archbishop did n't stop the priest. Well, eventually he was released from Paraclete House. @!Mr-MARTINEZ : Yes. @!WALLACE : And then? @!Mr-MARTINEZ : At that time -- then he went to Saint Therese, which is a church here in Albuquerque. @!WALLACE : Yes. And his duties were? @!Mr-MARTINEZ : I could n't believe this. One of them was to be in charge of altar boys, to supervise them. @!WALLACE : Did you say in charge of altar boys? @!Mr-MARTINEZ : Yes. The way the church approached the whole situation of pedophilia was that all you have to do is pray about it and everything will be OK. @(Footage-of-Saint-T) @!WALLACE :( Voiceover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Saint Therese, many of whom, according to the lawsuits, were molested by Father Sigler. Other priests molested girls. Susan Sandoval says that she was 15 and working in a church office when the archbishop 's close friend, Father Robert Kirsch, forced himself on her and took her virginity. @!Ms-SUSAN-SANDOVAL- : A little girl, a baby. I look at the pictures now and, you know, a little girl! @!WALLACE : And then, the affair went on after that? @!Ms-SANDOVAL : Yes. @!WALLACE : For how long? @!Ms-SANDOVAL : Until I was over the age of 18. @!WALLACE : For three years. @!Ms-SANDOVAL : Yes. @!WALLACE : Do you have any doubt that the archbishop knew what was going on between you and Father Kirsch? @!Ms-SANDOVAL : No doubt in my mind whatsoever. @!WALLACE : Why? @!Ms-SANDOVAL : Well, Father Kirsch introduced me to the archbishop on several occasions. Father Kirsch had a situation where his prior sexual improprieties were reported to the diocesan office. @!WALLACE : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voiceover) And Susan says when she was 16, she told the youth director for the archdiocese that she was having sex with Father Kirsch. She says the youth director, who worked closely with the archbishop, was n't surprised, and indicated it was n't a problem. @!Ms-SANDOVAL : Apparently, the collar puts them above the law. If you did it, if I did it, if we molested children, it 's criminal is n't it? @!WALLACE : Father, I want to read you some things... Father ROBERT KIRSCH( Accused of Pedophile) : Hey... @!WALLACE :... that have been said about you. @(Footage-of-Wallace) @!WALLACE :( Voiceover) We found Kirsch on a 10-mile pilgrimage. At first another priest tried to keep us away from him. Father Kirsch, I want to read you what Susan Sandoval says about you. ' She was 15 years old in 1974 when she took a nap one day on a cot in the office and she woke up with Father Robert Kirsch 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true. @!WALLACE : ' Kirsch was her parish priest in a small New Mexico town... ' qwq @( Another-man-steps- Father KIRSCH : You guys are harassing me. @!WALLACE : '... in a small New Mexico town. She lost her virginity that day. ' Now why would she say that about you, Father Kirsch, if it were not so? Why would she say that about you Kra -- Father Kirsch? You say it 's not true? Father KIRSCH : Absolutely. @!WALLACE : Why do you think Susan Sandoval would say that? Father KIRSCH : Because Bruce Pasternak told her to say it. @!WALLACE : Because her attorney or the family 's attorney told her to say that. Father KIRSCH : Right. @!WALLACE : He made it up for her? Father KIRSCH : Correct. @(Footage-of-Wallace) @!WALLACE :( Voiceover) But Father Kirsch, in a court deposition, had already admitted that he did have intercourse with Susan Sandoval. Still, he said that did n't violate his vow of chastity because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion. A priest who has worked with the archbishop here in New Mexico for 18 years has told us he has confirmed that since the 1970s Sanchez has known about priests molesting children here. @(Footage-of-Sanchez) @!WALLACE :( Voiceover) But this priest told us that the archbishop 's top priority has been to preserve and protect the church 's image, not his parishioners ' children. And so, this priest said, the archbishop has simply refused to stop the pedophilia or even to warn parents about it. @(Footage-of-Wallace) @!WALLACE :( Voiceover) Finally, jolted by the lawsuits, the Catholic church sent Father Ron Wolf to New Mexico last September. Father Wolf says his job is to clean up the mess. I mean, should n't the archbishop have stopped the molesting of the children by priests years ago? He 's been archbishop here since 1974, no? Father RON WOLF( Sent By Catholic Church To Stop The Molesting) : That 's right. And -- but the point is, Mike, as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that well-known in terms of what was involved with it from a psychological standpoint. Number two, pedophiles were being treated... @!WALLACE : Hold it just a minute... Father WOLF :... treated by psychologists. @!WALLACE : The nature of pedophilia is that somebody, an adult, is preying upon a child for sexual... Father WOLF : Right. Let me put it to you this way : the nature and the treatment. @!WALLACE : Uh-huh. And yet over the years, the archbishop knew perfectly well that pedophilia was going on in his archdiocese, and never, never moved to do it -- to stop it... Father WOLF : See, Mike... @!WALLACE :... to -- to inveigh against it publicly, to -- to tell his priests to -- I -- I 'm -- I confess to you, I do n't understand why. Father WOLF : I do n't have all the answers as I sit here, Mike. I 'd be a liar if I did. @!WALLACE : Mm-hmm. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation of the archdiocese of New Mexico. Father WOLF : Mike, there 's no question about this. This I -- even my brother priests do n't like me to use the term, it 's the mark of Cain. It 's a mark, it 's a blemish on the priesthood. @!WALLACE : But it turns out there 's even more. It turns out that the archbishop, despite his vow of celibacy, has been sexually active himself. @(Footage-of-three-w) @!WALLACE :( Voiceover) Now three women are breaking a silence that has lasted almost half their lives to say that Archbishop Robert Sanchez took sexual advantage of them soon after he became archbishop. They say they 're coming forward now to stop the child abuse. We spoke first with Judy Maloof. @!Ms-JUDY-MALOOF-@1S : Part of the way that he seduced me was through using spiritual language and my -- my religiosity. At the time, I was a very devout Catholic. I think he exploited my spirituality by comparing me at times with powerful religious icons like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virginity. @!Ms-MALOOF : That was n't all he took. I mean, that -- one of the outcomes of my affair with him was within a few months after he terminated the relationship, I lost my faith. @(Footage-of-Wallace) @!WALLACE :( Voiceover) All three women say they were very religious, innocent and trusting. Judy was 19 when the relationship began. Cathy Mendoza and Patty Madrid were 18. The archbishop was 40. Soon after he met them, the archbishop took Cathy and Patty on a private camping trip. @!Ms-CATHY-MENDOZA-@ : The thing that really surprised me, Mike, was that he put his sleeping bag between us. And I thought... @!WALLACE : Did you say anything to him at the time? @!Ms-MENDOZA : I thought it was strange. I did n't say anything, but I thought, ' Well, here 's this very important person -- who I thought was next to God -- he must know what he 's doing. ' @!WALLACE : Mm-hmm. @!Ms-MENDOZA : During the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean? @!Ms-MENDOZA : He put his hand in my sleeping bag and -- and fondled my breasts. @!WALLACE : And suddenly you realized that the archbishop... @!Ms-MENDOZA : Yeah. I was very naive, very naive. And I had no idea what was going on, what to do, what to say. Should I say anything? @!WALLACE : What did you say? @!Ms-MENDOZA : Nothing. @!WALLACE : You just let him... @!Ms-MENDOZA : I was -- I was scared. I was really scared. @!WALLACE :... caress you. Were you aware of the fact this was going on? @!Ms-PATTY-MADRID-@1 : I was n't aware that was happening to Cathy. As for my part, the only thing I remember is that he did roll over and he did kiss me. @(Photograph-of-the-) @!WALLACE :( Voiceover) Cathy and Patty say though they did not have intercourse with the archbishop, over the years he would kiss and fondle and caress them. Once, when the archbishop was caressing you, he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was missing? ' @!Ms-MADRID : Mm-hmm. As I look back on the abuse, for me, I think it did take on an incestual -- whatever, because that 's how he presented himself to me, as a father figure. @!WALLACE : I 'm sure that you 've heard this, that the archbishop was reluctant to act because he had participated in sexual abuse himself. Father WOLF : I -- no question. And if that 's what they say, Mike, eyeball to eyeball with you, I tell them, put up or shut up. Come on in here. Just do n't go behind his back talking. If you 've got the proof, give it to me. @!WALLACE : Let me do that right this instant. Father WOLF : Great. @!WALLACE : You know the Maloof family? Father WOLF : I sure do. I know... @!WALLACE : A distinguished family, a wealthy family, pillars of the community. Father WOLF : No question about it. @!WALLACE : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maloof told us. Father WOLF : Good. @!Ms-MALOOF :( from videotape) I think he exploited my spirituality by comparing me at times with powerful religious icons like the Virgin of Guadalupe. @!WALLACE :( from videotape) And then he took your virginity. @!Ms-MALOOF :( from videotape) That was n't all he took. I mean, one of the outcomes of my affair with him was I lost my faith. @!WALLACE : Judy Maloof, daughter of that family, charging the archbishop took her virginity and took her faith. You asked that somebody put up or shut up. Father WOLF : Fair enough. Mike, in the papers, on television, I have said, ' Victims, come to talk to me. ' She never showed up. @!Ms-MALOOF : Well... qwq @( Footage-of-Maloof, @!WALLACE :( Voiceover) When Archbishop Sanchez heard that Judy Maloof and Cathy Mendoza and Patty Madrid had talked to us, he only admitted having had relationships with them. But Father Wolf went further, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday Father Wolf called the archbishop 's resignation an admission of guilt and acknowledged that he resigned because of these public allegations. Other women, too, told us they had sexual relationships with the archbishop. One woman even claims that she was raped by Robert Sanchez back in 1973 and that when she finally confronted him about it two years ago, the archbishop gave her $ 25,000 to pay for the therapy she needed after the alleged rape and to keep her quiet. A footnote : ' Bishops all across the country have either ignored or protected priests who abuse children, ' according to Jason Berry, author of the book, " Lead Us Not Into Temptation. " Berry says that for years, many bishops have been moving pedophile priests from parish to parish without warning parishioners.
