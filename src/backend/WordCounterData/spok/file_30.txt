224341 DAN @!RATHER, anchor : Let 's go to Ann Cole, one of the best known trial consultants in -- in the country, very quickly, because they are resuming in court. Ms. Cole, what 's the impact of Johnnie Cochran on the jury thus far would you judge? @!Ms-ANN-COLE-@1Tria : He used his time last night very, very well. It was a disadvantage that he had to wait till this morning but he turned into a real advantage. Judge LANCE ITO( Los Angeles Superior Court) : I have looked at the videotape. It does not appear apparent to me, but I only took about 30 seconds to look at it. We 'll look into it at noon, but I just thought I 'd let you -- do n't go away. Unidentified Man 1 :...( unintelligible) security sense of it, right? Judge ITO : No, what I 'm going to do is I 'm going to take hair spray so that it wo n't reflect, is what I 'm going to do. But rather than have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!RATHER : Now the question is reflection in that pane of glass behind which one of the officers of the court sits, and the suggestion is they spray that so you wo n't see that reflection. Judge ITO : All right, Deputy Magnera, let 's have the jurors, please. And, Mr. Cochran, I 'll allow you to -- if you want to slop over a couple minutes there, but close to 12, you know, conclude your thought and... Unidentified Man 2 : Would you pardon Mr. Cochran after this... @!RATHER : They 're discussing now when they 're going to take the next break, which be in about a half-hour. Judge ITO : If I had to guess, that was the introduction. Unidentified Man 3 : I 'm sorry, I guess I got -- we got -- it 'll be this afternoon. Judge ITO : You 're worried about witnesses? Unidentified Man 4 : We 're leaving at 3:30 today, you guys. Unidentified Man 5 : I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- I 'm sorry -- I -- I 'll... Judge ITO : All right. Here are the jurors. @!RATHER : Now we see that the special trial consultant, who was seated next to O.J. Simpson earlier in the morning, for this portion of the defense opening statement will not be seated next to O.J., or at least for the moment she is not. Johnnie Cochran so far has spent most of his time in the opening statement dealing with the issue of whether O.J. Simpson was of -- an enraged, jealous, former husband, and what we 'll call the domestic relations side of the case. Judge ITO : All right....( unintelligible) we 've been rejoined by all of our jurors. Counsel, ladies and gentlemen, be seated please. Thank you. All right. Mr. Cochran, do you wish to continue? @!Mr-COCHRAN : Yes, I do, Your Honor. If I could have just one second, I 'm trying to pick up the last thought. Judge ITO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although he did spend some time on the domestic violence issues, he started out by quickly pointing out that there were eyewitnesses who really put the -- the -- you know, the prosecution 's version to a test because Rosa Lopez actually saw that vehicle there all night and another witness saw four other men coming out of the back of the Bundy residence and perhaps they were the murderers. @!RATHER : So the witnesses say. @!Mr-LEFCOURT : So the witnesses say. @!Mr-COCHRAN : Thank you very much, Your Honor. Thanks very much. I wanted to try to pick up where we left off. To conclude those remarks about this friend, I think that speaks volumes about Mr. Simpson and his stability, his relationship with his ex-wife. I think the evidence will also show that in about May of 1992, Miss Nicole Brown Simpson came over to the Rockingham house and said she 'd found a boyfriend, somebody different than Keith -- or the incident was April 1992 -- and said -- and asked Mr. Simpson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that point that it was over, and he was back with Paula and went on with his life. As I said, until such time as in 1993, she decided she wanted to get back together at that point. Now to clear up, I want to always keep the faith with you about being as accurate as I can. The two incidents that they talked about -- on the one incident involving the man Joe Stellini. That was at Mezzaluna. The other incident was at a restaurant called Tryst. In both incidents, there was no problem, no fight. In fact, in the Tryst incident, I believe it was -- the Mezzaluna incident, Mr. Simpson went home with his wife that night, so that there was not any incident where they were stalking or fighting or anything like that. There was no obsessive behavior. I hope that we 'll put those in some kind of perspective. @!Mr-Darden-talked-i# And Mr. Darden talked about the 1993 911 tape that you 've heard so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that, in that situation, although you could hear Mr. Simpson 's voice -- and he was angry -- Mr. Simpson never laid a hand on his wife, never called her a name, and I think the important thing about a trial is that finally you 're going to get to hear all of this tape. And what you 're going to hear -- Mr. Darden did n't tell you this yesterday -- is that there was a discussion on this 911 tape, and he alluded to the fact that Mr. Simpson could n't get out of his mind what he 'd seen back on April 1992. Well, now, first of all, most of us might have a problem getting that picture out of our mind of seeing your wife making love with someone else, but at any rate, this was n't the reason for the argument. What had happened was, and the facts will be, that when they started trying to get back together again in ' 93, they had an agreement, that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the -- you know, you put them away, basically, which seemed to be a reasonable request. And there was dispute because when Miss Brown Simpson would ever see Paula Barbieri 's picture, she was very upset about that. And Mr. Simpson, on this date I believe, saw a picture of somebody that she had dated during the time they had been separated. And he said, ' Gee, what 's fair for me will be fair for you, ' and they got into this conversation that went over a period of time. At some point, it was just a verbal conversation, and it escalated and tempers flared. That sometimes happens with marriage -- married couples. It does n't make it right, but sometimes it happens. He came over to her house, and he did, in fact, kick a French door. The evidence will be the door was already broken, that he fixed it, but he never at any time struck his wife during this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some point she says, ' O.J., O.J., be quiet. What about the kids? ' And he says essentially, ' You were n't thinking about the kids and being quiet when you were on the couch with Keith. ' I think you 'll hear that on -- on the tapes so you put it in perspective and the -- the important point to make is that nobody was ever injured during this period of time. In fact, there is a tape recording and a transcript from some police officers who came out and talked with these parties. And in that tape, you 'll get a chance to hear what Miss Brown Simpson thought about that incident, and they also talked to O.J., who waited there for them. So he agreed to fix that door, and they went on with their lives, and they went on to continue during that period of time to get along. This was a time they were back together. You should note that Mr. Simpson, because of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done in his life, has been able to amass some assets. Not bad for a young man -- a spindly-leg youth from San Francisco, who suffered with rickets, who could hard -- had trouble walking, was cared for by his mother, who grew up to become the greatest running back in the history of the National Football League and so, because of that and his commercial endorsements and things, he 's able to have several homes. He has a home in New York, and the evidence will be that in August of each year, because of his commitments with NBC, he would go and live in New York, and so he would n't try to control Miss Nicole Brown Simpson. I mean, she would do what she wanted to while he was here. Even during ' 93, he was living in New York from like August to like January, maybe after the Super Bowl or whatever -- August to January. He 'd be back there in his New York house. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orange County. And one thing I forgot to tell you about the circle of benevolence. He assisted his wife in buying a condo in Laguna for herself, separate from his house. So when she was at Rockingham, she had two condos in her own name : one in Laguna, one in San Francisco she 's getting money from, and living in Rockingham. They did n't tell you about that. He also bought some property in Cabo San Lucas where he planned to build. All of the things that he was doing was about the family, about keeping the family together, doing things with in-laws and with friends and with the children. So I think you 'll hear evidence about the fact that he was away great periods of time. And while I 'm about that, let me tell you about the kind of schedule this man had. You wo n't be able to see his calendar yet, but at some point hopefully we will. If you went back and looked at Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1994, you 'd find a man that in January was out of town and probably still living in New York almost every day, but he was out of New York because he was traveling. Some of you who know this is Super Bowl week, you can imagine that he was in Atlanta that week, because that 's where the Super Bowl was last year. That the evidence will be that this was a time that he and his wife were trying to make it. That he took some family members, the Browns from Germany, to the Super Bowl in Atlanta. Paid for all of them, got them 50-yard seats, took them to all the big parties that are going on this week. He was again out of town during almost all of that particular month. If you looked at his calendar and you 're able -- with the testimony that in February he spent a lot of time in Cabo San Lucas. He was in Nashville, in Saint Louis, in Miami, in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you find he was even here in Los Angeles. If you looked at March, you 'd find that he was in New York, was doing Bryant Gumbel 's charitable golf tournament in Orlando, Florida, back in New York again. He was all over the country doing various and sundry things. You got to the month of April, back in Cabo. From there he came back to Los Angeles, then he went to Puerto Rico. And the evidence will be that he -- some of you know he 's an actor -- a would-be actor -- and that he made this movie " Frogmen " during that period of time in Puerto Rico. Again, very much out of California. And in May, with the exception of some things that he came to do for his children -- and, by the way, again, talking about the kind of things that he would do at Rockingham, and you 'll see this place at Rockingham. On May 22nd, he had a school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and I think that 's for the Sunshine Preschool. That is where his son Justin went. It was a fund-raiser for this school. They had all the kids and all these people would come to his house at Rockingham to raise money for the school. On May 22 he did that, and Nicole Brown Simpson was there, and even though they had agreed in May -- earlier that month in May -- and he was now back with Paula, when Nicole Brown Simpson got sick the week of May 15th, 1994 -- she had pneumonia -- O.J. Simpson was the one who took her soup and tried to nurse her back to get her back on her feet, even though they agreed they were n't going to be together anymore. You 'll hear testimony with regard to that. And he continued, of course, being in and out of town. In June of 1994, he 'd had and had taken his two children, Sidney and Justin -- and let me say something at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's equally proud of. The minors can not be here obviously for obvious reasons, but he has two other children he 's equally proud of and they 're here in court today. There 's Arnelle Simpson over there and Jason Simpson sitting between his two sisters, Carmelita Jewell and Miss Shirley Baker. And the balance of the family, and you 've met Miss Eunice Simpson already. So he, on May 5th, attended a pediatric AIDS affair -- again, his interest in children and AIDS and charitable work -- along with Paula, and he took the two younger children. It was a real fine day, and that was on that Sunday. On that Tuesday, he left to go to Washington, DC. Again he left town. He had to work. On Wednesday he was working for Hertz in Washington, DC. On Thursday, he was in Connecticut working again at one of his board meetings. He 's on these various boards -- some charitable, some profitable, hopefully. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, he was in New York with his friend Bender, and he 'd worked, and he tried to play golf during these periods of times. You recall I mentioned that Mr. Bender had suggested, ' You 're going to be in Chicago on Tuesday or Monday night, stay over. ' He came home for the recital. And when you see his calendar, you 'll see, it 's planned all the way out far beyond June, of course, of 1994. But it gives you a sense of this man, this man 's life, what he 'd been able to do with his life and with himself. I point out these things to you because I think, as you look at all of the incidents that Mr. Darden talked about, it puts them in perspective. This is not a case about domestic abuse. It 's a murder case. It 's a murder case about who did these horrible crimes. That 's going to be your decision ; not to think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, for that matter, but to get a picture of him. And I think that you 'll agree with me that after you hear the facts you 'll have a clearer picture. Now about the 19 -- we talked about the 1993 incident, I think we did. And I think that 's -- those are the min -- main incidents that Mr. Darden talked about. One thing I wanted to point out to you is that there will be, I believe, testimony as these parties got a divorce, as so often happens, Miss Nicole Brown Simpson had her deposition taken. And she made a statement in that deposition with regard to whether or not he ever physically struck her after the ' 89 incident. And it will be interesting to hear what that is. That this Mark Fuhrman becomes even relevant in this case as we go along and discuss it because he was the officer who had supposedly responded, he says, in ' 85. There 's evidence that the incident involving the bat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pregnant, but he writes a report four years later, in ' 89, saying he had an indelible impression of Mr. O.J. Simpson in coming to that location -- an indelible impression, so we 'll have to pursue what that means in this report that he wrote about that incident some four years later and whether or not it was accurate. It was not done contemporaneously with the incident. @!Mr-Darden-also-sai# Let me say this about Faye Resnick. @!Mr-WILLIAM-HODGMAN : Counsel, I 'm sorry to interrupt. Your Honor, once again, my objection has been previously noted. Judge ITO : I -- I 'd caution you, Mr. Cochran, about what you 're just about to launch into because there 's not -- that person 's not on the witness list. And when you say let me tell you about somebody, I -- I 'm concerned. @!Mr-COCHRAN : There 's a possibility that... @!Mr-HODGMAN : All right, I think we should hear these objections at the sidebar. However, is there... @!Mr-COCHRAN : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reporters, may we? Judge ITO : Please. @!RATHER : Now what this is about apparently is Faye Resnick, who wrote a book about this case. Johnnie Cochran introduced that subject into his opening statement. You saw the attorney for the People rise and say, in effect, ' Your Honor, I object to this because this person is not on the witness list. ' @!Mr-LEFCOURT : You know, there 's a -- there 's an old courtroom saying that you can open the door. And defense attorneys have a door that apparently is made of bamboo while the prosecution 's -- you know, the prosecution 's doors are made of steel, and if you just simply say something that opens up an issue, the prosecution may launch into it. And he may have, if she 's not on the witness list, opened the door to hearing some prosecution testimony that they perhaps did n't expect. Similarly, with this statement earlier that Dr. Walker examined O.J. Simpson and is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prosecution has -- you know, has had an opportunity to examine O.J. Simpson, and that may be another thing where we 're going to hear more about later. @!RATHER : Let 's ask Laurie Levenson about that. Laurie, what do you think, that the prosecution now be open to saying to the judge, ' Wait a minute, Johnnie Cochran said the defense had examined O.J. Simpson psychiatrically or psychologically on this subject, so we should be allowed to examine him '? @!Ms-LAURIE-LEVENSON : I certainly think that 's what the prosecution will ask for, and beyond that the prosecution will ask again to use their own battered women 's syndrome experts and have them testify as well. And also the defense might be opening the door on character witnesses so that the prosecution could produce their own witnesses that would go against O.J. 's character, even beyond those witnesses the judge has already allowed on domestic abuse. So the defense does have to be careful, and I do wonder whether they have opened some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's think from Johnnie Cochran 's point of view. Nobody ever accused him of just going to school to eat his lunch. Nobody ever ever accused him of being dumb. Now what we 've laid out here is the possibility that he 's opened up some things that could conceivably give the attorneys for the People some openings they did n't previously have. Why would he have done that? @!Mr-THEODORE-WELLS- : Well, they may be willing to subject O.J. to an interview by a prosecution expert in the hope they can get in front of the jury, that way, O.J. 's feelings. Judge ITO : All right, thank you, counsel. @!Mr-COCHRAN : Oh, excuse me, sir. Thank you, your Honor. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Excuse me. I talked just briefly about this witness, Faye Resnick, and you may or may not hear from her. She 's on our witness list. There 's a possibility. We may call her for a number of reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's only a possibility. Judge ITO : Counsel, overruled. @!Mr-COCHRAN : The reason why I think the ev -- the evidence will show, and it will be relevant to you, is that on or about June 3rd of 1994 Faye Resnick, who had had a long-time relationship with a Dr. Christian Reichardt, whom we will definitely be calling -- they had been living together for a long time. And because of her drug uses -- usage, because of the fact she was freebasing cocaine, he put her out, literally. They broke up. It was one of these parties who they -- they ran in this circle out there in Brentwood. And when she was put out on June 3rd, which I think was a Friday, she then moved over and lived with Nicole Brown Simpson because they were friends. They would go out at night. These were all friends. The evidence will be these ladies would go out two, three, four nights a week and stay out till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. There 's a group of them, and you 'll hear about it. They 'd go out dancing. They 'd do whatever they would do, and we know Faye Resnick was using drugs in this period of time. It got so bad, the evidence will be, that on June 8th, 1994, they had what we call an intervention, that Nicole and Christian Reichardt and her former husband Paul Resnick all got together to try and convince her that she had to go into a drug treatment facility called Exodus. And on the 8th of June... @!Mr-HODGMAN : Excuse me, counsel. I 'm sorry, once again. Your Honor, you had asked us or given us leave to address these issues in the noon hour. Judge ITO : Overruled. Please be seated. Please be seated. @!Mr-HODGMAN : Very well. Judge ITO : Thank you. @!Mr-COCHRAN : Goes into a drug treatment facility on June 8th, and she remains there and she 's there on June 12th. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the people who calls Miss Nicole Brown Simpson on the night of June 12th, perhaps after 9:00 that particular night, from this drug treatment facility. We 'll be talking about that and her role in this whole drama. To conclude then, what I 've tried to do in this opening statement is to lay out for you the fact that in almost everything you hear in this case there are two sides. That as jurors, I 'm sure you 're not going to rush to judgment, that this should not be a case about character assassination, and I hope you 'll keep an open mind until you hear all of the evidence as it relates to who Mr. Simpson is. Now shifting our attention now to the discussion -- a very able discussion of Miss Marcia Clark yesterday. It seemed to me, as you summarized what she had to say to you, that her argument broke down or -- well, it was argument at the end, but her opening statement broke down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Let me, first of all, talk to you about the concept of a time line. Let me talk a little bit about that, and let me tell you what she did n't tell you about, and some of this we 've covered so I wo n't be redundant, but there are witnesses like the lady who lived next door to Mr. Simpson. There 's a Mr. Tom Lange that she knows about and did n't tell you about, who on this particular night, June 12th, 1994, was walking his dog on the street called Dorothy Street, right down the way from Miss Nicole Brown Simpson 's condo at 875. That from his vantage point, just a short distance on the corner, he looked up, and he saw a lady that he believes wa -- was Miss Nicole Brown Simpson either embracing someone at a vehicle at the curb, and behind Miss Simpson he saw a man that he described as a Hispanic or Caucasian standing with his hands clenched, standing there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know why this man was looking like this. This is about 10:00 on June 12th, whether he was angry -- because Mr. Lange did n't know whether he was angry because his dog was loose or what, but, again, this is what I expect this testimony to be. This was at 10:00. And he sees a lady that he believes is Nicole Brown Simpson at that point. I talked to you briefly before about Ellen Aronson and Dan Mandel, whom she did n't talk to -- but she 's talked to them but she did n't talk about them yesterday. As they walked past this place, right at about 10:25 or thereabouts. And there 's another witness whose name is Robert Hydstra. Robert Hydstra is in an alley one street over. But when you go out there you will be able to see how well you can hear late at night -- especially on a Sunday night at this location. Mr. Hydstra, according to his statement, is walking in this alley and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks parallel to where the Bundy residence is, he would be then looking west. He hears a sound of like arguing and he hears someone -- a voice say, ' Hey, hey, hey. ' And he hears the sound of a fence closing and continues on walking his dog. Now this is 10:40 or thereabouts. And you know then at 10:45 Mary Anne Gerchas sees these four men running from 875 down toward her direction, and she believes they are coming after her at that point. In her statement to you yesterday, Miss Clark talked to you a lot about Allan Park, and I read you some of his transcripts on this testimony that you did n't hear about. And I think there will be considerably more with regards to Mr. Park and to Mr. Kato -- Kato Kaelin. Interesting man. I think that it will be interesting when you hear from Mr. Kato Kaelin about Mr. Simpson and how he appeared that night. Just before we wrap up for lunch, I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that O.J. Simpson committed these horrible murders, you 'd have to believe that he came back from back East, where he had been working, to come to his daughter 's recital. Attended that recital. You see his picture there. He was home getting ready for a trip. Chicago had long been preplanned. That he was hungry. The evidence will be that he did n't have any dollar bills or $ 20 bills, that he asked to borrow money from Kato Kaelin. And Kato Kaelin gave him this money. he went and had a Big Mac. You 'd have to believe that he was planning to kill his wife either before he got this Big Mac or then went and got the Big Mac. But Kato Kaelin will describe, he was dressed in some kind of sweat clothes and some tennis shoes. That to follow the People 's case, you 'd have to believe that he then came home and said, ' Gee, I think what I 'll do is I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I 'll take these tennis shoes off and put on some -- some dress shoes -- some hard-soled shoes and change clothes, ' knowing he 's going to be leaving shortly to go to the airport. And then you 'd have to do -- you 'd have to believe that to believe their theory. And th -- and to make that theory work, they spent all this time talking about the plaintive wail of a dog. But that 's -- they got to make this as early as possible at 10:15. We know that that 's not correct based upon the facts that you heard. And to conclude, is n't it interesting that in all the discussion yesterday by these two very excellent lawyers, they never once mentioned their coroner, Dr. Golden. He 's another mysterious -- mystery witness they do n't want to talk about. And when we come back this afternoon, let 's talk about why the prosecution does n't want you to know about Dr. Golden. Let 's talk about what Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix the time of death here with any precision. ' We will have testimony from one of the leading pathologists in the United States, Michael Baden, who 's also worked for the LA County district attorney 's office, whose written a book about the John Belushi death. He was able to pinpoint the time of death to within one hour. And yet in this case, because the coroner was not called for 10 hours after these bodies were found, or eight hours, and they got out there about 10 hours, following the state law, we are precluded from pinpointing this, and they have to tell you that it 's about a dog 's wail when a man 's life is at stake. We 'll pick up after lunch, Your Honor. Judge ITO : Thank you, Mr. Cochran. All right, ladies and gentlemen, we will stand in recess for the jury until 1:30. Let me speak to counsel after the jury has departed. All right, let 's clear the @ @ @
