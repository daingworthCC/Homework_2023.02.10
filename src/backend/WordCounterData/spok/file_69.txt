There 's -- the skin looks good. There 's no bruises on it. And we 're going to do the same criteria for beautiful yellow tomatoes. This is a beautiful yellow tomatoes, as well. And we 're going to move forward on these green tomatoes. But that 's going to be a little bit more firm than this red and yellow tomatoes. You can pick any kind of squash you like. I picked the acorn squash because I like it very much. And this one looks beautiful. The skin is nice and green. And there 's no crack on it and it 's nice and firm. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to pick out four different kind of apple today. We 're going to pick up one Empire apple. We 'll also have some Courtland apple. We also going to take a greenish apple, nice and green, and we 're going to pick a McIntosh apple. Here we have four beautiful apple.

And when we come back, I 'm going to show you how to make a beautiful French dinner. @(Announcements) @!MITCHELL : And we are joined by chef Cyril Renaud from La Caravelle restaurant. Hi, Chef. @!Mr-RENAUD : Thank you very much. @!MITCHELL : Thanks for coming in. @!Mr-RENAUD : A pleasure. @!MITCHELL : What are we having today? @!Mr-RENAUD : We have a tomato feuillette to start and... @!MITCHELL : Wh -- wh -- what 'd you call that, one more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Yes. And then we 're going to have risotto -- a farmer 's risotto. And we 're going to have roasted apple after that. @!MITCHELL : OK. @!Mr-RENAUD : All right? @!MITCHELL : Let 's get started. @!Mr-RENAUD : OK. We have here green tomatoes. And I 'm going to show you how to cut the green tomatoes. What I do here is I do always a little( unintelligible) on the side and then I do the slice right there. We 're going to do a few slice, just to show you right here. @!MITCHELL : Mm-hmm. @!Mr-RENAUD : And then when we have the slice, we put that in a plate right here. And we 're going to use salt and pepper and we 're going to season all this. You have to season your tomato about 10 to 20 minutes in advance so actually the water of the tomato will come up. @!MITCHELL : What are the different flavors I 'm going to get from these three s -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Well, this one is more -- there 's less acid in the yellow tomatoes. And also the red tomato, there 's more acid, of course, and the texture of the green tomato is sort of different in all of them, so... @!MITCHELL : Mm-hmm. @!Mr-RENAUD :... I think it 's great to have all this combination actually and -- right there. So we have the marinade. And here I have also some basil leaf. So what we 're going to do with the basil leaf is -- is I 'm going to show you how to chop it. It 's very important to not chop it too much, otherwise it turns black. @!MITCHELL : All right. @!Mr-RENAUD : So I turned the leaves together here. And we 're going to chop the basil like this right here. That we 're going to put on top of some of the tomato right here, too. @!MITCHELL : Now you marinaded this all at the same time. @!Mr-RENAUD : That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one tomato any more than another? @!Mr-RENAUD : No, you -- no, you do n't have to do that. @!MITCHELL : OK. @!Mr-RENAUD : You do n't have to do that. I think it 's fine. @!MITCHELL : All right. @!Mr-RENAUD : And it 's good to have the same texture also after that. So here I have some woodberries and sunflower sprout that are already mixed also with some basil. @!MITCHELL : Looks very healthy. @!Mr-RENAUD : And also the -- the remaining of the tomatoes that -- I chop it up inside of this. Then I season with some salt and pepper and -- and... @!MITCHELL : Using sea salt. @!Mr-RENAUD : That 's right. We 're using some sea salt. And I have already some olive oil inside here. And what I do -- so we 're going to finish the tomato feuillette. I take one of the slices of green tomato, and then we 're going to finish on top here. And then we put some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great. @!Mr-RENAUD : Yes. And then what i -- what is very good about it is that you have some juice all the time coming out from the tomatoes and you use that around. So I will use a little bit of olive oil to finish the dish today. And very simple, just like that. @!MITCHELL : Ah. @!Mr-RENAUD : And then we top it with a little basil. Here we have the first course right here. @!MITCHELL : Very nice. @!Mr-RENAUD : Yes. @!MITCHELL : OK. Let 's move on. Entree time. @!Mr-RENAUD : OK. Yes, we 're going to start with the risotto. So here I have some onions and some scallion that already been stewing for about two minutes right now. So here I 'm adding the -- the rice. And we 're going to be stewing that for another -- about two, three minutes, I would say. @!MITCHELL : That 's all? Two or three minutes. @!Mr-RENAUD : Yes. That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course. After that time, you add the white wine. So you add the white wine and you gon na wait... @!MITCHELL : That 's about a cup? Right? @!Mr-RENAUD : It 's about a -- yes, ha -- yes, half a cup for... @!MITCHELL : OK. @!Mr-RENAUD : Half a cup. Then you gon na wait until the white wine disappear. So to that time, you 're going to add the chicken stock. It 's about four cup in there. So what I do is I add about two cup, half of it. And we 're going to start cooking it. @!MITCHELL : And this chicken stock has been on the stove for a while. It 's pretty hot. @!Mr-RENAUD : Oh, just -- yeah, it 's very hot. @!MITCHELL : Right. @!Mr-RENAUD : So it 's very good to have the chicken stock hot... @!MITCHELL : Right. @!Mr-RENAUD :... so you do n't stop the cooking time of the risotto. And after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risotto here. @!MITCHELL : Ah. @!Mr-RENAUD : You have -- the risotto is almost cooked. It 's still a little al dente. And I add a little bit of chicken stock.

And I 'm going to add the corn into the risotto. And the corn is -- yes... @!MITCHELL : I was going to ask if you cooked this corn before? @!Mr-RENAUD : No, I keep it raw. That 's what I was going to say. @!MITCHELL : All right. @!Mr-RENAUD : Because I think, for the flavors, it gets -- it keeps its sweetness, you know? And if you keep -- cook it in the water, it will lose some of its sweetness... @!MITCHELL : All right. @!Mr-RENAUD :... especially right now, it 's so good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squashes. And this is acorn squash that I have here. And I 'm going to show you -- we gon na be cutting the -- I cut the edge of it so we have a good balance. I 'm going to be taking off the skin right there.

And I 'm going to take out the seed, right there. Right there we 're taking out the seed. And one went in the plate. It 's kind of a -- and then we 're going to be slicing -- slicing them right there. @!MITCHELL : All right. @!Mr-RENAUD : And then... @!MITCHELL : What are we gon na do? This going to go into the risotto as well, all of this? @!Mr-RENAUD : That 's going to be going on top of the risotto. @!MITCHELL : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. You can sli -- cut, you know, any way you want it. I mean, it does n't matter. It does n't have to be... @!MITCHELL : And you 're going to put this with mushrooms? @!Mr-RENAUD : That 's right. @!MITCHELL : All right. @!Mr-RENAUD : Here I have mushrooms already sliced and some( unintelligible) sliced that we 're doing here.
