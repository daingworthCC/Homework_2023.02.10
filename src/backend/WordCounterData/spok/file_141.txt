247741 LIANE HANSEN, Host : The State Department can refuse to answer questions in at least 100 ways. 1ST DIPLOMAT : from tape I 'm not going to discuss the options that we have before us. This is a confidential process until we reach the conclusion of that process. 2ND DIPLOMAT : from tape It 's absolutely impossible for us to know what the North Korean motives are. 3RD DIPLOMAT : from tape We 'd prefer not to comment on the elections in Hungary until the conclusion of the second round @!HANSEN It 's easy to wonder why diplomats talk to the press and why reporters bother to listen. Our diplomatic correspondent, Ted Clark, tells us why he bothers and what he listens for. 4TH DIPLOMAT : from tape -on what 's going, on what may or not have been said in Vienna. 5TH DIPLOMAT : from tape I do n't have anything on the meeting of Bob Gallucci- TED CLARK, Reporter : It 's easy to lose patience with this evasiveness. It often seems the State Department is trying to duck responsibility, avoid criticism, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diplomats also have some legitimate reasons for being careful when they speak. State Department officials deal in national security matters. They want to keep their options open. They do n't want to reveal strategies before they 're sprung. And, if State Department officials start answering questions, they can easily get cornered and end up saying what they had n't wanted to say. WINSTON LORD, Assistant Secretary of State : from tape OK. 1ST REPORTER : from tape Question? Mr. LORD : Well, you had one already, and she had her- Did you have one? 2ND REPORTER : from tape Yeah, I- This is just- Mr. LORD : Well, that's- OK. Here 's where you get in trouble. 2ND REPORTER : Are you going to meet with Hwang Jun Tao sp when he 's in town this week? Mr. LORD : I do n't hand out my personal schedule, but I- The answer 's ' yes. ' I mean, why fool around? sound of general laughter 2ND REPORTER : And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well, it 'll be a quiet meeting although it just became less quiet, I guess @!CLARK And that 's how Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord sp, announced one of his private meetings earlier this year. There 's another reason diplomats are careful about what they say. In foreign affairs, certain words and phrases take on symbolic importance, implying far more than they would in everyday conversation. This is especially true in the Middle East, where Arab and Israeli leaders have spent decades attaching precise meanings to key phrases, and where analysts scrutinize every U.S. statement for the slightest change in phraseology. It 's a minefield even a State Department spokesman like Mike McCurry would rather avoid. 3RD REPORTER : from tape Is it the United States position that the settlements are an obstacle to peace, illegal, not legal - what is it? MIKE MCCURRY, State Department Spokesperson : from tape We 've said in the past that they are obstacles to peace. 3RD REPORTER : So they 're not illegal and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, do we go back to the Rogers Principle? Mr. MCCURRY : Why are- I know I 'm going to hate this conversation. Why are we going to do it? Now, do we really want to do this? CLARK : With so much baggage attached to language, diplomats have learned to rely on safe, well-worn phrases, a diplomatic code that describes events in the gentlest, most indirect manner possible. It 's easy to learn the basic code. A ' frank ' or ' candid ' discussion is one in which the two sides disagreed. If the participants shouted at each other, the meeting might be described as ' lively. ' If the parties moved toward common ground, the talks were ' constructive. ' Now, you know what went on last month when President Clinton and Prime Minister Rao of India held their talks. 6TH DIPLOMAT : from tape They were constructive, useful and candid @!CLARK Diplomats generally avoid blunt language, but there is one code word that has ominous implications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks by President Bush. The year is 1989, and he 's talking about Manuel Noriega, then the dictator of Panama. Frmr. Pres. GEORGE BUSH : from tape And Mr. Noriega single-handedly sent out his dignity battalions to beat up the elected vice president and to keep the will of the people from being fulfilled, and that is unacceptable as we see the world, particularly in these times, when we see the world moving more and more towards democratic change @!CLARK The key word is ' unacceptable. ' In diplomatic jargon, that 's a fighting word when used deliberately. It means the U.S. will take action, and, four days after Mr. Bush used the word, U.S. forces invaded Panama to capture Manuel Noriega. Officials generally do n't like to admit changes in policy. A change implies the earlier policy was a failure. So you often have to listen carefully to diplomatic language for hints that policy is changing. An example - on March 16th, President Clinton was asked whether he planned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights. He began by saying there was no change. Pres. BILL CLINTON : from tape Our policy is what it has been - that human rights are important, but the other issues are important, too @!CLARK To understand what the president was really saying that day, you had to know what he had said previously, which was that human rights were more important than U.S.-China trade. ' Whether I extend trade privileges will depend upon whether China makes significant progress in improving its human rights record. ' With that statement in mind, you could hear the change in emphasis in the president 's March 16th statement. Let 's play that tape again. Pres. CLINTON : from tape -human rights are important, but the other issues are important, too @!CLARK Human rights have become just one of several important issues in the U.S.-China relationship, not the most important. The president had delinked sic human rights from trade. Diplomatic language is so oblique, so cautious, so nuanced that it 's given rise to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the midday briefing. 7TH DIPLOMAT : from tape The president could n't have been clearer on that subject Sunday. Thank you @!CLARK After the ' thank-you 's ' are said, the lights, cameras and microphones are turned off, and reporters gather around the spokesperson for a few more questions - this time not on the record. Cloaked in anonymity, the briefer can speak like a normal human being again and can give more information and more insight. These background exchanges are often the most useful conversations reporters have at the State Department. And I 'll admit they can feel like a breath of fresh air after the normal on-the-record fair. This is Ted Clark in Washington. music 8th DIPLOMAT : from tape I 'm not in a position to review the prior history with you and all- I 've really said all I can say on it. No, we are not going to be characterizing the exchange itself. I do n't have anything in detail on what our position is on what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a position to evaluate that for you. No I have n't. Because he 's meeting all day at the White House today, I think I would- HANSEN : It 's 18 minutes past the hour. music HANSEN : In his history of African-American humor, Mel Watkins writes about objects known as ' laughing barrels. ' MEL WATKINS, Author : There were such things in Southern towns after emancipation. Blacks were required in some towns to, when they got the urge to laugh, to put their heads into a barrel and to laugh because whites felt that blacks laughing was something that should be hidden. For one thing, it was because they did n't know what they were laughing at. But they certainly did n't want the loud, cackling laughter to be heard in these towns. The laughing barrel 's a real story. It reflects the ways blacks and whites related in some Southern towns @!HANSEN Coming up on Weekend Edition, more history, more humor from On the Real Side.
