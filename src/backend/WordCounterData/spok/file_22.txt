Now that we told you how to spruce up the deck, we re going to tell you how to plant a beautiful garden around the deck and just make it more enjoyable to be out there.

But there is now in production, or now in design, a car that one company s trying to make the safest possible audio. What could you -- auto. JOAN LUNDEN : It s a little -- it s really interesting. CHARLES GIBSON : What could you do if you really set out to make a car as safe as you could? And Jean is going to show us what the Toyota people have been able to come up with there. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big in syndicated television now. She is played by a young actress named Lucy Lawless, and she s going to be with us in a few moments. But let s get to the morning news, and Elizabeth Vargas. ELIZABETH VARGAS, ABC News : Thank you so much, Charlie and Joan. Good morning again, everybody. An extensive new study provides the strongest evidence yet that exercise helps lower the risk of breast cancer in women. The study indicates just four hours of exercise a week can reduce the risk dramatically. Researchers say physical activity brings down levels of certain hormones in the body. Dr. LISA SHAMES, University of Southern California : These lower levels of estrogen and progesterone will essentially or presumably reduce our risk of breast cancer in the future. ELIZABETH VARGAS : Higher than normal levels of those hormones are believed to raise the risk of breast cancer. The doctors and relatives of Alzheimer s patients are being urged to get those patients to hand over the car keys. The American Psychiatric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mid-robbing disease can cause car crashes. A 1995 government study finds 50 percent of girls between 15 and 19 years old have had sex at least once. But the study also shows a drop in sexual activity of 5 percent since 1990. That s the first decrease since the survey s inception in 1970, when 29 percent of teens reporting having sex. Foster children will have an easier time finding permanent new homes if the bill passed overwhelmingly by the House yesterday becomes law. States would no longer be required to try to unite children with abusive parents. And finally, from England, a man who gives new meaning to the phrase Holy Roller. We get his story now from ABC s Nathan Thomas. NATHAN THOMAS, ABC News :( voice-over) Tradition runs deep in the Church of England, but Vicar David Streeter is testing the limits, trying to reach the young people in his parish. He runs a disco, delivers Vicarograms, and tops his vestments with a baseball cap. Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local teenagers wanted a lift to a skating rink. The vicar got bored watching and was soon sporting $125 worth of wheels. DAVID STREETER, Vicar : I m doing it because it s good fun and good exercise, but it also gives me a street " cred " with the boys and girls and enables me to meet them on their own level and to show that if I can do what they do, then they can come and do what I do in church. NATHAN THOMAS :( voice-over) He s still shaky on his roller blades, but not in spirit, and the vicar s unorthodox methods have been well received by much of his parish @!PARISHIONER I think it s great. I think it s good. It s good for all the youngsters as well. There s nothing wrong with it. NATHAN THOMAS :( voice-over) But some of the young people he s trying to reach are as skeptical as the vicar s ability to keep his balance @!BOY It s pretty sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? BOY : Oh, because he s too old, you know. And he s just - - if he s a vicar, he s not being -- doing, like, vicar stuff. NATHAN THOMAS :( voice-over) But this vicar doesn t mind skidding off the straight and narrow or even falling on his cassock if it helps bring the church to the people, and the people into his church. Nathan Thomas, ABC News, London. ELIZABETH VARGAS : Vicar stuff. SPENCER CHRISTIAN : Yes. ELIZABETH VARGAS : I liked the two little kids. SPENCER CHRISTIAN : That s cute, that s neat stuff, yes. ELIZABETH VARGAS : That s great, good for him. What a bold guy? SPENCER CHRISTIAN : Yes, what if you fall every once in a while? Get up and do it again. ELIZABETH VARGAS : Hey, he ll get better. SPENCER CHRISTIAN : Yes. ELIZABETH VARGAS : Only room for improvement. SPENCER CHRISTIAN : Yes, exactly. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I got better.( Weather)( Commercial Break)
