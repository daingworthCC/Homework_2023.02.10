228341 GIVING THANKS @!JANE-PAULEY : Maybe you 're making travel plans or provisioning for the arrival of hungry hordes this Thursday, or just anticipating the feast. Well, so is everyone else. Thanksgiving is a uniquely American occasion that brings all of us together in a ritual as rich as it is plain. Harvest and home and giving thanks. But for the family you 're about to meet, Thanksgiving has become too painful to celebrate in the usual way. And yet, they have much to be grateful for. A young mother, a DATELINE survivor. @(Voiceover) Thanksgiving Day, 1997. Across the nation, it was a day for family, turkey with all the trimmings. And for seventy million Americans, a time-honored tradition, the Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade on TV. Two million people went to see the parade live that morning, including Kathy and Massimo Caronna. @(An-autumn-park-sce) @!Mr-MASSIMO-CARONNA : We were just going to go up to the parade then come back home and she was going to cook the turkey and we were just going to spend a whole day just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born eight months earlier. This was their first Thanksgiving together as a family. In some ways, it turned out to be their last. @(Pictures-of-Caronn) @!Mr-CARONNA : Kathy was very, very excited. She woke up very early. She woke me up, ' Come on, Massimo, let 's go, let 's go, let 's go. It 's going to start any moment. ' @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) Thanksgiving had particular meaning to the Caronnas. Kathy was born on a Thanksgiving day. @(Picture-of-Caronna) @!Ms-KATHY-CARONNA :( From home video) Thanksgiving Day. @!Mr-CARONNA :( From home video) Thanksgiving Day. @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) Their first trip to see the parade was a moment to be recorded for posterity, so they took the video camera. @(Footage-from-home-) @!Mr-CARONNA :( From home video) There 's Alessandro. @!Ms-CARONNA :( From home video) Where are we going? @!Mr-CARONNA :( From home video) We 're going to the parade! @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) They hurried across Central Park to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West, they worked their way to the front so Alessandro could have a good view of the Macy 's spectacle -- the procession of giant balloons. @(Footage-from-home-) @!Mr-CARONNA : @(Voiceover) We were just very excited. Alessandro was, like, smiling. @(Footage-from-home-) @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) It was a beautiful day, but deceptively windy, gusts up to 50 miles-per-hour. And at the intersection where the Caronnas stood, a wide cross-street sweeping into Central Park, the balloons might encounter a tunnel effect -- you see it happen right here. @(Peter-Rabbit-ballo) @!Mr-CARONNA : @(Voiceover) Kathy said, ' You know what, I 'm a little cold. Why do n't we just, you know, go home? ' And I said, ' No, let 's wait 10 minutes. ' So I held the baby like really high and Kathy was, you know, videotaping the parade. At that moment, I guess Cat in the Hat, you know, just came down on Central Park West. @(Footage-from-home-) @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) Dr. Seuss ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topped by a 18-foot hat, came bumbling down Central Park West. Buffeted by wind, it dragged and dodged its 40 handlers like an unruly child. For an eerie moment, it loomed above the lamppost where Kathy was standing, and almost seems to peer diabolically into her camera lens. Wedged against the arm of the lamppost, something had to give. One hundred pounds of cast iron came crashing down, striking Kathy on the side of her head, slamming her into the pavement. @(Footage-from-home-) @!Mr-CARONNA : I just turned around, and Kathy was on the floor. And I had the baby in my arm, and I just, you know, I thought life was over. @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) Kathy 's skull had been crushed. It was a hideous injury. @(Rescue-workers-lif) @!Mr-CARONNA : This police, this young guy, started to cry and looked at me... @(Voiceover)... and really scared. I says, ' Why are you crying? ' He said, ' Do n't worry, do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) At home, television viewers continued to watch the festivities oblivious to the tragedy. But at 72nd Street, the parade paused to let an ambulance rush Kathy to St. Lukes-Roosevelt Hospital. @(Ambulance-at-72nd-) @!PAULEY : At some point, a priest arrived, and that scared you. @!Mr-CARONNA : Even more so because usually in Italy when a priest comes to -- to a house or to a hospital, it means it 's over. And so I got really, really scared. And the doctor and the nurse were just staring at me. And I looked at my wife and said, ' What 's going on? ' And they just did n't answer. So I got even more scared. And then I came out, that 's when the priest came in. I 'm like, ' It 's over. ' @!Dr-JAMES-HUGHES : We felt that if we did n't operate that she would almost certainly die. @!PAULEY-@1Voiceover# @(Dr.-Hughes-examini) @!Dr-HUGHES : The skull was actually fractured so badly, it was split apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. First, the lamppost had smashed down on the left side of Kathy 's skull. And as she fell, the impact with the sidewalk left a baseball-sized indentation on the right side. Six hours after the accident, Dr. Hughes removed a shattered four-inch piece of Kathy 's skull to help relieve the severe swelling of her brain. The parade was long over. News reports of this unlikely accident beamed across the nation. qwq @( X-rays-with-the-hi Unidentified Anchor :( From newscast) Big trouble at Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade. @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) As families gathered around the table for Thanksgiving dinner, Massimo Caronna had little to be thankful for. Kathy was on a respirator, in a coma. The next day was her birthday. He spent the day, and every day for the next three weeks, by her side. @(Footage-of-Massimo) @!Mr-MASSIMO : @(Voiceover) Every morning was just another morning for me, hoping that she woke up, you know. @(Picture-of-Kathy) @!Mr-MASSIMO : Because every night I would go home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- did n't wake up. @!PAULEY : During those hours, was there any sign Kathy was still there? @!Mr-CARONNA : I mean, sometimes I would just, like, ask her to squeeze my fingers and sometimes she would squeeze. @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) Sometimes she would n't. The longer Kathy remained in a coma, the worse her chances for recovery. Dr. Hughes told Massimo that even if she did wake up, she could have suffered permanent brain damage. @(Pictures-of-Kathy-) @!Dr-HUGHES : Massimo was wonderful. He said, ' I do n't care how she is. I just want her to wake up, and we 'll deal with what comes after that. ' @!Mr-CARONNA : But I just wanted my wife to wake up. @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) Massimo says Kathy had been athletic. She loved rollerblading and skiing, but she was smart and ambitious. As a compliance analyst at a Wall Street investment bank, she made sure that complicated business deals conformed with law. And she spoke Italian. Kathy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @(Various-pictures-o) @!Mr-CARONNA : She sat across me and I was just like, " Whoa! " @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) It was the beginning of a new life, and such an auspicious start. It was Thanksgiving Day. @(Pictures-of-Caronn) @!Mr-CARONNA : @(Voiceover) We had so much in common it was incredible. @(Picture-of-Caronna) @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) She loved Italy, he 's Italian. Six months later they were married. @(Pictures-of-Caronn) @!PAULEY : Correct me if I 'm wrong, you were between jobs when you first met? @!Mr-CARONNA : When I met Kathy, actually, I was a waiter. I was in middle jobs. I was a waiter. @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) He says it was Kathy who encouraged him to start his own business. @(Home-video-of-Caro) @!Mr-CARONNA : Kathy pushed me to the lim -- to the -- to the limit. @(Home-video-of-Caro) @!Mr-CARONNA : You know, told me, ' Go get it. Come on, you can do it. You can do it. ' @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) Massimo began importing luxury Italian clothing to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @(Wedding-photo-of-C) @!PAULEY : Do you give Kathy credit for the success your business? @!Mr-CARONNA : Absolutely. I mean, if I am today where I am, it 's -- I would say probably 85 percent is Kathy. @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) And then Alessandro was born. @(Picture-of-Kathy-w) @!Mr-CARONNA : @(Voiceover) Everything was just wonderful. You know, my business was doing great, the baby was a joy, Kathy was very happy. And, you know, it was a little scary because usually in life, when everything gets too perfect, something always has to go in between, to... @(Home-video-of-Ales) @!PAULEY : Is that how you 've experienced life? @!Mr-CARONNA : Yeah. Absolutely. @!PAULEY : If it 's too good... @!Mr-CARONNA : Absolutely. @!PAULEY :... to look out? @!Mr-CARONNA : Absolutely. @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) Massimo kept his vigil by day and cared for the baby by night. Thanksgiving long past, it was well into December. There were subtle signs that Kathy was slowly waking up. Then, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : What happened? @!Mr-CARONNA : I went to the hospital and I was going to her room, and all the nurses start smiling at me. And I 'm like, ' Why is everybody smiling? ' Kathy was, like, sitting in the chair. I was just like ' Whoa! ' I mean, ' What happened here? ' I mean, you know, it was just a wonderful, wonderful feeling. It was nice. It was, just, you know, a miracle. @!PAULEY : Do you remember when the next day was that you had some really good news? Was it a long time coming? @!Mr-CARONNA : A long time coming. @!PAULEY : When we return, Kathy Caronna and her life one year later. @!Ms-CARONNA : It 's sad, you know, it 's just -- it 's frustrating. You know, it 's aggravating. @(Announcements) @!PAULEY : Back to our story. Now Kathy Caronna was of the world again. While she had no memory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face-to-face with its impact. She caught her own reflection in a hallway mirror. @!Mr-CARONNA : She looked at herself there, and -- and the next thing you know, she started, you know, to punch me and be like very upset. @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) She barely recognized herself. The old Kathy was simply gone. It was a new Kathy who woke up from the coma. qwq @( Hospital-room ; -pic @!Mr-CARONNA : She did n't look like Kathy, the Kathy that I knew, the Kathy that I met, the Kathy that I married. @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) In February, Kathy went home to build a new life. She had to wear helmet to protect the soft area where the piece of skull had been removed. Eventually, a metal plate was inserted to cover the spot. Her hair now covers that. @(Pictures-of-Kathy-) @!PAULEY : You had a four-inch section of your skull removed? @!Ms-CARONNA : From here, this mark here. @!PAULEY : I can barely see it. @!Ms-CARONNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) A miraculous job. And yet, far more than her appearance has changed. Doctors say her massive brain injuries caused a radical personality transformation. @(Caronnas-with-Paul) @!Dr-MARY-HIBBARD : Kathy is a very different person now. Kathy 's learning to live with Kathy. So is her husband. @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) Dr. Mary Hibbard has overseen Kathy 's rehabilitation at Mt. Sinai-NYU Medical Center. @!Ms-CARONNA :( In rehabilitation session) I feel like the baby. I 'm like ' Yeah! ' @!Dr-HIBBARD : Much of Kathy 's changes would be described almost as childlike, not childish. She 's very spontaneous in her responses. She will laugh more than she certainly did before. She will cry more than she did before. @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) Dr. Hibbard says if Kathy works again, it would n't be at the same level. @(Kathy-at-home-with) @!Dr-HIBBARD : This is a new Kathy, and this is the Kathy who will be. The Kathy who was, was really lost the day of the parade. @!PAULEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in on -- in an odd way, did n't you? @!Ms-CARONNA : Mm-hmm. It 's sad, you know. It 's just -- it 's frustrating. You know, it 's aggravating. Things have changed. I think that 's why I 'm trying to grasp ahold of life, getting back together. I 'll never be the same. @!Mr-CARONNA : It 's very difficult for me to explain what Kathy is now, because I do n't want to think about it. But I do see some changes, and the changes hurt. @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) At her best, Kathy is attractive and personable. But when she 's tired, she can be emotional, forgetful and disorganized. Reading books, watching movies, even TV, she has trouble following the story. @(Kathy-in-therapy-s) @!Ms-CARONNA :( With baby) Happy baby. @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) But Kathy was n't the only one who had changed. While she was in the hospital, Alessandro had grown from baby to toddler. @(Kathy-with-baby) @!Mr-CARONNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her. That was the difficult part, I think. @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) He 'd begun calling a family friend mommy in her long absence. And Kathy had to learn how to look after her child again. @(Kathy-with-baby) @!Ms-CARONNA : @(Voiceover) They were afraid of me dropping him one day, or seizures. @(Kathy-with-baby) @!Ms-CARONNA : Plus, getting used to the way he was growing up was a difficult period. It 's like coming in one day, two months later, he 's like crawling everywhere. And I missed that as well, the first crawl. @!PAULEY : Can you be a good mother to your son? @!Ms-CARONNA : Yeah. You know what? I love him. I just like hug him, say, ' Mommy loves you. Missed you a lot. ' @!Mr-CARONNA : Sometimes she gets frustrated also with the baby. And I get a little bit nervous, I 'd be honest with you, with that. You know, I say, ' Kathy, it 's a baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably the most scary part. @!Ms-CARONNA :( With baby) Where 's mommy? @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) But there 's no doubt Alessandro knows who his mother is now. Or that Massimo and Kathy 's marriage was not a casualty of that terrible accident. @(Caronnas-with-baby) @!PAULEY : Do you think you can ever have more children? @!Mr-CARONNA : I would love to. I would love to. @!PAULEY : Does Kathy want to? @!Ms-CARONNA : Mm-hmm. @!PAULEY : Kathy, tell me about your husband. Tell me about the man you married. @!Ms-CARONNA : Well, I 'm happy he 's been there for me. I 've been through hell. And so has he. It 's -- both a change in our life. I mean this whole incident. But our marriage has gr -- has grown fonder. @!Mr-CARONNA : That 's right. I 'm really close with Kathy, even more so, because I -- I know what she went through. And I 've got to give her a lot of credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!PAULEY : Are you in it for the duration? @!Mr-CARONNA : I 'm in it forever, absolutely. @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) They take comfort in the church. Now Kathy goes almost every day. She says she 's grateful to be alive, and that perhaps a merciful God took away the memory of the accident. The Caronnas still have the video they shot that day. They 'd never watched but told us they were finally ready to. @(Caronnas-in-church) @!Ms-CARONNA : Oh, God, who took that? @!Mr-CARONNA : You. @!Ms-CARONNA : Oh, there 's the lamppost. Oh dear. @!Mr-CARONNA : Amazing. It just happened so quick, it 's amazing. @!Ms-CARONNA : I had no recollection of that. @!Mr-CARONNA : It happened so fast. Not even a minute before, Kathy -- I says, ' Kathy, you 're tired, why do n't you give me the baby and you hold the video cam? ' @!Ms-CARONNA : Thank God I have a guardian angel. I 'm alive. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave him to him. That would have hit him as well. You know, so it 's -- you know, it upsets me. @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) In the 70-year history of the parade, there have only been two other accidents. In 1993, a similar incident left a policeman with a herniated disc and a fractured shoulder. Two years later, another lamppost was knocked down and a spectator suffered a broken finger. But after Kathy 's accident, some changes were made. @(Footage-from-parad) @!Mr-DENNISON-YOUNG : You learn lessons from past, from the whole past, and now we 're going forward. And we think we 've put this in a safe operation. @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) Dennison Young is counsel to New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani. @(Peter-Rabbit-ballo) @!Mr-YOUNG : @(Voiceover) Nothing is more paramount than the safety of the public. The public watching the parade... @(Peter-Rabbit-ballo) @!Mr-YOUNG :... want to enjoy the parade and not have to worry about what something might be coming crashing down on their heads. @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) The Caronnas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the city of New York among others, were negligent, careless and reckless. All the defendants deny the charges. Macy 's officials declined to talk to DATELINE on camera, citing the ongoing litigation, but in a written statement, said, " We sympathize with Mrs. Caronna and her family and continue to offer our most sincere wishes in her recovery. Since last year 's parade, we have worked to secure the safety of all participants and spectators alike. " Macy 's along with the city of New York, has worked to establish a host of new safety regulations governing the parade. From now on, there will be many more balloon handlers, and better training. Balloons will be smaller and tethered to vehicles. If the windspeed is greater than 23 miles-per-hour, they 'll be grounded. The Cat in the Hat balloon has been permanently retired from the parade. qwq @( Caronnas ' -home-vid @!PAULEY : Do you have nightmares? @!Ms-CARONNA : No. @!PAULEY : You 're not troubled by images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do see in the paper, the Cat in the Hat, I 'm like, ' Ooh, ' because it scares me a little. Seeing that, it 's like living my life, you know, again. @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) The Caronnas say they want to put the incident behind them. But with Thanksgiving approaching, the accident has been back in the news. @(Caronna-family-wal) @!Mr-CARONNA : @(Voiceover) Sometimes the news is showing the incident again. @(Caronna-family-wal) @!Mr-CARONNA : Sometimes I do n't want to see it. I -- I just, you know, say, ' Kathy, change the channel. Come on. Let 's do n't look at it. Let 's just play. Let 's play. Let 's have a good time with the baby, ' Because I just want to move on. @!PAULEY : @(Voiceover) This Thursday, while millions of us wake up to the Macy 's parade like we always have, the Caronnas will be somewhere else, out of the country, far away. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to be thankful for that day, though. @!Ms-CARONNA : Um-hmm. Life. @!Mr-CARONNA : That 's right. @!PAULEY : Born on a Thanksgiving Day, Kathy Caronna met her husband on a Thanksgiving Day, and nearly died on Thanksgiving Day. The coincidences are eerie, to say the least. There 's more. Just one week before Kathy 's accident, she bought her son a bunch of books, Dr. Seuss books, including " The Cat in the Hat. " Alessandro may be ready for books now, but Kathy and Massimo are n't quite ready for that book. Announcer : Coming up next -- how Hollywood gets big bangs on the big screen. A DATELINE State of the Art. @(Announcements)
