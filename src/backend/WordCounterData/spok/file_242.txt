5000541 @5830-AM-EDT@6 @5Garth-Brooks-perform@7 @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : And that 's Garth Brooks from his upcoming special. We 're going to talk about that in a moment. But first, welcome back to CBS THIS MORNING. Right now it 's time to show you some of this morning 's headlines. The New York Times says the -- the Justice Department charged two Iranians with -- with hacking attacks on U.S. cities. They 're accused of taking over computer systems at U.S. businesses, hospitals, and government agencies. Prosecutors say the hackers demanded payment by Bitcoin to unlock data. The attacks cost victims more than thirty million dollars in losses. The suspects are believed to be in Iran, but prosecutors believe they 'll be caught eventually. @1BIANNA-GOLODRYGA@2 : The Wall Street Journal says sales at Dick 's Sporting Goods fell nearly four percent in the latest quarter. The largest decline since it took a tough stance against guns. The company announced in February after the Parkland school shooting that it would stop selling assault-style guns and would no longer sell guns and ammo to people under twenty-one. Weakness in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of the decline in sales. @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : The Washington Post says children who start school at a younger age are more likely to get a diagnosis of ADHD even if they do n't have it. Harvard University researchers found younger children in a classroom are thirty percent more likely to be diagnosed. They say children may be improperly diagnosed when they are just immature. The American Psychiatric Association estimates that five percent of children have ADHD. @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : The Oregonian in Portland says older drivers who take a concerning number of drugs still drive. AAA study found nearly half of the drivers between the ages of sixty-five and seventy-nine took seven or more prescription medicines. Many older people do n't understand how the drugs they take can interact with each other. About twenty percent of those medications are proven to dramatically increase a driver 's risk of a crash. @1BIANNA-GOLODRYGA@2 : And USA Today says the holidays are boxed in by a recycling crisis. Million -- some of the millions of boxes delivered to our homes may not get recycled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our recyclable materials driving out the cost of recycling. Some cities are raising collection fees. Others are thinking of ditching their recycling programs altogether. @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : For many people, Garth Brooks is country music. The superstar is the best-selling solo artist in U.S. history. That 's right. He has sold more than one hundred and forty-eight million albums. Brooks recently made history by performing the first concert ever at Notre Dame Stadium, and that groundbreaking show will be broadcasting -- be broadcast this Sunday as a CBS special. @5Excerpt-from-Garth-@7 @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : And Garth Brooks is here. Good morning. @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 @5Country-Music-Singer@6 : Good morning. How are you all? @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : Good morning. @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : Happy holidays. @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : Yes. Happy holidays. @1BIANNA-GOLODRYGA@2 : Me, too. @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : It 's so terrific to hear you. Think about Notre Dame Stadium. I think it 's like eighty-eight years old. They 've had nine championships, Notre Dame team. What was it like to play in that stadium? @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, you know, I 'll -- I 'll remember the call the rest of my life when the call starts, are you familiar with Notre Dame Stadium? Yeah, a little bit. So they wanted their first ever concert there. For some reason, they picked us. And I got to tell you, the crowd that showed up stole the show. @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : Yeah. It was like eighty-eight thousand people. @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : They were -- they were very sweet. Just -- they were so cool because they were battling weather. They were doing all this. But they came sports-minded( INDISTINCT), they bundled up and they sang their butts off. It was a lot of fun. @1BIANNA-GOLODRYGA@2 : Of course, you 're used to big crowds, though. We remember over twenty years ago -- @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : Yes. @1BIANNA-GOLODRYGA@2 : -- your big concert in Central Park here in New York City. I believe the last estimates were close to a million -- @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : Yeah. It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Your music transcends all party lines, all music lines. What do you think -- what do you think makes that happen? @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : You know, I do n't know. But it 's fun to look out and see all the colors. @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : Mm-Hm. @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : All the races. Half guys, half girls. @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : Mm-Hm. @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : It 's good to see. And it 's good to see different beliefs out there because, I 'm sorry, man, I know this is not a popular thought, but I think it 's our differences, that it 's our strength, you know? And I think we need us all. So I can verify that at a Garth show, we need every one of them, everything. They 're all singing, it 's fun. @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : What 's it feel like when you 're walking on to a stage that 's that big? Does it just feel like a little bit different? Or do you think, wow, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Notre Dame, it 's -- it 's -- like you said, it 's an older stadium so there 's only one way in, one way out, right? So when they introduce you, you got to walk through the people to get to the stage. So they introduce you. But fifteen minutes later, you finally get to the stage because you 're hugging everybody, shaking everybody 's hand. And by the time you hit that stage, you felt so much like a family that it was just a party from the word go. It was a lot of fun. @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : What 's the challenge in terms of making sure that the people in the back row feel just as included as those that are sitting on the floor in the front row? @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : Yeah. Man, you got to find them. And -- and, you know, if you do this for a living you were a fan first. So you 've been to concerts and you know what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a concert do n't dump a whole new album on me. Give me the old stuff that 's what I came there for, you know. @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : That I know how to sing. @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : Right. Exactly. @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : Yeah. @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : And then there 's a big thing, it 's just -- you just want that three seconds to look right in the eyes of George Strait or Freddie Mercury when I was a teenager. @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : Mm-Hm. @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : And go, man, thank you. Thank you for what your music 's done for me. Well, now that the tables have switched and you 're on stage, it 's funny, you 're looking at everybody for that three seconds to go, thank you for my life, thank you for my kids ' life. Yeah. @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : Is that something -- okay, hang -- stay with me here, Garth. In football, they sometime say it 's only until the first hit -- @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : Yes. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Is it until you get that moment, that connection that, you know, okay, I 'm locked in, you go? @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : Yeah. Yeah. It 's fun because you 're scared to death. You do n't want to disappoint anybody. All you can think about is keep your gut sucked in, keep your gut sucked in when you 're singing. And two lines in, you 're lost. It 's a party. It 's -- it 's so much fun. @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : What do -- @1BIANNA-GOLODRYGA@2 : Talk about how country music has evolved over the years. @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : Country music always changes. So now that you 're one of the older guys you 're looked upon as one of the traditionalists, right? But when we first started out, you guys remember this, we were not considered the traditionalists. We were the trouble makers, right? So I think it always just turns that page because country music is always changing. It is the news put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to change with time. @1BIANNA-GOLODRYGA@2 : We always consider you the nicest guys. Right? @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : Oh. @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : How do you -- or do you need to get back to that moment when you were playing tor tips that first time? Do you feel -- that -- that getting place for you? And how do you get back there when you 're playing on a stage that 's this big which is really different from where you started out? @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : They say time is a friend to all things good. I also think time does n't affect good things. So for me, it 's the same as when you first started playing. It does n't matter if it 's five people, if it 's a million people in Central Park, it 's still all about that one-on-one. If you can establish that, and I got to tell you, man, they come there -- I know because I went to so many concerts as a fan, you go there wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that connection. So it 's pretty easy to get that connection for sure. @1BIANNA-GOLODRYGA@2 : And music is really a family business for you, obviously. Your wife, Trisha Yearwood, we love her too. We know your children sing as well, your daughters. Talk about the struggle for women in the industry -- @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : Oh. @1BIANNA-GOLODRYGA@2 : -- because you said it is a thousand times harder for women in country music than men. @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : Yeah. The phrase is a woman 's got to work a thousand times harder to get a tenth as much. It 's just what -- and I do n't know why. What I really enjoyed about the ' 90s was the female voice in country music was about fifty-fifty. And I think that brings a whole new voice because women reason. They just do. Guys, we 're -- we 're just -- we 're just guys, we 're stupid, we always are. You know, we 're -- we 're always going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when you get a voice of reason, I just think it makes things better. @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : So, Trisha Yearwood, your wife -- @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : Yes. @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : -- for those out there who do n't know, Trisha Yearwood, you guys have been married for a while, you surprised her at the CMAs with the song. @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : Mm-Hm. @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : Did she really not know what you were going to sing? @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : Did n't have a clue. And hats off to everybody, the studio musicians that cut the song two months before, the engineer, are the only ones that have heard it. And even Robert Deaton, the -- the dude that does everything, he does the Billboard Awards, CMAs. This is the -- the -- the most busy cat on the planet, drives out to your house to listen to the song at your house because there 's no other recording of it -- @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : Oh. @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : -- to do his notes and stuff. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do. So everyone kind of chipped in for the surprise for her. @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : So did she like it? @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : Yes. She liked it. @1BIANNA-GOLODRYGA@2 : She was happy? @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : She was -- it was good for us too as our relationship, because it opened a lot of doors for us to talk about things we never got past. You know, you guys know this. You have the same arguments. Always come to the same place. And this song actually helped us get past a couple points, which is great. So the song has been a real gift to us. @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : Do you mind sharing what that -- what -- what was one of those struggles you had? @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : It was just -- it 's -- it 's when you have two people in the house that kind of do the same thing, then you always have two people that are -- are loving one another so what you do is you back down so the other one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down, nothing ever gets done. So it was kind of that brave thing of, " Look, man, just tell me what you 're thinking. You 're not going to hurt my feelings. You love me, I love you to death. Let 's just be really gut-wrenching honest with each other. " Never ask that from your wife ever because -- @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : Because, you know -- @5Cross-talking@6 @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : -- it got gut-wrenching honest. @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : Yes. @1BIANNA-GOLODRYGA@2 : She opened Pandora 's box, right? @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : Women reason and sometimes they reason too strong. @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : Yeah. Well, sometimes they 're too right, that 's the problem. @1BIANNA-GOLODRYGA@2 : I do n't want to over generalize. You know, I mentioned that we always think that country musicians are the nicest folk. But every time we talk about people who we interview and it comes to country music, you guys are grounded, there 's a spiritual strength that you have. And you are genuinely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @1BIANNA-GOLODRYGA@2 : What is it that keeps you going and -- and keeps you so -- so grounded? @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : I 'm about to expose all of rock, pop, and rap, okay. When they 're not talking to you guys, they 're the sweetest people on the planet. I just think it 's a thing that they do for their format. But let 's take the group KISS, okay. You 're not going to get crazier than that. They come in to record, they 're doing the tribute album in Nashville. Sweetest guys on the planet. I 've blown their cover right now. @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : Yeah. @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : They were showing baby pictures. They 're just the nicest guys. But when they start to walk out on the street, they became them again, right? So I think it 's -- I think all of us are humans underneath and I think you just got to get to it. @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : Mm-Hm. @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : You said you went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now? Who 's on your -- @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : I got to tell you of the -- of the new stuff that I just love. Ed Sheeran 's got my ear right now so much simply because of what all he does out of just what he is playing. Gaga has more guts in this business than any male that 's in it, so I love it. And I do n't think you get better than Adele. I got to tell you, I just -- I just floored with her. On the country side, you got guys like Ashley McBryde, who 's a singer-songwriter, when you talk about a woman that 's working a thousand times to get a tenth as much. But people are listening to her and that 's smart because she 's got a lot of good things to say. @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : Wow. @1BIANNA-GOLODRYGA@2 : You 're also listening to your -- your daughters, right? Briefly mentioned that -- @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : Little Allie is -- is trying her hand at music. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know, you do n't want to get in the way of it and she is -- she is learning a ton. This is the best time to be an artist because this is where you 're just filling up your brain with everything that you 're learning. @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : Well, Garth Brooks, so great to have you. @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : It 's a pleasure. @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : And still -- and still looking forward to Sunday night. @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : Thank you. This is going to be fun. @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : Thank you. @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : Yeah. @1BIANNA-GOLODRYGA@2 : Great to see you. @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : And you can see Garth : Live at Notre Dame this Sunday night right here on CBS. And Garth Brooks will be a guest tonight on CBS ' The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. You 'll have fun. @1BIANNA-GOLODRYGA@2 : This was a fun conversation. @1GARTH-BROOKS@2 : Thank you very much. Right back to you. Happy holidays. @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : Yes. @1BIANNA-GOLODRYGA@2 : Well, in our More Perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of so-called Jewish pen -- penicillin. @1JOHN-BLACKSTONE@2 : What is the magic of chicken soup? @1RABBI-SHMUEL-TIECHTE@3 : It 's warm, it 's homey. It makes you feel better. And it 's not just the chicken soup, it 's the fact that somebody thought to come and give it to you -- the fact that someone cares. I think chicken soup shows caring with love. @1BIANNA-GOLODRYGA@2 : I grew up on that penicillin. Ahead, how the rabbi and his wife delivered to help college students with a cold. But first, a check of your local weather. @5LOCAL-WEATHER-BREAK@6 @5ANNOUNCEMENTS@6
