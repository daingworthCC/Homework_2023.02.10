232641 CLINTON 'S CHOICE @!CHARLES-KURALT-ho : We will be hearing about Clinton 's Choice pretty nearly every day for the next few weeks. The president-elect has plenty of choices to make, in everything from staff to style. Will he put a swing on the porch of the White House? Will he wear blue jeans in the Rose Garden? Our Cover Story this morning, reported by David Culhane, asks a more important fashion question : To whom will he give the black robes of justice? qwq @( Footage-of-the-Sup Governor BILL CLINTON( President-Elect) :( Voiceover) I want, first of all, my appointees to the Supreme Court to be people of unquestioned ability. I want them to have a good educational background. I want them to have intellectual firepower to do the job. I want them to have compassion. @!DAVID-CULHANE-repo : After he takes office, President-elect Clinton will immediately be able to name more than 100 federal judges to fill existing vacancies. And he may have an early opportunity to be the first Democrat in 25 years to appoint a Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- they may want to disagree with some of the decisions they made or some of the views they hold, but when I name people to the Supreme Court, I want them to say immediately, ' Well, there 's somebody who 's clearly qualified to serve. ' @(Footage-of-Supreme) @!CULHANE :( Voiceover) Five members of this Supreme Court and more than 500 other federal judges were appointed by presidents Reagan and Bush. Now that revolution, designed to fill the federal benches with conservatives, is over. @(Footage-of-Clinton) @!CULHANE :( Voiceover) President-elect Clinton is expected to try to swing the pendulum toward the center and perhaps even in a more liberal direction. Conservatives, like legal scholar Bruce Fein, were in deep distress at the Clinton victory. @(Footage-of-Bruce-F) @!Mr-BRUCE-FEIN-@1Le : But there is n't a shadow of a doubt that the highest hopes of the conservatives were crushed with that particular victory, because it was clear, without a new member on the court of the Scalia-Clarence Thomas mold, this court was stuck in dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delighted. Professor Herman Schwartz who teaches constitutional law at American University in Washington, remembers his emotion when Clinton clinched his victory. @!Mr-HERMAN-SCHWARTZ : Joy, glee, relief. More, I think, than anything else, relief that the sharp rightward drift will be slowed down and, over a period of years, perhaps arrested. @(Footage-from-a-pro) @!CULHANE :( Voiceover) A whole range of issues would eventually be affected : abortion, school prayer and other church/state relationships, the rights of defendants and, of course civil rights. qwq @( Footage-from-a-pro qwq @( Footage-from-a-ral Congressman JOHN LEWIS( Georgia, Democrat) :( Voiceover) During the ' 60s, we saw the United States Supreme Court as a sympathetic referee in the struggle for civil rights. @(Footage-of-John-Le) @!CULHANE :( Voiceover) Democratic Congressman John Lewis of Georgia has been a leader in the civil rights movement for three decades. @!Cong-LEWIS : The Supreme Court was looked upon as our friend, as the court that would make things right, but do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ :( Voiceover) But the federal courts grew less sympathetic to civil rights during the 1980s and Lewis says one reason minorities voted for Clinton was to change the federal judiciary. @(Footage-of-Lewis) @!Cong-LEWIS : It is our hope and -- and prayer, with the election of Clinton that we will have a different mindset on the United States Supreme Court -- that the court itself will be more representative of what America is all about. @(Footage-of-Preside) @!CULHANE :( Voiceover) The 1991 civil rights bill was designed to counter several Supreme Court decisions that made it more difficult to prove job discrimination. Now that civil rights bill itself is expected to generate new cases before the federal courts. @(Footage-of-Schwart) @!Mr-SCHWARTZ : There 's currently a controversy about whether the 1991 Civil Rights Act is retroactive. @!CULHANE :( Voiceover) Schwartz thinks that the Clinton administration will have significant influence on what issues reach the Supreme Court. @!Mr-SCHWARTZ : I think the major impact of the new administration 's arrival would be that many of the statutory and regulatory matters would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did and came out contrary to what Congress wanted, legislation would be possible to overturn it, instead of facing a presidential veto. @(Footage-of-the-Sup) @!CULHANE :( Voiceover) Eight of the nine justices on today 's court were appointed by Republicans ; only Byron White was named by a Democrat -- John Kennedy. qwq @( Picture-of-John-Ke @(Picture-of-Lyndon-) @!CULHANE :( Voiceover) Lyndon Johnson was the last Democratic president to name a justice -- Thurgood Marshall in 1967. @(Footage-of-Harry-B) @!Mr-FEIN :( Voiceover) The vacancy that 's most likely to occur is the seat of Justice Harry Blackmun, and he is already as far liberal as you can get. @(Footage-of-Culhane) @!Mr-FEIN :( Voiceover) So to replace Harry Blackmun with another liberal wo n't change the chemistry on the high court. @!CULHANE :( Voiceover) Conservative scholar Bruce Fein thinks the court movement to the right really stopped last June when three conservative justices affirmed the Roe versus Wade abortion rights decision. @!Mr-FEIN : David Souter, Anthony Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor -- all justices appointed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roe versus Wade being the rule of the day today. The abortion area is settled until you have a Republican president who 's able to fill a vacancy that comes from the liberal side. @(Footage-from-prote) @!CULHANE :( Voiceover) But Nadine Strossen, the national president of the American Civil Liberties Union, disagrees. @(Footage-of-Culhane) @!CULHANE :( Voiceover) She says there will be a major assault on the court for decisions curtailing abortion rights. @!Ms-NADINE-STROSSEN : For large groups of women in this society, there is no real reproductive freedom anymore. The Supreme Court held that short of an outright criminal ban on abortion, virtually any regulation goes. Justice Blackmun said when a so-called right is so circumscribed by obstacles to its exercise, it ceases to be a right at all. @(Footage-from-prote) @!CULHANE :( Voiceover) The anti-abortion forces were shocked when the high court left Roe versus Wade standing. And the election means these organizations have no hope of another justice to support their position. @(Footage-of-Nancy-M) @!Ms-NANCY-MYERS-@1N : Obviously, it 's disappointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, because he has embraced the pro-abortion agenda so wholly. @!CULHANE :( Voiceover) Nancy Myers of the National Right to Life Committee. @!Ms-MYERS : The focus will shift to Congress primarily and the Freedom of Choice Act, which essentially says abortion on demand. And we 're going to be working against that because it just goes too far. @(Footage-from-prote) @!CULHANE :( Voiceover) President-elect Clinton says he is not totally comfortable with litmus-tests for Supreme Court nominees, but he has said he will apply one to ensure that they support an abortion rights position. Conservatives are outraged. Bruce Fein. @(Footage-of-Fein) @!Mr-FEIN : It 's totally improper to try to extract from your nominees particular commitments on particular cases, as opposed to just getting a general sense of what their philosophy was. @(Picture-of-Abraham) @!CULHANE :( Voiceover) Fein recalls what Abraham Lincoln said when asked if he would apply a litmus test on slavery for court nominees. @!Mr-FEIN : And the substance of Lincoln 's remark was ' I would be a scoundrel if I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for it. ' @(Footage-of-Culhane) @!CULHANE :( Voiceover) Liberals emphatically disagree. Nadine Strossen. @!Ms-STROSSEN : It would be the height of irresponsibility for a president or a senator not to be deeply concerned about and to try to ascertain the views of the nominees and to make sure that the views of the nominees coincide with the president 's or the senator 's views as to important human rights issues. @(Footage-of-the-Sup) @!CULHANE :( Voiceover) The 12-year Reagan/Bush drive to pack the Supreme Court and other federal benches with conservative judges has been halted. Now the pendulum is set to swing the other way. Congressman John Lewis. @(Footage-of-Lewis) @!Cong-LEWIS : We 're not going to see a -- a -- a revolution, any radical change overnight. But I think with the new administration, you can set si -- things in motion ; you can create the climate, the environment for change. @(Footage-of-Clinton) @!Gov-CLINTON : I can, and I will, pledge you a federal judiciary that looks like America, feels like America and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
