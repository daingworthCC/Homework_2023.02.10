A tale of his book tour now from author of " The Big Five-Oh! " ; that would be Bill Geist. qwq @( Close-up-of- " Big-F @!BILL-GEIST-reporti : @(Voiceover) It 's not enough to just write a book anymore. More than 60,000 new books will be published this year, and to make yours stand out, you have to go from being an author to a traveling salesman. @(Footage-of-alarm-c) @!GEIST : Five-thirty wake-up. I need coffee, bad. @(Footage-of-Geist-w) @!GEIST : @(Voiceover) The modern-day book tour is a cross-country forced march marked by sleep deprivation, meals on the run... Brain food. @(Footage-of-Geist-a) @!GEIST : @(Voiceover)... and strategic planning sessions held on garbage cans with my publicist Karen. Joan Rivers is funny, so that should be good. @!Mr-DON-IMUS-@1Radi : We 're talking with Bill Geist whose book " The Big Five-Oh!

Now can you give us a visual demons... @!GEIST : I think everybody is familiar with that. You start to get out of the car, and you ca n't quite do it. And you kind of have to get a little -- it 's kind of one of those things where you have to double-pump to get out of a taxi or a car. @(Footage-of-Geist-w) @!Ms-JOAN-RIVERS-@1R : @(Voiceover)... called " The Big Five-Oh!

Unidentified Man 2 : You 're welcome. @!GEIST : Fox. @(Footage-of-Geist-e) @!GEIST : @(Voiceover) With no time for meals, authors have to scrounge around in Green Rooms. Decent spread : you 've got the fruit, the cookies, the dips for the vegetables. @(Footage-of-Geist-e) @!GEIST : @(Voiceover) Green Rooms are some of the most bizarre places in America these days. You 're the Israeli ambassador to the UN? Unidentified Man 3 : Correct. @(Footage-of-Geist-a) @!GEIST : @(Voiceover) Look at this mix : We have a female jockey and this author of a book on turning 50, who 's chatting with an Israeli ambassador, when a PLO spokesman walks in.

Unidentified Woman 4 : Except for The Rolling Stones themselves. @!GEIST :... except for The Rolling Stones. Can you get me into the local AARP, maybe a spot on the shuffleboard team? Unidentified Man 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I probably wo n't win the National Book Award, but they did proclaim it... Man 4 : The Bill Geist Day in Bergen County. So it 's a... @!GEIST : Wow. Great. Thank you very much. @(Footage-of-Geist-a) @!GEIST : @(Voiceover) Take that, John Grisham. Thank you-all very much. I appreciate that.

Hop in. @!GEIST : Very funny. I like the full service. @(Footage-of-Young-p) @!GEIST : @(Voiceover) Bill rushes me to some suburban cable TV outlets.

I need a doughnut. @!Mr-YOUNG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You need a doughnut like you need malaria. @(Footage-of-Geist-a) @!GEIST : @(Voiceover) Book tours bear marked similarities to political campaigns, moving from one city to the next, giving the same speech over and over and over again, no matter what the question. I start out in the book talking about getting my AARP card. The American Association of Retired Persons... And that 's just a horrible moment in your life. And they somehow know when everyone turns 50. And suddenly there you are and you just scream when you get it and fall on the couch because... @(Footage-of-Geist-a) @!GEIST : @(Voiceover) Next was the Chicago Tribune where I used to work and where old friends did their level best to embarrass me...

We do have light in Dallas. @!GEIST : It does get light in Dallas. @!Ms-MARKOWITZ : It does. It 's just not... @!GEIST : Where to next? @!Ms-MARKOWITZ : Now we 're going down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are we going? @!Ms-MARKOWITZ : And then after that we 're going to ABC, to WFAA... @!GEIST : " Good Morning Texas.
