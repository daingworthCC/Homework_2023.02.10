224941 PAULA @!ZAHN, co-host : Topic A this morning : The budget that barely survived. After a long night of horse trading and arm twisting, the administration got its budget through the Senate only by having Vice President Al Gore break a tie vote. Why was it so close? Well, Budget Director Leon Panetta joins us from the White House with the answer to that and many of the other details, we hope, on the ever-changing budget plan. Good morning. Nice to see you again. @!Mr-LEON- : Hi, Paula. Nice to be with you. @!ZAHN : Thank you for joining us. Even though the Democrats are controlling the Senate, you still had six of them voting against the president 's plan. Why was the vote so close? @!PANETTA : Well, we -- we always knew this would be a tough vote. The fact is that these are not easy decisions when you 're cutting benefits, when you 're cutting spending, when you 're raising taxes -- no matter if it 's on the wealthiest in the society, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think we were looking at a lot of profiles in courage with those who voted with us. And obviously those that voted against us were concerned either about the next election or were concerned about the position that Republicans held that somehow there ought not to be any revenues whatsoever in this package. So there were a lot of reasons, but I think the bottom line is we won. And like in sports, one run counts, here one vote counts. @!ZAHN : You really believe that it 's the symbolism that counts ; that -- that the margin of victory really is n't all that important ; it 's the fact of victory, as Senator Mitchell said? @!PANETTA : Well, my -- my experience is when it comes to big votes like this that are tough, there are -- in history, there are a lot of close votes, but in the end, we got the package through. That 's what counts. And now we are on the way to getting an economic package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!ZAHN : Do you concede, though, that you got the victory at a price? In fact, you had to make some last-minute deals with liberal Democrats when it came to Medicare cuts that were trimmed from $ 67 billion to $ 58 billion. You also had to increase the amount of equipment writeoffs -- that a lot of people were n't to happy about -- by about 5,000 bucks. Are you satisfied with those deals or do you wish those had not -- had to have been cut? @!PANETTA : Well, we always took the position, particularly with regards to the Senate, that we wanted to stand to the side of the president and his principles with regards to this package. But we all knew that the leadership -- George Mitchell, Pat Moynihan -- had to work all the members to try to ensure that we got this package through the Senate. They had to make modifications. They had to be able to make some deals with members in order to try to get their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that package through. And I think that, in the end, is what counts. @!ZAHN : Well, let 's go back to what you were talking about earlier, President Clinton 's principles. How are you going to get this bill back closer to where the president would be completely satisfied with it once it goes through conference committee? @!PANETTA : Well, the president has alway made very clear the principles that he has with regards to this entire package. First of all, it 's -- it 's got to be $ 500 billion in deficit reduction and it 's got to be set aside specifically for that purpose. Secondly, it 's got to be progressive. We 've got to make sure that we have a shared burden here and it does n't just impact on working families or on the middle class. Thirdly, that we 've got to make investments. We 've got to provide investments for business, we 've also got to provide investments in human needs with regards to our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at least some form of broad-based energy tax as part of this overall package. Those are the principles. We 're, going to have to obviously fight for those in conference. But I think we 've go a very good chance of getting a resolution here and getting this plan in place. @!ZAHN : Well, let 's talk about the broad-based energy tax, which you just mentioned. Are you saying there 's going to be no compromise on that, that the president will want to go back to what that looked like when the House agreed to it, when they all claimed they walked the plank to get the president 's plan through for the broad-based energy tax? @!PANETTA : Well, it 's always when you... @!ZAHN : Will the gas tax go? @!PANETTA : When you get to a conference and the House has passed one version and the Senate another approach, they 're going to have to try to find a resolution somewhere in the middle. @!ZAHN : Will the president budge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a broad-based BTU tax? @!PANETTA : Well, no, I think he 's committed to some kind of broad-based energy approach in the -- in the country, and I think that involves probably trying to find some compromise between the House and the Senate. I think the bottom line is here is that we have got to get a resolution that carries a majority now in both the House and the Senate. And as you saw in the Senate, that is not going to be an easy task. We have got to get this package done. That 's what counts. The reason we have n't had deficit reduction in the past is because everybody has a great plan but nobody 's been able to get it through the Congress. We 've got a chance to get it done. @!ZAHN : Budget Director Leon Panetta, thank you so much for joining us this morning. @!PANETTA : Thank you. @!ZAHN : We 'll let you get some sleep. Everybody was up late last night. Fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you 're waiting with bated breath to see what that tattoo finally looks like. Look at that right there. What happens next? Well, stay with us and you 'll find out. Well, Monday on CBS THIS MORNING, Dr. Howard Torman on figuring your exact risk of breast cancer. Plus, Hollywood fights back against video pirates. And we 'll talk with " Sleepless In Seattle " star Tom Hanks.
