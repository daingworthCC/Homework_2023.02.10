222241 THE EDUCATION OF LUIS GUTIERREZ @!MORLEY-SAFER : Remember all that talk about change in Washington, how all those new faces in Congress would ride into town and clean up the place, take it back from the lobbyists, put an end to congressional perks and the power of special interests? That was a year ago. So what 's happened since? Very, very little. Just ask Luis Gutierrez, a young congressman from Chicago. He called Washington, ' the belly of the beast, ' and went there to change it. Instead, he got an education. @(Footage-of-Congres) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) More than 25 percent of the old Congress had been turned out and 110 new, bright, shining faces turned up to pose for their class picture on the Capitol steps, 110 straight arrows. Among them, but so hard to single out -- we had to use John Madden 's chalkboard -- is Luis Gutierrez. He truly believed that together, they would slay the dragon of business-as-usual. Congressman LUIS GUTIERREZ( Democrat, Illinois) :( Voiceover) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people all running to the same finish line. All of us saying, ' We 're going to do campaign-finance reform, we 're going to eliminate the parking at National Airport, the chauffeurs are gone, the perks and the privileges, the things that make us different. Well, people take that stuff pretty personal here. They take it as a personal affront to themselves. @!SAFER : You mean, it 's OK to say it in the campaign, but when you start saying... @!Cong-GUTIERREZ : When you say it at a roundtable discussion with 30 other members and suggest that we should get together and formulate a strategy and -- a -- a strategic plan... @!SAFER : To actually change things... @!Cong-GUTIERREZ :... to actually change things, people begin to say to you, ' Luis, that will come later. That will come later. First, learn what you 're going to give up before you try to give it up. ' @!SAFER : You called this place, ' the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the belly of the beast '? @!Cong-GUTIERREZ : It 's still the belly of the beast today. Yes, it 's -- it 's a monster. It 's a monster. @(Footage-of-the-Cap) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) A hungry monster that eats young congressmen for breakfast. The Washington watchdog group, Common Cause, and its president, Fred Wertheimer, have been tracking the freshman class. @!Mr-FRED-WERTHEIMER : We have two-thirds of them on public record -- written, signed statements -- that they would support and vote for legislation that would fundamentally change the way business is done in this town. @!SAFER : And since? @!Mr-WERTHEIMER : Well, they got here. It 's a little variation on the old saying, ' They came, they saw, they were conquered. ' @(Footage-of-Gutierr) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) : A few of them, including Luis Gutierrez, resisted. At home in Chicago, this son of Puerto Rican parents is called El Gallito, the Little Fighting Rooster. Ten years ago, he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers to the office of Mayor Richard Daley. Now he helps deliver Democrats to Mayor Daley 's son -- Mayor Daley. He represents a district made up of Latinos, blacks, Irish, Poles and Ukrainians. Before he took his seat in Congress, he was invited, along with other freshmen, to meet Democratic House leaders Foley, Rostenkowski, Gephardt and others. He thought they wanted to lead the charge for change. @!Cong-GUTIERREZ : I 'm sorry that I was stupid and foolish enough to believe that. @(Footage-of-Gutierr) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) Gutierrez was foolish enough to believe that the older hands actually wanted to hear what he had to say about the low opinion the public had of Congress, so he spoke up. @!Cong-GUTIERREZ : And they basically told me to shut up. But I was acting respectful to the House leadership. I was showing deference to them and saying, ' I want you to help us, because together -- ' because I was including myself as an equal member. Bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not amused. In other words, ' Shut up and go along. ' @!Cong-GUTIERREZ : The basic gist of it : ' You 're a freshman. Maybe you should n't even be seen, much less heard in the Congress of the United States. ' @!SAFER : What did the other young Turks do? Did they give you a wide berth or what? @!Cong-GUTIERREZ : My fellow freshmen colleagues -- not all of them -- but a few of them, said, ' Mr. Speaker, I just want you to know that I do n't share Luis Gutierrez 's sentiments whatsoever, that I think that you 're a fine, generous, noble man. Mr. Speaker, I think the freshman from Chicago is trying to divide us. We 're all Democrats, and we need to act as Democrats, and we need to walk out of this room as one and to show the world that we 're ready to fight and work with President Clinton. ' So now I was anti-Clinton ; I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voiceover) Luis Gutierrez had gotten through his first lesson before he even got to Washington. His second came shortly after, the night of President Clinton 's first address to a joint session of Congress in which he pledged to cut government salaries. President BILL CLINTON : Tonight, I call for an across-the-board freeze in federal government salaries for one year. @(Footage-of-Congres) @!Cong-GUTIERREZ :( Voiceover) Yet the Congress of the United States was clapping, ' Yeah, Mr. President. ' ' Hit them hard, ' right? @!SAFER : At the State of the Union. @!Cong-GUTIERREZ : Well -- State of the Union address. Of course, every member knew that they were going to be exempted from that pay freeze. @(Footage-of-a-docum) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) So the very next day, Gutierrez decided to write a bill to freeze congressmen 's salaries. How did that sit with his colleagues? @!Cong-GUTIERREZ : There 's a -- a chairman of a committee, someone who I have a lot of respect for his work here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the American people. And I was coming over on the -- the trolley car -- there was a vote -- and he said, ' Are n't you Congressman Luis Gutierrez? ' And I looked at him and I said -- made my day. I 've only been here, like, six or seven weeks and this guy absolutely knows who I am. And he says, ' Did n't you introduce the pay freeze? Are you the same one? ' At that point, I knew I was in trouble, you know what I mean? I knew I was in trouble. And I said, ' Yes, sir. ' And he said, ' Well, that 's good. Let me tell you something, young man, ' he said, ' do n't you ever introduce legislation that sticks your hand in my pocket. ' Now I have to tell you that I was taken aback. @!SAFER : Luis Gutierrez, only a few months in Congress, had already made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troublemaker. House Speaker Tom Foley told Chicago reporters that young congressmen should heed the advice of that legendary Speaker Sam Rayburn, who said, ' If you want to get along, go along. You 'll never get in trouble for a speech you did n't make. ' @!Cong-GUTIERREZ : Washington. Where 's Washington? @(Footage-of-Gutierr) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) What Luis learned was that congressmen with seniority are sensitive types who never forget a slight, especially when it comes time to hand out plum committee assignments. He suspected they 'd bury him on the Agriculture Committee. He ended up on the Banking Committee. @!Cong-GUTIERREZ : But let me suggest to you I 'm not on the Banking Committee because it was a committee I wish to serve on. I 'm on the Banking Committee because there were five empty slots they could n't fill. @(Footage-of-Congres) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) None of this comes as any surprise to Minnesota Congressman Tim Penny, a fellow Democrat who 's quitting in frustration after six terms on the Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idealism. Congressman TIM PENNY( Democrat, Minnesota) : This year we had 110 freshmen legislators and they were thwarted throughout the year every time they tried to exert themselves and bring about a change in the way this sy -- this system operates. @!SAFER : What you 're saying sounds like the leadership, or the older hands, see as their main job, when a freshman class comes in, is to -- to knock the stuffing, knock the idealism... @!Cong-PENNY : Make sure that they do n't... @!SAFER :... out of them. @!Cong-PENNY : Sure. @(Footage-of-Safer-a) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) So who are the culprits? @!Cong-PENNY : You -- you want to use the word ' culprits, ' huh? That 's the kind of story this is going to be? @(Footage-of-a-commi) @!Cong-PENNY :( Voiceover) The -- the key committee chairmen, John Dingell, Dan Rostenkowski, Bill Ford, you name it. The way it works is that those who are in key positions of power use that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are intimidated by that. @!Cong-GUTIERREZ : I mean, I have heard many times, ' Luis, do n't vote against this bill. ' And I say, ' Why not? ' And their answer is n't the merits of the bill, their answer is, ' Because chairman so-and-so of such-and-such a committee wants it passed, Luis, and you do n't want to cross him. ' I get that all of the time. @(Footage-of-a-NAFTA) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) The education of Luis Gutierrez was well under way when along came President Clinton and NAFTA, which Luis was leaning against. He started getting phone calls from his fundraisers. @!Cong-GUTIERREZ : There was, ' Luis, how you doing, buddy? How 's everything going? ' ' Fine, sir. ' ' Luis, we need you to vote for the North American Free Trade Agreement. I 'd like you to vote for it. It 's important. The president needs you. ' ' Well, you know, I 'm having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm calling to tell you about my difficulty. I 'm having a -- difficulty in raising money for your next fundraiser, and it 'd be a lot easier for me to make the phone calls and to be there for you, because people love you, Luis, do n't take me wrong, they really believe in you. But this -- you 'd be amazed how many people are saying to me, I just ca n't help Luis unless he votes. ' And if you think and if anybody thinks that there was n't an orchestrated, organized, coordinated effort on behalf of the White House and political operatives there to talk to your key fundraisers, then you 're living in another world. People understand that in order to get elected to Congress, it costs a lot of money. @(Footage-of-Washing) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) Washington can be a dazzling place to a freshman congressman, and the threat of not returning to these temples because of lack of campaign funds can have a powerful effect. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!Cong-GUTIERREZ : I remember getting the call from the White House. ' The president would like to speak to you. ' I know what it 's like to get a call from the White House : ' The president would like to speak to you. ' I mean, what do you do? Say, ' Go blow, I 've already made up my mind ; I 'm voting against NAFTA so I 'm not talking to you '? Is that a compromise? Is that bending a little bit? Maybe. But I do n't think you say that to the president of the United States. @!SAFER : So you spoke to him. @!Cong-GUTIERREZ : So -- of course I did. I -- I -- and then -- I did that. @!SAFER : So did you get in trouble for voting against NAFTA? @!Cong-GUTIERREZ : Well, I mean, let 's put it this way : The invitation to the White House got canceled pretty quickly. @(Footage-of-Gutierr) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) Still, this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He tried to end free congressional parking at National Airport and failed. He wrote a bill to further limit the money congressmen could take from political action committees and he and others wanted to tamper with pork-barrel projects. @!Cong-GUTIERREZ : And I continue to do those things. But... @!SAFER : And how -- and where did it get you? @!Cong-GUTIERREZ : It did n't -- did n't get me very far. Was I naive enough to think that everything we said in the campaign was going to come to fruition once I got here and that I was going to be part of just this huge movement of change? OK, I admit I 'm guilty. But have I lost that? Have I lost my heart and my soul in the process? No. @(Footage-of-Washing) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) In his first year, Luis Gutierrez discovered that Washington is a seductive and dangerous place ; that in order to remain true to yourself, you must be very careful about the company you keep. @!Cong-GUTIERREZ : My mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language). ' Tell me with whom you walk and I 'll tell you who you are, ' right? Well, I mean, you know, I 'm walking with a group of people that people do n't think highly of. And so, of course, they say if he 's walking with them, then he 's one of them. @!SAFER : Congressman Luis Gutierrez has good reason to be concerned. Last month The Washington Post published a poll about what Americans think of Congress. The results? An approval rating of 29 percent.
