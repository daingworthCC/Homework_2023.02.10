4124441 @!MARTHA-RADDATZ# @(Off-camera) President Obama, then and now, talking about problems at the VA. Let 's bring in the Roundtable, former senior White House advisor, David Plouffe, Republican strategist Ana Navarro, GOP pollster and " Daily Beast " contributor Kristen Soltis Anderson and ABC 's Matthew Dowd. Welcome to everybody. Matt, I want to start with you. I know this is personal for you, your two brothers and your son are veterans. Did the President handle this correctly? @!MATTHEW-DOWD# @(Off-camera) Well, I thought throughout this that there is a quote by Dostoevsky that says, " the degree to civilization in our society can be judged by entering our prisons. " And I 'd like to update that. the degree of compassion in civilization in our society should be judged by how we deal with veterans and the folks that come back with injuries and from war in all of this. the President, he has good intentions. his intentions have been good. And he has done some improvements in all of this, but the way veterans are treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about it, the unemployment rate is higher than the national average among veterans. We have a health care problem, obviously, in the course of this investigation and now, we also have homeless. The number of veterans, the thousands of veterans that are homeless in this country. @!MATTHEW-DOWD# @(Off-camera) that if you look at this and take a broad perspective on this, you take a look at this first, the number one thing is, is we 've got to quit fighting long wars that seem without end. That 's what 's driving a huge part of this problem that we have here. We 've now been in a war longer than ten years, that 's driving this problem. The other thing is, is there are some things that the government does n't do well and efficiently. And one of those, as we have learned over the last 30, 40 years, the VA system has never been efficient and never been fully effective. @!MARTHA-RADDATZ# @(Off-camera) And that goes back a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President has handled this. It took him almost four weeks to come out and say anything really about this. Why and was that the wrong thing to do? @!DAVID-PLOUFFE# No, I do n't think so. members of the administration had spoke to this. I want to pick up on something Matt said, there have been a lot of improvements. I mean, the President talked about this a lot in ' 08. I was on the campaign trail with him. And if you look at the effort with the private sector to hire veterans... @!MARTHA-RADDATZ# @(Off-camera) And they keep talking about those improvements, but this is some... @!DAVID-PLOUFFE# But that 's the whole story. Right. @!MARTHA-RADDATZ# @(Off-camera) It 's not the whole story. There 's 40 people who allegedly died during, waiting for care. Now, the President, the other day, said he did n't know whether there was a link between that. The IG said maybe not. But should n't the President have been out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And what 's important now, because, you know, Martha, the whole story is important. If you look at satisfaction, by the way, of veterans of the VA, it 's high, ranked most... @!MARTHA-RADDATZ# @(Voiceover) Once they get in there. @!DAVID-PLOUFFE# Right. But in a lot of places, they are. So we have to look at what happened in Phoenix. If there are other places where this is happening, there 's going to be a thorough investigation. the question really is, do you have confidence in the leadership? Not just in terms of what happened previously, but to fix this going forward. But Matthew raises other broad points about how we treat veterans. One of the great things to see our private sector companies step up, working with the President and the first lady, they have hired almost one million veterans. This is what we need to do in this country. @!MARTHA-RADDATZ# @(Off-camera) Ana, should Shinseki resign? @!ANA-NAVARRO# Shinseki should resign or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Obama has of this is that there does n't seem to be any urgency and any action that 's being immediately taken and people are frustrated. This is not a scandal that involves political conspiracy, this is a scandal that touches all of us. You 're seeing Democrats come out and calling for Shinseki 's resignation. You 're seeing Democrats comes out and be critical. That 's a very difficult political problem for the President because he was a member of the Veteran Affairs Committee in the Senate, because he made it a big focus of the 2008 campaign, he knew there were problems. And when you take a look at it, it 's a problem of incompetence, it 's a problem of being asleep at the wheel. It 's a problem of lack of leadership and governance. So, yes, it 's a big problem that falls right on his lap. @!MARTHA-RADDATZ# @(Voiceover) Let me go to you first. Yeah, this ca n't just be where the President has words. there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is n't just some, you know, it 's a favorite Washington game. Something goes wrong, somebody 's, you know, heads have to roll in order to make it all right. And this is a sort of a structural problem within the VA that is insuring that incentives are misaligned so people believe that making secret wait lists is okay and is the right thing to do. I mean, structurally, what reforms can you make to the VA to insure that this happens again? And that goes far beyond just sort of a musical chairs of personnel in Washington. @!MARTHA-RADDATZ# @(Off-camera) John Boehner floated the idea of privatizing the VA. Is that an option, do you think? @!MATTHEW-DOWD# @(Off-camera) Well, what they have to do is they have to have some better hybrid thing. Obviously, veterans, there 's specific injuries, and the reason why the VA was created, ' cause there 's specific injuries that can only be dealt with specifically by certain types of health care. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to wait in line. And my brother, my older brother, who was in the Coast Guard for 22 years, he actually likes the service he gets when he goes to the VA. @!MARTHA-RADDATZ# @(Off-camera) Which is what I was saying to David. @!MATTHEW-DOWD# @(Off-camera) The problem is, he has to wait too long to get in. @!ANA-NAVARRO# There was a very interesting piece in the " New York Times " yesterday by the whistleblower in this case, Sam Foote, a doctor who worked at the VA for 24 years and that 's precisely what he 's recommending, a hybrid type of system. And that 's who I would like, by the way, to be involved in an investigation of the VA, the guy who has been writing letters for years and not the same VA itself. @!MARTHA-RADDATZ# @(Voiceover) Is the people who actually worked, very quickly. @!DAVID-PLOUFFE# First of all, and the VA is using data and technology, they clearly could use more. There ought to be a dashboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, everything that 's happening through the whole system. But listen, there 's no doubt, most people would agree the VA needs more funding, given all the people coming out of these wars. This Republican Congress wo n't fund that. They 'll fund tax breaks for oil companies. They wo n't fund our veterans. @!MARTHA-RADDATZ# @(Off-camera) This also seems a problem with... @!ANA-NAVARRO# David, you know it 's a political problem when you 've lost Charlie Crist. @!MARTHA-RADDATZ# @(Off-camera) Okay, we 're gon na have to wrap this up. @!ANA-NAVARRO# That guy does n't read anything other than polls. @!MARTHA-RADDATZ# @(Off-camera) Okay, thanks to you all. But before we go to our break, our Powerhouse Puzzler. Check out one of our favorite moments from George 's " GMA " interview this week with Angelina Jolie. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Back in 2005, you spent a day in Washington. I asked you then if you would ever think about going into politics. You said, no, no, I have way too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my skeletons are out. They 're probably all out. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Well, that 's what I... @!ANGELINA-JOLIE# I do n't know if I have any left. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) You know, it 's almost ten years later, can you reconsider now? @!ANGELINA-JOLIE# You know, if I thought I 'd be effective, I would. But I 'm not sure if I would ever be taken seriously in that way and be able to be effective. @!MARTHA-RADDATZ# @(Voiceover) So, we do n't know if Angelina will run, but we do know her father, Jon Voigt, played a senator in a 2004 film. So name that film. Back in two minutes to see if the Roundtable, and you, can guess the answer. @!MARTHA-RADDATZ# @(Off-camera) What was the name of the film where Jon Vought played a senator? Let 's see what you gave up with. @!DAVID-PLOUFFE# One of the Batman movies. @!MARTHA-RADDATZ# @(Off-camera) Oh, sure, yeah. @!ANA-NAVARRO# He played Patrick Lehy... @!DAVID-PLOUFFE# Right. @!MATTHEW-DOWD# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It has nothing to do with this question. " Sum of All Fears "? @!MARTHA-RADDATZ# @(Off-camera) In other words, they do n't know. The answer, the remake of " The Manchurian Candidate. " @!MARTHA-RADDATZ# @(Voiceover) Back in two minutes. For 5 1/2 years, the powers that be in Washington have treated the people of this state with contempt. And tonight, I have a simple message for all of them, those days are numbered. Yeah, oh, you 're going to get it, Washington powers that be. I feel sorry for whatever jerk has represented Kentucky for these past 30 years. If Mitch McConnell catches a sight of that guy in, say, a mirror, it 's on. @!MARTHA-RADDATZ# @(Off-camera) Stephen Colbert having a little fun with the Mitch McConnell victory this week. And we are back with the Roundtable. And, Ana, I want to start with you and read you one of your fellow Roundtablers, what he tweeted this week after Tuesday 's primary results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the World Series, but changed the game with moneyball. Tea Party might have lost some elections, but have changed the GOP. " Would you agree with that? Did they change the GOP? @!ANA-NAVARRO# Of course, you know, you lose me completely with baseball metaphors. it has been a painful growing process, but this has been a very good week for the Republican Party, because we are bringing candidates out of the primaries that are actually electable. @!ANA-NAVARRO# The Democrats are going to have to have a much tougher time beating folks who are not Todd Akin, who are not Murdoch, who are actually seasoned veteran candidates, who can put on very able general campaigns. @!MARTHA-RADDATZ# @(Off-camera) Okay, Matt, explain your tweet, the baseball metaphor, for, you know, maybe some people. @!MATTHEW-DOWD# @(Off-camera) Well, sure. The metaphor is, is that, basically, you can win by losing. The Oakland As ended up losing the championship series, but actually ended up winning because most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the Tea Party, the GOP in general, has moved more to the right and has adopted the principles. There 's really not much difference anymore between Tea Party people and the establishment people. They have almost become one. it 's... @!ANA-NAVARRO# Oh, Matt, tell that to the Tea Party. Listen. This has been, you know, two very different... @!MATTHEW-DOWD# @(Off-camera) The Tea Party that 's sitting in this city in the halls of power? @!ANA-NAVARRO# This has been two very different factions going at each other. @!MATTHEW-DOWD# @(Off-camera) Who are now one faction, who are now one faction. @!ANA-NAVARRO# And for a very long time, the mainstream Republicans just sat there and took the pummeling. What we saw this week, was that they woke up finally, they fought back and when they fought back, they won. There is no doubt... @!DAVID-PLOUFFE# Well, let me say this. I do n't get the celebration. I mean, okay. Maybe it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it. It just got harder for you. @!DAVID-PLOUFFE# No, they 're not witches and, wait, wait, so they 're not witches and defenders of rape. Okay. So maybe they do n't pledge allegiance to all the crazy, but let 's look at these candidates. And let 's look at 2016. Different electorate, battleground states, all against immigration reform, all denying climate change, all against gay marriage, all against funding things like education and transportation of jobs. This is not people that are going to win, you know, the middle of the electorate or the emerging parts of the electorate. So Matt makes a very good point. The entire... Wait. You said 2016?( unintelligible) @!DAVID-PLOUFFE# Yes. Well, @!ANA-NAVARRO# Rick Perry, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio... @!MARTHA-RADDATZ# @(Off-camera) Okay. You guys argue amongst yourselves. Yeah, what 's been most exciting about these last few elections is that, a lot of lessons were clearly learned, that you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And if you want to win the US Senate, if you want to pick up enough seats to take that majority, which is what Republicans are laser focused on this year, you ca n't just take for granted that you 're going to win seats. So in states where the seat is winnable, potentially in, say, Oregon, we 've put up a safe candidate that 's going to make for an exciting race come November. In a state like Nebraska, that 's kind of a safe Republican seat, you 've got an exciting sort of Tea Party candidate who came out, who may well become a rising star within the party, in Ben Sasse. So whether it 's the Tea Party or the establishment candidates, a lot of good has come out of the last( unintelligible). @!MARTHA-RADDATZ# @(Off-camera) Let 's go to the House race everyone was watching this week and it was Pennsylvania 's 13th district, where Chelsea Clinton 's mother-in-law, Marjorie Margolies, ran and lost, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton even held a fundraiser on her behalf, Margolies behalf. @!MARTHA-RADDATZ# @(Off-camera) What happened there and what does this tell us? @!DAVID-PLOUFFE# Well, they helped out of, you know, family obligation. You have to help the mother-in-law. that, you know, she represented that district 20 years ago, so a lot 's changed. And this was a very strong Democratic candidate, a young candidate who won the race. I do n't think it says anything about Clinton coattails at all. I just think it was the dynamics in that district. @!MARTHA-RADDATZ# @(Off-camera) And, Matt, I want you, very quickly ' cause we have to move along here, to talk about President Obama tapping Julian Castro to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development. What does that say or 2016? @!MATTHEW-DOWD# @(Off-camera) Well, first of all, what the... @!MARTHA-RADDATZ# @(Voiceover) No first of alls. @!MATTHEW-DOWD# @(Off-camera) Okay, I do n't understand why Julian Castro would do it. It 's like when you go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term, usually nothing good happens out of it. I do n't think he 's going to be benefitted by it. @!MATTHEW-DOWD# @(Voiceover) And I also do n't think, if you look at the VA and we want a manager, I do n't necessarily think you pick Julian Castro to manage the agency when he does n't even manage the city of San Antonio. @!ANA-NAVARRO# He did it because he 's at the end of the road in Texas. I mean, let 's, you know, I like Julian Castro a lot, both brothers are terrific. @!MATTHEW-DOWD# @(Off-camera) But this is, when you go into a cabinet position, it 's not the end of the road. It 's over the cliff. @!ANA-NAVARRO# Right. But he has got nowhere to go in Texas. He could go blue in the face waiting for it to turn blue for him to win statewide. @!MARTHA-RADDATZ# @(Off-camera) Ana, I 'm just going to have to throw my pen at you at some point. Thanks all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chairman Martin Dempsey. Plus, on this Memorial Day weekend, an emotional reunion of one incredible band of brothers in our " Sunday Spotlight. "
