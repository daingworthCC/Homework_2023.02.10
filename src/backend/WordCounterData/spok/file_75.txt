232741 " A CHRISTMAS CAROL " @!KURALT : We are used to seeing Martha Teichner in London, but look, here she is, with us. Welcome home. @!MARTHA-TEICHNER : Thank you. Good morning. @!KURALT : Good morning. " A Christmas Carol " -- that story our grandparents used to read us, and we used to hear Lionel Barrymore perform at this time of year ; I suppose it 's the most popular Christmas story of the last couple of hundred years. @!TEICHNER : Ever, ever. In fact, he wrote it -- he got the idea after he had made a couple of appearances promoting social causes, as he did. But the real reason he did it was to make money, of all things. @!KURALT : That 's a traditional reason. @!TEICHNER : Yeah, right. He thought he was going to make a thousand pounds because he had relatives who were asking him for money. In fact, he made 230, because he was so specific and careful in the production of the book that it cost that much. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in publication, 6,000 copies. In the first -- in -- in the 1840s, even by today 's standard, that 's a substantial number of books. qwq @( Photos-of- " A-Chris Unidentified Man 1 :( Voiceover) Marley was dead to begin with, as dead as a doornail.

Man 2 :( Voiceover) Marley 's face -- it was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as Marley used to look, with ghostly spectacles turned up against its ghostly forehead. @(Excerpts-from-vari) @!TEICHNER :( Voiceover) It is this atmosphere of 19th-century England actors have tried to capture in hundreds of renditions ever since. Unidentified Man 3 :( Voiceover) Merry christmas, uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voiceover) Bah, humbug! Man 3 :( Voiceover) Christmas a humbug, uncle? You do n't mean that. @!TEICHNER :( Voiceover) " A Christmas Carol " was published 150 years ago today. During the 1840s, it outsold the Bible and was recognized instantly as the classic it remains, in spite of changing tastes. @!Mr-ROBERTSON-DAVIE :( Voiceover) Well, you can imagine what modern critics would say if this book were to appear, what the newspaper critics would say. They 'd be down on it like a ton of bricks. @!TEICHNER :( Voiceover) Noted novelist Robertson Davies is also a Dickens expert. qwq @( Visual ; - " A-Christm @!Mr-DAVIES :( Voiceover) It sins in every possible way. It 's stylistically messy and much too varied in what they call ' authorial ' tone. And it -- it just is n't written the way that people seem to want books to be written nowadays, and yet it 's just so much better than virtually all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @(Footage-of-Pierpon) @!TEICHNER :( Voiceover) The original manuscript is owned by the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York. Scrooge 's immortal line, ' Bah humbug ' started out somewhat less immortal : ' Merry Christmas, humbug. ' Even with changes, the book took only six weeks from page one to publication ; six tortured weeks, according to Dickens biographer Peter Ackroyd. @!Mr-PETER-ACKROYD-@ : He used to walk through the London streets at night unable to sleep, laughing, crying, until he was delivered of this particular tale. And you have to remember that he was only a 32-year-old man at the time he wrote this, still a very relatively young man. qwq @( Visual ; -painting-o @!TEICHNER :( Voiceover) The parallels with Dickens ' own life are evident, even in an American version of the story. qwq @( Excerpt-from- " A-Ch @!TEICHNER :( Voiceover) When Dickens was 12, he was taken out of school and forced to work in a factory. His father was sent to debtor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was rich. @!Mr-ACKROYD : The mainsprings of this little fable are to do with Dickens confronting himself, confronting his own Scrooge-like propensities, confronting the history which created that Scrooge-like propensity within him and trying, in a sense, to redeem himself. qwq @( Photos-of- " A-Chris @!TEICHNER :( Voiceover) Redemption has already begun for Scrooge during his time with the ghost of Christmas present. The classic Scrooge was Alastair Sim. qwq @( Excerpt-from- " A-Ch qwq @( Visual ; -British-Ch @!TEICHNER :( Voiceover) This year, Scrooge and the other characters in " A Christmas Carol " are on Britain 's Christmas stamps, drawn by children 's book illustrator Quentin Blake. qwq @( Footage ; -Quentin-B @!Mr-QUENTIN-BLAKE-@ : You can see that he 's crouched over, and his hands are gripped together as though he was holding onto money. @!TEICHNER : And -- and you see the -- the stinginess, the miserliness of the character. @!Mr-BLAKE : Yeah. Well, I hope so. I think the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the idea that -- that Dickens was able to create a kind of mythology of Christmas -- what are those things which we think of as -- as Christmassy -- as Christmassy things, but invented by him or brought into prominence by him. qwq @( Footage ; -storefron @!TEICHNER :( Voiceover) Dickens helped turn a previously rather dour religious event into the festive celebration of eating and drinking and gift-giving Christmas is today. @(Footage-of-Rochest) @!TEICHNER :( Voiceover) And nowhere is Dickens ' notion of Christmas more enthusiastically celebrated than the English town of Rochester in Kent. @(Footage-of-parade) @!TEICHNER : It just so happens that Charles Dickens loved the town of Rochester and spent the last 14 years of his life living in the vicinity. Today the Dickens connection has become something of an obsession here. @(Footage-of-Dickens) @!TEICHNER :( Voiceover) Dickens ' home, Gad 's Hill, is now a school, where everybody dresses up in 19th century costume.
