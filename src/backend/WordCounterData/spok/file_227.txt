MICHAEL STRAHAN( ABC NEWS) @(Off-camera) Everything you wanted for( inaudible)? KATE HUDSON( " DEEPWATER HORIZON ") Yeah. MICHAEL STRAHAN( ABC NEWS) @(Off-camera) Everything... KATE HUDSON( " DEEPWATER HORIZON ") Well, you know, it 's, she 's, like, she, like, pirouettes everywhere and, like, it 's the best. She 's still pirouetting everywhere, but, but, you know, when you 're a kid, I, you know, you 're sort of your parents, when they 're wild, you 're, like, oh... @!LARA-SPENCER# @(Off-camera) Yeah. KATE HUDSON( " DEEPWATER HORIZON ")... and Ryder 's kind of like that with me now, too so, you know. I get it. I get being scared of( inaudible). @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) This is the first movie, " Deepwater Horizon, " where you get to work with your pop, Kurt Russell. @!LARA-SPENCER# @(Off-camera) Oh, right. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ") Yeah, that 's right. Yeah. @!LARA-SPENCER# @(Voiceover) So, again with the theme take your parents to work day. I do n't know if that was sort of equal but what was that like? KATE HUDSON( " DEEPWATER HORIZON ") That was cool. You know, what I really, really loved about being on set with, we did n't have many scenes together in the film, but what I loved about being on set with him was, it was a reminder of me, of where I fell in love with making movies. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS# @(Voiceover) Mmm. KATE HUDSON( " DEEPWATER HORIZON ") And watching him, you know, it 's a very different experience when you 're watching a movie being made than watching the movie because it 's horribly boring. I mean, it 's just a, being on set is, oh, I love that picture, but it 's really boring. And, an, and, but for me as a kid, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it and, and I loved watching Kurt because he 's such a phenomenal actor and he 's, he 's... @!LARA-SPENCER# @(Voiceover) Aw. KATE HUDSON( " DEEPWATER HORIZON ") Yeah. And, but he would put so much care and effort into his roles and in a way that is, is, is different than of a lot of young people that I 've worked with, you know? It 's just a different mentality. @!LARA-SPENCER# @(Off-camera) Yeah, total master class at home. KATE HUDSON( " DEEPWATER HORIZON ") Kind of, yeah. @!LARA-SPENCER# @(Off-camera) But let 's talk about you because you, as Mark Wahlberg said, you 're that sort of emotional heart of, of this film. Of " Deepwater Horizon. " KATE HUDSON( " DEEPWATER HORIZON ") You know, Felicia, in this film I play, I play Mark 's wife Felicia Williams and she - really the character represents all of the families on the " Deepwater " who were left in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their families, not knowing, not having any idea if they were gon na come home. And( inaudible), I literally get the chills every time I talk about it because it, what, you know, I got, you got to be on set with these people and you get to talk about this experience that was incredibly traumatic and you, you realize what, like, what Felicia said. She said one minute felt like, felt like an eternity and... @!ROBIN-ROBERTS# @(Voiceover) And she was on set with you? KATE HUDSON( " DEEPWATER HORIZON ") She was on set with us sometimes, yeah. I got to talk to her a lot. She 's a wonderful, very strong woman. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS# @(Voiceover) I love that scene. KATE HUDSON( " DEEPWATER HORIZON ") And, yeah. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS# @(Voiceover) Well, let 's, let 's show people a, a bit of this. This is when your character, Felicia, gets some really bad news. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " DEEPWATER HORIZON " KATE HUDSON( " DEEPWATER HORIZON ") Natalie, this is Felicia Williams. Our husbands work on the " Deepwater Horizon " together. Well, I just called the Coast Guard and they can just confirm that there 's a fire but I just was wondering if maybe you heard something. @!ACTOR# What did the Coast Guard say? KATE HUDSON( " DEEPWATER HORIZON ") Just that there 's been a fire. @!ACTOR# Shelly heard people were jumping off the rig. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS# @(Voiceover) Oh, gosh. I was telling... KATE HUDSON( " DEEPWATER HORIZON ") I ca n't watch it. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS# @(Off-camera)... I, I know. I know. You ca n't. KATE HUDSON( " DEEPWATER HORIZON ") I ca n't watch it. It 's very hard. Yeah. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS# @(Off-camera) There 's a lot of people that are like that. And for people who are not familiar with the story, yes, it was this horrible, horrible environmental disaster and that, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a footnote to the story. And this, these families were so appreciative of you and Mark and the whole cast for bringing their story... KATE HUDSON( " DEEPWATER HORIZON ") Uh-huh. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS# @(Off-camera)... and letting people know how it impacted them. KATE HUDSON( " DEEPWATER HORIZON ") Yeah, it was really wonderful to be in New Orleans and have the premiere. We did a premiere in New Orleans where nine of the 11 families were there and you really felt it. You know, we, we, we felt it and we knew it when we were doing it. We just, you have this sort of extra added thing in the back of your head going, you know, the families are gon na see this movie. So, you really want to be careful and, and you, you, there 's no, there 's no carelessness going into making a film like that when you know the families are watching and, and, and then when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just sort of have this moment to kind of pay, it just a, it 's just, it sort of feels like, a, a, you know, a, a - a sort of memoriam, @!ROBIN-ROBERTS# @(Off-camera) Yeah. KATE HUDSON( " DEEPWATER HORIZON ") Or a, you know, to, to these, these people who really saved each other. You know, a lot of, there were some real heroes on that rig. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS# @(Off-camera) Yes. KATE HUDSON( " DEEPWATER HORIZON ") It 's, it 's, it 's a, it 's surprising that more did not die because they were so there for each other. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS# @(Off-camera) And when you watch the film, you 're, you 're thinking, oh, my gosh. I mean, it 's tragic that 11 lost their lives but so many more could have and Mark 's character who he, he portrays and, and( inaudible). KATE HUDSON( " DEEPWATER HORIZON ") I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rig... MICHAEL STRAHAN( ABC NEWS) @(Voiceover) Mike. KATE HUDSON( " DEEPWATER HORIZON ")... Mike Williams, but, you know, the thing that is, what Pete did that 's really amazing about this movie, because, you know, I read the script, I know the story and then I watched the movie and I was completely engaged, which is - which is rare when you 're making movies and Pete did this amazing job of sort of, you feel like you 're in, it 's, it 's... MICHAEL STRAHAN( ABC NEWS) @(Off-camera) In the middle of it. KATE HUDSON( " DEEPWATER HORIZON ")... it 's full on, you know? @!ROBIN-ROBERTS# @(Off-camera) Yeah. KATE HUDSON( " DEEPWATER HORIZON ") You, you 're in the, and it 's just, it 's almost like you feel this anxiety, like, people will really get an experience... @!ROBIN-ROBERTS# @(Off-camera) I know.
