238441 BOB EDWARDS, Host : In the Chicago suburb of Rosemont earlier this month police set up checkpoints at the entrances to residential neighborhoods. All visitors are required to stop, have their license plates videotaped, and announce where they are going. While there are growing numbers of gated subdivisions across the country, planning experts say they believe this is the first place in which municipal police control access to all of the single-family homes in an entire town. From Chicago, NPR 's Edward Lifson reports. EDWARD LIFSON, Reporter : Watch out when you 're driving into Rosemont. You may get caught in the very same gates they 've set up to protect you. POLICE OFFICER : warning driver Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Ho! EDWARD LIFSON : The gate comes crashing down on that guy 's windshield. POLICE OFFICER : Damn it, Joe! 2nd POLICE OFFICER : Stop crying. EDWARD LIFSON : There was no damage done. Rosemont 's population is about 4,000, mostly white middle-class people. Rosemont borders Chicago and O'Hare Airport. All of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by two sides by expressways, and on a third by the Sioux Line Railroad tracks. So the only three entrances were off of Higgins Road sp to begin with. Now the town has closed off one of those and put 24-hour-a-day guard houses at the remaining two entrances, manned by the local police. 3rd POLICE OFFICER : addressing driver How may I help you? DRIVER : Hi, I 'm here to see Brad Morris sp. 3rd POLICE OFFICER : OK @!DRIVER You know, I'm- I 'm so glad this was put up. 3rd POLICE OFFICER : It 's great, is n't it? DRIVER : It 's going to stop all the crime. 3rd POLICE OFFICER : All right @!DRIVER Thank you very much for putting it up. 3rd POLICE OFFICER : Excellent. Thank you. EDWARD LIFSON : The officer at the gate of Josepha Sebastian Williams sp, and with him today is Lieutenant Joseph Peterson sp. Peterson 's the village spokesperson on the guard house issue. He also lives in the residential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gate his property values will go up and his insurance rates will go down. Lt. JOSEPH PETERSON, Chicago Police Department : As a- as a responsible adult in this world right now you should be in favor of any protective measures that are here to protect you in the community that you're- that you 're in, and this is- this is one of them, and- and why would n't you want to cooperate with- 3rd POLICE OFFICER : addressing driver Good morning, how may I help you? Lt. JOSEPH PETERSON : -something of this nature? EDWARD LIFSON : But first-year medical Chris Edwards has a problem with the gates around his town. CHRIS EDWARDS, Rosemont Village Resident : Yes, I have a question. I thought that these gates here were n't supposed to interfere with our privacy? Lt. JOSEPH PETERSON : I do n't believe that they are, but- CHRIS EDWARDS : Then why was- when my brother and his girlfriend tried to enter the village two nights ago, why was he detained, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lt. JOSEPH PETERSON : I do n't know what you 're talking about, but if you 'd like to pull over there I 'd be happy to discuss it with you. CHRIS EDWARDS : I 'd appreciate that, sir. car pulls over EDWARD LIFSON : For Edwards it 's an issue of personal freedom. CHRIS EDWARDS : My complaint is when they got to the guard house and they were stopped, the guard tapped on the window, she rolled it down, he said, ' Where are you going? ' And she said, ' Well, I do n't think it 's any of your business, ' and, according to you, they 're supposed to let them through. Lt. JOSEPH PETERSON : Correct. CHRIS EDWARDS : But instead they were detained, they called five squad cars in, they surrounded them, and you can say- Lt. JOSEPH PETERSON : Are you done? CHRIS EDWARDS : You could say- Lt. JOSEPH PETERSON : Are you done? CHRIS EDWARDS : -that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PETERSON : Are you done? CHRIS EDWARDS : Yeah. Lt. JOSEPH PETERSON : OK. I was not there, you were not there. Your brother already called the police department to complain about something and he was advised how to go ahead and handle it. CHRIS EDWARDS : Right. Lt. JOSEPH PETERSON : So anything we say here is meaningless. CHRIS EDWARDS : OK. Lt. JOSEPH PETERSON : All right? So you go ahead and tell the gentleman your complaints about the guard house and he 'll go and poll other people- CHRIS EDWARDS : That 's fine, but it 's going to happen again. Lt. JOSEPH PETERSON : -and it 'll be a done deal. EDWARD LIFSON : One need not walk far from the guard house to find other residents who feel affronted by the police presence. Right across the street, a man who only gave his first name, Rich, says that the birds are singing, the town 's fountains are playing lightly over the duck pond, the hedges are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely. And then- RICH, Rosemont Village Resident : Guard towers. Pillboxes. Oh, it 's a beautiful sight to see those orange cones there and the gates at Checkpoint Charlie. I feel like I 'm a prisoner. Now the village may say that, ' Oh, hey, no intrusion on the village. We can keep the crooks out, the criminals out, the unwanted out, whoever they may be, but who 's to say six months from now, or- or a year from now, or- EDWARD LIFSON : ' Or we could continue with a few crimes per year, like we had for the last 10 years, ' says Rosemont Village attorney Peter Rosenthal sp. But most residents do n't want that, he says. He says that a year ago the village conducted a poll. One hundred and eighteen respondents said yes, they wanted the guard houses ; only 19 said no. So the village board decided to allocate $150,000 per year for two policemen to man the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this district, to most people who live there the occasional home burglary that would occur, the few bikes that were stolen, and the zero-to-five car thefts per year were too many. PETER ROSENTHAL, Attorney for Rosemont Village : You know, somebody comes home and their car is not in the driveway anymore, they 're concerned about crime. Everyone talks about the crime problem, and the elected officials of the Village of Rosemont have chosen to do something about it. EDWARD LIFSON : The seniors in town, such as Paulina Caputo sp, seem to love the guard house. PAULINA CAPUTO, Rosemont Village Resident : See, I got 29 grandchildren, and I like my grandchildren be safe in Rosemont, oh yeah. Nice. Beautiful. EDWARD LIFSON : But many of the seniors, even those who regretfully admit that the checkpoints are necessary, say that the fence that went up at the same time to close off the entire town makes them feel as if they 're in a cemetery. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her yard. She 's lived here 32 years and gets her late husband 's Rosemont police pension. That 's why she did n't want to give her last name. If she criticized the guard houses she was afraid that could jeopardize that monthly check. But Elsie wants to talk about the issue. She objects so strongly to checkpoints that she 's thinking of moving, and today she wonders why she 's bothering to plant perennials. The guard house makes her feel cut off from the real world. ELSIE, Rosemont Village Resident : It 's going to limit our children 's growth, it 's going to limit the potential that we have for having friends who are minorities, who are friends, who are perhaps seen as, you know, outsiders. It 's going to keep- it 's going to keep your friends from wanting to come to visit. EDWARD LIFSON : Some residents say they might mount a petition drive to have the guard houses removed. Elsie says that if every well-off community tries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating lots of angry have-nots outside the gates @!ELSIE There 's always that challenge, ' Well, if they have this fence there 's got to be some way to get over it. There 's got to be some reason that there 's a fence there. What are they trying to keep us from seeing? What are they trying to protect? You know, how can I get over this? How can I get around it? ' If the fence is n't there, the challenge does n't exist. So, you know, you may be defeating the purpose. EDWARD LIFSON : Before leaving Rosemont I go back to the guard house to have one last conversation with Lieutenant Peterson. Lt. JOSEPH PETERSON : I ca n't even imagine what this world 's going to be like in another 15 years, and every year that we go on more and more crazy things happen that would have never happened 15 or 20 or 25 years ago. So I guess maybe we did lose our innocence and- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of freedom, but I guess a little more restrictiveness that 's going to happen. EDWARD LIFSON : In Chicago, I 'm Edward Lifson reporting. POLICE OFFICER : stopping car at gate Hold it! Lt. JOSEPH PETERSON : Hi, how are you doing? POLICE OFFICER : How are you doing? DRIVER : Sorry about that. POLICE OFFICER : That 's OK @!DRIVER I 'm going to babysit my grandchildren- POLICE OFFICER : OK. Lt. JOSEPH PETERSON : Have a nice day. POLICE OFFICER : Have a nice day @!DRIVER -at Dott sp and whatever the hell it is. POLICE OFFICER : No problem @!DRIVER Thank you. Lt. JOSEPH PETERSON : All right..
