4103841 @!JIM-AXELROD-CBS-N: Tonight, escape in China. A blind dissident under house arrest eludes his guards and reportedly heads into the U.S. embassy. Celia Hatton reports from Beijing. Manhunt, police corner an armed survivalist. Terrell Brown follows the trail to his bunker. Jobs for Americans. Dean Reynolds visits with workers who settle for lower wages instead of none at all. And spy story -- does this re-enactment solve the case of the dead British spy? Charlie D'Agata with the bizarre details. Good evening. I 'm Jim Axelrod. We begin tonight with reports of a blind Chinese dissident make a 300-mile journey from house arrest to the gates of the U.S. embassy in Beijing. His as-yet-unconfirmed presence at the embassy would likely complicate U.S. relations with China just as Secretary of State Clinton is set to travel there. Celia Hatton is in Beijing. @!CELIA-HATTON-CBS-: The U.S. embassy in Beijing could be protecting this man, Chen Guangchang, one of China 's most famous human rights activists. Chen fled house arrest last week. Neither the U.S. nor the Chinese government will confirm he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chen is a self-taught defense lawyer. He was imprisoned after exposing a program forcing women to undergo abortions to conform to China 's one-child policy. But Chen 's real nightmare started after his release from prison. To keep him silent, authorities kept the outspoken lawyer under house arrest, along with his wife and six-year-old daughter. Security forces barred visitors and subjected Chen and his wife to regular beatings. After plotting for months, Chen made his great escape last Sunday. Under the cover of darkness, the blind 40-year-old lawyer waited until the guards were changing shifts. He then scaled a high wall and made his way to meet an accomplice. From the village in Shandong, a network activist helped him elude police 300 miles to Beijing. Now he 's trying to save his family. Yesterday, Chen released an internet video detailing the abuse they 've suffered at the hands of plains clothes police pleading to China 's premier to make it stop. In one instance, more than a dozen men broke into my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smothered her with a blanket, and brutally hit her with fists and feet for several hours, he says. They beat me, too. Chen said he does not want to leave China. U.S. and Chinese officials are believed to be negotiating the terms of his safe release, a decision that could affect the country 's fragile relationship. @!KENNETH-G-LIEBERTH: It is better for Mr. Chen is the U.S. takes a very, very low public profile on this and works quietly behind the scenes to get him out of China and to get his family out of China. @!HATTON: Well before the daring escape, the Obama administration had been focused on Chen Guangchang 's case. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton mentioned him in a speech on Chinese human rights last November. @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!HATTON: Secretary Clinton begins talks here in five days, so this development may well headline her visit -- Jim. @!AXELROD: Celia Hatton in Beijing for us. Thank you. So what does this mean for U.S.-China relations? We 're joined by former undersecretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no shortage of topics for Secretary Clinton to take up with Chinese leaders when she travels there. How likely is this to elevate human rights on the agenda? @!PROFESSOR-NICHOLAS: Jim, I think human rights will be on the top of the agenda given the story unfolding about Chen Guangchang. There were lot of issues to discuss, of course, Iran and North Korea and Syria and the global economy, but this is a dramatic story. If in fact this young man is in American custody, it will dominate the meeting. And the Chinese and American governments will have to try to work out a resolution of this very important matter. @!AXELROD: I guess the question then becomes how does Secretary Clinton raise the issue? Is it done forcefully and publicly, or is it done behind the scenes? @!BURNS: Well, you see today, Jim, that the two governments are not even acknowledging that he is in custody, and they 're not saying much. That means that they 're probably talking about it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disagreement, but I think this disagreement can only work out in one way. This young man needs to have freedom, either in China or the United States or elsewhere in the world. I believe the administration will stand up for him, safeguard his rights. And if he is in the American embassy, that 's considered American territory, and I think he 'll stay there as long as he needs to, to secure his freedom. @!AXELROD: Nicholas Burns, former undersecretary of state, thanks for joining us. @!BURNS: Thank you. @!AXELROD: A week-long manhunt is over in Washington State. Today, Peter Keller, a heavily armed survivalist, suspected of killing his wife and daughter apparently took his own life after authorities tracked him to an elaborate homemade bunker. More now from Terrell Brown. @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!TERRELL-BROWN-CBS: Last Sunday, firefighters responded to a house fire. Inside were the bodies of Peter Keller 's wife and daughter, both allegedly shot in the head by Keller as they slept. After the murders, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and handguns made his way into an elaborate 20-foot- long, multilevel doomsday bunker eight years in the making. King County Sheriff Steve Strachan said the search for Keller left tactical teams dehydrated and exhausted. @!STEVE-STRACHAN-SH: The terrain and elevation to where this was located is really extraordinary. @!BROWN: Detectives, working from a picture taken in 2004 from a hard drive in Keller 's home, were able to narrow their search for the bunker. With no nearby roads, a police helicopter airlifted chainsaws and supplies to break into the bunker yesterday. Tear gas rendered no response. But this morning, when police blew the roof off of Keller 's bunker, they found his body. @!STRACHAN: They believe the person has been dead for some time. There 's a great deal of blood and a pistol nearby. And they do believe that this is Peter Keller. @!BROWN: Court documents say Keller turned off his cell phone and withdrew $6,200 from his bank account. A witness tells police Keller was preparing for the end of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!AXELROD: Now to the economy and Detroit where roughly 2,000 people showed up at a job fair at the headquarters of " Quicken Loans. " The online mortgage lender is looking to add 1,000 new positions, saying the market has, quote, " really turned. " Even some jobs moved overseas are now heading home, but as Dean Reynolds reports, they come with a high cost. @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!DEAN-REYNOLDS-CBS: With the assembly line humming at GE 's massive appliance park in Louisville, Kentucky these days, it 's hard to imagine that the place was once headed for closure. @!DIRK-BOWMAN-PLANT: The water heat cert first new product in this place for 50 years. @!REYNOLDS: GE had shipped much of its appliance production overseas, relying on cheap labor to bring down costs. China was a lucrative source, but now, in the aftermath of the great recession, the American worker is more willing to accept lower wages to get a job. @(on-camera) : I 'm guessing you did n't have, like, a whole array @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: Well, I put in the applications, but, no, not really. @!REYNOLDS: New hires here in Louisville are making 38 percent below what they would have made, say, seven years ago, $13 an hour instead of $21. The company calls it a competitive wage scale. The union calls it a necessity. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: I felt like I 'd done my membership justice by helping bringing jobs back here. @!REYNOLDS: Jerry Carney is head of the local union. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: This country is in a reset. I have to get the jobs back in here, make appliance parts profitable and then get the higher wages back in here and try to fight to get them there. @!REYNOLDS: All of this comes as higher wages in China are making offshoring less attractive. Hal Sergan is managing director for the Boston Consulting Group, which studies American manufacturing. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: Wages are rising somewhere between 15 percent to 20 percent a year in China and over time that will make China far more expensive. @!REYNOLDS: G.E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is transforming the American assembly line by cutting out waste. @!BOWMAN: In China, they might have 15 hours of labor, we do it for three. So we 're extremely productive. @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL: If we can get these jobs back here in the states, you know, I 'm willing to do whatever it takes. @!REYNOLDS: GE says it will bring 11 new products to the U.S. and create 1,300 jobs by 2013. It 's the first trickle of what some economists believe could form a new wave of work returning to these shores. Dean Reynolds, CBS News, Louisville. @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!AXELROD: The Detroit Tigers said today outfielder Delman Young wo n't play again until undergoing an alcohol and anger management evaluation. Young was arrested Friday in New York on a hate crime harassment charge. Police say he yelled anti-Semitic slurs after getting into a fight outside the team 's hotel. Drug abuse is now the number one cause of accidental death, according to the federal government. Today, across the country, officials took steps to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey, the pill bottles were dropped off by the dozen. Responding to the call from the drug enforcement administration, people dumped their unused prescriptions at 5,000 locations around the country. @!GIL-KERLIKOWSKE-D: One of the things that we 've seen is that the people that misuse and abuse these prescription drugs. The first time that they do, they get it from a family or friend. That means it 's coming right out of somebody 's medicine cabinet. @!AXELROD: More Americans die from drug-induced deaths than any other accidental cause or injury, 39,000 in 2009, more than from car crashes, or from gunshots. Abby Boxman lives with the tragedy of prescription drug abuse every day. Her middle son, Justin, became addicted to the opiod pain reliever OxyContin during his freshman year in college. Once an outgoing athlete, he became withdrawn. @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL: When I looked into his eyes, there was just an emptiness there. It was n't him. It was -- he totally changed. @!AXELROD: Justin hacked his mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Eventually, he turned to heroin, which was cheaper than the pills. Nine months ago, he overdosed and died. @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL: He all these dreams, all these expectations of what he wanted out of life. He just wanted to get himself better. @!AXELROD: Abby started a chapter of grass, grief recovery after a substance passing and sees disposing of unused prescriptions as one step toward preventing a repeat of what happened to Justin. @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL: I truly believe in my heart that if he never tried a pill, those pills that he would still be here today. I really do. @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!AXELROD: The federal government says prescription drug abuse is responsible for 15,000 deaths a year. That 's more than the number of deaths caused by cocaine and heroin abuse combined. Still to come, the spy who died in a bag in his own bath tub. Can the government subpoena your tweets? And a new low point in relations between the U.S. and Pakistan. Those stories when the CBS EVENING NEWS continues. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader Osama Bin Laden at his hideout in Pakistan, U.S.-Pakistan relations are cratering. Whit Johnson is watching developments from Washington tonight. Whit, good evening. @!WHIT-JOHNSON-CBS-: Jim, good evening to you. The latest high-level talks to repair that battered relationship between the U.S. and Pakistan failed after two days, putting more strain on the Afghan war effort. @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: Pakistan has a very important role to play in bringing peace to Afghanistan. @!JOHNSON-@1voice-ov: U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Mark Grossman, left Islamabad with no agreement to reopen crucial cross-border supply routes. The routes have been closed since last November, when NATO airstrikes killed 24 Pakistani soldiers at a remote outpost. Pakistan has demanded a formal apology. The Obama administration has refused. Angered by militant groups operating from Pakistan, launching repeated attacks in Afghanistan, like those on April 15 in Kabul and NATO targets in three provinces. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. @!VICTORIA-NULAND-S: This is the beginning of the reengagement conversation. We 're going to have to work through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!JOHNSON: If there has been progress it 's been in America 's war on al Qaeda, nearly a year after the killing of Osama Bin Laden. Senior counter- terrorism officials tell CBS News the number of al Qaeda fighters in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region and in Iraq is in the low hundreds. But activity has picked up in Yemen, home to al Qaeda and the Arabian Peninsula, which may number several thousand. With the anniversary of the Bin Laden 's death on Tuesday, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta is making no apologies. @!LEON-PANETTA-SECR: The one thing all of us feel pretty good about that were involved in this operation is that as a result of what we did, America is safer. @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!JOHNSON: And with that anniversary approaching, counter-terrorism officials say that they are monitoring jihadist web sites for talk of possible attacks. So far, the White House says, there are no signs that any are in the works -- Jim. @!AXELROD: Whit Johnson at the White House, thank you. The crackdown continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeping into the city of Douma, just two days after the arrival of U.N. observers. The Assad regime is condemning U.N. Secretary-General Banki Moon for saying the government is to blame for repeated ceasefire violations. They are symbols of Iraq 's insecurity and division, but today Iraqi 's security forces began demolishing concrete blast walls in Baghdad. They were first put up after the 2003 invasion and multiplied at the height of the country 's sectarian violence. Still ahead, he helped occupy the Brooklyn bridge. Now the D.A. has subpoenaed his tweets. That story is next. @!AXELROD: A powerful spring storm with strong winds swept across the St. Louis area late this afternoon. The storm knocked down a party tent at a downtown bar, killing one person and injuring as many as 100 others. Five people are reported in critical condition. Facebook and Twitter are now essential tools for protest movements like " Occupy Wall Street. " Nine in 10 law enforcement agencies say they monitor social media. And Tony Guida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases against demonstrators. @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: If you refuse to leave you will be placed under arrest. @!TONY-GUIDA-CBS-NE: When occupy wall street occupied the Brooklyn bridge last October, police arrested 732 protesters, virtually all charged with disorderly conduct, neither a crime nor a misdemeanor, but a violation like loitering. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: There 's a whole lot of fuss over a politicized traffic ticket. @!GUIDA: The 23-year-old Malcolm Harris was among those arrested, but one of a handful whose Twitter account was subpoenaed. The DA maintains that Harris ' public tweets proved his intent to defy police orders to disperse. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: It 's a fishing expedition, and they 're going fishing for whatever information they can dredge up, whatever will make this harder on the people who are going out there protesting. @!GUIDA: Harris ' lawyer, Martin Stolar, says the subpoena of tweets in a case that is not even a crime is much ado about nothing. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE: We 're sitting here with a subpoena smashing a nut with a sledge hammer, and it 's absurd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement that it is authorized to make your tweets available to the rest of the world. He ruled that the tweets the defendant posted were not his, and, therefore, he has no standing to challenge their subpoena. Harris plans to keep up his fight. @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!GUIDA: Twitter remains a major organizational tool for the " Occupy Wall Street " movement. Its power figures to be on display again next Tuesday when a huge mayday rally is planned for this park. Tony Guida, CBS News, New York. @!AXELROD: There 's been a surge in children detained crossing on their own from Mexico into the U.S., and that 's straining the system to care for them. This week, authorities in Texas used empty barracks at Lack Land Air Force Base to house dozens of kids. The number of undocumented minors landing in U.S. custody is up 93 percent in the Past six months. Still ahead, death in a duffel bag. The mysterious case of the deceased British spy. That story is next. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest of spy writers. How did a British intelligence agent ends up dead in a zipped up duffle bag in his very own bath tub? Charlie D'Agata tells us investigators are now trying to solve this riddle. @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!CHARLIE-D'AGATA-C: Here is what you 're looking at, a re-enactment. This man is trying to stuff himself into a gym bag in a bath tub to determine if a British spy found naked and dead in one had padlocked himself in. The idea that Gareth Williams stuffed himself into a bag and died of suffocation is just the beginning of a real-life spy mystery that gets more bizarre by the day. Back in august 2010, the 31-year-old fitness fanatic and rising star failed to show at work at the British spy agency MI6. Strangely, his colleagues did n't report him missing for a full we week. Family members insist he was assassinated at his London apartment because of his undercover counter-terrorism work. MI6 officials said some of that included close contact with American agencies and visits to the U.S. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of a sex act gone wrong. He was a bachelor with no close personal relationships, yet, an orange wig and $30,000 of women 's designer shoes and clothes were found in his apartment. Experts said Harry Houdini would have struggled to climb in the gym bag and padlock it shut. But if he did n't stuff himself in, who did, and did he suffocate inside the bag or was he killed and then stuffed in the bag? The inquest is scheduled to wrap up this week but with no suspects, no witnesses, no motive, and so few clues, it has raised more questions than it has answered. Charlie D'Agata, CBS News, London. @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!AXELROD: And that is the CBS EVENING NEWS. Later on CBS, did a motivational speaker conspire in his own murder? That 's tonight 's " 48 Hours Mystery " at 10 p.m., 9:00 Central. For everyone here at CBS News, I 'm Jim Axelrod in New York. Good night.
