228541 CONNIE @!CHUNG : You know, a bee sting can kill you. But some people think you can live longer and better -- that is, if you 're a victim of one particular incurable disease. Russ Mitchell found the ancient art of bee venom therapy is giving thousands hope. Russ. @!RUSS-MITCHELL : Connie, in this high-tech medical era, it 's hard to imagine that an old folk remedy that some claim cures everything from the flu to headaches would be generating so much excitement. But the people who are excited are also desperate. @!BEE-LINE-# qwq @( Footage-of-a-house Unidentified Man 1 : Ready, set... Unidentified Woman 1 : Ow! Unidentified Woman 2 : Relax. @!MITCHELL :( Voiceover) It 's been described as a cross between Lourdes... @!Ms-PAT-WAGNER-@1MS : They moved your toes. Hello, hello, hello. @!MITCHELL :( Voiceover)... and a Tupperware party. @!Ms-WAGER : How are you doing? Unidentified Man 2 : OK. @!MITCHELL :( Voiceover) Three mornings a week, they flock to this small house in suburban Washington, drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Unidentified Woman 3 : How did you finally find out that it was the MS? @!MITCHELL :( Voiceover) MS -- multiple sclerosis, the degenerative nerve disease for which there is no cure. @!Ms-WAGNER : Let 's do the spine -- do the low -- the low spine -- on the spine. @!MITCHELL :( Voiceover) For these MS victims, there is resignation, there is desperation -- but there is also hope, hope in the form of an unorthodox therapy... Unidentified Woman 4 : Ow! Unidentified Woman 5 : Ow! @!MITCHELL :( Voiceover)... hope in the sting of a honeybee. Unidentified Woman 6 : Ow! What did you do to that bee? @!MITCHELL :( Voiceover) Proponents of this therapy say bee venom boosts the immune system and works as an anti-inflammatory, easing the suffering of people with MS, arthritis and other ailments. Unidentified Woman 7 : Now which way should I face? @!Ms-WAGNER : Look over there. Look at -- look at Jane Terry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any allergies to the venom, these folks receive from two to 20 stings per session. Unidentified Woman 8 : Ouch. Unidentified Woman 9 : Ow. @!MITCHELL :( Voiceover) At the center of it all -- the queen bee, if you will -- is 42-year-old Pat Wagner. @!Ms-WAGNER : Do n't be sorry. That 's good that your leg 's moving. Unidentified Woman 10 : It is? @!Ms-WAGNER : Sure. @!MITCHELL :( Voiceover) Pat Wagner says she knows why people come here. She was diagnosed with MS in 1970. Conventional therapies were ineffective. @!Ms-WAGNER : Can you wiggle that foot? @!MITCHELL :( Voiceover) Only one year ago, Pat was in a wheelchair, her condition deteriorating rapidly. @(Footage-of-Mitchel) @!Ms-WAGNER : I could have cut my legs in half and not felt it. I had no bowel or bladder control. Let 's see, I was deaf in my right ear...( unintelligible). @!MITCHELL : And being stung by bees made it all better? Got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy -- fantastic energy. I was -- I just felt like within weeks I could run a Boston marathon. I mean, I still could n't walk. @(Footage-of-Stuart-) @!Dr-STUART-GOODMAN- : We 're going to take a look at a few things. @!MITCHELL :( Voiceover) Pat 's neurologist, Dr. Stuart Goodman, acknowledges his patient 's turnaround and credits the bee stings -- sort of. @!Dr-GOODMAN : She has shown significant improvement, and we can not discount the fact she has had these bee stings, which have corresponded with her improvement. @(Footage-of-Mitchel) @!MITCHELL : I have to ask you, who are you to tell these people, ' Come here, let me sting you with my bees, and I think you 'll feel better '? You 're not a medical expert. Who are you to tell these people that? @!Ms-WAGNER : But I am a victim of MS. I know what it 's like to live without feeling, without being able to wiggle a toe, without being able to hug your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know what it 's like to come back from there. @(Footage-from-Wagne) @!MITCHELL : Typically, you give her 20... @!Ms-WAGNER : Yeah. @!MITCHELL :... bee stings? @!Ms-WAGNER : Yeah, but -- Monday he gave me one. @!MITCHELL :( Voiceover) Pat Wagner continues to receive treatments, and she 's turned her living room into a kind of walk-in clinic, treating as many as 50 people in a single day. The charge? Nothing. @!Ms-WAGNER : Joyce, what 's the total count today? @!JOYCE : Thirty-two just came in the door. Unidentified Woman 11 : What 's it going to hurt? I mean, what can it hurt? It 's worth a shot, because the doctors certainly are n't giving us anything. @!MITCHELL : What do you think about this, Laurieann? @!Ms-LAURIEANN-GREEV : I think it 's fantastic. I think it 's absolutely fantastic. I mean, I 'm feeling so much better. qwq @( Photos-of-Greeves ; @!MITCHELL :( Voiceover) Laurieann Greeves is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagnosed with MS eight years ago. Slowed and depressed by her disease... @!Ms-WAGNER : You get 16? @!MITCHELL :( Voiceover)... she turned to bee stings last May. What 's it like being stung 18 times? @!Ms-GREEVES : Hurts like a son of gun, and I 'm being very nice! @!MITCHELL : Yes, you are. @!Mr-MIKE-GREEVES-@1 : I saw a change after the first session of bee stings. @!MITCHELL :( Voiceover) Laurieann 's husband, Mike. @!Mr-GREEVES :... swelling in her face -- it dropped immediately. Her speech came back. She 's -- as you can tell, she 's more perky, you know. @(Footage-of-Mitchel) @!MITCHELL : The concept of bee venom therapy has been around for centuries, but you can trace much of the recent buzz over this controversial treatment to this patch of land in Middlebury, Vermont -- to these 20 beehives, to an 89-year-old beekeeper named Charles Mraz. @(Footage-of-Mraz-wo) @!MITCHELL :( Voiceover) Stricken with rheumatic fever as a child, Mraz relieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 75 years ago. He 's been treating arthritics ever since. He began working with MS patients in 1986. @(Footage-of-Madelei) @!Ms-MADELEINE-TENNY : We started off slowly and I worked up to 20 stings each visit, three times a week. @!MITCHELL :( Voiceover) One of Charlie Mraz 's first MS patients was Madeleine Tenny. And after approximately two years of the bee venom therapy... @!Ms-TENNY : Right. @!MITCHELL :... you feel great? @!Ms-TENNY : Oh, yeah. @!MITCHELL : Do you feel you 're cured? @!Ms-TENNY : I do n't want to say that I 'm cured. I am symptom-free right now. I do everything that I ever did before. qwq @( Footage-from-Wagne Unidentified Woman 12 : She needs bees. Unidentified Woman 13 : I need bees. @!MITCHELL : Today? Woman 13 : Yes. @!MITCHELL :( Voiceover) But despite all the testimonials to the benefits of bee stings, the medical establishment remains unconvinced. @(Footage-of-Stephen) @!Dr-STEPHEN-REINGOL : Bee venom therapy is an unproven treatment for multiple sclerosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. @!Dr-REINGOLD : People may claim benefit, but it is only anecdote on an individual basis. We lack the clinical data to support a positive therapeutic claim for bee venom. @(Footage-of-Brad-We) @!Dr-BRAD-WEEKS-@1Am : They 're absolutely wrong. They 're absolutely wrong. They have n't done their research on this. @!MITCHELL : Vermont physician Dr. Brad Weeks heads the American Apitherapy Society, which studies the medicinal use of bee venom. They 've just begun keeping records on people receiving bee sting therapy. @!Dr-WEEKS : I think this is a winner. And I think that -- I 'm very sad that the societies like the MS Society and the Arthritis Foundation have n't taken this up because this is clearly, in my opinion, the most promising biologic that 's come around in decades. @(Footage-of-researc) @!MITCHELL :( Voiceover) But there 's another complicating factor. MS researchers, like Dr. John Richerts of Georgetown University, say people with the disease often see their symptoms disappear, return, and disappear again without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person with MS with a particular therapy and they get better, there 's no way to know whether that person got better because of that therapy, or whether they would have gotten better anyway, even if nothing had been done. @(Footage-of-Wagner) @!Ms-WAGNER : How could it be coincidental that all these people come here and get stung by me and go out of here feeling better? That 's an awful big coincidence. @!MITCHELL : If this stuff is so great, if these -- these bees are so great... @!Mr-CHARLES-MRAZ-@1 : Yeah. @!MITCHELL :... why has n't the medical community for the most part embraced this? I 'm asking. @!Mr-MRAZ : You poor, innocent little child. @!MITCHELL : Help me out, help me out. School me on this. Why has n't the medical community embraced this? @(Mraz-rubs-the-tips) @!MITCHELL : And that means... @!Mr-MRAZ : Money! There 's no money in bees. How in the hell are you going to make money with those things? They can't. @(Footage-of-the-Wag) @!MITCHELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, husband Ray runs out back to collect more bees, and Pat Wagner continues to believe that she is on to something big. Just what do you offer people who walk through that door? @!Ms-WAGNER : A smile, a hug, a kiss, hope. Everything 's OK. This is just the beginning. @(Footage-of-Chung-a) @!MITCHELL : Connie, it 's estimated some 10,000 Americans are currently undergoing bee venom therapy. We want to point out not everyone claims the same results. We talked to one woman who was stung 15 times every other day for almost a year. She told us she saw no improvement whatsoever. @!CHUNG : Thanks, Russ. When we come back, America 's newest obsession, and they 're trying to get you hooked. Home shopping : what 's in store. Do n't move.
