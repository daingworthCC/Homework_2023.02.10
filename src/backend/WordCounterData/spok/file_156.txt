4022241 @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) Good evening, I 'm Cynthia McFadden. There are an estimated five million adopted people in America. Tonight, the remarkable journey of one of them. Most people can take for granted that they 're someone from somewhere. The basic parameters of who they are and where they came from are clear. What medical issues run in the family. Where the curly hair comes from or the blue eyes. But for tens of thousands of adopted people, even the most basic facts remain shrouded in secrecy. Many choose not to search. That was how Cynthia Guditus, adopted in New York City, 43 years ago had always felt. She adored her family and felt no pull backwards, until she did. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) Everything changed for Cynthia Guditus when her 12-year-old son was diagnosed with cancer and his doctors told her it would be a good idea to search out her family 's biological history. @!PAM-SLATON-@1RESEA# Since we met last I 've been doing a little preliminary work. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) Her search led her to hire Pam Slaton. @!PAM-SLATON-@1RESEA# It 's something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) Another adoptee who has matched more than 2,500 people with their biological mothers. @!PAM-SLATON-@1RESEA# Some things you may be allowed to ask. Some things maybe can be considered non-identifying information. I want to know what region of the US she came from. Her occupation at the time, level of education. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) Today, Cynthia is headed to the Foundling Home, the place that handled her adoption 43 years ago. @!PAM-SLATON-@1RESEA# I 'm rooting for you, kiddo. Good luck. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) Pam will not be allowed inside. @!PAM-SLATON-@1RESEA# So are you excited? @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# I 'm excited. Very nervous. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) So it will up to Cynthia to gather whatever information she can. Wendy Freund is the director of New York Foundling. She knows the name of Cynthia 's biological mother, but is not legally permitted to reveal it. @!WENDY-FREUND-@1NEW# Your birth mother was referred to us by catholic charities. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) She can tell Cynthia non-identifying information. Her mother was catholic and met her father on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were saying before you wanted to be a teacher, which is really... @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# Yeah. That 's very funny. @!WENDY-FREUND-@1NEW# Is n't that something? @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# Yeah, it 's amazing, yeah. Was there any information on the birth father? @!WENDY-FREUND-@1NEW# The birth father we know was a swimming and diving instructor. @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# My mom always used to say you should be in the Olympics because I love to swim. @!WENDY-FREUND-@1NEW# Really? @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# Yeah. I really do. I 'm a very good - a very strong swimmer. @!WENDY-FREUND-@1NEW# So you 're a perfect genetic match of these two people. @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# That 's very funny. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) And then a tiny bit of emotional information about the mother she has never known. @!WENDY-FREUND-@1NEW# She gave signs of caring. She brought you from the hospital here. She did n't want to sign surrender until she knew you had a permanent home. She wanted to know that you were in a good home. She was private which is going to be one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how private did she stay about this? @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# Well, and that 's been my biggest concern from the beginning, is I do n't want to intrude on her life if she 's a private person. You know, I do n't want to walk in 43 years later and be like hi, you know. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) Before Cynthia goes, one more thing that is not in the file. @!WENDY-FREUND-@1NEW# Now, we might as well put on the table my big disagreement with Pam. We 're both right and we 're both wrong. I think that the gentlest way to approach someone is with a letter. Just a plain envelope, with a simple note, not too much, not too overwhelming. That she can think about and respond to. Pam personally for her, she likes the phone call. @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# Right. @!WENDY-FREUND-@1NEW# And my problem with a phone call is if she 's not alone in the room, it 's such... @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# I agree. @!WENDY-FREUND-@1NEW#... a shock. @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explode her world into a tailspin. @!WENDY-FREUND-@1NEW# I am here to see you through whatever this takes us. @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# Okay. Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) Pam is waiting for her, eager to hear what she 's found out. @!PAM-SLATON-@1RESEA# Do you know what she had told your father about you? @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# I do n't know. It does n't indicate that. @!PAM-SLATON-@1RESEA# And how did they meet? @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# Very casual it sounds like. @!PAM-SLATON-@1RESEA# All right. You ready for this? @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# I hope so. I think I am. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) When we come back, what Pam finds out. @!COMMERCIAL-BREAK-# @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) A recent survey suggests over 60% of Americans have some personal connection to the adoption issue. We continue now with one woman 's search for her birth mother. Cynthia Guditus has assembled all the fact she can on her own and hired a professional to help her find the biological mother she 's never known. But she treads lightly, knowing many lives will be affected by what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes a few minutes for Pam Slaton to solve the 43-year-old mystery. Using Cynthia 's birth certificate and the information Cynthia got from the Foundling Home, the answer. @!PAM-SLATON-@1RESEA# At this point I believe we 're looking at the information on the biological mother. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) Pam also believes she 's figured out where Cynthia 's birth mother lives and has found her phone number. Later that night, I 'm home sick with laryngitis, so they come over to my house to talk about what Pam has found. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) Tell me what happened today. I 'm so interested to know. What was it like, Cynthia? @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# It was very emotional. It was very emotional. And I really was n't expecting it. You know, it 's been a long journey. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) Did you sleep last night? @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# No, not very well. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) So can you tell her something right now? @!PAM-SLATON-@1RESEA# Well, I did find her birth mother for her and she 's alive, which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cynthia. @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# Yeah, my heart 's in my throat. Because it 's Pandora ' s Box. @!PAM-SLATON-@1RESEA# Well, from what I saw, she looks to be pretty stable. I mean she does n't look as though she 's moved a hundred times. @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# Oh, my god, I 'm just speechless. I 'm speechless. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) Cynthia has a name, but now what? Write a letter, make a call? Do nothing? @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) Do you want to call her? @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# Oh, my. I do. I just do n't want to - I mean what about if she has n't said anything. That 's my biggest thing. What about if she got married and never mentioned it and her children are there. You know, that 's my biggest concern. @!PAM-SLATON-@1RESEA# Well, when you do a phone call, if that 's the way you decide to go, you know, I was born on February 1, I 'm looking for my biological mother. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) Cynthia is full of questions, of worry. @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# I 'll tell you, I 'm a little concerned. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) I mean there are a lot of reasons. And I guess all of us have our own reasons for looking and not looking but I wonder - I know you 're close to your parents. @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# Yeah. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) Did you feel that to look would be disloyal to them in some way? @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# I did. I felt very much like I would be cheating on them almost. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) Like having an affair? @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# I did. I felt very like - and I really - we 're very close and we sat down and we just talked honestly. You know, I 've always known I was adopted as well as my younger brother. So our parents were always very honest about it. And I felt bad. The circumstances that brought us into was my son was sick and, you know, that it was kind of the catalyst, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were like, I ca n't imagine if I had a connection with somebody in the world and not knowing. You know, it 's only normal to be curious. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) She does n't want anyone to be hurt in her quest. Not her adoptive parents who she adores, not the woman who placed her for adoption. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) I hear you being much more concerned about your biological mother 's feelings than your own. And I want to say to you, but hold it a second, what about how you feel? Then I think, well but gosh, yes, I mean this is a woman who put you in a safe place, made sure you 'd be okay. @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# And loved me enough to make sure I went to a great family. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) It is an emotional conversation for both Cynthia and Pam and for me I too am adopted. @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# And that 's kind of the thing about being adopted is right, you can almost make your own history. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaining about that once. Well I do n't know. And a way to feel that you 're a part of everyone and have a connection to everybody is a good thing. On the other hand, not to know, I mean you 're not really. You are someone. From somewhere. @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# Right. @!PAM-SLATON-@1RESEA# It 's kind of a strange thing. I think finding your birth family is like a weird way of validating your existence. Because you kind of feel like, you know, my joke to my clients is, you know, you were n't dropped off from the mother ship. You came from somewhere. And it 's just like saying this is real. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) How are you going to make the decision about what to do next? @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# I do n't know. You know? I really want to call her. I really do. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) But first, Pam helped Cynthia practice for the call. @!PAM-SLATON-@1RESEA# I was adopted from the New York Foundling Home. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you help me with this? And then, you know, if I do n't know what you 're talking about, say okay, can I leave you my number? Because that 's clearly I ca n't talk. @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# All right. I guess I 'll... @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) Are you sure you 're up to this? @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# Yes, I 'm up to it. So if I start crying... @!PAM-SLATON-@1RESEA# You got the spiel down? @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# I 've got it down. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) When we come back, the call. @!COMMERCIAL-BREAK-# @!ANNOUNCER-# ' Nightline " continues from New York City with Cynthia McFadden. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) In just ten hours, Cynthia Guditus, a 43-year-old mother of three has gone from having no idea where she came from, to finding out the identity of her birth mother. She has decided to call her, but first, for the fourth time, she practices for the call she thought she would never make. @!PAM-SLATON-@1RESEA# Do you want me to dial it? And then see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want me to... @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# If a woman answers, just give it to me. And I 'll say hi, my name is Cynthia Guditus. @!PAM-SLATON-@1RESEA# I 'm going some - you can say I 'm doing some genealogy research. Can you talk right now? @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# Okay. @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# Genealogy research, write that down. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) I look on in utter disbelief. @!PAM-SLATON-@1RESEA# Hi, hang on one second, please. @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# My name is Cynthia Guditus. I 'm doing some genealogy research. I 'm sorry. My name is Cynthia Guditus. I 'm doing some genealogy research. I was just wondering if it 's a good time to talk or if I could give you my phone number if you 'd like to talk some time. Um, I was born February 1. I was adopted at the Foundling Home. I do n't want - I just wanted to ask if you could talk. I do n't want - you know, intrude on your life or anything. I could give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time. 631- - 631- - I really just wanted to call to thank you, because I 've had a wonderful life. I appreciate everything you 've done. Because I have the most wonderful family, and my son was diagnosed with cancer a couple of years ago and they suggested that I just try to find somebody with a biological link. So if - he 's fine now. And um, I know you have probably gone on with your life and that 's fine. But I just wanted to ask you because - I really appreciate that. I 'm sorry. I know this is such a shock and I did n't know how to do it. If I should write you a letter. I 'm sorry. Your husband could be there. If you need to - I 'm sorry. I would never tell anybody. I swear. I am a mother of three children. A very stable person. You know? This - you do n't have to explain it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank god for you, because you had choices. I did n't have to be. And you gave me life and I have had such wonderful parents. And I heard that you wanted to find out like, you know, I heard that you, you know, approved the parents and stuff like that. And I just - or anything like that. I just really - I just love you and it does n't matter if we ever meet. I just - do you? I pray for you too. And it 's fine. Please do n't feel that - I would never intrude on your life. You know, I would never, you know, do anything like tell your kids or anything like that. But I hope that you have a happy life. Thank you. I 'm sorry. I 'm so sorry. I really did n't mean to upset you. Oh, you 're 70? Oh, god bless you that 's great. Are you okay? Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever want to talk or if I can help you in any way, please, you have my number. I will not call you again. I will not contact you. Okay. That 's my cell phone number, so that 's not even my home number. So, you know - yeah. So, you know, you do n't have to talk to anybody, you know, my kids or anything like that. Can I ask you just a couple questions? Does cancer run at all in your side of the family? Later. Okay. All right. And breast cancer or anything like that? Well that 's great. Well, that 's good to hear. That makes me very happy. And I 'm sorry. I really did n't mean to upset you. I 'm sorry. It 's fine. It 's fine. If I can do anything to help you, you just let me know, okay? Okay. God bless you too. Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I 'll pray for you too. All right, bye, bye. Oh, my god. @!PAM-SLATON-@1RESEA# You were like the coolest chick. @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# Oh, my golly. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) Oh my god. @!PAM-SLATON-@1RESEA# Are you all right? @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# I 'm fine. I 'm like in shock. @!PAM-SLATON-@1RESEA# You did it. I am proud of you. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) You were amazing. Are you okay? @!PAM-SLATON-@1RESEA# You were. @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# She was very... @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) Was she crying, what was she saying? @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# She was in shock. She was in shock. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) How do you feel right this second? You were amazing. @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# I feel so good. I feel so light. I feel literally physically lighter. I wish it were true if I got on the scale, but I feel so good right now. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) Why, why? @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# I do n't know. Just hearing her voice and just hearing that she thinks of me. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) In the very beginning, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# No. She just said I 've never told anybody. @!PAM-SLATON-@1RESEA# Wow. So that was the knee jerk reaction. @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# She says I 've never told anybody. I never told my husband. And I never told children. And you know what? Back in that day, you did n't share this stuff. This was shameful. You know? I mean it 's so crazy that you know our society, we the women are like that, you know feel that way. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) Did she leave the door open at all? I mean you gave her the phone number. @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# I left the door open, and I told her to call me. It did n't sound like maybe right now this is something she can do. And that 's okay. @!PAM-SLATON-@1RESEA# You may be surprised. You never know. She 's going to check your boundaries and she 's gon na see if you 're going to be respectful of her. She might come forward. If she sees that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may come forward. You did such a good job. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) Oh, my gosh, you were amazing. You were so comforting to her. I mean, you know? What children want is to be comforted by their mother, and then yet, you were comforting her. It was really beautiful, I have to say. @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# That 's so sweet. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) No. It 's true. Did n't you feel that way? @!CYNTHIA-GUDITUS-@1# I do n't even know what I said. I should have wrote... @!PAM-SLATON-@1RESEA# You said... @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Voiceover) You never know when a day will come along that changes your life. Cynthia Guditus returned home to her family, her husband, her three kids, all of whom are now healthy, feeling blessed and at the same time, different. That was eight months ago. Cynthia tells us she has yet to receive a call from her biological mother, and worries that perhaps she has lost her number. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) But nonetheless, Cynthia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for letting us join her on this most intimate of journeys. @!CYNTHIA-MCFADDEN-@# @(Off-camera) When we come back, we ask you your opinion on our nation 's adoption laws.
