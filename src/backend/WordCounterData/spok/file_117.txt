238841 @!ALEX-CHADWICK-HOS : A new biography tells the story of scandal in the White House, but this is a scandal that would not need an independent counsel to uncover. Carl Sferrazza Anthony specializes in political history as seen from the vantage point of various presidential wives. His latest book tells the story of Florence Harding, first lady during the term of Warren Harding, from 1920 ' til his death in 1923. Carl Anthony joins us. Good morning. CARL SFERRAZZA ANTHONY, AUTHOR, " FLORENCE HARDING : THE FIRST LADY, THE JAZZ AGE, AND THE DEATH OF AMERICA 'S MOST SCANDALOUS PRESIDENT " : Good morning @!CHADWICK Three years, this man 's term is three years. It hardly seems you could squeeze so much tawdry behavior into such a short span of time. But throughout all this time, before he 's a politician, he 's womanizing and carrying on in the most reckless manner, and she 's there with him, I guess, accepting this @!ANTHONY That 's part of the story. His first relationship was with her best childhood friend. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florence, it was unspeakable in polite society. But the notion that it was a woman who was married -- actually she was separated from her husband -- somehow Florence was able to justify it. The second relationship and the great -- was with Harding the great love of his life, Carrie Fulton Phillips( ph), was Florence 's best adult friend. And that was a relationship of some 15 years, and that is a relationship chronicled here for the first time in the love letters and the erotic poetry and the secret code and the smoking gun of the blackmail @!CHADWICK In fact, there was a threat from this woman to expose the relationship she had with Warren Harding while he was campaigning for president. She 's paid blackmail by the Republican National Committee at the time to keep her quiet @!ANTHONY Twenty-five thousand dollars in a lump sum from the Republican National Committee. Here is a man who was about to be nominated for President of the United States, who is passively thinking about suicide, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no alternative but to get you nominated so we can get this money and keep her quiet. " CHADWICK : That 's an astounding story that you drive for the presidency, for the presidential nomination, in order to pay off a blackmailer @!ANTHONY And Carrie Phillips was finally sent out of the country by the Republican National Committee from the middle of the campaign until after the election. And then she came back again during the White House years and insisted that Harding appoint her brother and her son-in-law to federal posts, which he did. She even insisted that he appoint her husband as ambassador to Japan. And finally in the Senate, when word got around why this, you know, dry goods salesman from Marion, Ohio was being nominated for an ambassadorship, it was squelched. Frankly, all of these women that Harding was involved with, they were annoying, they were demanding, they were incessant in what they wanted from him, in a way that Florence really never was @!CHADWICK Harding is elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know, you might expect that this kind of behavior would stop. It does n't stop. He, in fact, is protected by the press. The publisher of The Washington Post becomes his very good friend and they carry on. Prohibition is on, but they 're having booze parties at the White House, running around with women. It 's astounding that the President of the United States could get away with this @!ANTHONY It 's equally astounding that members of the press were also indulging in this behavior. And so, in a sense, the president had them in check as well @!CHADWICK There 's so much in this story that we ca n't begin to account for. Suicides. Really awful money scandals that are going on that are infamous to this day. Through all this, Florence Harding is really carrying on quite a role as what we might think of as the first modern first lady. She embraces causes, building hospitals. She had quite a role in kind of seeing that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington and politics. She devises basic campaign strategies. She 's not really recognized today, though, as this kind of leading woman. What happened to Florence Harding 's reputation? ANTHONY : Harding died in August 1923, 75 years ago this August. Two months later, Congress begins investigations into the Teapot Dome and Veterans Bureau and Justice Department scandals. Florence 's return to Washington as a widow, burning correspondence and public documents which she feels incriminate the president. Six months after her death, her astrologer, Madame Marshak( ph), begins writing a series of tell-all memoirs, including publishing handwritten letters from Florence proving that in fact the Duchess was frequently consulting her for controlling the president 's appointments and his schedule and so forth to protect him @!CHADWICK " Duchess, " that 's her nickname? ANTHONY : Yes. Than Nan Britton writes her book in 1927, " The President 's Daughter, " revealing her relationship with Harding. Then, three years later, Gaston Means( ph) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow the president, writes a book in which he boldly states that the first lady poisoned the president. So her work on behalf of women, immigrant children, anti- vivisection, disabled veterans, Armenian relief, an incredible and rich progressive legacy of real work, real substance, real policy, is entirely forgotten and she becomes this caricature, the first lady who poisoned the president @!CHADWICK You reveal in the book that in fact she did not poison the president, he died of heart failure. Certainly a contribution was the fact that in part Mrs. Harding 's reliance on this quack doctor was a contributing factor. But when you think about Florence Harding now, how does she fit in in the range of first ladies you 've written about? ANTHONY : Florence Harding is really the first of the modern first ladies. She was the first to actually physically touch the public -- hug them, pat them on the back, kiss them -- in a way that the rather remote, Victorian women before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analogous to the things said about Princess Diana breaking from the way the royal family had treated the public. She was a progressive woman, and she really ranks among the activist first ladies, those who did address public issues and were willing to become involved in controversy @!CHADWICK Thanks very much @!ANTHONY Thank you very much @!CHADWICK Carl Sferrazza Anthony writes about first ladies. His new book is called " Florence Harding : The First Lady, the Jazz Age, and the Death of America 's Most Scandalous President. " #
