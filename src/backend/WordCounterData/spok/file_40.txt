225441 HARRY @!SMITH, co-host : Oscar nominee John Travolta 's just ahead in our next half-hour. And later on CBS THIS MORNING, live your winter dreams when Hattie Kauffman takes you on an Olympic fantasy camp. @!PAULA-ZAHN-co-hos : It is 16 minutes past the hour. We were at the White House yesterday, while in New Hampshire there was an onslaught of Republicans who 'd just love to move in. Needless to say, our presidential pundits are eager to let us know what they think about all this. Democratic analyst Bob Beckel 's in Washington this morning. Good morning, Bob. @!Mr-BOB-BECKEL-@1De : Good morning, Paula. @!ZAHN : And joining us from Dallas, Fred Barnes of The New Republic. Welcome, Fred, as well. @!Mr-FRED-BARNES-@1T : Good morning, Paula. Hi, Bob. @!Mr-BECKEL : Hey, Fred. @!ZAHN : So before we talk about New Hampshire, why do n't we talk about the Republicans almost being halfway through the -- the -- the 100-day mark of -- of the Contract with America? Bob, let 's talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far, a package of six anti-crime bills so far. The balanced budget amun -- amendment, among other things. What kind of start are they off to? @!Mr-BECKEL : Well, I -- listen, I 'm going to give them some credit. They 've done -- they 've done it quickly, but they 've also done the easier part of it. It 's not tough to vote for crime bills. It 's not tough to vote for a balanced budget amendment. But they have n't hit the tough stuff. They have n't said where they 're going to cut spending. As a matter of fact, they 're retreating so much, the most dangerous place in Washington is to be behind the Republicans. In the next week or so, it 's going to be very difficult. And, of course, the other problem is they 're in the Senate and they 're just stalled and bogged down. So -- but I 'll give them credit. They did a pretty good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going to be a nightmare for them. @!ZAHN : Well, Bo -- Fred, let 's talk for a moment about what -- what the House members are going to find them up against when -- when these measures end up in -- in the Senate and -- and the president, of course, has threatened to -- threatened to veto a large number of these measures. Then -- then how do they look? @!Mr-BARNES : Well, he 's threatened to veto a couple of measures, the crime bill and the foreign affairs bill, and -- and then Republicans may not get them enacted, but they 'll have an issue. I think they 're doing very well. I mean, after all, it 's Democrat Senator Bobby Byrd of West Virginia who 's stalling the balanced budget amendment in -- in the Senate. Republicans -- look, the public does n't expect the Republicans to enact all this. They expect them to enact some of it, but, in particular, they expect them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the next 50 days that John Kasich was talking about. I agree with Bob. This is the hard part. This is true test of Republicans. Are they going to ram through these spending cuts or not? @!ZAHN : Bob Beckel, you 're smirking as always. @!Mr-BECKEL : Well, I mean -- yeah. No, I 'm not -- no, Paula, Listen, I -- I listen to Kasich and I listen to Fred. @!Mr-BARNES : Yeah. Do n't smirk, Bob. @!Mr-BECKEL : The problem is they keep talking about this thing, this balanced budget by 2002, keep taking Social Security off. It is a great con job. It 's a shell game. They ca n't do it. But I 'll tell you one thing... @!Mr-BARNES : Of course, they can. @!Mr-BECKEL : I 'm glad they have to make these decisions and not Democrats in Congress. But we 'll wait and see. It 's their turn. @!Mr-BARNES : Well, Democrats had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't do it. You heard what... @!Mr-BECKEL : I do n't... @!Mr-BARNES :... John Kasich, the Republican Budget chairman, was saying. All they have to do is rather than increase spending over the next seven years, $ 3 trillion, just increase it $ 2 trillion. @!Mr-BECKEL : Were we really around 40 years? I guess that 's... @!ZAHN : Let 's move o -- on to the Dr. Henry Foster nomination. We were with the president on -- on Friday, and he says the nomination is not dead. He will stand by Foster. And if his colleagues in -- in Congress decide to -- to pummel the nomination, that 's their business. Bob, what 's going to happen in the end? @!Mr-BECKEL : Well, I think -- I think he does have an outside chance, but I 'll tell you, I go against conventional wisdom of -- of the Democrats. They think that Clinton stumbled into this fight and it 's good because it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defend pro-choice in Roe vs. Wade than it is to defend abortions. There 's a distinction. And when Foster gets up there, you 're going to see some of these pro-life senators begin to show pictures of fetuses in the -- the month when -- when Foster performed the abortion. The other big question is they 're going to ask him, ' Well, when does life begin? ' And, ' If you think abortions are so bad, why do you do it? ' As I say, it is not going to be as pretty a picture or as good politically as the Democrats think it may be. And I think that could be a problem all the way around. @!ZAHN : So, Fred, does that mean Dr. Henry Foster will not be our next surgeon general? @!Mr-BARNES : Well, that 's certainly what it means to me. I do n't think it will even come to a vote. Bill said he does n't want to have one. You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his administration, any administration that looks like America. Do you know mo -- how many pro-lifers there are in -- in the entire administration and in Washington? None. Not a single one. @!ZAHN : Bob? @!Mr-BECKEL : Well, I mean, you know, this -- the -- most pro-lifers are in Fred 's party. I think -- I get back to this point, though, I do n't think the idea is that -- that the Republicans own pro-life or the Democrats own pro-choice. Abortion is a very difficult struggle. You can see it up in New Hampshire. That 's not a segue into New Hampshire, although I want to talk about that. @!ZAHN : That 's where we 're going, though. @!Mr-BECKEL : But I 'm telling you, the Republican Party is more divided on this issue than the Democrats are. And you saw it already in New Hampshire, and it 's going to get uglier for Republicans more so than Democrats. @!ZAHN : You guys got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Hampshire so far. I ca n't believe we 're talking about New Hampshire this morning already... @!Mr-BECKEL : That 's amazing. @!ZAHN :... but, Fred, what do you think? @!Mr-BARNES : Bob loves this. He used to do this stuff for a bu -- his business, getting to New Hampshire a year before anybody was interested in it. Look, this is a fight for the activists and the party. The public 's paying attention to how the Contract with America is doing. @!Mr-BECKEL : Let me just -- let me say one thing. With these -- this crowd up there did in -- in one night was to do something the White House staff has not been able to do, which is to make Bill Clinton look very presidential. I mean, it -- with exception of Bob Dole, to borrow a baseball analogy, these are replacement players. I mean, come on. @!ZAHN : Phil Gramm? @!Mr-BECKEL : Phil Gramm, ET 's granddaddy. Alan Keyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? I do n't even -- see this. I was right. I was first one to point this out. @!ZAHN : Pat Buchanan uses that all the time. @!Mr-BECKEL : And I notice the two people up there -- Pat Buchanan uses it and I also understand some other president -- that was mine on this very show a year ago, so nobody can steal that baby. He is. @!ZAHN : Is your money on Bob Dole, Fred? We 've got three seconds left. @!Mr-BECKEL : Bob Dole. @!Mr-BARNES : I 'm sorry. Yeah, Dole is the front runner and he looks good. But Gramm 's driving the process. @!ZAHN : Ah. Twenty-three minutes past the hour. Be here in our next half-hour for John Travolta. @(Commercial-break) @!ZAHN : It is 25 minutes past the hour. And Bob Beckel 's still with us ; Fred Barnes is as well. Good morning again. Welcome back. @!Mr-BECKEL : Hi, guys. @!Mr-BARNES : Hi, Paula. @!SMITH : Fred, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dallas. @!SMITH : For? @!Mr-BARNES : Phil Gramm country here. @!SMITH : Yeah. @!Mr-BARNES : No, I was giving a speech. @!SMITH : Yeah. @!Mr-BECKEL : He 's -- he 's in Dallas to make money. What else does a Republican go to Dallas for? @!SMITH : No, no, no. Was n't it -- was n't -- did n't he have a big dinner? @!Mr-BARNES : No, the big dinner is Friday night. @!SMITH : Friday night. Coming up. @!Mr-BARNES : And it 's so big that they had to move to a big -- a new hall and he 's going to raise nearly $ 3 million. I mean, look, the reason this whole presidential process for the Republicans has started so early is because of Phil Gramm. The others look out there and see him organizing everywhere and raising money and -- and making 8,000 phone calls a day and they say, ' Wait a minute. We 've got to do it, too. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day, he 's got a card file on every single person he 's met over the last -- What? -- like five years or something? @!ZAHN : That 'll work. @!SMITH : He has 240,000 names on a list of people he sha -- shaken hands with. @!Mr-BECKEL : You know, we did that thing, you know, in the Mondale campaign. We did all this stuff early. We raised a lot of money. We had 50,000 names, and look what happened. We won one state, which is still suspect how we got those few votes. @!SMITH : But, see -- but, you see, Phil -- you know, Walter Mondale does n't have the personality Phil Gramm does. @!Mr-BECKEL : Hey, that is a che... @!ZAHN : Oh, you guys. @!Mr-BECKEL : Wait a minute. Wait a minute. @!ZAHN : Whoa! @!Mr-BECKEL : That is a cheap shot. That 's horrible. Personality? If this guy 's got a personality, man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. You 've got to be kidding me. @!ZAHN : Oh, no, it 's getting worse in here this morning. @!Mr-BECKEL : I used to live in Elizabeth. But -- no, but I go back to that thing. I think Dole -- look, every time Gramm looks like he 's doing lots of good things, raising money and investments and wins a straw poll and burns up a lot of money doing that, do you notice Bob Dole 's people are smart enough to do a statewide poll and release it, showing that Dole is the overwhelming favorite? I 'm very impressed with Dole so far. He may make some mistakes -- and Gramm 's already made some. Look, he already dumped on Souter up in New Hampshire, the Supreme Court justice. You make mistakes when you 're in a race this long. @!ZAHN : You know, I -- I... @!Mr-BARNES : You do but... @!ZAHN :... I 'm curious to -- well, go ahead, Fred. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the -- at the Carter White House and all the Democrats in 1980 saying, ' Look, the guy that did n't go in anywhere that we 'd love to have run against us is Ronald Reagan. ' They said they were afraid of Howard Baker. You know, sometimes the opposition gets these things wrong. @!ZAHN : To -- to what extent do you think these -- these Republican candidates will deploy their wives in the campaign? You know, the -- the wrap, of course, against Phil Gramm is that he 's basically been hiding his very talented, articulate, smart wife every time he 's run for election because Americans might not respond to her because she 's an Asian-American? @!Mr-BARNES : Oh, I do n't think that 's a fair charge at all. Come on, he had her when he spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference a week ago. She was there, she talked, he talked. I -- I think she 's going to be very prominent. One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to raise a lot of money in the Asian-American community. @!Mr-BECKEL : But I -- I would n't dismiss the fact that the Gramm people are sensitive about it. They brought her into the limelight here very slowly. I thought that performance of hers on " 60 Minutes " was good on Sunday night, but it told me something. She does n't have all the fervor for this race that he does. That 's pretty clear. And I -- I get back to my point : the longer the Republicans are out there running like this and beating up each other, the more potential there is for mistakes. And if I were Bob Dole, I 'd stay way away from it and left ET 's granddaddy do all the talking. @!SMITH : Fred -- Fred Barnes... @!Mr-BECKEL : Because, Fred, I 'm telling you, when this guys says, ' You know, I was conservative before conservative was cool, ' I do n't remember in my lifetime when conservative was n't cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drift, Bob? @!Mr-BECKEL : I mean, even you 're cool... @!Mr-BARNES : Bob, you do n't quite understand that line. @!Mr-BECKEL :... which is amazing. You 're cool. @!Mr-BARNES : I do n't think that was aimed at you. @!SMITH : Fred, Bob does n't get it. @!Mr-BARNES : He does n't get it. @!ZAHN : Have him read Doonesbury. @!Mr-BECKEL : Oh -- oh, ex -- excuse me, Bob, does n't -- I 'm sorry, Harry, I forgot you cut your roots. No, but, I mean, come on. It just -- it gets old. @!SMITH : We got to go. @!Mr-BECKEL : We got to go? We 'll see you. @!SMITH : Awfully nice to see you guys. @!Mr-BECKEL : You, too. @!Mr-BARNES : So long. @!Mr-BECKEL : Thanks a lot. @!SMITH : Have a lovely day. @!Mr-BECKEL : Paula, it 's nice to have you back safe and sound. @!ZAHN : Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
