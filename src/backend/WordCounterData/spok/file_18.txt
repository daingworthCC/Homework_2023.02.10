222541 DRESS FOR SUCCESS @!LESLEY-STAHL-co-h : In " My Fair Lady, " Henry Higgins bets a friend that he can take a common flower girl off the streets of London and pass her off as royalty. And he did, not only by teaching her how to speak, but just as important, how to dress. Our Henry Higgins is this woman, Nancy Lublin, who three years ago, at the ripe old age of 24, when she was in law school, unexpectedly received a $ 5,000 inheritance from her great-grandfather. She did n't use the money to buy something for herself, but instead, she used it to start a non-profit enterprise called Dress for Success, to help poor women get jobs. Her inspiration came from something her father told her when she was a child : That he could decide who to hire just from their appearance. Do you remember that having an impact on you? @!Ms-NANCY-LUBLIN-@1 : Yeah. I thought it was the most obnoxious thing I ever heard. And it was terrible. And he said, ' That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair. ' And so I probably pouted for a little bit, and then combed my hair. And -- and I just said, ' Well, then I 'm going to do something about it. ' And he said, ' Fine. ' @!STAHL : Well, what it sounds like is that you finally, having lived a little bit, came to think he was probably right. People do judge people. @!Ms-LUBLIN : They do. @(Footage-of-women-i) @!STAHL :( Voiceover) For instance, would you hire this woman in blue jeans, if she walked into your office looking for a job? How about this woman? Nancy 's idea is that the clothes may not make the woman, but they sure do seem to help. She started Dress for Success in the basement of a church in Greenwich Village in New York City, where poor women, women on welfare, women coming out of prison, are given an expensive suit with accessories, a new pair of shoes, and $ 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most important days of their lives : the day they land a job. The women who come here are sent by job training programs. The director of one of them, Amalia Betances, says job training alone is not enough. @!Ms-AMALIA-BETANCES : You have to look as if you 're ready to work. You have to be able to fit into the new environment that you 're going to be in. And so, for that reason, how they look is the last thing that helps them get over the line and get that job. @!STAHL : Just their clothes and their makeup and their hair is that important? @!Ms-BETANCES : It 's that important. @(Footage-of-Cheryl-) @!STAHL :( Voiceover) Cheryl Williams is a typical Dress for Success client. Convicted of selling drugs, she is a prisoner on work release. Cheryl spends her nights in a locked facility in Harlem, her days training for a job. And she was n't about to go for that job without first going to Dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit and having nice makeup on, does that really make a difference, do you think? @!Ms-CHERYL-WILLIAMS : It makes a lot of difference, ' cause I tried it without doing it, and it 's not that good. @!STAHL : Have you ever worn makeup before? @!Ms-WILLIAMS : No. @!STAHL : Never? Ever? @!Ms-WILLIAMS : I do n't like makeup. @!STAHL : Will you wear it, though? @!Ms-WILLIAMS : I will. If it makes a better impression on me, I will. @(Footage-of-William) @!STAHL :( Voiceover) Twenty minutes later, Cheryl had picked out her suit. Already, she was standing taller. @!Ms-WILLIAMS : I feel great. I feel like a new person, inside and out. @(Footage-of-William) @!STAHL :( Voiceover) Then the woman who did n't like makeup sat down for her first makeover. @!DIDI : OK. Relax your face a little bit. You 're getting a little tense there. @!Ms-WILLIAMS : Yeah. @!DIDI : Open up just a little bit. Just take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great, really. Honest. @!Ms-WILLIAMS : Mm-hmm. Drop-dead gorgeous! @(Footage-of-William) @!STAHL :( Voiceover) A little makeup, a new suit. In all her life, Cheryl Williams has never had this kind of attention. @!Ms-WILLIAMS : Hello, world. I 'm here! @!DIDI : All right! @!STAHL : Where do the suits come from? Are they all given to you by just people like me, who say, ' OK, I have this nice suit. I 'm not going to wear it anymore '? @!Ms-LUBLIN : You do have this nice suit. It 's a good jacket, you know. If you want to... @!STAHL : You want it, right? @!Ms-LUBLIN :... leave it with us. Sure, yeah. Most of them, I mean there are generous women who clean out their closets and maybe they lost 20 pounds, or they gained 20 pounds. And they give us their wardrobe. @!STAHL : Do they have to clean it? @!Ms-LUBLIN : It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that this is a suit that maybe once meant something to you, that is now going to mean something to someone else. Oh, that 's the one you said was hot. @!TEISHA : Yeah, this is OK. @!Ms-LUBLIN : That 's OK? Well, let 's keep trying. Now we want one where you get and put it on, you go, ' Ah, love it. ' @!TEISHA : OK. @(Footage-of-Lublin-) @!STAHL :( Voiceover) Nancy does n't want the women who come here to feel they 're receiving a handout. She refers to them as clients, and offers them the same kind of service anyone would expect to get at the most exclusive designer boutique. @!TEISHA : Oh, I do n't know which one I want now. @!Ms-LUBLIN : You 've got an Evan Piccone here, and a Jones New York there. They both fit you beautifully. You 're going to look great either way. @!TEISHA : OK, please let me think over here which one I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these women are -- have either been in prison, or are at -- still in prison. They 're homeless. They 've been battered. How much can a suit really make a difference, or a half-hour here of sort of ego massaging? What are you 're -- you 're denting layers of problems. @!Ms-LUBLIN : Absolutely. I mean, there -- there is so much going on with the women that we see, and they 're getting the counseling elsewhere, and they 're getting the restraining order against their abuser. They 're having help to find housing. @!STAHL : Children problems. @!Ms-LUBLIN : Children, child care. Huge problem. But -- you know -- but we want to focus on that woman herself. The restraining order 's focusing on the abuser, and the child care 's focusing on who 's taking care of the kids, and the housing is also for kind of her whole life, and that kind of thing. But we 're spending 30 minutes here on just one-on-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself. And I think that that is crucial. @(Footage-of-Lublin-) @!STAHL :( Voiceover) To support Dress for Success, Nancy raises money from corporations and foundations, part of which goes to pay for her salary. @!Ms-LUBLIN : Your shoulders should fit more like that. @(Footage-of-Lublin-) @!STAHL :( Voiceover) Nancy dresses about 1,000 women a year, and to help, she has recruited a small army of volunteers, they call them ' personal shoppers, ' who spend a few hours a week here advising... Unidentified Personal Shopper 1 : It could look nice just pulled back a little. @(Footage-of-persona) @!STAHL :( Voiceover)... mixing and matching, oohing and aahing. Unidentified Personal Shopper 2 : Oh, God, that 's so great! @(Footage-of-Stahl-w) @!STAHL :( Voiceover) To come here, a woman must have an interview already set up. Sharon Alderman is applying for a position with banking giant Salomon Smith Barney. She 's raising four children on her own, and has n't held a job in 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes, I am. I 'm on welfare right now. @!STAHL : How long? @!Ms-ALDERMAN : About six or seven years. @!STAHL : What 's that like? What does that do to you? @!Ms-ALDERMAN : It becomes a crutch after a while, because you feel that, you know, you ca n't do anything else. @!STAHL : Your interview is in a couple of weeks. @!Ms-ALDERMAN : Right. @!STAHL : Are you intimidated? @!Ms-ALDERMAN : Oh, you know I am. You know I am. @!STAHL : So that day, nervous? @!Ms-ALDERMAN : Very. Very, very, very, very, very. But I 'm not going to let that stop me. @(Footage-of-Alderma) @!STAHL :( Voiceover) Sharon has been studying accounting and word processing for months at a job program called Wildcat. How do you think you 're going to feel in your new suit? @!Ms-ALDERMAN : I -- I think that I 'm going to feel like I 've probably been -- that -- that I belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just coming in from public assistance, but I have been working with Smith Barney for a while now, and I belong. That 's what I 'm going to feel. @!Ms-LUBLIN : That is beautiful. @!Ms-ALDERMAN : This is me. @!Ms-LUBLIN : That 's you. @!Ms-ALDERMAN : This is me. @!Ms-LUBLIN : This double-breasted jacket is really terrific on you. @!Ms-ALDERMAN : I know. I know. @!Ms-LUBLIN : That 's great. This is a whole new look. @!STAHL : To me, it was like shopping in Saks or Bergdorf-Goodman, with the saleswomen around telling you how great you look in that. That 's you. As if -- it was almost -- almost like a cliche. @!Ms-BETANCES : Yeah. Is n't that nice, though? Is n't -- because they show our women right from the beginning that they 're worth something and that they can be beautiful, that they can look just so good. And one of the things that I 've been very impressed with Dress for Success is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @(Footage-of-Alderma) @!STAHL :( Voiceover) The day Sharon visited Dress for Success was a special day set aside each week for larger-sized women. @!Ms-LUBLIN : We call them our thumbs-up women, because they do n't look like pinkies, they look like thumbs. And the thumb means you know, good luck, go for it, congratulations. So, we call that day Thumbs-up Day. @(Footage-of-Alderma) @!STAHL :( Voiceover) But most of the suits and shoes are donated by women who are not ' thumbs-up ' women, so Thumbs-up Day creates special problems. @!Ms-LUBLIN : They 're beautiful brand-new leather shoes, and I 'm really hoping they 're going to fit. Want to try on the shoes? @!TEISHA : They do n't fit. Too narrow. @!Ms-LUBLIN :( Unintelligible). Too narrow? @!TEISHA : Mm-hmm. @!Ms-LUBLIN : We have a tough time in the larger sizes. And also the transformation there is that much more dramatic when they put a suit on. And it 's less likely that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them, they feel even more special. And it just breaks my heart when we do n't have something or we do n't have something of quality. @(Footage-of-Lublin-) @!STAHL :( Voiceover) In order to avoid that, Nancy spent the previous day on the phone asking corporations for donations, then visited a store for large women that had contributed clothing in the past. @!Ms-LUBLIN : Thanks so much for letting me run up here like this. I beg. @!STAHL : You do? @!Ms-LUBLIN : Yeah, sure. Definitely. I 'm not too proud to beg. @!Terrific-You're-th# Unidentified Store Owner : Well, I 'm happy to do it. @!Ms-LUBLIN : Well, thank you. @(Footage-of-Priscil) @!STAHL :( Voiceover) And that begging paid off when Priscilla showed up needing a size 28. @!Ms-LUBLIN : Oh, wow. @!STAHL : It was a perfect fit. You know, I saw you come in here in your blue jeans. I would not recognize you. You came in here... @!PRISCILLA : Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady. " You 're Henry Higgins. @!Ms-LUBLIN : I guess so. I guess so. @!STAHL : You are. You 're transforming. You 're re-molding, you 're re-sculpting. @!Ms-LUBLIN : Though, I 'll tell you, it 's not Henry Higgins, though, because he -- that was a bet, was n't it? And he -- and he was trying to change the way they spoke. I 'm just trying to get them to a point where they can feel like they have options and choices and chances to do whatever they want to do. I do n't have -- there 's no prescription here. Beautiful on you. @(Footage-of-Alderma) @!STAHL :( Voiceover) Sharon Alderman 's 30 minutes of being pampered and perfected is coming to an end. Let 's get the whole outfit. Unidentified Woman 1 : Wow! Unidentified Woman 2 : You got the job! @!Ms-ALDERMAN : Oh, thank you! That 's what I want. @!Ms-LUBLIN : OK. @(Footage-of-Lublin-) @!STAHL :( Voiceover) Since Nancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened up in 31 other cities in the country, and she 's making plans for it to go worldwide. Remember Cheryl Williams? We caught up with her as she left prison the morning of her job interview wearing her new suit, a new hairdo, and makeup. @!Ms-WILLIAMS : I feel great. @!STAHL : Yeah? @!Ms-WILLIAMS : Yeah. And I 'm eager and anxious to see my outcome from my interview. I feel real beautiful, like a nice young lady 's supposed to feel, just going out looking for work. @(Footage-of-William) @!STAHL :( Voiceover) Later in the day, we learned that Cheryl did not get the job. Well, what happens when a woman comes here? She has this massaging, and it 's wonderful. And she is transformed by the time she leaves. And the next day she goes for her interview, and she does n't get the job? @!Ms-LUBLIN : Then she keeps trying. That 's the other thing that 's amazing about our clients is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something and want to change their lives. @(Footage-of-William) @!STAHL :( Voiceover) For Cheryl, it was n't easy. She went back to her job counselor... Unidentified Counselor : I mean, there 's no reason why you should n't get this job today, Cheryl. @(Footage-of-William) @!STAHL :( Voiceover)... who sent her on another interview for a job she did n't get. @!Ms-ALDERMAN : Oh, Salomon Smith Barney. @(Footage-of-Alderma) @!STAHL :( Voiceover) On the morning of her big interview, Sharon, as promised, was a nervous wreck, as she practiced with her daughter. @!Ms-ALDERMAN : Salomon Smith Barney story dates back to the 19th century in Philadelphia. I found that out. @(Footage-of-Alderma) @!STAHL :( Voiceover) Dressed, did her makeup, assumed the position, and got encouragement from her kids. @!Ms-ALDERMAN : I 'm feeling good. I 'm ready for whatever comes. If you see me come back down with a big old Kool-Aid smile, you know it went well. @(Footage-of-Alderma) @!STAHL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Yes! @!STAHL : A Kool-Aid smile! @!Ms-ALDERMAN : Unbelievable. I got it! @(Footage-of-William) @!STAHL :( Voiceover) And after several more tries, Cheryl got a job, too, a six-month internship with a city agency. @!Ms-ALDERMAN : OK. I 'll sign for this. @(Footage-of-Alderma) @!STAHL :( Voiceover) No one is claiming that a session at Dress for Success and a new suit will transform these women overnight, but as Nancy Lublin likes to say, you ca n't pull yourself up by your bootstraps if you do n't have any boots. @(Announcements)
