4030941 @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Off-camera) You might think what houses are selling for these days is a steal. But the real steal is what 's going on at the open houses, where sticky fingers can lead to a sticky situation. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) In a suburb of New Jersey, this $1.4 million home is up for sale, and this weekend, there 's an open house to help bring in prospective buyers. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Hi, nice to meet you. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# Hi. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) While most folks have come to check out the cabinets and details of the house, something strange is going on here. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Is n't that nice? @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) See those two women? They seem far more interested in these gifts left from a party the night before. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Look at that. Hey,( makes noise). @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Wait a minute, is she grabbing that and slipping it in her purse? @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Hey, that was awesome. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Right in front of the other visitors to the home? This woman certainly looks like she saw what happened. Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brazen thieves are ready to strike again. See those prescription pills? Again, there 's little doubt this woman witnessed the crime, and this time, she tells her friend. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# Are you positive? @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) But what will they do? They have no idea that the thieves and the woman showing the home are actors, and we 're directing them through ear pieces. But we did n't make this up. Our hidden camera experiment is ripped from the headlines based on these real-life gal pals caught here on surveillance tape. Police say they stole tens of thousands of dollars in items from open houses at pricey Manhattan homes. They got caught. But back in New Jersey, our thieves are still swiping everything in sight. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Did you see my laptop? @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# No. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Did anyone see my... @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# If your laptop 's missing, then it 's those girls. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) This guy seems pretty certain who took that laptop. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# If you, guys, can we just check your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal. Why would you wan na check our... @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# Because there 's a laptop missing. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) But who appointed him sheriff? Well, we later learn that his brother is a cop. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# If you do n't let me see in the bag, then we 're gon na follow you to your car and we 're gon na take your license plate. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# What? @(Inaudible). That 's great. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# I 'm not gon na show him my bag. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# I 'm not... @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# Then you took the laptop. Then that 's my guess is that you took the laptop. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Stop. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Your guess? @!**29;1707;TOOLONG I 'm sorry. I have to go. @(Inaudible). It 's really... @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Well, @(inaudible). 911 OPERATOR @(MALE) 911, where is your emergency? @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# We need you to send a police officer to 108 Shrewsbury. 911 OPERATOR @(MALE) Okay. Sir, what 's the problem? @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) But the police wo n't be coming. They know all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are at it again when these three women walk in. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Tracy, look at this. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Well, that 's nice. Silver? That 's nice. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Silver @(inaudible). @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) At first, they seem paralyzed. But not for long. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# Excuse me. Did you just put something into your bag? @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# What? @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# In your bag. We saw you put some, you know, silver into your bag. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Oh, no. No, no, no. I have this, no. No. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# Do you mind? @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# She was trying to @(inaudible). @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# What are you accusing me of? @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# No, no. We just saw you put something in your bag so we 're just wondering. Yeah. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# While she takes on the thieves, without saying a word to her friend, look at what she 's up to. 911 OPERATOR @(MALE) 911 where is your emergency? @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# 108 Shrewsbury. 911 OPERATOR @(MALE) What 's the purpose, ma'am? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @(Voiceover) Back in the dining room, the emergency is escalating. Our brazen thieves are stealing again, this time, taking gifts out of those bags. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# Hey, miss? What are you doing? Miss, what are you doing? Take it out. Take it out. Take it out. Take it out. Take it out. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Ma'am, you 're kind of being confrontational and that 's making us, I mean uneasy. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# No, no, no, no, no. No, no. Okay, just stay here until police come, you know? So we do n't have any confusion here. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# You know what? I do n't, no. No. This is not, you 're completely mistaken. You 're completely mistaken, all right? @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# Okay, yes. But we, we might be, but you know, but you put something into your bag there. I just saw, again. If you do n't mind, just open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to show you my bag. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# No, you do n't have to. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) And now she literally blocks the door. @!CARRIE-KEATING-@1P# Very brave. And it was clear that she was gaining momentum from her friends. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Colgate University psychology professor Carrie Keating has been watching with us from the floor below. @!CARRIE-KEATING-@1P# One thing we know about intervention is that when people form a team, when one friend reacts, others generally follow suit. Look how quickly they decided that this was an event worth intervening. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Off-camera) You were actually blocking the door. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# Yeah, I was. Yeah. Yeah, I was. I did n't want them to go. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Off-camera) They 're bigger than you are. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# I do n't care. You know, I just wanted to do the right thing. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Off-camera) But these were n't your things that were being stolen. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# I know, I know. But it 's just, I guess a sense of justice or sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again? And what if the thieves are African-American? We swap actors who begin a new crime spree. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Look, in the bags. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Oh. Oh, wow. That @(inaudible). @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# I ca n't believe they just left this out here. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) There 's no doubt this couple sees our thieves with that mink coat. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# I think you should try it on. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Oh, this is their coat. I 'm not gon na try it. @!**29;1738;TOOLONG Try it on. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) And we 're pretty sure this woman back there in the distance is aware of it, too. She also appears to see what happens next. And see that iPod? We 're almost certain the first couple is onto that crime. But more than five minutes go by and no one does a thing. So, we direct our actress, Margo, to speak up. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Any of you noticed that, I thought there was a mink coat in that box over there. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know, I do n't, I thought there was, but I do n't see it. I do n't see it. I do n't... @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Oh, excuse me? @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# She has it in her bag. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# What are you... @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# She has it in her bag. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# What? I came in with this bag. I do n't know what you 're talking about. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# The mink coat 's in her bag. You just stole it from this box. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Stole? @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Now watch these two couples, complete strangers, as the thieves head for the front door. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# You stole the coat. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# No. @!**29;1800;TOOLONG We came in with this. 911 OPERATOR @(MALE) 911, what 's the problem ma'am? @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# There 's an open house and there 's somebody in here stealing things. She stole everything. That girl just stole everything, yes. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# This is really wrong because I have a feeling that you 're doing this because we 're black, honestly. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @(inaudible). @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# No, no. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# It 's not about that. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# Nothing to do with that. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# They said they saw you. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# They just said they 're missing a coat and you happen to have a coat. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# I saw you pick the coat up from the box. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# Yes. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# You went, ' Ooh, nice coat. " @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# She tried it on. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# And now it 's in your... @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# I just do n't understand it. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# No, no, no. You can not go. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# No. Excuse me. I do n't... @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# @(Inaudible). @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# I think I should go, actually. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# Yeah, right. You should wait for the police to come. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) As one couple blocks the door, this woman has slipped out front. 911 OPERATOR @(MALE) 911, where is your emergency? @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# Hi, my emergency is 108 Shrewsbury. 911 OPERATOR @(MALE) Mm-hmm. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# Are the cops coming? 911 OPERATOR @(MALE) Yeah. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to hurry because these people are trying to get away. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Once again, we 're surprised by the response, and this time, among strangers. Psychologists say there 's strength in having someone else back you up. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# Yes, absolutely. I mean, part of me, believe me, said, ' Oh, my God. Let me get out of here quick. " You know, but I didn't. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Off-camera) It was nice to have her here? @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# Oh, absolutely. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# Yeah, exactly. I feel like a stronger, you know, when there are people around me, so I feel I 'm not alone, you know? @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) But remember, no one did a thing until our actress, Margo, spoke up. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Did it cause you to pause a little because they 're African-American? Did you not wan na accuse them? @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# It had nothing to do with the race. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# We are minority, too. We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When it 's wrong, it 's wrong. It does n't matter if you are black, you 're white, you 're yellow, you know, whatever color. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Off-camera) They say they did n't consider race at all. @!CARRIE-KEATING-@1P# Hard to believe that race was n't somewhat of a factor because it 's the first thing we see. And we ca n't help but recognize it. But that does n't mean all of our responses have to be driven by it. And you could see that the respondents were really working hard to correctly assess what was going on in the room and once they were sure, that the fur coat, in fact, had been lifted, that 's when they confronted the women. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) But what if the thief is a black man? While our experiment is hardly scientific, once again, we swap actors. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# Hi there. How are you? @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Hello, good afternoon. Hi. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Until now, women have been noticing all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blue shirt as that ring disappears. And then, that iPod. And as our thief pushes his luck, that gift box, too. Now, watch what he does. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# The fellow that 's walking around... @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# In the open house? @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-#... he 's picked up about four different items and put them in his bag. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# I beg your pardon? @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# He 's picked up about four different items and put them in his bag. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# He has? @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# Yes. What should I do? @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# Excuse me, sir? @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# Yeah? @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# You picked up an iPod over here. Was it yours? @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# No. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# You sure? This lady has been here watching the place. She says it was n't yours. @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# I 'm sorry, what? @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# There was an iPod that was over here I saw you put in your bag. @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# Yeah. It 's mine. I told you. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# Why are you looking so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man. You 're just all in my business. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) It 's then that our thief heads for the door. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# There ai n't gon na be no trouble if you just drop whatever you left and just run. @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# I 'm not running for anything. Excuse me. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# Come on, guy. Do n't do this. Do n't get like that. Come on. Just drop what you left and go. Ai n't gon na be no trouble. @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# I do n't want any trouble. I just wan na leave. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# Well, then, open your bag and drop your stuff. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Off-camera) That was the risky moment, confronting him and accusing him. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# Well, I figure most people are normally honest, so I kind of assume that if I confronted him then he would probably, you know, repent, do the right thing and go. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Off-camera) You gave him a chance to run. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# I gave him a chance to relinquish his goods and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was down on my luck and being stupid enough to steal something, someone would say, ' Hey, buddy, do you really wan na do that? " @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Someone said something in every single scenario. @!CARRIE-KEATING-@1P# They did. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Did n't matter whether the thief was white or black. @!CARRIE-KEATING-@1P# It did n't seem to matter at all. @!PROSPECTIVE-BUYER-# Take it out. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) And remarkably, they took on our thieves in a home that was n't even their own, but that of a stranger. @!CARRIE-KEATING-@1P# In this particular community, people are very likely to step up. They all did 100%. And I think this community is richer for it. @!ANNOUNCER-# Next, the wedding guests have arrived. @!MARK-NOONAN-@1WEDD# Shall we sign? @!ANNOUNCER-# Only problem is, they were n't invited. @!BECCA-@1GUEST@2-# Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson. One wedding, two crashers. That 's my punchline. @!ANNOUNCER-# If these guys crashed the biggest day of your life... @!MARK-NOONAN-@1WEDD# Yeah. @!ANNOUNCER-# What would you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I got him. @!MARK-NOONAN-@1WEDD# Slow down. @!ANNOUNCER-# When we come back.
