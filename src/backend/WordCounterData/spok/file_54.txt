228841 @!ENGBERG : With us now from Des Moines, Iowa, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, and joining in the questioning this morning, Ron Brownstein of The Los Angeles Times. Senator Dole, you 're out there in Iowa because that 's where the presidential campaign year begins, and last night the Republicans there had a straw poll. While it 's true that anybody could vote in that poll, even if they did n't -- even if they do n't come from the state of Iowa, everybody was watching it closely, and the results were that you and Senator Gramm finished in an absolute dead heat, 2,600 votes apiece, with Pat Buchanan coming in third. Now this is going to be regarded as something of a setback for the front-runner, is n't it, and how bad a setback is it? Senator BOB DOLE( Republican, Majority Leader) : Oh, I do n't think so. I mean, this is another straw poll. We 've had a couple of other polls this week, one in Iowa, where I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had 46, Gramm had 4 ; one in Texas where I was ahead of Phil Gramm, but this was a very exciting event. Let 's face it, there were over 10,000 people here. They were from all over mid-America. I even saw a few people from Iowa there last night, and they had a great time and I give Phil Gramm credit. He turned out people. So did Pat Buchanan ; so did Alan Keyes. I mean, I think everybody did the best they could, but this is certainly not indicative of what 's happening in Iowa. We have a good substantial lead here, we 're in a very strong position, and we look forward to next February. @!Mr-RONALD-BROWNSTE : Senator Dole, is it indicative of what 's happening in the party in a broader sense? I mean, you look in that hall last night -- what was getting the biggest applause were -- were the strongest conservative themes, particularly on abortion. When you look at your record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in tune with where the grass roots of this party seems to be going in 1996? @!Sen-DOLE : Oh, I -- I think so. I think the party 's going to return more power to the states, more power to the people, tax relief for families, you know, so -- going after the entertainment industry in the right way without censorship, talking about American values. Dan Quayle, I must say, made an outstanding speech, did a great job as the master of ceremonies. It was just a good event. I -- it is -- you know, on your -- right in front of me there were n't many Dole supporters, sort of a sea of silence, and it 's -- because we had Morry Taylor there, we had Phil Gramm there, we had Alan Keyes, we had Lugar -- Dick Lugar, Lamar Alexander -- everybody was there supporting their candidate, and it was a little -- little scary, frankly, when you look out over -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody else. But, overall, it was a great event. The Republican Party in Iowa 's the big winner ; maybe next to them, the bus companies. @!Mr-BROWNSTEIN : In -- in -- in -- in his speech last night, Pete Wilson basically made the case that the Republican revolution that came out of the House is running off the rails in the Senate. Lamar Alexander said the same thing the other day in Dallas, Pat Buchanan said the same thing last week here on this show. Pete Wilson said last night a legislator with a record like that does n't deserve a promotion. Is the sense that the Republican revolution is, in fact, losing steam in the Senate affecting your campaign? And how do you propose to deal with this question? @!Sen-DOLE : Well, I do n't think it has. He -- we lost the balanced budget amendment by one vote. We 're on welfare reform now. Everything else we 've done. I mean, we 've -- we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done, we 'll have the tax package and the so-called reconciliation bill -- we 've pretty much kept pace, and -- and, of course, Pete Wilson 's been in the Senate. He knows it takes a little more time. Lamar Alexander has not been in the Senate, but we have different rules. We know it takes longer. We know that the Democrats are giving us a hard time. Every time we have a bill they make it -- they offer, you know, hundreds of amendments sometimes to delay it. But we 'll get our job done, and we 'll get it done because of strong leadership in the Senate, and I hope I 'm -- I hope I -- you know, I -- I think I 'm providing strong leadership, and before the year is out, we 'll be all caught up. @!ENGBERG : One question... @!Sen-DOLE : And then Pete Wilson and Lamar Alexander can, I hope, join in the applause. @!ENGBERG : A question about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tie, any time the front-runner misses a beat... @!Sen-DOLE : Right. @!ENGBERG :... everybody looks for chinks in his armor. @!Sen-DOLE : Right. @!ENGBERG : Now there is -- the -- the knock on you is -- is that Dole is leading right now, but that his support may be a mile wide, but it 's only a millimeter thick. Do you fear that maybe your supporters do n't have the kind of commitment to you that, let 's say, the Buchanan or Gramm supporters have because of -- you do n't put the fire in their belly that -- that some of those social issues bring out in people? @!Sen-DOLE : Well, I -- I do n't think so. I 'm a good mainstream conservative, always have been, probably as conservative as the others in the race, but, you know, we did n't invest any campaign money. We did n't go out and buy a lot of tickets with campaign money. We 've -- we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A lot -- you know, some candidates put a lot of money into this. This is make-or-break for some of them. And they -- you know, they did -- they did all right, but... @!ENGBERG : And they out-organized you. @!Sen-DOLE : To some extent. I think we -- there was some complacency, but -- but we 're not in -- we 're going to go right on to the next event today. I 'm heading for Arizona after this to speak to the national VFW convention and a group of our supporters in Arizona. We 're right on target. We have a strong lead across the country, and we 're going to maintain that lead, and I think you 'll see in the next few weeks a number of very important endorsements coming our way which indicate that we 're the pre-eminent favorite right now. @!Mr-BROWNSTEIN : Let me ask you about some of the issues on your plate when you return to Washington next month. @!Sen-DOLE : Sure. @!Mr-BROWNSTEIN : Medicare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : President Clinton put out a health-care plan in September of ' 93, the country spent the year debating it ; flaws were found in it and, ultimately, it was rejected. Your budget has committed you to making changes of comparable magnitude in the Medicare program, and yet, here we are, three or four weeks before you 're scheduled to begin voting on it, and you still have n't released publicly what exactly you plan to do. Can you give us some specifics here today about how you 're going to restructure this program which affects virtually every senior citizen in the country? @!Sen-DOLE : In fact, we have to have it done by September 22nd, and we 're going to be working on it when we get back on the 5th of September. In addition to welfare reform, if the Democrats do n't filibuster that, we 'll pass the Worker Opportunity Act of 1995. What we hope to do is restrain the rate of growth of Medicare and to preserve and strengthen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know, three members of his Cabinet assigned the trustees ' report saying this program 's going to be broke in the next six to seven years. Now the president -- the president also... @!Mr-BROWNSTEIN : What are the specific ways you 're going to do that, Senator? @!Sen-DOLE : The president also cuts Medicare and also cuts taxes, so I -- I think what -- he 's trying to have it both ways, but we 'll get it done. @!Mr-BROWNSTEIN : What are the specific ways, though, that you 're going to do that? It 's going to be voted on, as you say, within three weeks. We still have no specifics about how you plan to achieve a $ 270 billion reduction in the plan over the next seven years. @!Sen-DOLE : And you 'll have that in about -- I think in about 10 days -- no, in about three weeks you 'll have that plan. @!Mr-BROWNSTEIN : And there will be then days for the country to consider it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? @!Sen-DOLE : Well, I -- I think it 's pretty generally out there. We know we have to reduce the rate of -- rate of growth. We 're not talking Med -- we 're also going to make certain if people want to keep what they have, they can keep what they have. We 're talking about more managed care. People want more managed care, more choices for seniors, and we 're going to be spending much more money, as everybody knows. We 're going to spend a lot more money. We 're going to go from $ 4,700 up to $ 6,700 average in the next seven years, so it 's not that we 're cutting back. We 're still going to be spending more on Medicare. We are going to restrain the rate of growth. We think that 's possible... @!Mr-BROWNSTEIN : You -- you -- you... @!Sen-DOLE :... without doing any damage to seniors. @!Mr-BROWNSTEIN : You just said people will be able to keep what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Clinton plan was that it would restrict freedom of choice. Can you say here today that seniors who want to continue to see their own doctors will face no financial penalty as a result of doing that? They 'll have no higher co-payments, no higher deductible? @!Sen-DOLE : That 's what we 're striving to do. Now we -- we have n't achieved that. We 're not there yet. But just let me suggest that 's going to be our goal. But, you know, we do n't have to pay the most for medicine to have the best program, whether it 's Medicare, Medicaid, whatever it may be. But our view is that if we do n't do something, we 're not going to be able to pay anybody 's Medicare benefits, Part A or Part B -- Part A 's hospitals, Part B is doctors -- and if we listen to President Clinton, this program -- program 's going to be broke in six years, and he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I may turn to foreign affairs. @!Sen-DOLE : Yes. @!ENGBERG : Three American officials were killed in the Balkan conflict yesterday, the first Americans to die over there. Do you think that tells us that we need to take another look at our policy over there? @!Sen-DOLE : Well, certainly, first of all, it 's a tragedy, and I certainly have -- send my condolences to the families of the Americans who were killed. But let 's keep in mind the Serbs refused to give them safe passage, they were on a very dangerous highway because of Serb activity, and it seems to me we have to recognize sooner than later that the Serbs have been the aggressors, the Serbs are causing us problems and they were indirectly responsible for the deaths of these three Americans. @!ENGBERG : The president has vetoed lifting the arms embargo. Do you have any doubt you 've got the votes to override that veto, and when right -- might we see that vote? @!Sen-DOLE : Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll decide. I 'll s -- I 'll sit down with Senator Lieberman from Connecticut, a Democrat, and others, and determine when to bring it up. I would hope there 'd be a negotiated settlement ; it would n't be necessary. But let 's face it, the president and others are making offers to Serbia to lift the sanctions if Serbia recognizes Croatia and Bosnia. That recognition does n't do any good. My view is that you ca n't trust Milosevic, you ca n't trust Karadzic, you ca n't touch -- trust Mladic, the military leader, and -- and I think what we 're doing is unfair to the Bosnians who -- all they -- all they want is a right to defend themselves. We 've already seen what happens when the Croats had arms. They were successful, and we 've kept arms away from the Bosnians. We have n't given them the right to defend themselves, even though they 're an independent nation and entitled to that right under Article 51 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a few days, the administration has to decide whether the first lady should go to China for a conference there. Do you think that Hillary Clinton should go to China? @!Sen-DOLE : We 've written a letter to that effect not to go to China. I offered an amendment. The Democrats blocked it on the Senate floor. I do n't see any useful purpose. Certainly she 's very bright, very articulate, but in my view -- it seems to me that if they -- as long as they 're retaining an American prisoner there, Harry Wu, and as long as there 's other human rights abuses -- we 're talking about starving children now in China, I think it 'd be a mistake for the first lady to go. @!Mr-BROWNSTEIN : Senator, can we jump back to politics for one moment? @!Sen-DOLE : Sure. @!Mr-BROWNSTEIN : Senator Bradley is going to be on the show later today. He said he 's thinking about running as an Independent in 1996. How would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him out there or rather see him on the sideline? @!Sen-DOLE : Well, I do n't know. He -- he 's a very respected senator. He 's a friend of mine. I 'm sorry he did n't -- he -- he made a lot of phone calls. He did n't call me. I was sort of sitting by the phone. But he 's a good person. Whether or not he would -- what impact he would have -- I think it 's too early to tell. There 's always -- you 're always the most -- well, you 're most -- the most likely candidate until you get into the arena. But Bill Bradley 's been around, people know where he is on the issues, he votes pretty much with Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts. He voted with President Clinton 87 percent of the time last year, but that does n't mean he ca n't find differences with President Clinton -- maybe it 's style, maybe it 's substance. But he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!Mr-BROWNSTEIN : Can I ask you, very quickly, a final -- final political question? Last week in Ro -- at the convention in Dallas a lot of interest from Ross Perot supporters about campaign finance reform. Does n't seem to be on the -- very high on the agenda of the Republicans in Congress. Any chance that there will be action to reform the campaign finance system before the next election? @!Sen-DOLE : Well, there were three items on Perot 's list. Lobbying reform we 've already done in the Senate, they have n't done in the House ; gift reform, we 've done that in the Senate, they have n't done in the House. I suggested precisely what President Clinton and the speaker suggested three years ago : Let 's have an independent commission, let 's took at ca -- look at campaign finance reform, and let 's give the House and Senate an up or down vote. Campaign finance reform, in my view, is something that should be looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be accomplished. @!ENGBERG : Senator, one last question. @!Sen-DOLE : Sure. @!ENGBERG : Some people have criticized you and the other leaders for not opening up the Packwood ethics investigation to the public. Is there any chance that there will be public hearings on the Packwood case? @!Sen-DOLE : Well, I think you 're talking about the integrity of the committee process. My view is the committee 's going -- the Ethics Committee, made up of three Democrats and three Republicans -- it 's not -- not a partisan committee -- will make a report, will make a recommendation, and that will come, as I understand it, within a couple of weeks or maybe three weeks after we return in September. I do n't see any need for public hearings. Now depending on what comes out of that -- whatever the recommendation is, whatever the Senate does, somebody might raise a question at that point. @!ENGBERG : Thank you very much, Senator Dole. @!Sen-DOLE : Thank you. @!ENGBERG : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we return, we 'll talk with retiring Senator Bill Bradley. Back in a moment. @(Commercial-break)
