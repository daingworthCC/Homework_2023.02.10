231441 @!ANNOUNCER : July 23rd, 1992. DIANE SAWYER, ABC News : voice-over A PrimeTime undercover investigation, phony insurance companies. KERRY FIELDS : A lot of people out there do n't have insurance right now and do n't know it @!SAWYER voice-over You have a car accident. You think you 're covered, but when you try to collect, you find out your insurance is worthless. SAM DONALDSON, ABC News : So, this company gave you a hot check? LORRAINE FERRIS : Right @!SAWYER voice-over Tonight, Sam Donaldson tracks down people accused of scamming millions from clients like you @!DONALDSON Mr. Gebel, I must tell you, a lot of people who look at the things you have done believe that you 're nothing but a con artist. voice-over Tonight, more people step forward to say they were abused by Father James Porter. 1st ACCUSER : Any opportunity that he had to abuse someone, you know, in any way that you can imagine, he did it @!DONALDSON voice-over Three weeks ago, Diane Sawyer told you how dozens, possibly hundreds of children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later, one man broke the silence and tracked down the abuser. FRANK FITZPATRICK : When did you stop molesting children? Father JAMES PORTER : As far as I know now, it 's way back in ' 67 @!DONALDSON voice-over Now, PrimeTime has learned what Porter said may not be true. Apparently, the abuse did n't stop, and the Church continued to give Porter easy access to children around the country @!SAWYER voice-over Last week, she was the toast of the Democratic Convention, but a few months ago, she was an unknown working woman in politics who simply got furious watching this on TV. 1st SENATOR : There appeared to be, quote, " an alien pubic hair floating around in my gyn. " 2nd SENATOR : The testimony of Professor Hill in the morning was flat out perjury @!SAWYER voice-over So, Carol Moseley Braun decided what the heck, she 'd run for office. Tonight, Jay Schadler with the story of the woman who could be the first black female in the Senate, her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give in. Never give in. Never, never, never. God bless you all @!DONALDSON voice-over Yeah, right. Mr. PEROT : So, therefore, I will not become a candidate @!DONALDSON voice- over Do n't worry, Mr. Perot. You 're not the first high profile person to bail out of a tight spot. Tonight, the Quitters ' Hall of Fame. @!ANNOUNCER : From ABC News, with anchors Diane Sawyer in New York, Sam Donaldson in Los Angeles, Chief Correspondent Chris Wallace, Judd Rose, Jay Schadler, Sylvia Chase and John Quinones, this is PrimeTime. Commercial break @!ANNOUNCER : PrimeTime. From Los Angeles, Sam Donaldson @!DONALDSON Good evening. We begin tonight with a story that may include you, only you do n't know it, but believe me, if your in it, you 're in trouble. It 's a story about worthless insurance policies and the unscrupulous people who set up the companies that market them. Remember, you do n't really know how good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it. As you 're about to see, a lot of people all over this country thought they were getting a good deal on insurance, but found out too late they were actually getting taken. Highway Robbery 2nd PHONY INSURANCE VICTIM : When we had an accident, we immediately turned it over to our agent and the insurance company was about to be issued a cease and desist order, leaving us personally liable for over $100,000 in claims and attorney 's fees. 3rd PHONY INSURANCE VICTIM : When you 're a victim of this, you spend a lot of time crying. These people do bank on you giving up. I suggest anybody who has insurance documents to check them thoroughly. 4th PHONY INSURANCE VICTIM : You buy insurance because the state says you ca n't drive without insurance, but then what happens? You guys do n't help us when we do buy the insurance, because you allow these companies to sell. KERRY FIELDS : These guys are fast. They can go in or out real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fields is a former Texas State insurance investigator. interviewing Can you give me an estimate of how many of these phony companies may be working right this moment here in the United States? Ms. FIELDS : That we know of, 500 @!DONALDSON Five hundred companies? Ms. FIELDS : A lot of people out there do n't have insurance right now and do n't know it @!DONALDSON voice-over When Lorraine Ferris had an accident, she thought she had nothing to worry about. After all, she had a policy with a company called Union Pacific Fire and Marine Limited. She sent them the bill for fixing her auto. LORRAINE FERRIS : Eventually they came up with a check, and they paid it @!DONALDSON How much was the check? Ms. FERRIS : Three thousand forty-one dollars @!DONALDSON And you deposited it? Ms. FERRIS : I deposited it, along with the auto body shop, and it came back " closed account. " DONALDSON : So, this company gave you a hot check? Ms. FERRIS : Right @!DONALDSON voice-over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific Fire and Marine. They 've been trying to collect for over a year. DIANE COLERAS : Ca n't find a telephone, ca n't find a person to talk to - you get the machines or the number has been disconnected. CHARLES COLERAS : If I could find these fellows I like to grab them by the neck, believe me @!DONALDSON voice-over There are 650 policyholders with $4.5 million worth of claims looking for the fellows at Union Pacific Fire and Marine. Finding anyone from that company is no easy matter. They are registered in the British Virgin Islands, but do n't look for any big corporate offices there. That 's simply where they 've filed their papers of registration. It 's a strategy used by many of these companies to make it difficult for investigators to regulate them. Their letterhead shows an address in Atlanta, Georgia. So, we dropped in and found it to be a suite of rental offices. The leasing agent told us : LEASING AGENT : They 're no longer a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they 're not longer clients @!PRIMETIME Do you know where they 've moved to? LEASING AGENT : No, I do n't have any forwarding address or anything @!DONALDSON voice-over We tracked them to Springfield, Illinois, and discovered they 'd tried to purchase another company, Heartland Insurance Company of America. Illinois Deputy Director of Regulatory Action Norm Kouffed reviewed their application, and found they were not being truthful in describing their assets. NORM KOUFFED : They did not even own the assets they said they owned, but they were simply leasing them to make their financial position look better @!DONALDSON voice-over The application, filed by Union Pacific Fire and Marine, states that the ultimate controlling party, after purchasing Heartland, would be one Anthony DiDio, Jr., who, it turns out, works in a gun shop in Glendale California. He often supplies firearms for motion picture special effects, an odd background for running an insurance company. This was a man we had to meet. interviewing Tony Didio? ANTHONY DiDIO : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. DiDIO : How do you do? DONALDSON : Could we talk to you for just a moment about your insurance company? Mr. DiDIO : You 've got the wrong- DiDio is my last name. You 've got the wrong guy @!DONALDSON I have? I 'm looking for a guy who is listed as the owner of Union Pacific Fire and Marine. CO- WORKER : That 's not him @!DONALDSON It 's not you? You signed the papers in Illinois, but you do n't know anything about the business. Mr. DiDIO : I was willing to help the company, but it 's my father 's business @!DONALDSON Well, should n't his name have been filed? Mr. DiDIO : Well, it probably was. I really do n't know what to tell you about it. You 'll have to talk to him @!DONALDSON Well, does this strike you as odd? Mr. DiDIO : No, not really. Mr. KOUFFED : It would appear to be an attempt to defraud or deceive the Illinois Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were granting permission for @!DONALDSON voice-over Another name on this application is Earl Gebel, Chief Financial Officer of Union Pacific Fire and Marine. on camera He lists this address in El Segundo, California as his office. So, let 's see what we find. interviewing Hello, is anybody here? Excuse me. I 'm looking for the office of the Union Pacific Fire and Marine Insurance Company. Is this it? POST OFFICE BOX ATTENDANT : No, it 's their mailing address @!DONALDSON 531 Main Street, Suite 530, El Segundo, California? POST OFFICE BOX ATTENDANT : Uh-huh @!DONALDSON And that 's it? POST OFFICE BOX ATTENDANT : Yeah, uh-huh. FRED FISHER : They hide behind aliases. They hide behind mail drops. They hide behind corporate shells. They have multiple servicing organizations in five different states @!DONALDSON voice-over Fred Fisher is a California Claims adjuster who 's seen how fly-by-night insurance companies operate. Mr. FISHER : I would suggest to you that this is a form of economic violence unheralded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dollars in unpaid claims, not just in California, but elsewhere in states like New York, and New Jersey, and Florida and Pennsylvania @!DONALDSON voice- over If you live in California, and fear your insurance company is a fraud, this is the man who breaks the bad news to hundreds of Insurance Company Hotline callers every year. He is Dan Bethel, California Department of Insurance. DAN BETHEL : They 're puzzled as to why this company is n't paying claims, when I paid my premiums as I was supposed to. Once they find out that it 's a non-admitted carrier and what that means, that 's usually when the outrage comes. How could this happen? DONALDSON : Now, that 's a key word to remember, non-admitted, because when it comes to state regulation and supervision, there are only two classifications of insurance companies, admitted and non-admitted. voice-over Admitted companies must prove their financial worth, submit to strict state supervision, and in most cases, contribute to a state guarantee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. On the other hand, non-admitted companies can do business, but they 're not licensed and are far less regulated. Reputable ones, like Lloyd 's of London, have a good track record of performance. on camera But too many non-admitted companies have no ratings record, making them terribly risky to do business with. That 's why most states require that non-admitted insurance policies be stamped with a large warning making it clear to the buyer they are on their own, and there is little the state can do if the company turns out to be fraudulent. voice-over California law requires that customers be told at the time they apply that coverage is being placed with a non-admitted company, and have the risk explained to them. We wanted to see if brokers routinely do this, so we drove around Los Angeles and dropped in at random, asking for an insurance quote on a 1988 Nissan 280 for an owner with two speeding tickets. Under those circumstances, the cost would be about $2,500 a year, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Farm, All State and Aetna. INSURANCE AGENT : If you pay the whole amount at one time, it would be $1,037 @!DONALDSON voice-over But when we asked how well that would cover us, he was very reassuring. INSURANCE AGENT : I give you a beautiful company, Lloyds of London, one of the biggest companies, the bank of Lloyds @!PRIMETIME And you say it 's admitted? INSURANCE AGENT : Non-admitted. It means they 're main office is not here in California, it means their main office is outside @!DONALDSON voice-over We asked Dennis Ward, Chief of California 's Insurance Enforcement Division to look at what we found. DENNIS WARD : Even though as an investigator you sit back and you suspect, based on other factors, that this is rampant, when you actually see it, it is surprising. He claims that not-admitted is simply a company that does n't have an office in California. That 's not the case at all. The significant point that he needed to make is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain the consequences of dealing with a company that 's not licensed @!DONALDSON And why would customers find such companies appealing in the first place? Why not go with one of the big names in the insurance business? Because the non-admitted companies usually charge lower rates, are willing to insure higher risks, and the incentive for the broker or agent to sell them is they usually pay higher commissions, but Lorraine Ferris says it was n't worth it. Ms. FERRIS : I mean I literally just- I got incredibly angry. I did everything in my power, Sam, to remedy the problem. I mean, I spent hours and hours on the phone phoning people, trying to figure out how to get through. I could never get through to Earl Gebel. I mean that was an impossibility @!DONALDSON voice-over Oh, people can get through to Earl Gebel, Union Pacific Fire and Marine 's Chief Financial Officer, if they wrote. He regularly collected his mail in El Segundo. One day it filled three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to them, but one day we tracked him down, as he finished playing a round of golf. interviewing Mr. Gebel. I 'm Sam Donaldson of PrimeTime Live. Can I talk to you about your insurance company, Union Pacific Fire and Marine? A lot of people say that you have n't paid their claims. Have you? EARL GEBEL : We have paid claims @!DONALDSON It 's estimated that about $4.5 million that you have n't paid. Is that right? Mr. Gebel, do you really have an insurance company? Mr. GEBEL : Yes @!DONALDSON Can you tell me where it 's located? Mr. GEBEL : The office is in Illinois now @!DONALDSON It 's in where in Illinois? Mr. GEBEL : In Palestine, Illinois @!DONALDSON Well, what is the telephone number? Mr. GEBEL : I do n't have it on me. I have it on the correspondence. No, it 's in- It 's in Illinois. It 's 708- Why do n't you call Chicago, Illinois and find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of your own insurance company? Mr. GEBEL : I do n't call it @!DONALDSON Could I ask why the office is in Illinois? Mr. GEBEL : Because it 's in the middle of the country @!DONALDSON voice-over Well, we went to the address printed on Mr. Gebel 's letterhead, a building in Palestine, Illinois, and sure enough, there on the building directory is a listing for Union Pacific Fire and Marine Insurance. A week after viewing our tape of Mr. Gebel, Illinois regulators obtained a search warrant and went to search this office. Turns out Gebel had been paying the people $300 to front for his insurance company. interviewing Mr. Gebel, I must tell you, a lot of people who look at the things you have done believe that you 're nothing but a con-artist. Mr. GEBEL : Well, they 're incorrect @!DONALDSON I talked to a woman today that you gave a hot check to. Mr. GEBEL : Who is that? DONALDSON : Lorraine Ferris was her name. Mr. GEBEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check. That account was closed. Please know that. No one got a hot check @!DONALDSON But you gave a check to her, and she tried to cash it, and they said the account was closed. What is that. Mr. GEBEL : Yes, because I think by Merrill Lynch closed the account @!DONALDSON Well, Mr. Gebel, is this the way you do business? Mr. GEBEL : May I conclude this? DONALDSON : Certainly. voice-over Merrill Lynch told us that after warning Gebel he had written too many hot checks, when he persisted in writing more, it closed his account. Lorraine Ferris, who was given a hot check, eventually did get her money, but the Coleras ' are still waiting, and they are very bitter. Mrs. COLERAS : These companies come. They sell their insurance, and then they 're gone, and the State of California allows the fraud to happen. Mr. COLERAS : I 'm a very honest person. I 'm down to earth, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't. That 's being very gullible. I doubt this ever will be again @!DONALDSON So, how do you avoid getting taken? Well, check your policy, and if it 's with a non-admitted company, look into that company 's payment record immediately before it 's too late, and when you buy a new policy, make certain the agent explains the company 's classification, and if it 's not admitted, explains the risk. Many experts are urging states to require that all companies be licensed and closely supervised, but until that happens, it 's up to you to know what you 're buying. @!ANNOUNCER : Still ahead, a woman poised to make history. History 's most well-known quitters, but next, new charges of sexual abuse by Father James Porter @!ACCUSER He 's a monster. He 's almost worse than a murderer. @!ANNOUNCER : The secret is out. You 'll see how over and over again, the Church put a known child molester within easy striking distance of his victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, now from New York, Diane Sawyer @!SAWYER Sometimes our stories on PrimeTime close the chapter on a subject, but three weeks ago, we brought you a story which only opened the flood gates to more. After we told you about Father James Porter, accused of abusing children in one Catholic parish after another in Massachusetts, our phones began to ring. New people came forward with information about Porter and the Church that turned away from its children, it turns out not just in that little Massachusetts town, North Addleborough, but all across the country. Secret No More Follow-Up 1st ACCUSER : It became our secret for 30 years. 2nd ACCUSER : We were all ashamed. We were all ashamed @!SAWYER voice-over Three weeks ago, we told you how this town 's terrible secret surfaced because of one man named Frank Fitzpatrick. We told you how Fitzpatrick 's 30-year-old memories reawakened, of a favorite priest, a weekend outing, a 12-year-old boy betrayed. FRANK FITZPATRICK : The next thing I knew, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me, sodomizing me @!SAWYER voice-over Fitzpatrick decided to see if there might be others. The answer came back, a tidal wave of pain. 3rd ACCUSER : He threw me on the floor of the sacristy and raped me. 4th ACCUSER : Once or twice a week. 5th ACCUSER : I was 10-years-old the first time. 6th ACCUSER : Kept telling me that God was watching. 7th ACCUSER : How many times did he molest me in my bedroom? I ca n't say 10, I ca n't say 15, I ca n't say 40 @!SAWYER voice-over In our broadcast, 22 people from that small, Catholic community spoke out on camera. As of tonight, 60 have come forward, and all are convinced there are hundreds more. Mr. FITZPATRICK : He molested or raped every kid he could get his hands on. He destroyed hundreds of children 's childhood @!SAWYER voice-over And so that 's why Fitzpatrick, a professional investigator, decided to track down Porter. He discovered that Porter had left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and four children in Minnesota. Mr. FITZPATRICK : Hi. This is Frank Fitzpatrick. Mr. PORTER : Yes. Mr. FITZPATRICK : From North Addleborough. Mr. PORTER : Yes @!SAWYER voice-overJames Porter made no attempt at denial. Mr. FITZPATRICK : One question, why did you do that kind of thing. Mr. PORTER : I do n't know. Mr. FITZPATRICK : Do you have anything you want to say to me about it, you know? Mr. PORTER : No, what can I say. Mr. FITZPATRICK : You 're sorry? Mr. PORTER : Am I? Of course, very, very, very, very. That 's why it was taken care of. Mr. FITZPATRICK : When did you stop- When did you stop molesting children? When did you stop? Mr. PORTER : Well, as far as I know now, being for sure, it 's way back in around ' 67. Mr. FITZPATRICK : Sixty- seven, okay @!SAWYER And indeed, in 1967, James Porter did go to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our broadcast, a center devoted to priests with problems, but PrimeTime has learned that despite what Father Porter said on the telephone, the trouble did not stop there. voice-over While Porter was being treated, he worked in this parish in southern New Mexico, but he was moved out after allegedly molesting boys on a church-owned boat. The men, who were seven and eight at the time, have not yet spoken out. Bruce Pasternak is their attorney. BRUCE PASTERNAK : He was as out-of- control in New Mexico as he had been in Massachusetts @!SAWYER voice- over Pasternak also alleges that Porter served as a chaplain to a crippled children 's hospital, and abused the children there. Mr. PASTERNAK : He was caught sodomizing a child who had recently had surgery and was confined to a body cast @!SAWYER voice-over But a year later there was no mention of this when the Church sent out its letter of recommendation, saying after his treatment, Porter shows every sign of having recovered remarkably, that Porter had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well. The letter was addressed to an unsuspecting little community in Minnesota. 8th ACCUSER : You could n't yell. You could n't scream. 9th ACCUSER : Sodomy, rape? 8th ACCUSER : It got worse as time went on. 9th ACCUSER : This man is a monster @!SAWYER PrimeTime has learned of 16 people who say Porter abused them starting in 1969, after his treatment when the Church moved him to Bemidji, a quiet resort town in northern Minnesota. Dan Dow, Jim Grim and Brothers Leo and Mark Smith are all former altar boys who told of their beguiling basketball coach and priest who did unspeakable things to children. DAN DOW : At the rectory, in the church, in the locker room, any opportunity that he had to abuse someone, you know, in any way that you can imagine, he did it @!SAWYER voice-over After 22 years, they were stunned to hear Porter 's name on the news. JIM GRIM : I read an article about Father Porter, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away. LEO SMITH : It was like a big explosion within, you know, within me, it was like- MARK SMITH : It tore my heart out @!SAWYER vocie-over Like the children in Massachusetts, they did n't think their parents would believe them, and they were afraid of Porter, too. Mr. SMITH : He would make comments like, you know, I 'll slash your neck with a belt buckle, or things like that that was n't necessarily directed towards me, but I mean, the threat was there, and he was, you know, I was just intimidated @!SAWYER voice- over Last week two of the men gave a press conference about Porter. Mr. GRIM : He told me that what was going on was part of becoming a man in the Church, that this was part of becoming a better Catholic @!SAWYER voice- over Dan Dow said that after a year of abuse, he was the twelve-year-old boy who finally broke the silence. Mr. DOW : I was the victim of Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parents of Dow and Grim got a lawyer and forced the bishop to get rid of Porter. That same day, Porter left Bemidji, and eventually made his way back to treatment in New Mexico. Mr. DOW : To find out that they knew about it before he was here, and that what we went through should never have happened, and looking back on it and seeing, you know, my childhood may have been different had I not been abused by this guy. It 's worse than murder, because we 've got to live with it @!SAWYER voice-over The whole town of Bemidji is in a state of outrage tonight, not just because of Father Porter and what he did 20 years ago, but the Church that deceived its own diocese. Monsignor MIKE PATNODE : courtesy KSTP The treatment center recommended him and they said, as we indicate, that he had recovered and given every sign of having his former problems under control @!SAWYER voice- over Monsignor Mike Patnode is the spokesperson for the diocese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally appalled at the thought that this man whom we had seen, you know, having caused so much pain in Massachusetts, that he had actually been in our diocese as well @!SAWYER voice-over Last week, Dow, Grim and five other men in Minnesota filed suit against Porter, their local diocese, and the diocese of Fall River Massachusetts. Their attorney is Jeff Anderson. JEFF ANDERSON : The magnitude of devastation done by Father Porter to the humans, and the magnitude of the level of knowledge and the concealment of it by the Church in this case is comparable to none. Mr. GRIM : They put themselves up as an institution that guides morals, and they 're hypocritical, and it 's got to stop @!SAWYER And what has the Church said since our piece? There 's still no word from the priest we told you about, the one who allegedly walked in on Porter molesting the children, then shut the door and walked away @!PRIMETIME Father Annunziato, we 've talked to some of Father Porter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room and you saw them being abused. They want to know why you did n't protect them. They trusted you @!SAWYER And yet again we tried to reach someone at the Vatican embassy in Washington, D.C. Our call was never returned, and Father Porter? Well, you 'll remember his reaction when we tried to talk with him in Minnesota. interviewing Mr. Porter, may I talk with you? Mr. PORTER : Kick his royal ass @!SAWYER Mr. Porter, may I speak with you on behalf of the people of Massachusetts, the young people there? Mr. PORTER : Get the police @!SAWYER Mr. Porter, you do n't have to call the police. We just want to know if there 's anything you want to say? Mr. PORTER : Get the cops @!SAWYER voice-over At first, Porter said nothing about our broadcast in which he had said that the abuse stopped in 1967, but then, last week, with the knowledge of the new charges from Bemidji, he issued a statement saying he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was a very sick man while I was a Roman Catholic priest in the 1960 's. I have not had sexual contact with any child since I left the priesthood in 1974. " on camera But PrimeTime has been told that Father Porter 's statement is still not the truth. For the past 16 years, Porter has lived in a community called Oakdale, Minnesota, in two separate houses. The police in Oakdale now say they have reports from three people, all three neighbors at Porter 's first residence, a man and two women, who say Porter abused them well after 1974. MICHAEL HUBER : I just, you know, was kind of confused and scared, did n't know exactly know what was going on @!SAWYER voice-over Michael Huber said Porter pinned him against a car in the Porter 's garage in 1978. Huber was 13. Mr. HUBER : The whole time he was holding me there grinding, moving around like that and telling me we could have some real fun, you know, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some real fun @!ANN We are n't being accounted for, and I want him to come out and say, " Yes, I did still have this problem, " and " Yes, it does reoccur. " SAWYER : voice-over For the first time, Porter 's former babysitter is speaking out, a woman who asked to be identified only as Ann. She says she was a young teenager when the final incident of abuse occurred. He called her into the bedroom, put her hands on him. It was 1981 @!ANN He had an erection, and I just kind of stood there in shock for a few- for, I guess I do n't know how long, if it was a few minutes, so he just kind of stood there for I do n't know how long, and then, as soon as I realized what was going on and what might go on, I left @!SAWYER voice-over Ann says she ran home never to return to the Porter house again. Like the others, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so, from Massachusetts to New Mexico to Minnesota, one-by-one, the victims of James Porter are coming forward, calling for justice from him and from the Church they say turned away. Mr. SMITH : Last week I had to do something that no parent should ever have to do. I had to tell my daughter about sexual abuse by a priest. And she said, " Daddy, why did the Church let him do that to you? " and I said- and I sat and thought for a minute, and I said, " I do n't know, " and she said, " Daddy, why did the Church let him do that to everybody, all his victims? " and I said, " I do n't know, " and I 'm still waiting for an answer, and I honestly do n't think that I 'll ever get one @!SAWYER First, a note about prosecution, because of the statutes of limitation in Massachusetts, Minnesota and New Mexico, it 's unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Now, after our piece, many of you asked questions about pedophilia. Here are some answers from the experts. They say that pedophilia is probably caused by some combination of child abuse and/or hormone, chromosomal or brain abnormality, that those who experience it tend to recognize the desire when they reach puberty, that treatment is possible, including drugs and therapy, but listen to a foremost expert, Dr. Fred Berlin, who has been affiliated with Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. We told him about some of the things Porter said in that phone call. Mr. PORTER : And we figured out if I left, that might be the solution, and that was the solution. Mr. FITZPATRICK : Getting away from being a priest you mean? Mr. PORTER : Yeah, that was the biggest cure. Dr. FRED BERLIN : I would be very reluctant to talk about a cure. You and I, when we 're older, are still going to be attracted to the same kinds of people that we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the problem for the pedophile. They should never think of themselves as having come into a situation where they 're no longer going to be tempted by children. Mr. PORTER : And after that I started, you know, get a real interest. Well, maybe I 'd like to get married eventually. So that more psychological tests to see how I was doing with that. And they agreed on, everything was fine @!SAWYER For someone who went through a brief treatment period, came out, says he got married, that took care of it. That 's not the kind of treatment you 're talking about? Dr. BERLIN : I would have a high index of suspicion that this person would still be at risk of behaving in a similar fashion, and I would be very worried whether or not this individual is fooling themselves, or perhaps fooling the rest of them @!SAWYER Is one of the key things, then, keeping the temptation away, making sure the- Dr. BERLIN : Absolutely. If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in a bar. In fact, I would make the point that the child is to the pedophile, in a sense, what the bottle of alcohol is to the alcoholic. @!ANNOUNCER : Coming up, Carol Moseley Braun, the Senate may never be the same when PrimeTime continues after this from our ABC stations. Commercial break SAWYER : And now, for some new developments in two stories that created quite a stir on our broadcast. voice-over Remember our undercover investigation of repairmen who try to rip you off? Well, Gina Butafocco, from Middle Village New York wrote us to say some of the tips we gave out came in handy when she had a repairman come in to fix her air conditioner. GINA BUTAFOCCO : He peered inside, and in about five seconds, he said you need a new motor @!SAWYER voice-over But Mrs. Butafocco did just as we suggested. She stayed in the room. She asked a lot of questions. She even asked for the broken part. In the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his price, and she ended up saving about $175. And six months ago, we told you about a remarkable and controversial breakthrough that allows autistic children to communicate for the first time in their lives. A doctor discovered that if someone lightly steadied their hands, the children could speak through typing. Well, we received dozens of moving letters like this one from Marilyn Dixon of Round Rock, Texas who said the program was an answer to her prayers. Her daughter Kimberly had been labelled profoundly brain injured, and at age six, had never really spoken. After seeing the broadcast, Marilyn immediately tried the method with her daughter. MARILYN DIXON : And I said, Kimberly, do you think you could spell apple, and she immediately, I mean I felt her hand go a- p-p-l-e, and I started giving her other words, and she 'd just spell them right out @!SAWYER voice-over Kimberly is now reading at a sixth-grade level. She 's even writing her own stories like this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not retarded, I am very sagacious. I like to type words that are different because I want people to know that I am intelligent. " PrimeTime continues in a moment. Commercial break SAWYER : Every one of us has probably been watching television at one time or another and yelled out, " That 's it. I 'm going to do something about it. " But when it happened to Carol Moseley Braun, she was a low-profile working woman in politics in Chicago. It looked like a pipe dream to take on Senator Alan Dixon, a popular two-term incumbent and fellow Democrat, who seemed to be a shoe-in for a second term. The experts laughed at her. She did n't have a chance, but as Jay Schaedler reports, not only is she sporting one stunning primary victory, in this year of the woman, she seems to be the woman to watch. Year of the Woman CAROL MOSELEY BRAUN : Anybody who tells you that my vote wo n't make a difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illinois. People went to the polls. Their vote made a difference, and we 're sending the first African-American woman in history to the United States Senate. Thank you, thank you. JAY SCHADLER, ABC News : Does n't it sometimes just stun you that you 're on the edge of something that truly is historic? Think about it. Ms. BRAUN : Yeah, maybe after November 3rd I 'll think about it @!SCHADLER voice-over The folks in Illinois have been thinking about it ever since last Spring when 44-year-old Carol Moseley Braun danced on the grave of the state 's political establishment. Her victory in the Democratic primary here came courtesy, in part, of a massive turnout of women voters, who saw her as a political dragonslayer. Professor ANITA HILL : My name is Anita F. Hill @!SCHADLER voice-over You can forget all the conventional wisdom about women in politics. It 's a new game, and millions of women can mark the day when the old one ended and the new one began. interviewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running for the Senate had it not been for Anita Hill? Ms. BRAUN : It 's fair to say that I would not have run for the Senate had the Senate not gone on television. 1st SENATOR : There appeared to be, quote, " an alien pubic hair floating around in my gyn " 2nd SENATOR : The testimony of Professor Hill in the morning was flat out perjury. 3rd SENATOR : I 've got statements from her former law professors, statements from people that know her, statements from Tulsa, Oklahoma saying watch out for this woman @!SCHADLER voice-over These were the founding fathers of Braun 's rise to prominence. 4th SENATOR : This is not too bad, " women 's large breasts. " That 's a word we use all the time @!SCHADLER voice-over When the Senate began its Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill hearings last fall, Braun was still just a low-profile Chicago politician, Cook County Recorder of Deeds. Ms. BRAUN : And the phone calls started coming. " We think you should run for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it was. They did n't like what they saw. The Senate demystified itself in the eyes of the people @!SCHADLER voice- over Look who 's embracing her now, the same state Democratic Party leaders who once dismissed her candidacy now would n't miss paying their humble respects. Who wants to be on the wrong side of history? If you walk Carol Moseley Braun back into her own history, here is as good a place to begin as any, in the neighborhood where, as a seven-year-old, her best friend was the white girl who lived next door. Ms. BRAUN : And you can see the bedroom windows kind of face each other @!SCHADLER Right down here? Ms. BRAUN : Uh-huh, can you see? SCHADLER : Uh-huh. voice-over At night, after the two chattered across the alley, her friend was sometimes punished by her parents for talking to that black girl next door. interviewing Do you recall how that made you feel? Ms. BRAUN : I felt sorry for her. I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one getting spanked. I was just, you know, like, you know, it was like I did n't see myself as being the problem. Racism, sexism, you name the -isms, and they 're all manifestations of the same evil. I rejected it just as much as I rejected the notion that because I was a girl I could n't stow away on a tramp steamer if I wanted to, or go explore the Amazon if I wanted to @!SCHADLER So, you were already a feminist when you were 10 years old? Ms. BRAUN : I did n't know that. We did n't call it that, but yeah @!SCHADLER voice-over This is the Chicago where Carol Moseley grew up with her working parents, two brothers and a sister, she spent her early years on the city 's south side. Ms. BRAUN : My mother was solid, solid, you know, and she was an inspiration also, precisely, I guess, because she was always, you know, she just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which was? Ms. BRAUN : Raise her four children @!SCHADLER Tell me about your dad. Ms. BRAUN : My dad was a complex man, yeah @!SCHADLER voice-over Joseph Moseley was a Chicago cop by day, and a musician by night, playing saxophone in the city 's jazz bars of the 1950 's. Ms. BRAUN : Sitting in a restaurant, yesterday, and the pianist played the first number that was kind of wafting in the air was Clair de Lune, which he used to play all the time when he was in a good mood, played it all the time @!SCHADLER voice-over But there was another side to Joseph Moseley known only to his family, and the same man who made music, abused his children. Ms. BRAUN : You know, I 'd run to my grandmother 's house @!SCHADLER Tell her what happened? Ms. BRAUN : Yeah, yeah @!SCHADLER If dad got violent, you went to Grandma 's? Ms. BRAUN : Right, right @!SCHADLER Do you remember physically being hurt? Ms. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Ms. BRAUN : Oh, come on, come on. This is very embarrassing to talk about. It really is. My father was very- was violent, and he would get that way unexpectedly sometimes, and he would beat us with ropes, and wave guns at us, and you know, his fists sometimes. He was just, you know, he was an abusive person in that regard, and that was the downside. That was the ugly side @!SCHADLER voice-over By the time Braun was a teenager, her father left home, and the family broke apart. Ms. BRAUN : That was a terrible time for me. My parents had just gotten divorced. My grandmother way dying. We were moving from you know, almost suburbia to a very tough neighborhood, very tough neighborhood @!SCHADLER How tough? Ms. BRAUN : As tough as they get, as tough as they get. I did n't get shot or stabbed or anything. You know, so lucky breaks @!SCHADLER voice-over In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood. " We took her back to the place and the time. Gage Park, Chicago, and Martin Luther King had come to stage a civil rights protest here for public housing. The young Carol Braun was among those joining the march. Ms. BRAUN : They were throwing rocks and bottles at him, and I remember being on my knees with my hands over my head as Dr. King got hit. That, for me, was a defining moment, and really kept me from, because you know, those were the ' 60s, and it would have been just as easy for me to get into hating people @!SCHADLER voice-over By the early ' 70s, the politics of the Black Panthers, and the banner of Black Power were flying high, but Braun had rejected militancy in favor of the mainstream. At the University of Chicago Law School, she met her former husband, Michael Braun. interviewing Some blacks criticized you for betraying your race when you married a white man. True? Ms. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, you marry who you love, and the whole idea is that you 're supposed to be able to love people of all sorts, and so I do n't have you know, I did n't even- I say I do n't brook much foolishness. To me that 's just what that was, and my attitude was who I marry is nobody 's business but mine @!SCHADLER voice-over With a law degree and a young son, Braun began her political career in the integrated neighborhood of Hyde Park. The family lived just around the corner from Barney 's Butcher Shop. Ms. BRAUN : Hi, how are you. Good, good, how are you? SCHADLER : voice- over Where she bought meat and first shopped for votes. BARNEY 'S MEATS EMPLOYEE : Well, I remember you said you were here, and I think the first time down here you said, " Oh, I plan on running for State Representative. I said, well, good luck. She probably wo n't win. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next 10 years in the Illinois State House, building a reputation as a textbook liberal supporting Affirmative Action and increased government spending on education and public assistance programs. interviewing What 's your stand on abortion? Ms. BRAUN : I 'm adamantly pro-choice @!SCHADLER Personally, how about personally? Ms. BRAUN : Personally I do n't believe in abortion. I 'm adamantly pro-choice, however, because I think it is an issue for women that is as basic as freedom from slavery. RICH WILLIAMSON : I think the contrast between my opponent and I,, substantively, is probably as great as any Senate race in Illinois in decades @!SCHADLER voice-over Rich Williamson is Braun 's Republican opponent. Much to the anger of his conservative supporters, he reversed himself on abortion, and is now pro-choice, but it 's perhaps the only political position Williamson and Braun have in common. interviewing Your campaign literature says this campaign is about change. What could be a greater change than having a black woman in the United States Senate? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I don't- I hope no one votes for Rich Williamson or against him because I 'm a white male @!SCHADLER voice-over In a perfect world, that might be true, but this campaign is marked by gender and race. Don Rose has been a political consultant in Chicago for 20 years. DON ROSE : We have a history of racial voting in Illinois. She could lose eight to 10 points because she is black @!SCHADLER But nobody is talking about that? Mr. ROSE : Nobody talks about the racial issue because the first one who raises it, obviously, is going to be accused of being political, but nobody has to talk about it. It 's there @!ACTRESS TV commercial Who is Carol Moseley Braun? She was Harold Washington 's voice as a State Legislator in Springfield, and she was a Jesse Jackson delegate to the National Convention @!SCHADLER voice-over Williamson launched his campaign with a radio ad linking Braun to the liberal legacies of Chicago 's two most famous black politicians. If the strategy lacks subtlety, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it. interviewing What do you think of Jesse Jackson? Ms. BRAUN : What do I think of Jesse? Jesse is a gifted man, is n't he? Brilliant @!SCHADLER Would you want him campaigning for you? Ms. BRAUN : I do n't think it 's necessary for him to do that @!SCHADLER That sounds like you definitely would not be placing a telephone call to Jesse Jackson saying come out here and help me. Ms. BRAUN : Whenever I get the Jesse question, Jesse, and- the Reverend Jackson question, which are one and the same, and they ask it, wait a minute, you know, give me a chance to have a voice. Give me and you might discover that I 've got something to add to the debate @!SCHADLER So, what does the schedule look like today? Ms. BRAUN : See, here 's the problem @!SCHADLER Personal. Ms. BRAUN : I have n't packed, and I 've got to go to Collinsville tonight @!SCHADLER voice-over In transforming herself from a local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what she 's never done before, campaign around the clock, and raise money around the country. CAMPAIGN SPOKESPERSON : We have in hand, right now, $65,157 @!SCHADLER voice-over With the national spotlight now on her, money is flooding in, and not just from women 's groups who once were her only true believers. Ms. BRAUN : With this fundraising being successful as it is, I kind of feel like Scarlett in Gone With the Wind, you know, " As God is my witness, I will not go hungry again. " I feel like I wo n't have to go hungry again. I could n't get phone calls returned. I could n't get media coverage. We called a press conference, nobody would show up. I mean we went through that, and so- SCHADLER : Now you ca n't get rid of us. You 'd like to, I know. Ms. BRAUN : It 's that old expression, " Be careful what you pray for, you might get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate? Ms. BRAUN : Oh, absolutely, absolutely @!SCHADLER Watch it, you might get it. Ms. BRAUN : I have had some very tough times, and I 've come through them, and I 've come through them sane, normal, still connected, and the reason I 've been able to come through them is because of my abiding faith that the Creator has a master plan, and I 'm part of it @!SAWYER The most recent polls show Carol Moseley Braun leading Rich Williamson 55 percent to 20 percent, with 25 percent undecided. Commercial break DONALDSON : There it was this week in big black letters for the whole country to see, the cover of " Newsweek " magazine with a picture of Ross Perot and the headline " The Quitter. " Well, take heart Mr. Perot. At least you 're not alone, but what puzzled us and Chief Correspondent Chris Wallace, is just why, when the going gets tough, some of the tough throw in the towel.

RICHARD NIXON : November 7, 1992 You do n't have Nixon to kick around anymore @!WALLACE voice- over Richard Nixon lashed out at the press in 1962, and promised he was done with politics forever. That turned out to be another pledge he did not honor. By 1968, Nixon was back, only to quit in disgrace one step ahead of impeachment. Pres. NIXON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective at noon tomorrow @!WALLACE voice-over Sometimes, one man can make another back down. Roberto Duran was the fiercest fighter of his day, the man with the hands of stone, but in 1980, his backbone turned to Jello. Halfway through the fight, he just quit. " No mas, " he said, " No more. " GRETA GARBO : " Grand Hotel, " MGM/UA I want to be alone @!WALLACE voice- over Sometimes, as with Greta Garbo, people quit at the peak of their fame, and settle happily into complete privacy, but not most.
