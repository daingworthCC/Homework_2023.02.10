235741 DANIEL ZWERDLING, Host : In the bloody saga of the race to save Africa 's elephants, you wo n't find a more remarkable story than what 's happened in the East African nation of Kenya. Only 20 years ago, Kenya had around 70,000 elephants. By the late 1980s, more than two-thirds of them had died. Poachers were roaming the countryside, unchecked. The nation symbolized the slaughter of Africa 's wildlife. But then, Kenya 's current president hired an unlikely man to wage war on the poachers. His name is Richard Leakey. He is the son of the famous anthropologists who dug up some of humankind 's earliest bones. He 's a famous fossil finder, himself, and over the past few years, Richard Leakey has proved that poachers can be stopped, elephants can be saved. When he took the job in 1989, thousands of elephants were being killed every year. Last year, less than 100 were shot. Then a few months ago, the story of Richard Leakey took a surprising and troubling turn. When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leakey said, ' No, ' he ca n't talk on the phone, it 's being tapped. But this past week, Leakey flew to New York and he said he 'd feel safe telling the story in his hotel room in this country. Hope you do n't mind the baggage. We sort of thought we 'd move in with you. Hi, I 'm Daniel Zwerdling. Leakey told me that when he took the anti-poaching job, the Kenyan government was doing virtually nothing to stop poaching. RICHARD LEAKEY, Fmr. Head of Kenya Wildlife Dept. : Well there were n't any anti-poaching squads, as such. There was a thing called the anti-poaching force, an anti-poaching unit, but it was grounded. People had no equipment unintelligible, no mobile vehicles that could have gone anywhere at any time @!ZWERDLING Seriously? So, the anti-poaching squad did n't even have a Land Rover, some sort of vehicle? Mr. LEAKEY : Well, crosstalk vehicle, but it was- I would n't have gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I mean, they were pretty beat up. Similarly, the vehicles had no spare parts- a lot of unpaid bills and it was a pretty sad situation in which there was very little prospect of being able to really look forward very far @!ZWERDLING And wildlife researchers give me two explanations for why things were so ghastly. One is that Kenya was, and still is, a third world country and third world countries simply do not have much money to keep drugs in their hospitals, let alone fight poachers. Another reason, people have said to me in private, is that some of the top political figures in Kenya, including the first president, the current president, President Moi, and their families and friends were involved in the- in the ivory trade and profited from poaching. Is that true? Mr. LEAKEY : Well, since I took the job in 1989 and left it in 1994, I do n't think I came across any evidence that the present president was involved in poaching or commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be said for the previous regime, but by the time I got there, they had certainly ceased to be involved. I think the greatest problem was that the wildlife department, itself, was totally corrupted and many of the people charged with the task of looking after wildlife were, in fact, exploiting it @!ZWERDLING So, the statistics, in a way, speak for themselves. Since you took over the wildlife department, the number of elephants being killed in Kenya has dropped dramatically. I mean it 's an international success story. Analyzing how that happened, what were the major ingredients? What worked? Mr. LEAKEY : Well, I do n't think it was one thing. I think there were several things. I think the very obvious and clearly stated political support that I received from the president to put a stop to poaching was recognized within Kenya and beyond. I was able to use that to create a very strong and new work attitude within the organization @!ZWERDLING What do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and people were- were certainly persuaded that if they did work, they would be recognized and be supported and there would no interference. There would be no personal cost to them if they maintained a tough stance in prosecuting the law, if you like @!ZWERDLING So you mean in the past, when government officials tried to go after poachers legally, they would actually be punished for going after the poachers. Mr. LEAKEY : Yes. There was a great deal of interference from local and national politicians. Prosecutions were often stopped before they got to court. People were released. People were transferred or fired if they were too rigorous in the application of the law and so there was a very bad morale. By being able to get that high level support and, certainly I think linked to that, the support was extended to enable me to fire a large number of people who were clearly involved in the misdoings of the past @!ZWERDLING Actually, I have heard that you fired 300, 400, more? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4,000, I sacked about 2,300, so it was over 50 percent of the workforce @!ZWERDLING Oh, more than 2,000. Mr. LEAKEY : And that had a very dramatic impact on people 's attitudes to the job they had to do @!ZWERDLING Uh-huh. What other things? I mean, tell me about weapons, equipment. Mr. LEAKEY : Well, we very quickly rearmed the units dealing with poachers, gave them semi-automatic weapons to replace weapons that had first seen service before the first world war in 1914 @!ZWERDLING Before the first world war, seriously? Mr. LEAKEY : And, if you are facing men carrying AK-47s, with a bolt-action 1900 rifle, you do n't feel particularly secure and so that was a necessary action @!ZWERDLING laughs I guess I should n't laugh, really. Mr. LEAKEY : We gave them vehicles that worked, that started when they needed to start and continued to drive until you wanted them to stop. We gave them air support and this made an enormous difference to morale @!ZWERDLING You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one point, in Kenya, a member of the park service, who said he really liked you and when I asked, you know, what is it about Richard Leakey that you like, he said, ' He 's given us new uniforms. ' Mr. LEAKEY : Well, I think uniforms are very important and I think anyone who 's worked in the armed services will be aware that a uniform is something very important and we changed the uniform. We discarded the rags and the uniform of the administration that had been in place when I took over, changed the color, changed the fatigues, changed the dress code. And so people were working for something that worked, as opposed to continuing to work for something that was perceived to have been a national failure. And I think that had a very dramatic impact on people 's attitudes to the job they had to do @!ZWERDLING And now- there was a second part of your strategy, in addition to arming the anti-poaching squads, giving them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shoot-to-kill order. If you see poachers, you can shoot to kill them. Mr. LEAKEY : We only shot when shot at. People carrying AK-47s and grenade launchers and hand grenades in pursuit of their business usually shoot when challenged by forces of the law and it would be very rare if you were carrying an AK-47 in a national park because you were hunting elephant and somebody in a wildlife uniform said, ' Hey, I 'm going to talk to you, ' that you would come over and hand him your rifle. The chances are you would be shot at and we had some very serious engagements and I think it was also very important - the price of ivory, which had been very high in the ' 80s, began to fall quite quickly as a result of the publicity campaign that we launched shortly after I took over @!ZWERDLING Um-hum and, of course there was the worldwide ivory ban in 1989. Mr. LEAKEY : People stopped buying it and once ivory was n't being bought, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $30 a pound in Kenya to less than $4 a pound. And $4 a pound for ivory that has to be taken with an increased deterrent around it is not an attractive proposition. There are other ways to make money and people moved on to do other things @!ZWERDLING So, as you close this part of your many careers and go on to the next one- Mr. LEAKEY : I think I 've demonstrated to my own satisfaction that a totally corrupt sector, where crime and corruption were hand-in-hand, can be turned around relatively easily by fairly modest leadership. If you can do that in five years in the wildlife sector in Kenya. You can certainly do it in Kenya. You can certainly do it anywhere. It can be done. Whether it can be done in time and everywhere remains to be seen, but what need now to do is energize and activate on a much larger scale. We 've got to look- not look at a single sector, but we 've got to look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomorrow, Richard Leakey on why his success has made enemies and why some of Kenya 's leaders recently forced him to quit..
