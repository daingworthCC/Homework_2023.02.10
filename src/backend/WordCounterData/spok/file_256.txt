Hello, everybody. How are you? I was just taken by the front row from Mississippi from the hub city. Southern Miss to the top. Southern Miss to the top. @1LARA-SPENCER-ABC-NE@3 : @5OC@6 You should have seen this dancing. @1ROBIN-ROBERTS-ABC-N@3 : @5OC@6 Oh, you were dancing? @1LARA-SPENCER-ABC-NE@3 : @5OC@6 Oh, you should have seen this whole place. Tom had this place going. @1ROBIN-ROBERTS-ABC-N@3 : @5OC@6 And he 's got a suit on today. Thank you, Tom, for @5Inaudible@6. @1MICHAEL-STRAHAN-ABC@3 : @5OC@6 You look great today. @1LARA-SPENCER-ABC-NE@3 : @5OC@6 The best part. Yes, these two were busting a move to sexy and I know it. @1MICHAEL-STRAHAN-ABC@3 : @5OC@6 Do we have it on tape? @1LARA-SPENCER-ABC-NE@3 : @5OC@6 No, but there is another commercial break coming. @1ROBIN-ROBERTS-ABC-N@3 : @5OC@6 Encore. @1LARA-SPENCER-ABC-NE@3 : @5OC@6 Yes. @1ROBIN-ROBERTS-ABC-N@3 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes, let 's do it. Good morning. Hi, everybody, good morning to you. Tom, got to give it to you, looking great today. And good morning to you. @1LARA-SPENCER-ABC-NE@3 : @5VO@6 We begin with Queen Elizabeth. Well, she has never wavered in her fashion sense, right? But that did n't stop her from checking out the shows in London. Her majesty making her fashion week debut on Tuesday, sitting next to the grand dame of all things stylish, " Vogue " editor in chief Anna Wintour at the British designer Richard Quinn 's runway show. After which the 91-year-young monarch presenting Richard with the inaugural Queen Elizabeth Award for British Design. Twenty-eight-year-old Quinn, known for his eccentric and structural pieces favored by the likes of Lady Gaga and the Queen. @1MICHAEL-STRAHAN-ABC@3 : @5OC@6 Hallelujah, 28 years old from the Queen. @1ROBIN-ROBERTS-ABC-N@3 : @5OC@6 Wow. @1LARA-SPENCER-ABC-NE@3 : @5OC@6 Twenty-eight years old. @1MICHAEL-STRAHAN-ABC@3 : @5OC@6 Twenty-eight. @1LARA-SPENCER-ABC-NE@3 : @5OC@6 Winning that inaugural award. @1ROBIN-ROBERTS-ABC-N@3 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lady Gaga share a little something? Also in " Pop News " this morning, do not mess with the US curling team. @1LARA-SPENCER-ABC-NE@3 : @5VO@6 You thought it was all just pushing, sweeping, but you can only push to a point or they 'll sweep you right under the carpet. Actress Kirstie Alley found that out the hard way when she declared on Twitter that she did n't mean to be mean, but watching curling was boring. Well, guess what, Kirstie, the curling team did n't really appreciate that little comment. @1GEORGE-STEPHANOPOULO@3 : @5VO@6 Neither did they back here. @1LARA-SPENCER-ABC-NE@3 : @5VO@6 They tweeted back to Alley, who starred in the " Look Who 's Talking " movies, writing, excuse me, " We 're not trying to be mean either, but your movies were n't exactly riveting theater. " @1LARA-SPENCER-ABC-NE@3 : @5OC@6 What? Drop the curling thing, drop the stone. @1ROBIN-ROBERTS-ABC-N@3 : @5OC@6 @5Inaudible@6. @1MICHAEL-STRAHAN-ABC@3 : @5OC@6 Nice, you know you have to sip some tea on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point, Kirstie, and she knows it. She backed down, she wrote, " Okay, I 'm gon na give it another chance. My son loves watching Team USA. " @1LARA-SPENCER-ABC-NE@3 : @5VO@6 And they responded, " We knew you 'd come around. Allow us or our good friends at @HollywoodCurl to show you and your son the ropes sometime and maybe they 'll even try watching " Veronica 's Closet. " @1LARA-SPENCER-ABC-NE@3 : @5OC@6 So, it will all work out, right? Watch a couple of movies, do a little curling. @1MICHAEL-STRAHAN-ABC@3 : @5OC@6 No, I appreciate, I do n't think you need to be doping for curling. @1ROBIN-ROBERTS-ABC-N@3 : @5OC@6 Okay. @1LARA-SPENCER-ABC-NE@3 : @5OC@6 I actually think it 's really hard. Those stones weigh a lot. @1MICHAEL-STRAHAN-ABC@3 : @5OC@6 Okay, there are n't... @1GEORGE-STEPHANOPOULO@3 : @5OC@6 You 're pushing them. @1MICHAEL-STRAHAN-ABC@3 : @5OC@6 I appreciate it. I think it 's amazing. @1LARA-SPENCER-ABC-NE@3 : @5OC@6 Takes a lot of work. @1MICHAEL-STRAHAN-ABC@3 : @5OC@6 Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not messing with you. @1ROBIN-ROBERTS-ABC-N@3 : @5OC@6 Not at all. @1LARA-SPENCER-ABC-NE@3 : @5OC@6 Kirstie found out the hard way. I 'm not going there. @1ROBIN-ROBERTS-ABC-N@3 : @5OC@6 No. @1LARA-SPENCER-ABC-NE@3 : @5OC@6 And now, guys, how about a lost and founding father story. @1LARA-SPENCER-ABC-NE@3 : @5VO@6 A lock of hair believed to have come from the head of none other than George Washington discovered in an envelope labeled Washington 's hair written in 18th century cursive, tucked inside a book in the library of Union College. Another clue here, that book a 1793 almanac that belonged to Eliza Hamilton 's father. Eliza, of course, the wife of Alexander Hamilton. And thank you, by the way, to Lin-Manuel Miranda for @5Inaudible@6 we all know this. @1GEORGE-STEPHANOPOULO@3 : @5VO@6 Yeah, we all know this. Right. @1LARA-SPENCER-ABC-NE@3 : @5OC@6 He of course is the right-hand man to General Washington. But it may have to just remain hair-say. @1LARA-SPENCER-ABC-NE@3 : @5VO@6 Scientists say DNA testing, thank you very much. Try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing could destroy the centuries-old follicle altogether and they just do n't wan na take the chance at this time. They 're hoping that science will improve and they 'll be able to save the follicle. @1LARA-SPENCER-ABC-NE@3 : @5OC@6 But here 's a little fun fact for you guys. Contrary to popular belief, George Washington did not wear a wig. I found out this morning that his hair was all, that was all his in all those paintings. He was actually a red head, though. He powdered his hair white because that was the look in the time of the 1700s when he was... @1ROBIN-ROBERTS-ABC-N@3 : @5OC@6 He @5Inaudible@6 that? @1LARA-SPENCER-ABC-NE@3 : @5OC@6 He was just working it, people. Work it. @1MICHAEL-STRAHAN-ABC@3 : @5OC@6 That 's a lot of work. But you know what I 'm thinking too? Nobody looked in that book for a long time. @1LARA-SPENCER-ABC-NE@3 : @5OC@6 No. No. It 's obviously not a good read. @1GEORGE-STEPHANOPOULO@3 : @5OC@6 Hiding in plain sight, George Washington 's hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll keep you posted on that. @1MICHAEL-STRAHAN-ABC@3 : @5OC@6 Lara, thank you, thank you. Great " Pop News, " as always.
