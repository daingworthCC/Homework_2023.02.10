247341 Liane Hansen, host : This is " Weekend Edition. " I 'm Liane Hansen. Neil Stammer( Owner, Juggling Capital) : Yes. My name is Neil Stammer. I am here in Washington, DC, at the Juggling Capital. It 's the first juggle shop in the country. We just opened up in the old post office pavillion right between the White House and the Capitol Building and I 'm a circu -- a former circus performer. I just got tired of living out of a suitcase so I opened up a juggling shop. Hansen : Neil Stammer, 25 years old, a native of Yuma, Arizona, has been juggling for a living since he was 12. He left home, became a street performer and eventually moved to Europe, where he became a celebrity. Stammer : The general attitude of circus arts in Europe is different. Juggling is considered a fine art there. And typically in Germany their shows are -- you know, yuppies will dress up. They 'll put on their tuxedoes and get a bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something unthinkable here. But that is changing. You have a lot of wonderful new shows and a lot of new talent coming out, so the entire attitude towards circus arts is changing in America, and that 's why we -- we 're here. Hansen : What 's the attraction? I mean, admit it, there 's something a little bit absurd about trying to keep seven balls in the air. Stammer : Yes, it -- it 's the very absurdity that 's the attraction. See, people like absurdity. This is one of the few things in -- one of the few activities you can do that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever and it 's -- and it 's not harmful. You know, it 's -- it 's very good for your health, it 's good for your thinking and mostly it 's very relaxing. Hansen : Do you find you get a lot of kind of button-down people who when they arrive here all of sudden transform themselves into something else? Stammer : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here. We -- well, we have Southern Baptist preachers come in with -- with all their children and they -- they 'd say, ' Oh, yeah I can do that. ' And they start juggling away and they loosen up their ties. They take off their jackets and they go at it. Appropriately enough, we 're -- we 're right across the street here from the headquarters of the IRS, so we 're getting a lot of people from the Internal Revenue Service coming over here juggling on their lunch break. I guess they have to keep in practice. Many people from the FBI come over. The same thing. It 's such a good stress reliever. The people come over and they just take off their jackets and, you know, have a good time. It 's really nice to see. Hansen : Neil and his business partner, David Gripp, want their store to carry at least one of every juggling prop made in the world. Today they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as how-to books and videos. Even unicycles. David is stationed at the cash register, while Neil gives gentle encouragement to an aspiring juggler. All right, now in all fairness I have learned how to juggle three balls. Stammer : OK. Well, let 's see how... Hansen : I 'll show you what I can do. Stammer : Let -- let 's demonstrate this. This is a great ball for the radio. These are called thuds. They import them from England, and everyone asks why do we call them thuds? Can you put the microphone near the ground. This is why? That is a thud. And le -- let 's see you juggle. Hansen : All right. I have to get -- almost. Stammer : OK. OK. You -- you 're keeping your hands a little high right now and you 're -- you 're going too fast. Juggling is a good way to relax because juggling forces you to relax. Hansen : OK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- have the problem of tensing up when they 're making a mistake. Juggling teaches you to do just the opposite. If something 's going wrong, you just have relax with it. When I started juggling listen to old blues records. What I try to do when I juggle now is I -- I try and imitate the same rhythms I learned from blues and I juggle that way, and if I 'm having trouble -- if I 'm ever juggling something without music I have to hear the music in my head or I ca n't -- I ca n't perform. It 's impossible for me to juggle now without hearing music in my head. And even when I 'm learning new tricks -- you -- you listen. This is just the sounds balls hitting my hands -- the thuds once again. I tend to use the sense of sound much more than the sense of sight, actually. It 's a combination of feel and sound. I do n't even have to look when I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. By hearing the balls and how they 're hitting my hands I know exactly where everything is. It 's much too fast to do it visually, but some how it works rhythmically. Hansen : So you 're not wat -- you 're listening as you do it. Stammer : Exactly. Once I -- I taught a boy how to juggle. He was 14 years old. It took about three or four days. He was completely blind from the age of three, and I stood behind him and there 's another prop called juggling scarves. They -- they float. You ca n't hear them on the radio. They float very lightly and very slowly, and there 's a lot to grab onto. So I stood behind him. He held onto my wrist and felt the motion of the juggling. It took about three or four days, but eventually he could juggle three scarves. So juggling is more a tactile and and a -- an aural procedure than strictly a visual one, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast enough. It 's a matter of rhythm. Hansen : Neil Stammer, co-owner of the Juggling Capital, a store, here in Washington, devoted exclusively to juggling. Where are you from? Unidentified Child : Texas. Hansen : Texas. Are you visiting Washington? Child : No, I was from Texas, and now I from Louisiana. Hansen : You 've got scarves. Can you juggle those scarves? Child : Well, not very well, but I can juggle them a little bit. Hansen : Go ahead let 's see. Whoa! Bravo. Well done. Did you learn that here, or did you know how to do that before? Child : Our -- we learned that in our PE class. Hansen : Physical education. Child : Yeah. We had a whole circus unit week, and we did unicycles, juggling and rope skipping and everything like that.
