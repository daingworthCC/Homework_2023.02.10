4171541 @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# Good evening. I 'm Judy Woodruff. @!GWEN-IFILL# And I 'm Gwen Ifill. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# On the " NewsHour " tonight : the biggest test yet in the Midwest for both Republican and Democratic candidates, as voters in Michigan, along with three other states, decide. @!GWEN-IFILL# Also ahead this Tuesday : Vice President Joe Biden tries to mend relations with Israel, one day after Prime Minister Netanyahu canceled his trip to the U.S. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# Plus, a look at what Washington politicians could learn from smaller cities, and why communities in the so-called flyover states should n't be so easily dismissed. @!DEBORAH-FALLOWS, - " # When we touched down in some of these small communities, you would think, how can all this be going on here, and we never knew about any of it? @!GWEN-IFILL# All that and more on tonight 's " PBS NewsHour. " @(BREAK) @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# Four more states are having their say today in the presidential race of 2016. Front-runners in both parties, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, are working to pad their delegate leads, while rivals try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan is the day 's main attraction, and we will hear from a reporter on the scene after the news summary. @!GWEN-IFILL# In the day 's other news : An American tourist was killed and a dozen Israelis wounded in a fresh wave of Palestinian attacks. The tourist, identified as a Vanderbilt University student, died in Jaffa, where an assailant stabbed seven people, before being killed by police. Another Palestinian shot and wounded several people in Jerusalem. He, too, was killed, along with two others involved in stabbing incidents. We will take a closer look at the Israeli-Palestinian divide later in the program. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# Iran 's hard-line Revolutionary Guard has test-fired another round of ballistic missiles, challenging the United Nations and the United States. Iranian state TV today showed a medium-range missile being launched overnight. It said several others were fired in recent days. U.S. officials said that could violate a U.N. prohibition. @!JOSH-EARNEST, -Whit# There 's at least one specific United Nations Security Council resolution that could apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviewing the Iranian launch to assess whether it is necessary for this matter to be raised before the United Nations Security Council. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# The U.N. resolution warns against launching anything that can carry a nuclear warhead. In addition, the U.S. announced sanctions earlier this year after Iran launched a long-range missile last fall. @!GWEN-IFILL# South Korea today imposed new penalties on North Korea for recent nuclear and missile tests. The sanctions ban financial dealings with 40 individuals and 30 organizations with suspected links to the North 's weapons program. In Seoul, a top official also announced new rules designed to cut off traffic by sea. @!LEE-SUK-JOON, -Sout# We will strengthen sanctions on shipping related to North Korea. We will entirely ban foreign vessels that are stopped in a North Korean port within 180 days and we will also continue the measures prohibiting the vessels of third countries from sailing the sea route between South and North Korea. @!GWEN-IFILL# In a related development, South Korea 's spy agency accused North Korea of hacking the cell phones of dozens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Islamist group Al-Shabaab confirms the U.S. bombed one of its camps on Saturday, but it disputes claims that the strike killed 150 fighters. American officials say the coordinated drone and manned aircraft attacks hit a training site 120 miles north of Mogadishu. The Pentagon says it was aimed at preventing a large-scale attack by the militants. @!GWEN-IFILL# The European Union moved closer today to a deal to reverse the exodus of migrants from Turkey. In return, the Turks would get well over $6.5 billion in aid, among other things. Jonathan Rugman of Independent Television News reports from Greece, where growing numbers of migrants are stranded. @!JONATHAN-RUGMAN# There are now around 14,000 people living like this in Idomeni, and yet the Greek authorities are predicting even more will now rush to join them before any deal sealed with Turkey at the end of next week seals them out of Europe as well. Over 700 migrants came ashore on Greek islands this morning alone. These arrived on Lesbos, with many more on the way, adding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder Turkey 's offer to take them all back comes with strings attached, chiefly, that one Syrian should be granted asylum in Europe for every Syrian returned across this water. @!AHMET-DAVUTOGLU, -T# I want to make it clear, we are demanding fair burden-sharing for Syrian refugees. @!JONATHAN-RUGMAN# Then there are the unwritten demands. At least one person was killed today by rockets fired into Turkey from Syria, possibly by so-called Islamic State. Turkey expects not just sympathy, but support, above all in battling Kurdish militancy along this border. Human rights groups will bridle at that. Where are you from? @!TRAVELERS# Afghanistan. @!JONATHAN-RUGMAN# And they 're already bridling at the prospect of people like these Afghans we encountered in Lesbos yesterday being forcibly returned, because their legal rights to shelter are so few on the Turkish side. @!VINCENT-COCHETEL, -# An agreement that would be tantamount to a blanket return of any foreigners to a certain country is not consistent with European law, is not consistent with international law. Now, we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These migrants apparently set to become part of the biggest expulsion of people since Greece and Turkey were at war. @!GWEN-IFILL# More than one million people have flooded into the E.U. since early last year, mainly by way of Turkey. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# Several major corporate sponsors cut or suspended ties today with tennis star Maria Sharapova. The five-time Grand Slam winner admitted Monday that she tested positive for a newly banned drug at the Australian Open. The drug, meldonium, can improve endurance. Sharapova says she 's used it periodically over the past 10 years for various medical problems. @!GWEN-IFILL# And Wall Street gave ground after China announced its exports fell in February by the most in more than six years. The Dow Jones industrial average lost nearly 110 points to close at 16964. The Nasdaq fell 59 points, and the S&amp;P 500 slipped 22. Still to come on the " NewsHour " : how Michigan 's election affects the future of the presidential race ; a renewed effort for peace in Israel ; the launch of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans to jihad ; and much more. And now to politics. Four states are holding contests today, both parties in Mississippi and Michigan, plus Republican races in Idaho and Hawaii. On the campaign trail, Republican John Kasich was in Michigan, drumming up support for today 's primaries, while others, like Ted Cruz, turned their attention to states voting next week. @!GOV-JOHN-KASICH-( R# You know the whole country is watching Michigan now. The whole country is. @( CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) @!GOV-JOHN-KASICH# And what they 're wondering, what they 're wondering, is a guy who has labored in obscurity rising in this state? And can a positive message of hope, of opportunity, of confidence, of innovation, of youthfulness, can somebody with that message finally overcome the bad mood that we seem to have been in? @!SEN-TED-CRUZ-( R-TX# To all of you who are voting today in states across the country, who will be voting in a week, to all of the men and women here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates, I ask you, come join us. We welcome you with open arms. If you do n't want to see Donald Trump as the nominee, and if you do n't want to see Hillary Clinton as the president, which is the inevitable result of Donald Trump being the nominee, come join us. Let us stand together. @!GWEN-IFILL# The top prize for both parties tonight, Michigan. For some GOP candidates there, the fight for first is almost as meaningful as the fight for second place. And for more on that, we 're joined by Kathy Gray, political reporter for The Detroit Free Press. Kathy, thank you for joining us. In a nutshell, why is Michigan so important to these candidates? @!KATHY-GRAY, -The-De# Well, it propels them into the next states, Ohio, Florida, the big states on October( sic) 15. And all of them are hoping that they get some big numbers here so they have some momentum going into those states. @!GWEN-IFILL# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the early primary states. How is it going? How is it rolling through Michigan? @!KATHY-GRAY# Well, he has been here twice. He had big, big rallies in Michigan, and all the polls show him in the lead. But some of the polls in more recent days have had the race tightening up a little bit. John Kasich seems to be rising a little bit. Ted Cruz is in second place. Marco Rubio seems to be kind of dropping off the -- dropping off the slate. @!GWEN-IFILL# Some of the early exit polls which are coming out tonight suggest that voters in Michigan are just as -- are less angry than voters in, say, Mississippi, and that they are more mainstream perhaps. How does that translate? Or does that translate? Does that match up with what you have been seeing? @!KATHY-GRAY# Well, there is some anger out there, too. There are a lot of people who are either unemployed or underemployed. There 's a lot of wage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending has kind of resonated with people here in Michigan. But there are wide swathes of moderate voters, moderate Republican voters and independents in the state as well, and those are the folks who John Kasich is hoping to attract, and he 's been here almost nonstop for the past week. @!GWEN-IFILL# Let 's talk about Ohio Governor John Kasich, who is trying to make a dent in the Rust Belt somewhere. Did he benefit at all from that really raucous debate last week where everybody was throwing mud and he was kind of trying to rise above? @!KATHY-GRAY# he did. A lot of people that I have talked to, I have been at several of Kasich 's event here 's in Michigan, have said that they appreciated a person who is a little less blustery, a little less fiery. And he seemed to be kind of the grownup on the stage, and people in Michigan who were tuning in very much so to the debate in Detroit appreciated that. @!GWEN-IFILL# One of the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of early voters, people who cast their vote some time in the past, came out for Trump, but, in the end, the turn was toward other candidates, even though not enough to overtake the front-runner. How has early voting been in Michigan? @!KATHY-GRAY# It 's been huge. I just talked with the secretary of state 's office late this afternoon, and the absentee ballots are up by -- it 's going close to 200,000 more than in 2012. Early voting, we had a poll last week, shows that the early voting is benefiting both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton to a very large degree. So the voter turnout on today is going to be key for the rest of the candidates. @!GWEN-IFILL# You mentioned Hillary Clinton. It allows me to move to the Democrats. There 's been a lot of discussion about the situation in Flint, the poisoned, lead-taunted water in Flint, Michigan. And of course, there was a Democratic debate there recently. How has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Republican side? @!KATHY-GRAY# It 's really resonated on the Democratic side. Hillary Clinton was the first one in to call -- talk about it. She talked about it first at a debate way back in January. She came to -- she came to Flint in early February. She 's been pounding on it relentlessly for the past couple of months. Bernie Sanders has also been to Flint. He came and did a town hall meeting in Flint. And it is really resonating. It 's kind of a narrative of how inner cities, inner urban cities have been kind of left behind by Republican policies, and so they 're definitely playing big on that. Flint also has a very large African-American population, so both of the candidates have been trying to attract those voters as well. @!GWEN-IFILL# Let me try two numbers on you. This is on the Republican side, delegate -- adding up the delegates at stake. Fifteen percent is one number. Fifty percent is the other. Explain how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Republican side, we have 59 delegates at stake. You have to get at least 15 percent of the vote to get that. So there 's a very real possibility that one of the Republicans wo n't meet that threshold. On the Democratic side, you have to get -- it 's a winner -- it 's a not a winner-take-all. It 's proportional. There 's 130 delegates at stake, another 17 superdelegates. Those 130 are divided up proportionately. And we expect that both Clinton and Sanders will get some delegates out of Michigan. @!GWEN-IFILL# OK. Kathy Gray of The Detroit Free Press, thank you. Long night ahead. @!KATHY-GRAY# Thank you. @!GWEN-IFILL# Get the latest on the election online. Check in with our results page all night. That 's at PBS.org/NewsHour. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# We return to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and tonight begin a series of occasional conversations we 're calling The Long Divide. Vice President Joe Biden was in Israel today, not far from the scene of one stabbing attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Palestinian leaders mired in a deep and violent impasse. Biden is also the latest top American official trying to repair relations between the Obama White House and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. We launch this series now with New York Times foreign affairs columnist Thomas Friedman. Tom Friedman, welcome back to the program. @!THOMAS-FRIEDMAN, -T# Great to be with you, Judy. Thank you. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# So, you wrote a column saying flatly that the peace process is dead. Why do you believe that? @!THOMAS-FRIEDMAN# Because it 's dead. It 's actually been dead for a while. I just called it by its real name. It 's clear to me, Judy, that both sides have conspired. This was like " Murder on the Orient Express. " There were so many stab wounds in this body, hard to tell exactly which one was the fatal blow. But you now have near approaching 500,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, and depending on where you define the border. Remember, it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlers from Gaza. So, imagine if you 're talking about, you know, 400,000 to 500,000. And on the Palestinian side, you have had some really bad developments. In the last Israeli-Palestinian war, Hamas fired a rocket that landed basically on the outskirts of Israel 's only international airport, basically, or major international airport, Lod. And the U.S. FAA ordered for one day all American flights canceled. That was a message to all Israelis. Imagine if the Palestinians had the West Bank and could close their only airport. And, also, Salam Fayyad or the -- sorry -- the -- Abu Mazen, the Palestinian president, he released -- he fired, basically, Salam Fayyad, the one Palestinian prime minister who said, we need to build our institutions, and if we do what the Zionists did and we build our state institutionally, getting a state will just be a formality. He got fired. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# So, you 're saying there are a few people trying to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to? What 's the problem? @!THOMAS-FRIEDMAN# Yes. There are a lot of people trying to do the right -- wrong thing, and they have been really empowered lately. My criticism of Netanyahu is not that Israel should get out of the West Bank tomorrow. I get it. It 's a dangerous neighborhood. You know, I have always felt, to understand Israel, to write about Israel, you have to keep three thoughts in your head at the same time and their intention. One is that Israel is an amazing place. It 's really built an amazing society in its short history. Second, Israel does some bad stuff in the West Bank. And, third, Israel lives in a really dangerous neighborhood. And you have got to keep all three of those in your head at the same time. My critique of Netanyahu is this. Why would you make a bad situation worse by putting Jews in the middle of Palestinian areas in the West Bank, highly densely populated Palestinian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, that would have to be ceded to a Palestinian state? And where is the Israeli creativity? We see Israeli creativity in cyber, in technology, all of these things. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# Right. @!THOMAS-FRIEDMAN# When was the last time you read a story about Netanyahu where you said, wow, now, that 's really interesting, there 's a really creative idea? And on the Palestinian side, you have got a fractured Palestinian society, one in Gaza, one in the West Bank. So nobody can actually say yes for the Palestinians anymore in a unified way. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# In the meantime, you have American politicians, many Republican prominent politicians running for president who are praising Benjamin Netanyahu, saying Barack -- President Obama has been -- has made all the wrong moves when it comes to Israel. Is the U.S. a player or not? There 's a story today in The Wall Street Journal saying that the White House is trying to come up with a U.N. resolution maybe or some other gesture to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that story is a bit of an evergreen. Maybe it 's true now. But it 's always, we 're going to tell them. We 're just -- we 're going to tell them we 're tired of this. We 're going to -- and then it never happens, because a Democrat comes along, like Hillary Clinton, and says, geez, I wish you would n't do that. Now that 's going to affect Jewish voters. What 's going on in the campaign, that 's a gravity-free zone. It has nothing to do with the reality of the Middle East whatsoever. That is people looking for votes and funding. It has nothing to do with the region. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# How much of the problem here, Tom, is due to the fact that the rest Middle East is virtually on fire, overshadowing the Palestinians and the Israelis? @!THOMAS-FRIEDMAN# There 's no question. If you 're sitting in Israel today, Israel has a real strategic dilemma. It has nonstate actors dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on four out of five borders, Sinai, Gaza, Lebanon and Syria. we 're at a stage today where a lot of artificial states, states whose borders are primarily straight lines, they 're actually blowing up all over the world under the pressure of globalization, technology, climate. It 's different things in different places. These states, Judy, they 're like caravan homes in a trailer park. They 're built on slabs of cement with no basement and no foundation. And these big global forces today, they 're like a tornado going through a trailer park. And a lot of them happen to be around Israel. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# If solutions are out there, and the people who have tried to float them just get knocked down, where is an answer going to come from? You 're saying it waits for the next president. Does it wait even longer? And where does it? @!THOMAS-FRIEDMAN# You know, Netanyahu and Abbas can almost see each other from their offices. The idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state to come over, if they had the will, they would have the way. It 's got to start with them. the most constructive thing President Obama could do would -- say, we tried. It 's over. There 's going to be a one-state solution. That 's what would shock the system, not, here 's our plan. But then they just start making it about us. They start picking apart our plan. They say, it 's about you. It 's over. We really wish you well. Sorry it did n't work out, because what happens otherwise is Netanyahu will always say, Kerry 's coming. Kerry -- there 's a plan. Or Abbas will say, do n't worry. The Americans are -- no, no, nobody 's coming. It 's over. It 's yours. You own it. Now you live with it. And that 's the beginning of wisdom. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# But can any American president really do that, given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of been doing it for the last year. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# But he has n't made that declaration. @!THOMAS-FRIEDMAN# He has n't said that. But he 's basically -- he 's basically told Kerry, you know, I do n't want you messing around there anymore. So, it 's very hard, but, actually, it would be -- you know, friends do n't let friends drive drunk, and we have been letting a lot of people drive drunk. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# Tom Friedman, on that note, we thank you. @!THOMAS-FRIEDMAN# A pleasure, Judy. Thank you. @!GWEN-IFILL# This past Saturday, high school students preparing for college took a brand-new SAT test, with the first major changes in more than a decade. The scores will be part of many college applications, but not all. April Brown reports for our latest Tuesday evening Making the Grade series. It 's part of Public Media 's American Graduate Project. @!PATRICK-BOCK, -SAT-# So, we 're going to do quadratics today. We 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students like junior Carson Goettlicher of Annandale, Virginia, have set aside extra time preparing for a pre-college ritual, taking the ACT or the SAT test, or both. Carson has been studying with tutor Patrick Bock for the new SAT, the first major changes to the test since 2005. @!CARSON-GOETTLICHER# We took a pretest in the SAT class which was based off the old one. And I did pretty well on that, so I -- then I thought about how I 'm taking the new one, and I 'm like, I 'm going to do terrible now. @!APRIL-BROWN# There are many changes to the new version, including a focus on materials students are likely to find in college and careers. Some test prep professionals believe it now looks more like the ACT, which more students have taken in recent years, than the SAT. Anyone who has taken the old SAT might remember the arcane vocabulary that even the test creators admit engendered prodigious vexation. Those words are now gone, as is the penalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again 1,600. The essay is now optional. The test designers say the overhaul is meant to keep the SAT relevant. @!JAMES-MONTOYA, -Col# The old test was working, but this is a better test. @!APRIL-BROWN# James Montoya is a senior vice president at the College Board, which oversees the SATs. @!JAMES-MONTOYA# We focus on those skills that are most important, and evidence-based reading and writing is a great example. If we look at mathematics, one of the things that we look at, the importance of algebraic equations. @!APRIL-BROWN# Montoya says the test is also more closely aligned to what students are learning in school. Carson Goettlicher is take the SAT because the colleges she 's applying to require it, but since the 1970s, a growing number of colleges and universities have made their admissions test optional. Bates College, a liberal arts school in Maine, went test-optional in 1984. And North Carolina 's Wake Forest became one of the first major universities to do so in 2008. Last year, George Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest institutions in the country not requiring SAT or ACT scores during the application process. George Washington vice provost Laurie Coaler says test-optional was part of a plan to help improve diversity because studies have revealed first-generation college-goers, as well as minority and female students, are more likely to apply if they do n't have to provide standardized test scores. @!LAURIE-KOEHLER, -Vi# We did see a more than 28 percent increase in our applications, but what was striking was the numbers of first-generation students, of under-represented multicultural students who submitted applications, nearly 1,100 more in each of those populations. @!APRIL-BROWN# But before the decision was made, Koehler says, G.W. looked at research from Bates and consulted officials at Wake Forest about why standardized test results may not be the best predictor of college success. They found looking at high school work holistically and a student 's grade point average are better indicators. @!LAURIE-KOEHLER# If you have earned C 's in high school, and even if you test really well, you 're probably going to have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in college. @!ROBERT-SCHAEFFER, -# The changes to the SAT are largely cosmetic. They make it a little bit more consumer-friendly, but they do n't deal with any of the fundamentally flawed characteristics of the test. @!APRIL-BROWN# Robert Schaeffer of the National Center for Fair and Open Testing says there are now more than 850 colleges and universities nationwide on the test-optional bandwagon. @!ROBERT-SCHAEFFER# It remains a weak predictor of how well a student will do in college. It 's biased in many ways, and it 's susceptible to high-priced coaching. @!APRIL-BROWN# The coaching he refers to can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars an hour. Carson Goettlicher found her SAT tutor Patrick Bock through her school. It 's something Carson 's mother, Debbie, is thankful for. @!DEBBIE-GOETTLICHER# I 'm trying to prepare my kids for their future. And, unfortunately, they have to take this test in order for them to be successful. So, yes, I 'm going to give them every tool I can. We were fortunate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us, because it can get quite expensive. @!MAN# The SAT is changing in March 2016. Which SAT do you want to practice for? @!APRIL-BROWN# In anticipation of the new SAT, the College Board partnered with Khan Academy, a nonprofit online educational service, to provide free test prep. Founder Sal Khan says it 's a way to level the playing field for those who may not be able to afford extra help. @!SAL-KHAN, -The-Khan# The software in Khan Academy will immediately know where you are strong and where you are weak, so it can really do weak-point training. So, that 's one option. But the number one thing is not to pull an all-nighter the night before the exam. @!APRIL-BROWN# Tutor Patrick Bock and others have pointed out the new SAT comes at a time when the test has been losing market share to competitor ACT. @!PATRICK-BOCK# They can say that test changes are motivated by sort of closer alignment with state standards or sort of more rigorous analytics into the test, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, if you 're losing students every single year, you want to make that up. @!APRIL-BROWN# Nevertheless, on Saturday, tens of thousands of high school students around the country woke up early to take the new SAT. @!JACQUEZ-LYKES, -Stu# Honestly, I came in not knowing that it was a different test. @!APRIL-BROWN# Jacquez Lykes is a senior and took the test in Fairfax County, Virginia. Have you taken the SAT before? @!JACQUEZ-LYKES# Yes. I took it like three weeks ago. @!APRIL-BROWN# What was different on this new SAT vs. the old one you took? @!JACQUEZ-LYKES# The other version had 10 sections, and it felt like you were in the class for, like, hours or whatnot, and this one only had four, which was, like, a major relief. @!APRIL-BROWN# Junior Kayla Ramsay also took it. Do you feel like you were prepared for this? @!KAYLA-RAMSAY, -Stud# I do. Like, I did a lot of studying and just recalling stuff from freshman year, sophomore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after she finished. @!CARSON-GOETTLICHER# I 'm relieved. it felt like pretty much like any other standardized test, other than the fact that there 's -- this is basically our future. @!APRIL-BROWN# Carson is also taking the ACT next month and is planning to take the new SAT again in May. For the " PBS NewsHour, " I 'm April Brown in Fairfax County, Virginia. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# With all the noise on the campaign trail this year about what 's wrong with America, it caught our eye when journalist James and Deborah Fallows filed a report on places that seem to be getting things right, even across partisan divides. To find out more, I caught up with the Fallows in Greenville, South Carolina. This story is part of our collaboration with " The Atlantic " magazine. For the past three years, husband and wife journalists James and Deborah Fallows have been exploring parts of America sometimes referred to as flyover country, places often ignored by the East and West Coast news media. But instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and over again. @!DEBORAH-FALLOWS, - " # When we touched down in some of these small communities, you would think, how can all this be going on here, and we never knew about any of it? @!JAMES-FALLOWS, - " Th# The country is full of people doing things, which you would n't necessarily assume from the tone of political discourse or news coverage. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# In a search for places that have grappled with challenges, economic or political, the Fallows have made extended visits to about 25 cities for the project, including Greenville, South Carolina ; Burlington, Vermont ; Allentown, Pennsylvania ; Duluth, Minnesota ; Sioux Falls, South Dakota ; Redlands, California, and so many more. You found that there were a number of things that these cities have in common that make things work. @!JAMES-FALLOWS# You see across the country, there 's a surprising amount of the good bones of downtown that are still left that people are trying to use. You see, very crucially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divisive and so poisonous now, just do n't come into the local discourse. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# Why is having a downtown important? @!JAMES-FALLOWS# To a surprising degree, just the identity of this is a place where there 's a there there depends on having a downtown with restaurants and with not just a shopping mall. It was amazing to go see how many parts of the country are attracting really ambitious, really well- educated, really first-rate people who think that the best arena for their ambitions and their whole life prospect is someplace where they can do work of the very first tier, but also have some effect on the local community. The falls are a really nice way to link the past and the present. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# A prime example, Greenville, South Carolina. Once known for the textile industry, its mills lined the Reedy River in the heart of the city. Now the mills are long gone or repurposed, but the river remains at the center of the community, lined by hotels and restaurants, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magnet for tourists and locals alike. The evolution was no accident. @!KNOX-WHITE, -Mayor-# We reinvented the downtown, just as we reinvented the local economy. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# Knox White, mayor of Greenville for more than 20 years, and a chief architect of the city 's redevelopment, says city fathers set out decades ago to plan for the future. @!KNOX-WHITE# In the 1970s, when textiles were still very viable, the leadership in Greenville very intentionally decided that we needed to diversify. They brought in and recruited companies like General Electric, and today GE is a major presence here. And that put us in a really good stead, because, later, the textile industry would collapse. @!DEBORAH-FALLOWS# they 're very self-conscious about what they 're doing in Greenville and also aware that these things are n't going to be decreed from on high. @!NANCY-WHITWORTH, -D# It 's just in part of our DNA of how we operate. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# Remaking Greenville took government and business working together, says Nancy Whitworth, Greenville 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working together, the city and the county, you see that every day in sort of how we approach dealing with companies that we try to bring into Greenville. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# An active local government pushing incentives like tax breaks and favorable zoning have made so-called public-private partnerships possible, both in developing the downtown, and in luring major manufacturers to the area, like BMW and Michelin. These companies provide tens of thousands of jobs, and bring an international influence to this small Southern city. @!DANIELLE-VINSON, -F# It is definitely conservative, by and large. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# Danielle Vinson teaches political science at nearby Furman University. @!DANIELLE-VINSON# We have pockets of Democrats in the city limits particularly. But everywhere else is very Republican. And so our senators are Republican. Our -- all of our congressional delegation up here is Republican. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# Vinson says the government 's partnership with business may seem inconsistent with Republican philosophy, but it 's a way to make things work. @!DANIELLE-VINSON# When you start talking about ideology, it 's good in theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level. But when you get to the local city and county level, you have got tangible issues that have to be addressed. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# There 's no question Greenville 's economy is booming. Half-a-dozen cranes dot the skyline, as new hotels, condos and office buildings multiply. But some are asking if the benefits have reached all of Greenville 's residents, about 15 percent of whom are poor. How fast is gentrification happening here? @!CHANDRA-DILLARD-( D# It 's happening very rapidly, even in my neighborhood. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# Chandra Dillard is a Democratic state representative from Greenville. @!CHANDRA-DILLARD# I have received letters at my home saying, do you want to sell? There is pressure against the neighborhood. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# So how is the community dealing with that? @!CHANDRA-DILLARD# Well, you must be intentional, Judy. We must be intentional about making sure that people are trained, that they 're ready, that there is policy to protect people who currently live in these neighborhoods, so that they will be able to stay there. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this community, in the context of the history of this part of the state? @!CHANDRA-DILLARD# there is racial harmony in our city. Again, I believe the challenge now is economic disparity that separates us, and not the races. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# The congregation at Greenville 's Redemption Church would seem to confirm that. Sixty percent of its 20,000 members are African-American, the rest mainly white. Most of the whites are Republicans, most of the blacks Democrats. On politics, they disagree fiercely. But each Sunday, they worship as one. The reverend Ron Carpenter is their pastor. @!REV-RON-CARPENTER, # In our world, we call it a culture of honor. There is such a culture of disrespect that prevails in society, through media, through government, through politics, that I tell people that, no matter if you disagree with this person 's politics, whether or not you agree with their position, honor the person. @!JAMES-FALLOWS# It 's easier to treat that person as somebody who has good parts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you will try to contain those, where you can come to kind of practical solutions. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# One such solution addresses the education gap that keeps many African-Americans from sharing in the wealth of high-tech jobs in and around Greenville. At the Whittenberg Elementary School of Engineering -- you heard that right, elementary school -- these kids get a head start on math and science. @!DEBORAH-FALLOWS# These were the tiniest little engineers from pre-K through grade five. And they were starting off in technology and engineering infused into their baby curriculum. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# And the South Carolina Governor 's School for the Arts and Humanities, a public boarding school, gives high school students from across the state an opportunity to pursue excellence. Still, much work remains to spread the new opportunities and benefits among all of Greenville 's residents. And much of that work falls to the church. @!REV-RON-CARPENTER# What I do is, I usually try to bring businesses and bring our government officials to the table and say, I ca n't take care of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care issue if we can get the Greenville transit system operating in this community, too. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# In Greenville and in so many other cities the Fallows visited, they found pockets of genuine optimism in a nation that often seems filled with fear and loathing. @!JAMES-FALLOWS# They have a shared story about the way that the city government works to bring in some international corporations, works with local start-ups, works with the diversity of the community there, works with religious organizations, and having some collective sense that it matters to us to make this city attractive, make it inclusive, make it growing, make it strong. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# And did you see anything that could be transplanted to Washington? @!JAMES-FALLOWS# In contrast to the apparent hopelessness of the national perspective, there is some attempt to grapple with these things locally. we came across almost nothing you could directly say, OK, the Greenville City Council works this way. Why does n't the U.S. Senate work this way too? But, in the meantime, people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Central Oregon and all the rest can learn from what each other are doing, and get greater strength from that sense of network. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# And so James and Deborah Fallows continue their journey, in the belief that these places and others like them are the real story of America today, even more than what 's going on in Washington. @!GWEN-IFILL# We will be back to talk with journalist Peter Bergen about his new book, " The United States of Jihad. " But, first, take this moment to hear from your local PBS station. It 's a chance to offer your support, which helps keep programs like ours on the air. @(BREAK) @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# Now the newest addition to the " NewsHour " Bookshelf, a look at Americans inspired by radical jihadism. Margaret Warner has that. @!MARGARET-WARNER# Terrorism expert Peter Bergen has spent two years studying hundreds of radicalized Americans, seeking to understand what drives a minority of U.S. Muslims to wage terror attacks against their fellow citizens. He also takes a hard look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this danger. The result is his new book, " The United States of Jihad : Investigating America 's Homegrown Terrorists. " It 's being released, along with an HBO documentary based on it, " Homegrown : The Counter-Terror Dilemma. " Peter Bergen, welcome. So, how big a threat is this, this homegrown terrorism? @!PETER-BERGEN, -Auth# Investigating America 's Homegrown Terrorists " : Well, it 's a persistent low-level threat. We have been in the United States quite lucky ; 45 Americans have been killed by jihadi terrorists in the United States, all by homegrown militants, since 9/11. Each one of those deaths, of course, is a tragedy, but it 's not a national catastrophe anything on the scale of 9/11. So, to some degree, the threat has been managed, but it will persist at a low level for a long time. @!MARGARET-WARNER# Was there one thing you found in your reporting that united all these cases, where you have an American Muslim who decides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the things that 's striking is they 're overwhelmingly Americans. They 're not foreigners coming into this country to do terrorist attacks. They tend to be middle class, average income, similar to the average American. They tend to be as well-educated as the average American. A third are married. A third are kids, average age 29. These are not the young hotheads of popular imagination. And, in fact, if you look at the San Bernardino case, which, of course, the most lethal terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11, they were married. They had a child. The guy was earning $70,000 a year. They were basically living the American dream. So, it 's a big puzzle. Why would you then kill your fellow Americans? And I ca n't say, even after two-and-a-half years ' study, that I can answer that question. I try, but each case is individual. @!MARGARET-WARNER# Yes. So, let 's take a couple of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young man named Carlos Bledsoe, African- American, from a conservative Christian upbringing, shoots and kills a U.S. soldier at a military recruiting base in Little Rock. It seems so unlikely. @!PETER-BERGEN# He was typical in the sense that he comes from a relatively prosperous family in Memphis. He went to college. He dropped out. He adopted a very fundamentalist form of Islam. He decided to go to Yemen, which is a hotbed of jihadism. He seems to have got radicalized there in prison, came back, and killed an American soldier. He said in court to the judge that, you know, he was guilty, he was sort of objecting to American foreign policy. Now, is that an adequate excuse? Of course not, because lots of people do n't like American foreign policy. They do n't kill people as a result. @!MARGARET-WARNER# Zachary Chesser. @!PETER-BERGEN# Yes. @!MARGARET-WARNER# I had never heard of him. He starts out -- as a kid, he wants to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convicted of trying to threaten the creators of " South Park. " But he seemed to follow a similar pattern, especially on the isolation. @!PETER-BERGEN# There is a sort of pattern where people adopt these fundamentalist views, and they kind of increasingly seek out like-minded people. They kind of withdraw from society. They often marry somebody who shares exactly their views outside their previous social circle. They -- you know, they basically are part a self-reinforcing echo chamber of people who share their own views, and then some may turn to violence. Now, Zachary Chesser, he was inciting violence in a very real way against the creators of " South Park. " He could have been something very different. He could have been a Silicon Valley kid. He was one of the first people to really use the Internet for jihadist purposes. @!MARGARET-WARNER# That 's right. He became a big English-language jihadist blogger. And... @!PETER-BERGEN# Right. Yes. If he had n't had a Somali girlfriend and got interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!MARGARET-WARNER# This book focuses a lot on homegrown and self- radicalized terrorists. But there are Americans who are actively recruited. @!PETER-BERGEN# Well, luckily, it 's not very big now, but we have had lots of Americans who have gone and become important members of al-Qaida. Think about Anwar al-Awlaki, who was a well-known community leader and mosque leader in Northern Virginia, who went on to become a leader of al- Qaida in Yemen. @!MARGARET-WARNER# Right. @!PETER-BERGEN# There are several examples of people who have taken senior leadership positions in these groups who happen to be American. There was an American at the first meeting of al-Qaida in 1988 who was a person taking notes. He was a guy from Kansas city. So, there have been Americans in al-Qaida or these groups from the beginning. @!MARGARET-WARNER# How effective has U.S. intelligence and law enforcement been in containing, of thwarting this threat? @!PETER-BERGEN# We have not had any kind of major terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11. But people get through. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of on the radar at the FBI, the FBI sort of dropped the ball. Carlos Bledsoe, the guy who killed a soldier in Arkansas, he was also on the FBI 's radar. But the FBI, they ca n't keep cases against people open indefinitely. @!MARGARET-WARNER# Just for what they say. @!PETER-BERGEN# Just for what they say. And unless we have a machine that can read people 's souls, we 're not going to know when somebody who is an ultra-fundamentalist becomes a militant who is going to take the law into their own hands. @!MARGARET-WARNER# One of the little-known facts is that FBI and law enforcement and intelligence have concocted more terrorist plots in this country than all the outside organizations like al-Qaida combined. @!PETER-BERGEN# Yes. The FBI has done 30. Al-Qaida and other associated groups have done 10. And depending on your perspective, you can say that 's law enforcement overkill. @!MARGARET-WARNER# What 's the evidence on whether these alleged perpetrators were really committed terrorists or on a path to go there? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to, the outside observers. But the FBI is pretty careful to always say, are you really sure you want to go through with this? And the perpetrator usually says yes. @!MARGARET-WARNER# Well, Peter Bergen, author of " The United States of Jihad, " thank you. @!PETER-BERGEN# Thank you, Margaret. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF# And you can find more of our book conversations on our Arts page at PBS.org/NewsHour.
