222841 @!BARBARA-WALTERS-A : Tonight, most of us believe in the Ten Commandments. Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not steal. Honor thy father and thy mother. Well, in Alabama, a judge decided that those are good laws to live by, and he posted the Ten Commandments on the wall of his courtroom. After all, he said, this country was founded on a belief in God, its laws are based on it. So what 's wrong with that? HUGH DOWNS, ABC News : Well, the law of the land also promises freedom of religion and separation of church and state. How would you feel standing before a judge if you did not believe the Ten Commandments on his wall were the laws of your God? Well, Tom Jarriel reports on an emotional issue that goes to the very heart of this country 's most basic principles @!CHILDREN( singing) Tell the world the message, take it everywhere @!MINISTER That truth is simple and clearly stated. Without God, there is no freedom @!CHILDREN( singing) Tell the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any judge. This is bigger than any governor. This is almighty God.( Applause) TOM JARRIEL, ABC News :( voice-over) Twenty thousand people on the steps of the Alabama state capitol, and hundreds of thousands around the country supporting this man and defending what they see as an assault on God and country. Judge ROY MOORE, Alabama Circuit Court : The ACLU began this controversy. With God 's help, we will finish it. TOM JARRIEL :( voice-over) It began here in a small county courtroom in Gadsden( ph), Alabama, when a newly appointed judge needed to fill empty wall space. Judge ROY MOORE : I was at home one day, and I looked upon the walls of the Ten Commandments plaque which I had carved, and the thought came that I should put that above my bench. Because it truly is the foundation of our American society. It 's the foundation of our laws. And it 's something in which I believe. TOM JARRIEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God and America are inseparable. He 's a devout Southern Baptist, West Point graduate and Vietnam veteran. In 1992, when a circuit judge died, Moore was appointed to the bench. ROY MOORE : I believe that God has -- has placed me in this job to do my job and do a good job. And of course, I would like to acknowledge him in doing this job @!ATTORNEY If I may object again... TOM JARRIEL :( voice-over) And so, he displayed his Ten Commandments prominently above his bench, while he passed judgment on those below. And most people like what they saw. But two years later, some local residents and the American Civil Liberties Union sued.( on camera) What 's wrong with hanging the Ten Commandments on the courthouse wall? BOBBY SEGALL, ACLU Attorney : You know, there 's nothing wrong with the Ten Commandments themselves, obviously. I mean, I feel it 's a precious gift from God. TOM JARRIEL :( voice-over) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the Ten Commandments should come down. BOBBY SEGALL : In court, the judge is supposed to be impartial, and he 's supposed to appear to be impartial. And he 's not supposed to be favoring believers versus nonbelievers. TOM JARRIEL :( on camera) Does it in any way impact on the legal proceedings of a courtroom in terms of jurors looking at it, witnesses knowing it 's up there? BOBBY SEGALL : Well, it could. I mean, it 's pretty tough when you 're accused of robbery, for example, or stealing, and right up there is God 's word about that. TOM JARRIEL :( voice-over) What 's wrong with that, asks the judge, especially when it comes to wayward kids. ROY MOORE : If we were to teach them that you should n't kill, you should n't steal, you should n't bear false witness, perhaps they would believe that even though they were not caught by the law, they were still violating an absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a nation founded upon the belief in God.( Applause) TOM JARRIEL :( voice-over) As the lawsuit moved through the courts, Judge Moore took his case to the people. ROY MOORE : It 's time to stand up and say we have a right to acknowledge God.( Cheering) TOM JARRIEL :( voice-over) The basic legal question -- does the First Amendment 's free exercise of religion apply to Judge Moore and his courtroom? ROY MOORE : You see, by allowing the display of the Ten Commandments and by allowing an acknowledgment of God, that is exercising freedom. By the government restricting the displays, restricting the acknowledgment of God is restricting freedoms. TOM JARRIEL :( voice-over) But critics say the judge must be restricted because the First Amendment does n't allow government-imposed religion, what it calls the establishment of religion. ROY MOORE : Indeed, the acknowledgment of God is not the establishment of religion. It never has been and it never would be @!SOPRANO( singing) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Moore argues that religion is ingrained in our national heritage. Pres. BILL CLINTON : And I will faithfully execute the office... TOM JARRIEL :( voice-over) The federal government has freely acknowledged God. God is mentioned in the Declaration of Independence. COURT CLERK :... the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God. TOM JARRIEL :( voice-over) Courtroom witnesses swear to God. In 1954, Congress added " one nation under God " to the Pledge of Allegiance. And the Ten Commandments? Proof they should stay, said Judge Moore, lies in the fact that Moses and the Commandments are engraved on the walls of the U.S. Supreme Court. But there, they blend in among dozens of moral and historical symbols. In Judge Moore 's embattled courtroom, they stand alone. Gov. FOB JAMES( ph), Alabama : Judge Moore, hold a steady course. We are with you, never doubt my resolve.( Applause) TOM JARRIEL :( voice-over) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fob James thinks removing the Commandments amounts to tearing up the Constitution. FOB JAMES : If you strip the right to post the Ten Commandments in a public place, in essence, you are stripping the Bill of Rights and the true constitutional meaning from the people of the United States, and I think they 're just now waking up to that fact. AWARD PRESENTER : Wo n't you join me in acknowledging and recognizing Judge Roy Moore as Christian statesman of the year. TOM JARRIEL :( voice-over) And they 're standing behind Judge Moore -- 300,000 signatures nationwide insisting the Commandments should stay. Support from major Christian organizations, including this award dinner attended by U.S. senators and congressmen. There 's even a Web site, where you can follow the saga and buy your own stone Ten Commandments for $149.95. But the well of support has not included the Alabama courts. Last February, circuit court judge Charles Price( ph) had to make a decision in the case of Judge Roy Moore versus the ACLU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tablets firsthand, checking every vantage point from jury seats to the witness box. He ordered the judge to take down the Commandments or surround them with other legal and historical documents.( on camera) Judge Price looked it over, and he said, " No go. You need to put other things on the wall. You 've got to broaden your view. A judge ca n't narrowly focus on just the Ten Commandments. " FOB JAMES : Judge Price can not quote any law, any constitutional amendment. That 's his opinion. It 's a very shallow opinion, and we think Judge Price is out to lunch. TOM JARRIEL :( voice-over) Governor James even threatened to call out the National Guard to keep the Commandments in Judge Moore 's courtroom. And with the governor 's help, Judge Moore went to a higher court. For now, pending appeal, the Commandments will stay @!BAILIFF All rise. The circuit court of Etowah( ph) County is now in session. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these proceedings. TOM JARRIEL :( voice-over) But it 's not only the Ten Commandments. About once a month, when juries are selected for various cases, Judge Moore invites a local clergyman, a Christian clergyman, to offer a prayer. ROY MOORE : This is voluntary. I would ask you to respect the rights of those who do wish to pray. TOM JARRIEL :( voice-over) On this day back in February, the court was packed. One potential juror objected. ALFRED FAULKENBERRY, Potential Juror : And I stood up and I said, " Your honor, I object. As an atheist, I object to prayer in a courtroom. " ROY MOORE : Would you like to leave, or would you like to stay? ALFRED FAULKENBERRY : So I had to stumble across the whole courtroom to get out the door. I dare say no one there was there for a prayer meeting. You can have your freedom in your home, in your heart, in your place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be neutral if we 're going to be a one, united country. CHRISTIAN MINISTER : We pray our father that you would give them wisdom... TOM JARRIEL :( voice-over) The circuit court said that Judge Moore 's prayers, like the Commandments, are unacceptable. But this, too, is under appeal. And for now, the prayers can continue.( on camera) Soon the Alabama Supreme Court will hear the case and decide if Judge Moore can lawfully display the Ten Commandments and offer prayer at jury selection. But justices here are elected, and with a recent poll showing 88 percent of the state on Judge Moore 's side, critics fear this decision may be mostly about votes.( voice-over) Wayne Flynt( ph) hopes that 's not the case. He 's an Auburn University history professor and, like Judge Moore, a Southern Baptist. In fact, he 's an ordained Baptist minister. But he thinks the correct decision by the high court will be against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of the Bill of Rights to the U.S. Constitution is the right of protecting people against arrogant majorities, so that no matter how many Americans favor a certain position, you still have constitutional rights guaranteed you as a minority. That 's essentially what this issue is all about. TOM JARRIEL :( voice-over) And it 's not about religion in public places says Flynt, it 's about one particular religion. WAYNE FLYNT : Does Judge Moore have the right to establish his religion, his prayers, his ministers in his courtroom and leave out other traditions, other ethical statements, other prayers, other ministers because they 're not of his religious background? TOM JARRIEL :( on camera) Why not? It 's his courtroom. WAYNE FLYNT : Well, it 's not really his courtroom. It 's the people 's courtroom. And in Alabama, you 'll find Buddhists, you 'll find Muslims, you 'll find nonbelievers. ROY MOORE : Well, of course, if I were going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I would n't put a statue of Buddha up behind my -- my bench because this country was not founded upon a belief in Buddha... TOM JARRIEL :( on camera) But the Buddhists are coming in here... ROY MOORE : Sure. Sure. TOM JARRIEL :... conceivably. They 're paying the taxes that keep this court running. ROY MOORE : This country was founded not upon Buddha, not upon Hinduism, not upon a Muslim belief, but upon a belief in the God of the Holy Scriptures. TOM JARRIEL : But you 're excluding those, are n't you... ROY MOORE : No. TOM JARRIEL :... by your saying that in this courtroom, the Holy Scriptures, the Ten Commandments that 's what 's paramount? ROY MOORE : Absolutely not. TOM JARRIEL : You 're excluding and, in effect, discriminating against them it seems. ROY MOORE : Absolutely not. All we 're doing is acknowledging the God of the Holy Scriptures upon which this nation was founded. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that no matter which way the Alabama supreme court decides, this case could end up in the U.S. Supreme Court. Governor James says that wo n't stop him. FOB JAMES : And I would not allow those Ten Commandments to be stripped from that courthouse until an American president gave the order to do so. TOM JARRIEL :( on camera) You would n't do so on an order from the U.S. Supreme Court? FOB JAMES : Absolutely not. I want the president of the United States to give that order. ROY MOORE : This God of the Holy Scriptures is a basic foundation of this country. And that we have a duty to uphold the Constitution, which is to uphold and support its foundation. And, indeed, that 's what I 'm doing, and there can be nothing wrong with that. HUGH DOWNS : You know, a lot of people think that the -- this case will reach the Supreme Court and that they will hear it, which is a little unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BARBARA WALTERS : I guess, and maybe they might have to remove " in God we trust " from the dollar bill. You know? HUGH DOWNS : Makes you wonder how many people read those words anyway on the dollar bill. BARBARA WALTERS : And would it stop them from spending the money? HUGH DOWNS : Hardly. BARBARA WALTERS : Well, it 's a serious matter, though. Next, women 's boxing. It 's just as vicious, just as bloody, just as dangerous as men 's boxing. Deborah Roberts with the new face of boxing.
