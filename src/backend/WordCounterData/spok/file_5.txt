220641 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Today on YOUR HEALTH, a new twist on old technology, the human CT body scan. Could it be your key to detecting disease in its early stages?( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE : The heart was a little calcified, but no big deal. The lungs were clear, but I had an abnormality in my kidney, described by them as a mass.( END VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : This man says it saved his life. Plus : passing on the gift of life, the delicate balance in giving and receiving donated organs. And healing the scars of tragedy : how artificial skin is improving the lives of burn victims. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT : Welcome to YOUR HEALTH. From the CNN center in Atlanta, I 'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta. What if you could get a painless scan of your body, detecting heart disease, or say cancer, even before you or your doctor detected the slightest symptom? Well you can, but should you?( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GUPTA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been life saving. JERRY SENEKER, PATIENT : I got a brochure in my newspaper one day that was advertising a CT Scan @!GUPTA A scan said to detect all kinds of serious health problems, like heart disease, even cancer, at very early stages. Jerry Seneker, a seemingly healthy 57-year-old, gladly paid more than $500 to get his scan @!SENEKER We hoped that we wasted the money that it cost, because that 'll be good news @!GUPTA But it was n't @!SENEKER The heart was a little calcified, but no big deal. The lungs were clear, but I had an abnormality in my kidney, described by them as a mass @!GUPTA That mass was cancer, and just three weeks later, Seneker had his kidney removed. The cancer never had a chance to spread @!SENEKER It would 've killed me. It would 've shortened my life. There 's no question about that @!GUPTA Businesses across the country are now offering CT Scans to healthy people, promising to find the earliest signs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It 's another piece of information, basically, the same as cholesterol level, the same as your blood pressure @!GUPTA Typically, doctors scan patients who are showing signs or symptoms of a problem. Many doctors say there 's no evidence to support widespread screening. DR. KIMBERLY RASK, EMORY UNIVERSITY : I think we really do n't know yet whether it does a better job of picking up disease early @!GUPTA The American College of Radiology issued this statement : " To date, there is no evidence that total body CT screening is cost efficient or effective in prolonging life. " But Jane Eicher, an osteopathic doctor who works for a mobile CT Scan provider, insists full-body scans save lives @!EICHER Chances are, they 're going to find out something about their body that they want to know. And we know that what we are doing is helping the population @!GUPTA Doctors say if you want to get scanned, be sure the provider uses state-of-the-art CT Scan technology, and there 's a board-certified radiologist to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debate rages over the allocation of health care dollars, insurance companies are reluctant to pay for cat scans in healthy people. The argument : the costs are too high, and the chance of actually finding something too small.( voice-over) : For Jerry Seneker, the verdict is in @!SENEKER Nobody could convince me that it was n't a good idea for me, or anybody else to do it. I do n't know, you know, who would feel that they could put a price on a life.( END VIDEOTAPE) GUPTA : So, sometimes nothing can detect or prepare you for what lies ahead. Next on YOUR HEALTH...( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : At least her little life was n't in vain if she was able to help someone.( END VIDEO CLIP) GUPTA : The passing on of life and death. And why organ donations are sometimes turned down. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Donated organs require special methods of preservation to keep them viable between procurement and transplantation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COMMERCIAL BREAK) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Each day, about 60 people receive an organ transplant, but another 15 people on the waiting list die, because not enough organs are available @!GUPTA Deciding to donate organs when tragedy strikes usually is n't an easy decision. So imagine the disappointment when a gift is turned down. CNN 's Eric Philips looks at how it can happen.( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CAROL HOOPES, LOST DAUGHTER : Most times, I can even get through the day without crying. ERIC PHILIPS, CNN CORRESPONDENT( voice-over) : Carol Hoopes and her husband John lost their 19-year-old daughter Diana and a granddaughter they never really knew as a result of a freak car accident back in March. Diana was a passenger in this car, traveling on Highway 49 in Georgia. That 's when a piece of metal flew off a passing truck, crashed through the windshield and struck the nine- month pregnant woman in the head.( on camera) : The family says the 19-year-old mother was killed instantly. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby Isabelle, was born about 45 minutes after the accident.( voice-over) : Baby Isabelle never woke up. Her brain activity, barely existent as were her chances of a normal life. After 19 days, the family made the difficult decision to take her off life support. They thought they 'd find solace in the fact that the baby would be able to live on by donating six of her organs. But that could n't happen because she did n't meet the strict medical standard of being brain dead. DR. KIRK KANTER, EMORY UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE : We 're very careful that -- so that there 's no concern at all that these organs are being taken from living people. Otherwise, you 're committing murder @!PHILIPS Instead of several organs, Isabelle could only donate two heart valves, which unlike major organs, could be taken after her heart stopped beating @!HOOPES So, that 's what we all said, at least her little life was n't in vain if she was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senator, hoping to change the status quo, because they believe little Isabelle could have helped many more children. In Bonaire, Georgia, Eric Philips, CNN, YOUR HEALTH.( END VIDEOTAPE) GUPTA : Researchers are looking for ways to harvest usable organs, like the heart and liver from patients immediately after death. But so far, that has not become a reality. When we return, a look at the stories making " Health Headlines " this week. Plus, a warning about skin cancer for what seems like an unlikely group. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Melanoma is much less common than non- melanoma skin cancers, but it 's far more serious. It accounts for 4 percent of skin cancer cases, but causes about 79 percent of skin cancer deaths.( COMMERCIAL BREAK)( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RHONDA ROWLAND, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT( voice-over) : Welcome back to YOUR HEALTH. I 'm medical correspondent Rhonda Rowland with this week 's " Health Headlines. " One in three people who undergo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask about it, and patients usually do n't tell. A new study suggests keeping this information hidden could lead to unforeseen dangers in the operating room. Complications range from increased bleeding and cardiovascular effects to interactions with anesthesia. Researchers examined the effects of eight common herbs, including St. John 's wort and ginkgo, which account for half of all herbal use. The study suggest some herbs should be discontinued a week before surgery, others a day before surgery. Plus, can your morning cup of tea boost your health, even if it 's plain old black tea? Researchers at Boston University Medical Center say yes. They found antioxidant flavanoids, found in black tea, can temporarily reverse cell damage caused by coronary artery disease. But cardiologists caution patients should not substitute tea for their medications. Detractors say the month-long study, focusing on an artery in the arm, is a far cry from explaining exactly how tea might reduce or prevent heart disease. And oyster lovers beware. A consumer advocacy group is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've been cooked or treated to kill bacteria. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration says only people who are especially vulnerable to bacteria, such as people with diabetes, liver disease or a suppressed immune system need avoid eating raw oysters. The bacteria is blamed for 15 to 20 deaths a year. That 's a look at this week 's " YOUR HEALTH Headlines. "( END VIDEOTAPE) GUPTA : Recovering from a burn injury can be excruciating, and facing a lifetime of scars can adds to the pain. But as CNN 's Lilian Kim reports, a new skin substitute is making a crucial difference in many burn centers. It 's also giving genuine hope to burn victims.( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Can I see you raise your hands up over your head? LILIAN KIM, CNN CORRESPONDENT( voice-over) : A power-line accident left Peter Van Horn with third-degree burns over 40 percent of his body. But now, more than two years after his surgery, doctors are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrific. I mean, it 's soft @!KIM The smooth look is the result of artificial skin. On parts of his body without it, the skin appears lumpy and discolored. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : It 's non-pliable, it 's rock hard. It 's like fish net stockings @!KIM What 's the difference? Integra. The collagen material looks and functions like the inner layer of the skin, protecting patients from major infection. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Here 's a piece for the arm @!KIM But Integra is just a base layer. Surgeons will later cover it with the patient 's own skin. DR. DAVID HEIMBACH, DIRECTOR, HARBORVIEW BURN CENTER : It does n't form ugly scars. It is not -- only God can make normal skin, and it 's not quite normal skin, but it is between what we used to consider an acceptable result, which is really ugly, and normal skin. KIM( on camera) : Hospitals were using Integra in clinical trials during the 1980s, but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FDA. Now, 60 medical centers across the country are treating patients with this artificial skin.( voice-over) : For Van Horn, it 's made a big difference to his body and his spirit. PETER VAN HORN, BURN PATIENT : We live in our skin, it 's what we present to the world, and it 's very important to have a body image that you feel that you look good. Lilian Kim, CNN, YOUR HEALTH.( END VIDEOTAPE) GUPTA : If you 're hoping to look good on the beach this summer, exercise is key. But do n't head out into the heat unprotected. When we return, some tips for beating the heat before it beats you. But first, our " Doctor Q &A"; from our CNN health Web site.( COMMERCIAL BREAK) GUPTA : It 's the season for fun in the sun. But remember, too much sun can be dangerous for everyone. As CNN 's Leon Harris explains, being dark-skinned does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) LEON HARRIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT( voice-over) : It was an annoying itch under his armpit that prompted Charles Dryden to see a dermatologist. CHARLES DRYDEN, SKIN CANCER PATIENT : She did an exam on me, and on me she found suspicious areas under my armpits, so she took I guess a biopsy or whatever it is, she took a sample, a scraping, and found... HARRIS( on camera) : Was it under the skin or on top of it? DRYDEN : No, it was under the armpits. HARRIS( voice-over) : As an African-American, Dryden never thought he was at risk for skin cancer. But his biopsy showed otherwise. He had developed basal cell carcinoma, a type of skin cancer rarely seen in blacks. Dermatologist Gloria Campbell D'Hue says Dryden 's not alone. DR. GLORIA CAMPBELL D'HUE, DERMATOLOGIST : Blacks do get skin cancers too. Our melanin protects us, so we do n't get quite as much damage, but we still get damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? D'HUE : Yes, we do. Yes, we do. So you want to prevent as much as you can. HARRIS( voice-over) : According to an article in the journal " Cancer, " African-Americans have a natural sun protection factor of 13, which protects against ultraviolet radiation and reduces skin cancer incidence. However, dermatologists point out several factors that may increase skin cancer risk in African-Americans, including prolonged sun exposure and radiation therapy. Doctors say it 's difficult to detect cancers on dark skin. Researchers believe many patients do n't visit their doctors often enough, so their cancer worsens. D'HUE : And they do procrastinate in having those moles checked out, and then along the lines, if they would just do that annual evaluation @!HARRIS The American Cancer Society recommends a skin self examination for everyone each month, by standing in front of a mirror. First, examine your face, chest, arms, belly, thighs, buttocks and back. Then, sit down to check the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunscreen with an SPF of 15. During long sun-exposure between 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m, doctors advise wearing clothing that cover up from head to toe. And ask a doctor about anything you see that suspicious, as Charles Dryden did, to help early diagnosis. Leon Harris, CNN.( END VIDEOTAPE) GUPTA : The sun can be dangerous in more ways than one. This week 's " Feeling Fit " warns us about the risks of exercising in the heat.( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JULIETTE DOUGLAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT( voice-over) : With warm weather and sunny days, you may think there 's nothing better than exercising outdoors. But according to the American Council on Exercise, summer 's heat can raise your body 's temperature as high as five degrees Fahrenheit above normal. DR. WILLIAM JACKSON JR., EMERGENCY ROOM PHYSICIAN : Some folks get nauseous, have body cramping. They 'll get light-headedness, feel a sense of fatigue @!DOUGLAS Here are some tips to help you enjoy summer and beat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough fluids, whether it 's water or a sports drink, is imperative when exercising in hot or humid weather. To ensure the right balance, health experts suggest food replenishment before, during and after exercise. Aim for six to eight ounces of fluid for every 15 to 20 minutes of exercise. Watch exercise intensity. Start off slow and gradually build up as your body becomes accustomed to the heat. Work out during off-peak heat hours, get started early in the morning or try exercising in late afternoon after the temperature starts to drop. The right gear will also help beat the heat. Wear lightweight and loose clothing and avoid dark colors, which absorb the sun 's rays. Listen to your body. If you feel fatigued, continue your workout on another day. When you 're done, chill out with a fruit smoothie. It will cool you down and count toward your daily recommended servings of fruit. For " Feeling Fit, " I 'm Juliette Douglas.( END VIDEOTAPE)( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that using peppermint oil helps relieve pain in children suffering from irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS. There is no cure for IBS @!GUPTA Last year, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new drug for irritable bowel syndrome. This drug improved the lives of thousands of patients. Just nine months later, however, the drug was pulled, due to reports of new side effects and deaths. CNN 's medical correspondent Rhonda Rowland looks at the impact this decision has had on the lives of those without medications.( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROWLAND( voice-over) : A 10-minute drive to work will put 30- year-old Corey Miller into a panic. Would he make it to a restroom in time if needed? He has irritable bowel syndrome, a disorder causing severe abdominal cramps, constipation, diarrhea. COREY MILLER, IBS PATIENT : A lot of people would joke about situations such as this and not really understand how it affects you emotionally and mentally @!ROWLAND Since symptoms can come on suddenly, Miller says his life was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it affects everything from a simple date, or you 're eating out at a restaurant with my friends, or going to sporting events @!ROWLAND Medical treatments failed him until he tried a newly- approved drug called Lotronex. His life turned around, but then just months later, the FDA pulled the drug from the market without warning @!MILLER It was a shock and disbelief, and then it turned to anger and how could somebody take my life away from me @!ROWLAND Taken away because Lotronex had been linked to 127 serious side effects, 68 resulted in hospitalizations. An additional 24 required surgery and four deaths of the 350,000 people who have taken it during its nine months on the market. DR. JANE WOODCOCK, FDA : We have to balance the benefits to the many versus the risk to a small number of people @!ROWLAND The risks, say some doctors, is that once the drug is on the market, it can be prescribed for anyone, despite the fine print. For instance, Lotronex was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Miller. Dr. Emeran Mayer, who conducted studies of Lotronex on several hundred patients says it has no serious side effects when prescribed appropriately. DR. EMERAN MAYER, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES : Many of the serious side effects arose in situations where the medication was given to the wrong -- for the wrong indication. ROWLAND( on camera) : Some doctors say Lotronex was approved too quickly under the FDA 's user fee program, also known as fast track. During the early 1990s, more money was pumped into the agency to speed up drug approvals, cutting review times from about three years to one year. The idea was to approve life-saving drugs for diseases like AIDS and cancer faster.( voice-over) : Of the three drugs pulled from the market last year, two were fast track. One of them was Lotronex @!WOODCOCK And some of the ones that have been withdrawn under the user fee program actually took several years in some cases to review. So, we do n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the FDA has been under pressure from two sides. On the one hand, those who want the drugs available faster. CHRISTOPHER MILNE, TUFTS CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT : On the other hand, they are getting this pressure from consumer and patient advocacy groups, saying, well, we are not sure this is really what we want. This is -- there may be some safety concerns @!ROWLAND Miller and other patients who benefited from the drug are petitioning the FDA, the drug maker, Glaxo Smith Kline, and other officials to make the drug available again. For Miller, having the drug taken away, he says, is worse than never having it to begin with @!MILLER It 's just -- it 's unbearable to even to know that there 's a medicine out there that will help and that no one is going to produce it or sell it @!ROWLAND Glaxo Smith Kline is in discussions with the FDA to determine if Lotronex should be made available again. In the meantime, Miller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about the day it could run out. Rhonda Rowland, CNN, YOUR HEALTH.( END VIDEOTAPE) GUPTA : That 's all we have time for today.
