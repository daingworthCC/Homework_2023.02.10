233041 CHAPTER AND VERSE @!CHARLES-OSGOOD-ho : Some people know the Bible well enough to cite it Chapter And Verse. For them, the rhythm of the words and the stories have become like second nature. For others, though, the size and complexity of the Bible have been daunting and intimidating. But lately, there seems to have been a change in the air. More and more, people seem to be reading the Bible -- really reading it. Terence Smith reports our SUNDAY MORNING cover story. @(Footage-of-church-) @!TERENCE-SMITH-repo : @(Voiceover) It all begins with this : The Bible. We cherish it in our churches. Unidentified Reverend : The Holy gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, according to Mark. Unidentified Church Congregation :( In unison) The Lord Jesus Christ. Former President GEORGE BUSH :( From swearing-in ceremony) I, George Herbert Walker Bush, do solemnly swear... @!SMITH :... our leaders take their oaths upon it. We swear to tell the truth on it. Unidentified Man 1 :( From swearing-in ceremony)... so help me God. President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help me God. Man 1 :( From swearing-in ceremony) Congratulations. @!SMITH : The greatest story ever told is also the greatest best-seller ever published. Just last year, the American Bible Society distributed almost 18 million Bibles. But this most-bought book is also among the least read. qwq @( Excerpts-from- " Sam @!SMITH : @(Voiceover) Now, however, this biblical illiteracy may be changing. From popular television to public broadcasting, there is a new appetite for religious themes... Unidentified Woman 1 : Death does not allow for change. Remorse allows for change. @(Footage-of-people-) @!SMITH : @(Voiceover)... a willingness to ponder the essential truths of the Bible, a hunger for its message. Unidentified Woman 2 :( Reading) ' The Lord does not delay in keeping his promise, though some consider it delay. Rather, he shows you generous patience... ' @(Footage-of-Bible-s) @!SMITH : @(Voiceover) Around the country, groups, like these young Catholic professionals in Arlington, Virginia, have formed to read and interpret Scripture. Unidentified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing because I had a really rough week. And part of it is -- is dealing with some frenetic scheduling and stuff. And... @(Footage-of-Bible-s) @!SMITH : @(Voiceover) Some in the group have only recently begun to turn to the Bible for guidance. Woman 2 : I actually intended one time -- I remember when I was in high school. I was like, ' I 'm going to read this thing front to back, ' you know. Did that happen? No. But, you know, I got through, like, Genesis, and then there was a little bit of Exodus, and I 'm like, ' Whew, boring, ' you know. Unidentified Woman 4 : I do n't think you can have a healthy spiritual life if you are stagnant. And I think it 's very important to hear what other people say, and, of course, the priest. qwq @( Footage-of-church- Reverend FORREST CHURCH( All Souls Unitarian Church) : @(Voiceover) I think that there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving from pure material benchmarks of success to a deeper sense of their own soul and their own spirit. Hi, Forrest Church. How nice to see you. Good. @(Footage-of-Church-) @!SMITH : @(Voiceover) The Reverend Forrest Church is pastor of All Souls Unitarian Church in Manhattan. Unidentified Woman 5 : I 'm wondering if you could inscribe a copy for my dad? @!Rev-CHURCH : OK. What 's his name? Woman 5 : Tom. @!Rev-CHURCH : Tom. Sure, I 'd love to. @(Footage-of-Church-) @!SMITH : @(Voiceover)... and author of " Life Lines, " one of several new books that draw on the Bible. @!Rev-CHURCH : Thanks a lot. Woman 5 : Thank you. @!Rev-CHURCH : I appreciate that a lot. Hello, Kasey. There is, I think, a natural interest in reacquainting oneself with those ancient and very fine stories. For a time, the Bible was held, perhaps, in captivity by the religious right, in my own opinion. @!SMITH : What do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became the gathering symbols of the right-wing revolution. Now we can either dismiss the Bible because others have a very narrow, restrictive, literalistic approach to it -- almost a punitive approach, because it divides people rather than uniting them -- or we can take the spirit, embrace it, engage it. @!Dr-PETER-GOMES-@1A : Now how may I inscribe this? @!DEREK : To Derek. @(Footage-of-Gomes-s) @!SMITH : @(Voiceover) That spirit is what engaged Dr. Peter Gomes to write " The Good Book : Reading The Bible With Mind And Heart. " Now in its fifth printing, it has become, well, the Bible of those mainstream, non-fundamentalist Christians, who feel they are taking back Scripture. @!Dr-GOMES : What the Bible requires is for us to use our mind to interpret it. It is a book that cries out to be interpreted, not swallowed whole. @(Footage-of-church-) @!SMITH : @(Voiceover) The Reverend Gomes is a conservative Republican who delivered the benediction at Ronald Reagan 's second inauguration. @!Dr-GOMES : Those of you who have faith in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 're on the wrong side of the equation. @(Footage-of-church-) @!SMITH : @(Voiceover) A renowned preacher and chief minister of Harvard 's Memorial Church, he startled the university community five years ago when he announced publicly that he is gay. @!Dr-GOMES : You have to be choosy about what parts of the Bible you -- you accept as absolute and literal and normative, and what parts of the Bible you regard as locked in their social time and of no real consequence in our present day. @(Footage-of-Gomes-g) @!SMITH : @(Voiceover) Dr. Gomes notes that literalists have used the Bible to condone slavery, anti-Semitism and the subjugation of women in the past, and now are using it to denounce homosexuality. One question I suppose readers will -- will raise in their mind about this book and about you is whether your sexuality informs your theology or vice-versa. @!Dr-GOMES : The only definition that I accept, and the only one I 'll permit anyone to label me with, is that of Christian. That is what I am. That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, as a Christian. Now that -- homosexuality is as much a part of my being as my race, as my gender, as the fact that I am -- am near-sighted, am short and given to stoutness. Those are part of my being, but I 'm not defined exclusively by any of those. Former President JIMMY CARTER : You 've been waiting long? Unidentified Woman 6 : Since 8:00. @!Mr-CARTER : Eight o'clock? I love you. You 're sweet. @(Footage-of-Carter-) @!SMITH : @(Voiceover) The lists of authors of new books on the Bible includes an ex-president. @!Mr-CARTER : How you doing? Paul is saying that through Christ we were given an insight into the essence of God, the essence of life. @(Footage-of-Carter-) @!SMITH : @(Voiceover) Jimmy Carter, who has taught the Bible in Sunday school for more than 40 years, is currently on the best-seller list with " Living Faith, " a highly personal spiritual autobiography. @!Mr-CARTER : I 'm not trying to lay down doctrine that everybody else has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the truth about my own existence, my relationship with God, my relationship with my fellow human beings and how has religion played the role. @(Footage-of-Carter-) @!SMITH : @(Voiceover) The 39th president candidly concedes in the book that he has had moments when he doubted his faith, including in 1966 when he lost the Georgia governorship to segregationist Lester Maddox. @!Mr-CARTER : And I was disillusioned, not only with the Georgia people, but also with God. I -- I did n't see how God could let this happen. So, in effect, I rejected my faith. @(Footage-of-Carter-) @!SMITH : @(Voiceover) He also acknowledges that he and his wife, Rosalyn, had their difficulties, especially in the early days of their marriage. @!Mr-CARTER : I was a young, arrogant naval officer, a disciplinarian. Rosalyn was an innocent, naive, young girl from Plains. Sometimes she felt that my insensitivity was based on a failure to love and respect her. But out of our shared faith, I would say, we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @(Voiceover) That shared faith is based on the Bible, which the two of them read to each other each night. @!Mr-CARTER : I think in many ways it helps us overcome differences that might have arisen during the day between us. It 's hard to -- to -- to maintain a pouting attitude or a disharmonious attitude when you have to read the Scripture to each other aloud. qwq @( Footage-of-Church, @!SMITH : @(Voiceover) All this renewed interest in the Bible has in common a sense of discovery, and a belief that Scripture should unite people, rather than divide or exclude them. @!Mr-CARTER : God is love. And I think that people have such a complicated concept of God... @(Footage-of-church-) @!Mr-CARTER : @(Voiceover)... as the creator of the universe, or as someone keeping tabs on us, or punitive or whatever, that the simpli -- simplicity of that statement is transforming.
