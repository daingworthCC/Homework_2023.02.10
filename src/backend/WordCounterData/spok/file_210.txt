4122941 @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Can not wait to see all of that. But right now, we 're gon na begin with that second chance at freedom for a North Carolina man convicted of killing his wife. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Voiceover) After a five-year battle, an appeals court has granted a new trial to Brad Cooper, who has always insisted he 's innocent. Dan Abrams, Nancy Grace here to weigh in on what happens next. First, the latest on the case from ABC 's Linsey Davis. Good morning, Linsey. @!LINSEY-DAVIS# @(Off-camera) Good morning, George. He was convicted of strangling his wife back in 2008. And this morning, Brad Cooper is one step closer to having his day in court again. His lawyer says that this time she anticipates crucial testimony about her client 's computer could just set him free. @!LINSEY-DAVIS# @(Voiceover) Brad Cooper deserves a retrial. That 's the ruling of an appeals court that agrees with the defense 's argument that Cooper 's attorneys were denied the right to present testimony from two, key witnesses. @!BRAD-COOPER# If anyone knows anything, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 34-year-old Nancy Cooper disappeared on July 12, 2008. Her husband claims she went for an early morning jog and never returned home. Two days later, her body was found. @!CHIEF-PATRICIA-BAZ# Nancy was murdered, and our investigation is now a homicide. @!DONNA-RENTZ# This is the single, most heartrending tragedy that has ever befallen our family. @!LINSEY-DAVIS# @(Voiceover) Prosecutors alleged Cooper killed her, upset over his wife 's plans to divorce him and move to Canada with their two daughters. The only direct evidence linking him to the murder, a Google map search done on Cooper 's laptop the day before his wife died, showing the exact spot where her body was later discovered. Cooper says he 's innocent, alleging anyone who had access to his computer during investigation could have planted that evidence. @!JUDGE# Find the defendant, Bradley Graham Cooper, to be guilty of first-degree murder. @!LINSEY-DAVIS# @(Voiceover) The jury did n't buy it. And in 2011, he was convicted of first-degree murder, sentenced to life in prison without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeals court said the judge should have allowed the defense 's two computer experts to testify that Cooper 's computer could have been tampered with and that not doing so constituted reversible error, requiring a new trial. @!LINSEY-DAVIS# @(Voiceover) In a statement to ABC News, Cooper 's attorney says she is very happy with the decision, saying, " Brad 's trial was so unfair. I do not think in all my 33 years of practice have I seen a case where a defendant was so completely stymied or prevented from presenting his defense to the critical issues in this case no matter what he tried than in this case. " @!LINSEY-DAVIS# @(Off-camera) Cooper 's lawyer says the two witnesses who were not allowed to testify would have provided evidence that the Google map files on his computer had, in fact, been tampered with. She says anyone with a little computer knowledge could have placed those files on his computer. Robin? @!ROBIN-ROBERTS# @(Off-camera) All right, Linsey. Thanks so much. We 're gon na bring back our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's here in the studio with me. And from Atlanta, Nancy Grace, host of " Nancy Grace " on HLN. Always good to see you, too, Nance. And we 'll start here in the studio with Dan. Was it the, the right decision here? @!DAN-ABRAMS# @(Off-camera) it was. I mean, this was the most important piece of evidence in this case. @!DAN-ABRAMS# @(Voiceover) Imagine a Google search for the exact spot where her body was found the day before it happened. And the defense wanted to present evidence that said that there were invalid time stamps, there was no cookie found. And as a result, their experts believed that it either could have been planted or tampered with. That 's crucial evidence that the defense should have been able to present, and the appeals court made the right call. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS# @(Voiceover) How about you, Nancy? Do you think it was the right decision to call for a new trial? Well, actually, it was the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na make a difference. There 's so much evidence that this guy killed his wife that he 's gon na have the same outcome on the retrial. He 's gon na get life without parole all over again. @!DAN-ABRAMS# @(Voiceover) I do n't think there is that much evidence. I mean, comparatively to other cases that we 've seen, there is a lot of sort of suspicion out there about him. Of course, he is the, the husband in this case. But this was the key piece of evidence. When you talk, when you go through all of the other evidence in the case, the defense had an argument against it except for this piece of evidence. So it 's gon na be a much closer case than, than Nancy suggests( inaudible). Dan, they may have had an argument, but it did n't amount to a hill of beans. I mean, I assume you 've seen " Home Alone 3, " when Kevin, the little boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone rerouted to make a call to himself to give himself an alibi while he 's standing in front of a surveillance camera at a grocery store. Come on. It 's so obvious. He fights with her at a neighborhood party the night before. She 's leaving him. She 's going home to Canada with his children. He 's having an affair. He 's been copying all of her emails back and forth to her lawyer and sending them to his new sports website about himself. Come on. They had a big fight the night before. The next morning she 's gone, she 's dead. @!DAN-ABRAMS# @(Voiceover) First of all... @!ROBIN-ROBERTS# @(Voiceover) But does all that prove murder though? That 's what the other side is saying that all that has been brought up, you 're right, Nancy, in court. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS# @(Off-camera) There was, like, 36 days of testimony in the first trial. @!DAN-ABRAMS# @(Off-camera) Right. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS# @(Off-camera) But they 're saying, does that lead to murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " Home Alone 2 " not " Home Alone 3. " But, but on the issue... No, " Home Alone 3 " is when the phone was rerouted. @!DAN-ABRAMS# @(Off-camera) All right. Check your facts, Dan. @!DAN-ABRAMS# @(Off-camera) I will. I will. This one, that one I will recheck. But this issue with the phone, let 's be clear what Nancy 's talking about here. He allegedly got a phone call that morning from his wife. From himself. @!DAN-ABRAMS# @(Off-camera) If he got that phone call from his wife, it means his wife was alive. It likely means... Who was facedown dead in a drainpipe at the time. @!DAN-ABRAMS# @(Off-camera) Hang on. It likely means that he did n't do it. Now, Nancy is making the point that the prosecution was suggesting there was n't an iota of evidence that this actually happened. But the prosecution was suggesting that he could have effectively spoofed the call. Ooh. Dan, what does he do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... He is a telecommunications expert with Cisco. @!DAN-ABRAMS# @(Off-camera) That 's right. And therefore... Right? @!DAN-ABRAMS# @(Off-camera)... it means he could have done it, right? Yeah. @!DAN-ABRAMS# @(Off-camera) But that does n't mean that he did do it. And then just in case surveillance did n't catch him squeezing the pineapple the first time in the grocery store, during the fake phone call... @!DAN-ABRAMS# @(Off-camera) Right.... he did it again. And he had to come up with an idea, oh, my wife called me and said not only do we need milk, we also need detergent. So he gets back in front of the surveillance camera to fake another phone call. @!DAN-ABRAMS# @(Off-camera) So the prosecution in this case basically said that he created a fake phone call, in effect, to himself... @!ROBIN-ROBERTS# @(Off-camera) Right. @!DAN-ABRAMS# @(Off-camera)... to make it seem like she 'd called. Which he did. @!DAN-ABRAMS# @(Off-camera) The problem with that is that there was a lot of suggestion, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have, but there was n't any direct evidence that it actually happened. And that 's why this case is gon na be so much harder the second time around. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS# @(Off-camera) And another question for... Except that she was dead in a drainpipe at the time the phone call was made so( inaudible). @!DAN-ABRAMS# @(Off-camera) But you would agree - you would agree, Nancy, if the phone call was made that that would be very helpful to the defense, right? If the call had been made. Yeah, if it had been made. @!DAN-ABRAMS# @(Off-camera) Right. Okay. But I happen to know she was dead at the time, facedown in the drainpipe. @!DAN-ABRAMS# @(Off-camera) Okay. So it was n't made. He did it himself. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS# @(Off-camera) Let me ask you this last, one - one final question, Nancy. Pending a new trial, do you believe that he should be released on bail? Oh, absolutely not. He should be on an appellate bond. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new trial. Under our Constitution, you have a right to counter what the state brings on with your own expert. And I disagree with the trial judge. But I, I do, I do n't really believe, and you 're gon na see this in the end, Dan, that another jury is going to agree with the first jury. And maybe this time around, the defendant will have the guts to take the stand. @!DAN-ABRAMS# @(Off-camera) We 'll see. I, it, this could definitely lead to a hung jury, make this a much tougher case for prosecutors but... Mm-hmm. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS# @(Off-camera) And again the first trial lasted more than a month. @!DAN-ABRAMS# @(Off-camera) Yeah. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS# @(Off-camera) All right. We 'll see what happens. Nancy. @!DAN-ABRAMS# @(Off-camera) Great to be back with you, Nancy. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS# @(Off-camera) Good to see you again, Nancy. Thanks so much. Likewise. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS# @(Off-camera) Take care. Dan, thank you. Let 's get over now to @ @
