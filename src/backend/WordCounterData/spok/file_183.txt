4073041 BRET @!BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR : President Obama promises a 24/7 effort until the gulf region is better than it was before the oil spill. Could the disaster be the impetus behind the move away from oil as America 's number one energy source? The rhetoric versus reality. And we 'll tell you why congressional Democrats are working without a budget. Live from our studio in Washington, this is SPECIAL REPORT. Good evening. I 'm Bret Baier. President Obama is in the gulf region tonight making his fourth trip in the 56 days since the BP oil spill began. We have FOX team coverage tonight. Senior political analyst Brit Hume has some thoughts about the president 's approach to the disaster. Correspondent James Rosen looks at the possible energy policy changes that could result from the spill. But we begin with senior White House correspondent Major Garrett in Theodore, Alabama, on the president 's day down south. @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!MAJOR-GARRETT-FOX : President Obama, the political drag of the unrelenting BP oil spill gumming up his presidency, traveled for the first time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Obama heard from the Coast Guard and put in a Chamber of Commerce plug for local beaches. @!BARACK-OBAMA-PRES : There are still a lot of opportunity for visitors to come down here. A lot of beaches that are not yet affected or will not be affected. @!GARRETT : The president 's lunch featured crab cakes and shrimp salad. Later, Mr. Obama flatly declared gulf seafood fit to eat. A bit( INAUDIBLE) snow-combed beach. Gulfport 's beaches are clean, but nearly empty. Beach umbrellas flutter over swabs of soft, white, deserted sand. Blocks away at this popular local hangout, patrons are few. Steve Platts, 50, grew up here and before the spill ate seafood once a day. An Obama supporter, Platts said he 's off seafood for good. @!STEVE-PLATTS-GULF : As far is in my heart, I do n't want to fish or eat the fish anymore. I do n't trust anything coming out of the gulf. @!GARRETT : Platts says the oil slick when viewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!PLATTS : Oil in the water ca n't be worked on in the way that Katrina -- you can send 100,000 people. It does n't work. It does n't fix it. @!GARRETT : In Orange Beach, Alabama, the oil is on shore. Swimming is forbidden. Clumps of oil ride the tide and break apart, some bigger than others. Giant sifters blade up the oil churning it to a slightly brownish white. Even after clean-up, the beach remains stained. But not everyone is boycotting. Lisa Coleman brought her two children and a nephew down from Greenville, Mississippi, and says most of what she 's come here for over the years remains. @!LISA-COLEMAN-GREE : Well, the beach is still wonderful. The kids can play in the sand just like they always do. You still feel the breeze. You still hear the ocean. @!GARRETT : In nearby Theodore, Alabama, Mr. Obama surveyed workers decontaminating oil slick boom at one of 16 boom staging areas laced across the gulf. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an escrow fund available to pay economic and environmental claims. @!OBAMA- : So far, we 've had a constructive conversation. And my hope is that by the time the chairman and I meet on Wednesday, that we 've made sufficient progress that we can start actually seeing a structure that would be in place. @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!GARRETT : The president says he hopes to have an announcement Wednesday. Of course, that meeting at the White House with BP executives would occur the morning after his Oval Office address to the nation on the spill. Under administration pressure, BP said today it would increase its oil containment by 20,000 barrels a day. By the end of this month, by 40,000 barrels a day by mid-July -- Bret. @!BAIER : Major Garrett live in Alabama tonight. Major, thank you. We will have complete coverage of the president 's speech, plus analysis Tuesday night, 8:00 p.m. Eastern. The disaster has renewed the call by some to eliminate America 's dependence on oil, foreign and domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea is. @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!JAMES-ROSEN-FOX-N : Oil can cause horrific accidents and environmental damage and it often comes from places where the government is unfriendly to Americans or at best an uncertain ally. But in terms of its broad and amazing utility and its relative cheapness and accessibility, oil right now outperforms all other substances as an energy source, which is why it still powers 40 percent of American energy usage and is n't going away anytime soon. @!DIRK-DURBIN-@1D-IL : It 's naive to think we 'll end our dependence on oil overnight. It is just such a major part of our lives and our( INAUDIBLE). But we are moving forward with new technologies and new attempts. Since the early 1970s, when America endured its first Arab oil embargo and long gas lines, the percentage of oil we import from other countries has doubled to more than half our total supply. At the same time, in the quarter century after 1980, the U.S. reduced its energy intensity, the amount of energy we require to produce one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!TOM-PRICE-@1D@2-G : We remain dependent on oil, primarily because of the federal government 's inaction. If we 're honest with ourselves over the last 30 to 40 years, we have not had a coherent energy policy through both Republican and Democrat administrations. @!JEFF-MERKLEY-@1D@2 : It affects our national security. @!ROSEN : Today brought yet another new plan for energy independence, one that set a timetable of two decades and sought to capitalize on the despair in the gulf. @!MERKLEY : We should not simply say, well, we 're not quite ready. We 're a few votes short. Let 's just wait. Because the challenges of the way we consume energy currently, the problems it 's creating are not waiting. @!ROSEN : Prior to the gulf disaster, the Department of Energy projected U.S. crude oil production would increase by 2034, spurred by rising oil prices overseas and by advances in deep water drilling here at home. Which is why Gulf Coast lawmakers of both parties plead against a six-month federal moratorium on such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to sit pat for six months and simply wait. Most are going to move to other parts of the world like West Africa. @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!ROSEN : Other countries are also struggling to wean themselves from oil. In 1973, oil accounted for nearly half the world 's energy consumption. But by five years ago, it accounted for only 35 percent of world demand -- Bret. @!BAIER : James, thank you. So what can we expect from the president 's speech Tuesday night? Senior political analyst Brit Hume has some thoughts. Good evening, Brit. @!BRIT-HUME-FOX-NEW : Hi, Bret. @!HUME : After another day spent on the Gulf Coast in a show of empathy for the victims of the oil spill, President Obama will be back on more comfortable ground tomorrow evening for his address to the nation from the Oval Office. He will reportedly use the address among other things to urge passage of the climate legislation known as cap-and-trade, which is intended to force major changes in the way Americans use energy. Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his full attention in a way the oil spill seems only lately to have become. There is a sense about this president that the mundane, day-to- day duties of his office do not much interest him, that he feels he was elected to do great things and not grapple with grubby details. Confronted with the major recession, he left it to Congress to write the remedy in the form of a massive dose of deficit spending, much of it patently wasteful. He then signed that bill and quickly moved on to something more ambitious, the restructuring of the nation 's health care system. Here again, he left the details to Congress and the result was legislation so costly and unpopular that a large public majority favors its repeal and the administration has now mounted a major new campaign to sell the thing. There is nothing wrong with the president having a large vision. The question, though, about this president is whether he truly has a large vision of and for America, or simply a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an interesting comment in an interview with " Politico. " And here 's what he said. Quote, " In the same way that our view of our vulnerabilities and our foreign policy was shaped profoundly by 9/11, I think this disaster is going to shape how we think about the environment and energy for many years to come. " What do you think about that? @!HUME : Well, it sounds a little bit like another way of saying you should n't let a crisis go to waste, the comment his aide Rahm Emanuel famously made at the beginning of the administration. Obviously, he 's looking to pass some major legislation. In other words, he 's looking for an opportunity to do something large. The mere ultimate fixing and undoing the damage from the oil spill seems not to be great enough for this president. He 's looking for something truly big. This is how he thinks. This is how he thinks of himself. @!BAIER : OK, Brit. Thanks. @!HUME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on tape displaying a questionable attitude toward a questioning student. And we 'll answer your questions about why Congress has not passed a budget this year. @!BAIER : In tonight 's America 's Election Headquarters, " the South Carolina politician who lost last week 's Democratic Senate primary to a virtually unknown candidate has filed a formal protest. Former state lawmaker Vic Rawl is alleging irregularities in the vote totals. Alvin Greene won the primary despite having raised no money, produced no ads and having no campaign Web site. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has extended its order that no claims be paid to providers until June 18th. That is in order to give the Senate time to delay a 21 percent cut in reimbursements which had been set to go into effect Tuesday. The FBI has released previously secret records about the late Senator Edward Kennedy. Most of the documents concern death threats and extortion attempts. Kennedy died last year at the age of 77 of brain cancer. Kennedy 's former Democratic colleagues in Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Chief Washington correspondent Jim Angle tells us why and how that 's going over. @(AUDIO-GLITCH) @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!JIM-ANGLE-FOX-NEW : Republicans have been railing against the failure of the House to pass a budget this year. Then Saturday night, President Obama sent a request for $50 billion more in deficit spending to help financially strapped states. And some Republicans erupted. @!JOHN-BOEHNER-@1R-O : The spending spree in Washington is continuing to run unabated. The American people are screaming at the top of their lungs " stop! " @!ANGLE : Boehner agrees with the president the states may need help to keep from laying off teachers, firemen and policemen but argues spending should be cut elsewhere to free up the $50 billion. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer agrees and suggests taking it from unspent stimulus money rather than running up more debt. @!REP-STENY-HOYER-@1 : It 's accurate that there is spending fatigue not only on Capitol Hill but around the country. People are concerned about the debt level and we are as well. @!ANGLE : Minority Leader Boehner and others have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet passed a budget for the first time in more than 35 years. Boehner even evoked the chairman of the Federal Reserve who said last week the deficit is unsustainable. @!BOEHNER : Chairman Bernanke also expressed his concern that Congress has no exit strategy in place to get out of this mess. No strategy, no plan and not even a budget. @!ANGLE : Why have n't Democrats been able to pass a budget? Because some want large deficit spending to help those hurt by the recession. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : They need services, unemployment, for example, help with paying for health insurance. And so it 's tough. It 's very difficult. @!ANGLE : But other Democrats fear running up even more debt when voters are already enraged by deficit spending. @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : There are some Democrats quite wisely who think that if they pass a budget with two large numbers and increase the deficit, then they 're going to be voted out of office come November. @!ANGLE : The dilemma is apparent to the administration as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House does n't just identify spending cuts and send them to Congress. @!PETER-ORSZAG-BUDG : It just comes down to a question of whether it 's a fruitless exercise because you have very little probability of success in the current environment. @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : And it 's especially remarkable because we have the House, the Senate, the presidency all with one party. They 're all under the control of the Democrats. @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!ANGLE : But never fear, the absence of a budget does n't keep Congress from spending. The money, your money, just keeps rolling out. Though we 're spending so much these days, 43 cents of every dollar spent is borrowed -- Bret. @!BAIER : Unreal. Jim, thank you. The lack of a budget in New York is leading to what could be that state 's first ever government shutdown Tuesday. Correspondent Laura Ingle tells us how it 's all come down to the next few hours. @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!LAURA-INGLE-FOX-N : New York( INAUDIBLE) are nearly $9 billion short in making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Republicans have been unable to reach an agreement running a state through emergency measures while hashing out a deal. @!DAVID-PATERSON-@1D : They have never put a budget on my desk. And the state is running out of money. @!INGLE : Democratic Governor David Paterson says he has no choice but to take the drastic step of a governmental shutdown. @!PATERSON : The combination of the state running out of money and the emergency appropriations that have to be done ever week because there 's no budget compels me to get the savings. @!INGLE : The people in the Empire State would be impacted if the emergency extender bill does n't pass. State employees would go without pay. Unemployment offices would close, as well as state courts, parks and campgrounds, effects that are likely to be felt long after a compromise is reached. @!DAVID-BIRDSELL-BA : When we start thinking of other businesses, both for profit businesses as well as non-profit businesses that are dependent on state contract payments in order to stay in business, if they actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-term unemployment. @!INGLE : Democrats have a slim 32-30 majority in the Senate and were unable to get the votes for the extender bill because of one Democrat and unanimous Republican opposition. Until today, when Republicans( INAUDIBLE) agreed to back the bill. Senate Republican leader Dean Skelos released this statement a short while ago. " The failure to produce the votes to pass this latest budget extender is a failure of Democratic leadership by the Senate Democrats. Republicans will not let the Democrats shut down state government. " @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!INGLE : And since 2002, five states including Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Tennessee have had partial government shutdowns. According to the latest report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, right now, New York is not the worst offender. New Jersey has a $10.7 billion budget gap. Illinois, $13.5 billion, and California holds the number one spot with $19.1 billion. The New York State Senate is still in session at this hour with a vote expected on the extender bill by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes, and we 'll keep an eye on it. Laura, thank you. Stocks were mixed today. The Dow lost 20 1/5. The S&amp;P 500 gave back nearly two. The Nasdaq added a third of a point. If you think thinks are bad now in the gulf, wait until you hear the latest problem brought on by the oil spill. And as the hunt for terrorists continues, we 'll tell you what the U.S. is finding in the mountains of Afghanistan. @!BAIER : In international news, Israel 's cabinet has approved an inquiry into last month 's deadly raid on a Gaza bound flotilla. It will include two foreign observers. Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas says the plan falls short of U.N. Security Council demands. Today, the European Union joined the Palestinians in calling for an end to Israel 's blockade of Gaza. An Uzbek leader says some 100,000 Uzbeks have massed at the Kyrgyzstan border with Uzbekistan following the latest ethnic violence there in decades. The official death toll now is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop the ethnic fighting which resumed last week in the south. The U.S., the United Nations and Russia are working on humanitarian aid airlifts. The " Associated Press " is reporting the State Department is putting together a small army to protect diplomats in Iraq after U.S. troops leave at the end of 2011. The state is asking the Pentagon for heavy military gear and support from private contractors. Today, Iraq 's parliament met for only a few minutes in a symbolic inaugural session. There is word today of hidden riches in Afghanistan that are no longer secret. National correspondent Steve Centanni tells us about an incredible fortune in a very hard-to-get place. @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!STEVE-CENTANNI-FO : Towering mountains and wide-open spaces give Afghanistan a stark beauty, and they conceal what could be a treasure trove of valuable minerals. A Pentagon task force that 's helping connect the Afghan government with potential developers has for the first time put a price tag on this vast mineral wealth, just about $1 trillion. But all that copper, iron, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!PK-CROWLEY-STATE- : Turning to potential of Afghan 's, of Afghanistan 's mineral wealth into actual revenue will take years. And mineral extraction, you know, faces numerous but not insurmountable challenges. @!CENTANNI : One challenge is security. The Taliban and tribal warlords could vie for control of the mines in disputed areas. Another is corruption. Government officials could try to siphon off the profits. President Hamid Karzai, who has promised to clean up that corruption, says his country 's mineral wealth could be worth as much as $3 trillion. @!HAMID-KARZAI-AFGH : It 's exploited well. This is massive wealth, massive opportunity. @!CENTANNI : Lithium is among the most valuable minerals in Afghanistan. It 's in great demand for the batteries that power computers and other electronic devices. But some say there are too many unanswered questions about the profitability of mining lithium in Afghanistan. @!DENNIS-BRYAN-LITH : You know, is there a road nearby, or do you start from scratch? And have they drilled it? I doubt it. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still, there is the prospect of major economic growth for a war-torn poverty stricken country. @!LT-COL-TONY-SHAFFE : When you look at the fact that the Afghan economy 's gross national product is just about $1 billion last year, that 's the official economy, there 's got to be a game changer and this potentially could be that game-changer. @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!CENTANNI : Right now, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, the only mining in Afghanistan is done with picks, shovels and wheelbarrows. A far cry from the massive industrial operations that would eventually be needed if Afghanistan is to realize its massive mineral potential -- Bret. @!BAIER : Steve Centanni live at the Pentagon tonight. Steve, thank you. Afghan President Hamid Karzai is trying to rally support in Kandahar for the upcoming NATO offensive against the Taliban there. Karzai, Sunday, met with tribal chiefs and religious leaders urging them to cooperate. But the real power in the region may not be with the president. Reporter Conor Powell tells us who 's really in charge. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Hamid Karzai 's image looms large. But behind closed doors, it 's the president 's brother that rules the region. Officially, Ahmed Wali Karzai is a member of the Kandahar Provincial Council but according to western officials, he is also the largest drug dealer in Afghanistan and is accused of overseeing a vast network of corruption that fuels the insurgency. @(on-camera) : Many Afghans here in Kandahar say they do n't support the Taliban but given the choice between them or the corrupt Afghan government, they would choose the Taliban. @(voice-over) : The U.S. military was supposed to launch a major operation in Kandahar this month. But it has been postponed because local Afghans( INAUDIBLE). Officials do not blame Ahmed Wali Karzai directly. His strength as a powerbroker has been a major obstacle. Kandahar 's own governor reluctantly says power needs to be more disbursed if the Taliban is to be defeated. @!TOORYALAI-WESA-KA : Yes, powerbrokers are one of the -- is part of the puzzle. It 's part of the problem. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside, U.S. officials are forced to work with him and he is promising to turn over a new lease. @!AHMED-WALI-KARZAI, : That 's been in the past. Now it 's a new beginning. We are working together. @!POWELL : Privately, U.S. officials remain skeptical of the new Ahmed Wali Karzai and acknowledge collaborating with him is a massive gamble. But to blunt his influence, the U.S. is pouring millions of dollars into restructuring the police, courts and local councils, especially the lower district levels. @!WESA : We plan to restructure the district shores. We are trying to resurface some of the people, those who were left behind. @!POWELL : American officials insist success in Kandahar will not be decided on the battlefield but in government offices. But with powerbrokers like Ahmed Wali Karzai running the government, success may be tough to achieve. In Kandahar, Conor Powell, FOX News. @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!BAIER : Iran 's revolutionary guard says new United Nations sanctions will not stop the country 's nuclear program. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation has already shaped its defense capabilities against worse case scenarios. The administration has touted one particular cabinet member numerous times since the gulf oil disaster started. We 'll explain. And a congressman comes up with an embarrassing way to say no comment. @!BAIER : And now some fresh pickings from the " Political Grapevine. " North Carolina Democratic Congressman Bob Etheridge has apologized after the video of the Democrat 's confrontation with a student went viral. Etheridge was, well, visibly irked. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Do you fully support the Obama agenda? @!REP-BOB-ETHERIDGE, : Who are you? Who are you? I have a right to know who you are. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : We 're students. @(CROSSTALK) @!ETHERIDGE : So am I, who are you?

President Obama and White House officials frequently tout Energy Secretary Steven Chu 's credentials while working on the Gulf oil spill, saying they " just happen to have a Nobel prize-winning physicist on our staff. " Chu 's Nobel past has been mentioned ten times since the spill began. " The New York times " article describes an instance where the complexity of capping the oil well was as challenging to the Nobel Prize winner. Quote, " Chu wondered aloud why oil was still spewing from around the bottom. Engineers had to tell him that the leaks were expected. " Bloomberg Ed Chet is leaving journalism to join Natural Resources Defense Council and telling " Politico " the oil spill prompted his decision to resume doing what he called " The lord 's work in fighting climate change. " " Politico " noted the ease which reporters jumped between journalism and advocacy seems to be increasing and that will " likely reinforce notion that all journalists are biased and largely towards Democratic friendly organizations.

Allen had said before returning to " Politico, " " I 'm hopeful I can advance the Democratic Party goals and obviously the congresswoman 's goals. " Our top story at the bottom of the hour, President Obama is back in the gulf region to survey the damage and talk about containment effort for the oil disaster. The president will address the nation Tuesday night. He meets with BP executives Wednesday. Residents of the Gulf States continue to criticize BP for its inability to stop the spill and the delay in processing claims for damages to businesses and livelihoods. Correspondent Steve Harrigan reports now there is another reason people are upset. @(BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE) @!STEVE-HARRIGAN-CN : BP clean-up crews came under scrutiny for the schedules, with some working 20 minutes each hour, resting the other 40 minutes. Now they 're coming under criticism for lax security screening procedures. On this resort island, the contractors are not being welcomed with open arms. @!DEAN-BLANCHARD-SH : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murders, child molesters, all without running background checks on them. @!HARRIGAN : BP has 700 temporary clean-up workers on grand isle and thousands throughout the Gulf, scraping up tar balls and oil in 90- degree heat for $12 to $20 an hour. Many come from private subcontractors who require name, date of birth, and Social Security number for each hire. The data is then turned over to local law enforcement to ensure safety at cleanup sites. But so far, at least three workers have been arrested on outstanding warrants while on the job, for narcotics, assault and child molestation. Local law enforcement officers say the current system is a disaster waiting to happen. @!CRAIG-WEBRE-LAFOU : We 're liable to have a situation with a group of people turn into vigilante force, and then you have a huge wedge where it 's up against them. @!HARRIGAN : What is not clear is what percentage of the contractors are already convicts, currently on prison and on work release programs let out temporarily to clean oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on work release are participating in the cleanup, but they have no accurate figure as many private subcontractors are also using work release labor in the cleanup. @!SHELLY-LANDRY-GRA : They are not guarding them 24/7. They are bringing them in our little town. And we 're having to watch each and every one of them. We do feel like we 're being outnumbered. @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!HARRIGAN : Bret, there is one store in town where the clean-up workers can cash their checks. They often use prison I.D.
