238341 BOB EDWARDS, Host : This is Morning Edition. I 'm Bob Edwards. Two-paycheck families make up half of today 's U.S. labor force. What the means is that American families need child care, a lot more than currently exists. Because good facilities are so hard to find, some parents have to settle for substandard care in addition to possibly feeling guilty about not spending more time with their children. NPR 's John Burnett profiles two families in Austin, Texas who are struggling to do the right thing for their children. morning family activity JOHN BURNETT, Reporter : Seven a.m. - Brian Saunders sp plunges into a bowl of Lucky Charms while his mother, Jerry sp, gets ready to take him to day care. The Saunders moved to Texas from Connecticut last May. Tim is an electrical engineer at IBM. Jerry is a chemical engineer. Brian is three. morning family activity The only thing they miss about Connecticut is the child care. Texas has among the lowest standards in the country. The Saunders learned this the hard way. Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day care and cut his chin. It required nine stitches. JERRY SAUNDERS, Mother : And there was about 35 kids out there supervised by two people, and they just could n't watch all the kids on all the different pieces of equipment at the same time. Since his accident and another little girl broke her arm in the same playground, they 've changed their morning policy. Jerry 's interaction with day care worker BURNETT : Brian goes to a church-run child care center about eight miles from the new subdivision where the Saunders live. When they arrive, the large fenced gravel playground is already teeming with kids. Jerry dropping off son Brian Mrs. SAUNDERS : This is the piece of equipment that he fell from, and you know, I did n't count kids. There 's probably 25 kids or so out here, two or three teachers. So, the good news is he 's only going to be out here for ten minutes. laughs BURNETT : At the end of the day, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creations with an intensity that only engineers could bring to the task. As the quality manager for an out-of-state industrial gas company, Jerry spends 75 percent of her time on the road. When she 's at home, she tries to spend every minute with Brian. She and Tim have considered the idea of trying to live on one salary so one parent can stay home with Brian, but the discussion does n't get very far. Mrs. SAUNDERS : We 've thought about that, and from a career standpoint, it 's probably suicide. TIM SAUNDERS, Father : Taking off five or eight or ten years in an engineering career - you start from scratch when you go back. I mean, there 's no guarantees @!BURNETT interviewing Is that an issue between you all, I mean, about how to sort of structure your lives so that you can spend more time with Brian? Mrs. SAUNDERS : I do n't think it 's really an issue because we spend all of our time with him. We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel schedule and him being in day care, we- when we go anywhere, he goes with us. You know, Tim and I do n't generally go out alone together very often. I think in the three years he 's been alive, we 've been out what, maybe three times without him? BURNETT : interviewing You 've gotten a babysitter three times in three years? Mrs. SAUNDERS : Yeah, something like that. Mr. SAUNDERS : Has it been three? I can only think of two offhand @!BURNETT Jerry and Tim do n't think this discussion should be about parental angst. They think it should focus on child care and specifically why it is n't better in Texas because studies have shown just as bad day care can retard a child developmentally, good day care helps a child to thrive. Mrs. SAUNDERS : We thought about maybe not coming to Texas because of the day cares. Eleven to one for two-year-olds is so far beyond my ability to comprehend. Mr. SAUNDERS : When you talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an eight-hour day or maybe longer in some cases and you have two adults with in Texas ' case up to 22 children, one person is nonstop changing diapers. And what is the other person doing? Looking after 21 kids. You know, then the ratio is not eleven to one anymore. It 's 21 to one. That 's the problem @!BURNETT The situation is so bad, the Saunders have to choose a child care center before they 'd even decided when to have a second child. Jerry has now added her name to the 2-1/2 year waiting list at one of the few centers in Austin with a low five-to-one student-teacher ratio. ambient sound of Collins family interaction voice-over The issue for Jeff and Kim Collins sp is not substandard day care. They consider themselves lucky to have found a small, well-run child care center close to their home. The Collins are seeking the holy grail of the ' 90s - two vibrant careers and ample quality time with their children. This explains the elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two-thirty p.m. - Jeff has just driven 25 miles from his office in downtown Austin to pick up four-year-old Dak sp and three-year-old Madison sp at their day care. After a stop at the house to water the puppy and have a snack, Jeff 's big Chevy van roars back into town. ambient sound of Collins family interaction Three thirty-five - Jeff drops off Dak and Madison at Kim 's office. She 's the associate publisher of a local parents magazine. Then he heads back to his office where he 's the partner of a small financial services company. For the next hour or two, the children will play in their mother 's office while she alternates between business and domestic concerns. ambient sound of office activity voice-over At 4:30, Kim herds the kids into her Volvo and heads for home in the hills west of Austin. They live in a quiet rural neighborhood where white-tail deer are as common as squirrels. ambient sound of home activity Inside the house, she checks one last time for any office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The Collins have tried it all - nannies, relative care, stay-at-home mom and conventional child care. The most ideal arrangement should have been Kim 's job at a large Dallas bank that provided in-house child care, but it did n't turn out that way. KIM COLLINS, Mother : He cried the whole day, and nobody told me, and he was our first child and he was n't doing real well at talking, but he 'd just start getting used to one teacher, and they change in the middle of the day, you know, so that at three, he 'd just about gotten used to her, and she was saying ' Bye. ' You know, and most of them were tired and they were underpaid. They did n't have benefits @!BURNETT At 6:15, Jeff pulls into the driveway. From now until the children 's bed time will be quality time. Both parents agree strongly that too much day care is detrimental, but how to spend more time with Dak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them. The afternoon shuttle is for the time being an imperfect and temporary compromise. Jeff 's ideal is to have Kim stay at home with the children. Kim wants her kids and she wants a career. She 'd love to put a computer and a fax in the house and do more telecommuting while the children are small, but they 've both learned that not every woman is destined to be a full-time mom. Mrs. COLLINS : I thought I was going to lose my mind a couple of days. I was like- Jeff, I called him and I said I 'm just not meant to be a mom. It 's just- I just ca n't do it. So, I mean, I really can understand a stay-at-home mom 's perspective, and it was almost like God looked down on me and said, ' She 's about to go. I need to get her doing something again. ' And this job just came along like that @!BURNETT The Collins and the Saunders have learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while holding down two full-time jobs. One family goes to extraordinary lengths to keep day care to a minimum. The other is adamant about finding the best child care because they know the alternative. For these families and many others, the struggle is worth it because their children 's wellbeing is at stake.
