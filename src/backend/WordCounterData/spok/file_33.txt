224741 PAULA @!ZAHN, co-host : We 're looking at 10 minutes before the hour right now. Catherine O'Hara won sympathy from mothers everywhere when she left her son by himself in " Home Alone. " Well, get out the worry beads, Mom, it 's that time of year again. qwq @( Excerpt-from- " Home @!ZAHN : Catherine O'Hara joins us. That 's the first time Kate McAllister laughed that whole movie. @!Ms-CATHERINE-O'HAR : You know, is n't it? Boy did I appreciate that moment. @!ZAHN : That woman has like no sense of humor. What 's wrong with her? @!Ms-O'HARA : Exactly, thank you. No sense of humor. I finally realized that in the second movie. Just completely straight, does n't get a joke. @!ZAHN : So she 's not as much fun to play as some of these other women you 've played, is she? @!Ms-O'HARA : No. But it 's a different kind of challenge, to fight my own instincts ev -- every step of the way. @!ZAHN : Guilt. Pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was he like to work with? @!Ms-O'HARA : Oh, he 's a demon ch -- no. He 's sweet. @!ZAHN :...( unintelligible), right? @!Ms-O'HARA : No, he 's lovely -- he 's a lovely. @!ZAHN : Is he going to turn out OK? @!Ms-O'HARA : I hope so, God bless him. @!ZAHN : I spent some time with him. @!Ms-O'HARA : Yeah. @!ZAHN : And outwardly he seems very normal and all that stuff, but then you see the coterie of people that he 's surrounded by... @!Ms-O'HARA : Yeah. @!ZAHN :... and you wonder whether he 's going to be robbed completely of his childhood. @!Ms-O'HARA : That 's the frightening part. The people who visit the center, the fans on the street in New York, you know, if they would get too excited around him -- like, they just -- we had to rehearse in his trailer because he could n't go outside. He peeked his head out and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, ' What do you people want from me? I 'm but a child. ' @!ZAHN : Were you there the day Mi -- Michael Jackson arrived on the set to spend some time with him? @!Ms-O'HARA : No, I got out of that rehearsal because I was the only one shooting that night and I begged for hours to get out of the rehearsal -- and he shows up. @!ZAHN : He showed up. Now, you 've created a lot of colorful characters. You like to -- you like to write, you like to create these characters. @!Ms-O'HARA : Mm-hmm. Yeah. @!ZAHN : Now I understand when you were a kid, you used to impersonate a number of people? Let 's put -- This is Your Life, Catherine O'Hara... @!Ms-O'HARA : That evil guy who works with you. No, because I was... @!ZAHN : James Mason. Now you used to do that for your dad a lot, right? @!Ms-O'HARA : Because I was being asked if -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of impersonations because we did them on SCTV but I would learn them for the day. The only -- I never had any repertoire except when I was like 13, I used to do James Mason, Alfred Hitchcock and Paul Lynde, for my dad, basically. @!ZAHN : Can you do any of them anymore? Let 's just try a James Mason. @!Ms-O'HARA : I ca n't imagine at 13 how I did it, but now.( Tries impression of James Mason) James Mason, what sort of li... @!ZAHN : Paul Lynde? Do you want to try Paul Lynde? @!Ms-O'HARA : Imagine what I s -- No. I really ca n't remember that. Sad. Actually, I did the James Mason voice a while ago for an animated film for a vampire. But I 'm not sure they used it. @!ZAHN : Oh you did? Why? Why no -- why would n't they use it? @!Ms-O'HARA : Because it may have sounded like a girl doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are actually working on another project where you are going to sit down and hole yourself up in your house for -- for weeks on end... @!Ms-O'HARA : Yeah, a Christmas special for HBO. @!ZAHN : Do you like doing that? Do you like creating your own stuff? @!Ms-O'HARA : Yes. I 'm -- I 'm very excited that I 'm finally forcing myself into the situation where I have to write something because I have really, you know, just sort of cut off that part of my brain that I used to use so much when I was doing SCTV and I had a deadline and I had to write. And -- and also, it 's pretty frustrating to be just a regular sort of actress waiting around, you know, for somebody else to write you something or to somehow get an opportunity to do a good script. So I 'm excited at the idea of developing my own thing. @!ZAHN : You 're fresh off this amazingly successful Saturday episodes, the numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the credit for that. @!Ms-O'HARA : I do n't know. There was 10,000 maniacs. I think with the elections coming at that time that they were looking forward to seeing Perot and Clinton and Bush. Yeah. @!ZAHN : I stayed up late that night. I happened to see that night -- now I do n't know what I did not see that -- that you witnessed because you claim that was one of the most humiliating experiences of your life. What happened that I did n't see? @!Ms-O'HARA : Oh, it 's just -- oh, this is terrible. Because I -- I, you know, this is nothing against the director, God bless him, because he pulls off that show every week and it 's an incredible feat. But there -- end of a scene had been cut after dress... @!ZAHN : This was the Marilyn Monroe scene you played. @!Ms-O'HARA :... between dress and air. Yeah. Yeah. @!ZAHN : Marilyn Monroe... @!Ms-O'HARA : I played somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I woke up in the morning not remembering anything and having this guy in bed with me that I 'd met at the Halloween party and he was wearing a JFK mask. @!ZAHN : Lovely. @!Ms-O'HARA : But the rest -- the end of the scene got cut and the director did n't turn the page to see it had been cut. So they kept the camera on me and they -- of course, if they do n't put up that applause sign, the audience does n't know the scene 's over. So I just stood... @!ZAHN : So you 're standing out on the stage and nobody is doing it? @!Ms-O'HARA : The most intense moment of live TV. @!ZAHN : But you know what? From a viewer 's point of view, you know, you do n't -- I did n't notice any pause... @!Ms-O'HARA : No, actually, when I saw the tape, it was n't as long as it felt, but when I saw -- oh, it was -- oh, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : No. No. He 's great. It 's not his fault. @!ZAHN : Catherine O'Hara. What a pleasure to see you. Congratulations on all your successes as of late. @!Ms-O'HARA : Thank you. @!ZAHN : Take care. Good luck writing. @!Ms-O'HARA : Thanks. @!ZAHN : We 'll let you go to your apartment... @!Ms-O'HARA : Yes. @!ZAHN :... right now and hole up for weeks and not see anybody so you can get your job done. @!Ms-O'HARA : I 'm going to do that. @!ZAHN : Thanks again. We 'll be right back.
