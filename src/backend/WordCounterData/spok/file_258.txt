5002141 @1CRAIG-MELVIN@2 : Now to our series, The Vote. America 's future, hard to believe, just forty-one days to go until those crucial midterm elections. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : NBC 's Jacob Soboroff has been crisscrossing the country to find out what matters to voters in America 's key tossup districts. And you just got back from Texas, did n't you? @1JACOB-SOBOROFF@2 : I sure did. And as always, you guys, it is not what you think once you get on to the ground. We were down in the 23rd Congressional District of Texas. Washington, of course, buzzing about Brett Kavanaugh 's troubled nomination, the latest twist in the Russia investigation. But down where we were, it felt like we were a long, long way from the drama in our nation 's capital. @5Begin-VT@6 @1JACOB-SOBOROFF@2 : This is a cucumber. It 's covered in chili. It 's delicious. This is a flea market on the south side of San Antonio. And we came here with Gina Ortiz Jones, who is running for Congress, to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a part of community that has traditionally been underserved, underrepresented. @1JACOB-SOBOROFF@2 : What do people want around here? @1GINA-ORTIZ-JONES@2 : Well, look, it 's everything, clothing, backpacks. Look at these boots. @1JACOB-SOBOROFF@2 : I know. These are nice. My wife asked me about my SunBoots. These are awesome. Hey, how 's it going? @1GINA-ORTIZ-JONES@2 : Hi, there. @1RENE-CASTRO@2 @5Texas-Resident@6 : Hi. @1GINA-ORTIZ-JONES@2 : Gina. @1JACOB-SOBOROFF@2 : What matters most to you other than child-sized cowboy boots? @1RENE-CASTRO@2 : My community, you know. @1GINA-ORTIZ-JONES@2 : Yeah. @1JACOB-SOBOROFF@2 : Do you normally go and vote in elections? So not always? @1RENE-CASTRO@2 : Yeah, not always, not always. @1JACOB-SOBOROFF@2 : That 's the thing around here. @1RENE-CASTRO@2 : Yeah. @1JACOB-SOBOROFF@2 : I heard not very many people vote. @1RENE-CASTRO@2 : Well, it 's just business and kids. You know, it gets -- it gets pretty hectic. @1JACOB-SOBOROFF@2 : So what will be the thing that gets you fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help make a difference, especially for the people in the lower-income bracket and so forth and in our people, you know, and -- @1JACOB-SOBOROFF@2 : When you say our people? @1KATHY-NUNEZ@2 : Hispanics. @1JACOB-SOBOROFF@2 : And that 's -- this district is largely Latino. @1GINA-ORTIZ-JONES@2 : Seventy percent Hispanics. Everyone here talks about community. It 's about community. It 's about how we take care of one another, how we look after one another, and how we invest in the future. @1JACOB-SOBOROFF@2 : We are on our way from one of the most populated parts of this district, that little corner of it by San Antonio, where seventy percent of the voters live to one of the most remote parts, Crystal City. And that 's where we 're going to meet the district 's congressman. His name is Will Hurd. How are you? Nice to see you. @1WILL-HURD@2 : The twenty-third district of Texas is larger than twenty-sixth states, roughly the size of the state of Georgia. @1JACOB-SOBOROFF@2 : He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteen of which are Dairy Queens. Do you have a preferred Dairy Queen order by any chance? @1WILL-HURD@2 : When I 'm on my own, it 's a medium dip cone. @1JACOB-SOBOROFF@2 : Yeah, me too. @1WILL-HURD@2 : But I 'm a purist. @1JACOB-SOBOROFF@2 : That 's all fancy. @1WILL-HURD@2 : Yeah. Have a seat. Yeah. Come on. You got to come join us. You got to come join us. Come on. Yeah. Please, please, yeah. What 's your question? WOMAN #1 : We 're one of the highest unemployment rates in the country. I think you know that. @1WILL-HURD@2 : Yup. MAN #1 : My concern is the streets. There 's a lot of potholes everywhere. @1JACOB-SOBOROFF@2 : Potholes. MAN #2 : Major problem is good education for our kids. @1JACOB-SOBOROFF@2 : Why did n't nobody as the first issue bring up what 's going on with the Supreme Court this week or nobody brought up Russia? WOMAN #2 : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only important issues but they affect us immediately here, so the things that we know are going to make a difference tomorrow. @1WILL-HURD@2 : What most elected officials and what the media tried at coverage are not the same conversations you have down here locally. @1JACOB-SOBOROFF@2 : The other thing nobody brought up with Will Hurd was the southwest border. And his district has a third of it. So we headed down there to Eagle Pass to see if we could figure out why. We 're on the Mexico side of the border wall, but still in the U.S. It 's no man 's land. We just met Frank( ph) who works construction but has time off and he 's out here playing golf down on the border. And that 's Mexico right there. That 's the Rio Grande, just on the other side. If you hit the ball far enough, it goes into Mexico. Let it rip, Frank. Not quite to Mexico, but not bad. So what are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy? @1FRANK@2 : Things right now are real slow. You know, I got people I got to pay. I got material I got to pay. @1JACOB-SOBOROFF@2 : So you guys need a strong economy in order for your business to be doing well? @1FRANK@2 : To be thriving, yeah, exactly. @1JACOB-SOBOROFF@2 : This is the Rio Grande right here? @1FRANK@2 : Yeah, it 's the Rio Grande right there. @1JACOB-SOBOROFF@2 : And so, Frank, when you 're out here golfing, are you thinking about, you know, all the politics that people talk about with the border? @1FRANK@2 : No. @1JACOB-SOBOROFF@2 : What do you think about? @1FRANK@2 : Let 's go to work. And what is tee time? Go golf. @5End-VT@6 @1JACOB-SOBOROFF@2 : Who knew, man, a golf course on the border with Mexico. You know, it 's not that voters, guys, are not interested in the Supreme Court allegations, Russia, even the border. They just do n't bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Beto O'Rourke want to win, they 're going to have to get these voters that do n't normally turn out to actually come out and vote on the issues that they care about. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Yeah. They say that all politics are local but you wonder why voter turnout is so low there. @1JACOB-SOBOROFF@2 : it 's such a good question. Texas is a very young state. I think it 's the third youngest state in the country. And young people, millennials, we 've talked about this before, do n't historically go to the polls. They think that the increase in Latino population there will increase voter turnout but it might take some time down there. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : All right. @1CRAIG-MELVIN@2 : Especially in primaries. They do n't vote especially in primaries. @1JACOB-SOBOROFF@2 : That 's right. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Thank you, Jacob. You 're going to have more on your road trip this morning on Megyn Kelly TODAY. @1JACOB-SOBOROFF@2 : Sure will. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Thanks, hon. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Just ahead, Kristen Bell. She 's in a good place for us right here in our studio. We 'll talk about her new show and being an honest celebrity mom after your local news. @5ANNOUNCEMENTS@6 @1HODA-KOTB@2 : It is eight thirty now on this Wednesday morning, September 26, 2018. A little gloomy out here in Midtown Manhattan. But luckily, look at the bright faces we have out here on our plaza. You guys, thank you for coming to see us today. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Yeah. @1CARSON-DALY@2 : Some birthdays. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Little gloomy out here. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Yeah. All right. We have a crowd moment. There are a lot of celebrations going on. @1CARSON-DALY@2 : Yup. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : But there is a young lady who 's celebrating her ninth birthday. @1AL-ROKER@2 : A young -- a -- @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Where is -- @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : I think it 's a young boy. @1AL-ROKER@2 : It 's a young man. Young man. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : A young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Oh. And he 's got the birthday hat. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Chace, how are you? @1CHACE@2 : Good. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : We 're so happy you 're here. Wait, are you supposed to be at school? @1CHACE@2 : Yeah. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Did your mom and dad say it was okay to come see us? @1CHACE@2 : Yeah. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : What time did you wake up this morning? @1CHACE@2 : Two o'clock. @1CRAIG-MELVIN@2 : Wow. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Two AM. @1AL-ROKER@2 : Wow. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Wow. @1CARSON-DALY@2 : Wow. @1CRAIG-MELVIN@2 : Wow. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Y'all, we want to make this -- this birthday really special for you. So all of our anchors have little gifts for you. @1CARSON-DALY@2 : Yeah. @1AL-ROKER@2 : Yeah. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Look. @1CRAIG-MELVIN@2 : Hey. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : A TODAY Show mug. @1AL-ROKER@2 : Here you go, TODAY Show mug so you can drink coffee. @1CARSON-DALY@2 : That 'd be great. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : A happy birthday, Chace. Here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I wanted to get you beatbox. But you 've got a pillow. @1CHACE@2 : Thank you. @1CARSON-DALY@2 : Okay? Good job.

Thank you for coming. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : We love you, sweetie. Thank you. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Happy birthday, Chace. What a doll. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Our birthday boy. Thanks. @1CARSON-DALY@2 : A pillow is nice. But skipping school 's really -- really good. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Yeah. That 's a real present. @1CRAIG-MELVIN@2 : Yeah, that -- that 's the best prize. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Guys, coming up Kristen Bell is here. A lot to talk to her about too. She 's got her hit sitcom. Season three starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2, and a big job she has this week. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Uh-Huh. @1CARSON-DALY@2 : Also, for us golf fans riding high off Tiger Woods and that weekend that he had finally winning. We 've got the prestigious Ryder Cup that gets underway in France later this week. A lot of our Team USA 's hopes are riding on the shoulders of a twenty-five-year-old named Justin Thomas. And Justin just before he hopped on that flight to Paris was nice enough to tee it up with our very own dilly, dilly Dylan Dreyer. Look at that. @1CRAIG-MELVIN@2 : Wow. @1AL-ROKER@2 : Wow. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Cool. @1CARSON-DALY@2 : How cool is that? @1HODA-KOTB@2 : That 's really cool. @1CRAIG-MELVIN@2 : And if you 're -- if you 're looking for a great meal to start your day, you 're in luck this morning. We 're revealing People 's new list of the country 's best places to grab breakfast -- @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : I love breakfast. @1CARSON-DALY@2 : Mm. @1CRAIG-MELVIN@2 : -- including a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mister Al Roker himself. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Al Ro. @1CARSON-DALY@2 : Did they bring samples? @1AL-ROKER@2 : All about the breakfast. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Oh, I love that. @1AL-ROKER@2 : Yeah. Yeah. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : All right. You 've got a check of the weather? @1AL-ROKER@2 : That 's right. Let 's see what we 're serving up as far as your breakfast weather. We are looking at heavy storm stretching from the Northeast in New England, all the way into the Mid-Mississippi River Valley and down into the Gulf. We 're also looking at sunshine out West. Tomorrow that rain continues in the Mid-Atlantic states, all the way into the Gulf Coast and the Southeast. A little cooler in the Plains. But the western warmth will continue. That 's what 's going on around the country. Here 's what 's happening in your neck of the woods. @5Weather-follows@6 @1AL-ROKER@2 : And that is your latest weather. Do n't forget, you can always take us with you when you head out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Show on TODAY SiriusXM Channel 108. And you want to say hi to mommy. @1ANNA-LAUREN@2 : Yeah. @1AL-ROKER@2 : What 's your name? @1ANNA-LAUREN@2 : My name is Anna Lauren( ph). @1AL-ROKER@2 : Anna Lauren. Where are you from? @1ANNA-LAUREN@2 : Atlanta, Georgia. @1AL-ROKER@2 : And where is mom? @1ANNA-LAUREN@2 : She is in Atlanta, Georgia. @1AL-ROKER@2 : Oh, my gosh, could n't make the trip, huh? @1ANNA-LAUREN@2 : Yeah. @1AL-ROKER@2 : And dad 's taking a picture right there. All right. Hi, dad. There you go. All right, let 's go back inside. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Thank you, Al. As we said earlier, we 're so delighted to have Kristen Bell with us this morning. She 's the star of NBC 's hit show The Good Place. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : That 's right. In the first two seasons after entering the afterlife, her character has been on a bit of a roller coaster. Now, it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may still have a thing or two to learn. @5Excerpt-from-The-Goo@7 @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Kristen, good morning. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Hi. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : Good morning. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : This show is so fun. It 's season three. And you 're still not in the good place. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Mm-Hm. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : That is correct. It 's hard to get in, as it turns out. But this season, it 's -- it 's interesting because they send our characters back to earth for a second chance. And this whole season, it 's like I just love the idea behind it because it 's about we 're -- we 're all separated on earth and no one 's getting better. So the whole idea is that we need each other in order to improve. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Aww. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : And the idea that, like, you need your friends to push you to be better, you need -- whether it 's your soulmate or your group of friends, the idea that we need one another to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : You think that 's why the show is kind of broken through. I mean, look, there 's so much stuff on TV. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : Yeah. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : People do n't know what channel to turn to. And somehow this little show -- @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Yeah. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : -- has found its place and found a good viewership. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : Yeah, I think -- I mean, I think the idea is really interesting, to me, at least. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Yeah. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : Like, how do we all share earth together? @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Yeah. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : How are we supposed to be good people? And so they wrap all these, like, kind of like really cool philosophy lessons in, like, really silly jokes. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Mm-Hm. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : So it becomes very digestible. And you can watch it with their kids. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Yeah. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : Like, I hear a lot from people, they 're watching it with their eight, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cool lesson on how to be a good person. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : It does make you think about like, okay, what would heaven be like, what 's the good place? @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : Yeah. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Mm-Hm. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Have you thought -- what would you good place look like? @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : Oh, so many naps. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Yes. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : So many naps. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Just a napping place. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : Yes. And all I would eat is like croutons and mulberries. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Oh. Oh. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : My two favorite foods. Yeah, that would be -- @1HODA-KOTB@2 : How -- you -- you 're away from your little ones right now. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : Yeah. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : And you just said to me before like the -- this is the hardest thing you have to do, is be away from them for a couple of days. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : Yeah. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : How old are yours? @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : Three and five. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Oh. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : Yeah. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that distance? @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : We -- well, I 'm -- @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Yeah. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : -- rarely away. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Yeah. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : We always travel as a tribe. My husband and I only take work when it 's out of the city, when we can travel together. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Is that right? @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : Yeah. So we 'll like, you know, go to Atlanta for two months together or something. But we -- we -- the -- our preschool gave us language to say, you know, mommies always come back. Mommies always come back. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : That 's what you say about Vale. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Yes. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : And it 's -- @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : I do say mommy always comes home. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : Yeah. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Yeah. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : And it 's very helpful. Because then they have that as a mantra. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Mm-Hm. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Well, you know, you were voted, according to a website, the most honest celebrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : I don't. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : So congratulations first of all. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : Thank you. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : All right. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Enjoy your reign. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Yeah. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : So we want to -- @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : It 's because I 'm an oversharer. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Yeah, exactly. So we want to put it to the test. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : Yeah. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Okay. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Answer honestly. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : Oh, Lord. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Okay. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Have you ever let your kids wear dirty clothes? @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : Of course. That 's not even -- where is the honesty part? @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Yeah. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : Like duh. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Yeah. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Okay. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : The answer is duh. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : You drop food on the floor, outside in the grass, you pick it right up and give it to your kid? @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : Yes. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : You 've done it. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 :( Unintelligible) nice. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : No p -- you -- @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what time it is? @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : Yes. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Yeah. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : Yes. Because they ca n't tell time yet. I 've also lied to them about when their birthday is. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Wait, what? What do you mean? @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : Well, like if we -- if it 's like a Wednesday and we ca n't celebrate and we 're both working late, then guess what, your birthday is on Saturday. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Yeah. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : They do n't know. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : I love it. I love it. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : They do n't know. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Have you ever -- has your child ever had a soaking wet diaper and you 're just too tired to change that thing and you 'll say, you know what, you can make it one more hour, you 're fine? @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : No. That I -- @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Yeah. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : -- when it comes to their comfort, I will definitely be on top of that. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convince her to do it. Like I -- if I want -- if I 'm like laying down, I 'll be like pop that diaper off, go grab me a new one and then I 'll -- I 'll lace it up for you. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : When you said grab me a new one, I thought you were going to be like, grab me a beer out of the fridge -- @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : No. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : -- while you 're at it. Have you ever let your kid -- just let them to sit on the screen so you could kind of do your own thing? @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Yeah. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Like online shop or something. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : Very rarely. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Yeah. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Yeah. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : Sometimes. Sometimes. And it 's -- we 've kind of limited it to being nature shows. They 're allowed to watch TV like kids programming on the weekends. But I do find they get in -- I do n't mind it because I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Yeah. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Yeah. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : -- like they all have really great shows now. And when they 're -- when we need to do it on the weeknight or something, we do a -- a nature show because once they watch TV for, like, over an hour, they 're so grumpy. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : They 're grumpy. You 're right. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : So I just do n't want to deal with, like, the aftermath. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Yeah. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : So you 're here to talk about this. But you 're also here in New York for a -- for a really important reason, are n't you? @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : Yes. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Yeah. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : I am speaking at the U.N. General Assembly tomorrow. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Wow. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : And I 'm the first global advocate for the Women 's Peace &; Humanitarian Fund, which is really cool because it 's a very new part of the U.N. It 's a partnership between the U.N. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in five countries. So -- and it 's all for women 's issue. So it takes like a woman in Iraq, who sees the problems in her community. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Yeah. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : It 's not a board making a decision about what they need. She 's saying here 's what I think we need and we give them funding, capacity training, which is like tech management and like how to manage their team. And then, if the idea is successful, we can franchise it around the world so that everyone lives better globally. And it came out of this idea that one percent of global funding is towards women, which it 's ki -- that 's, like, hard to wrap your head around. Certainly women are not the only solution. But like, they 're more than one percent of the solution. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Sure. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : So it 's to really focus on that issue and let women solve their own problems in their own communities. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Yeah. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Kristen, thank you so much. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Go get them. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Talk to us about Frozen 2 next time you 're here, okay? @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Yeah. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : Okay. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Unless you have anything -- @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : I ca n't. I 'm so -- @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : Yeah. I knew -- I knew it. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : -- handcuffed. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : She 's like ca n't say a thing. @1KRISTEN-BELL@2 : I can't. @1SAVANNAH-GUTHRIE@2 : By the way, the season premiere of The Good Place is tomorrow night eight, seven Central right here on NBC. @1HODA-KOTB@2 : Coming up next, Dylan hits the links ahead of the Ryder Cup with one of Team USA 's brightest young stars. But first, this is TODAY on NBC. @5ANNOUNCEMENTS@6
