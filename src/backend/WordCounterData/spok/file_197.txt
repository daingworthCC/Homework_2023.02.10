4102941 @!DEUTSCH, co -host : But I 'm just going to say something that is not official. @!HODA-KOTB-co-host: What? @!DEUTSCH: I know Kathie 's watching right now. I have a crush on her. I do. She 's happily married. I just think she 's wonderful. @!KOTB: You do have a crush on her. @!DEUTSCH: And that 's the absolute truth. I have a crush on her and... @!KOTB: And you... @!DEUTSCH:... that 's -- I just -- I had to say it. @!KOTB: What is it about her? What 's the crush? @!DEUTSCH: OK. All kidding aside. @!KOTB: Yeah. @!DEUTSCH: Because people always ask me about both of you guys. She 's just such a special person. What you see is what you get. And she 's warm and she 's different and she 's interesting. @!KOTB: Yeah. @!DEUTSCH: And she does n't, you know, give a bunk. And I love her. I think she 's just great. @!KOTB: Yeah. And... @!DEUTSCH: All kidding aside. @!KOTB: And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She has long hair. She does n't care. @!DEUTSCH: She has long hair. @!KOTB: Shakes it. @!DEUTSCH: And I think she 's very sexy. I just said it. That 's it. @!KOTB: There you have it. And I 'm fine, Donny, do n't mind me. I 'm just sitting here next to you. @!DEUTSCH: No. I -- well, your... @!KOTB: I 'm good. I 'm good. @!DEUTSCH: Your boyfriend is younger and bigger than Frank, so I do n't want to get in trouble. @!KOTB: All right. So the Emmys were on last night and you watched, yeah? @!DEUTSCH: Yeah. @!KOTB: And what did you think overall? @!DEUTSCH: First of all, with the Emmys, as a guy, you 're very challenged every year because there 's always football on. @!KOTB: Yeah. @!DEUTSCH: And it 's like, football! @!KOTB: Yeah. @!DEUTSCH: Emmys. @!KOTB: Yeah. @!DEUTSCH: Football! Emmys. @!KOTB: Yeah. @!DEUTSCH: I watched the Emmys. What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us girls. @!DEUTSCH: Yes. I thought it was fun. I thought, you know, a lot of people took shots at it. I thought Mark Burnett did a good job. I liked the Charlie Sheen thing. I thought it was just so wacky, a little bit of it. What I like about the Emmys... @!KOTB: Yeah. @!DEUTSCH:... is that they do n't take themselves that seriously. @!KOTB: Yeah. @!DEUTSCH: You know, the Oscars, it 's -- they get up there and they talk about the journey and the craft. @!KOTB: Yeah, yeah. @!DEUTSCH: And everything. It 's movies. Whereas these guys, they 're enjoying it, they love TV. @!KOTB: Have fun. I agree. @!DEUTSCH: They do n't take themselves seriously. It 's just better to watch. @!KOTB: One of my favorite moments was when they did the Best Leading Actress in a Comedy. @!DEUTSCH: Yeah. @!KOTB: And they announced Amy Poehler first. Just the announce -- they were announcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the stage. They did n't -- they did n't announce the winner, they just started announcing the cast. OK. So she acts like she -- then they all get up there and it 's like a big pageant scene. And then Melissa McCarthy ends up winning. I loved her. She was the one... @!DEUTSCH: Yeah. @!KOTB:... she 's in " Mike &amp; Molly. " @!DEUTSCH: Great. @!KOTB: But she also played in " Bridesmaids. " OK. Listen to -- I think we have a little bit of her speech. Do we? We do n't. Because we only can get two minutes. @!DEUTSCH: That 's a perfect example. She was so genuinely happy. @!KOTB: Yeah. @!DEUTSCH: Whereas when Kate Winslet won at the end, the movie star. @!KOTB: Yeah, yeah, yeah. @!DEUTSCH: It was like self-important. @!KOTB: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. @!DEUTSCH: And she was just -- I ca n't believe I 'm here. And it was just great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about she was from Plainfield and she could n't believe she was standing up there. @!DEUTSCH: Yeah. What a cutie pie. @!KOTB: And it was -- it was adorable. @!DEUTSCH: What an absolute cutie pie. @!KOTB: My -- one of my other favorite moments, I loved when Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel, two of the most beloved talk show guys ever... @!DEUTSCH: Yes. @!KOTB:... came out together and they came out to present and it turned into this crazy wrestling match. What it was, was Jimmy Fallon said he did not have an acceptance speech in his pocket and Jimmy Kimmel was going to prove him wrong and he did. @!DEUTSCH: There it is. @!KOTB: And he did. @!DEUTSCH: You know what 's great about Jimmy, also. @!KOTB: What? @!DEUTSCH: When he -- when his series did n't win for best series... @!KOTB: Hm. @!DEUTSCH:... instead of doing a clap that everybody does. @!KOTB: Yeah, yeah. @!DEUTSCH: He was like. @!KOTB: You know. @!DEUTSCH: He just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being funny. He 's just also one of the nicest guys. Both those guys are just such nice guys. @!KOTB: Love them. @!DEUTSCH: They really are. @!KOTB: Now... @!DEUTSCH: Camera does n't lie. Offscreen Voice : Happy birthday. @!KOTB: And it 's Jimmy Fallon 's birthday. @!DEUTSCH: Jimmy. Happy birthday, brother. @!KOTB: We love Jimmy Fallon so much on this show, too. He 's been so kind to Kath and me. @!DEUTSCH: He 's such a nice guy. @!KOTB: He is a great guy. @!DEUTSCH: He is so genuine and he 's so talented and so genuine. @!KOTB: He 's a great guy. Now a lot of people pick this as like the big headline for the whole night and they loved this moment. It did n't resonate as much with me, I do n't know why. Charlie Sheen presented the lead actor award and he got up and he made a little speech and everyone said this was the moment of the night. Why do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From Emmy Awards) From the bottom of my heart, I wish you nothing but the best for this upcoming season. We spent eight wonderful years together and I know you will continue to make great television. Now on to the Emmy. @!KOTB: You know what, I do n't know. I think he 's a better actor than that. I do n't know. I just -- it did n't feel -- I did n't feel it. @!DEUTSCH: It was neither fish nor fowl. It -- like he should have done it with a joke afterwards. @!KOTB: Yeah, yeah. @!DEUTSCH: And it did n't feel like genuine. It was like a little glint of smirk. @!KOTB: Yeah. @!DEUTSCH: It was the right thing to do, obviously. @!KOTB: Yeah. @!DEUTSCH: And the sexiest story is bringing a guy down and now we 're going to bring him back up. @!KOTB: Yeah. @!DEUTSCH: And he will be more than fine. @!KOTB: You do n't think that 's the sexiest story. @!DEUTSCH: It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one person. @!DEUTSCH: No, no, no. The sexy story in the media is taking a guy down... @!KOTB: Whatever. Forget it, forget it. @!DEUTSCH:... and now we 're going to bring him back up. @!KOTB: Bring up your Christina Hendricks. @!DEUTSCH: Yes. @!KOTB: This is all he 's been talking about. OK. This is... @!DEUTSCH: That 's not true. Do n't tell Kathie... @!KOTB: This is... @!DEUTSCH: Here, I said I had a crush on Kathie Lee. @!KOTB: No. No, no, no. @!DEUTSCH: Now you 're going to... @!KOTB: This is Donny 's sexiest girl right here. @!DEUTSCH: OK. @!KOTB: Now please explain, I want you to explain to me. And I think she 's adorable and gorgeous and all that. @!DEUTSCH: OK. @!KOTB: What is it about her that makes her your number one? Go. @!DEUTSCH: OK. Maybe -- I 'm counting. There are 17... @!KOTB: There are two things. What are the two things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I think -- you know, she -- she 's -- I do n't know, she 's kind of like old school glam. You know. I love red hair. @!KOTB: You have to -- you only can pick two things that you like about her. What are the two? @!DEUTSCH: Two things : the dress and the hair. @!KOTB: What are the other two things? @!DEUTSCH: No, OK, I guess the color of her skin. @!KOTB: Yeah, yeah, right. @!DEUTSCH: I just think she 's like old school Hollywood, like Sophia Loren. @!KOTB: Yeah. @!DEUTSCH: That, Gina Lollobrigida, that -- I ca n't keep going like this. @!KOTB: But she was the -- she was your favorite of the night. @!DEUTSCH: I think she was gorgeous. The... @!KOTB: What about Sofia Vergara? She was one of my favorites. @!DEUTSCH: Oh. Another one. Gorgeous. @!KOTB: I loved her dress. I loved Sofia Vergara 's dress and I loved Kate Winslet 's dress. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I loved. I love that look. The red look. What do you think? @!DEUTSCH: Red, red is a hot look. Look, these are gorgeous, gorgeous women. What did you think of Gwyneth Paltrow? @!KOTB: Oh, she wore the midriff. @!DEUTSCH: Yes, yes. @!KOTB: I thought it was gutsy to wear the midriff. She 's bone thin. @!DEUTSCH: Mm-hmm. @!KOTB: I was n't a huge fan of it. What about you? @!DEUTSCH: Yeah. I -- I think she 's beautiful and I think even for her, that was n't flattering. She 's stick thin. And even -- when you kind of wear something and you 're -- you know, I wear those midriffs sometimes also. @!KOTB: Yeah. I 've seen. @!DEUTSCH: You know, I 'm in decent shape. @!KOTB: I know. Uh-huh. @!DEUTSCH: But it just does n't work. I did n't -- I did n't love that one. But you know, it was -- what I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour, they were n't glammed up all over -- every place else. @!KOTB: Yeah. @!DEUTSCH: It was the dress, it was maybe wearing -- I ca n't believe I 'm talking about fashion. I do n't know what the hell I 'm talking about. @!KOTB: Let me ask you a question. @!DEUTSCH: I think... @!KOTB: Let me -- let me -- let me ask you a question. @!DEUTSCH:... purple is coming back. @!KOTB: Let me ask you a question. @!DEUTSCH: What? @!KOTB: OK, because you 've dated many, many women. And let 's pretend -- and we talked about this last week on this show with Kath. @!DEUTSCH: Several. OK. @!KOTB: If you were wearing an outfit and your -- and you turn to your guy and you say, ' Hey, what do you think of this? What if you were going out with Gwyneth Paltrow and you 're going to a fancy dinner and she had this dress on. What would you say to her on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do. First of all... @!KOTB: Honest to God, first thing you 'd say. @!DEUTSCH: Honest to God. I would say, ' You always look amazing. For some reason I 've seen stuff look better on you. I mean, you look great in that, but like you look great in this and this and this and this does n't accentuate what 's so great about you. So there 's a way to do it. Because I think women want honestly. It does n't mean I 'm right. And so I will do -- I 'm not one of these guys that 's like, I want a woman to wear this. I want you guys -- a woman has to feel the way she feels when she feels good in it. @!KOTB: Do you care really what your girlfriend 's wearing? I mean, does it really matter? @!DEUTSCH: Yeah. Only if it was inappropriate at a business meeting or something. @!KOTB: Yeah, yeah, yeah. @!DEUTSCH: No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be who she is and it 's like I will never -- when I hear about these guys that we were talking earlier... @!KOTB: Yeah. @!DEUTSCH:... tell their wives they want them to have blond hair or they tell their wives to wear this. You know, it 's OK to say, ' Hey, I like this. But you 've got... @!KOTB: Yes. Yes. @!DEUTSCH:... a woman is going to be happy if she 's doing her thing. @!KOTB: Yes. @!DEUTSCH: And you 've got to -- I keep doing this again. @!KOTB: Because you ca n't help it. You 're a hands guy. @!DEUTSCH: Yeah. Yeah. @!KOTB: So if you happen to be paging through the pages of Architecture Digest***( as spoken). @!DEUTSCH: Oh God, here we go. @!KOTB: This is an apartment you 've seen. Now I 've only seen it because my book party was in there, but Donny -- this is Donny 's apartment in Architecture Digest. Oh my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at the book party and I 'm sorry. @!DEUTSCH: Yes. There was no furniture in there. @!KOTB: We ruined the floors and everything. @!DEUTSCH: Yes. @!KOTB: But this is your spot. @!DEUTSCH: All right. @!KOTB: Are those your shoes? @!DEUTSCH: I have -- OK. OK. @!KOTB: You are disgusting. @!DEUTSCH: I ca n't believe there 's all these great pictures of my -- and you 're going to go show my shoes. No. I have T-shirts and jeans and long-sleeved T-shirts and sneakers and shoes. That 's pretty much... @!KOTB: Did you design this whole deal, by the way? @!DEUTSCH: I mean, I have a brilliant architect, Fred Schwartz, great interior people at Tony Ingrao. @!KOTB: You have a -- oh. @!DEUTSCH: It 's a really fun, happy place. And I hope you have pictures of my little girls rooms. @!KOTB: It 's white. @!DEUTSCH: Because that 's my favorite rooms. They are... @!KOTB: OK, everything 's white. Who 's room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play room. Look how cute that is. Those are all heart-shaped chairs. @!KOTB: That 's a cupcake? @!DEUTSCH: That 's my dad 's painting in the back there, by the way. That 's just a happy -- my little girls, London and Daisy, the little eight and four. @!KOTB: Yeah. @!DEUTSCH: The most delicious things in the world. @!KOTB: They are sweet. @!DEUTSCH: We do Wii in there, we do the dance thing. @!KOTB: What 's the dance? @!DEUTSCH: Well, the dance, you put on a dance. It 's called -- I forget what it 's called, but you put on, let 's say it 's Britney Spears. @!KOTB: On TV? Yeah. @!DEUTSCH: And you dance and it 's a contest and I usually come out... @!KOTB: You dance with them? @!DEUTSCH: I dance with them. @!KOTB: How cute are you? @!DEUTSCH: Honestly, I... @!KOTB: That 's cute. @!DEUTSCH: If I had more kids, I would want all girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something about daddies and their girls. And I find it less -- this is -- this is going to sound sexist if I do n't mean this right, if I had a boy... @!KOTB: Yeah. @!DEUTSCH:... I would feel I have to mold them and I -- not overshadow them. @!KOTB: Yeah, yeah. @!DEUTSCH: With a girl, I want them to be great, I want to teach them, but I want to take care of them. @!KOTB: But are n't you worried about like when they get to the dating age. And you do have one daughter who 's way beyond that, that 's grown. @!DEUTSCH: She 's grown. She 's 24, yes. @!KOTB: Right. But it 's scary, is n't it, when they get to that age? @!DEUTSCH: I... @!KOTB: How would you navigate that stuff? @!DEUTSCH: Here, what 's interesting, and this is going to be counterintuitive. I talked about this on one of the segments last week. @!KOTB: Mm-hmm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these dads. I do n't want my daughter dating until she 's 30. @!KOTB: Yeah. @!DEUTSCH: I would rather my daughter 's first relationship, maybe when she 's 16 and 17, to be with a loving boy. @!KOTB: OK. @!DEUTSCH: That has a good experience, that -- vs. like not have a relationship until she 's 21 and it be a jerky guy. @!KOTB: Yeah, yeah, yeah. @!DEUTSCH: I just want their first relationships to be happy and make them feel good as a woman. @!KOTB: Uh-huh. @!DEUTSCH: And to me, I 'm not -- you know, and that 's natural at 16 and 17, or whatever that is. @!KOTB: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. @!DEUTSCH: So as a parent, you pick the age, but these -- the guy comes in, I 'm going to hit him with a baseball bat. No. @!KOTB: Yeah, yeah, yeah. @!DEUTSCH: As long as he 's a nice guy. @!KOTB: But are n't you -- you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who might step into your daughters lives? Because there are a lot of jerks. I mean, we 've all dated them so we know. @!DEUTSCH: If they 're jerks, they die. That 's it. That 's it. And you know, they 're never going to love anybody like they love daddy and everybody understands that going in. @!KOTB: Yeah. Exactly. @!DEUTSCH: And that 's -- well, I just want them to be with sweet boys that I can beat up. @!KOTB: By the way, this has nothing to do with anything, but on Sunday, I woke up and I looked on my Twitter and I had been hacked. @!DEUTSCH: What do you mean? @!KOTB: My Twitter -- someone had figured out -- I guess my password and sent out an e-mail on some scam thing like a way to work at home, work -- get a job at home. So people were writing back saying, hey, thanks so much. I 'm going to try this work at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, blah. And I did n't know how to pull it back. If someone retweets something you tweet, you ca n't pull it off. It 's already stuck out there. You ca n't do anything. @!DEUTSCH: You know what... @!KOTB: So it 's a big pain in the neck when that happens. @!DEUTSCH:... there 's too much of everything. @!KOTB: You tweet, do n't you? @!DEUTSCH: I tweet. There 's too much of everything going on. There 's too much interconnectivity. @!KOTB: Yeah. @!DEUTSCH: There 's too -- something is going to go wrong bad. I just -- yuck. @!KOTB: Yeah. You 're -- OK. @!DEUTSCH: Yuck. @!KOTB: All right. So our favorite things. It 's time for our favorite things. Now I am going to go with this. Now it 's the summertime and so you -- I mean, it 's the fall and you 're going to have to put on makeup and all that stuff and I hate putting on makeup on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love this stuff. It is -- you put a primer on your face and then all you do is, it 's like thick base powder. So you do n't have to put a foundation and then a powder. It 's a one-stop shopping all in one. @!DEUTSCH: That. Look at that. @!KOTB: Glow Minerals. Hello. What 's yours? @!DEUTSCH: OK. This is for all the women out there. @!KOTB: Oh yeah. @!DEUTSCH: Forget expensive watches. I love wearing these like G-Shock watches with suits. @!KOTB: They 're... @!DEUTSCH: They 're 100 bucks and it 's like cool. Like who says you have to wear a serious watch with a suit. @!KOTB: Oh, hold up, hold up there. @!DEUTSCH: I mean, look at this. It 's like this one is like glow in the dark. @!KOTB: Yeah. @!DEUTSCH: And it 's just fun. And like these G-Shocks, and so like, my whole thing is... @!KOTB: You would wear this with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!DEUTSCH: Not the yellow one. I wear a white one with a suit. I wear -- I have a -- the dark blue. @!KOTB: What is that telling people? @!DEUTSCH: You know what it 's telling me? It 's a signal. It says, you know, I take myself seriously and I 'm a serious guy. @!KOTB: Yeah. @!DEUTSCH: But I -- there 's a wink going on. There 's something else going on and I 'm not conventional. So I 'm telling you great present for the husbands out there. Enough with the fancy -- who needs an expensive watch? @!KOTB: Nobody. @!DEUTSCH: You know, you do n't need it. It 's irrelevant. And this is like cooler. @!KOTB: It is cooler. @!SARA-HAINES-report: @(Unintelligible) @!DEUTSCH: This is like cooler. @!KOTB: Yeah. @!DEUTSCH: The yellow, I 'm going to put this one on. @!KOTB: Put the yellow one on. Show up. @!DEUTSCH: A pink tie. @!KOTB: What have you got, Sara, what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, this is really good. This is the Mira lip gloss. @!DEUTSCH: I 'm coming over. Why does nobody ever come over here? @!KOTB: They do sometimes. @!HAINES: Sometimes they bring drinks to me. They throw food at me. @!DEUTSCH: OK. I 'm coming over. I 'm coming over here. I want to sit with Sara. @!KOTB: Tell. @!DEUTSCH: We do n't spend any time together. @!HAINES: You can try this out. This is amazing. @!DEUTSCH: OK. @!HAINES: It 's pomegranate, it has SPF 15. @!KOTB: Yeah. @!HAINES: Everyone knows you do n't -- just like your makeup thing. @!DEUTSCH: What, is this something a man would put on? What is this? @!HAINES: Of course it is. Go. It 's $12 at Sephora. @!KOTB: Yeah. @!HAINES: But it has -- oh my God. I 'm going to have to wipe that off. @!DEUTSCH: This is -- this is not like lipstick. This is like lip gloss. @!HAINES: It 's lip gloss. @!KOTB: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!DEUTSCH: Oh no. I 'm not supposed to wear this. @!HAINES: No, you 're fine. You 're fine. You dance with your daughters, you sit on the heart chairs. @!DEUTSCH: Remember the -- remember the football, Emmys. Emmys. @!HAINES: And we -- yeah. He 's owning it right now. This is -- it 's pomegranate flavored, but it like moisturizes your lips. @!KOTB: Right. @!HAINES: But it 's also like you do n't need to put anything else on. You just whip some gloss on. @!KOTB: I like it. @!HAINES: And you 'll look like Donny. @!KOTB: I kind of like it. @!DEUTSCH: I 've got to say something. This is -- now I 'm being completely serious here. @!KOTB: Yeah. @!HAINES: You like it, do n't you? @!DEUTSCH: Why ca n't -- like -- I 'm trying to say this the right way because otherwise I 'm just I 'm revealing too much here. @!KOTB: How does that feel, Donny? @!HAINES: Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't -- this feels good. Like this is... @!HAINES: I know it does. @!DEUTSCH: I would never put this on, well, I would, but I just would n't tell anybody. @!KOTB: All right, kids, kids, not to give you the hard rap. @!DEUTSCH: Look, I 'm sorry, I 'm sorry. @!HAINES: @(Unintelligible) @!KOTB: But I want to say hi to two people that we have standing over there. We have to say hi to a couple of people who are visiting us, Brandy and Laura. Hey. @!DEUTSCH: Hi, guys. @!KOTB: They came to see us, so we 're glad that they came to visit. We 've got a lot coming up. By the way, keep the cutest babies coming. We 've got to show you a couple of pictures here. @!DEUTSCH: They 're all cute. @!KOTB: Remember, ages birth to two and only one entry per person. Look at Savannah. @!DEUTSCH: So cute. @!KOTB: Liam. No, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God, this... @!KOTB: No, all day long. @!DEUTSCH: Let 's just do this for the rest of the show. @!KOTB: All day. Madison. @!DEUTSCH: Look at that face. @!KOTB: Come on. William and Harrison. You guys, go to our Facebook page. @!DEUTSCH: How do you choose? You ca n't choose. Look at that. @!KOTB: Oh, my God! @!DEUTSCH: Look at that. Oh. @!KOTB: Oh. @!DEUTSCH: That 's a punim. We call that a punim. @!KOTB: OK. Look at Hunter. So keep sending your baby 's pictures in. We 're going to keep putting them on the air and we are going to -- we 're going to narrow it down and we 're going to have the cutest baby. We 're going to pick them. I do n't know how that 's going to happen. @!DEUTSCH: How do you pick the cutest? How do you do that? @!KOTB: We 're going to do it. We are going to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? @!KOTB: Oh, we ca n't reveal that right now. @!DEUTSCH: OK. Does Tammy do it? @!KOTB: Anyway... @!DEUTSCH: Actually, I heard Steve Burke is being called in from NBC headquarters to make that choice. @!KOTB: Yes, he 'll take care of it. @!DEUTSCH: Yes. @!KOTB: All right. Coming up next, you guys, Kendra Wilkinson 's wild ride from stripper to new mom and everything and we mean everything in between. She 's with us. @!DEUTSCH: All right. Oh. And then it 's TODAY 'S BUZZ. A look at last night 's Emmys and all the other Hollywood happenings. I was looking at Kendra. @!KOTB: But first, these -- of course you were -- these messages. '
