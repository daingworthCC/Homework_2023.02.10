4031241 MR. DAVID GREGORY : But first, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs. Welcome to MEET THE PRESS. @!MR-ROBERT-GIBBS : David, thank you for having me. @!MR-GREGORY : A developing story I want to ask you about first... @!MR-GIBBS : Mm-hmm. @!MR-GREGORY :... is this swine flu outbreak that began in Mexico, has killed up to 68 people there. We have some images. This is what 's happening on the streets of Mexico City, authorities handing out masks to help stop the spread of this virus. This has hit the United States as well, at least three states where there are infections, thankfully no deaths yet. How serious is this? @!MR-GIBBS : Well, serious enough to be a great concern to this White House and to this government. The president is being briefed regularly by Homeland Security officials. DHS, the Department of Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, the CDC, our Homeland Security Council in the White House are keeping the president up to date on this. We 're following it very closely. We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to have in place in order to deal with any sort of emergency. But it is of concern to this White House and we 're taking... @!MR-GREGORY : Are there preparations for vaccinations, mass vaccinations around the country? @!MR-GIBBS : Well, I think the good news, David, is that over the course of the past several years one of the issues that then Senator Obama worked on was the possibility of what happened in this country if we saw an avian flu pandemic. That resulted in lots of vaccinations being bought, lots of antiviral drugs being purchased and distributed throughout the country in case they were needed. We 'll do a briefing a little bit later on at the White House to discuss some of the preparations that have been undertaken in order to deal with something like this. I think it 's important for the public to understand that we are taking proper precautions to address anything that happens. It 's not a time to panic, and I think that 's important to understand. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being kept aware every few hours of the developments that are going on. @!MR-GREGORY : Let me turn to the issue of interrogation of terror suspects after 9/11, what a lot of people are calling the torture debate. This administration decided to release legal memos authorizing these techniques from the Bush administration. And in light of that release, the president and top officials in the White House have made various statements, and I want to try to take you through these now. April 16th, the president says, " This is a time for reflection, not retribution, " in terms of what should happen next. Then several days later, chief of staff Rahm Emanuel in an interview says, " Those who devised policy, President Obama believes that they should not be prosecuted, and it 's not the place that we go. " You were asked where this all goes on Monday. The question was, " Why are Bush administration lawyers not being held accountable? " You said, " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " And then Tuesday the president again asked what should happen going forward now that these memos are out, and this is what he said. @(Videotape-Tuesday) @!PRES-OBAMA : With respect to those who formulated those legal decisions, I would say that that is going to be more of a decision for the attorney general within the parameters of various laws. @(End-videotape) @!MR-GREGORY : Why the shifting positions? @!MR-GIBBS : Well, David, I do n't think the president has shifted his position. I think what the president said on the Thursday in which the memos were released, all the way through this, he 's been consistent and clear : those that followed the legal advice, the four corners of the legal advice in good faith, those people should not and will not be prosecuted. But the president, as you know, David, does n't determine who knowingly breaks the law or not. That 's set up and devised by the Justice Department and other lawyers and legal entities to decide those questions. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reflection on where we 've been and not for retribution, and that we must look forward. I think the most important thing to understand in all of this debate, David, is the most important step that was taken in the first almost 100 days of this administration relating to this debate was for the president to ban, once and for all, the use of enhanced interrogation techniques by anybody involved in this government. @!MR-GREGORY : But this is about accountability at this stage and looking backward. I want to understand, the president is opening the door for criminal prosecution of Bush administration lawyers. @!MR-GIBBS : Well, but, David... @!MR-GREGORY : Why, why is he doing that? @!MR-GIBBS : But, David, let 's understand. The president does n't open or close the door on criminal prosecutions of anybody in this country, because the legal determination about who knowingly breaks the law in any instance is not one that 's made by a president of the United States. @!MR-GREGORY : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it 's very important. This president campaigned very vehemently on the notion that the rule of law and that legal decisions should be made not by political figures, but by justice figures. Just as scientific decisions about our environment or global warming should n't be made by politicians, they should be made by scientists. @!MR-GREGORY : Does the president believe or suspect that Bush administration lawyers conspired to violate the anti-torture law? @!MR-GIBBS : Well, I, I think that 's a determination that the lawyers are going to make, and they 're going to have to take a look at them. @!MR-GREGORY : There are those who say this is a president who 's playing politics. He is straddling this issue because he wants to appease his liberal activist base who very much wants accountability from the Bush years over this issue. @!MR-GIBBS : Well, I think what 's important for anybody to understand in this is that the, the -- we got to this point on these memos for one reason : there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department and many lawyers throughout the government felt was completely unwinnable. Given that, the president does believe strongly in transparency and believed that there was no legal basis for which to withhold these memos. That 's why they were released. @!MR-GREGORY : Is the view now that a congressional review, some kind of investigation should take place? Is that the president 's view? @!MR-GIBBS : Well, David, right now currently the Senate Intelligence Committee is undertaking a review of interrogation policies and a host of things, given the fact that they have security clearances that allow them to look at different documents. I think this administration believes strongly that if a review is to take place, the one that 's currently being done by the Intelligence Committee is the appropriate place for that. @!MR-GREGORY : Why is that enough, though? Because those who want more accountability would say why a closed hearing in the Intelligence Committee? Should n't there be moral accountability for these practices? @!MR-GIBBS : Well, right. @!MR-GREGORY : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!MR-GIBBS : Well, I think the president had great fears that the debate that you 've seen happen in this town on each side of this issue, at the extremes, has -- that 's taken place would be what would envelop any commission that looked backward. That 's why his focus, David, the whole time is how we look forward in this country. @!MR-GREGORY : So keep it at the Intelligence Committee level, do n't do a bigger truth commission. @!MR-GIBBS : That 's the president 's view. @!MR-GREGORY : Should Democrats be investigated as to why they did n't take more actions to stop this when they were briefed about these practices? @!MR-GIBBS : Well, again, I, I would leave the look backs and the reviews to the Intelligence Committee. @!MR-GREGORY : But you think it should be bipartisan, both Democrats and Republicans should be scrutinized? @!MR-GIBBS : I think, I think that is why the Intelligence Committee is the proper location for this to happen. You 've got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way, I think and we hope, raises this above politics. That 's what 's truly important here. What are we doing, and what steps are we taking to keep this country safe and improve our image around the world? @!MR-GREGORY : As you know, a big part of this debate is the question, do these techniques work? Was valuable intelligence obtained as a result of what some call enhanced interrogation techniques, others call torture? I want to show you two views, one from somebody who was actively involved and another one of the intelligence team members now working for President Obama. George Tenet wrote in his memoir, " At the Center of the Storm, " this : " The most aggressive interrogation techniques conducted by CIA personnel were applied only to a handful of the worst terrorists on the planet, including people who had planned the 9/11 attacks.... Information from these interrogations helped disrupt plots aimed at locations in the U.S., the U.K., the Middle East, South Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dennis Blair, the national intelligence director for President Obama. This was a memo he wrote internally, and The New York Times reported it this way : " High value information came from interrogations in which those methods were used and provided a deeper understanding of the al-Qaeda organization that was attacking this country. " Do you doubt those conclusions? @!MR-GIBBS : Well, David, I, I, you know, I, I do n't think you apparently have the slide where Admiral Blair, the director of national intelligence, says very clearly that, one, you ca n't determine whether any information gotten from any suspect, good or bad, could n't also be gotten by another method. The, the totality of the use of these methods became a rallying cry and a recruitment tool for the very same people that wanted to do us harm, and that in his opinion and the opinion of both many in the administration to deal with national security as well as many that work outside of our administration, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the recruitment tool that they provided al-Qaeda, the notion that you ca n't determine the efficacy of these programs and that you might well have easily gotten any of the information procured this way in a different mean, that it actually makes our country less safe. @!MR-GREGORY : I want to stop you on one point. @!MR-GIBBS : And that it makes... @!MR-GREGORY : You say you ca n't determine efficacy of these programs. As you know, Vice President Cheney and others have said this is not a subjective question, the CIA has additional memos indicating what was gained from these practices. And I know there 's a process under way to review whether those additional memos should be released. @!MR-GIBBS : Right. @!MR-GREGORY : Is it the president 's view that they should be released? @!MR-GIBBS : The president is, and the administration have taken the free -- the request to declassify these memos that Vice President Cheney made March 31st. They 're in the very same process that if somebody else determined that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at by the administration. They 'll be examined by the director of central intelligence, the national security adviser. It 's a process that takes about three weeks. But I... @!MR-GREGORY : But what does he want? Because it seems to me you could really put this to rest if you... @!MR-GIBBS : Well... @!MR-GREGORY :... released what they claim they found. @!MR-GIBBS : Look, I, I think the president, as you know, is a big believer in transparency. I think one of the things that will have to be examined, David, is whether there are additional memos that have to be released that give a broader picture of what 's gone on in enhanced interrogation techniques. There have been many op-eds, an op-ed written by the executive director of the 9/11 Commission in The New York Times on Friday which cast a lot of doubt on whether or not these techniques worked. And this -- these were all the decisions that the president had to make in, in weighing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!MR-GIBBS : But the president and his team and, as I said, many people that work outside of this administration but understand national security and how to keep our country safe, have said quite clearly that the use of these techniques was a rallying cry for the very same people that wanted to kill us, that wanted to do us harm. It made us less safe. It made us more susceptible. And that the president has undertaken very specific actions, one, to end these enhanced interrogation techniques and improve our image around the world so that we can pursue our national interest. @!MR-GREGORY : You 're saying unequivocally that under President Obama none of these techniques would have been pursued. @!MR-GIBBS : The, the president, on the first full day of his administration, signed an executive order that banned the use of enhanced interrogation techniques. @!MR-GREGORY : And at the time he would have done something differently, he would not have done the same things? @!MR-GIBBS : Well, I, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2002. But I think the president believes very clearly, believed in 2002 and believes in 2009... @!MR-GREGORY : Right. @!MR-GIBBS :... that our country does n't have to choose between keeping our people safe and the values that make us America ; that there are things that this country just simply does n't do, David. We do n't step over that line. That 's what this president firmly believes, because he understands that we can both protect our values and keep the men and women of our country and the men and women in uniform safe. Another thing I would mention that I 've heard General Jones, our national security adviser, and others say in meetings, that it is difficult to keep the men and women in uniform defending our country safe if -- because of the use of these enhanced interrogation methods. @!MR-GREGORY : Let me ask you about 100 days. This is a marker that the media pays a lot of attention to, and certainly within the administration you look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the president think or want Americans to judge him? Based on what? @!MR-GIBBS : I think in all honesty, David, he would want the American people to spend a good eight or 10 seconds reflecting on those 100 days but understand, as I know many of them do, they 're not grading us at what we did on the 23rd or 29th or 35th day, but what are we doing and what is the president of the United States doing each and every day to make the American people safer, to improve our economy, to stabilize our financial system, to make their lives a little bit better, help send their kids to college. I think the American people understand that this is, as many in our administration have described, a little bit of a Hallmark holiday. But we 're focused not on what might have happened in the first 100 days, but what has to happen to lay that foundation for long-term economic growth and moving our country forward. @!MR-GREGORY : And before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as press secretary, the president 's spokesman, the face of the White House. I 've covered a few press secretaries, and you have your own distinct style, particularly when it comes to calling out the president 's critics. And you did that when CNBC 's Rick Santelli was -- offered a very high energy critique of the president 's housing plan. Let 's have a look at that. @(Videotape-Februar) @!MR-GIBBS : I would encourage him to read the president 's plan and understand that it will help millions of people, many of whom he knows. I 'd be more than happy to have him come here and read it. I 'd be happy to buy him a cup of coffee, decaf. Let me do this, too. This is a copy of the president 's home affordability plan. It 's available on the White House Web site. And I would encourage him, download it, hit print and begin to read it. @(End-videotape) @!MR-GREGORY : Your colleagues would say you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this job and what do you find challenging about it? @!MR-GIBBS : Well, first of all, David, let me say this is the funnest, most rewarding job that I 've ever had, and it may well be the funnest and most rewarding job that I ever have. It is a lot of work each and every day. You spend hours reading each morning to get ready to answer questions on any number of topics. David, the easy days are when you know that one topic is going to dominate the entire briefing. It 's easier to get prepared. It 's the days that there are 10 or 15 subjects that you know people around the room are going to be interested in. It 's important to have access to and talk regularly with the president of the United States. I 'm asked each and every day what he thinks, and I have to have a good line of communication with him and other senior advisers in the White House to understand the decision-making process and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most fun I 've ever had, it truly is. Sometimes I may have a little bit too much caffeine, but it 's a, it 's a great job. I, I would n't trade it for anything. @!MR-GREGORY : As they say in the press room, no more questions. Robert Gibbs, thank you very much. @!MR-GIBBS : Thanks, David. @!MR-GREGORY : Coming next, our exclusive interview with His Majesty King Abdullah of Jordan on the Middle East peace, Iran, terrorism and the debate over torture. Plus, our roundtable on the Obama administration 's first 100 days with presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin and editor of Newsweek magazine, Jon Meacham, here only on MEET THE PRESS. @(Announcements) @!MR-GREGORY : King Abdullah of Jordan, plus our roundtable with Jon Meacham and Doris Kearns Goodwin after this brief commercial break.
