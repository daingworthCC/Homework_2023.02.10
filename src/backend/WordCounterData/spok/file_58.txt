230641 LARRY KING : Mother said there would be days like this. Good evening. It turned out to be a dramatic day in the O.J. Simpson case. Police scientist Colin Yamaguchi sic blurted out that he first thought Simpson had - quote - ' an airtight alibi. ' The defense attorneys jumped on that, saying they should now be allowed to unseal the statement that Simpson made the police the day after the murders. But Marcia Clarke argued that the jury should not be allowed to see Simpson 's statement. Here to sort all this out, our outstanding legal panel, judged the best in the business, here in Washington, the former attorney general and former governor of Pennsylvania, Dick Thornburgh ; in Los Angeles, criminal defense attorney Gerry Spence ; criminal defense attorney Milton Grimes and former California superior court judge Jack Tenner. We also want to congratulate Gerry Spence. His book keeps staying up there on the best-seller lists. We 'll start with you, Dick. What do you make of all this today? DICK THORNBURGH, former U.S. Attorney General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer to be able to get his client 's story out with no cross-examination and- LARRY KING : Was it a stupid question for the prosecution- DICK THORNBURGH : No, I do n't think so. I think what he was doing was anticipating what the defense would ask him. You know, they 'd asked him, ' Did you have any preconceptions? ' Were they cooking the results in this because they thought that O.J. was guilty. LARRY KING : But they obviously- DICK THORNBURGH : It turned out it was just the opposite. LARRY KING : -did n't brief him well. They should have- he should have just said, ' I did n't, ' right? DICK THORNBURGH : Well, we 'll see. I think the judge is not going to accede to the request of the defense because the- Mr. Yamaguchi sic said clearly that he had heard news reports. He did n't know anything about the statement. He made no reference to the statement. Maybe they can get the news reports into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think they want to do that. LARRY KING : Gerry, if we- if he was referring to the statement, why, then, does it come into evidence? GERRY SPENCE, Criminal Defense Attorney : Well, you know, you- if one side begins to talk about something, then the other side gets to talk about something. It is called ' the goose and the gander rule. ' What 's good for the goose is good for the gander. So the argument here is that the goose - namely, the prosecution - opened up this whole business by talking about the statement of O.J. Simpson. Now, if they could- as Dick said, if they can get this statement in and introduce it into evidence and nobody could cross-examine the statement, they would n't have to put O.J. on the stand and everybody lives happily ever after. That 's what it 's all about. LARRY KING : Judge, was it a prosecutorial goof? JACK TENNER, former California Superior Court Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoided. He should have talked to the witness, if he was going to- what they were trying to do was to block an area of cross-examination because they knew that the witness was going to be asked, ' Did you do this work with the preconceived idea to help the prosecution? ' So what he did then was to say that he read or he knew or learned, or something to the effect, that O.J. had 100 percent alibi. I do not believe that that 's going to open the door and I think that 's going to be the end of it, with regard to this trial. LARRY KING : And Milt, what are your thoughts? Since you usually differ, I 'll bet you say the judge might allow it in. MILTON GRIMES, Criminal Defense Attorney : Well, going along with Mr. Spence 's ' goose-gander ' rule, I think the goose laid part of an egg that the gander would not have been able to get otherwise and I think the gander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simpson had an airtight alibi because I do n't think they would have had any ability to refer to the statement or anything of that nature had it not come out this way. At least they got a part of his alibi in. LARRY KING : Now- DICK THORNBURGH : That egg- that egg wo n't hatch, Milt. That egg wo n't hatch. LARRY KING : All right, key- MILTON GRIMES : Who knows until- LARRY KING : Key query : If he heard about the statement on the radio- DICK THORNBURGH : Ah! Different question. crosstalk Different question. Makes it a much tougher case. But here, he could n't have known about the statement because the statement was made the very day that he was beginning his examination and he said clearly that he heard news reports about what he called an ' airtight ' alibi, so I think the judge is going to keep it out. But it would be- it would be a fascinating legal question if he said, ' I heard about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ' or, worse yet, if he had seen the statement. LARRY KING : Why is the judge doing the hearing? Does he have to do the hearing because the defense called for it, Gerry? GERRY SPENCE : No, he does n't have to do it and that 's one of the things that makes him both a good judge and- and it 's one of the things that causes this trial to go on and on. He 's a very careful judge, wants to listen to every side. And when he makes his rulings, he wants to make sure that he has listened carefully to all of the arguments. But- but he does n't have to and he could- he could do, like our judge right here has done, and look at this like he- like- and read it and says, ' Well, no. ' MILTON GRIMES : He did n't refer to the statement. He just referred to hearing about the statement- LARRY KING : Right. MILTON GRIMES : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to get it in with his Mack truck. LARRY KING : You do n't. MILTON GRIMES : He can try. LARRY KING : So nobody here thinks it 's going to get in. GERRY SPENCE : No. Judge JACK TENNER : I do n't think so. DICK THORNBURGH : I do n't think so. Judge JACK TENNER : Judge Tenner, why did Marcia Clark go- or as, Cochran said, ' ballistic '? Judge JACK TENNER : Well, because she was facing a tough problem. She- she believes that it should n't come in. She also believes that she did n't want to be in this position. She did n't want to argue whether or not O.J. Simpson 's statement can come in without cross-examination and she probably sat at her desk while her associate was asking questions of this witness and probably left a wet spot on the rug. LARRY KING : We 're going to take a break and come back with more. We 'll be including your phone calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful thing about this group. They 're going to be a law firm when this is all over- Gerry Spence, Milton Grimes, Judge Jack Tenner and Dick Thornburgh. Billy Crystal tomorrow night will be heard to explain them. We 'll be back right after this. Judge LANCE ITO, Los Angeles Superior Court : Did you have an expectation? Yes or no. COLLIN YAMAUCHI, LAPD Criminalist : Yes. ROCKNE HARMON, Deputy District Attorney : And what was that based on? DEFENSE ATTORNEY : Objection. Judge LANCE ITO : Overruled. DEFENSE ATTORNEY : Calls for hearsay. Judge LANCE ITO : Overruled. COLLIN YAMAUCHI : Well, like I was saying, I heard on the news that, well, yeah, he 's got an airtight alibi. He's- he 's in Chicago and- you know, that- and it 's his ex-wife and this and that. And I thought, ' Oh, well, he 's probably not related to this thing. ' Commercial break LARRY KING : We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your calls shortly. Milt Grimes, what do you make so far of all the DNA testimony? MILTON GRIMES : Well, I 'm glad that the- I should n't say I 'm glad. I 'm sure the defense was glad that this slip was made this afternoon because the DNA testimony looked overwhelming up until that point. But I think that the defense cross-examination has proven very fruitful. LARRY KING : You think they 're doing a good job cross-examining- MILTON GRIMES : I think they 're doing a good job- LARRY KING : -all the parties? MILTON GRIMES : -cross-examining, creating a doubt, yes. LARRY KING : Judge Tenner, what do you think? Judge JACK TENNER : Well, I 'd have a better opinion if I knew what the defense was going to do with their experts. If they 're going to put on DNA experts, and they certainly have listed some- LARRY KING : Well, we had one here last night who won a Nobel Prize- Judge JACK TENNER : Yes. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a good job of- of- the lab did a poor job. Judge JACK TENNER : Well, I do n't know what the DNA experts for the defense are going to say. I heard your- I heard your guest last night and I think they have some other DNA experts. Are they going to say, for example, that these results do not point to O.J. Simpson ' blood? Or are they going to say, ' You really ca n't tell because they messed up the tests so bad, the way they accumulated the evidence, the way they monitored it and everything else. ' So it 's really hard to say what they 're going to tell the jury with regard to the DNA. But right now, one would have- one would have to say that the DNA experts is- testimony is overwhelming. LARRY KING : Gerry, what 's your assessment so far, DNA to this minute? GERRY SPENCE : Well, I do n't think it makes any difference. I think- LARRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they put on one expert or they put on now three experts. And when you put on one expert, if you believe the expert and he 's a good expert or she 's a good expert, then the DNA is established. If you put two experts on, you begin to muddy the waters and, by the time you get three, people wonder if the first expert and the second were n't good, they must not have been good or they would n't have needed the third. So what happens here is that it 's a question of ultimate credibility of the- of the prosecution. If that jury believes that the prosecution is putting on honest evidence that has n't been fiddled with, that has n't been messed with, they 're going to get a conviction here, based on the DNA. If they do n't believe those experts and they think that somehow behind this is some kind of an insidious proposition that 's going on or that you ca n't believe these kinds of people, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on five more experts or 20. LARRY KING : Dick, your read? DICK THORNBURGH : Well, taken by itself, I think the DNA evidence is devastating, but there are two caveats that my colleagues have referred to, and maybe I 'll just reiterate. One is we do n't know what the defense is going to say. We do n't have any notion of what kind of expert testimony they 're going to have. They have not been terribly effective in cross-examining. The second, I think, doubt that you may have is that these experts and the lawyers who are examining them and cross-examining them, I think, are telling people far more than they want to know about DNA. I think this jury 's eyes glazes over from time to time. I give a lot of speeches and my wife always cautions me, says, ' Do n't dump the whole load. Do n't tell them everything you know. ' You feel compelled to do that and I think they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good. LARRY KING : Before DNA, if this were 11 years ago, Gerry, what- this still was a strong case, was n't it? GERRY SPENCE : Yeah, you could do the- the same thing would have happened with just plain old serology. LARRY KING : Yeah. GERRY SPENCE : And, you know, to somehow say that this serology is bad or this DNA is bad and this DNA is bad and this DNA is bad and this was set up and that was set up and that was set up- all of a sudden, you have to come to the conclusion that maybe none of them were set up. But I agree with- with Dick. The goose and the gander 's eyes both are becoming glazed over. LARRY KING : Dick? DICK THORNBURGH : Gerry, you know, there 's one other thing, too, that I think the defense may have inadvertently done in their cross-examination of these witnesses. They have made this process so complicated- LARRY KING : Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a conspiracy because if somebody was to have arranged all these blood samples around the various sites and had tampered with them, it would take a conspiracy far greater than any has graced the earth to do that, given the types of complications they 've unintelligible So I think they may have shot themselves in the foot a little by being so precise, so painstaking in this cross-examination. crosstalk GERRY SPENCE : Would n't it have been a much better defense if you just said, ' Yes, this is O.J. 's blood, but how did it get there? ' DICK THORNBURGH : Yeah. LARRY KING : Milt, what were you going to say? Judge JACK TENNER : I just want to add that I agree with what Thornburgh said there. It's- it 's possible- if what you want to do- GERRY SPENCE : This has got to stop, all this agreement. Judge JACK TENNER : Well, I 'm not going to do it again- MILTON GRIMES : I disagree with- crosstalk GERRY SPENCE : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Trust me. crosstalk Judge JACK TENNER : I think that what they have- what the defense experts on cross-examination have done is to simply convince the jury that they 're pretty sharp. They know all the terms. They know all the words that nobody will ever remember. They know all the tests that nobody gives a damn about - excuse me - gives a darn about. And- and- but whether or not they have convinced the jury that these tests are so scientific, they must be correct. LARRY KING : We 'll have Mr. Grimes respond. We 'll be taking your phone calls on Larry King Live. Billy Crystal 's with us tomorrow. Mel Gibson on Friday. And do n't forget out big anniversary week coming June 4th. Among the guests, President Clinton. We 'll be right back. Judge LANCE ITO : You asked him a question that elicited ' He 's got an airtight alibi. He 's in Chicago. ' MARCIA CLARK, Prosecutor : That was this witness 's opinion, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defendant 's statement? Which, by the way, does not state that he had an airtight alibi because he was in Chicago. That was not his statement! JOHNNIE COCHRAN, Simpson Attorney : This- this witness was very clear. They brought it out to the jury and now we think we have a right to bring on Mr. Simpson 's entire statement. We have no objection to your honor seeing that statement, no objection to the unintelligible authorities. But we think it 's very, very clear they have opened the door, your honor, with- with a Mack truck. Commercial break LARRY KING : Welcome back to Larry King Live with Dick Thornburgh, former U.S. attorney general, former governor of Pennsylvania ; Gerry Spence, the famed defense attorney, who has not lost a jury trial in 25 years and he 's got a major hit book out ; Judge Jack Tenner, the former California- oh, they got it on Grimes- Milton Grimes, criminal defense- that was my fault- MILTON GRIMES : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King and Judge Jack Tenner, the former California superior court judge. You all know who they are. crosstalk All right, Grimes- DICK THORNBURGH : Californians look all alike. MILTON GRIMES : Mr. Spence, just one second, please. Oh, thank you for that. I was going to say I disagree with Dick Thornburgh. I think the defense has done a very good job cross-examining these experts. I think they have done a sufficient enough job to create some concern, if not doubt, in the minds of the jurors about these experts ' testimony. It is not as absolute and as concrete as we were led to believe when they were presented initially by the prosecution, therefore I do give them some credit in their cross-examination. I think it tended to be a little long, but I do n't think it was overkill enough to unintelligible created total believability in their testimony. As to the two defense theories- LARRY KING : Yeah. MILTON GRIMES : -Mr. Spence and I have disagreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney 's job to attack it from all sides and all angles. If it is O.J. 's blood, and I 'm not conceding that it is O.J. 's blood, as a defense attorney, then it may have come there by some means other than O.J. putting it there and that other means would be that they planted it there. I do n't think they have to just take one theory. And I know Gerry and I disagree with this- disagree with this point, but- LARRY KING : Gerry, you would not have cross-examined at all on DNA, Gerry? GERRY SPENCE : No, that is- yes, I think I would- I think probably I would say if- if you have a- if you- if there is an honest theory that the blood was- was- was- LARRY KING : Planted. GERRY SPENCE : -planted there and that there was some kind of a conspiracy, that that 's your honest theory, then you 'd better be honest about it and stick with that theory. I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell in the courtroom is their credibility and if they do n't have any credibility and they 're all over the place, nobody will believe them. crosstalk Judge JACK TENNER : I think you can have different theories, but each one of them has to have some reliability to them. LARRY KING : Let 's take some calls. Ventura, California- hello. 1st CALLER : Yes. Will the fact that Mr. Simpson 's statements, along with his phone calls, was leaked to the- to a tabloid show- will this give the defense any recourse, as far as- as being able to use this to enter his statement into court? LARRY KING : Dick? DICK THORNBURGH : No. The leaks, of course, bedevil everyone in the criminal justice process, but- LARRY KING : Well, you did answer earlier that if this- if Mr. Yamaguchi sic heard it- DICK THORNBURGH : Yeah. LARRY KING : -on the radio, based on the statement, then that might introduce it, right? DICK THORNBURGH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JACK TENNER : But he did n't ' hear the statement. He heard something about the statement. DICK THORNBURGH : Yeah. Judge JACK TENNER : It was second-, third-hand. DICK THORNBURGH : Yeah. Judge JACK TENNER : He did n't hear the statement, read the statement and use it to make his decision. So I do n't think it 's going to come in. DICK THORNBURGH : No. GERRY SPENCE : I do n't think so. LARRY KING : We 'll be- all of them do not think, despite this hearing tomorrow morning, and it 'll be at 9:00 o'clock tomorrow morning, 12:00 o'clock on CNN, Eastern- they do not think the judge will go with it. We 'll be right back with more phone calls. Do n't go away. Commercial break LARRY KING : By the way, I 've been calling the criminologist ' Mr. Yamaguchi. ' It 's Yamauchi. And we go back to the calls for our panel. San Rafael, California- hello. 2nd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CALLER : Great show. LARRY KING : Thank you. 2nd CALLER : I 'd like to know- I feel that the defense degrades itself every time they attack Marcia Clark as a woman rather than a prosecutor. I see they do n't do this to the men. They do n't attack their manhood or make snide remarks. And what can be done about it, if anything? LARRY KING : What do you make of that? MILTON GRIMES : I do n't think being hysterical is necessarily a sexist statement. I think Ms. Clark 's reaction and attitude this afternoon was hysterical and I think you can describe a man as being hysterical or a woman as being hysterical. I think Marcia Clark bring that attack on herself. DICK THORNBURGH : It 's a code word. crosstalk Judge JACK TENNER : I think the caller is correct. ' Hysterical ' is a word that is generally applied to a woman and generally by a man. Caller is correct. What we can do about it- LARRY KING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, it 's a code word and it 's offensive to most women and I think she- she rightly took umbrage and Johnnie would be well advised to tender her an apology, as he 's done in the past. MILTON GRIMES : I have referred to men as being hysterical in given situations. I 'm sorry to differ with you. Judge JACK TENNER : All right. LARRY KING : And I have taken umbrage and I do n't even know what umbrage is. Gerry, what do you make of this? MILTON GRIMES : Yeah, let 's ask- GERRY SPENCE : Oh, I don't- LARRY KING : Mr. Spence- GERRY SPENCE : You know, I- LARRY KING : -come on, rule. GERRY SPENCE : Please, please. I do n't want in this. LARRY KING : Is ' hysterical ' a feminist term that she should be offended by? GERRY SPENCE : I guess if you're- I do n't know. I don't- Judge JACK TENNER : Well, what about- GERRY SPENCE : If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by words, depending on who you are. Some people are offended very easily and I think we should all be careful about the words that we use. Sometimes I use words that I should n't and Imogene keeps me pretty well posted on those words, but sometimes I slip over. So I 'm not going to be too critical with anybody because sometimes I do it. crosstalk MILTON GRIMES : Gerry 's right in that I was- LARRY KING : One at a time. MILTON GRIMES : I was teasing the judge earlier about his comment about Marcia leaving water on the floor. I said, ' Watch out. The feminists are going to say you would n't have said that had that been a man. ' Judge JACK TENNER : My wife is going to give me hell as soon as I get home. LARRY KING : Sapphire, North Carolina- hello. 3rd CALLER : Yes. My question is to all of the panel. LARRY KING : Sure. 3rd CALLER : What do they- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defense that their expert DNA witnesses have not written a total brief and presented it to the court? LARRY KING : Who wants to- Dick, you want to explain that? DICK THORNBURGH : Well, I would defer to Judge Tenner- crosstalk LARRY KING : What are they asking for? Judge JACK TENNER : Let me tell you what they do out here in California. If the expert that 's hired by anyone writes a report, the other side has the right to get it. And so what has developed in California is the expert will give a verbal opinion to the side that hired him and he will not write a written report, so that the person or the party that hires him can always say, ' We would give you a written report. The reason we 're not giving it to you is it has n't been reduced to writing. ' And if you recall today, Ito said he could n't believe it. He could n't believe that these well-known experts, at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to writing. LARRY KING : By the way- MILTON GRIMES : There 's no requirement in the law- Judge JACK TENNER : I do n't think- I do n't think they have reduced it to writing. They do n't have to reduce it to writing. MILTON GRIMES : Right. Judge JACK TENNER : And that 's why the other side wo n't get it. LARRY KING : So if they do n't have to, Gerry, is it just a way of getting around the law? GERRY SPENCE : Well, that 's part of the game, is n't it. I mean, what they- the intent of the law is that there be no people hiding in ambush and that everybody knows what everybody 's going to say and what everybody 's going to do. If you 're defending a man or you 're prosecuting for the state, you want to know what the other side 's witness is going to say before you go into court so you have some chance to prepare proper cross-examination against that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We did n't put it in writing and therefore you ca n't get it and therefore you ca n't prepare yourself and therefore, indeed, we 're going to ambush you. ' And so if that 's the law, and I take it, it is, because our good friend, the judge, says it is, then the law must be changed and it can be probably changed by court rule. LARRY KING : Milt, what do you think of young Renee Montgomery, the last witness before Mr. Yamauchi? MILTON GRIMES : She seems to be more stubborn and a harder witness than what her physical appearance would portray. She 's holding her own. She 's holding her own. LARRY KING : We 're going to take a break and come back. We 've got a half hour to go and a lot more phone calls with Gerry Spence, Milton Grimes, Judge Jack Tenner and Dick Thornburgh. Many in the media think it 's the best panel in the business. We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Tomorrow night, Billy Crystal will join us. And during our anniversary week, June 4th, among the guests will be Barbra Streisand, Clint Eastwood and David Letterman. We 'll be right back. JOHNNIE COCHRAN : We- we certainly are n't going to yell it, your honor, and become hysterical. We would- I 'd just point out that- MARCIA CLARK : I- I object to that characterization- JOHNNIE COCHRAN : Well- MARCIA CLARK : -your honor. That kind of personal attack is very improper and inappropriate. The court knows that it was simply advocacy. I 'm not yelling at anyone. And for Mr. Cochran to make that kind of sexist remark, ' hysterical, ' I take great umbrage at it and I think the court should not countenance that kind of behavior. Judge LANCE ITO : I do n't. JOHNNIE COCHRAN : Is she finished? Commercial break LARRY KING : We 're back on Larry King Live in Washington with Dick Thornburgh, the former U.S. attorney general, and, in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Milton Grimes, another famous defense attorney, as well, and Judge Jack Tenner. We go back to the calls. Luton, England- hello. 4th CALLER : Hello, there. Good morning from England. LARRY KING : Hi. 4th CALLER : Whatever the people involved might say while the trial is in progress, do the panel believe that once the trial is over, there 'll be any changes in police procedure, evidence gathering and DNA testing methods? Or will everyone just breathe a sigh of relief that it 's all over and carry on as usual? MILTON GRIMES : I 'm sure- LARRY KING : A great question. We 'll start with Mr. Spence. GERRY SPENCE : Well, you know- MILTON GRIMES : I 'm sure everybody will benefit from this trial and techniques and styles will improve. GERRY SPENCE : Your name must be ' Mr. Spence. ' MILTON GRIMES : Did he say ' Mr. Spence '? LARRY KING : I said- it 's okay, Milt. MILTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, you 're acting hysterical, but it 's okay. MILTON GRIMES : Oh, please! LARRY KING : Gerry? GERRY SPENCE : Well, you know, that 's such a- it 's such a good question because this whole case finally comes down to an attitude that the police have to the black community in this community, or have- have, at least, in the past, and that attitude that results from that by the black community toward the police, so that there is a schism there that 's hard to breach- or that 's hard to bridge and it causes a lot of trouble in the courtroom and it causes people to say, ' You know, this evidence is n't believable, ' even if the evidence is believable. So- so I think the caller- LARRY KING : Will it change things? GERRY SPENCE : The caller puts his finger on it. Before we can have a good justice system, you have to have a police system that treats people right and a police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't have that kind of a police system, the court system ca n't work any better than that. LARRY KING : Dick? DICK THORNBURGH : Gerry 's absolutely right, but I 've got three suggestions that I think are going to be on people 's minds when this is over. Number one, from the very outset of the trial, a gag order on all the lawyers who are involved in the trial of the case- no statements to the media. GERRY SPENCE : Yes. DICK THORNBURGH : Number two, I suspect there 's going to be some pressure, if there 's a hung jury or an acquittal, for a less than unanimous verdict. I do n't happen to approve of that- GERRY SPENCE : No. DICK THORNBURGH : -but I think there 's going to be strong pressure for it, particularly in California, where they can proceed by these propositions. The third thing is, and it revives an observation I referred to before made by Judge Learned Hand about expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a ' court 's witness, ' a court expert, to get away from these high-priced experts arguing with one another on a partisan basis. LARRY KING : Judge Tenner, will it- you 're a veteran of the California system. Are we going to see changes based on this trial? Judge JACK TENNER : Well, as I 've said on this program before, I 'm disturbed that certain lessons will be drawn from this trial because this trial is an aberration. You can go into the criminal courts house downtown in Los Angeles and go into each court, and there 's many on every floor, and you wo n't find this situation. I think that, as Thornburgh said, there 's going to be a move that you do n't have a unanimous verdict, which would be a disaster, in my opinion. There 's going to be all kinds of moves on the voir dire examination. Should you allow the judges- the lawyers to do it? Right now, they 're barred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it. There 's going to be all kinds of limitations out of this trial. With regard to what Dick just said about the court appointing an expert, there is- that 's permissible now in California. And even though the judge can appoint his own expert and the jury is told he 's appointed by the court, the parties can still bring in their own experts, but as a practical matter, when the judge appoints an expert, he or she 's going to carry more weight than anybody. MILTON GRIMES : I would hope that there would be improvements, like I said earlier, in things like the collection of evidence, things like the police officers with backgrounds like Mark Fuhrman- maybe they will be scrutinized and looked at a little closer by the police department now. Those are the kind of improvements I would hope would come out of this trial. LARRY KING : Toronto, Canada- hello. 5th CALLER : How are you? LARRY KING : Hi. 5th CALLER : I agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SPENCE : Yes? 5th CALLER : This afternoon, when Marcia Clark was talking about- I think she said ' series 357, ' and Judge Ito was- you know, did n't agree with her- what is ' series 357, ' briefly? GERRY SPENCE : Ask the judge here. MILTON GRIMES : No, it was evidence code 357. GERRY SPENCE : It 's evidence code- crosstalk Judge JACK TENNER : I think she was referring to an evidence code section that is now a part of the law. MILTON GRIMES : Three fifty-six. crosstalk Judge JACK TENNER : Yes, evidence code- DICK THORNBURGH : Hearsay exception. LARRY KING : Is that- is that what the hearing 's about tomorrow? DICK THORNBURGH : Yeah. MILTON GRIMES : No, it 's about whether or not part of- Judge JACK TENNER : No. MILTON GRIMES : -a statement, if used, means that you can- you have to go and get the entire statement. And that 's evidence code- Judge JACK TENNER : I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TENNER : -is going to make the ruling- MILTON GRIMES : That 's what the hearing 's about. Judge JACK TENNER : -based on a hearsay exception. I think what he 's going to make it is just simply looking at some cases to see the precedents in California, to see if this kind of a statement requires amplification from the other side. And I do n't think he will. crosstalk LARRY KING : I thought he was only going to hold hearings late in the day, so the jury would n't be late in the morning. Will this be a quick hearing tomorrow? Judge JACK TENNER : I think he 'll do it based on the briefs that are submitted, without an additional hearing. LARRY KING : Oh, you do n't think, then, we 're going to have an extended argument in the morning. Judge JACK TENNER : I do n't think so. LARRY KING : And you all think he will hold with the prosecution and not- GERRY SPENCE : Yeah, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope the judge is watching this- MILTON GRIMES : And it 's to- GERRY SPENCE : -television program. He should not get his rules of law from us. MILTON GRIMES : And it 's to decide- well, I think I know that rule of law. It 's 356 and it is to decide whether or not the reference to part of the statement will allow the entire statement in. GERRY SPENCE : That 's right. MILTON GRIMES : That 's what- LARRY KING : And will both sides produce law to back them up? GERRY SPENCE : Oh, yes. DICK THORNBURGH : They better. crosstalk They 're working right now, I 'm sure. LARRY KING : Which is what makes it tough to be a judge, right? DICK THORNBURGH : Yeah. LARRY KING : Right, Jack? DICK THORNBURGH : Even tougher to be a trial lawyer. Judge JACK TENNER : Right. It 's easier to be- easier to be a judge than it is to be a lawyer. GERRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to see him back? Judge JACK TENNER : Yes. All together- one, two, three- we are thrilled to have you back. MILTON GRIMES : Good to have you back, Larry. crosstalk LARRY KING : We 've been missing each other. I 've been off a couple days, out away, and then- crosstalk MILTON GRIMES : We thought you did n't like us, Larry. DICK THORNBURGH : Do n't get hysterical, Larry. LARRY KING : I love you. I- we 're together forever! We 'll be back with our- with more phone calls for our distinguished panel. By the way, we 've been kidding them a lot, but would n't that be some law firm- Spence, Grimes, Tenner and Thornburgh? You walk in there, boy, whoever you get, you 're going to be okay. We 'll be right back. Commercial break LARRY KING : We 're back with our panel and your phone calls. Louisville, Kentucky- hello. 6th CALLER : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person, if I were to be placed on the jury, where does the truth come that we can have people such as the defense misrepresent the truth? I see it on T.V., but I know the jurors do n't see it right now. Is this going to be making a mockery out of the jury, and when they get out, they 're going to say, ' Gosh, ' you know, ' I believed him and he was n't telling the truth '? And how- LARRY KING : Are you basing this on what you see and what the jury does n't see? 6th CALLER : Yes. And I 'm saying, when they come out, are they going to think, as I would, if I came out and saw that the defense had misrepresented the truth in order to- LARRY KING : To what are you referring? 6th CALLER : I 'm referring to, well, first of all, the picture that they showed at the very beginning. I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ label over the American Journal picture and it- I believed him that the police were walking through the evidence, the blood. LARRY KING : All right, Dick. You're- you 're shaking your head ' No. ' What- where is she off? DICK THORNBURGH : Well, there are two things here. I got to stick up for the defense. I think what people may style, as the caller did, as a misrepresentation could be just a difference in interpretation of evidence. That 's what the case is about. The jury 's got to sift through differing views of the evidence and they 've got to come to a decision. The other thing I think that has to be pointed out is that- and I 've referred to this before, that a trial really is n't a search for truth. What it is, it 's a burden that 's imposed on the prosecution to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt and it 's the burden on the defense to create a reasonable doubt. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The truth falls between the cracks? GERRY SPENCE : Oh, that- DICK THORNBURGH : It can. LARRY KING : Gerry? DICK THORNBURGH : Gerry thinks otherwise, I know. GERRY SPENCE : Well, I don't- I do n't think that it 's the burden on the defendant to create a reasonable doubt. I think the burden- DICK THORNBURGH : No, not a burden. I- you 're absolutely right. It 's their task, however. GERRY SPENCE : Well, I think what the defendant wants to do in the trial is to test the evidence and make sure that it 's honest and to make sure that the prosecution does bear its burden to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. But you know, this- this woman is saying something that troubles me, too. You know, the trial that a jury hears is not- they do n't get to- they do n't get to hear all of the evidence. They only get to hear the evidence that the judge gets- says they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. DICK THORNBURGH : Yeah. GERRY SPENCE : So here is the whole evidence and here is some of the evidence that we hear and here 's some of the evidence that they hear, but they do n't hear it all. And so, ultimately- LARRY KING : You would n't change that, would you? DICK THORNBURGH : Yeah. GERRY SPENCE : Ultimately, you find out that- it- the case that the jury hears is the judge 's case, not the lawyers ' case, but the judge 's case, not truth 's case- PANELIST : off-camera Well- GERRY SPENCE : -but the judge 's case. And so now this woman says, ' What happens when this jury comes out and finds out that the judge 's case, ' that is, the case that was presented to the jury, ' is not the whole truth and maybe they 've made a decision that affects the lifetime or the future of an individual and they say, ' If I 'd have known all of the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PANELIST : off-camera Well- GERRY SPENCE : I think that 's what she 's worrying about. And every juror goes through that in every case. DICK THORNBURGH : You know what the biggest barrier to truth is, is the United States Constitution, and rightfully so. It says you ca n't compel the defendant to testify, so we may never- MILTON GRIMES : Fifth Amendment. DICK THORNBURGH : -hear from the defendant. It says that you exclude evidence that 's been illegally obtained, which might be relevant. So that 's why I get back to my point. This is n't really in the way that we think of- LARRY KING : No, let's- crosstalk Let 's let Mr. Tenner and Grimes give their thoughts. Jack? Judge JACK TENNER : Well, I had a case in which the confession was- was not allowed into evidence and the jury found him not guilty. And they talked to the different parties and the witnesses and everything after they rendered their verdict. And I had one juror to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had confessed, I would have voted for guilty, ' but, of course, they could n't know that because the confession was barred. MILTON GRIMES : I think this lady, though, has said that the defense has presented- and she did n't say ' lies, ' but she 's saying that the defense has not presented the truth and they are playing tricks. I do n't think that the defense in this case have played tricks. I think the defense has done their job as to opposing evidence that is coming in against their client, but I do n't think they have lied or played tricks- crosstalk Judge JACK TENNER : I would like to say to the caller, please keep in mind that the defense has so far not produced one witness that they have called. MILTON GRIMES : Right. Judge JACK TENNER : So don't- let 's be sure that we understand that what they 're doing now is dealing with the prosecution 's witnesses. They have n't produced one word of evidence or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a final opinion on this trial yet? MILTON GRIMES : You should n't. DICK THORNBURGH : Absolutely. Judge JACK TENNER : You should n't have one. DICK THORNBURGH : You should not. crosstalk LARRY KING : You should have no opinion, right? You have n't heard all the- Judge JACK TENNER : As a matter of fact, if you sent the jury out right now and demanded a verdict, they would have to find it ' Not guilty. ' LARRY KING : We 'll take a break and be back with more. This is Larry King Live. By the way, during our anniversary week, which commences June 4th with a special highlights of the past 10 years, the president of the United States will be with us and Barbra Streisand. We 'll also have Barbara Walters and Tom Brokaw and Mike Wallace, Ted Turner, from the Middle East, King Hussein, Yasir Arafat, Shimon Peres. We 'll have David Letterman and Clint Eastwood. What do we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge LANCE ITO : It 's hard for me to believe that expert witnesses of the caliber that I 've seen on the defense witness list have n't prepared reports. It 's hard to believe that counsel could proceed to make opening statements and make certain representations as to what 's coming in the defense case without having reports. Commercial break LARRY KING : We 'll tell all the members of the panel that a lot of callers are calling in- callers- many callers calling in with technical questions about DNA, lines and matches and the like. And since you 're all lawyers and judges, but also lay people with regard to this, what do you do when you have to make a judgment, Gerry, and two people say, ' This line means this, ' ' This line means that '? What do you do when you 're a lay person? GERRY SPENCE : Well, the first thing you do is you look for somebody in the courtroom- this is why I 've been talking about credibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust. You look for a witness that you trust. You look for a lawyer- LARRY KING : So whoever you trust the most- GERRY SPENCE : Is- there is- LARRY KING : -is who you go with? GERRY SPENCE : And there has- and, you know, there 's a marvelous- people, lay people, have a marvelous ability to kind of feel, to kind of have a knowledge about- LARRY KING : Of course, they get it in- GERRY SPENCE : -who is credible and- LARRY KING : They get it in complicated medical cases, do n't they, where- GERRY SPENCE : -to who is- LARRY KING : -doctors disagree? MILTON GRIMES : Yes. GERRY SPENCE : Absolutely. And you- and, you know, if you 've got- if you 've got two witnesses who are testifying to the same thing and they're- and they are powerful witnesses and they are well qualified, who are you going to believe, this one or this one? And I tell you what you do. You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checks out and feels their- their credibility. That 's what it 's finally all about. LARRY KING : Milton, would you add anything? MILTON GRIMES : They 're going to have to hold on to their common sense- GERRY SPENCE : Yeah. MILTON GRIMES : -and decide it, just like they decide other important things in life with their common sense. LARRY KING : In other words, ' I believed- he made more sense than she did ' or ' She made more sense than him and I go with her. ' MILTON GRIMES : Yes. ' According ' - Judge JACK TENNER : What bothers me- MILTON GRIMES : ' According to my past and my experience and my common sense, I 'm going to base my decision on this. ' Judge JACK TENNER : What bothers me about these so-called ' expert witnesses ' is that I have reached the tragic conclusion that, at least in Los Angeles and California, you can get the best-qualified expert to testify to whatever you want. crosstalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I don't- Judge JACK TENNER : No, they 'll all have a curriculum vitae as long as your arm. They 'll say that the doctor was guilty of negligence or he was n't. They 'll say the accident happened this way or that way. He was going 60 miles an hour or- LARRY KING : Judge, you 're indicting the whole system. Judge JACK TENNER : No, I 'm indicting the use of expert witnesses- DICK THORNBURGH : Hear, hear. Judge JACK TENNER : -because of what 's happened to them. LARRY KING : Boy. Judge JACK TENNER : I agree with Dick that if we had the court-appointed expert, he might carry more weight. MILTON GRIMES : You know, I 'm not so sure that science allows you to be absolutely correct and that we are going to have two versions of the same occurrence or the same event and that 's just the way it is. GERRY SPENCE : That is true. LARRY KING : When we come back, we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apt quote he 's been dying to get in from McBeth. We shall hear what that is following these messages. Do not stray far. Commercial break LARRY KING : Hold it, folks. We have two quotes coming your way, one from Bill Shakespeare and one from Dick Cavett, who just called Gerry Spence. First Shakespeare, courtesy of Thornburgh. DICK THORNBURGH : Shakespeare- LARRY KING : McBeth. DICK THORNBURGH : Shakespeare always had a word for it and I think he has some advice for these jurors who may be suffering from boredom and fatigue after hearing all this blood evidence. LARRY KING : Pray tell, what did he say? DICK THORNBURGH : McBeth said, ' I am in blood stepped in so far that should I wade no more, returning were as tedious as go o'er. ' So hang in there, jurors. LARRY KING : And Mr. Spence, what did Mr. Cavett say? GERRY SPENCE : Well, Mr. Cavett quotes Oxford dictionary and this is the quote from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ' womb, ' defined as functional disturbance of the nervous system, especially for women. ' So Cavett says that when you say somebody is hysterical, it is a sexist comment. MILTON GRIMES : But the popular-day use of the word is not sexist. That 's my only position. Judge JACK TENNER : Cavett is absolutely right. MILTON GRIMES : Oh, he 's not. DICK THORNBURGH : I 'm for Cavett. LARRY KING : Okay. Cavett wins, three to one. Shakespeare wins, four to nothing. State College, Pennsylvania? MILTON GRIMES : Are we going to use a unintelligible 7th CALLER : Hello? LARRY KING : Yes? MILTON GRIMES : Then get me one. 7th CALLER : Hello? LARRY KING : Go ahead. 7th CALLER : Oh, okay. Mr. Yamauchi 's answer to the question that caused the big flap today- LARRY KING : Right. 7th CALLER : He said he heard on the news that Mr. Simpson 's statement- according to his statement, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't say ' according to his statement. ' He just said, ' I hear he has an airtight alibi. ' 7th CALLER : He heard it on the news- LARRY KING : Right. 7th CALLER : -that he had an airtight alibi, was in Chicago, and he said- how could he state that if he had n't seen the statement that the police have? MILTON GRIMES : He heard it on the news. crosstalk He heard it. He did n't see it. LARRY KING : But how did the news hear it? 7th CALLER : Well, that 's what I- MILTON GRIMES : They heard it from someone else, but he did n't see the actual statement and that 's going to be the requirement of evidence code section 356, that he actually saw the statement and used part of the statement- LARRY KING : Yeah, but- MILTON GRIMES : -in forming his opinion on- crosstalk LARRY KING : I could make an argument for the other side here, could n't I, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. LARRY KING : -if you heard it on the radio- MILTON GRIMES : Oh, yes. LARRY KING : -that 's still from the statement. MILTON GRIMES : Oh, I think the creativity- Judge JACK TENNER : The more interesting thing- MILTON GRIMES : -of the defense is going to say that he had used part of the statement and therefore the whole statement should come in. Judge JACK TENNER : The more interesting thing is the statement was never released by anyone. The police have n't released it. The defense have n't released it. So how do we know what 's in that statement? LARRY KING : And, of course, the defense is perfectly willing to have the judge read it and read it to the jury, right? PANELISTS : Absolutely. They want it in there. Sure, they do. LARRY KING : Because it 's self-serving, right? DICK THORNBURGH : Yeah @!PANELIST off-camera Right. DICK THORNBURGH : It 's got to be. LARRY KING : Okay. So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow. We 'll go back to the DNA. The prosecution told someone today that the case is going to- their side of the case is going to go through July. Are you surprised at that, Gerry? GERRY SPENCE : Well, it 's gone on long enough. I 'm not surprised because everybody still has camera-itis. And once- once we get over camera-itis, why, the case will close. Once we 're tired of looking at them and once we wo n't look at them anymore, then the case will get finished. LARRY KING : Milt, when do you think that 'll be? MILTON GRIMES : I do n't know. Rocky sic Harmon said this morning they 're going to take as long as they need to explain any detail they feel they have to explain. It could go on to in perpetuity. crosstalk GERRY SPENCE : I think it 's going to go on for quite some time because the prosecution still has to present the coroner 's report. That is 80-some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be cross-examined for three or four weeks on that 80-page report. LARRY KING : Well, the joy of that is we get to be with you a lot out there and here. And this panel assembles frequently @!PANELIST off-camera That 's right. MILTON GRIMES : We love you, Larry. LARRY KING : Love you, guys @!PANELISTS All right. We love you, Larry. LARRY KING : Thanks, fellows- Gerry Spence, Milt Grimes and Jack Tenner and Dick Thornburgh. Who loves you? Anyway, guys, thanks very much for joining us. Tomorrow night, Billy Crystal will be here to interpret tonight 's show. Do n't miss it. Thanks for joining us and good night. Copyright 1995 Cable News Network, Inc..
