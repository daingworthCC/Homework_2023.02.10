228641 BOB @!SCHIEFFER, host : And joining us here in Washington now, James Gannon of The Detroit News ; at our CBS Chicago bureau, Jon Margolis of the Chicago Tribune. So with the primaries coming up in Michigan and Illinois on Tuesday -- why do n't I start with you, Jim? You just heard Jerry Brown. The fact is, his message is cutting through out there in Michigan, is n't it? @!Mr-JAMES-GANNON-@1 : Jerry Brown saw a political vacuum there in Michigan with the dropout of -- of Governor Hark -- or Tom Harkin of Iowa who was labor 's candidate and he 's moved in to fill it and he 's done -- done it pretty effectively. So he 's -- he 's running strong enough to threaten Paul Tsongas with a third-place finish, but Governor Clinton is -- is way ahead. According to The Detroit News poll we published this morning, Clinton has 49 percent -- almost half the vote -- and Brown and Tsongas about even, looking at who 's -- who 's second. @!SCHIEFFER : So at this point it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe Jerry Brown sneaking in there in -- into second place. Let 's go out to -- to Illinois and talk to Jon. How 's -- what 's the news out there, Jon? @!Mr-JON-MARGOLIS-@1 : Well, the news out here is Clinton bigger and at least as big. Looks like he 's going to get about -- he 's running about 50 percent in the polls and Brown is not doing as well here as in Michigan. He 's doing more like he did in the -- in the earlier states, more like in the single digits. @!SCHIEFFER : So what happens? I 'd like to ask both of you now. Let 's suppose that Paul Tsongas finishes third in Michigan, finishes second in Illinois. Can he go on or is he done for? Jon. @!Mr-MARGOLIS : Well, he can go on. He can try to go on and hang into New York, hoping that New York will be very different from Illinois, which it has been in the past on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, in this case, why New York would be any different. And I think we have to look to the possibility of a situation which you have Bill Clinton, the nominee presumptive, being challenged by a very interesting gadfly, Jerry Brown, who can win a couple of primaries down the road and who can be, at the very least, an interesting factor and make the debate lively. Whether he can get nominated is another matter. @!Mr-GANNON : I think Jon 's right. Jerry Brown is going to become Bill Clinton 's Pat Buchanan, the dog nipping at the heels, all along the way -- probably all the way to California. Paul Tsongas, if he does lose both Michigan and Illinois, I think probably will -- may attempt to go on, but I do n't see how he 's going to be able to raise a lot of political money for a big state like New York to really be compet -- competitive there. @!SCHIEFFER : Jerry Brown made a -- talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting interpretation of it when he -- when he noted that 52 percent of -- of people polled -- and I do n't know what poll he was speaking of, but I know there are a number of polls like that -- suggests that the people are not satisfied with the candidates. @!Mr-GANNON : Right. @!SCHIEFFER : Wha -- what do you think this means for the fall? @!Mr-GANNON : Well, I think... @!Mr-MARGOLIS : I think -- go ahead, Jim. Go ahead. @!Mr-GANNON : Excuse me. He was talking about The Detroit News poll this morning that did show that about half of the people in Michigan would like to see someone else in the race. Of the -- of the three, they clearly favor Clinton. It 's not an endorsement of Brown, obviously. But I think, frankly, it 's sort of an academic question. If Bill Clinton wins both Michigan and Illinois on Tuesday, all this talk about somebody entering the race -- I think it will all go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should bear in mind that usually people -- it 's not unprecedented for people to say, ' Gee, I wish there were somebody else running. ' There 's a -- there 's a kind of an old-fashioned American skepticism about politicians which, if anything, is rising these days. And I do n't even necessarily think this is such a terrible reflection on the candidates. I think this reflects a -- an old-fashioned American disinclination to -- to trust politicians too much, which is healthy. @!SCHIEFFER : Well, you know, I may get a jaundiced view because, being based here in Washington and covering the Congress, most of the people I talk to are in the Congress. But I have to tell you, elected officials that you talk to in this town are as nervous as cats about -- about this Democratic ticket. Now I 'm talking about Democrats now because they -- they -- over and over they tell you that they have this uneasy feeling that there 's something back there regarding Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're just worried about it. Do you, Jon, think that Clinton has passed this? Has he... @!Mr-MARGOLIS : Well, I have not been given the gift of clairvoyance, and I do not know what the future is going to hold, and I 've always found it a full-time job to try to figure out what did happen and what is happening. Well, we can see now from, apparently, a new national poll plus the Tribune poll this morning based just on Illinois is that Bill Clinton is competitive with George Bush. Now this may say more about Bush 's problems than about Clinton 's strengths, but I think that nobody knows what may happen, what may come out, if there 's anything else, any other damaging information about Bill Clinton or about President Bush or anyone else that can come out. On the basis of what we know now, we have two vulnerable but not -- but fair -- also somewhat impressive candidates for the fall. @!Mr-GANNON : Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in Washington about that issue of electability and what I hear when I go out to Michigan, as I have a number of times to do focus group interviews with people, and they rate Clinton the most electable candidate. They think he can win the South, they think he reaches out to blacks effectively. You know, the stuff about he ca n't get elected is not what you hear from voters. Now something could happen to Clinton -- another damaging disclosure that might change that -- but as of now people have listened to those disclosures and basically decided there are other issues they 're focusing on. @!SCHIEFFER : Is there any issue this time around other than the economy? @!Mr-GANNON : Not in Michigan. It 's absolutely overwhelmingly the economy. And it 's hard to get voters to really talk about anything else. And -- and you can see with the way the candidates are campaigning that they agree with that. @!SCHIEFFER : Do you think at this point that George Bush could carry Michigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very close race. Our poll this morning shows Clinton in a test race as the November nominee as slightly ahead of Bush, but close enough so that it would be a tight race. If the economy stays as bad as it is in Michigan, I think it will be very hard for Bush to carry Michigan again as he did in 1988. @!SCHIEFFER : Jon, we have about 20 seconds. @!Mr-MARGOLIS : Yeah. I think -- as I said, our poll showed it pretty even with Bush against either Tsongas or Clinton. I think if the economy -- this may be Bush 's low point, but remember it also may be Clinton 's low point. He 's a very good campaigner. As people get to know him, they may get to like him. I do n't know. @!SCHIEFFER : Well, I 'll tell you one thing -- it 's a different kind of a political year. @!Mr-MARGOLIS : Oh, it is. @!SCHIEFFER : We 'll be back in just a minute. @
