241841 @!JIM-LEHRER : Good evening. Im Jim Lehrer. On the " NewsHour " tonight : the news of this Thursday ; then todays Iraq war debate in the House ; plus, how it looks to Democrat John Tanner and Republican Eric Cantor ; treatment and other medical perspective on breast cancer, following the recurrence announcement by Elizabeth Edwards ; and the poetry of Palestinians, our second story on the Middle East told in the words of poets. @(BREAK) @!JIM-LEHRER : The U.S. House began debating a war funding bill today with a pullout timetable. The measure mandated combat troops leave Iraq by September of next year. The president warned he would veto anything with a deadline. Defense Secretary Gates said, unless something passes soon, the Army will have to cut back training and maintenance. @!ROBERT-GATES-Secr : I think its my responsibility to let everybody involved in the debate know the impact of the timing of the decisions. I think that thats about as far as I should go. @!JIM-LEHRER : It was unclear if Democrats had the votes to pass the bill tomorrow. In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will have more on this story right after the news summary. The secretary-general of the U.N. had to duck for cover in Baghdad today. It was Ban Ki-moons first trip to Iraq, and the first by a U.N. secretary-general in more than a year. The explosion rocked the heavily guarded Green Zone, where Ban was speaking alongside Prime Minister al- Maliki. No one was hurt, but the rocket left a crater just 50 yards away. Moments earlier, Ban had praised improvements on the ground in Iraq. He said he was considering sending more U.N. help. Three more American troops have been killed in Iraq. The U.S. military announced that today. It also said U.S. forces captured the leaders of a Shiite insurgent group. Theyre accused in the killing of five American soldiers last January. And, in southern Iraq, Basra was under an indefinite curfew, after a Shiite militia clashed with a rival group. The Senate Judiciary Committee authorized subpoenas today in the firing of U.S. attorneys. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some Republicans, want White House political adviser Karl Rove and former counsel Harriet Miers to testify publicly under oath. The president has insisted on private interviews with the aides and no transcripts. Today, Republican Senator Arlen Specter urged the Senate committee to consider another alternative and prevent a standoff. @!SEN-ARLEN-SPECTER- : I counsel my colleagues -- both Democrats and Republicans -- to work hard to find a way to avoid an impasse here. We do nt know a constitutional confrontation. Theres enough bickering in the Congress. @!JIM-LEHRER : Specter proposed open hearings with transcripts, but the witnesses would not have to be under oath. But the committee chairman, Democrat Patrick Leahy, said the White House had already rejected that idea. @!SEN-PATRICK-LEAHY- : What were told we can get is nothing, nothing, nothing. Were told that we can have a closed-door meeting with no transcript, not under oath, limited number of people, and the White House will determine what the agenda is. That, to me, is nothing. @!JIM-LEHRER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidents original offer is non-negotiable. And, in Saint Louis, Attorney General Gonzales vowed again he would not resign. He spoke as he began a series of meetings with U.S. attorneys around the country. @!ALBERTO-GONZALES- : At the end of the day, we have a situation where the president of the United States has the authority to hire and to fire United States attorneys. Im going to be going up to the Congress and providing further clarification about what happened here. We are working with Congress voluntarily. No United States attorney was fired for improper reasons. @!JIM-LEHRER : The looming confrontation in Washington involves eight U.S. attorneys fired last year. But, in a new report, " USA Today " said three of them ranked in the top 10 of all 93 federal prosecutors for conviction rates. They worked in California, Arizona, and New Mexico. A Justice Department spokesman said the rankings were skewed by large numbers of immigration and drug cases in border regions. A former Justice Department lawyer has accused political appointees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged, the industry lied to smokers about the dangers of cigarettes. Sharon Eubanks told " The Washington Post, " top Bush appointees in the Justice Department weakened the case two years ago. Those officials have insisted there was no political meddling, only honest disagreements. An internal investigation agreed with that assessment. British police arrested three men today in the London transit bombings in July of 2005. The suicide attack killed more than 50 people and wounded at least 700 others. We have a report from Angus Walker of Independent Television News. @!ANGUS-WALKER : The two men, aged 23 and 30, arrested at Manchester airport at 1:00 this afternoon were hoping to board a flight for Pakistan. It was a preplanned operation carried out by detectives investigating the July the 7th London bombings. By the middle of the afternoon, the operation had widened. And another man, aged 26, was arrested at a House in Leeds. Searches are continuing at another five properties in Leeds and at a flat in a separate business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be questioned here at the high-security Paddington Green police station in West London, and theyre being held on suspicion of the commission, preparation, or instigation of acts of terrorism. The investigation into the July the 7th bombings is described by Scotland Yard as the biggest criminal inquiry in English history, and its still ongoing, code-named Operation Theseus. Immediately after the attacks, police in Leeds searched a number of addresses. There were more than 800 witness statements, 3,500 calls from the public. And officers analyzed more than 6,000 CCTV tapes. But, two years on, detectives still have unanswered questions. Who else, apart from the bombers, knew what they were planning? Did anyone encourage them? Did anyone help them with money or accommodation? That inquiry is worldwide, with significant investigations continuing in Pakistan, involving British detectives and MI6, hunting the possible masterminds of the bombings. Most importantly, to date, no one has been charged in connection with the 7/7 attacks, the first time suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombings were the worst attacks in London since World War II. Back in this country, Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards announced today his wifes cancer has returned. Elizabeth Edwards was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004, when her husband was seeking the vice presidency. Today, she said the cancer has spread to the bone, but its treatable. The couple spoke in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. John Edwards said they never thought seriously about quitting the presidential race. @!JOHN-EDWARDS-@1D@2 : The campaign goes on. The campaign goes on strongly. Elizabeth and I have talked at length about this already ; talked with our children about it. Basically, as I mentioned earlier, we have been confronted with these kind of traumas and struggles already in our lives. And we know from our previous experience that, when this happens, you have a choice : You can go cower in the corner and hide or you can be tough and go out there and stand up for what you believe in. @!JIM-LEHRER : We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program tonight. Federal banking regulators warned today they lack authority over the high-risk mortgage market. Growing failures of so-called subprime loans have roiled the stock market lately. At a Senate hearing, federal agencies said its going to get worse. Sandra Thompson of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had this exchange with Republican Senator Richard Shelby. @!SANDRA-THOMPSON-D : Theres about a million loans that are scheduled to have their interest rates reset this year, and that means that theyre going to have these payment changes. @(CROSSTALK) @!SEN-RICHARD-SHELBY : And that means that interest rates are going to go up on them? @!SANDRA-THOMPSON : Yes, sir. And, next year, in 2008, theres just over 800,000 adjustable -- rate mortgages that will have their interest rates reset. @!SEN-RICHARD-SHELBY : So this -- we are probably just touching the tip of the iceberg, maybe, as far as subprime ; is that fair? @(CROSSTALK) @!SANDRA-THOMPSON : That would be a fair statement to say, sir. @!JIM-LEHRER : Democratic Senator Christopher Dodd complained, regulators should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit. The agencies agreed, but they said financial companies that make subprime often fall outside their oversight jurisdiction. The European Union today approved a deal with the United States to open transatlantic air routes to more flights. Its designed to increase competition and drive down fares. The agreement lets European airlines fly from anywhere in Europe to any city in the U.S. American carriers will have similar rights. The agreement takes effect a year from now. On Wall Street today, the Dow Jones industrial average gained more than 13 points, to close at 12461. The Nasdaq fell four points, to close at 2451. And thats it for the news summary tonight. Now : the war debate in the House ; Elizabeth Edwards cancer announcement ; and poetry by the Palestinians. Trying for a vote in the House on funding the Iraq war. " NewsHour " congressional correspondent Kwame Holman begins our coverage. @!KWAME-HOLMAN : On the eve of the highest-profile vote of Speaker Nancy Pelosis three-month tenure, it was still unclear whether she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ties funding for the Iraq war to the withdrawal of troops. @!REP-DENNIS-KUCINIC : It is time to end the war. @!KWAME-HOLMAN : Some of the most staunchly anti-war members among the Democrats have said they will vote against anything that continues military operations in Iraq. Party leaders hoped the bills language requiring all combat troops be withdrawn by September 2008 at the latest would sway the dissenters. But it has nt swayed Georgia Democrat John Lewis, himself one of the leaderships vote-counters. @!REP-JOHN-LEWIS-@1D : I am not prepared to vote for another dollar, another dime to support this war. It is time to bring our young men and our young women home. @!KWAME-HOLMAN But Democratic leaders point out that their bill would bring home troops even sooner, if the Iraqi government fails to meet certain political and security benchmarks outlined by President Bush in January. @!REP-STENY-HOYER-@1 : And, if there are no consequences for them not meeting them, the probability of them being accomplished are very small. @!KWAME-HOLMAN : But deadlines that could lead to troop withdrawal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill, fearing they could compromise the militarys ability to make decisions. Thats a viewpoint shared by almost all 201 Republicans, who appear united against the bill. @!REP-MIKE-PENCE-@1R : Congress may declare war. Congress may choose to fund or choose not to fund war. But Congress may not conduct war. @!KWAME-HOLMAN : Faced with such a potentially tight vote and only a 32- seat majority, Democratic leaders added to the bill $24 billion in additional spending, including nearly $4 billion worth of agriculture relief, much of it directed at farm state Democrats. Illinois Republican Mark Kirk accused Democrats of trying to buy votes with fiscally irresponsible pork-barrel projects. @!REP-MARK-KIRK-@1R@ : It would provide $25 million in a bailout for spinach farmers, another $74 million in taxpayer dollars for peanut storage, and $283 million for milk producers. All of this spending is designated under the bill as emergency wartime supplemental appropriations. @!KWAME-HOLMAN : Democrats, however, focused on their claim that the time had come to put restrictions on President Bushs Iraq policy. @!REP-PETER-DEFAZIO- : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to escalate and continue a stay-the- course, open-ended commitment to a war, a war that was launched with massive deception, an unnecessary war. @!KWAME-HOLMAN : With 218 votes needed for passage, Democrats can only afford to lose only 15 of their own members. Leaders are leaning on their freshmen, such as Georgias Hank Johnson, who, this afternoon, remained publicly undecided. He said his constituents want to bring the troops home, but that thats not so easy to do. @!REP-HANK-JOHNSON-@ : Well, I think the people of the 4th District, by and large, are ready for this war to come to end ; and they want to see a cessation of deaths of United States soldiers in combat on the streets of the Iraq. And they want to see that happen now. And, politically, the reality is that you just cant yank the troops off the streets. You just cant leave them without the funding that they need in order to wind this process down. @!KWAME-HOLMAN : If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate, it still faces the threat of a presidential veto, even though the Pentagon reportedly is desperately in need of the troop funding. @!JIM-LEHRER : And to Margaret Warner. @!MARGARET-WARNER : For a closer look at the debate in the House, were joined by two members who are deeply involved in rounding up votes for opposing sides on this bill, John Tanner of Tennessee, a chief deputy whip for the Democrats. He s also a leader of the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of moderate House Democrats. And Eric Cantor of Virginia, he s the chief deputy whip for the Republicans. Welcome to you both. Congressman Tanner, beginning with you, why is this vote such a dilemma for the Democrats? @!REP-JOHN-TANNER-@1 : Well, I think any vote on war and the related consequences of war is a difficult vote for anybody who holds public office, Democrat or Republican, because youre dealing with the most serious aspects of our job, and that is sending young Americans possibly to their death. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, maybe as some do, as a partisan issue. And I said as much the other day in " The Washington Post. " @!MARGARET-WARNER : And do you think you have -- youre one of the vote- counters -- the 218 votes you need? @!REP-JOHN-TANNER : I do nt know. I guess my title would be that. But I think, on matters of war, that members have to exercise their own judgment and their own conscience, and be mindful of the people they represent. I think this vote has been mischaracterized to some degree, because I feel like this is a message that is being sent to the Iraqis, not to our troops. We do nt have to send a message to our own people. But we do need to send a message to the Iraqis. Look, this has been four-plus years now, four years and three days. We have lost over 3,000 people. We have lost over 25,000 wounded. The Iraqis have had Saddam Hussein taken out. They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now for over a year. And we see no progress on them. The benchmarks in this bill are the ones the president proposed in the State of the Union. Funding for the troops, in support of the troops, is never withheld under any circumstances in the bill. And I have come to the conclusion -- I served four years on active duty during Vietnam days and then 26 years in the Army National Guard. I have come to the conclusion that its time for them to step up. I am past the point of asking young military families in this country to continue to die and the American taxpayers to spend $2.5 billion a week in Iraq to help people who are seemingly unwilling or unable to get along. And, while theyre shooting at each other, both sides are shooting at us. I do nt -- I think its time for us not to be the policemen on the beat in the city of Baghdad. Were not talking about leaving the area. Were not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a message to the Iraqis : Look, its time for you people to get along. Were not going to stay here open-endedly, shedding our blood and our taxpayer money forever. @!MARGARET-WARNER : So, Congressman Cantor, what are the Republicans saying, that it is an open-ended commitment? @!REP-ERIC-CANTOR-@1 : Well, first of all, I agree with John that this is a question of moral conscience. I mean, this is one of the most serious votes that one takes as a member of Congress, without a doubt. But, somehow, that characterization has not penetrated. But I think the reason why it has nt penetrated is what you see going on, on the other side of the aisle. When you look at a bill like this -- and it is porked up with $24 billion of spending -- and you just ran some of the clips -- of -- for spinach farmers, for -- for peanut farmers, for disaster relief, things that really are nt related to a wartime emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some on the other side have insisted upon, in order to be able to then vote, I guess, against their conscience and vote for the bill. And I think thats really where we stand right now. Our side is committed to making sure that we do not tie the hands of the commanders on the ground, that we give our troops everything they need. And, at the end of the day, we do nt want to send a message to our enemies that 08 comes, and thats it, with no plan after that. And thats where I would take a little bit of difference with John, that, you know, the -- the message here is, to the enemies : Were going to cut off all taxpayer funding in 08, so all you have to do is sort of wait around until then, and rearm, and strategize about what to do. The fact of the matter is, we are in a long-term war against terrorist organizations that have state sponsors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world for free nations, such as America or our allies. @!MARGARET-WARNER : And let me just ask you a follow-up. How many of -- how united is the Republican caucus here? You did have, for instance, 17 defections last month, 17 Republicans who voted to disapprove of the presidents troop surge. Can you hold most of them on this vote? @!REP-ERIC-CANTOR : Absolutely, Margaret. I think the difference here is, our troops are on the ground now. We do not want to put them in any type of situation where they do nt have what they need, where they do nt understand that their Congress and the American people are behind them. Our conference is united. And I think that also explains sort of some of the difficulty in why this bill has nt come to the floor yet. @!MARGARET-WARNER : Congressman Tanner, you -- as a Blue Dog Democrat, you only declared your support for this bill yesterday. Now, you described some of the reasons why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you to come to, and do you think it is shared by some of your fellow Blue Dog Democrats? @!REP-JOHN-TANNER : Well, I have been traditionally been opposed to a timeline. But let me tell you why I did nt : because it wasnt written. And I did nt know what was it was. And I would love to see it before I decide whether or not Im going to be for it. Its finally been put together. And, as I said, I came to the conclusion that the alternative -- and we must pass a supplemental of some kind. The Army says that. From my military experience, I know that we have to pass a supplemental of some sort. And, so, I wouldnt have written the bill exactly like its been written. But Im sure Eric, as when they were in the majority, voted for some bills that had some stuff in it that he may not have agreed with line by line. We all have to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative is -- is what I said, an open-ended commitment of our blood and treasure, and with no pressure on the Iraqi government to make the necessary changes, like sending their troops into Baghdad that are trained, supposedly, unless we do this. And, so, Tom Friedman, as you may recall, said that this timeline would be the best instrument that General Petraeus could have to make the Iraqis step up to the plate now, after four years. I mean, you can only put a square peg in a round hole -- or try to -- for so long. And I think that this is a first step. And, of course, nothings forever. If things go better, and the benchmarks are met, who knows what we can come back and visit. But, until the Iraqis understand that, every time something goes wrong, the Americans are going to be there to fight, die, and -- and, as I said, were spending $200,000 a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our taxpayers, and particularly these young military families, to do this forever. @!MARGARET-WARNER : Yes. So, Congressman Cantor, let me ask you about the situation on the ground and the security plan that General Petraeus is now trying to implement. The president said this week there were some hopeful signs after a month. One, do you agree with that? And, two, how is that -- how is that situation affecting the debate unfolding in the House now? @!REP-ERIC-CANTOR : Well, I do think that the reports, early reports, out of the Petraeus plan have been positive. I think everyone is reticent to go and predict success across the board. It is a very tough situation there, as John has described. You know, war is never easy. And its not pleasant for Americans to see young -- our young men and women dying on the battlefield. But I think the way that that impacts this debate is that we want to give it our all and to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try and micromanage this war. The president has put forward the Petraeus plan for victory. And we want to give that an opportunity to work. And we want to send a message to our troops that we stand behind them, and we do nt want to tie their hands or their commanders hands in executing their mission. @!MARGARET-WARNER : So, let me ask your Democratic counterpart. Are -- are you all saying -- are the Democrats saying that you think the Petraeus -- the whole security plan, thats just hopeless? @!REP-JOHN-TANNER : No. I hope it works. General Petraeus himself has said that there is no military solution. This timeline business thats caused us so much consternation around here is the one tool that will make the Iraqis step up to the plate. Thats what we all want. And, so, when General Petraeus himself says its time for a political and diplomatic solution, this, I think, is the right way to go. I -- as my military background tells me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NATO parliamentary delegation -- I chair it -- to NATO. We are in danger of losing the momentum in Afghanistan, Im fearful, because of this situation in Iraq. Look, these people, the Shiite and the Sunni, have really been in a hot-and-cold war off and on since 632 A.D., when Mohammed died. Now, if they can -- I hope they can come together. But theyre going to have to do it. We have done -- the American people have spent 3,000 dead, 25,000 wounded, and almost $400 billion over the last four years. This war is going on almost as long as World War II, if not longer. And, at some point, if the Iraqis are unwilling or unable to do something -- were not talking about leaving. Were not talking about in any way impacting the commanders options. In fact, this timeline is way beyond what the president himself said the surge would do, whether it would work or not. @!MARGARET-WARNER : Congressman... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying -- I wouldnt vote to tie the hands of our commanders in the field. @!MARGARET-WARNER : Were about to run out of time here, but let me just go back to Congressman Cantor. So, I havent heard from you what your prediction is of how this vote is going to go. Do you think you can peel off enough Democrats to forestall this? @!REP-ERIC-CANTOR : I think the reports are out now that there are 20 Democrats who right now refuse to support their speakers bill. So, obviously, thats -- they need some of our votes to pass it. And they do not have the votes from our side to pass it. So, we will have to see tomorrow what comes. Now, John will do his job. And I think we will continue to do our job, in listening to our members to understand where they are. I do think, though, that the American people are firmly behind our troops, and that they do want to give our troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come home as soon as possible. @!MARGARET-WARNER : All right, Congressman Cantor and Congressman Tanner, thank you both. @!REP-JOHN-TANNER : Thank you. @!REP-ERIC-CANTOR : Thank you. @!JIM-LEHRER : Still coming tonight : Palestinian poets ; and todays Elizabeth Edwards story. Judy Woodruff has that. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF : Democratic presidential hopeful John Edwards and his wife, Elizabeth, delivered their news today in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. @!JOHN-EDWARDS : The biopsy showed that the cancer had returned. It was malignant. And, so, the net result of all the tests is that she has -- her cancer is back. Its largely confined in bone. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF : Elizabeth Edwards was first diagnosed with breast cancer in the final weeks of the 2004 presidential campaign. John Edwards was the vice presidential nominee, sharing the Democratic ticket with Senator John Kerry. Today, the Edwards explained how concern over a broken rib quickly led to the discovery this week of malignant cancer in Elizabeths right rib. @!JOHN-EDWARDS : when the cancer goes from breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its no longer curable. It is completely treatable. The thing that is true is that her cancer will not be cured now. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF : For her part, the 57-year-old Elizabeth Edwards said she and her family were very hopeful. @!ELIZABETH-EDWARDS : And were blessed to have such an extraordinary doctor in whose care I have been and will continue to be. But the other thing you do is keep -- keep a positive attitude that we had actually before. You know, John was saying that, last week, people asked him how I was doing, and he said, shes cancer-free. It turned out not to be the truth. But it was that attitude of, you know, were going to always look for the silver lining. It is who we are as people, and we will continue to do it. I do want to say something. And that is, this is what happens to every cancer survivor, not that you ultimately get a bad diagnosis, but, every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And thats all -- every cancer survivor that you know personally has exactly that experience of knowing that the pain they feel in their side, the ache they feel someplace could be the sign of something worse. This turned out to be. There were times yesterday that we thought it might be a lot worse than it is, and we wouldnt be having the same conference were having right now with the same hopeful tone. We were actually encouraged as we got more and more test results. And, right now, we feel incredibly optimistic. I expect to do next week all the things I did last week, and the week after that, and next year at the same time, all the same things I did last week. I do not expect -- except that I will be seeing Dr. Carey a lot more often -- I do nt expect my life to be significantly different. One of the things -- one of the hopeful signs, besides the fact that this is, as Lisa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much cancer I have in me -- in my bones -- is, Im also completely asymptomatic. And Im actually very lucky that I cracked this rib, because, if I had nt cracked it, I wouldnt have gotten the chest X-ray that identified the suspicious place. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF : Elizabeth Edwards, a lawyer, has played a major role advising her husband in 2003 and 04, as well as in the current campaign. She was asked today if she felt ready to accompany him on another presidential run. @!ELIZABETH-EDWARDS : I absolutely ready for this. Im ready for that. Honestly, I have all the energy. I mean, one of the reasons to do a press conference, as opposed to a press release so that you can see, I mean, I do nt look sickly ; I do nt feel sickly. And, you know, Im as ready as any person can be for that. I mean, you know how grueling it is in general. There is a likelihood that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at some times make me tired. I have, as you all well know -- and a lot of you know -- actually know that my children -- my younger children, a 6- and an 8-year-old. If I get tired, I actually expect theyre going to be the reason, as opposed to the medications that Dr. Carey is going to be giving me. But theres a chance the both of them will make me tired sometimes. And, so, sometimes I will step back to sort of regain my -- my energy. But Im also 57, you know, and so I might get a little tired. But, right now, I do nt feel any of that. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF : Edwards physician, Dr. Lisa Carey, spoke to reporters afterwards. @!DR-LISA-CAREY-Eli : This is a very variable thing. I do nt have a crystal ball about how shes going to do. I can tell you that many patients with exactly the circumstances that she has do very well for a number of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and that there isnt a lot of the cancer, and that she does nt have symptoms, all work in her favor. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF : Dr. Carey added that Edwards cancer may have spread to other sites, including her lungs. For more about treating and dealing with breast cancer, we turn to Dr. Julie Gralow. Shes associate director of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Shes an oncologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine and a spokesperson for the American Society of Clinical Oncology. @!Dr-Gralow-first-o# @!DR-JULIE-GRALOW-A : Stage four breast cancer is when breast cancer comes back outside the general area of the breast and the chest wall. The most common places that stage four breast cancer occurs are the bones, the liver and the lungs. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF : And we heard the Edwards, we heard their doctor say today its treatable, but its not curable. Why not? @!DR-JULIE-GRALOW : Well, I think thats a very accurate way of looking at it. At this point, theres really no reasonable expectation, when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cancer will go away entirely without any therapy, and then never return. But diabetes, for the most part, is incurable. Hypertension, high blood pressure, is incurable. Those are also examples of highly treatable diseases, where you expect to be on therapy for the remainder of your life. You might have to adjust those therapies, but hopefully will have a long life. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF : Help us understand. Two-and-a-half years ago, Mrs. Edwards was diagnosed with breast cancer. She was treated for that. It -- we were told it went into remission. Now she has what is described as cancer in the bone. What happened to cause this? @!DR-JULIE-GRALOW : Its quite clear that, when cancer comes back in the bone or the liver or the lungs, that it was there all along. It did nt regenerate anew. It was there even during all of the prior treatments. Cancer can go through the blood, through the lymphatic system. And bone seems to be a site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theres an interaction between the bone cells and the breast cancer cells that allow it to survive. You cant see it at the time. Its a few cells. It wont show up on scans. Unfortunately, in this case, it appears to have survived all of the prior treatment and the chemotherapy. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF : And, so, to be perfectly accurate, this is breast cancer in the bone, not bone cancer? @!DR-JULIE-GRALOW : Absolutely, two very different diseases, treated very different ways. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF : And, when we understand -- when we hear them say that this is breast cancer, is it in one bone? Is it in bone tissue in more than one place? Or we do nt know the answer to that? @!DR-JULIE-GRALOW : Even if we only see it in one site, we know that, once breast cancer is in the bone, its generally spread much more widely throughout the bone. The bone is highly connected to the blood. The marrow is constantly bathed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nt know this in Mrs. Edwards case -- its only seen in one spot, it is undoubtedly in other spots, which is why, in general, we would be using a systemic therapy, a therapy that floats through the blood, as opposed to a highly local therapy. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF : So -- and, again, on -- on where it is, we also heard that the doctor, Mrs. Edwards doctor -- I believe her name is Dr. Carey -- say today that -- that she ought -- that its possible this cancer is also in the lungs. Now, what difference would it make if it were isolated in the bone, or if it had already spread to the lungs? @!DR-JULIE-GRALOW : Patients whose disease comes back in the bone only or in the bone predominantly tend to have much longer survivals, tend to have slower-growing, less aggressive disease. The lungs, and in particular the liver, are organs where, if the cancer gets out of control, it can lead to a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer in the lungs can be still a reasonable prognosis, we can expect years of survival, if the lungs or the liver become filled with cancer, those organs stop functioning. And that is what leads to death in most of our breast cancer patients who ultimately die of their breast cancer. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF : So -- so, based on what you know right now, Dr. Gralow, what is Mrs. Edwards prognosis? And, again, we know theyre still doing tests about this -- on this cancer. @!DR-JULIE-GRALOW : Well, without knowing the full details, I would have to say theres a lot of reason for her optimism and her hope. Its very appropriate. I think that I -- she gives hope to all of our patients around the country who are fighting metastatic breast cancer. We do nt have a crystal ball, as Dr. Carey said. Averages are just that, averages in terms of survival. Theyre wrong for almost everybody. If the disease is predominantly in the bones, then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realistic. And the treatment options are changing so much. We have got so many terrific new therapies that are available, even since Mrs. Edwards was originally diagnosed, that we can expect more treatments to become available that will hopefully allow all women with metastatic breast cancer, and cancer in general, to live out long lives. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF : And, just quickly, what are those -- the options of treatments? @!DR-JULIE-GRALOW : Its important to individualize the cancer, to know what genes are turned on and off, estrogen receptors important. About three-quarters of breast cancer express estrogen receptor. We have drugs that target that receptor and turn the cell off. @!HER2-is-another-ve# @!JUDY-WOODRUFF : And we did hear the doctor, her doctor, today say that she does expect that there wouldnt be surgery. @!DR-JULIE-GRALOW : Thats right. That would not be performed, given we would expect this disease, even if we cant see it, has spread much farther than one site. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF : And Mrs. Edwards quality of life, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said she expects to have -- her next week to look like last week, to carry on as much as possible. Her husband, obviously, has a busy schedule. She does. Can she carry on? @!DR-JULIE-GRALOW : It depends entirely on the treatment. But there are great treatments available now that -- that do nt cause a lot of symptoms. She right now is feeling relatively asymptomatic, except for pain in that rib. And thats a really good sign. There are therapies where she might have fatigue as the main side effect. And I think we do much better with nausea drugs, if she needs chemotherapy. And we do -- we do better in general with quality of life in metastatic breast cancer. We do nt do well enough, but I also think theres reason for optimism that -- that she can lead a busy, active life. I think her -- her biggest issue is, she has a couple young kids to raise. And, of course, were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids and see her grandchildren. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF : Well, we certainly all -- we, all of us, wish her the very best. @!Dr-Julie-Gralow-t# @!DR-JULIE-GRALOW : Thank you. @!JIM-LEHRER : And finally tonight, the second of Jeffrey Browns reports on the Middle East through the words of poets. Last night, he featured Israeli writers -- tonight, Palestinians. @!SAMIH-AL-QASIM-Po : The populations are mixed, Muslims, Christians, Jews. @!JEFFREY-BROWN : The home of Samih al-Qasim sits high on a hill in the ancient Galilean village of Rama, famous for its abundant olive groves. His family has lived in the village for centuries. Al-Qasim was born in 1939 and was 9 when this region became part of the new state of Israel, following a bloody war. Around the same time, he learned of his calling in life. @!SAMIH-AL-QASIM : In the elementary school one day, the teacher of Arabic came and he said, in a dramatic way : We have a poet in this class. And everybody looked at -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here? And he wrote a few lines on the black board. And I discovered, Im the poet. @!JEFFREY-BROWN : It was a role he would grow to play in a very public way. As a young man living in an Arab village under Israeli military law in the 1950s and 60s, he recited his verses throughout the region, and was jailed several times for his writing. Later, recognized as a leading poet and intellectual, he would get to know many political leaders, Palestinian and Israeli. Words, he says, are his tools. @!SAMIH-AL-QASIM : At the very beginning, it was a matter of surviving, just to stay in your homeland. And then you discover that you deserve more, not only to stay in your homeland, but to live free and equal in your homeland. So, language became an instrument. @!JEFFREY-BROWN : English readers can now read his words in a volume titled " Sadder Than Water. " Here, there are poems that mix anger and sorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life. @!SAMIH-AL-QASIM : I hope I could have more time to write love poems only, because I feel it, and I want it, and I need it. But you cant be concentrated in love poems when your life is threatened. You have, first of all, to defend your life, your existence. @!JEFFREY-BROWN : One of the early poems is called " End of a Talk With a Jailer. " @!SAMIH-AL-QASIM : " From the narrow window of my small cell, I see trees that are smiling at me and rooftops crowded with my family, and windows weeping and praying for me. From the narrow window of my small cell, I can see your big cell, your big cell. " @!JEFFREY-BROWN : The poem is called " End of a Talk With a Jailer. " So, even in this situation, you wanted to communicate. @!SAMIH-AL-QASIM : Yes, of course. I never considered the struggle of my people with the Israeli people as a struggle, a hopeless case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can overcome this struggle. @!JEFFREY-BROWN : Samih al-Qasim is an optimistic man, and, as we learned, a gracious host. But he is also realistic, especially about the dangers of being a writer amid the rising extremism of the Middle East. @!SAMIH-AL-QASIM : Theres a lot of violence. And in the medieval -- even in the medieval times, there was an argument between books. A philosopher wrote a book. Another one faced him with another book. Now the -- the confrontation is between the book and the pistol, the poem and the -- the bomb. So, its not fair. Its not a fair confrontation. @!JEFFREY-BROWN : There were no olive groves on our drive from Jerusalem into the West Bank, only a high concrete barrier, the new reality of this old conflict. For Israelis, this is a security fence, built to keep out suicide bombers. To Palestinians, this is a punitive wall to divide and control, a barrier, a fence, a wall. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a struggle over the language. There are two narratives in this land, and each one has its own terms, and it has its ground rules. @!JEFFREY-BROWN : Ghassan Zaqtan is a poet and journalist who works in the West Bank city of Ramallah, and lives in a new home in a nearby village. From his balcony, he can see a Jewish settlement on a nearby hill, another fact of life in the West Bank. @!GHASSAN-ZAQTAN : But you have to start from the details. @!JEFFREY-BROWN : So, where do the details come from in -- for your poetry? @!GHASSAN-ZAQTAN : Memory. @!JEFFREY-BROWN : Memory? @!GHASSAN-ZAQTAN : Memory is very important. @!JEFFREY-BROWN : As always on our trip, we were offered coffee. Here, it turned out to be a good way into talking about poetry. @!GHASSAN-ZAQTAN : For this uncertain place, for uncertain life, which we have in this area, we have to -- to protect our personal history. @!JEFFREY-BROWN : In Ramallah, where Zaqtan writes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often tense and tenuous life. The Palestinian Authority police patrol the streets. Within the Palestinian community, tensions between Hamas -- which won last years election -- and Fatah, the longtime ruling party, have often resulted in violence. For his part, Ghassan Zaqtan lived abroad for many years, returning after the hopeful days of the Oslo peace accords between Israel and the Palestinians. Now those days seem far away. @!GHASSAN-ZAQTAN( through translator) : A complete people has lost its future, has lost the location, has lost its place. And, obviously, poetry is one of the most expressive forms in order to reach the people. This is why the poets were the first to remind these people of their identity. This is yours. @!JEFFREY-BROWN : Zaqtan does this by writing about the small details of life. @!GHASSAN-ZAQTAN( through translator) : I am not the kind of person who will walk in front of the demonstration. I feel thats not my place. I walk behind the demonstration in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether its the handkerchief or a childs backpack or a purse. Thats my attitude. @!JEFFREY-BROWN : Only a few of Ghassan Zaqtans poems have been translated into English. One, called " The Habit of Exiles, " ends this way. @!GHASSAN-ZAQTAN( through translator) : " My heart is suspicious, brother. My stance is final. No one will guess the storms in my head. I no longer have confidence in those who pass through at night. " @!JEFFREY-BROWN : " No one will guess at the storms in my head. " Are their there storms? What are they? @!GHASSAN-ZAQTAN( through translator) : Of course there are, but the storms in my head are questions, questions concerning everything. I believe that part of my role, as a poet, is to generate questions, to create a place for them. It is not our job to provide answers, but to be an incubator that produces questions. @!JEFFREY-BROWN : Amid the inescapable politics, perhaps the most personal poetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ali, a self-described **25;312;TOOLONG. For decades, Muhammad Ali has run a small souvenir shops just steps from the Basilica of the Annunciation in Nazareth, selling religious trinkets and other items to the pilgrims, who come to this town by the busload. Nazareth, where the church bells compete with the calls to prayer from the mosques, is a predominantly Arab city of Muslims and Christians within Israel. Taha Muhammad Ali came here as a boy, after his familys home in a nearby village was destroyed in the 1948 war. With just a fourth-grade education, he is a self-taught man, a voracious reader who quotes Steinbeck and Shakespeare, as well as classical Arabic poetry. He decided to be a writer as a boy, and worked daily to make it happen. @!TAHA-MUHAMMAD-ALI : I thought that, if I want to express myself, I have to know what is poetry and what is good poetry. And this went together, reading and trying to write. @!JEFFREY-BROWN : In one short poem translated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So, poetry hides. How do you find it? @!TAHA-MUHAMMAD-ALI : You have to take the pen and to take a paper, and to be ready to wait for him. Otherwise, he will come and you are not there. As a writer, you have to train yourself to write. Write anything, but every day. @!JEFFREY-BROWN : Muhammad Alis work has been translated and made available to an English-speaking audience by Peter Cole, an American poet and publisher whos lived in Jerusalem for 20 years. Coles wife, Adina Hoffman, is now writing a biography of the poet. A new selection of poetry, " So What, " was published last year. While Ghassan Zaqtan spoke to us about two competing narratives in the Mideast, one Palestinian and the other Israeli, Muhammad Ali breaks down the world of words in a different way. @!TAHA-MUHAMMAD-ALI : I think there is two kinds of language, one for the news, for the politicians, and this is broad, and one for poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are different, very different languages. @!JEFFREY-BROWN : Muhammad Ali insists that his poetry does speak to the conflict around him, but indirectly. @!TAHA-MUHAMMAD-ALI : In my poetry, there is no Palestine, no Israel, But, in my poetry, suffering, sadness, longing, fear, and this is, together, make the results : Palestine and Israel. The art is to take from life something real, then to build it anew with your imagination. @!JEFFREY-BROWN : He illustrated how this works with a short passage from his poem " Twigs. " @!TAHA-MUHAMMAD-ALI( through translator) : " And, so, it has taken me all of 60 years to understand that water is the finest drink and bread the most delicious food, and that art is worthless unless it plants a measure of splendor in peoples hearts. " @!JEFFREY-BROWN : Poets have no tanks or guns, Taha Muhammad Ali told us ; they have only beautiful words. No one we met believed that beautiful words alone would change the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language from becoming insane. " It is my salvation, " he says, " and I think it is the salvation of many other people. " @!JIM-LEHRER : And, again, more on this project is available on our Web site at PBS.org, including profiles and recordings of the featured poets, background materials on poetry in the Middle East, and an online forum with two of the poets. And, again, the major developments of this day : The U.S. House began debating a war funding bill. Democrats included a mandate that combat troops leave Iraq by September of next year. The Senate Judiciary Committee authorized subpoenas in the firing of U.S. attorneys. And British police arrested three men in the 2005 London transit bombings. And once more to our honor roll of American service personnel killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. We add them as their deaths are made official and photographs become available. Here, in silence, are 11 more. We will see you online and again here tomorrow evening with Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lehrer. Thank you, and good night.
