234241 @!ANNOUNCER : From ABC News, This Week with David Brinkley. Now, from our Washington headquarters, here 's David Brinkley. DAVID BRINKLEY, ABC News : What do we have now? We have a Republican President who is trying to hold off one challenger who says he is more aggressively Republican and another challenger who is a Democrat but talks like a Republican. The two challengers are, of course, Pat Buchanan, and Paul Tsongas, our guests today. In addition, the voters can choose from a sort of political supermarket with shelves stocked with candidates ranging from a 1930's-style New Dealer on through conventional candidates with an assortment of ideas on how to spend money and others so obscure you never heard of them. One of them will win the great privilege of spending the next four years fighting with Congress. voice-over Out of all that, what are our prospects? We will ask our guests : Pat Buchanan, Republican, in St. Petersburg, Florida ; and Paul Tsongas, Democrat, in Portland, Maine. Some background from our man, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts, here on our Sunday program. on camera First, a little news since the Sunday morning papers. In Moscow, some thousands of Communists who are still hard-liners held an illegal rally near the Kremlin, fighting with the police. ABC 'S David Ensor in Moscow. DAVID ENSOR, ABC News : voice-over An angry crowd - several thousand pro-Communist demonstrators - was stopped by police lines and vehicles from reaching Red Square. The police had orders to use force. The protesters did not have a permit and the Russian government of President Boris Yeltsin clearly wanted to put opponents on notice it will not tolerate illegal demonstrations. A mile away, near Red Square, top military officials laid wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, as they always do on this day, known until this year as Army Day. This year, it is the Day of Defenders of the Homeland and Yeltsin said while the Soviet Union is no more, there are still men in uniform worthy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protesters who want the Soviet Union back as it was, are trying to convince the army to support them. David Ensor, ABC News, Moscow. Mr. BRINKLEY : And another Presidential caucus today- in Maine. Twenty-three delegates will be chosen. Rivals of Paul Tsongas say he will win, but he says he wo n't. We 'll be back with all the rest of today 's program in a moment. Commercial break Mr. BRINKLEY : President Bush is in the unusual position of being attacked from the opposition party, where he expected it, and being attacked from his own party, where he did not expect it. It 'll take another two or three or so primaries to see how serious this is, how much of a threat to reelection of George Bush, but in the meantime, it has indeed captured his attention. Some background on how we go to this point from Jack Smith. Jack? JACK SMITH, ABC News : voice-over David, Pat Buchanan this week emerged as a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 16-point margin of victory in New Hampshire was smaller than he wanted. Pres. GEORGE BUSH : I 'm not saying that I would n't have liked to do better, but I 'm satisfied with the results and now we 're down here and we 're going to take this guy on in every single state @!SMITH voice-over As he headed south, there were strong hints the President would take off the gloves, but he never did and, in speeches, would n't even mention Buchanan by name. Pres. BUSH : Some people wish the rest of the world would just go away. That is naive and that is defeatist @!SMITH voice-over The President, of course, wants to continue looking presidential, but he also fears dividing his party. Pat Buchanan has no such qualms. PATRICK BUCHANAN,( R), Presidential Candidate : Mr. Bush promised he would veto a quota bill @!SMITH voice-over The conservative Buchanan has been attacking the President for signing last year 's Civil Rights Bill, in fact, for every piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governing. The Vice President pleaded with conservatives this week not to let Buchanan split the GOP. Vice President J DANFORTH QUAYLE : It would be irresponsible to endanger all that we have achieved since Ronald Reagan and George Bush were elected in 1980 @!SMITH voice-over But Buchanan is playing well with conservatives because they 're mad at the President. 1st VOTER : He lies to you. He recants. He changes his stance on everything. I 'm sick of being lied to. Mr. BUCHANAN : I think we 're doing well. I think we 're going to surprise folks down here @!SMITH voice-over Buchanan, as he heads south now, believes he can keep his insurgency alive- bad news for a President who 's under attack from the Democrats as well. KEVIN PHILLIPS, Political Analyst : And that 's really been the threat, when a president is simultaneously hurt by insurgency within his own party. It reinforces the general sense of the public that this guy is not doing things very well @!SMITH Only four incumbent presidents since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of the vote in New Hampshire. Two subsequently dropped out - Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson - and two lost the general election- Jerry Ford and Jimmy Carter. None of the four went on to win. voice-over Front-runner Paul Tsongas hopes to win today 's caucuses in Maine, but to keep going, he has to win elsewhere and so, the day after New Hampshire, he was in Maryland, whose primary in a week offers the first real test of his electability outside his native New England. PAUL TSONGAS,( D), Presidential Candidate : It 's no accident that this is where I came first. Maryland is critical @!SMITH voice-over Critical to test the appeal of his pro-business economic realism and his opposition to the middle-class tax cuts favored by his rivals. Mr. TSONGAS : And where 's the money going to come from with a $400-billion deficit? They 're going to borrow the money from my kids! That 's pandering. 2nd VOTER : I like his ideas about business, capital gains. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do well in Maryland, but as the campaign moves south - with primaries in Georgia in a week 's time, then South Carolina and in two weeks, Super Tuesday - Tsongas may not do as well with voters in the South. 3rd VOTER : Paul Tsongas- that 's a name that 's pretty much in the closet- I have n't really heard a lot about @!INTERVIEWER Do you know who Paul Tsongas is? 4th VOTER : No @!SMITH voice-over Tsongas is looking for help in the South. From former President Jimmy Carter, among others, he got kind words, but no endorsement. For the South, this is rival Bill Clinton 's territory. Gov. BILL CLINTON,( D), Presidential Candidate : It 's wonderful to be back in a place where I am the only candidate without an accent @!SMITH voice-over The South is Clinton 's base. He 's well-organized there and has the endorsements. Questions about his character might hurt him in the more traditional South, but most expect him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Clinton 's able to sweep Georgia with half or more of the vote and then win big in South Carolina, he is very well-positioned to sweep the southern states on Super Tuesday and come out of those primaries way ahead in delegates of any other candidate. Sen. BOB KERREY,( D), Presidential Candidate : On next Tuesday, I need a lift @!SMITH voice-over All the Democrats are running in this Tuesday 's South Dakota primary, but for Bob Kerrey from neighboring Nebraska and Iowa 's Tom Harkin, victory is essential. The loser may drop out. Jerry Brown 's low-budget campaign, on the other hand, will probably go on to the Democratic Convention in July no matter what happens. on camera This first real week of the 1992 primary season has been good to two of the field 's main outsiders - Pat Buchanan and Paul Tsongas - but that is not surprising, given the persistent, recession, the voters ' angry mood and their desire to send Washington a message. David? Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Tsongas, former senator from Massachusetts, now a candidate for President and the Democrats are uneasy with him, saying he sounds like a Republican ; and shortly, Pat Buchanan, former White House speech writer, journalist, television talker, who thinks President Bush is not Republican enough, in a moment. Commercial break Mr. BRINKLEY : Sen. Tsongas, thank you for coming. PAUL TSONGAS, Presidential Candidate : Good morning. Mr. BRINKLEY : We 're very pleased to have you with us today. Mr. TSONGAS : Thank you. Mr. BRINKLEY : Here in the studio are George Will and Sam Donaldson, both of ABC News. Mr. TSONGAS : Good morning. Mr. BRINKLEY : Now, Senator, first a moderately silly question. What do you say to those- Mr. TSONGAS : Is that going to be the only one? Mr. BRINKLEY : No- no, I hope not. What do you say to those who say you sound like a Republican? What do you say to them? Mr. TSONGAS : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I 'm pro-business. I may be very liberal on social issues - I 'm the strongest person, for example, on choice or gay rights or the environment - but when it comes to economics, call me what you wish. I 'm aggressively pro-growth. In fact, in the New Hampshire primary, not only did I win the Democratic nomination, but I also came in third in the Republican primary and I think the fact that a Democrat can appeal to Republicans and Independents should not be something that drives the party establishment into this kind of terror. GEORGE WILL, ABC News : Mr. Tsongas, the Democrats in Congress took their best shot and they said, " Our issue is tax fairness and here it is. " And they came up with a bill that gives a middle-class tax cut of about a dollar a day to the normal family and they cut and then took back the cut in the corporate income tax and they indexed capital gains and all that. You say you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how can you expect to be nominated by a party which, given its best shot on its primary issue of tax fairness, you say they 're not only wrong, but you 'd veto it? Mr. TSONGAS : Well, the fast is that- you know, I went to the same meetings everybody else did and saw the same poll results in which the appeal to be to the middle class. But the fact is that is a political argument. The middle class tax cut is the answer to the question, " Where are the votes? " It 's not the answer to the question, " How do you revive the economy? " So I want to simply provide the American people an alternative. If they want Santa Claus, I 'm not the candidate. And yesterday, down in Plains, President Carter spoke to the issue of the middle class tax cut and was very harsh in his language about it, so I guess I 'd rather stake my claim with him than what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen you quoted as saying, " The issue of fairness is fine, but I only have so many bullets to fire at the moment. I want to get the economy started. I 'll get to the subject of fairness later. " Mr. TSONGAS : That 's right. Mr. WILL : Tell us what- when you get to it later, what is on your agenda to make the tax system more fair? What 's unfair about it now? Mr. TSONGAS : Well, I think you have to go back- I think the argument about fairness and the middle class has merit and some of the proposals that you see, I think, in terms of outlines, are not illegitimate. But the problem is, as we stated in the beginning, the first job is to give the middle class work. That is the ultimate obligation. And then, when the economy is running, we deal with the deficit, we 're a competitive nation and we 're in the position where we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and lower the taxes of the middle class and raise the taxes on the wealthy so you bring some kind of balance, but this is not the time to do that. We have a $400-billion deficit. The people in Washington who are so upset at me, they 're sitting there while this is happening. And I will tell you that my election will be a mandate. It 's not just Paul Tsongas as a person, but it 's a mandate for economic truth. And I think the people in Washington - and you know, I served there for 10 years, a lot of them are my friends - they 'll understand this is a mandate and they will respond to that. Mr. WILL : You mentioned former President Carter a moment. The Washington Post this morning has a headline that says, " Carter cites similarities between himself and Tsongas. " With some people, that 's not a net plus. What do you think of the Carter presidency and would you like to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I think on issues, for example, of an energy policy, he was very aggressive. I think on issues like human rights- you know, when I give my speeches, I make it very clear that my presidency is going to have human rights as a cornerstone of its foreign policy. And secondly, President Carter had convictions. He was not someone who was all over the lot, someone who would take one position today and another position tomorrow. And it was interesting yesterday in our discussion that we have the same joint hero. To me, Anwar Sadat was the most impressive person I ever ran into in my political life and President Carter feels the same way. So I think leaders who have conviction offer something that, over the long term, I think people can feel very good about. SAM DONALDSON, ABC News : Senator, now that you 're being taken extremely seriously, as you and everyone else has said, your health has become a major issue. Mr. TSONGAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've been free of it, what, a little over five years? Mr. TSONGAS : Yeah, five and a half years. Mr. DONALDSON : So do you fit the definition? Do you say you 're cured? Mr. TSONGAS : Well, I say I 'm cured, but the fact is that what I went through was very experimental and I was indeed a guinea pig. But I think The New York Times editorial today put it in some perspective. Now, I have a political problem. I mean, my doctor gives all kinds of medical reports, et cetera, but that does not solve the political issue and that 's why we decided that I would enter the Nationals in swimming in May and demonstrate just - through the butterfly and the other events - that physically I 'm doing fine. But I know that 's coming and I know that some of my opponents have been talking to people and trying to spread stories about my health. They 're not true, but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming competitively is the only way we can think about - to give people that assurance. Mr. DONALDSON : Senator, if I may, the fact that at the moment you have great physical strength does not really speak to the issue of whether tomorrow, God forbid, or next month or next year, you should have a recurrence of a disease which would quickly sap your physical strength. Mr. TSONGAS : Well, Sam- Mr. DONALDSON : Can you give any sort of assurance - and I guess the answer is no - that that would n't happen? And second, does that differentiate you from other men your age or are you in the same kind of risk pool at the moment that you would be as if you had never had cancer in the first place? Mr. TSONGAS : Well, Sam, let me say that I can not guarantee that I will never get cancer, but I can not guarantee that about you, either, number one. Secondly, as the Times editorial pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than that of President Bush. And the third point - I think the most important - for people who are concerned about the fact that I 've had cancer in the past, I would ask them to think about dimension and that is yes, I 've had to face the prospect of my own death - I 've had to think about my kids not knowing me - and going through that process, as difficult at it was, I think has given me a perspective. And when I talk about generations and generation responsibility, that 's just not rhetoric. That 's not something given to me by my staff. That 's how I think. And so, when things like the middle- class tax cut or Japan 's bashing, these other things come up, I 've been able to say no because my perspective is different, so it 's a good news/bad news situation and we 'll see how the voters feel about it. Mr. DONALDSON : Senator, let me just press the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Okay. Mr. DONALDSON : As you know, when President Bush has had problems over his presidency, the stock market drops and people go, " What? President Quayle? " And that may be unfair, but is there any way, if you were the nominee of the Democratic Party, that you would move, in your selection of a running mate - other than to say that he or she is the best-qualified person after you to be President - that you would try to reassure the country on the point that we 've been discussing? Mr. TSONGAS : I have to. You know, when I began this a year ago, when it was so improbable, I sat down and wrote on a piece of paper the names of people that I thought would be qualified and I 've continued that discussion with people for this last year. I would meet people and say, " Give me three names. Give me three names of the best people you can think about, " because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issues that you raised, but what happened in ' 88 - that the person who is my nominee for Vice President be so superbly qualified that people will feel comfortable. And Sam, I hate to say it, but you 're not on that list yet. Mr. WILL : Mr. Tsongas, when you 're criticized by liberals for having what they call heretical views on tax and other matters, you respond by saying on social issues you 're quite liberal. Let me ask you about two questions vexing and troubling some communities. First of all, some school districts around the country are distributing - in many cases without any parental involvement or consent - are distributing condoms to teenagers. Are you in favor of that? Mr. TSONGAS : Yes. I think AIDS is a real issue. You know, I know what it means to have a disease and I think the spread of AIDS is something we simply have to confront and do it seriously. It 's not been a matter of real discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a difficult issue, it 's very troubling and the issue of abstinence, those kinds of things, I think are real issues. But the fact is that we have to protect these kids by giving them information. Mr. WILL : Gay rights groups have been important in the Democratic Party, particularly in some states, and part of their agenda in some states is spousal rights for gay couples- employee benefits in the public and private sector. Are you in favor of spousal rights for gay couples? Mr. TSONGAS : Well, I would be willing to look at that. We have not taken a position simply because we have not figured out what the economics are, but I sponsored the Gay Rights Bill. My whole view is that we are one team, that whether you 're black or brown or white or male or female, whatever, that everybody in this country counts. And this whole question of healing the country, making everybody feel like they 're part of it. So in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's part of this team, I 'm aggressively in favor of that. So the Democrats who are so anathema to my economic problems I think really should look at my positions on those kinds of issues. For example, the issue of choice, a woman 's right to choose. There is no candidate in the Democratic primary who does not have to explain away some prior position or some statement that they made. My position on choice has been consistent way back in the early 70 's and I would hope that people will look at that and not simply reject me in the Democratic Party because I have economic views that are pro-growth. Mr. DONALDSON : Senator, let me ask you about your position on the capital punishment issue because it seems to be two positions. One, you say you 're for the death penalty for crimes against society, like drug pushers or dealers, but you 're not for the death penalty for crimes against individuals, like a serial killer. Now, how do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was back in 1990, when I was urged to run for governor, I sat down and thought about the issue in great detail - because the issue of drugs was overwhelming America - and tried to figure out how, in terms of cutting off the supply, you dealt with it. It turns out I never ran for governor for family reasons, et cetera, but what I did was I sat down and wrote a memo to those candidates who were running and articulated my view, after a lot of thought, as to what their position should be. So this is not something that I manufactured for this campaign. Mr. DONALDSON : Well, I 'm not suggesting- go ahead. Mr. TSONGAS : Basically, my feeling is that the capital punishment, the death penalty is society 's strongest sanction and should not be spread around, as George Bush has suggested, for every crime imaginable ' cause it loses its impact, it loses its sanction. So what I tried to do was to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the society. And those who engage in drug-trafficking at the major level, number one ; secondly, those crimes against an individual who represents society, so you 'd be talking about a police officer, a judge, that kind of thing. My concern is if you make capital punishment available for 50, 60, 70 crimes, eventually( a) you execute someone who 's innocent and( b) the sanction loses its meaning. Mr. DONALDSON : But, Senator, if you make capital punishment something that you use, you would execute someone who is innocent who 's a drug pusher just as easily, would you not? Mr. TSONGAS : Well, at some point, you cross the threshold, that the threat to society is so strong that you simply have to take that risk. And this is a position I sat down and thought about endlessly and it 's my view that the critical death penalty sanction should be used only for those things which are so serious to society that you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRINKLEY : Senator Tsongas, thank you very much. Mr. TSONGAS : Thank you, David. Mr. BRINKLEY : Thank you for coming. Pleasure to have you with us. Good luck to you. Mr. TSONGAS : Thank you. Mr. BRINKLEY : Coming next, Pat Buchanan, who did far better in the New Hampshire primary, running again President Bush, than the President expected or hoped, in a moment. Commercial break Mr. BRINKLEY : Mr. Buchanan, in St. Petersburg- PATRICK BUCHANAN,( R), Presidential Candidate : David, how are you? Mr. BRINKLEY : Fine. How are you this morning? Mr. BUCHANAN : Pretty good. Mr. BRINKLEY : Delighted to have you with us. Mr. BUCHANAN : Thanks for having me. Mr. BRINKLEY : We have the usual crowd here- you know them all. Mr. BUCHANAN : Right, right. Mr. BRINKLEY : Now, tell us this. We 've all been to New Hampshire and back and we have all observed that the two candidates who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you, the Republican and Senator Tsongas, the somewhat conservative Democrat. What are we to make of that? Is the country moving rightward? Mr. BUCHANAN : Well, in a sense, David, that is correct. Mr. Bush is perceived as having walked away from the conservatives of New Hampshire and the conservative Republicans. But take a look at the Buchanan votes. I beat George Bush among union members 2-1. I beat among veterans. I beat him among folks making $10,000 to $30,000 a year. So this is not only a conservative challenge to George Bush, we want a middle American revolution, which includes Democrats, Independents and Republicans, to overthrow the establishments of the both parties in Washington. Mr. BRINKLEY : What? Overthrow the establishments of both parties in- what would be left? Mr. BUCHANAN : Well, here 's what you do. You would change George Bush and the incumbent Republican establishment and then turn over the " long parliament, " if you will, a House of Representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in people at all levels of government, I think, David, because government in Washington is totally out of touch with the American people. We have one-party government that conspires together to impose quotas people do n't want, to raise taxes that people do n't want, to raise congressional pay when the American people, by 90 percent, said, " We do n't want it. " They 're out of touch down there. Mr. BRINKLEY : Well, just as one relatively small point- not really small. Mr. BUCHANAN : Right. Mr. BRINKLEY : How do you change the U.S. Congress where 98 percent of the members are routinely reelected every two years? How do you do that? Mr. BUCHANAN : If I can- all right, David, here 's how I would try. If I can be nominated, I will turn the Republican Party into a middle American party, working and middle class. I will make the whole campaign a challenge to the Congress of the United States to overturn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then, if Congress- there will be more changes made. If Congress does not change then, then you hit Congress with issue are issue in which I believe and confront them. And then, you would ask the country, in 1994, " Choose them or choose us. " The problem that George Bush has got is he has cooperated and compromised and caved in and he ca n't do battle with the institution now because he 's not credible. Mr. WILL : Mr. Buchanan, you already seem to be changing the government a bit. Shortly - and I mean very shortly - after you criticized the National Endowment for the Arts, the head thereof is disappearing. Mr. BUCHANAN : Right. Mr. WILL : Now, the Administration says it has n't got a thing to do with anything you said. I 'd like to know whether you think it had something to do with that.( B), will you be satisfied if Darman and Brady are next? And the generic question is, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here, when you get a little pile of bones, will you go away? I mean, is there enough the President can do to satisfy you that he 's come back to his conservative senses, as you define them? Mr. BUCHANAN : No, David. I think Frohnmayer was thrown off the sleigh as a sacrifice to the wolves pursuing Mr. President, but the problem there is the individual who 's been raising the budget for the National Endowment for the Arts despite this filthy and blasphemous art and that 's been approved by the White House. With regard to Brady and Darman, who I 've described as the Derek Humphrey and Dr. Kevorkian of the American economy, those two gentlemen- I 'm not going to call for their resignation, George, for this reason. I used to be a White House aide and folks used to regularly call for my resignation. The man that you 've got to address is the man that took the advice, not the folks who gave it. Mr. WILL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid of Darman and Brady and if, say, he reinstated the $500 deduction for children- if he did all of these things, would that convince you that the President was conservative or merely pliable, weak and not to be trusted? Mr. BUCHANAN : Thou has said it- the second part of that, David- I mean, excuse me, George. Exactly. Look, I mean, throwing Frohnmayer out, you know, after I brought his name up or brought up the NEA and then dumping Darman and Brady merely suggests that Mr. Bush would be accommodating himself to the forces, whether polls or primary victories or defeats or whatever. You need a president in there who has convictions, first and foremost, and the courage to fight for them consistently for four years and does n't wait till March 20th of his fourth year in office to announce a great battle with the Congress. Mr. DONALDSON : Mr. Buchanan, you talked about the people who voted for you in New Hampshire. Mr. BUCHANAN : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exit polls showed that half of the people who voted for you said they were n't voting for you, they were voting against George Bush and you were the vehicle through which they would send a message. Does that really say a lot plus about your candidacy? Mr. BUCHANAN : It does, in this sense, Sam. When I first went up there 10 weeks ago, it was probably 100 percent a protest vote against Bush. But in the final two weeks, we threw out all our, what you might call, comparative ads on George Bush and we went positive with what Pat Buchanan would do. And the final week of that campaign, we were getting rallies of more than 1,000 people in Nashua and Manchester. We went all over the state. People were cheering. They were very pro-Buchanan at the end of that campaign- at least half of our voters. By now, Sam, I think we have tripled or quadrupled my support for president among Republicans nationwide. So there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave you the entree, but we are bringing converts over to Buchanan. Mr. DONALDSON : All right, let 's talk about what it means to be pro-Buchanan. Mr. BUCHANAN : All right. Mr. DONALDSON : Let me ask you something you said and I 'd like you to amplify on it. Mr. BUCHANAN : All right. Mr. DONALDSON : You said, " Why are we more shocked when a dozen people are killed in Vilnius than a massacre in Burundi? Because they are white people, " you said. " That 's what we are. That 's where America comes from. " Is n't that a very narrow, pinched view of what this country stands for? Mr. BUCHANAN : No- you know as well as I do, Sam, that that massacre in Vilnius in January, I believe, of 1991, was tremendous headlines, when the Soviet black berets killed those 13 people. That 's enormous headlines. We 've seen massacres in Burundi, for example, of hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that get no coverage whatever. We tend to cover people like us in journalism and to concern ourselves with the fate of people like us. Mr. DONALDSON : Well, you did n't talk about coverage. Mr. BUCHANAN : That 's a simple statement- Mr. DONALDSON : You talked about, " Why are we more shocked? " Are you telling us now that you personally were not more shocked? Mr. BUCHANAN : You mean- what happened in Burundi was horrific, but it was not talked about or discussed by journalists or politicians- Mr. DONALDSON : What do you think, Mr. Buchanan? What do you think? Mr. BUCHANAN : I think- I don't- in the eyes of God- Mr. DONALDSON : Which was more awful for you? Mr. BUCHANAN : In the eyes of God, I think all men have equal worth, so I do n't know exactly that He thought of that, but I do know, in terms of coverage- Mr. DONALDSON : But you said it, not God. Mr. BUCHANAN : Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens in Europe and the West because we are a western people and that is a simple statement of fact. The 60 million who were slaughtered in China went almost unmentioned in the news of this country and the debates of this country, whereas what happened in Hungary almost caused the United States to go to war. We are people of the West. Mr. DONALDSON : But not all of us. Not all of us are a western people now. Mr. BUCHANAN : Well, that is- I mean, look, we are much more concerned about what happens in Europe than we are what happens in central China, Sam. It is a statement of fact. Mr. WILL : Mr. Buchanan- Mr. BUCHANAN : Sure. Mr. WILL : -in his column this morning, Bill Buckley recounts the story of meeting with you- I guess you were in China at the time with President Nixon. Mr. BUCHANAN : That 's right. Mr. WILL : And he said this was after John Ashbrook had begun his challenge in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said, " All right, make your point in New Hampshire, but after that, you run the risk of hurting an incumbent Republican, letting the Democrats in, which is worse than any conceivable Republican. " Now, do you still feel that way? Do you believe- would n't it be fair for someone to come to you and say, " All right, Buchanan, you made your point- pipe down or you 'll help the Democrats "? Mr. BUCHANAN : But my point is this. I was a Nixon aide then, George, and John Ashbrook got nine percent, not 37 percent, as I did. Secondly, this is not a campaign simply to make a point to Mr. Bush. I want to recapture the Republican Party and turn it into a middle American revolutionary instrument, as I said, to try to change the entire establishment of both parties, so I 'm going to fight this through. Go ahead. Mr. WILL : Is it worth risking four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your view, in order to do this? That is, clearly, you are not- at this point, you ca n't conceivable say you 're helping the President, so unless you 're reasonably sure you have a good chance to get the nomination and go on and win, are you not in danger of simply delivering to the Republican convention as weakened President? Mr. BUCHANAN : Right now, George, I believe we 've punched a hole in this blimp. If we punch a second hole in it in Georgia, the whole thing may go up and I will have a fighting chance for the nomination. Mr. WILL : Okay, let 's talk about that. Mr. BUCHANAN : Your question is valid, though, down the road. If you get down the road to the point where you 're not getting 40 percent or 30 percent, but only 15 percent, do you then continue to do battle against the President, who 's the presumptive nominee? You got to take a look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're on a roll. Mr. WILL : Ronald Reagan, whose flag you purport to be carrying, did very well against Ford in Georgia in ' 76 and Bush in Georgia in 1980. This sounds, from the way you 're describing it and on the record, as a place where, if you 're going to have a breakthrough anywhere, you should get it in Georgia. Tell us what you 're going to do in Georgia. Mr. BUCHANAN : I do n't know the numbers, but I do know our numbers- our own surveys have really moved up since New Hampshire. This was the whole idea. The fire would start there. It would catch tinder down here. I do n't know how well we have to do, George, but I 've got to get up to Georgia soon. We 're allocating more and more days there. There is an argument that it may be the New Hampshire of the South. We 're going to put our resources there. I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Mr. Buchanan, in 1986, when President Reagan 's trip to Bitburg, the cemetery in Germany, had been announced and you were Communications Director at the White House, a group of Jewish Americans, led by Eli Wiesel, came to the White House to protest and ask Mr. Reagan not to go. But I 'm told that, in a closed-door meeting with them, you said to them, " When are you people going to start acting like Americans first? " Did you say that and if so, what did you mean by it? Mr. BUCHANAN : Of course, I did n't say it and Eli Wiesel was n't even in the meeting. Mr. DONALDSON : Well, I was told by someone in the meeting that you said that. Mr. BUCHANAN : Who told you, Sam? Where do you get these sources, Sam? Mr. DONALDSON : Well, I have a source for this, Mr. Buchanan. Mr. BUCHANAN : All right, who is he? Mr. DONALDSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well I 'm not going to reveal my source unless he chooses to reveal himself- Mr. BUCHANAN : Listen, if I had done that, Sam- Mr. DONALDSON : -but he was there. Mr. BUCHANAN : Hold it. Sam, that meeting was held three weeks before the Bitburg summit was held. If I had said that, it would have been out of there within hours and on the news. That has not been quoted ever. Where do you get this stuff, Sam? Mr. DONALDSON : Well, I get it, Mr. Buchanan. Mr. BUCHANAN : I 'll bet you do. Mr. DONALDSON : And you don't- Mr. BUCHANAN : Sam, you got to stop collecting this garbage. You got to verify something before you go on national television and use it. Mr. DONALDSON : Well, I verified that. If you say you did n't say it, we 'll accept it. If my source wishes to come forward, then we 'll listen to what he has to say. Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then and make the statement in public because it would have been very dramatic. As for Bitburg, Pat Buchanan did n't advance it, I did n't go there, I did n't speak there. Ronald Reagan did and if you think Bitburg was wrong, take it up with the former President of the United States, whom I 've supported and who I think did a magnificent job at Bergen-Belsen and Bitburg. Mr. DONALDSON : And you think going to Bitburg was correct? Mr. BUCHANAN : I think Mr. Reagan made the decision himself and as an aide, I backed him to the hilt. And I called Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon on the phone and I said, " Should we go? " And they told me personally, " Pat, the President ca n't back down now because this is an issue of whether Reagan 's going to stand tough against pressure. " And I supported Ronald Reagan right to the hilt- correct, Sam. Mr. BRINKLEY : Mr. Buchanan, I think on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much. Mr. BUCHANAN : Thank you very much. Always a pleasure. Mr. BRINKLEY : Thank you very much- thank you for coming today. We 're pleased to have you. Mr. BUCHANAN : Thank you. Mr. BRINKLEY : Coming next, our decision here - freewheeling, ad-lib and not always very well structured, but we 'll see - and joining us will be Cokie Roberts of ABC News, in a moment. Commercial break Mr. BRINKLEY : Well, it is a political year and before go on to other topics, as we will, I would like to ask each of you- what have we learned from the last couple of weeks, New Hampshire and so on? George? Mr. WILL : Well, the country 's in a very sober mood and they 're ready to listen to people who are not telegenic and who display conviction. The real source of the strength of both Buchanan and- Mr. BRINKLEY : That 's Tsongas? Mr. WILL : -Tsongas and Buchanan- is that these people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting around places like this, Tsongas has not, but both have the unifying characteristic of conviction. They 're going against the stream and people seem to like that. Mr. DONALDSON : I do n't know what we 've learned from the standpoint of the long run. In the next 16 days, we may find out when a majority of important primaries are held. But I love the cartoon that 's in the papers this weekend, which shows Tsongas and Bush standing over on the side, holding a First Place medal - they 're all by themselves - while the news media 's concentrating on Clinton and Buchanan, who came in second, as if they were the winners. Let 's face it, folks. The old axiom, those people who get the most votes are the winners and Bush won by 16 percent. That ai n't chopped liver. And for people to suggest that Pat Buchanan won that primary a la Gene McCarthy, they just do n't understand it. COKIE ROBERTS, ABC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still a lot of votes- Mr. DONALDSON : It is. Ms. ROBERTS : -and- Mr. WILL : And Gene McCarthy lost. Ms. ROBERTS : -and Gene McCarthy lost, but pushed the President out. And the historic precedence of presidents who have that kind of showing against them in New Hampshire do n't bode well for President Bush. Mr. BRINKLEY : Well, they lose, that 's why. Ms. ROBERTS : That 's what happens or they withdraw. But New Hampshire 's a very conservative state - conservatives did well in both political parties there - but I think what we really draw from it is that George Bush has got some real trouble going into 1992. People might vote for him, but they 're not liking voting for him. Mr. DONALDSON : He 's got some real trouble, but in my view, he does n't really have an opponent who is going to be nominated by the Republican convention, so you ca n't beat someone with no one, so his problem- Ms. ROBERTS : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 'll be nominated by the Democratic convention. Mr. DONALDSON : Well, the Democratic- if you say to me, " Is Tsongas going to be nominated, " I think maybe he will. Is he going to be elected in the fall? Since I think we 're coming out of the recession, I think maybe he wo n't. Mr. WILL : Two things- the Berlin Wall is now a million souvenirs and the Minnesota Twins have won the World Series and I no longer say anything 's impossible- Ms. ROBERTS : Right. Mr. WILL : -so I 'm not going to write Buchanan or Tsongas or anyone else out of this picture till the voters have done so. What the President has done, so far, is he has lost a minority of Republican support, but that minority happens to be the vast majority of the most intense, passionate and committed Republicans. The base of every Republican president is the conservatives and they 're gone and they 're not coming back. Ms. ROBERTS : You ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but who are they going to vote for, George? Ms. ROBERTS : Well, they do n't have to vote. They can stay home or they can not go fund-raising. They can not go door-to-door. They can not do all those volunteer activities that help in presidential elections and they get the fervor going and all of those things. You ca n't lose your base and then go on and win. You 've got to keep your base. Mr. DONALDSON : That can happen for the fall election, but let 's take it one step at a time. When it comes to the nomination, who are the conservatives going to vote for? They may vote for Pat Buchanan, but not enough of them. Ms. ROBERTS : All right, they might, but they could stay home. But you see, the Democrats are the same danger of losing a base. If you nominate someone like Paul Tsongas, who is very conservative, as he just said, in his economic positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the base of the union vote that is a Democratic essential to go on with. Mr. DONALDSON : They 're going to vote for Bush? Ms. ROBERTS : Well, it 's a question of whether they vote at all. Mr. DONALDSON : Not everyone can stay home. Ms. ROBERTS : But a lot of people- first of all, a lot of people do. Mr. WILL : Half of them do, yes. Ms. ROBERTS : And secondly, in a year when no one 's motivated to turn out, a lot more can. Mr. DONALDSON : But I 'll bet you in this election, unless we get just really have come back in the good times- when I say we 're coming out of the recession, I do n't think we 're going to really get to the point where we 're all rolling once again. Unless that happens, I think people will vote this November. If they 're mad as hell and they 're not going to take it anymore, I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. BRINKLEY : Well, there 's one fallout from the politics already and that is that the Director of the National Endowment for the Arts, John Frohnmayer, has been fired by President Bush, probably because he had become a somewhat controversial and maybe unpopular figure in certain parts of the country among certain people by awarding grants to producers, artists, they were called, making obscene objects of various kinds. Is that a fallout? Is this the right time to do that politically? Mr. WILL : Well, this is the right time, In fact, there 's no good time to have a chairman of the NEA. There should n't be an NEA. You know, if the government wants to subsidize soybeans, fine. Maybe it 's a good idea, maybe it 's a bad idea. We can argue about it because there is a consensus in society as to what a soybean is. There is no consensus in America today as to what art is and a lot of what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people whose taxes are being taken to subsidize it. Now, there was a time, David, when Walt Whitman wrote poetry, and Aiken painted paintings without a government subsidy. Amazing things happened in this country before the government got involved and the idea that we, with a $400 billion deficit, need this little object of contention is absurd. Mr. DONALDSON : Well, Frohnmayer was thrown overboard in a rather cowardly act because of Buchanan and politics, but then, that 's what you do in political seasons. But it 's an issue on which I agree with George. I want government money to have government controls on it- against discrimination, in other ways, and I do n't think the artistic community ought to have controls on it. Mr. WILL : Well, there again- Mr. DONALDSON : Therefore, I am against government money going to that. Ms. ROBERTS : Aside from the larger question of whether there should be an NEA, the question of keeping- Mr. BRINKLEY : Should we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROBERTS : Aside from that question, though, which we 've addressed here, is the question of keeping this guy on as chairman, which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever in a political year. Why on earth should a president have that baggage around his neck? It might not be a very nice thing to do to just throw him overboard the minute that Buchanan gets that percentage of the votes, but hey- Mr. DONALDSON : Yeah, be honest about it. Say, " Look, Buchanan is attacking me and I 'm just vulnerable here because Buchanan is saying that art such as an individual urinating on the stage is n't really art where taxpayers want their money spent, therefore, off with your head. " At least, that would have the advantage of being candid. Ms. ROBERTS : Well, that 's true and it might also be something that you could take south. Mr. BRINKLEY : Does anyone feel he 's always able to say what is art and what is not? Anyone here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, no and that 's why I do n't want the government trying to say what is art and not art, but if it 's taxpayer money, I think controls are inevitable. Mr. BRINKLEY : So do we need a National Endowment at all? George? Mr. WILL : No. Mr. BRINKLEY : Sam? Mr. DONALDSON : Not with government funding. Mr. BRINKLEY : Cokie? Ms. ROBERTS : Well, I- it is true that we give fewer government dollars to the arts than any other country, but I suppose we do n't much need to give any. Mr. BRINKLEY : Well, we survived a long time without it and we may wind up doing so again. Anyway, the line-item veto has come into discussion lately - George, among others, has brought it up - and the White House has been saying for some time that the President and his staff or his advisers believed he already had, in the Constitution the right to a line-item veto and was waiting for the correct law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a test of it. Why have they not done it? George? Mr. WILL : The problem is this, David, The founding fathers gave the Executive a qualified negative. He can veto legislation and it can be overridden by the Congress. That 's all very well and good. The first appropriations bill for this country could have been typed, double-spaced, on one sheet of paper. Now, we get 43-pound, 320-page bills and the President 's veto power is virtually obviated because he must either take the whole damn thing or veto it and throw the country into chaos. Line-item veto will enable him to go through and say, " Whoops, that subsidy for the study of endives in Arkansas, out, and that bicycle path down there " and you could then say that- Mr. BRINKLEY : The Lawrence Welk Museum, you must be talking about. Mr. WILL : -that what the Congress and its various committees consider separately, the President should be able to veto separately. Mr. DONALDSON : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROBERTS : Well, first of all, the President is not- it 's not obviated because the President has vetoed - this President - 23 bills and had them sustained, so he 's using the veto- Mr. WILL : But 2,000 deserved to be. Ms. ROBERTS : He 's using the veto power and using it quite effectively. Secondly, the difference between that first Congress and now is a whole lot more states and what happens when you get Congress working together, aside from the little quirky things here and there which work fine, you know, fine for various things - one man 's pork is another man 's very important project - is that you have interests coming together. And if, in fact, one person can sit as emperor in the White House and say, " I disagree with the interests of Utah, but I agree with the interests of Louisiana, " at that point, there is no reason for the Senator from Utah to make any kind of agreement, so nothing would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ log-rolling stops. Ms. ROBERTS : You would have no legislation whatsoever happening. You would not have anything. Mr. WILL : We need much less legislation than we 're getting. You 've just made my argument. Ms. ROBERTS : You 've got to appropriate for agencies. Mr. DONALDSON : I just want to say that I agree with her. Cokie 's right. Mr. BRINKLEY : All right, we agreed on something, so I want to change the subject. Under the Civil Rights Act, minorities are supposed to have an equal chance at the ballot box and so that has led, among much else, to some voting districts of very funny shapes. Currently, in North Carolina, there is new district created and it looks like- it looks like ketchup- Mr. WILL : A worm. Mr. BRINKLEY : -ketchup spilled on a kitchen floor, is that it looks like. That runs from way over there in the West, down to the South Carolina line, about halfway- that 's a voting district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any sense? Mr. WILL : This is just the logic of affirmative action carried to a little bit of an extreme. That is, now political power is an entitlement. It used to be we had this quaint theory - I think it was called democracy - the voters picked the politicians. Now, you see the politicians with their computers pick the voters and this is- Mr. DONALDSON : Do they? But let me tell you- Ms. ROBERTS : Well, this is- Mr. DONALDSON : Cokie, let me just tell them why that line- it is a silly line. I ca n't defend that kind of line as you saw it on the map. Mr. BRINKLEY : It follows a highway. Mr. DONALDSON : That 's right- in order to create a district where blacks can elect one of their own. Mr. BRINKLEY : That 's fine. Mr. DONALDSON : But the original idea was to do it in the southeast corner of the state where there are a great number of black Americans and Native Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hefner and Rose, so in order to protect their seats, the legislature, in its wisdom, came up with that funny scribble. Mr. BRINKLEY : That congressional district- on one side of the road, you 're in one district and on the other side of the road, for about 50 miles, you 're on the other. Mr. DONALDSON : But if you 'd done it logically in the southeast corner of the state, you would n't have had that kind of squiggle. Ms. ROBERTS : And in general, what we 're having with these black districts, however, is affirmative action for Republicans. That 's what it is. What has happened is this very cynical move to put blacks together into one district and find, in this case, every black in the state and put them in one district so that the remaining districts are lily-white and therefore much more Republican than they would be otherwise. Mr. WILL : The question is should the government care? Should it be public policy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with a certain kind of skin pigmentation? Government should n't be in the business of sorting people out on these grounds. The Constitution of the United States mandates a free society, not an integrated society, not this, that and the other society. Mr. DONALDSON : Well, what a wonderful position. If all districts, of course, were drawn equally and drawn in nice, neat little squares, letting the chips fall where they may, that argument might be okay- should the government care. But since most districts are drawn in order to protect people like Hefner and Rose - good, white, solid Americans - then yes, the government should care- Mr. WILL : Sam, when we have- Mr. DONALDSON : -to try to enfranchise other people. Mr. WILL : When we have term limits, none of this is going to matter. Mr. BRINKLEY : Well- Mr. DONALDSON : If we wait till we have term limits- Ms. ROBERTS : I want to make sure- Mr. BRINKLEY : Our time is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to fix it so that the majority of female- Mr. BRINKLEY : -time is up. We 'll be back- Ms. ROBERTS : -population gets districts. Mr. BRINKLEY : -with a few words about Washington bureaucrats who know what 's good for you even if you do n't, in a moment. Commercial break Mr. BRINKLEY : Finally, President Bush, in his State of the Union speech, said he would order a stop, for a limited time, to the issuing of new government regulations. Well, there are so many of these that a government newspaper, called The Federal Register, prints nothing but new rules and regulations. Well, why Mr. Bush stopped it temporarily was not clear, but it is clear that manufacturers complain they are drenched - indeed, drowned - in a constant flood of new regulations, each one requiring another label, another sticker, another warning. In a quick count at one bathroom, there were 50 warnings, some of them useful and necessary and some quite silly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it, The Federal Register bulges and it includes such warnings as a label on paint cans, saying do not drink it and an label on an electric hair dryer, saying, " Do not use while sleeping. " What would we do without Washington to look after all of us? For all of us here at ABC News, until next week, thank you.
