236641 @!ROBERT-SIEGEL-HOS : This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I 'm Robert Siegel. NOAH ADAMS, HOST : And I 'm Noah Adams. Last week, nearly 500 experts on the personal and family needs of American workers gathered in Miami for the annual meeting of The Association of Work-Life Professionals. Some of the research presented there showed that a majority of workers with families have workloads that seriously interfere with life outside the job. As the personnel directors, consultants and research directors pondered what to do about the problem, they got advice from two visionaries. NPR 's David Molpus reports. DAVID MOLPUS, NPR REPORTER : Betty Friedan helped ignite the modern women 's movement 35 years ago with her book " The Feminine Mystic : a Clarion call for Women 's Right to Pursue Achievements Beyond Home and Family. " Now, her focus is on redesigning work so that women can better care for their children and be involved in their communities. In an appearance before the Association of Work-Life Professionals, Friedan said subsidized child care, shorter work weeks, flextime, and benefits for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for men. To establish a more humane workplace, Friedan says feminists need to view men as allies, not as enemies. BETTY FRIEDAN, AUTHOR, " THE FEMININE MYSTIQUE " AND " BEYOND GENDER " : It 's more than the women 's movement. It 's got to be women and men. We are not going to get anywhere until those are considered as much men 's issues as women 's issues @!MOLPUS Betty Friedan spells out her ideas in her most recent book, " Beyond Gender : The New Politics of Work and Family. " She points to some of the difficulties created, in part by feminism 's success, namely that in the process of breaking down career barriers, a deficit has developed in the non-work parts of life. Too many women, she says, have bought into the male culture of work, a culture that Friedan says is immersed in status and greed @!FRIEDAN You can look at our society at the moment and say there 's a big stagnant pond with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the bottom line has to be redefined. The concept of success -- whether personal, individual success, family success, corporate success. We do n't need to be such a nation of workaholics. You know, I mean we have to be life-aholics @!MOLPUS Friedan, who turned 77 last week, is showing her age. Her remarks in Miami were sometimes rambling. She walked slowly and deliberately, yet in some respects she 's as alert and feisty as ever. When a man tried to help her off the platform, she jerked away sharply, making it under her own power. When asked if women can handle all the stresses on them today, she growled that women have always juggled a lot -- it 's just that what they juggle has changed @!FRIEDAN I 'm not going to moan and groan about the stress on women and all that. That is one of things that makes women out-live men by eight years. That flexibility is what women have a strength that lasts longer than men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ally in the cause of reengineering our worklives in another speaker at the Miami conference, Gerald Celente, author of " Trends 2000, " a best selling on all sorts of American habits and desires, at work and at play. Celente sees signs of overload in the phenomenon of short-term memory loss that many people in their 40s now experience -- what some call " senior moments, " when you walk into a room and ca n't remember why, or you turn on the washing machine but forget to put in any clothes. These are all signs of stress, Celente says, and reactions to being constantly bombarded with information that we are unable to process. GERALD CELENTE, AUTHOR : One of the striking things to me in working with so many businesses so often is that how little time people have to think, and to read and to learn. And that 's why so many companies are off trend, because they ca n't see the changes happening, because they do n't take the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are becoming increasingly disenchanted with this noisy, frantic lifestyle, and are searching for a way out. That 's why he expects continued growth of an entrepreneurial spirit, with workers exiting corporations for smaller companies, or starting their own, to gain more control over their lives. He forecast that many will need help in making the transition to more balanced lives, and that will produce a growing demand for so- called " personal trainers. " CELENTE : People are really lost. They do n't know how they got to do what they 're doing. They may be good at what they 're doing, but they 're not enjoying it. They 're feeling that they 're living a life and not being fulfilled. It 's a struggle out there. So, personal trainers help people -- they 're kind of like a judge in some ways that you tell the judge the story and they give you the verdict that can help point them in a direction that they need, and bring out those hidden gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corporate uniform and the corporate culture @!MOLPUS Gerald Celente says the main challenge for employers is to create work environments that allow multiple forms of flexibility and creativity, recognizing that the best workers are less and less willing to give their whole life to a job. A lot of companies claim to be doing that already. Their talk often outpaces their action. But Celente and others at the Work-Life Professionals Conference are encouraged that the rhetoric, at least, is on the right track. I 'm David Molpus, NPR News. #
