Everybody in the universe is going to see it. @!Ms-WATSON : Mm-hmm. @!SMITH : So with all that taken care of, let 's just talk about some important stuff and about you in this movie in particular. And one of the wonderful things about this, because there 's a lot of back story... @!Ms-WATSON : Yeah. @!SMITH :... and there are flashbacks... @!Ms-WATSON : Yeah. @!SMITH :... how many years since the first movie? @!Ms-WATSON : Six. @!SMITH : Six? @!Ms-WATSON : Six years, yeah. @!SMITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, what do you see? @!Ms-WATSON : I see a little girl with chubby cheeks and hair that 's out here. It 's really weird, actually. It 's so strange, like, there 's so many -- as you say, there 's so many flashbacks in this one. I remember just watching it and being, like, Wow, we 've changed so much. ' @!SMITH : Yeah, yeah. @!Ms-WATSON : It 's amazing. @!SMITH : Do you like what you see? @!Ms-WATSON : It 's kind of painful in a way because it 's kind of embarrassing, but at the same time it 's kind of like, Oh, yeah, we were cute. ' @!SMITH : We were cute. ' @!Ms-WATSON : So mixed feelings. @!SMITH : Ah, you 're still cute. You 're still very, very cute. Another important question, because I 've read that you really love these books, right? @!Ms-WATSON : Mm-hmm. Yeah. @!SMITH : This book in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!Ms-WATSON : Yes. @!SMITH :... they could n't possibly put everything in. @!Ms-WATSON : I know. @!SMITH : What drove you nuts about -- what was -- what did they leave out that drove you nuts in particular? @!Ms-WATSON : Well, I was particularly excited about shooting all of the stuff with the house elves... @!SMITH : Right. @!Ms-WATSON :... like Hermione starting up SPEW, and just, like -- just that whole story line of her taking care of the house elves... @!SMITH : Mm. Mm-hmm. @!Ms-WATSON :... and her, like -- and all of it got cut and none of it made it. And I remember just, yeah, calling up David Heyman, who 's the producer, I was like, I 've just picked up the script. It 's not in there. What 's going on? ' And he was just, like, Honey, we ca n't -- we ca n't have a three-hour film. ' I was like, Oh, OK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know. @!SMITH : Have you ever been in a movie house where the film 's playing, with a -- with a audience of normal folk, regular pedestrians? @!Ms-WATSON : I have n't, no. @!SMITH : Yeah. @!Ms-WATSON : I... @!SMITH : Because people, they read these books, they come to see the movies... @!Ms-WATSON : Mm. @!SMITH :... and they explode when they see something that 's really familiar. @!Ms-WATSON : I know, yeah. What I love more than anything else, especially when I 've seen it, like, a couple of times -- because I 've seen the film four or five times now... @!SMITH : Mm-hmm. @!Ms-WATSON :... is that I just tend to just turn around in my seat and not watch the film but just watch everyone else 's reaction. @!SMITH : Yes. @!Ms-WATSON : Because it 's so rewarding to see which bits people laugh at... @!SMITH : Mm-hmm. @!Ms-WATSON :... and which bits they enjoy... @!SMITH : Yeah. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to see if anyone cries. @!SMITH : Yeah. @!Ms-WATSON : I mean, I actually bawled my eyes out when... @!SMITH : Oh. @!Ms-WATSON :... I do n't want to ruin it, but someone dies. @!SMITH : Do n't, do n't. Yeah, sh, sh, sh. @!Ms-WATSON : Yeah, so it 's good to see. It 's really rewarding. @!SMITH : Yeah, yeah.
