4031441 ANNOUNCER : Three, two, one -- Beck! @!GLENN-BECK-HOST : Welcome! Welcome to THE GLENN @!BECK PROGRAM. Tonight, the president has fired an inspector general. Hmm. Why? Well, we do know that the inspector general started to investigate one of the president 's friends. Connected? We 're going to talk to that inspector general live in just a few minutes. Also, $134 billion in a suitcase, and nobody is talking about this. Why is that? We 'll explain that. And, common sense solutions to the world 's problems. If you believe this country is great but the government is like a Frankenstein monster? Bring out the monster! Grab your torch and come, follow me! @(MUSIC) @!BECK : That Glenn Beck -- I 'll tell you, that Glenn Beck, he is inciting riots. Did you hear him? He was saying, " Grab your torches! " Hello, America. The Obama administration is pitching government-run health care -- oh, it will be perfect -- to cover 46 million uninsured Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, some members of his own party -- you know, just regular old folk. Tonight, here is the One Thing : The president is going to give you a lot of malarkey. He 's going to give you the headline, but to understand what this plan is really about, you need to go behind the scenes, and listen to what these arrogant people have been saying now for years on what the real plan is. A friend of mine sent a video from verumserum.com, and I went -- I brought it in this morning and I said, " You 've got to see this. " We checked out all the sources. It checks out. We added some new things to Verum Serum 's great idea. Watch this. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!PRES-BARACK-OBAMA, : I happened to be a proponent of a single-payer universal health care plan. @(APPLAUSE) @!OBAMA- : But as all of you know, we may not get there immediately. Because first, we have to take back the White House and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've said is, let 's set up a system where if you already have health care through your employer and you 're happy with it, you do n't have to change doctors, you do n't have to change plans -- nothing changes. If you do n't have health care or you 're highly unsatisfied with your health care, then let 's give you choices, let 's give you options, including a public plan that you could enroll in and sign up for -- that 's been my proposal. @!KATHLEEN-SEBELIUS, : What I 'm a believer in, and certainly the president is a believer in, is that competition often is a very healthy component of any market situation. So, in the design of a health insurance exchange -- which is really what we 're talking about and what the president discusses -- a choice of a variety of options is often critical. @!DR-JACOB-HACKER-N : So, what I 'm arguing for is a system in which both public and private plans -- with their unique strengths and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that all Americans -- not just the elderly or the poor -- have access to the distinctive strength of a public health insurance plan as well as the strengths of private plans. @!REP-JAN-SCHAKOWSKY : And next to me was a guy from the insurance company who then argued against the public health insurance option, saying it would n't let private insurance compete ; that a public option will put the private insurance industry out of business and -- @(CHEERS) @!SCHAKOWSKY : My single-payer friends, he was right! The man was right. @!HACKER : Someone once said to me, this is a Trojan Horse for single- payer, and I said, " Well, it 's not a Trojan Horse, right? It 's just right there. " I 'm telling you, we 're going to get there over time, slowly, but we 'll move away from reliance on employment-based health insurance, as we should, but we 'll do it in a way that we 're not going to frighten people into thinking they are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give them a choice of public and private insurance when their pool, and we 're going to let them keep their private employment-based insurance if their employer continues to provide that. @!SCHAKOWSKY : This is not a principled fight. This is a fight about strategy for getting there and I believe we will. @!OBAMA- : As Congress moves forward on health care legislation in the coming weeks, there are going to be different ideas and disagreements about how to achieve this goal. I welcome all ideas ; we 've got to have a good debate. What I will not welcome, I will not accept, is endless delays or a denial that reform needs to happen. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!BECK : You know, I have told you, for a while now, that this is -- I mean, did you notice some of the names involved here, especially the Tides Foundation. Tides Foundation -- gee, oh, we know them, because they bailed out ACORN. There are people and forces behind some of these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not telling you the truth -- I 'm sorry. We 're not listening to the truth. They are telling us, and you just saw what 's coming our way. @!Dr-Brian-McDonough# @!DR-BRIAN-MCDONOUGH : What you just saw was an argument being laid out designed to tell people there could be a one-payer system, but that it could happen drastically over time. In other words, slowly but surely get the insurance companies out of the picture, maybe the little ones first and then the bigger ones. @!BECK : Right. And that happens because like -- for instance, here in New York, it is almost impossible to be able to be a company and stay in business with the way they have rigged the insurance system here in New York City. @!MCDONOUGH : And one of the problems you are going to get is, if employers have to pay into the insurance and employees have to pay in for insurance, if they 're taxed or in some other form. @!BECK : Sure. @!MCDONOUGH :. they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do this, it 's getting too expensive, " and they will either bail out and they 'll be in another system. And, you know, the government can kind of wait around with their system forever until it takes over. @!BECK : I 'm small businessman and I run a company, and we take care of our employees, and we pay 100 percent of their medical insurance. The insurance plan that we have is the best in the state. We -- our insurance broker said, " You are the only company still in the state of New York still offering this to your employees. " And I said to him, " We 'll do it as long as we can. " But I know there are companies who want to provide it but they ca n't do it anymore, and now Obama is saying that companies, like mine, or other people 's companies, they 'll get taxed because their plan is too good. We 're going towards a sea of mediocrity. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is you want fair competition, but in addition, we ca n't lose the important issue. The important issue is providing early care, preventive care, getting people access to care initially. And that is n't necessarily insurance-driven or government-driven. That 's getting people access to care so you do n't spend tens of thousands of dollars at the end. You help people out early. That 's what care is all about. @!BECK : I was -- I was amazed at how Sebelius said, " Often competition is important. " Can you think of a time when competition is not important in America? @!MCDONOUGH : I mean, it 's the whole principle, competition is good. And with competition, usually, things get better, and if you allow the competition to occur, it should get better. @!BECK : OK. Let me -- let me play something here. Could you play the piece of Barack Obama today talking about General Motors and Chrysler, comparing this? Do we have that? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Motors and Chrysler into trouble in recent decades were the huge costs they racked up providing health care for their workers, costs that made them less profitable and less competitive with automakers around the world. If we do not fix our health care system, America may go the way of G.M. -- paying more, getting less and going broke. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!BECK : This is -- this is amazing to me, that he wants to fix health care. It 's not the unions. The unions, they got their share. Everybody is fine. Nothing happened there. It 's the healthcare problem that caused G.M. to go down. @!MCDONOUGH : Well, and one of the concerns I have is this need to do it immediately. I think time is good. If you 're looking at something that has so much money and there is so much at stake in our nation 's health care, and there is nothing more important in my life and physicians, and all our lives as human beings living on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. We do n't have to rush it through. This is n't a stimulus package. We should do it over time and look at all the options. @!BECK : He 's not going to. He 's not going to. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. All right. I want to show this to the members of the press corps that might be watching right now. It 's called the Pulitzer Prize. People like you at the " New York Times " could win one. I 'll show you how. I want to tell you about a story that is coming out of Washington that you probably have n't heard anywhere. Byron York, he is the chief political correspondent for " The Washington Examiner " -- is here to explain. Byron, can you tell me what happened on Thursday night in Washington? @!BYRON-YORK-WASHIN : It was a very strange event. There are officials called inspectors general at all the federal agencies. And their job is to investigate allegations of stolen money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Because they do what they do, they often run afoul and irritate their bosses or politically appointed. They sometimes irritate the White House. So, because of all that, Congress gave them special job protections. There was a law passed last year that said, if the president wants to fire an inspector general, he has to give Congress 30 days notice and he has to tell them why he is doing it. What happened last -- @!BECK : Wait, wait. I want to make sure I have that law. That 's a new law? @!YORK : Well, you know, it was passed in 2008, and one of its cosponsors was, as a matter of fact, Senator Barack Obama. @!BECK : Oh, wow. OK. @!YORK : What happened -- @!BECK : So, wait, what -- what does it say again? Thirty days notice and you have to let Congress -- @!YORK : Thirty days notice and cause. He has to give Congress the reason why he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, that sounds like a good plan. You do n't want anybody to intimidate the inspectors general. You want to be able to make sure -- @!YORK : Exactly. You want -- you want to protect them from political retribution. @!BECK : Sure. @!YORK : So, you 've heard of the AmeriCorps program, which is the big national service program, just got a huge tripling and a huge $5.7 billion bill a couple of months ago. There is the inspector general for the AmeriCorps program. And he got a phone call last Wednesday evening and it was from the White House Counsel 's office. And the White House Counsel 's office told him that he had one hour to either resign or be fired. Now, he is an inspector general, covered by all these protections, and they told him you got one hour to resign or you 're out. @!BECK : Did he resign? @!YORK : He did not. He refused, and what happened was the next day, Congress -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this inspector general but he did n't give a reason. He sort of -- the president sort of suggested there might be a reason. And what we know right now is that this inspector general did a rather controversial investigation of a friend and political supporter of the president, a man named Kevin Johnson, former NBA star who is now the mayor of Sacramento, California. And before he was mayor, Johnson had a non- profit group for children called St. HOPE, and there were allegations that Johnson had misused thousands and thousands of dollars in federal AmeriCorps grants. And the inspector general whose name is Gerald Walpin investigated and found out that it was true -- that Johnson had used this money to have AmeriCorps employees wash his car and run personal errands for him and all sorts of stuff. So, Johnson did an investigation -- excuse me, Gerald Walpin, the inspector general, did an investigation and confirmed all of these things. And his report made a number of people high up in the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Johnson, right? @!YORK : He is, indeed. Johnson is a supporter of the president and has made jokes about, you know, playing basketball with the president. Of course, Johnson was a big NBA star. @!BECK : You know, I 'll tell you, Byron, thank you, great reporting in " The Washington Examiner. " And hang around, because I actually want you to further this story for us tomorrow. I wish I had a chance to -- oh, my gosh, I do have a chance, to talk to the guy who was terminated. Gerald Walpin is with us now. How are you, sir? @!GERALD-WALPIN-FMR : I am fine. Thank you, and glad to be here. @!BECK : OK. I read this story. You were in your car. You get a phone call from the White House. @!WALPIN : Yes. @!BECK : Any idea that they were going to ask you to resign? @!WALPIN : No, because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House had called me already three, four times already in the last two weeks because I happened to be -- you might disagree with this -- a supporter of Sonia Sotomayor, even though I 'm conservative. @!BECK : OK. @!WALPIN : And they had asked me for help on that and to support her, and I was doing that. So, I thought this was the same phone call. @!BECK : OK. And you -- you are a conservative. @!WALPIN : Yes. @!BECK : But you 're not -- I mean, obviously, you 're endorsing Sotomayor, so you 're -- you know, you 're an open-minded guy, and you have gone after Republicans in the past? @!WALPIN : Oh, yes, I have. @!BECK : Who have you gone after? @!WALPIN : Well, I prosecuted Roy Cohn, for example. I was also disclosed as the person responsible for the indictments against Nixon 's cabinet members Mitchell and Stans. @!BECK : So, you 're not a -- you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Well, I believe when I 'm doing my work, I call the cards as they come out. @!BECK : OK. So, gosh, he has n't given you a reason on why you have been terminated. @!WALPIN : No. @!BECK : I have read the letter. It does n't -- it just does -- it says it just basically that he does n't have faith in you. @!WALPIN : Well, that 's a conclusion. That 's not a reason. @!BECK : Now, you not only went after one of his good friends, Kevin Johnson, but you 're after going after CUNY, which is City University of New York. @!WALPIN : Which is a good university -- and, in fact, I 'm an alumnus of it -- and is doing a good job in getting teachers. But the problem is, the AmeriCorps people have put almost $80 million into that program, even though the teachers at CUNY agree to be teachers before they 're even told that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : So, your job, as I understand it, is to track down money that is being wasted or is being misused. @!WALPIN : Exactly. @!BECK : My tax dollars, Erin 's tax dollars, everyone 's tax dollars. @!WALPIN : That is correct. The AmeriCorps program and the other agency programs and services I believe are great as long as they are properly managed and the money is not abused or misused. @!BECK : Why do you think this is happening? @!WALPIN : I can only say that I became a thorn in the side of someone, and because I was doing my job and I was fired for doing my job. And by the way, the investigation, for example, of Johnson, was started by the agency itself. AmeriCorps management called us and asked us to investigate reports they had heard that there was wrongdoing, and we. @!BECK : Were you ever pressured to stop it? @!WALPIN : No. @!BECK : Were you ever. @!WALPIN : No. @!BECK : Did anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The only thing -- the only thing that had came up was after Johnson was elected mayor, after the stimulus money came in, there was great media and political pressure to get him off the hook and get his suspension lifted. @!BECK : This happened on Thursday. Do you remember the case when. @!WALPIN : Wednesday night. @!BECK : Wednesday night. Do you remember the case when George Bush fired those attorneys which he had the right to do? @!WALPIN : They were serving at his. @!BECK : At his discretion. @!WALPIN :. discretion. @!BECK : Yes. You are not serving at the president 's discretion. @!WALPIN : Only he can -- under the statute which is intended to protect the independence of inspector generals, I could be terminated only if he gives 30 days advance notice and gives the reason for it to Congress. @!BECK : Got it. So, it 's all open and everybody knows. @!WALPIN : That 's correct. @!BECK : Right. OK. That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!BECK : Because if somebody does n't -- if somebody does n't -- if somebody can put pressure on you, well, then, you 're no good to anybody. @!WALPIN : That is correct. @!BECK : OK. So. @!WALPIN : And by the way, the fact that pressure was placed on me and that I was terminated is going to have a chilling effect on all the other inspectors general. @!BECK : Why do you say that? @!WALPIN : Because they know that if they do something wrong to somebody who is liked by somebody else or for whatever reason, they can be terminated, too. @!BECK : Are you familiar with RAT, the new thing under the stimulus package? Is Byron still on with us? Byron? @!YORK : Yes, here I am! @!BECK : Can you explain RAT -- the thing tucked into the stimulus package that no one wants to claim now? @!YORK : This is a Recovery Accountability and Transparency board. And, you know, one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill did was promised it would all be transparent and there would be a lot of accountability. So, they created this new board. The problem was the board was given the power to tell inspectors general to conduct an investigation or probably, more importantly, to not conduct investigations. Senator Charles Grassley, who is the Republican senator who is kind of a guardian angel of inspectors general got very concerned about that and made some noise about it, but could n't stop it from being in the bill. So, there is possibly another threat to the independence of inspectors general. @!BECK : What do you think about that? @!WALPIN : I now know what you were talking about, and that 's a horrible provision in the statute. @!BECK : Why would they do it? @!WALPIN : Why? I think, in view of the fact that they terminated me, that they do n't want inspectors generals doing the job that they were hired to do -- which is to objectively look at the facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!BECK : How long you been in government? @!WALPIN : On this stint? Just 2 1/2 years. @!BECK : How long total? I mean, you. @!WALPIN : Oh, I 've been -- I was a prosecutor in the U.S. Attorneys Office in New York, where, as I said, I prosecuted Roy Cohn, and I -- so, I have had over 10 years of government service, but I was in private practice when President Bush 's White House called me. @!BECK : Have you seen anything like this before? @!WALPIN : No. This is shocking. I know of no other inspector general who has been terminated on this method, and the call to me -- look, as you can tell, I 'm not a young guy, and I did n't need this. But I felt that I could n't look myself in the mirror if I just resigned to this pressure. @!BECK : What 's your next step? @!WALPIN : Oh, I 'm considering all alternatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public know, because as Franklin Roosevelt said, the great -- sunshine is the greatest. @!BECK : Yes. @!WALPIN : What was the word? @!BECK : I know what you 're saying. @!WALPIN : Disinfectant! @!BECK : Yes. @!WALPIN : I want the public to know and I want other inspectors general to know that they can stand up, too. @!BECK : Thank you, sir. @!WALPIN : Thank you. @!BECK : We will follow this story and we 'll have more on this tomorrow. There are really nasty things going on, and sunshine. And again -- hey, " New York Times, want to know why you 're dying on the vine? Because you 're blaming Bill O'Reilly for crazy people shooting people. Here -- you want this? This is a Pulitzer Prize. Why do n't you investigate what 's going on in Washington? It 's everywhere. Now, two men caught carrying $134 billion in U.S. bonds. They might be fake, which would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be worse. I 'll explain, and ask why no one is covering it. @!BECK : Well, I have been -- today 's show, there is a lot of weird stuff going on. One of them I want to tell you about that nobody is talking about is : China is buying up hard assets. I 've been telling you that for a while. They 're divesting from the United States and the dollar. Well, now, there 's even more signs that China is trying to pour concrete to protect itself in case the dollar would collapse. According to a congressman from Illinois, Kirk, China is planning to buy another $80 billion worth of gold, which at today 's prices would nearly triple its reserves. Additionally, China is working on adding another giant pipeline from Russia, and in the meantime, they have increased their monthly oil supply by about 5 percent. Now, this is another story that shows that we are vulnerable to something. But listen to this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? There is a fake bond scam -- we think -- two middle-aged Japanese men reportedly caught trying to cross from Italy into Switzerland with $134 billion in bonds -- $134 billion, remember that number. It presents two possibilities and both are really bad. Either they 're fake which means people are trying to flood the market with fake cash, and it 's probably a country doing that, because remember, bonds are the same as cash, or worse, it 's real, and some country, some sovereign fund is trying to quietly dump their reserves. It would have to be a country if they 're real, because nobody has this much money. That is 1 percent of our GDP. With me now is Joe Weisenthal. He is the editor of BusinessInsider.com. Joe, are you surprised this is n't everywhere? @!JOE-WEISENTHAL-ED : I 'm stunned. It 's a -- it 's a really interesting story, either of the scenarios you suggest, real or fake. I just wish there were more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it or some of the mainstream press. @!BECK : Well, we just. @!WEISENTHAL :. would go after them for some answers. @!BECK : We just got " no comment " from the Treasury Department. They said, " We have received your question about U.S. bonds -- we 've received your question about U.S. bonds seized at the Italian border. These bonds are evidence in an ongoing investigation. We will not be able to comment at this time. Sorry we ca n't be of more help. U.S. Treasury. " One hundred thirty-four billion dollars of bonds. Can we put the chart up on which countries have that much? Here are the top foreign holders of U.S. treasuries : China, $763 billion ; Japan, $685 billion ; United kingdom, $152 billion ; Russia $137 billion ; the value of the smuggled bonds, $134 billion. That 's gigantic sums of money. @!WEISENTHAL : Either way, it 's an incredible scale, whether it 's a government dumping some of their holdings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike anything we 've ever seen, not just in size but also sophistication. The fact that it 's this long before they can just dismiss them saying as being fake or say these are real. @!BECK : Right. So, who would have the technology to fake that? Would that be North Korea. @!WEISENTHAL : I would imagine any government that prints currency could probably procure a printer, you know, extremely high quality printer. @!BECK : Right. So, this would be a -- you think only possibly a government would be able to do this? @!WEISENTHAL : It would be the kind of technology that you would expect only a government to have. @!BECK : OK. And if they are real, this is -- this is -- what? @!WEISENTHAL : Every day the market wakes up to some news that someone in Russia or China or Japan making some comment on the dollar, either they 're getting nervous about holding it, or some days they come out and say they 're confident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge in this question, will foreign governments keep buying our debt? So, if it is real and if there is a foreign government that sort of secretly trying to dump some of their dollar holdings, that 's a big story, that really tips the story in one direction. @!BECK : Apparently, these bonds are old and they come from the ' 50s and the ' 60s. @!WEISENTHAL : Well, that 's one of the questions that makes people questions the veracity. These types of bonds, Kennedy bonds, supposedly would be issued in the ' 50s or ' 60s. The reason that there were -- I mean, $500 million face value bonds, it 's almost hard to believe that we ever issued those. Apparently, the reason was, you know, there are bear bonds, you have to send in a coupon and collect the money. Well, if you 're borrowing a lot of money, you want to have huge coupons, because otherwise it 's just too much of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!WEISENTHAL : There were some reports that said the date on the bond was from 1934. That would lend credence to the idea that it 's some sort of counterfeit fraud operation. @!BECK : OK. Thank you very much. We 'll follow this, because, one way or another, it 's not good. Somebody is trying to print massive amounts of our money and -- which would be -- well, our Fed is doing it ; our treasury is doing it, why not everybody? And the other is : people are starting to tire of our nonsense here. And if you 're tired of the nonsense and you 're ready for some common sense, tomorrow is your day. " The Glenn Beck 's Common Sense : The Case Against an Out-of-Control Government " is available. You can order it today in time for Father 's Day this Sunday. It is in bookstores, most of the bookstores have it tonight, but it 's officially in bookstores tomorrow. Speaking of common sense, how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now, how does the government want to save money on electricity? Oh, you 'll never guess. Next. @!BECK : Hello, America. Here is tonight 's hot list - common sense solutions to stories the mainstream media is not really doing their job on. The House of Representatives researching new ways to save electricity and save money. They have proposed demonstration projects run by the House of Representatives. It will cost $25 million. Here 's one way to save money. Do n't spend $25 million on demonstration projects. Another? Click. Turn the lights off when you 're not using them. My mother used to say that, " Turn these lights off! " It 's just that simple. Deadly protests in the streets of Iran after the re-election of President Ahmadinejad. Again, I 'm just looking at that - no, those are the L.A. riots. No, can we put the - it 's the wrong video. We were rioting because, you know, we won a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riot and set things on fire. But now charges of election fraud by the reform candidate - you know, causing some problems in Iran. Iran 's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has ordered an investigation, which is great, because, really, I have been waiting for somebody to say this on television all weekend - none of this matters. None of it. Iran is a theocracy. It means it is run by a group of unelected people called the guardian council. These are mullahs. These are people - look, sometimes you ca n't see the beam in your own eye. And so you look at the little sliver in somebody else 's eye. That 's what is happening here. When you watch, this we have been fascinated, saying, " Oh, my gosh! Look at these people. " And people on television are starting to say, " Oh, my gosh. Look at the people who are so frustrated with the status quo. They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a reformer here. " @!No-They-are-taking# And there is really no difference between the two parties. It is almost what is happening in Iran. You know, they might - one might be for women 's rights and the other is not for women 's rights. But they both answer to the mullahs. They 're not going to make any real big difference. They are a theocracy. We are being run on both sides of the aisle by these gigantic progressives. Look at the last election here in America. Was it really that much difference between John McCain and Barack Obama? I mean, did you hear what - what 's his name - Bill Maher said this weekend on Friday on his show? What really is the difference between Barack Obama and George W. Bush? Not direction, only speed. We 've taken to the streets here, though. We 're doing it peacefully, except for the Lakers game. Tea parties all across the country. Tea parties continue and common sense tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, did you catch the " New York Times " this weekend? Yes. Anyway, they published the third - count it, three - the third op ed in the " Times " blaming Bill O'Reilly and me, or FOX NEWS in general, of spreading hate and inspiring people like the killer of Dr. Tiller in Kansas. Also, we were the inspiration, apparently, for the guy at the Holocaust Museum last week. You know, there are groups out there that preach hate and violence and racial violence. There are groups so fed up they want to secede from the union. We are n't one of them. The " Times " goes after me and FOX NEWS. But was it ESPN that caused the riots there in Los Angeles? Or were the pinheads that just started things on fire? Common sense tells you that the " New York Times " is setting things up. They are laying the groundwork so when something goes wrong, like they always do, they will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Reilly or anybody else that they would like to silence. Speaking of the " New York Times, " " Politico " reports on the love affair between the Obama administration and the dinosaur called the " New York Times. " They point to the recent " Times " magazine report on healthcare. The reporter had seven - seven sit-down interviews. I mean, that 's almost - I mean, we have almost half of the op eds blaming us for bad things. They had seven interviews with the administration. By the way, that is twice the amount that they had in seven years covering the Bush administration. My concern is the " Times ' " obsession with Obama. Have you ever seen the definition of a cult? Check it out. I saw it this weekend. Webster 's Dictionary : " Cult - a great devotion to a person, idea, object, movement or work, especially such devotion regarded as literary or intellectual fad. " Sound familiar? The cult corps, not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list. Politicians want to keep us divided on the left and the right. The media was supposed to be the watchdog, but they are n't doing it. With outlets like the " New York Times " becoming cult followers, they 're keeping us divided. And that 's the way politicians need us to be. No matter what you hear in the press, no matter what you hear going on in your TV, do n't believe it. Americans are coming together. We are not as divided as the boob tube would have you believe. We 're coming together, in fact, like never before. Proof? Next. G. @!BECK : That 's the name of a book that comes out tomorrow. Here it is. It 's " Common Sense. " It was inspired by - I read Thomas Paine 's " Common Sense. " I reread it over the fall. And I 'll tell you a little bit more about it tomorrow. But a book I did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then stuck my courage to the sticking places. Is n't that the line? I would like you to pick it up tomorrow. There are a lot of things that I think nobody has said before. It is the case of an out-of-control government. Pick it up in bookstores everywhere. I 've been talking, you know, for a while now with the 9/12ers and I think people from both sides of the aisle feel the same way. Our government is out of control. It 's not Republicans saying this. It 's the Democrats, too. It 's just - when did we stop putting America first? Our next guest agrees. Nancy Armstrong, disenfranchised Democrat who now calls herself a patriot. She has a blog called " MisplacedDemocrats.com. " Nancy, when did you become disenfranchised? @!NANCY-ARMSTRONG-D : May 31st, 2008. G. @!BECK : What happened on May 31st? @!ARMSTRONG : It took me a lot - oh, that 's when I realized that the Democratic Party was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was it that happened? @!ARMSTRONG : Well, it was just the whole election going along, you know. Basically, what happened when they went to the rules and bylaws committee for the Democratic Party, and I realized at that point that they did n't represent me any longer, that they had really turned me under the bus. And you know what? I threw them back. G. @!BECK : So you - @!ARMSTRONG : As a matter of fact, I have thrown all parties back. G. @!BECK : Good for you. @!ARMSTRONG : I do n't want to be labeled by anything anymore. I just want to be a patriot. G. @!BECK : Good for you. @!ARMSTRONG : It is what I spent 13 years doing when I served my country and that 's what I want to continue doing. G. @!BECK : So you 're going to confuse the mainstream media so much right now because you 're a Democrat. You campaigned, actually - or did n't you, for Hillary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a volunteer in three states. The last state was Montana where I actually worked for her campaign. I was unpaid volunteer basically or unpaid worker. And I ran the Veterans for Hillary tour through 16 cities in Montana. G. @!BECK : OK. But you also now - you have started a tea party. You did a tea party. @!ARMSTRONG : Yes, sir, I did. Two of them in Wichita. G. @!BECK : But I thought - did you get a check from Karl Rove? I thought that was only Republicans doing that. @!ARMSTRONG : No, I did it myself. And I whipped up the frenzy in Wichita and the first tea party was 125 people. At the second tea party, it was more than 2,000. G. @!BECK : What is it that the main - @!ARMSTRONG : I 'm sorry. I think I whipped a little - go ahead. G. @!BECK : What is it the mainstream is missing because they are trying to paint anybody who goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or racists. Are you a racist? Do you hate black people? @!ARMSTRONG : Heavens, no. G. @!BECK : OK. @!ARMSTRONG : No. G. @!BECK : Are you a terrorist of some sort? Are you a danger to your country? @!ARMSTRONG : Heavens, no. I grew up in the liberal state of Massachusetts and my father was a Democrat. G. @!BECK : OK. @!ARMSTRONG : I do n't think that you could - G. @!BECK : What is it that the mainstream - can you summarize what is it that the mainstream media just ca n't get their arms around? Who are you? Who are the people that do these things? @!ARMSTRONG : Who are the people that do these things? They 're just average everyday people. A lot of my friends are disenfranchised Democrats and have attended tea parties and will continue to attend tea parties. And the mainstream media just does not want to accept the fact, and they have n't wanted to accept the fact that there are disenfranchised Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all supposed to be happy and marching behind the Democratic Party. G. @!BECK : I know. What I would like to do is see more of us march just behind our country. Thank you very much, Nancy. Now, on the other side, Republicans. There is another guy who thinks the Republicans stink on ice. And what he says he thinks you can do on the Fourth of July that maybe will bring us all together. That 's next. G. @!BECK : All right. A few minutes ago, I showed you a disenfranchised Democrat that started a tea party. And I ca n't see that on the mainstream any place else. Now, I 've got a disenfranchised Republican who says he is tired of the Republican Party. His name is Patrick Beck - no relation. He 's a chiropractor from Arizona. No relation, right? PATRICK @!BECK, DISENFRANCHISED REPUBLICAN : No relation. I 'm not going to ask you for any money. G. @!BECK : I was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. @!BECK : Not anytime soon. G. @!BECK : OK. So, Patrick, you are no longer a Republican. When did this happen to you? P. @!BECK : Basically, it happened when the financial industry kind of took a downturn. And I started to see the bailouts coming. I realized this is not the road of a conservative. And there is no longer represents what is going on. G. @!BECK : OK. So you 're doing something on July 4th. I have been asking when are people going to take to the streets? When are they going to the Capitol? When are they going to let the people hear them? You 've got something on July 4th. Explain. P. @!BECK : On July 4th, I had a tea party in my hometown and it worked rather well. I, personally - I do n't feel like the rah-rah routine is honestly going to do us any good. Showing up and doing the " Hell, no. We wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And one of the things we did at the tea party in my hometown was we had signup sheets. Now, this was n't to some organization. It was n't to some group. The idea was that we need to get people together. And when we find a candidate that we can support, someone we believe in, then we call up these people. We let them know this candidate is going to be at such a place at such and such a time and you can come and meet him. You can talk to him if you like him. And if you believe what he says, then, fight for him. Then, you can work for him and actually get this person elected. And we had 320 people out of 400 people in my hometown sign up for that list. If we can do that on a national scale in Washington, D.C. with tens of hundreds of thousands of people, imagine what 's going to happen if we can get that many people behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative or in this matter, just a constitutional candidate. G. @!BECK : So when is it? P. @!BECK : It 's July 4th. It 's going to occur at the U.S. Capitol building. We 're actually going to start at McPherson Square which is a little north of the White House. And we 're going to, quote, unquote, march down to the Capitol building. We 're going to have several speakers and an opportunity for people to get together, figure out what 's wrong, get them motivated and then get them organized so we can actually get people in place to get things done. G. @!BECK : What did you think of the last lady we had on, Nancy Armstrong? P. @!BECK : I think she is fantastic. She is welcome at our event, too. G. @!BECK : Yes. P. @!BECK : That 's a thing that a lot of people do n't get. This is n't a party thing. I have voted Republican in the past. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he is from my state. G. @!BECK : Right. I do n't know about anybody else. I mean, my family has voted Democrat for years. I really do n't care - whoever has the right idea, whoever will put the country first and will put fiscal responsibility first. This is just madness. P. @!BECK : Yes. G. @!BECK : Anybody who does that, I do n't care what party you are from. I really do n't. All right. We appreciate it, Patrick. Thank you so much and best of luck. We 'll be right back in a minute.
