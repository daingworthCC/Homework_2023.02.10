221341 REMOTE VIEWING @(Distorted-footage-) @!HAROLD-DOW-reporti : @(Voiceover) Is there really such a thing as extrasensory perception, communicating with only a psychic connection or seeing events thousands of miles away? And if ESP does exist, how can we prove it? @!Ms-MARILYN-SCHLITZ : We 're going to ask do you have a seat right here. @(Footage-of-Schlitz) @!DOW : @(Voiceover) Today, in this California lab, researcher Marilyn Schlitz will try to capture an actual ESP moment. @!Ms-SCHLITZ : Three, two, one, relax, relax. What we 're testing is that some kind of extrasensory communication can occur between two people even at a distance. @(Footage-of-researc) @!DOW : @(Voiceover) In one room, a researcher watches an old movie clip. In this case, it 's a scene of a tidal wave striking an ancient city. The researcher then tries to transmit a psychic image of what she sees. In another room, the isolated subject is trying to open her mind to the psychic message. Will it work? @!Ms-SCHLITZ : Anything that goes through her head is what we 're trying to just record right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classical musician for a subject because, for some reason, musicians seem to have a greater capacity for what may be ESP. Unidentified Woman :( In isolated room) A person wearing a cape. @(Footage-from-movie) @!DOW : @(Voiceover) The subject begins to describe her perceptions. Unidentified Woman : Bricks falling, pushing to get out, stepped on. @(Footage-of-woman) @!DOW : @(Voiceover) Remember, she ca n't see or hear the movie clip. She can only visualize what the researcher is transmitting psychically. @!Ms-SCHLITZ : Ready? You 're going to see the target now. @(Footage-of-compute) @!DOW : @(Voiceover) It appears to have worked. @!Ms-SCHLITZ : Oh, thank goodness. You are good, my friend. You are good. @(Footage-of-study-p) @!DOW : A controlled experiment is one thing. It 's when you get out of the lab and see its potential uses that ESP really gets interesting. Author and physicist Russell Targ does n't have perfect eyesight, but he says there are other ways of seeing. @!Mr-RUSSELL-TARG-@1 : Remote viewing is an ability that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on at a distant place. @(Distorted-footage-) @!DOW : @(Voiceover) Sound crazy? The CIA did n't think so. Back in the early 1970s it hired Targ to help create a psychic spy program, and for the next 20 years various government agencies spent millions of dollars tracking the Soviets, terrorists, drug dealers and hostages using only ESP. @!Mr-TARG : A number of people supported our work : NASA, the Navy, the Army, the Air Force, Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency. @(Footage-of-ESP-boo) @!DOW : @(Voiceover) Only officials would n't call it ESP. They preferred the term remote viewing. @!DAN-RATHER-@1Ancho :( From 1981) Italian terrorists have kidnapped American Brigadier General James L. Dozier. @(Footage-of-newspap) @!DOW : @(Voiceover) In 1981, remote viewers were put to the test and told to find General Dozier. @!Mr-JOE-McMONEAGLE- : Essentially, they had some hours ' head start on the police department. @!DOW : @(Voiceover) Led by a government agent named Joe McMoneagle... @(Footage-of-police-) @!Mr-McMONEAGLE : @(Voiceover) And wanted to know where he was being held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!Mr-McMONEAGLE : I named the city. I drew a street map that was about as accurate as you could get. @!Mr-TARG : Joe was, far and away, the most talented of that whole group. @!Mr-McMONEAGLE : I gave them descriptions of how he was being held. @!Mr-TARG : And, also, he set a benchmark for how good psychic abilities could be. @!Mr-McMONEAGLE : He was in that right city. He was at that location in that city. And the description of the building fit. qwq @( Photo-of-Dozier ; -m @!DOW : @(Voiceover) Dozier was safely rescued before McMoneagle 's information was put to use, but the remote viewing community considered his performance a big success. The program continued for 15 years before Congress got skeptical. Professor RAY HYMAN( University of Oregon) : We could n't track any of this down. @(Footage-of-Hyman) @!DOW : @(Voiceover) In 1995, Professor Ray Hyman of the University of Oregon was commissioned to study the remote viewing program. So you remain skeptical @!Prof-HYMAN : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this whole process... @!Prof-HYMAN : Oh, yeah, I... @!DOW :... of remote viewing? @!Prof-HYMAN : Yeah, and even these stories -- I remain skeptical about the stories. I 'm not sure they happened. qwq @( Footage-of-Hyman ; - @!DOW : @(Voiceover) Based on Hyman 's report, Congress killed the remote viewing program. @!Mr-McMONEAGLE : I also get objects moving from the -- one to the other, too. @(Footage-of-McMonea) @!DOW : @(Voiceover) But that has n't put Joe McMoneagle out of business. He runs his own private consulting business now, sort of a psychic for hire. He agreed to let 48 HOURS put him to the test to see if he could use his ESP to find me. What are we doing? Unidentified Man : Here you go, bud. @!DOW : This is a secret. Niagara Falls. qwq @( Footage-of-Niagara Unidentified Boy 1 : This is cool. @!DOW : It 's 2:00. I 'm standing in front of Niagara Falls. And at this very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in North Carolina. From the beginning he said he did n't want to know where I was going. And, in fact, he did n't even want to know my name. Now he says if I concentrate, he can find me. Let 's see. @!Mr-McMONEAGLE : It 's very strange. This structure 's very, very strange. I get a momentary impression of people standing in front of a row of windows. @(Footage-of-ferry) @!Mr-McMONEAGLE : @(Voiceover) I think they 're just open frames, but there 's no glass in them. The windows are unique in that they have curved corners. I get a very distinctive elongated platform. It 's like a -- some kind of a raised thing that you walk down. @(Footage-of-tourist) @!Mr-McMONEAGLE : And people -- a lot of people. They 're getting on and off the metal structure. I 'm having like this really great overlay, you know, which is the ferry. qwq @( Footage-of-ferry ; - @!Mr-McMONEAGLE : @(Voiceover) Large open area. There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrate, he can find me. @!Mr-McMONEAGLE : I think there 's a whole lot of stuff here. It 's all very congested. It 's all interrelated in some way. @(Footage-of-McMonea) @!DOW : @(Voiceover) McMoneagle did pick up a lot of images that seemed to match what we saw at Niagara Falls, but he missed the main event. Unidentified Boy 2 : That 's Niagara Falls. @(Footage-of-waterfa) @!DOW : @(Voiceover)... the waterfalls. @!Mr-McMONEAGLE : Oh, that 's interesting. @(Footage-of-McMonea) @!DOW : @(Voiceover) So a week later we visited to find out what went wrong. At one point I know I was feeling that you had missed it totally because I 'm saying, ' OK, Niagara Falls. You either got Niagara Falls or you do n't. ' Why do you suppose you missed that? @!Mr-McMONEAGLE : I guess anybody that knows me knows I do n't get waterfalls. @!DOW : You -- you -- you do n't get waterfalls? @!Mr-McMONEAGLE : I never get waterfalls. @(Footage-of-waterfa) @!DOW : @(Voiceover) Joe may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I 've got two objects in my pockets, one in this one and one in this pocket. @(Footage-of-McMonea) @!DOW : @(Voiceover) So, at the last moment, we decided to give him one last shot. @!Mr-McMONEAGLE : One 's plastic, one 's metal, I think. @!DOW : Shall we take a look? Let 's see. I do n't know. Sometimes I think you can see through doors. I do n't know if you saw this or not. That 's pretty good. That 's pretty good. @(Footage-of-people-) @!RATHER : @(Voiceover) Next... @!Dr-BRIAN-WEISS-@1P : @(Voiceover) Go back before you were born. @(Footage-of-Weiss) @!RATHER : @(Voiceover)... this Yale-educated doctor says your fears and phobias may have begun in a past life. @!Ms-TERRY-WACHTEL : I was a healer. @(Footage-of-Terry) @!RATHER : @(Voiceover) He says he 's taking Terry back 2,000 years... @!Ms-WACHTEL : I was a man. @!RATHER : @(Voiceover)... to cure her. @!Dr-WEISS : It works. @!Ms-WACHTEL : I was shocked. @(Footage-of-48-HOUR) @!RATHER : @(Voiceover) Coming up @ @
