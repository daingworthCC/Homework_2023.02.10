231641 HOST : Rush Limbaugh @!EXECUTIVE-PRODUCER : Roger Ailes @(Theme-music) qwq @( Graphic-shown-on-s WARNING The views expressed on this program are not necessarily the views of the staff, advertisers or your local station... @!BUT-THEY-OUGHT-TO-# RUSH @!LIMBAUGH : And here we are all set and ready to go for more broadcast excellence on TV, the RUSH @!LIMBAUGH television show. Hey, guess what.( Whispering) We have a liberal in the audience tonight. @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : Yes, we do. It does n't happen much, but one has snuck in here. And I spotted -- I 'm not going to tell you what sex, but as I came in, I always warm up the audience. I say hello and I look at them, and I spotted this person even before I asked if there were any liberals in the audience. And I 'm sure during the course of the program, when we pan the audience, you probably will be able to spot this liberal, too. @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : Now let us show you what we have for you on our marvelous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' show tonight. @(Bill-Clinton-frown) @!LIMBAUGH : It seems like -- we 're sitting in our production meeting today, and I said, Can we do something besides Clinton. It seems like every night we 're talking about Clinton. ' And they said, Hey, it 's news, ' and that 's right. We talk about the hot news of the day on this show, whatever it is. And there is -- there is a story... @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : Hey, no hissing. That 's what they do at liberal shows, you know? Do n't hiss. Do n't hiss. That just makes me think snakes are in the -- Bill Clinton has admitted something that everybody knew before the election. But now that the election 's come and gone, the truth can come out and it does n't really matter, because what can we do about it? I 'll tell you what it is as the program unfolds. @(Magic-Johnson-pict) @!LIMBAUGH : More on Magic Johnson tonight. Now we have -- I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have been too harsh on Magic. We 've been a little bit too critical of him. Tonight we are going to show you a clip from a news conference where he says, You know, I 'm saying some things out there to kids that they 're cutting out of my interview. ' And he 's right. I 've heard him say what you do n't hear him say much on these interviews. We 'll show you that and also share with you some questionable logic about Magic and AIDS and the NBA and the USA Today editorial today. @(Photo-of-people-ou) @!LIMBAUGH : Also, folks, this is the one thing in New York City in the last 35 or 40 years that worked -- a pay toilet. It absolutely worked. And because it worked, they have removed them from the streets. @(Laughter) @(Question-mark-pict) @!LIMBAUGH : And, of course, here we have our fourth monitor, the giant question mark. What 's there? Who knows? If we get to it, you, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to welcome back to our program this week my chief of staff, Kit Carson, who is just back from a week in Barba -- ah, looky there ; there he is. He 's back from a week 's honeymoon in Barbados -- Barbados. He got married about a week ago. And it was -- I was there. It was -- it was a great wedding. And I 'll tell you, she is very lucky. She is a profoundly lucky girl. He never took his eyes off her at the wedding. Most guys at the wedding are looking straight ahead, and you can imagine what 's in their minds( mumbles), but he never. He was looking over her -- never took his eyes off her. @(Kit-Carson-is-show) @!LIMBAUGH : And when -- when they were pronounced man and wife, he stood up and kind of went, Yeah! Yeah! ' as though he could n't believe he got her. But he did, and so we would like to wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world and hope that... @(Applause) @!LIMBAUGH :... really -- really -- really hope that you both end up redefining the happy marriage. Now to show you, though, what marriage does, just today I said, Hey, Kit, who 's on Monday night football tonight? ' And he said, I do n't know. ' Last week if I would have asked him who 's on Monday night football, bam, bam, just like that. And then I would have found out who the Knicks are playing, who the Rangers are playing, who the Milwaukee Bucks are playing, the Minnesota North Stars. He does n't know who 's on Monday night football. You know why? Because he ca n't watch it anymore. He 's married, and he 'll probably have to get the socks out of the dryer tonight while he 's watching Part Two of " Sinatra " or whatever else his wife wants to see. Is n't marriage wonderful? We 'll be back with our program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @(Theme-music) @(Announcements) @(Theme-music) @!LIMBAUGH : And welcome back to our -- I just love it when they do that. They say, You 're in the bumper shot in camera three to give Jill something to do, ' just kind of glides over and I follow it. And I anticipate when they 're going to move to this camera, which is ca -- camera two. I do it flawlessly every time just as -- just as I just did it. Hey, how many of you were watching the news over the weekend and saw this? Roll that in, Turner. @(Footage-shown-of-C) @!LIMBAUGH :( Voiceover) There he is, our president-elect, out playing golf. He -- he teaches women to play golf. He starts out, yeah, with the irons and works his way into the woods with them. @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : And -- did you -- did you notice that cigar in his mouth? It looked like a Cuban cigar to me. And I -- I... @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : Probably a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to make a downpayment on your night in the Lincoln bedroom, and that may be it. Now I w -- I was wondering if he inhaled. No, he did n't light it up. He just walked around with it sticking out of his mouth -- anything to improve your appearance. My friends, as you know, we have to on occasion -- we do on occasion play for you a Clinton sound-alike. And w -- what happened was a guy called my radio show one day, and I, because of my unique special keen ears and talent combined, recognized this man as one who sounds just like Governor Clinton. So I said, you know, say some things. Say this, brrrtt. He said it. And I said say that, brrmm. And he said it. And we ended up with a bunch of things that I think Governor Clinton could have said and been closer to the truth in the campaign than what he did say. @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, we have to do a disclaimer to let you know that it 's not really the person. So I would like -- you know, how on -- on Monday night football and sportcasts, they -- they love to read this -- whatever they call it -- the disclaimer that you do n't have no rights to rebroadcast this show, da-da-da-da. Well, we have to do a disclaimer on this stuff, and I would like to do that live for you right now before we play this piece. Leave no question that it 's really not Governor Clinton, just somebody that sounds like him. Here 's -- and we have also -- after I do this, we will then put this disclaimer up on the screen for you to see so that those of you watching this show with -- with perhaps some horrible hearing will be able to see, nevertheless, the disclaimer. So here we go. Celebrity voices on the RUSH @!LIMBAUGH show are not necessarily the people speaking. @(Laughter) @(The-disclaimer-is-) @!LIMBAUGH : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Here is -- that 's right. That -- what? You did n't -- you did n't understand it the first -- OK. They said that they did n't understand me the first time. I 'll do it again one more -- it wo n't take up much time, because we 've got to get on with the hot news here. Celebrity voices heard on the RUSH @!LIMBAUGH are not necessarily the people speaking. Thank you. Here is our celebrity voice. qwq @( Photo-shown-of-Bil Unidentified Man 1( Clinton Sound-Alike) :( Voiceover) I just do n't have any idea what my policies are going to do. I just want to be president. @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : Now -- now, folks, let me show you a headline in today 's New York Times. Now we 're swerving into serious. We 've had our jocularity. We 've had our fun. We 've been light-hearted. Take a look at this -- this is from today 's New York Times -- headline. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes, tries to lower expectations. ' Democrats are finding perils in the politics of hope. ' The president-elect tries to see what can really be achieved. ' Wait just a minute. Can I ask anybody in the audience what -- show the headline back up there, Turner. I want to see that top headline. @(Headline-shown) @!LIMBAUGH :( Voiceover) Why do you think that you folks are going to have to lower your expectations? Anybody want to take a stab at... See, they 're in awe of me, ladies and gentlemen. @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : They 're sitting there. They 're waiting for me to provide the answer. It happens every time -- tried to involve them. I 'll tell you why they 're lowering expectations. It 's real simple, folks. The welfare system -- the welfare state is over. Now Governor Clinton, in order to win and with the willing participation of the media, presented this scenario of an economy about ready to collapse, and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all these years. And what was the solution? Why, we 're going to have health care. We 're going to get started on that in 100 days, and then we 're going to have a job for everybody. We 're going to reform welfare. And everybody 's going to get a student loan. Why, it 's going to be a beautiful thing. It 's going to be marvelous. @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : But now all of a sudden, wait a minute, I 've -- and I predicted this to you last week. The only thing left out of this story is, What we have found is so bad, so deeply rooted -- the Reagan-Bush problems are so deeply rooted that we ca n't get to our plans immediately. We 've got to fix these things first, and it 's going to require us to do things differently than what we said we were going to do. ' The simple fact of the matter is is that they did create a bunch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which ca n't work. I 'm going to tell you a dirty little secret. The welfare state 's been tried and can not be implemented again, because it does n't work. We are in debt up to our ears not because the foreign countries that we defend are not paying us their share of defense. We 're not up in -- in all this debt because our defense budget is so high. We are in debt because we have continued to pay an increasing number of people in this country not to work. It 's just that simple. And every year, it seems, we have expanded the rolls. If you doubt me, go back to ' 64 ; when we started, we spent $ 3 trillion on the problems of the socially indigent and so forth and it has n't worked. And Governor Clinton knows this. He got elected building you up for a government solution for everything, knowing that it 's not possible. The only way this economy is coming back is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, your friends, anybody else being confident enough in the future to go out and borrow money or to get investors to invest in your project or whatever and taking a risk, putting it to work, growing a business, investing in a business, or whatever. And I -- I think that you ought to take this headline to heart. You ought not raise your expectations as to the government. What you ought to do is raise your expectations about yourself. Put a little -- a few more demands on yourself and do n't depend on these magical fixes that are never going to happen anyway. You 'll do much better succeeding on your own than waiting around for whatever dribbles out of Washington. Now one other thing about this, over the weekend on CNN 's " Evans and Novak, " Senator Moynihan, Democrat from New York... @(Photo-shown-of-Sen) @!LIMBAUGH :... came out with one of the most amazing proposals right out of the George Bush campaign. Take a look. qwq @( Footage-of-Moyniha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Yes, I think we 're going to tick up on that over $ 100,000 class, which -- and there 's money there. There 's a lot more money than there was 15 years ago. And I think taking the capital gains down from 28, which it is now, which is not quite but it 's sort of towards the top of the income tax breaks, take it down to 15, call it a deal and get governing. I mean, let 's st -- stop fussing about taxing and -- and spending. Let 's govern. @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : Did you hear that? Why, it 's a capital gains tax cut. I thought that would only benefit the rich, ladies and gentlemen. Yes, and here 's a Democrat saying, Hey, let 's go ahead and do it. We 'll trade it off for a tax on people making over $ 100,000 -- that 's -- I thought it used to be $ 200,000, but why quibble -- a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there you have it, folks. Capital gains tax is exactly what is needed, but they could n't get elected saying so, because their constituents think that that only helps the rich. I tried to tell you upfront and long before the election, and the media knew all of this, too. It 's amazing how things change after the election when the truth ca n't hurt you anymore. Well, there 's more. There 's Magic Johnson on the other side of our break and a whole lot of other exciting things, and we 'll get to that right after this. Do n't go away. qwq @( Applause-and-theme @(Announcements) @!LIMBAUGH : Got to throw something away here, folks, before we can continue with the show. And I thought that I would show you how this happens on RUSH @!LIMBAUGH, the TV show. Purposely our liberal receptacle, the trash can, is right over there to my left, as you can see. And I -- I make sure that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is fun. I 'll see if I can do it, as I normally -- normally do. Are we -- are we ready? Here goes. @(Rush-throws-a-crum) @!LIMBAUGH : Oh! Geez, a little bit to far. But, as you can see, I -- I banked that off the wall purposely because liberals never shoot straight. @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : You have to -- have to do that. All right. Magic Johnson has -- I think he 's got a legitimate beef. While Magic has been portrayed by some as not worthy of hero status -- and I agree with that -- and while people have been critical of Magic, he has said some accurate things in terms of the advice he 's giving kids as to what they should not do to remain free from the risk of AIDS. Here is a little snippet of a press conference he held recently about this. Take a look. @(Footage-of-Johnson) @!Mr-EARVIN- " MAGIC " - : What I wanted them to do -- that if they ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them at the end of the program again to abstain from having sex -- but if they have an urge or if they want to do it, they should consult their parents, talk to them. And, like I said, it 's a shame that -- that part did n't come out, because I said it in every interview, but, like I said, they had to cut something out. @!LIMBAUGH : All right. So it 's played now on this show, one of the most watched late-night television shows in America. And I 'm not lying about that. Thank you all, by the way, out there for making that actually true. But I wonder if Magic put those recommendations or that suggest -- suggestion in his list of recommendations to the presidential AIDS commission. I 've heard him say abstinence a couple of times, but I wonder -- wonder how serious about it he really is. Now in the USA Today, there 's an editorial today about Magic Johnson and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the NBA because fellow players do n't want to play with him. They do n't want to run the risk of acquiring the virus. And here 's what USA Today says about this. qwq @( A-photo-of-Magic-J The Editorial Page USA Today Friday 11/6/92 Johnson 's retirement need not be a tragedy, but a constant reminder of what happens when fear overrides the facts. @!LIMBAUGH :( Voiceover) Johnson 's retirement need not be a tragedy but a constant reminder of what happens when fear overrides the facts. ' qwq @( A-photo-of-Magic-J The Editorial Page USA Today Friday 11/6/92 Overcoming fear &amp; ignorance are tough plays for even a star like Magic Johnson to make. Yet, with a lot of practice and hard work, maybe the truth about AIDS will win out in the end. @!LIMBAUGH :( Voiceover) Overcoming the fear and ignorance are tough plays even for a star like Magic Johnson to make. Yet, with a lot of practice and hard work, maybe the truth about AIDS will win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorial, they claimed that of the estimated 250,000 AIDS cases, not a single infection has been attributed to sports competition. You know what bothers me about this? Magic played an exhibition game recently. He cut his arm. He even said in an interview, That made me stop and think. ' I mean, that 's how you transmit this virus -- through the exchange of body fluids. And the NBA players are saying, I do n't want to run the risk of getting this disease, because if I get it, there 's no cure. ' Remember how many people said, Do n't worry about going to your dentist. Ah, the risk is so small. ' But then there was Kimberly Bergalis. And that little tiny, infinitesimal risk killed her. And the NBA players or anybody else -- why is it, folks -- why is it that when you wish to avoid contracting this disease, they say you 're ignorant and they say that you 're perpetuating fear. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just -- it makes no sense to me about this disease. It 's as though if you do n't want to get it, you are a bigot. You 're discriminating against somebody. I ca n't blame these NBA players. And in his heart, Magic Johnson ca n't either and does n't. That 's why he quit. Now about this business of no known cases of transmission in sports contact, not necessarily the case. We have a call -- Sandy in Phoenix, Arizona, you say that you know of a case of AIDS transmission or you 've read of one in sports competition? @!SANDY-@1Caller@2 : Hi, Rush. @!LIMBAUGH : Hi. @!SANDY : Well, there 's one reported in the British journal of medicine called the Lancet... @!LIMBAUGH : Yeah. @!SANDY :... May 5th, 1990, Page 1105, and this case has to do with a 25-year-old Italian soccer player. And they were playing a team from a drug rehab center, and the other guy that he ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy had tested previously for HIV. @!LIMBAUGH : Ended up getting it. @!SANDY : And two months later, this kid has it. And that 's documented, and I -- I do n't understand why USA Today said categorically that there 's never been a documented case, because that case is very well documented. @!LIMBAUGH : Well, that 's a good point. I had n't heard about that case, no -- but I 'm -- I 'm certain that it 's possible. See, that 's the thing. They talk about the risk as though it 's such a small risk, it 's so infinitesimal, but it 's a risk that can kill. And it is not ignorant to want to avoid the risk -- is the only point. And we have to go. We 're out of time for this segment. Look, Sandy, thanks very much for the call. I appreciate you taking time to get through. We 'll be back with more right after this. Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOUR RUSH VIDEO TO... THE RUSH @!LIMBAUGH SHOW 515 W. 57 St. New York, NY 10019 @(Theme-music) @!LIMBAUGH : All right, folks. Take a look at this videotape. Four months ago, a number of these little toilets... @(Footage-shown-of-p) @!LIMBAUGH :( Voiceover) Actually, they 're not little -- they 're pretty large -- imported from France were installed along the streets of New York City. Over 40,000 people used these toilets. Now they worked -- 40,000 people. There was no grafitti. There was no vandalism, not even a single mugging during four months of toilet usage on the streets of New York. You ca n't say that about any other activity on the streets of New York. @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : Two thousand people wrote in praise of the program, so the city has taken the toilets out. They work. And to put them back in, here 's what you have to do in New York City. You need a legislative waiver from the state. Then you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them. Then you have to go through a public site selection process. Then the city art commission -- the art commission has to approve the design of a toilet. 1994 is the soonest these toilets can be back in. There you have a perfect example of liberal bureaucracy. The people want it, the people need it, the people used it, the people loved it. That 's not good. We 're going to go back to stinky, smelly streets in New York. ' It 's just a classic example of how liberalism goes, and that 's the case. @!OK-folks-watch-t# qwq @( Footage-of-Grand-R Unidentified Man 1 : Right now it 's time to reveal the winner of TV-13 Great Late Debate.
