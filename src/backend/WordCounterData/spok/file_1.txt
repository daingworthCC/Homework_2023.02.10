17141 ERIC @!BURNS, FOX NEWS HOST : On this week 's " FOX News Watch " : The president and the hurricane : will he weather the storm? The media helping victims to weather the storm. How did the media judge the judge? How did audiences judge Martha on her return to TV? And everybody has to go to the bathroom sometime. We will cover the coverage of these stories right after the headlines. @(NEWSBREAK) @!BURNS : You 've heard of slow times in the news business? The past few weeks have been as fast as they get. So we had better get started. Here are Jim Pinkerton of " Newsday ", syndicated columnist Cal Thomas, Jane Hall of the American University, and media writer Neal Gabler. I 'm Eric Burns. " FOX News Watch " is coming right up. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!GEORGE-W-BUSH-PRE : Americans have every right to expect a more effective response in a time of emergency. When the federal government fails to meet such an obligation, I as president am responsible for the problem. And for the solution. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katrina Thursday night. Jane, a lot of the criticism about the media politicizing this storm. But when the president of the United States apologizes himself, are the media thereby absolved from criticism about politicizing? @!JANE-HALL-AMERICA : You know, that 's an interesting question. I think given that Bush has been portrayed as being reluctant to remember when he had a mistake, when he first said this at a press conference in response to a reporter 's question, when he said it again, a lot of people - I 'm sure his own advisers - were telling him that the country - the mood of the country was that he should take responsibility. I do n't think that 's politicizing. I would fault the media in the commentary beforehand. If I heard one more person say, We 're going to have a bullhorn moment - referring to the apparently spontaneous moment down with the firemen in 9/11 -- I thought that was cynical and uncalled for. Let the guy have his speech. Do n't talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a problem with the criticism at all. I think that the administration on this issue had a tin ear. He - politically, they made some very bad decisions. But there 's also, as Neal is found of saying - and I think he 's absolutely right on this - there is a template in this coverage. And one of the templates - and there were many on this particular issue - is that only big government is good. And so if big government has failed, as it clearly did at some level in this, then the media jump right on - what we really need is more money, and more big government. I find that to be inconsistent. @!JIM-PINKERTON- " NE : Right. The further paradox is it 's - the big government is good, but of course the federal government under Bush is terrible. So we have to - we have to replace the current proprietor of the federal government, Bush, with somebody better. That 's what they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are state and local governments to a substantial measure. And, of course, the local populous, which continues to get it - to find itself whining all the time on TV - to get more federal money. @(CROSSTALK) @!NEAL-GABLER-MEDIA : There 's so many ulterior motives going on. @!BURNS : Well I was just going to say - let 's find out if there are more templates. We 'll go to the master. @!GABLER : Yes, actually, there is a template here. It was very interesting -- the fall guy in this, and the best story out of this, was that Michael Brown was a complete moron. You know, there was - they - he should n't been in the position in the first place. @!BURNS : This is how the media portrayed him. @!GABLER : Exactly. This is how the media portrayed him. And in point of fact, this is how the administration portrayed him as well. Now, Knight-Ridder issues a report this week that indicates that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one who should have taken command. That, in fact, he did n't hand off the baton to Brown until three days later. Now, Chertoff is a former judge. Chertoff seems to be respectable, he 's clearly intelligent. It 's a bad story to say that Chertoff is the guy responsible. It 's a much better story to say that an idiot like Brown is responsible. @!BURNS : So the media are sticking with that story? @!PINKERTON : Well, they 're fascinated by this. And of course, when a guy with a beard goes after another guy with a beard, you know. @(LAUGHTER) @!PINKERTON :. something huge is going on. It 's Gabler versus Chertoff. But, look, without taking anything away from the terrible tragedy that occurred in New Orleans, we - just moving to where we are in the media coverage of this, this is now a -- completely a gift that 's going to keep giving for years - all these commissions, all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell who, is going to be fodder for reporters for years to come. @(CROSSTALK) @!BURNS : But Jim, it 's not. @!GABLER : Well, it may not be, because - look it, one of the stories - there are many stories that were n't covered this week. One of the stories that was n't covered this week is that over 70 percent of the American people want an independent commission. The Republicans, on a straight party line, voted down an independent commission on Katrina. Barely - that story was barely covered. That 's one of many stories that were n't covered. No-bid contracts. @!BURNS : Jim refers - Jim refers to the story - this story will keep on giving. Jane, there 's a way in which it 's giving negatively, and that is coverage abroad, where the United States, which was getting savaged in some countries for what it 's doing in Iraq, is getting savaged all the more. " The Economist, " a very highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America. " And the foreign press is seizing upon this, and I think in terms of future diplomatic efforts in all kinds of venues, what the foreign press is now doing is going to have really serious ramifications. @!HALL : You know, I agree with you. I was fairly shocked - and I think it was designed to shock - by the cover of a - of a young African-American child, and then the headline, " The Shaming of America. " I think a lot of people, frankly, were indulging - a lot of international coverage was indulging in the idea of, Well, we 're the biggest superpower, we think we can help everybody, we ca n't help our own people. That script, I think, and the idea that we have a third world - I saw that in a lot of international coverage right in our backyard. @(CROSSTALK) @!THOMAS : The foreign media played the same racism game as the domestic media. Here 's another template for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was when Ted Koppel, who as - who as anchoring the president 's speech, when to Dean Reynolds in the parking lot of the Houston Astrodome. He had assembled 10 African-American evacuees from New Orleans. He asked each one of them what they thought of the Bush speech. Every one of them liked it, every one said they had faith in Bush, every one would not criticize. You could just see the sweat breaking out on his brow. What have I got here? So much for racism and anger against Bush. @!BURNS : You know, this is a hell of a time to admit it, but I do n't know exactly what a template is. Time for a break. @!GABLER :( INAUDIBLE) that segment? @!BURNS : Maybe I can look it up during the break, which we have to take now. When we come back : @!ANNOUNCER : Judge John Roberts was up for a grilling on Capitol Hill this week. But did some senators misuse the media limelight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " continues. @(COMMERCIAL-BREAK) @!END-#
