235841 ROBERT SIEGEL, Host : It now appears at least possible that there may be no National Hockey League season this year. The pro hockey season should have begun on October 1st, and it should have been a good one. A five year national television contract was set to begin with the Fox network. A labor dispute between the players and owners have kept the NHL off the ice, and the league is approaching the point where it may be too late to start the season. Both sides have warned that there may be no season at all. The non-hockey season follows this year 's strike shortened baseball season. And why labor strife has so marked professional sports this year and whether the prospects are for other sports to witness such strikes are questions we 're now going to pose to two sports journalists. Peter Gammens sp is an ESPN analyst and columnist for the Boston Globe. Welcome, Peter. PETER GAMMENS, Analyst, ESPN : Thank you @!SIEGEL And Steve Supe sp is a sports business media columnist at Newsday. Welcome to the program, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newsday ' : Thank you @!SIEGEL I 'd like to start with Peter Gammens, first of all, and ask you this. First of all, do you think there 's not going to be a hockey season, and is this essentially the same story as the baseball strike? Are they very similar issues? Mr. GAMMENS : Well, I do think there still will be a hockey season, as I do think there will be a baseball season, although I think that we 'll hear a lot more, ' Well, this is it. It 's all over. Nothing will work. ' But I think it 's different. There are similarities to baseball, but then there are a lot of dissimilarities to baseball because they 're very different businesses. What we 're seeing is owners are having so many problems controlling themselves because the essence- it 's very much a ' let 's buy whatever we can buy and sell it at a lot higher ' business. So they want to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll never allow owners to do. LINDA WERTHEIMER, Host : Steve Supe, you want to weigh in on this? Mr. SUPE : I think part of the problem, as Peter said, is among the ownership, new owners in both hockey and baseball. I think one of the things that 's holding up any type of baseball agreement is a rule that they passed, I guess it was back in July, which essentially said that eight of the 28 owners could hold up any agreement, which was different than in the past. Before, it was a simple majority @!SIEGEL Steve Supe, is there something fundamentally different about, say, on the one hand baseball and hockey, which have had strikes, and on the other hand pro football and basketball, or is just that this year was n't their turn to have a strike? Mr. SUPE : Well, let 's take football first. The NFL labor union, led by Gene Upshaw, managed to convince the ownership- the membership, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year, and now you 're seeing some of the ramifications of that with teams in the NFL in the preseason dropping some high salaried veterans, which is causing some consternation among the membership. The NBA, meanwhile, is facing some of those same problems. They have a salary cap as well. It 's a little softer cap, a more flexible cap. But the NBA at least had the good judgment to sort of put negotiations on hold and play the season. Play and talk at the same time, what a concept @!WERTHEIMER Well, now, let 's talk concepts here for a second. You 're talking about the technical reasons why the- why the teams and the owners are disagreeing, the players and the owners are disagreeing. But it seems- it seems just looking at it as a kind of a whole picture that something cosmic is happening here. There's- maybe this is related to the breakdown of family values or something that all of a sudden sports in America seems to just be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with games, and everybody 's mad at everybody. The fans are mad at both sides in all these disputes. Mr. GAMMENS : Well, I think that you may see a downsizing of fandom in the next few years. This whole thing has spun so out of control. Each sport has a different- has a different reason. I mean, in baseball, you have a long, long history of owner-player- really it 's gotten to the point of hatred. And the problem is there are about eight or 10 really hardline owners, some of whom have been just beaten to death by the players over the years, some of whom have come from the Wal-Marts and from waste management and things like that, have come in the last couple of years, who think that baseball unions should be the same as guys who drive beer trucks, which of course is completely different because here product and the union are one and the same. But there 's a- there 's a real feeling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they get it, will be a tremendous cost to the industry and I think would downsize the industry by a good 30 to 40 percent @!SIEGEL Steve Supe, I 'd just like to follow up that idea of downsizing with you for a moment. Expansion has been so much the theme of professional sports for the past couple of decades. Is it conceivable to you that over the next 10 years we could see leagues contracting? Mr. SUPE : I think it depends on the fallout from the baseball and hockey negotiations and the situation. But if you look at expansion prices for franchises in all the sports over recent years, they 've skyrocketed. Just the entrance fee for a baseball team to be considered is about $100 million. Cities are lining up to get franchises in almost every sport. The NFL is expanding internationally. The NBA has played games in Japan to start the season. There 's a lot of merchandising and television rights, money that 's going to be coming in internationally if, in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says. But the players want a piece of that action @!SIEGEL All this has wetted the players ' appetite for a bigger share, you 're saying. Mr. SUPE : That 's my belief. I mean, I think as in any labor management situation, when you believe there 's more, you 're generating more money as an industry. Well, the players are saying, ' We 're producing. Why do n't we get more of that- of the rewards? Why do n't we reap more of the rewards? We 're taking a lot of the risks. ' SIEGEL : Well, Steven Supe, thank you very much for talking with us today. And Peter Gammens, you, too. Mr. GAMMENS : Thank you very much @!SIEGEL Steven Supe is a columnist for New York Newsday, and Peter Gammens in an analyst with ESPN and a columnist at the Boston Globe @!WERTHEIMER Still to come this half hour, Hubble, Hubbell, toil, and trouble. Doggerel inspired by this morning 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @.
