246541 @!TRACY-SMITH-co-ho : Believe it or not, there are just three months until the first debate of the 2008 presidential campaign. A diverse field of presidential candidates and likely candidates is forming, but they 're all concerned with one dominant issue. @!JIM-AXELROD-co-ho : Yeah, and that 's the war in Iraq. So let 's talk about the war and its affect on the 2008 campaign with two savvy political observers, former Clinton White House press secretary Joe Lockhart and CBS News political consultant Nicolle Wallace who worked in the Bush administration. They join us from Washington. Good morning to you both. @!Ms-NICOLLE-WALLACE : Good morning. @!Mr-JOE-LOCKHART-@1 : Good morning. @!AXELROD : Nicolle, let 's start with you, and let 's start with John McCain. It would seem to me, if you take the premise that the speech this week from the president, by any measure, did n't move many people... @!Ms-WALLACE : Right. @!AXELROD :... and if the American public is, at best, uneasy about the policy of increasing troops to Iraq, John McCain, who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops, if not more troops even than the president has suggested, would seem to be in position to big -- be the big loser out of all this. Am I right with my read? @!Ms-WALLACE : Well, you know, we 'll see. I think one thing that has always dogged the White House when it comes to Iraq is, in addition to people feeling uncomfortable and weary of what is clearly a very difficult war, they have always been under the impression that there was no plan for Iraq. Now, I do n't think McCain will suffer from that label from the public. He obviously has a plan. I think people associate him with this strategy of having more troops, and we 're now going to see that. But I think McCain is doing exactly what his core supporters -- and that 's a pretty large number of Americans -- expect him to do, and that 's to put it all on the line, to say... @!AXELROD : Hang on. Hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chips fall where they may. ' @!AXELROD : Hang on for a just a second because what I 'm wondering is, if the policy becomes more unpopular every day and if McCain is the candidate linked to the policy, how 's that not a bad thing for him? @!Ms-WALLACE : Oh, it certainly is. Look, if Iraq does n't go well, if this troop surge results in a more dire situation in Iraq, I think -- McCain himself said so much this week in interviews, you know, everywhere, and in testimony, that he would rather win the war than win an election. And, you know -- but, look, they will privately and publicly, I think, make clear that Iraq is the whole enchilada there. @!SMITH : Nicolle, I want to bring Joe in here. Joe, let 's talk about the flip side. What if the surge actually works? Is McCain unstoppable at that point? @!Mr-LOCKHART : Well, John McCain will look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again, you know, he 's got -- he 's got -- using Nicolle 's term, he 's got all his chips in the middle of the table, as does the president. I do n't know that, though, if the -- if it does n't work, he 's hurt that much in the primary. I think his biggest problem is with the most conservative of Republicans ; those are the people who are still with the president. But, you know, once you get past the primary, if he gets to the general election, it 's very, very difficult. This is a deeply unpopular war, and I ca n't see, in 2008, with the situation on the ground as it is now, someone saying that they 're for it and they want more troops in there -- is going to be -- is going to be in very good standing. @!SMITH : Mm. @!AXELROD : Joe, as far as the Democrats go -- wondering how they begin to sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an artful manner? I mean, what 's the thought there about how you do this? @!Mr-LOCKHART : Well, I think the biggest thing that 's happened in the last couple of weeks is, for once and for all, Democrats have figured out that you can oppose the president, you can oppose the war and not have to worry about looking weak. And the way we got there was most of the Republican senators being so critical. I mean, Senator Hagel is the most critical person right now of the president in Washington, and he 's a Republican. But I think what Democrats have to do is walk that fine line between holding the president accountable, being opposition -- because that 's hugely important to Democratic activists -- but also not going to a place where you go too far, as far as defunding, and looking like you 're pulling tools away from the commander in chief while we 're at war. @!SMITH : Mm-hmm. And this is a tough issue. You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iraq right now. She originally voted for the war. Now, of course, she says she 's against the surge. @!Ms-WALLACE : Mm-hmm. @!SMITH : Are Republicans going to paint her as a flip-flopper? Is she going to get the Kerry treatment here? @!Ms-WALLACE : Well, I -- you know, look, I hope we 're beyond that point where, you know -- I hope that we are at a point in American politics where people are saying what they believe will make things better, and I think that what Republicans will do -- and you see John McCain, again, doing this... @!SMITH : Mm-hmm. @!Ms-WALLACE :... and, you know, most interesting, actually, the three major Republican... @!SMITH : Right. @!Ms-WALLACE :... primary candidates all embrace the president 's policy. @!SMITH : You know what, Nicolle? All right, Nicolle. Got to leave it there. Nicolle Wallace, Joe Lockhart, thanks so much to the both of you. @!Ms-WALLACE : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
