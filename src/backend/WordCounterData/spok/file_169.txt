4031141 @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# Whether it be caused by disease, aging or tragic accident, living life with radical hair loss can be crippling. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Everybody thinks that you have some evil agenda, that, are you part of a cult or are you with some biker gang or are you butch? @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# It can lead to isolation, depression, even death. That 's why we are so proud to introduce ProPelage Power, a revolutionary new hair care product that literally promotes hair growth overnight. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Off-camera) If you 've ever spent a late night in front of a TV, then you know an infomercial when you see one. But what if someone asked you to be in an infomercial and to make outrageous claims about a product you 've never used? Would you do it for the money and a chance to be on TV? @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) To find out, we decide to create our own infomercial. We take our cameras to one of the infomercial capitals of the world, Las Vegas. We place an ad in the local paper offering every day people $75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks of life. Of course, they did n't know that we made up everything. ProPelage does n't actually exist. The product, design, packaging, brochures, even the website, are all fake. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# Thanks to ProPelage Power. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) We also hire an actor, Paul Mattingly, to play a smarmy infomercial producer. And we cast Jesse, an actress, to pose as one of the participants. You 'll see why in a moment. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# The product we are endorsing today, ProPelage, is going to revolutionize hair care. It 's going to revolutionize the world, I think. Folks, I 've done hundreds of these infomercials, and I said, this is the first time that I 've really been convinced of a product 's true value. Folks are going to bed, spotty, balding hair. They apply the product in the evening, the next morning, there is full growth. @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# Wow. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# I know. And it 's, it 's outstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ran this experiment on five groups of people, 19 in all. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# So, I want you all to understand as well, we are making you the stars of this show. So, I 'm gon na have a couple of brochures here. If you wan na take... @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) We ask Paul to leave the room, giving our applicants time to read the fine print, which gets stranger and stranger. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A#... and we 'll be back soon to get one of you. All right? @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# ' Cause it 's got mostly natural stuff in it. @!PARTICIPANT-@1MALE# Until you get down to here with the ammonia, sodium methyl @(inaudible) or whatever the hell these other long words are. @!MIKE-@1PARTICIPANT# It 's got a lot of ammonia in it. @!TIM-@1PARTICIPANT@# How can it say 100% natural if it 's got EDTA and methyl chloride... @!PARTICIPANT-@1MALE# Look, carcinogens. It actually lists as carcinogens. @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# I do n't know if we 're supposed to... @!THERO-@1PARTICIPAN# It says cause temporary redness, rashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# Hair loss? @!THERO-@1PARTICIPAN# Hair loss. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) We 're watching everything from a nearby control room. Through a hidden ear piece, we tell Jesse, our actress, to put some of the product in her own hair. @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# Shine your healthy hair just by using an... @!JESSE-@1ACTRESS@2-# It says three times a day, you got to use it. @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# Really? Okay. @!JESSE-@1ACTRESS@2-# Yeah. It 's like really tingly. @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# Really? @!JESSE-@1ACTRESS@2-# Yeah. It 's almost like burning. Should I wash it out? It 's really, it 's really burning. @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# Really? Okay, you might wan na, like, go into the restroom. There 's a restroom down the hall. @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# Oh, my God. @!KELLY-@1PARTICIPAN# Oh, my God, her hair is falling out. @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# Oh, my gosh. @!PARTICIPANT-@1MALE# Wow. @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# Oh, my God. @!JESSE-@1ACTRESS@2-# That 's... @!KELLY-@1PARTICIPAN# You do n't have extensions in, do you? @!JESSE-@1ACTRESS@2-# No. @!KELLY-@1PARTICIPAN# What happened? @!JESSE-@1ACTRESS@2-# It really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# Yeah, I would. @!PARTICIPANT-@1MALE# Yeah. @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# Oh, my God. @!JESSE-@1ACTRESS@2-# Oh, my God. It 's, like, falling out of my head. I only put, like, like a little dab or something. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# @(Inaudible) go first? @!KELLY-@1PARTICIPAN# We 're having a little bit of an emergency here, Steve. @!JESSE-@1ACTRESS@2-# Just, just, like, like, like a dot of it and, like right here and... @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# Did you put it directly in your hair? @!JESSE-@1ACTRESS@2-#... and it 's like, it 's like burning still. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# Come with me. Come with me. Come with me. Did you put it directly in your hair? @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) You guessed it. That 's not her real hair that fell out, but the others do n't know that. It 's all part of our scheme to cast doubt on the safety of ProPelage. @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# Let 's not touch any of what 's in it. @!ROBERT-@1PARTICIPA# Let 's just face it. There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah. @!KELLY-@1PARTICIPAN# I thought her hair was literally, like, just coming out in globs. It was like, that was like @(inaudible). @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# Yeah. There 's hair on the floor. @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# Burn. It 's, like, it held it up to a flame. @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# Eww, eww, that 's not good. @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# And we 're gon na advocate this? @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# Oh, shoot. @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# $75. @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# Is n't that terrible? @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# Our names could be attached, our faces could be attached to this( censored by network). I think that I, endorsing a product that, her hair fell out in chunks. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Having seen all that, would anyone be willing to put themselves on the line and endorse our product? What would you do? @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# It was n't, it was n't the ProPelage. She 's got some kind of, I think, preexisting condition. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Despite whatever reservations any of our participants may have had, nobody leaves, as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, we look around to see what everyone else is doing, and we use that as information. We assume that they know something we do n't know. So, we trust what they 're doing more than we trust our own instincts. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# Are you ready? @!KELLY-@1PARTICIPAN# Yes. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# Let 's go. @!KELLY-@1PARTICIPAN# Rock and roll. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) They all head into the studio with Paul. Remember, no one in this group has hair loss or ever used ProPelage Power. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# I want you to use your own words here. I want you to make this your own. @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# There was a day where I was actually driving with me and a bunch of my friends. You know, we have the convertible top down, and unfortunately, a lot of my hair came out. @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# My scalp did n't heal correctly, so I was kind of bald in one spot. @!THERO-@1PARTICIPAN# When I first lost my hair, I was, I was devastated. @!ROBERT-@1PARTICIPA# The most heartbreaking time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# Just overnight, my hair grew back. @!ROBERT-@1PARTICIPA# And so, I used ProPelage Power on there, and it grew back, and I could n't believe it. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# Wonderful. Wonderful. Fantastic. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Excuse me, Robert. How are you? @!ROBERT-@1PARTICIPA# Hi. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Off-camera) I 'm John Quinones with ABC News, ' What Would You Do? " @!ROBERT-@1PARTICIPA# Well, how are you? @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Off-camera) We wanted to know how far will people go to sell a product, to get on television and, and get paid for it. @!ROBERT-@1PARTICIPA# Well, they would go very far. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Is there a point where you would have walked out and you said, ' No more, I ca n't say that. " @!ROBERT-@1PARTICIPA# No. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Off-camera) What if it hurt someone watching the show? What if they believe you and they go buy it and their hair falls out? @!ROBERT-@1PARTICIPA# That 's the liability of the people manufacturing it, and that 's why they have insurance. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their problem. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Off-camera) You 're just an actor. @!ROBERT-@1PARTICIPA# You 're just an actor. You have striptease dancers, they take off their clothes for money, right? @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# ProPelage rejuvenate, regenerate, and reinvigorate your hair. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Okay. Agreeing to lie about a product 's ability to grow hair is one thing, but what if the requests get more outrageous? @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# Tell me how the power of ProPelage is worth the risk of cancer. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) There must be a limit to how far people will go to sell ProPelage Power. @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# Well, you know what, it makes me feel better than a man in the middle of the night, I tell you. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Or maybe not.

But this? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hair 's not gon na fall out. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# I hope not. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# But will he do it? And later, what just happened on the beach to cause this? @!BILLY-@1BEACHGOER@# Come here. @!ERIC-@1ACTOR@2-# Whoa, whoa, whoa. @!BILLY-@1BEACHGOER@# Come here. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# When ' What Would You Do? " returns after this from our ABC stations. @!COMMERCIAL-BREAK-# @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) In Las Vegas, 19 people have turned up to perform in our fake infomercial for ProPelage Power. So far, all but one of the participants have agreed to go on camera and endorse a product they have never used. @!THERO-@1PARTICIPAN# Thanks to ProPelage, this is four days worth of growth. @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# Just overnight, my hair grew back. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) But what if the lies the producer asks for get bolder? At what point will people stop and refuse to go on? @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# Right to the camera, tell them, ' If you 're not completely satisfied with ProPelage Power, you get a money back guarantee. " All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied, there 's a 100% money back guarantee. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# Keep grabbing the product as you 're saying that. And we do not actually guarantee the product, but say it anyway. Say we 100% guarantee the product. @!DANA-@1PARTICIPANT# We 100% guarantee this product. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) And Dana was not the only one willing to hawk the nonexistent money back guarantee. @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# Money back guarantee. @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# You 'll have to excuse me for a second. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Though we did start to see some people refusing to continue. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# It 'll be fine, Tim. We need you, we need you to work through this. @!TIM-@1PARTICIPANT@# That 's all right. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# Please? @!TIM-@1PARTICIPANT@# No, no, that 's okay. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) And one person who left before recording anything. Most of the others kept going. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# I know we 're still waiting on FDA approval. We 've had some early testing incidents of cancer, and so... @!THERO-@1PARTICIPAN# Wait, wait, wait. Repeat that one again? @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing of the ProPelage product. @!THERO-@1PARTICIPAN# What do you mean by have cancer? @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# They have acquired cancer... @!THERO-@1PARTICIPAN# Oh, from the product. Okay. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A#... because of the product. So, something in the - we have a couple of carcinogens in there, but it 's in everything now. @!THERO-@1PARTICIPAN# Yeah, and actually, I read the, I read the thing. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# Yes. So, the warning is there. So, if we could somehow translate how it 's worth the risk, you know? @!THERO-@1PARTICIPAN# I got you. I got it. @!THERO-@1PARTICIPAN# When I first used ProPelage Power and I started doing research on it, I heard that there was a slight chance that you may, you know, acquire cancer from using it. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# One in three. One in three chance. @!THERO-@1PARTICIPAN# And for me, my life was already over. And that one in three chance, that was two in three of a chance to live and have my life back. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I would n't trade it, I would n't trade it again for, for anything. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# Fantastic. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Thero is not the only one willing to promote this carcinogenic product. That surprises us, but not our expert. @!AMY-CUDDY-@1ASSIST# If these people had known that when they came to work today, they 'd be asked to endorse a product that caused cancer, they probably would n't have shown up for work. But of course, they did n't know that. They came and they complied with a, with a small request, and gradually, the request got bigger and bigger and bigger until they 're at the point where they 're being asked to do something that 's pretty outrageous. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Professor Cuddy believes that many of us would have done exactly the same thing. But what if the requests get really personal? Will people risk harming themselves to sell ProPelage Power? Meet Mike, a punk rocker from way back. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# @(Makes-noise). @!MIKE-@1PARTICIPANT# @(Singing) If you 're losing your hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is fantastic. And if you could, what we like is get just a little action pour. Perfect. All right. Keep that little bit in your hand. It 's not burning, is it? @!MIKE-@1PARTICIPANT# No. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# Good. Now, if you could just take your hand and slick it through your hair into camera. If you can do both hands at once... @!MIKE-@1PARTICIPANT# Both hands at once? @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# That would be fantastic. @!MIKE-@1PARTICIPANT# My hair 's not gon na fall out? @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# I hope not. @!MIKE-@1PARTICIPANT# I hope not, too. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# Bad for the commercial. @!MIKE-@1PARTICIPANT# ProPelage. Rock on. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# Fantastic. You committed to it. That 's what I wanted to see. @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# I feel the power of ProPelage. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) We never thought they 'd put it into their own hair, but they sure did. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# Say, feel the ProPelage Power. @!THERO-@1PARTICIPAN# Feel the ProPelage Power. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# Last thing. We got a little sample right there in the cup. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sip, that 's all we need. It 's just to convince everyone that it 's not going to kill them. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Of course, it 's only a sports drink in the cup. @!MIKE-@1PARTICIPANT# Rock out with ProPelage. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) We 're stunned that all these people would drink ProPelage, even though it could be dangerous. @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# That is the taste of hair growing in my mouth. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# Wonderful. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Over two days of shooting, most of the participants willingly performed all of the tasks they were asked to. Experts say that 's because we 're hardwired to follow authority. Only four out of the 19 people found a line they would not cross. Meet Kelly. She was willing to go part of the way. @!KELLY-@1PARTICIPAN# My hair has come back twice as strong. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) But when Paul asks her to promote the nonexistent money back guarantee, things change. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# Now, we do n't actually have 100% money back guarantee, but we are saying it in the infomercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na go through or not. I was still... @!KELLY-@1PARTICIPAN# Oh, I see. So, it 'll be endorsed later, is that what you 're trying to say? @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# Maybe. @!KELLY-@1PARTICIPAN# Okay. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# We hope. It might not be, but if it 's not, we 're still gon na say it. @!KELLY-@1PARTICIPAN# What do you mean now? I mean, do n't you think that 's gon na, like, false advertising? Yeah, I honestly ca n't say that one. I, I can go to a certain point on this, but I honestly can not tell the customer and have myself be on television saying there 's a 100% money back guarantee when in fact there 's not. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) And then, there was Annette. @!ANNETTE-@1PARTICIP# Side effects, I do n't care. Just look at my luxurious hair. @!PAUL-MATTINGLY-@1A# To ProPelage and hair growth everywhere. @!ANNETTE-@1PARTICIP# To ProPelage and hair growth everywhere. @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# To ProPelage and hair growth everywhere. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) She enthusiastically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quinones. @!ANNETTE-@1PARTICIP# Hi. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Off-camera) And I 'm with ' What Would You Do? " @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) When I sat down and talked with her afterward, she had a moment of clarity. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Off-camera) You gave a testimonial on camera for something you really never used, right? @!ANNETTE-@1PARTICIP# Oh, it 's true. Yeah. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Off-camera) I mean, how do you explain it? @!ANNETTE-@1PARTICIP# Acting is something that I 've always, you know, wanted to do. And I did n't plan on doing anything immoral or wrong just to get there. And apparently, I did. @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# Yeah. @!ANNETTE-@1PARTICIP# So, I learned that I should n't, I should always trust my instincts and that I should n't go along or do things just because I 'm getting paid or just to achieve something I want. I mean, there 's more honest ways to go around it. There 's honest ways to make money. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) A lesson for us all. @!PARTICIPANT-@1FEMA# ProPelage power. @!THERO-@1PARTICIPAN# ProPelage power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a smack down on the beach. @!BILLY-@1BEACHGOER@# Come here. @!ERIC-@1ACTOR@2-# Whoa, whoa, whoa. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) But you wont believe what causes it. @!BILLY-@1BEACHGOER@# I 'll( censored by network) kill you, bro. @!JOHN-QUINONES-@1-A# @(Voiceover) When we come back.
