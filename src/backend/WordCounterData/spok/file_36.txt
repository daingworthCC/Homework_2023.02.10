225041 HARRY @!SMITH, co-host : Paris and fashion -- the words just go together, do n't they? Our Martha Teichner just got back to her home base in London after a look at the big spring fashion shows in Paris and she joins us this morning. You look great this morning, Martha, by the way. Good morning. @!MARTHA-TEICHNER-re : Oh, thank you, Harry. I thought I 'd let you know that grunge is dead. I thought you really needed to know that. @!SMITH : We know that this morning and I make -- I feel good about it. @!TEICHNER : Well, what 's in it 's place? This is really something. It 's a glimpse of the end of the century. The question is which century? Last season 's waifs have turned into damsels in distress -- innocent, romantic, vulnerable ; their soft, young flesh escaping from filmy, delicate, wispy garments. What are they doing dressed like that in the woods escaping from wolves? Here in this fantasy for British designer John Galliano, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexy. @!Ms-MARIN-HOPPER-@1 : It 's a strong statement. I mean, it... @!TEICHNER : Strong statement saying what? @!Ms-HOPPER : Saying, ' Come get me. Come -- come hither. ' No. I think... @!TEICHNER : Yes. @!Ms-HOPPER : I do n't know. I think that there 's a -- there 's -- there 's -- there 's really -- there 's something about skin. @!TEICHNER : Suddenly, Paris has a skin fetish. Skin -- it 's everywhere this spring. The lingerie look, skin peeking out suggesting all sorts of sexy, sensuous possibilities. Then there 's skinny, skin-tight and something called second skin. There 's skin pierced for the tribal look and tattooed. The body has become visible for the first time in years. It 's as if all those mountainous ' 80 shoulder pads suddenly started to melt into what is beginning to emerge as the shape of the ' 90s. @!Ms-SUZY-MENKES-@1I : Fashion now is like a Polaroid when the picture has n't quite come through. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're -- we 're getting the idea that everything is very fluid. This is really the story. Unidentified Designer : You know what I want. It 's like a military walk-through, huh. Unidentified Model : OK. Designer : To the end, like this. Like a soldier ; like an army, you know. @!TEICHNER : The story Karl Lagerfeld tells for spring is, well, weird. The judgment in Paris was that the hair may have been more interesting than the clothes in his Lagerfeld Signature Collection. But one of his other lines, Chanel, was the success story all the fashion writers were headlining -- young, flirty, colorful, humorous. The roller skates were gimmicky ; the bathing suits were something else, undoubtedly copied before they ever left the runway. If the ' 90s look is a Polaroid coming into focus, it is a snapshot of current London street fashion. Unidentified Female Shopper : God, look at the pockets inside. It 's incredible. Unidentified Clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, God! Clerk :... This is taken from the Scottish regiment. @!TEICHNER : Transforming working-class gear and flea-market fancy, British designers are back from oblivion, suddenly the hottest names around, like Galliano with his sleek little bias-cut numbers. His are the clothes the fashion insiders all wanted to take home. But it was Vivienne Westwood 's show they were raving about. Just when the rest of the world of high style was close to catching up with her, the ex-queen of punk has moved on to the bordello and she 's as outrageous as ever. The scene, one of those bad, old, turn-of-the-century hotels where tart is always on the menu and quivering tassels are there to tease. Where there 's a cheap candy box of a dress that 's all bow and bonbon. And you 've seen it all before, sort of, in the old movies late at night where every heroine has a past. Past but, in fact, you 're seeing the future there. You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the cutting edge. And, for example, in the last shot that you saw, you saw a filmy white dress with roses all over it. @!SMITH : Mm-hmm. @!TEICHNER : Those roses are going to find their way into every collection and department-store clothes in the next six months to a year. And the metallic stuff on the mantilla... @!SMITH : Right. @!TEICHNER :... metallic is very big and that 's why Vivienne Westwood is really the vanguard of what 's to come always because she makes statements that everybody else follows. You 're seeing her ideas in Valentino and you 're seeing her ideas in Lagerfeld that she did two and three years back. @!SMITH : Yeah, yeah. @!TEICHNER : Harry. @!SMITH : So the -- so the idea, then, is you look at these things, you go to these things and then there 's just one or two little ideas or Polaroids, as it were, that you take out of it and that 's what ends up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well, it 's -- it 's -- it 's more than that. It 's an evolution process. Last spring I showed you outfits that had three sleeves and sort of strange fabrics tacked together and no hems... @!SMITH : And I ended up buying one last -- just a week ago as a matter -- no, I 'm kidding. Go ahead. @!TEICHNER : Gee, and you did n't wear it on the morning news. @!SMITH : So... @!TEICHNER : And -- but, you know, what happens is these are sort of shocking ideas that evolve in time. That -- that kind of deconstruction idea... @!SMITH : Mm-hmm. @!TEICHNER :... where you take apart a garment. Now that 's translating into something soft. Where -- where, instead of squares and triangles, you 're seeing soft body lines. @!SMITH : Hm. @!TEICHNER : And it evolves out of time. They do n't do these things just sort of, bang. The Polaroid stays fuzzy for a while. @!SMITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing? @!TEICHNER : Skin -- skin is the thing. You notice I 'm not wearing any of those things : A. I 'd be arrested and, B. It 's cold here. I 'd freeze to death. @!SMITH : Well, and I 'm just wondering. Are people all over -- women all over the world going to hold gigantic bonfires to -- to destroy their shoulder pads? @!TEICHNER : If they want to see them melt. @!SMITH : I 'm melting away. Great story, Martha. Thank you so much. Great to see you. Giselle. @!GISELLE-FERNANDEZ- : OK. It 's 16 after the hour. Up next, Gene Siskel tackles " Rudy, " a film for people who love football and even people who do n't. And tomorrow on CBS THIS MORNING, money correspondent John Stehr on buying mutual funds at your neighborhood bank.
