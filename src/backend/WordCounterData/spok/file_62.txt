231241 Announcer : This is a presentation of News Channel 4. NEWS FORUM with Gabe Pressman. @!GABE-PRESSMAN-hos : For the last four years, he 's led the largest school system in the country : one million students, about 1,000 schools, hundreds of problems and crises that sometimes seem to occur on a daily basis. Among the issues Rudy Crew confronts as he tried to improve the system are : the agitation for school vouchers, deteriorating buildings, the need to end so-called social promotion, the pressing need to improve academic performance for the children. When the Board of Education voted to adopt his plan to end social promotion, Dr. Crew said, ' I think we are at a precipice, at the edge of something here that if it takes off and flies we 'll take a million children with us. If we do n't, then I can guarantee that we 'll see thousands of children who will graduate functionally illiterate, unable to compete in a world that is technologically driven. ' And Dr. Rudy Crew, the chancellor of New York City 's school system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning, Dr. Crew. @!Dr-RUDY-CREW-@1Cha : Good morning. How are you, Gabe? @!PRESSMAN : OK. How are you? @!Dr-CREW : Good. @!PRESSMAN : After you took over as chancellor of New York City 's schools in 1995, some wondered whether you were up to the job of handling the largest school system in the country. And you said, ' There is n't anything I 've dealt with here that I have n't dealt with in another school system. ' Has the job job been tougher than you expected? @!Dr-CREW : No, it 's been every measure of what I would have expected. There 've been some circumstances that I would n't have necessarily anticipated. But overall, the job has -- has been exactly what I anticipated it being. @!PRESSMAN : What were some of those circumstances that you did n't anticipate? @!Dr-CREW : Well, the complexities of government in the city, the whole issue of how to get things done through a myriad of levels of government, make probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually get from sort of here to there. @!PRESSMAN : Why is that? Is that historical or is that due to personalities, or what? @!Dr-CREW : Well, I think every city has its own dimension of -- of how agendas get pushed and moved and started and ultimately closed. But I think this one is particularly complex, somewhat made by virtue of personalities. I think that 's really true. I also think it 's a function of the enormity of the task that -- that we start from. I mean, this is a school system that had many years of -- of dollars that were taken from it, many years where facilities had not been adequately fixed, and so forth. And so to try to sort of bring that to a close takes many, many years and many, many artful conversations in the -- behind closed doors. @!PRESSMAN : Now you actually are somewhat dependent, as the chancellor of the school system, on City Hall. It seems to me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Is that true? @!Dr-CREW : Yes, I think that 's a fair characterization of it. @!PRESSMAN : There were times when you got close that you used to smoke cigars together and all that. @!Dr-CREW : Right. Right. @!PRESSMAN : Those cigar-smoking episodes... @!Dr-CREW : Gone. @!PRESSMAN :... seem to be over. @!Dr-CREW : Gone. Gone. @!PRESSMAN : Why is that? @!Dr-CREW : Basically, it 's just that -- you know, I mean, I think that the -- that -- that at least from my end -- I ca n't speak for the mayor -- but certainly from my end, I think that the whole issue of vouchers and the way in which that was actually handled led to a real lack of trust. And I think that somewhat continues even today. We 've been able, I think, both of -- both of us, as statesmen and people who are genuinely trying to do something -- been able to sort of make sense out of our relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think, the school system. But it does mean that it 's a -- it 's a very different relationship than it was before. @!PRESSMAN : What 's been the toughest problem so far for you? @!Dr-CREW : There 've been a number, I 'd say. But probably the -- the -- the hardest one is to actually get beyond political consensus. I mean, there 's usually common ground about what needs to be fixed. There 's very little common ground on how to actually bring together the resources to make that fix actually come into being. And so one can argue that, you know, everybody knows that the -- the -- the state of our facilities is in dire -- in dire circumstance. Yet, there is not agreement on how or even how fast to bring about the resource -- the collection of resources, human as well as financial resources, to get the work done. @!PRESSMAN : Does that frustrate you? @!Dr-CREW : Yes, very much so. Very much so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah, I do. I 've -- I 've -- I am eternally hopeful about this because I think that this is a case of perseverance, that there are always changes in the dynamics that allow for a ray of hope to shine through ; changes in terms of some of the people doing business on the issue ; changes in terms of people changing their minds ; changes just in terms of other people weighing in. I think the business community, I think the parent community, I think other voices bringing -- bringing new ideas and a fresh notion of the possible to these issues, I think, ultimately allows for hope to always be seen. @!PRESSMAN : Now on the voucher issue, I know that you 're very much opposed to school vouchers. But why should n't parents, if they want to send their kids to a private school, have government support in doing so? @!Dr-CREW : I -- I just do n't think that that government should port -- support should come at the expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creation and sustaining of public education. That 's exactly what it means. It means the availability of children t -- and their parents s -- to actually have high-quality schooling available to them at the public expense. They pay for it through their tax dollars, they ought to have it at their tax dollars. I do n't think that -- that the answer to fixing public schools in America is to then divest those public tax dollars and send them off to private education for a few. I think if you really want to fix this, then invest on behalf of fixing the system overall for the ov -- for all kids. @!PRESSMAN : Are you ready to continue to fight vouchers as -- to the best of your ability? @!Dr-CREW : Every day. I think this is -- this is a -- this is -- this notion of simply sort of taking public tax dollars and diverting it from public education, I think it is a -- scandalous. I think it 's wrong. I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite direction of the creation of a democracy. This is not about trying to figure out which children deserve going to good schools. This is about figuring out a system that, in fact, should underwrite the support, the literacy rates, the support of those children being able to be occupationally prepared, for all children, not -- not some portion of this one million bo -- one million student body population that I have. @!PRESSMAN : So you think the voucher idea is an assault on democracy itself? @!Dr-CREW : I think it certainly perverts the notion of democracy. It really does allow there to be a greater sort of chasm as to the sort of have and have not. I mean, consider it just as it -- as you would technology. Some schools have technology, some schools do n't. Some schools actually have teachers who actually embed and know how to use technology in ways by which to enrich their instructional program, and some do not. How many real ingredients, real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where this issue is -- is -- is founded. How many of those ingredients that support classroom instruction do we want to actually create great variability on? I do n't think we should -- we should be in -- creating variability at all. I think we should be decreasing the variability. I think we should be ba -- we ou -- we ought to be saying that a kid who goes to school in the South Bronx is entitled -- is entitled -- it -- it 's a democratic way to entitle that child to the same level of education as we would to a child going to school in Westchester. @!PRESSMAN : We 're coming up on a big political year nationally and as far as the state and the city are concerned : the year 2000. Do you see yourself as duty bound to fight vouchers if it becomes an issue in the campaigns? @!Dr-CREW : I -- I have had a -- a position on this issue from the very beginning, from -- not necessarily New York and California when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on and so forth. I 've done the same when I was the superintendent in Tacoma. I have always felt that this is really about distributing a form of justice called public education throughout the public education system. And if you want to have a sys -- a system where, you know, people basically have the equal opportunity available to them -- what they do with it is another question, but at least they have equal opportunity available to them -- then their public school system and what happens in their classroom greatly matters. And how dollars are shifted or brought into those classrooms deeply matters. So I see myself being an advocate for quality, competitive public education the likes of which I will fight for all the time. And I 'd rather describe this as that 's more what I 'm interested in. I can -- vouchers are not even an issue for me personally. @!PRESSMAN : You think you might be dragged in to save the campaign if it does happen between Hillary Clinton and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't -- I do n't think so. I mean, I 'm smart enough to be able to -- to avoid some of the -- the sort of poli -- the true political mainline kind of conversation that will go on around this topic. I do n't intend to get myself or the system embroiled in that. But I do intend, as an educator, to say what I fundamentally believe is true about fixing the system as opposed to divesting from it. @!PRESSMAN : Now your contract is up next year, and I want to ask you about that and some other issues of -- involving education, after this. @(Announcements) @!PRESSMAN : So you talked about being on the precipice and going one way or the other. Where are we now? Are we moving toward saving the children, as you see it? @!Dr-CREW : Yeah, I think we are. I think that that 's really happening. I think that it is actually going to be a function of what we do both in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact, really have a high level of skill. The work that we 've done in the standards movement overall sort of is suggestive of all of these things. @!PRESSMAN : But has -- has the performance really improved? Have n't there been guidelines that show that there has been very little improvement? @!Dr-CREW : You know what, Gabe? I -- I 'm -- I 'm going to try to dispel this once and for all. I never seem to be able to do it. @!PRESSMAN : Right. @!Dr-CREW : So let me -- let me -- let me just say to you, three years in a row, academic performance in New York City has gone up. OK? Each of those years, we 've had different measurement tools, we 've had different tests. State department changes the test, or in some cases the text itself had to be recalibrated and changed. Nonetheless, measured against the standard test that h -- we administer, each of three years we have shown improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of blurred by this whole testing crisis. @!PRESSMAN : And that was a botched exam... @!Dr-CREW : Right. @!PRESSMAN :... which McGraw-Hill took responsibility for. @!Dr-CREW : Right. Right. Right. But nonetheless... @!PRESSMAN : But you were blamed, were n't you? @!Dr-CREW : Yeah. But -- but -- but -- but be that as it may, this -- I -- I want to actually speak on behalf of the voice of people who did this work and who, in fact, really should deserve the credit, and it 's these kids taught by these teachers in these schools improved. Now in -- in many cases, they did it in spite of -- of us, in some cases, rather than because of us. So the question becomes : How do we actually create not just one, two or three years of high-level performance, but how do we create a whole system, a whole culture, a whole way of doing business where from teacher, to principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this act, everybody understands that this is -- the only game in town is about the performance of these kids and these schools. And that takes a bigger and a broader period of time. @!PRESSMAN : The -- your contract will be coming up next year, and you have to let the board know by December, I understand, whether or not you want, say, a one-year extension on your contract or more. @!Dr-CREW : Right. @!PRESSMAN : Are you pretty well along in your decision process? @!Dr-CREW : Well, I 'm certainly looking at it. As you might guess, there are sort of pros and cons and there are all kinds of issues that -- that one might look at at this time. Basically, it 's going to come down to both my own personal and family related issues, as well as my own professional aspirations. I love what I am doing here and I love the people with whom I have had the -- the grace and the goodness -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we 've made some significant inroads. I do n't think New York will ever really give it to the s -- kids or give it to the -- to the -- to the teachers and principals who have really, really done a yeoman 's job in being able to move this. But I think that the people who are in the know -- I 'm talking about kids and -- who are now taking regents that they never took before, who are going through Saturday and after-school programs and literacy initiatives that they never had before, who have an extended day, kids who have the arts brought back into their schools, kids who now have technology available for them, not in sufficient quantity but certainly far better than when we got here three years ago -- I think that they now know this is a system that basically loves them, cares about them and will set a set of standards that they will not be able to renege on. @!PRESSMAN : If you do n't stay on, do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- on the kids and the teachers? @!Dr-CREW : There 's a tension in my heart about that, yeah. There 's -- there 's -- I believe in this, and I believe we could get it even further ahead. I think that there are some real diminishing qualities of the work, you know, and I 'm not going to speak to all of that now. But, I mean, I think that there are some things that actually impede our progress. And to the extent that one wants to actually still continue to climb this hill, you have to be willing to put up with those things. @!PRESSMAN : Now the politics of New York is going to change. There 's going to be a mayoral election before long, and you might have a different mayor to work with if you stay on. @!Dr-CREW : Well, that certainly is true. And -- and in my way of thinking, that dynamic change is something that I think would -- would actually bode well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas and different thoughts and different -- frankly, different chemistry on the table. I do n't think anybody should be the -- the sole proprietor of thinking or doing this work. I think we all are -- as a community have to be invested in it. So I think whether I 'm here or not here, whether the mayor 's here or not here, I think that the priority for the city has really got to be the reinvestment in a system that trai -- that -- that -- that -- that teaches children. @!PRESSMAN : Speaking of teachers : You 're going to need 40,000 or 50,000 teachers in the next few years, I understand... @!Dr-CREW : Right. Right. @!PRESSMAN :... because of attrition and because of retirements. So what does -- what does that mean in terms of the city? Is that a real crisis, getting those teachers? @!Dr-CREW : It 's an enormous crisis. I mean, the -- the next five years are going to be made by virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have in front of kids. That 's really -- that 's really the issue. Everything you hear me talking about performance is dependent largely upon the human beings we have in classrooms and in schools. That 's where the unit of change is really going to be maximized. So the issue of the 40,000, 50,000 new teachers is a major issue : how they 're trained, what kind of schools they come from and the level of training and preparation they have coming out of universities -- major issue -- how we 're going to actually compensate these people in ways that do far better at acknowledging the work that they do both within the city and frankly within the democracy. @!PRESSMAN : Now you have... @!Dr-CREW : Major issue. @!PRESSMAN : You have a new teacher contract coming up. @!Dr-CREW : Right. @!PRESSMAN : And one of the vexing points in the present teacher contract for you is that teachers do n't have to clear their lesson plans with prin -- principals. Are you going to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract? @!Dr-CREW : Well, I -- let me just say that I think there are going to be a number of issues that we have to take up as a part of the contract that all stem from the standards movement. A -- the second we s -- that we said out loud that we 're going to declare what 's the benchmark that really constitutes a good enough showing of student performance to be able to qualify a kid to go from one grade to the next... @!PRESSMAN : Right. @!Dr-CREW : The second we declared that, that meant every other system in New York -- everything else we do in the system has to be completely rethought if not redone. The contract is no -- is no -- is not going to be excused from that. So issues like how principals and teachers talk about lesson plans and what preparation they 're making or what student body they 're able to make gains with and which student -- which portion of the student body we 're not, how we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train teachers or give them additional expertise -- all of that is going to have to be rethought. And I think that means a completely reformist teacher lab -- labor union, labor-management contract, a very different way of being able to understand how this agreement supports classrooms. @!PRESSMAN : The Morlendack Commission appointed by the governor was to look into school construction abuses, and then it was extended into the question of whether or not the attendance figures have been falsified for New York cities in the schools so that you 're qualified for more state funding. @!Dr-CREW : Right. @!PRESSMAN : Do you think that that was a -- a fair inquiry? @!Dr-CREW : No, I do n't. I said then I thought this was a ruse, and I believe it is now. I think this is just simply a way of being able to have the state -- or at least from the governor 's standpoint -- have them have some opportunity to say that the system is broken beyond repair, and therefore we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money, and so on and so forth. That 's beginning to be, frankly, an old and tired excuse and -- for not funding our kids. The real issue is we have a transparent budget system that we put in place the second we got in here. It walked in the door with us with the help of Harry Spence and Judy and a number of other people in the department. We put in place so we could track every single nickel in every single school. We made massive leadership changes in the first year, second year and the third year, and we 'll continue to do it to the extent that it 's necessary. We have really invested in the creation of a document that goes out and tells everybody where the money is so that we actually have a school expenditure report for every single school in New York City. @!PRESSMAN : And what about the attendance figures? Have they been falsified? @!Dr-CREW : There have been and -- I think in the margins, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been ce -- pe -- people who, in fact, did n't do it correctly. But I do n't think that that is a large enough issue to warrant this huge gun being trained on -- on -- on this school system. @!PRESSMAN : What -- what about the issue of the 38 percent of school population being in New York City, where 34 percent of the school aid from Albany... @!Dr-CREW : If you want to -- if you actually want to get at the issue of how money should and could be used in New York, that 's the starting place. Look at this base formula by which -- right now, New York City schools represent, basically, 38 percent of student population. We have 34 percent of the money. There 's -- there -- we start off behind the eight ball before our kids even get an opportunity to compete. @!PRESSMAN : Our -- our time is up. A yes or no answer : Do you in -- intend to fight against what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do. @!PRESSMAN : For how long? @!Dr-CREW : For as long as I possibly can. @!PRESSMAN : Thank you, Chancellor Crew... @!Dr-CREW : Thank you. @!PRESSMAN :... for joining us this morning. And now stay tuned for more of " Sunday Today in New York. "
