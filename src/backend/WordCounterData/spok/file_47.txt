228141 Rep. NEWT GINGRICH,( R-GA), Speaker of the House : Our Whip count now shows at least 84 percent of the Republicans voting yes. So if we could break even with the Democrats, we'll- term limits will pass. TOM FOLEY, Former Congressman,( D-WA) ; Former Speaker of the House : If there was ever a need for term limits, and I do n't personally believe- support term limits, the last election kind of proves that you do n't have to have term limits to change the House of Representatives and the Senate @!ANNOUNCER voice-over From Washington, Crossfire. On the left, Mike Kinsley. On the right, John Sununu. Tonight, Term Limits and the GOP. In the crossfire, Republican Congressman Bill McCollum of Florida and Republican Congressman Pete King of New York. MICHAEL KINSLEY : Good evening. Welcome to Crossfire. voice-over The House is expected to vote tomorrow on term limits. There are four different versions under consideration. The Republican leadership bill would set 12-year terms for both the House and the Senate. One variant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Senate, another would allow the states to set lower limits as they want as many already have, and mischievous Democrats have proposed applying term limits now to current members instead of just in the future. That would force the retirement, among others, of Speaker Newt Gingrich who has already been in office for 17 years. As a constitutional amendment, term limits need two-thirds of the House, or 290 votes. Probably none of the four versions has that much support. Republicans are gearing up to blame Democrats for a term limits defeat, but as you 're about to see, many Republicans are also opposed. on camera Not Marilyn Quayle, however, who 's back as Crossfire 's co-host tonight. Marilyn. MARILYN QUAYLE : Thanks, Michael. Congressmen, it 's nice to have you both here. Congressman King, I 'm a Republican, you 're a Republican, and this last ' 94 election was a watershed for our party, but are n't you betraying your contract with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by not supporting term limits? Rep. PETE KING,( R-NY) : No, not at all, because term limits was the one part of the Contract- from the start, a number of Republicans, including- Henry Hyde and Tom DeLay, Susan Molinari and I made it clear that we were supporting the concept of everything coming up to a vote but not for final passage. I made it clear I 'd vote for the rule authorizing a vote on term limits, but I was opposed to term limits because, basically, what I feel- they 're undemocratic and, if there 's any message of the 1994 election, it 's we do n't need term limits. MARILYN QUAYLE : Oh, however, the ' 94 election did n't really show that because, of the incumbents that ran for reelection, 91 percent were reelected which means the power of incumbency is incredible, and if we 're going to diminish that power, if we 're going to end career politicians, do n't we need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all, it 's up to the voters to decide what politicians they want to end the careers of. It 's not up to people in Washington or elitists to decide who the people in the district- in the different districts can vote for, and the fact is we have- more than half of the Congress has been elected since 1990 which shows there can be a turnover, but I 'm not even so sure that a turnover, per se, is necessarily good. It 's up to the American people in each district to decide who they want to represent them in Congress. MARILYN QUAYLE : But, you know, with 72 percent of the women in Congress and 81 percent of minorities coming- winning their seats, actually, only in open seats, are n't you really restricting the election of those kinds of people, eliminating diversity within Congress? Are n't you really setting people back? Rep. PETE KING : Well, you know, Republicans are n't supposed to be out trying to create diversity. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Rep. PETE KING : We should stand for letting the American people vote for whomever they want, whether it 's men, women, Republican, Democrat, liberal, or conservative. That 's what democracy is all about. We should n't be in Washington telling the people back in the district that they ca n't vote for someone just because they happen to be there 12 years. You would have lost people like Bob Dole or Robert Taft or Henry Clay or even my good friend, Bill McCollum. MARILYN QUAYLE : Yeah, but nobody 's indispensable. MICHAEL KINSLEY : Bill- Bill McCollum, Speaker Gingrich had an article in The Washington Post this morning about term limits. He says, ' America no longer needs or desires a class of permanent career politicians. ' Gosh, is n't Newt Gingrich himself a permanent career politician? He started running for Congress in his 20s. He got elected. He 's done nothing but Congress for 17 years now. Is n't he- is he the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to him? Rep. BILL McCOLLUM,( R-FL) : Well, this is not a throw-your- the-bums-out movement. This is a change-the-attitude movement, term limits is, and what I think Newt Gingrich was referring to is the fact that, when our founding fathers created this country, they saw members coming to Washington about two months out of the year. They went back home. They did their business, as they did n't have that much to do. They served an average of no more than two terms in the House for nearly a hundred years, and then only in the last 50 years or so, we 've seen this year-round Congress because government 's grown so big, and we 've seen a career orientation where members come here now having to give up jobs back home, where the rules- the actual law says you ca n't practice some professions, like law and accounting, and be here, and most members do n't have outside incomes. So what we have today are members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they, therefore, have a different kind of desire to get reelected, not just to serve their country, but to stay here, and as a result of that, it is my impression and many term limit supporters ' impressions, that what you have is too much voting to try to please every special interest out there, not to get campaign finance monies but to get the votes back home, and the very fact that you 're trying not to displease every interest group means that leads to distortions. I leads to more difficulty getting a balanced budget. It means a lot of things that can only be corrected by term limits, by limiting the length of time you 're here and mitigating some of that constant pressure- MICHAEL KINSLEY : Yes, but- Rep. BILL McCOLLUM : -to worry about pleasing every group back home. MICHAEL KINSLEY : The premise of this- of your theory is that there 's something disgraceful about being a permanent career politician. Now is there anything disgraceful about Bill McCollum? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : No, there 's nothing dis- nothing disgraceful whatsoever. That 's not the point of the matter. The point of the matter is- MICHAEL KINSLEY : What 's wrong- Rep. BILL McCOLLUM : -that the attitude that goes- MICHAEL KINSLEY : Is America sick of Bill McCollum? Rep. BILL McCOLLUM : -the attitude that goes with that, the attitude of careerism that embodies- MICHAEL KINSLEY : Do you have that? Do you have that attitude? Rep. BILL McCOLLUM : I 'd like to believe I do n't. I guess others can judge that better. MICHAEL KINSLEY : Does Newt Gingrich have that attitude? Rep. BILL McCOLLUM : It does n't matter. It does n't matter whether- how many people have it, but a lot of people do, and it does matter in the long-run sense, and the only way you can ever mitigate that, the only way you can take away some of this effort to always try to please every interest group back home to get reelected is to have term limits, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Republicans did with the rules change this year to end those who would serve 15, 20, or 30 years as chairmen of committees is by term limits and assuring that flesh blood comes here every time. MICHAEL KINSLEY : Well, in that case, what possible justification is there for not going with this proposed Democratic change in this to at least apply it to you guys who have already been here, who are permanent politicians and so on and so forth? Rep. BILL McCOLLUM : Well, again, it 's not a throw-the-bums-out movement. Retroactivity is not any better for this than it is for taxes or any other provision, and you 've got 22 states- MICHAEL KINSLEY : Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Rep. BILL McCOLLUM : Twenty-two states, Michael, have passed term limits in this country and, today, not a one of them have retroactivity, and the one state where the vote came up- Washington State did n't pass retroactivity. It had to take a separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm asking you to apply your own argument you 've just been making to this issue. If there 's something bad about career politicians on average- there are exceptions, like you, but if on average career politicians have the wrong attitude toward government and if the purpose of term limits is to throw out the career politicians, why should it not apply to the career politicians who are in Congress right now? Rep. BILL McCOLLUM : It does apply. It applies equally to everybody once it starts to run in the Constitution. MICHAEL KINSLEY : Starting now. Rep. BILL McCOLLUM : Let it happen. Rep. PETE KING : To me, the Constitution should only be amended for an eternal true, if there 's something which is so clearly right or so clearly wrong that we have to either put it in the Constitution or take it out. For instance, slavery. The Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery. And, to me, if term limits are so essentially true, then I think, actually, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get out, if it 's that important. If term limits- if long service in Congress is by its nature wrong, then I think that those who support it should step aside. Rep. BILL McCOLLUM : Well, you know, if you do this voluntarily, though, Pete, what you- winds up happening is a disproportionate favor to those who stay here. I 've always said when, you know, Kennedy wants to walk out, Bonior wants to walk out, Gephardt wants to walk out and show the leadership, then I 'll go, too, but it's- but the bottom line is- MICHAEL KINSLEY : So why not pass this Democratic version which would say that you all have to walk out? Rep. BILL McCOLLUM : Well, we are going to all walk out together at the time when this all ultimately comes- MICHAEL KINSLEY : Twelve years from now. Seventeen years from now. Rep. BILL McCOLLUM : That 's a distraction, and it 's mischief. That 's it. MARILYN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term limits debate, and it 's a prime example of why we need term limits, because they 're absolutely showing the arrogance of people who think they 'll never be defeated, and that 's really, really, really too bad. MICHAEL KINSLEY : I do n't follow that logic at all. MARILYN QUAYLE : Well, it 's very logical if you look at it. It 's a very arrogant bill. A very arrogant bill. It was put in to ridicule the whole system. But back to your constitutional argument, in 1947 when the House voted on limiting the terms of Presidents, the House also voted on limiting the terms of Congress. It went to the Senate, was put out. Why do n't we go back to a balance of power where both the presidency is limited in office and put it back- Congress is limited in terms of office? If it 's good for the President, why is n't it good for Congress? Rep. PETE KING : I think in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President serving two terms. I think in a democracy- in a representative democracy, people should be allowed to vote for whomever they want, and that, to me, is what a democracy is all about. We should n't be imposing- let 's face it, as a Republican, I think we can admit that that was done as retaliation against Franklin Roosevelt. That 's why the two-term limit was put on Presidents. I think we should be- MICHAEL KINSLEY : And I believe quite a few Republicans, including Ronald Reagan, wanted to lift it in the early 1980s. Rep. PETE KING : In fact, at the end of Ronald Reagan 's second term, he was talking about repealing that amendment. Now I just think it goes against democracy and, also, it sort of bothers me that the three of us who should be together are sort of- you know, Michael Kinsley 's managed to divide us which is really somewhat- MARILYN QUAYLE : Frightening, is n't it? Rep. BILL McCOLLUM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 's unusual. You 're a good guy, though. We always knew there were- MICHAEL KINSLEY : Let me give you another quote from Speaker Gingrich in this morning 's Washington Post. ' This vote says to the American people that this is their country. It 's says our citizens- to our citizens that they are entrusted with greater control. ' Now I do n't follow that at all. As Pete King was saying, this vote says to the people, ' You 're not in control. You may wish to elect Pete King to an extra term in Congress, but we, under the Constitution, are not going to allow you to. ' Rep. BILL McCOLLUM : Michael, what he 's referring to is the fact that the most democratic thing we can do is follow what nearly 80 percent of the American public in poll after poll say they want, and that 's term limits, and you ca n't get much more democratic than when you take a constitutional amendment to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it. That 's very democratic. If the people want this, and they do, then that is the ultimate in democracy. That 's why we have the provision allowing us to amend the Constitution. Yes, it should be taken seriously. Only when you have something really major should you amend it. This is really major. I do n't believe things are working well. That 's why we 've had the problems with the balanced-budget amendment and some other things. That 's why big government 's grown so big today, is we 've had a power structure in this town for a long time who have been abusing that system, and it can happen again even though we just turned over that with the last election. It can easily happen again when the next power structure comes to town, if we do n't have term limits. MICHAEL KINSLEY : OK. We have to take a little break here. When we come back, we 're going to find out why the term limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARCY KAPTUR,( D-OH) : I for one do n't want to undermine the Constitution. I for one want a blend of experience and people who ca n't be bought in this chamber. I do n't support term limits, it undermines the Constitution, and we ought to stand up for what 's right for the American people. Rep. RANDY TATE,( R-WA) : The people purporting this plan have been in office longer than I 've been alive. It 's a crock. It 's a sham. Commercial break Rep. BILL RICHARDSON,( D-NM) : We already have term limits - they 're called elections - every two years. We do n't need another constitutional amendment to change what the voters already have done. Rep. WALTER JONES,( R-NC) : Anyone who sits in this Congress who disagrees with giving the citizens of this country a chance to vote on this very popular and important issue, in my opinion, shows no confidence in the people which elected them. MARILYN QUAYLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key element of the Contract With America - is all but dead, and both parties are now pointing fingers at each other trying to affix political blame. Tonight, we 're debating term limits with two Republicans - Peter King, a second-term Congressman from New York who 's opposed to term limits, and Bill McCollum, the Florida Republican who 's sponsoring the GOP bill. Michael. MICHAEL KINSLEY : Bill McCollum, U.S. Term Limits which is the term limits lobby has called you a phony, and here 's the reason. There are 22 states, as you pointed out, that have voted term limits, such as California which has a lower limit that 's in- than is in your bill, six years for members of Congress. Your bill would make it 12 years and would supersede these state laws, and they say why should the- you 'd actually be increasing the ability of members to stay in Congress rather than decreasing it under your bill. Rep. BILL McCOLLUM : Well, first of all, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, shot themselves in the foot by all of their advertising against not just me but all kinds of term limits supporters this year because they want to have it their way, six years or not at all, and instead of spending their money, which they should have been doing, trying to get votes for us by working on those who are opposed to it or leaning, you know, undecided, they spent their money doing their advertising like they did. But, secondly, to get to the substantive point, my proposal does not do away with what 's done by the states. It leaves it up to the Supreme Court and whatever they decide coming out in that Arkansas case later this year. If the Supreme Court decides that, under the Constitution as it 's presently written, the states have the power to decide for themselves in these state initiatives, then that will stand under my amendment. If, on the other hand, they decide that the states do n't have that right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution, then there will be, if mine passes, a uniform standard throughout the nation of 12 years. MICHAEL KINSLEY : Bill, that 's a complete cop-out. Here you are amending the Constitution- or you were trying to amend the Constitution to get term limits. The question of should the states get to decide if they want a lower limit is up there for grabs, and you 're saying you 're not going to decide. You 're going to let the Supreme Court decide it. Rep. BILL McCOLLUM : Oh, I 'd prefer- listen, Michael, I 'd prefer- MICHAEL KINSLEY : On what basis should- why should- if you 're going to tamper with the Constitution on the subject of term limits, why should n't you settle this issue? Rep. BILL McCOLLUM : Well, I think the real question here is whether we want to mess with this part of the Constitution or not, and there are a lot of term limits supporters- MICHAEL KINSLEY : You 're messing with it. Rep. BILL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to get to 290 votes. To be perfectly frank, I would prefer uniformity. I would prefer putting in an absolute phrase that says everybody gets whatever we pass, but the fact of the matter is that we have a certain number of members who will support term limits but wo n't support it in that version. So we 're trying to get to 290. MICHAEL KINSLEY : What is the justification for the position you would like to see adopted? Why should n't California, if they want to have six-year limits instead of 12-year limits, be able to do that? Rep. BILL McCOLLUM : Well, what you do n't want, Michael, is a hodgepodge which- under Mr. Hilleary 's version which will be out on the floor, and people will get to vote on it, which will be a 12-year cap, and then the states can decide anything under it they want, you would forever have some states with six years, some states with eight. MICHAEL KINSLEY : So what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a- MICHAEL KINSLEY : We 're being told by you Republicans every day that the states have the- Rep. BILL McCOLLUM : I think that 's bad public policy. MICHAEL KINSLEY : -the states have all the wisdom and the federal government does n't have any. Rep. BILL McCOLLUM : No. They do n't have it when it comes to structuring the fundamentals of the Constitution. That 's a two-party street, and the federal- there 's nothing more federal than the Constitution. There 's nothing more federal than the limits of terms or the length of terms of members of Congress. You know, the other side of this, too, that I 'd like to point out is that we talked about and- I saw the promo coming into this segment that somehow we 're going to try to blame somebody for the failure of term limits. Actually, the truth of the matter is we never, as Pete King said at the beginning of this show, as Republicans thought that we could get to 290. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working very hard. We 've got 85 percent of the Republicans, I think, who are going to vote for it. We need only 50 percent, as Newt Gingrich says. We 've got a letter we 've sent out to the President that 's been signed by a whole bunch of people saying, ' Please, if you just support term limits, maybe we could get the other Democrats we need to get to the 290. ' It 's a real tough- MICHAEL KINSLEY : Do n't be absurd. He does n't support term limits. You think a letter from you is going to change his mind after this late date? Rep. BILL McCOLLUM : Well, he said he might- he said he might support them at the end of this Congress depending on how this Congress performed. MICHAEL KINSLEY : And he was- he was- that was what we call a joke. MARILYN QUAYLE : But do n't you think that if we do n't have term limits, Congress will continue in the mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for getting pork-barrel projects in their own districts? They 're careerists who- the only reason they get reelected is what they can bring back home. That 's not what the founding fathers wanted. How do you get beyond that? Rep. PETE KING : I think what the founding fathers wanted was for the people in the districts to elect their member of Congress, but I think this first hundred days has shown what Congress can do. I think that the 1994 election showed that with all the pork barrel, with all the powers of incumbency that the American people can turn it around in Congress completely if the message is unintelligible the right way. They 've done that, and I think the fact that- even though Bill and I are having this disagreement over this one issue, the fact is the Republican Party has marched together. We 're going to adopt 85, 90 percent of everything we promised we would in the first hundred days which shows that Congress can do the job. MARILYN QUAYLE : However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn around after 40-some odd years. We ca n't afford to only change the way government is done because of scandal. We need to have a mechanism there that allows for cutting through the power of incumbency, which is great. You get free media all the time. You have a salary that 's huge compared to most people that you can campaign on. Your incumbents- unless they 're independently wealthy. Of- your challengers ca n't compete with that. Nobody can quit their jobs and go against a guy that 's making four times what the average American is making and expect to be able to succeed. Rep. PETE KING : Well, the two times I ran for Congress, I ran against millionaires, and I was outspent four to one and two to one the two times I ran. So you can get elected if you have the right message, but I do n't think, again, that we should be telling the American people who they can vote for. To me, it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my district want to vote for me for 40 years, fine. If they want to throw me out next term, fine. I 'll go back to how I make a living. I just do n't think we should be telling the American people who they should vote for. And go back and look at the leaders, people like Robert Taft, Everett Dirksen, Bob Dole. All these people would have been gone if we had term limits. Rep. BILL McCOLLUM : But there are thousands of good Americans, very talented Americans, Pete, that could come in and take their place. Now I know we 'll lose some good people even today, like Henry Hyde and a few others that you and I can name here tonight, but the fact remains there 's just a huge talent pool out there. The question is, Is the problem facing the nation today, is the problem with the institution itself so great we need to make this change? I think it is. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think that when we do make the change, though, we need to be sure that whatever we do is uniform between the Senate and the House because I think if you have a term limit that 's less for the House than for the Senate, you 've probably made the House a weaker body vis-a-vis the Senate. Things like that- there are two different debates here. One is should we have it all, and then what form do we have it in. Rep. PETE KING : Well, I think it should be uniform, but I think it's- MICHAEL KINSLEY : You know, you- Rep. PETE KING : -important to also point out, though, if we 're talking about the power of Congress, I think one of the problems with Congress was the power that staff accumulated over the years, and if we have term limits on members of Congress, if we have to have term limits restricted, that 's going to give more and more power to unelected staff, and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, every time I 've watched Congress over the last 18 years and a new Congressman has come in to chair a committee, he 'll change the entire staff, even if it 's the same party. So when you have the influx going in and out, you 're going to see bigger and bigger turnovers, which will be very, very good. Rep. PETE KING : Yeah, but I think if Congressmen and Congresswomen are coming in so quickly and getting out so quickly, you 're going to need an institutional memory, and only the staff will have that type of institutional memory, and that will be more dangerous. Rep. BILL McCOLLUM : Well, your criticism is valid for the six-year limit but not for the 12 years that 's mine. I think if you 're here six years, you get the experience. Then you 're able to serve as chairman of a committee or be in leadership. Rep. PETE KING : Maybe I- Rep. BILL McCOLLUM : Twelve is a good deal, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit has arrived. Thank you, Peter King. Rep. PETE KING : Thank you. MICHAEL KINSLEY : Thank you, Bill McCollum. MARILYN QUAYLE : Thank you. MICHAEL KINSLEY : Marilyn Quayle and I will be back shortly. Commercial break MARILYN QUAYLE : You know, we should n't want or need scandal or- to force a change in Congress, and that 's really what happened this last election. The American people have spoken in polls and in the election. They want term limits. We 're going to have an interesting debate tomorrow and an interesting vote. I hope it comes out for term limits. MICHAEL KINSLEY : Here 's one of the things that puzzles me about the de- about the supporters of term limits. They seem to be completely contradictory. Some of them say the idea is to get the politicians closer to the people, that they move to Washington and lose touch, and this is a cure for that. Others such as George Will and Senator- and Bill McCollum was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea is to make the politicians- liberate them from having to worry about the voters all the time, and now- MARILYN QUAYLE : It 's the combination. MICHAEL KINSLEY : Well, those are totally contradictory. MARILYN QUAYLE : No, they 're not. No, they 're not. MICHAEL KINSLEY : Explain the- because- I 'm a little simpleton. They seem completely- MARILYN QUAYLE : You get closer to your constituents when you are forced to go back and live among them, when you 're forced to work under the laws that you 've passed. Right now, you make a career at it. You get a good salary. You take pork back home. MICHAEL KINSLEY : So you- but how does that serve the purposes of the people who say the idea of term limits is to liberate people from having to- MARILYN QUAYLE : Because you can- MICHAEL KINSLEY : -go to the voters. MARILYN QUAYLE : You can be more deliberative because you are not having to get the money for campaigning, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career job so you do n't have to look at special interests to get their votes. MICHAEL KINSLEY : Wait a minute. MARILYN QUAYLE : You get the good of the people, and you go back home and you- MICHAEL KINSLEY : You listen to the- MARILYN QUAYLE : -live under it. MICHAEL KINSLEY : You listen to the people, and you act on what the people want, but you do n't have to listen to the special interest because you do n't need to be reelected. Who are- I mean, that makes no sense at all. MARILYN QUAYLE : Well, the special interest put a great deal of pressure on everybody, but if you have the time to think, it will come out, and you 're not worried about that reelection, and the other thing is, Michael, after- MICHAEL KINSLEY : Well- MARILYN QUAYLE : After I 've watched campaigns, been in campaigns, it is very difficult to understand the impact of your laws if you 're not working under those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have term limits, but we ought to change the ethics so that you have a job back home and work part time in the legislature. MICHAEL KINSLEY : Our term limit is up. From the left, I 'm Mike Kinsley. Good night for Crossfire. MARILYN QUAYLE : From the right, I 'm Marilyn Quayle. Join Michael and John Sununu tomorrow night for another edition of Crossfire.
