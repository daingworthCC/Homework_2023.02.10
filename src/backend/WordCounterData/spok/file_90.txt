235041 @!ANNOUNCER : From ABC, this is World News Tonight with Peter Jennings. PETER JENNINGS : Good evening.They have taken a knife to General Motors and in some cases GM management has used a meat ax. The world 's largest car manufacturer said today that part of the fundamental change in the way it intends to do business means that 21 plants will be closed in the US and thousands of jobs eliminated. All across the GM system tonight the uncertainty created by GM 's financial hemorrhaging over the last several years has been heightened by fear of the details yet to come. In the words of one worker at the Arlington plant in Texas, " This reaches down into every nook and cranny of a GM employee 's life ". Our first report is from ABC 's Chris Bury. CHRIS BURY : GM BLDG EXT GM acted today because its North American business is losing half a billion dollars every month, hammered by the recession, foreign competition and its own inefficiency. The sea of unsold cars outside the Flint assembly plant points to GM 's critical failings : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Motors knows it must shrink to compete. PLANT EXT ROBERT STEMPEL / GENERAL MOTORS CHAIRMAN : A leaner, more productive, more efficient General Motors will be ready to face the mid-90 's and GM will become a much different corporation. CHRIS BURY : ASSEMBLY LINE GM hopes to avoid layoffs by eliminating most of the 24,000 jobs through attrition and early retirement. GRAPHICS They include 15,000 union workers and 9,000 white collar employees. By 1995, GM hopes to trim another 50,000 jobs. To accomplish all this, the company will close six assembly plants and 15 smaller factories. In addition, GM will freeze hiring, shut down all operations for two weeks next summer and cut capital spending by more than one billion dollars. JOE PHILIPPI, SHEARSON LEHMAN : It is now going through a dramatic crisis, clearly. And it 's been forced to downsize itself to reflect the realities of the market. CHRIS BURY : OLD ASSEMBLY LINE FTG In its heyday, a profitable GM not only commanded the country 's car market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company, known as " Generous Motors ", was rewarded with a job for life, sizable benefits and a bonus every Christmas. Today, GM even took away the Christmas bonus. DAVID COLE / U. OF MICHIGAN : So what GM is going through in terms of their leaning and trimming and rationalization is absolutely a matter of survival. They have to do it. CHRIS BURY : SU GM says the job losses will be cushioned. Many white collar employees will be offered buyouts. Union workers are guaranteed a temporary income. But what makes these cutbacks so different is that no one here expects the lost jobs to ever come back. Chris Bury, ABC News, Detroit. PETER JENNINGS : As part of the overall reorganization, workers at two GM plants find themselves in an " us " or " them " situation. GM says it must close one of two auto assembly plants : either the one in Arlington, Texas, or the Willow Run plant in Ypsilanti, Michigan. The question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arlington, Texas. LINDA PATTILLO : WORKERS EXITING PLANT The 3,700 workers at the Arlington plant do not know whether they will be the ones to lose their jobs. 1ST GM EMPLOYEE : Well, it could be it for us. 2ND GM EMPLOYEE : You know, I 've just got to sit and wait and worry about it, like everybody else. 3RD GM EMPLOYEE : It 's just nervousness. Very frustrating. Very unhappy. You know, no one wants to be without a job. LINDA PATTILLO : ASSEMBLY LINE No one wanted it to come down to this : one plant 's workforce against another. But GM says either this plant or the one in Michigan will have to close. 4TH GM EMPLOYEE : I feel sorry for their family, I feel sorry for my family. I just wish everybody the best. LINDA PATTILLO : MEMBERS-POLL SIGN ON DOOR Even as GM was making the announcement, union members here were voting on whether to allow their leadership to negotiate concessions on overtime and work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will convince the company to keep their plant open. 5TH GM EMPLOYEE : I 'm not sure we 're going to be that happy with it but I guess it 's better than being without a job. LINDA PATTILLO : SU Other businesses in town could be hurt as well. The GM plant has a payroll of 120 million dollars a year. HANNA COOKING Jack Hanna just bought the fried chicken restaurant across the street from the plant. JACK HANNA / RESTAURANT OWNER : It 's going to hurt and hurt my family. It means I 've got to have another job at night just to go on with the business. LINDA PATTILLO : LAUK FAMILY Richard Lauk has worked at the plant for eight years. It 's hard for him and his wife to think about Christmas when they 're bracing themselves for the worst. RICHARD LAUK : I 'm not prepared for it. LINDA PATTILLO : Financially? RICHARD LAUK : Emotionally or financially. It 's devastating to us. LINDA PATTILLO : The awful uncertainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their jobs will be lost or saved. Linda Pattillo, ABC News, Arlington, Texas. PETER JENNINGS : President Bush was in Texas today, not far away from the GM plant. SIGNING Mr. Bush had gone to a highway construction site to sign a 151 billion dollar transportation bill that he said could be summed up in three words : jobs, jobs, jobs. Mr. Bush said the legislation will pump 11 billion dollars into the economy and create about 600,000 jobs next year alone.The man to whom many in government and business turn when looking for a way out of the recession warned today against looking for shortcuts. The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board Alan Greenspan says there are no easy answers. Here 's ABC 's Stephen Aug. STEPHEN AUG : GREENSPAN Greenspan told the House Ways and Means Committee the numbers show the economy should be recovering. But he conceded it 's not. COMMITTEE And the reason, he said, is an unusual loss of confidence. ALAN GREENSPAN / FED CHAIRMAN : There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you I have not seen in my lifetime. It is very hard to grasp the depth of the concerns unless you look at it as a problem about their future. STEPHEN AUG : He said people could get past short-term hardships but they 're worried now about long-term economic survival for themselves and their children. Greenspan indicated the Fed might lower interest rates further but he could offer no timetable for an economic recovery. ALAN GREENSPAN : What we are looking at is a pause, a different type of pause than we 've seen in past recoveries but a pause nevertheless, in an economy which overall is in the process of recovering. STEPHEN AUG : SU Greenspan rejected so-called quick fixes for the economy, like the plan circulating in the Administration to give every taxpayer a one time 300 dollar rebate. He suggested Congress would do better to concentrate on the long term and let the recovery come around on its own. Stephen Aug, ABC News, Washington. PETER JENNINGS : Another note about General Motors : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say today. The stock lost only an eighth of a point, to close at 27 and three-quarters. Also on Wall Street today, the Dow Jones Industrial average gained nearly six points to close at 2,908 and the trading was active.In a moment, the other news : Secretary Baker on the road with a message of American values and about nuclear containment ; also, a crackdown on those who may be selling confidential information about you ; and on the American Agenda tonight, tearing holes in the social safety net. Commercial break PETER JENNINGS : Overseas, Secretary of State Baker finished his tour of former Soviet republics today. The Bush Administration has been playing down what influence it might be able to exert on what will replace the old union, but what the Secretary heard today was apparently very encouraging. ABC 's John McWethy is with him. JOHN MCWETHY : BAKER As Secretary Baker traveled to Byelorussia and Ukraine today he was again selling American principles and values as the standard by which change in this part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomatic recognition as the reward for adopting American standards on democracy, free markets and nuclear safety. And every leader with whom Baker has met seems eager to win that reward, especially in Ukraine, which is the most powerful republic after Russia. BAKER-KRAVCHUK Baker praised the direction of change. JAMES BAKER / SECRETARY OF STATE : Republics that embrace these principles and values, the United States will recognize. Ukraine, as I 've indicated to the President this evening, is in the forefront of those republics. JOHN MCWETHY : KRAVCHUK The high praise for Ukrainian President Kravchuk is in contrast to a more restrained assessment of Boris Yeltsin 's efforts next door in Russia. YELTSIN It is perhaps an effort to push Yeltsin, who also wants US recognition, on the nuclear issue. Yeltsin has said his republic will probably keep a nuclear arsenal. MEETING What Baker found today in both Byelorussia and Ukraine was a strong interest in getting rid of nuclear weapons quickly, with Kravchuk saying he would like the thousands of nuclear weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if possible. SU It 's anticipated that American experts will be traveling to these republics next month to help with plans to begin destruction of the weapons. Secretary Baker will also be traveling to this part of the world in January, exerting more pressure for change that is both peaceful and on American terms.John McWethy, ABC News, Kiev, Ukraine. PETER JENNINGS : Diplomatic recognition is not all the republics want. In some cases there is a desperate need for overseas economic help. The question is what kind? ABC 's John Donvan is in Moscow. JOHN DONVAN : PLANE They are flying medicine into Moscow this week : 20 million dollars worth donated by US drug companies. UNLOADING PLANE It is only a small part of the medical aid and food aid sent by the West this year. The help is appreciated, although it is not all that some here would hope for. HALLWAY SCENE During an after- hours tour of a factory that makes sausages, the manager said she would prefer that the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better food here. WOMAN / FACTORY MANAGER : INTERPRETER Our farms produce enough, it 's more a problem of eliminating waste. Even at this factory, we could get rid of waste if we had the right technology. JOHN DONVAN : STAIRWAY She has taken potential foreign investors on this tour. The trouble is, none of them saw enough profit potential to come back a second time. The Number 20 Children 's Hospital, where they rely on French medicine, and where a German bank bought them this X-ray system that the doctors say is 90 percent more efficient than the old one. HOSPITAL SCENE But one doctor says it is the whole medical system that needs reforming and for that they could use a lot more western know-how, such as how to make the hospital more financially efficient. PATIENTS Despite years of education, the doctors and people in other professions say that after so many years under Communism hardly anyone here can teach standard business practice. VICTOR KREMENIUK / US-CANADA INSTITUTE : We can not train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the private economy. JOHN DONVAN : CLASSROOM But that may be changing. The Moscow Chapter of Junior Achievement : a program set up here by US teachers where high school students learn to run a business, along the way also learning that making money is not always antisocial. KIDS WITH COMPUTERS SOVIET TEENAGER : I hope I 'll help my country to be one of the best countries in the world. JOHN DONVAN : There are still Russians who, out of pride, say they need no help from the West, but most of them belong to an older generation than this. John Donvan, ABC News, Moscow. PETER JENNINGS : In Washington today, round two of the Middle East peace talks has ended : nothing accomplished yet. DELEGATES The Israeli and Arab delegations have agreed to meet again next month : no decision on where. In a moment, cracking down on privacy pirates. Commercial break PETER JENNINGS : For the first time today, federal agents around the country began arresting people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you : your financial records, your taxes, your job history - information the government says is not theirs to sell. Here 's ABC 's John Martin. JOHN MARTIN : OFFICE SCENES In New York, at a Social Security office, FBI agents arrested a claims officer and accused him of taking bribes to give out confidential employment histories to private investigators. SUSPECT The other suspects taken into custody include private investigators, a policeman and other government employees. Their arrests open the door on a twilight world of information brokers. GEORGE AT COMPUTER The brokers collect and sell computerized information on everything from telephone credit card calls to tax and property records. CU SCREEN Texas information broker George Theodore was arrested today on theft and conspiracy charges. In the past he insisted he acted legally, purchasing computer disks holding 90 million names, addresses and telephone numbers. GEORGE THEODORE : It 's awfully hard for you to hide from somebody like... from somebody like me. JOHN MARTIN : The broker 's customers are landlords, employers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out undesirables : everyone from prospective tenants to prospective borrowers. Given one piece of information, like a social security or credit card number, a broker can find out much more. CREDIT CARD PURCHASE CONGRESSMAN ROBERT WISE : The most routine transaction in the marketplace can trigger a whole wave of information being sold about that individual. JOHN MARTIN : COMPUTER DATA BANK Some of the information is accurate, some erroneous and some incomplete. That is one reason FBI crime files are supposed to be for law enforcement use only. At a detective agency in Washington, ABC producer James Bamford posed as a prospective customer and secretly videotaped a private investigator who bragged about how he gains entry to confidential FBI records. HIDDEN CAMERA VIDEO PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR : The person I use or the agent I use has access to the entire federal, ah, you know, NCIC, which is the National Criminal Index. That 's how we do it. I mean, there 's no other way to do it. JOHN MARTIN : SU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws protecting privacy. For years, Big Brother meant government spying, but today Big Brother can mean your landlord, your boss or your neighbor. John Martin, ABC News, Washington. PETER JENNINGS : In the other news today, two reports on health care. A new review of Census Bureau statistics shows that another million Americans lost their health insurance in 1990, which means now that nearly 35 million people are uninsured. And a federal panel set up to advise the government on how to reform the health care system is calling for national health insurance for those children over four whose parents can not afford insurance for them. The panel recommends paying for it with extra taxes on alcohol and tobacco. When we come back, the American Agenda : falling through the safety net. Commercial break PETER JENNINGS : On the American Agenda tonight : taking away the safety net. There is a study published today which finds that during 1991 more than 40 states, in one way or another, either froze or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cases, they are the deepest cuts in a decade and nowhere are they more severe than in Michigan. This fall, the Michigan state government, faced with a budget deficit, told more than 80,000 people who get some assistance from the state that they should be able to take care of themselves... it 's very hard. Our Agenda reporter is Rebecca Chase. REBECCA CHASE : CU FACES They are not old enough for social security, not sick enough for disability. MOODY They are people like Louis Moody whose lung problems make it impossible for him to practice his trade. LOUIS MOODY : All my life I 've been a metalworker. I love to weld, I like to shape iron. I can do anything with a piece of iron that can be done with it. REBECCA CHASE : ADA AT CAR Most are single adults, poorly educated, with few job skills ; like Ada Prater, whose husband walked out after she raised their five children. ADA PRATER : I just could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHASE : Some have criminal records. Others, drug or alcohol problems. GRAY Many, like Raymond Gray, simply can not find a job. His only income this week came from selling blood. RAYMOND GRAY : I just went to the plasma center the other day and that 's only 10 and that bought something to eat. REBECCA CHASE : SHOTS OF VARIOUS PEOPLE General assistance used to give all these people an average of 140 dollars a month plus food stamps. But in October the checks stopped. SU Michigan was struggling with a one billion dollar deficit. Rather than further cut education or programs to help children or the disabled, the legislature here eliminated welfare for the able-bodied. It is being called a social experiment because no one knows what will happen to all these people cut off.The state director of Social Services defends the cuts, which save 240 million dollars a year. GERALD MILLER / SOCIAL SERVICES DIRECTOR : You always have to look at public policy in the context of the alternatives. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far worse. REBECCA CHASE : NIGHT STREET SCENE The cuts come at a time when temperatures are dropping and unemployment is rising. FOOD LINE Soup kitchens are filled to capacity and there are lines at the homeless shelters. MISSION EXT The unwilling participants in this so-called experiment are facing harsh realities. SHIRLEY JOHNS / HOMELESS ADVOCATE : It 's an insult that people that are in a position of power can experiment with people 's lives. REBECCA CHASE : In fact, many of these people the state considers able-bodied will not be able to support themselves. CU WANT ADS For example, Louis Moody 's age and health are barriers to his employment. CLEANING He works as a janitor now but a part-time minimum wage job is not enough to live on. TO LOUIS Do you have any money in your pocket? LOUIS MOODY : I think I 've got a dime : one dime. Fifty-four years old and I 've got one dime. REBECCA CHASE : ADA AT SHREDDER Ada Prater is also 54. She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. She is in a training program that provides temporary part-time work. Still, she worries she will lose her home. ADA PRATER : I 've lived there for 15 years and my mortgage is two months behind. REBECCA CHASE : Raymond Gray has found that even with education and experience, jobs are scarce. The cuts left him homeless, making it even more difficult to look for work. CALLING FOR JOBS RAYMOND GRAY : I 'm out there every day, you know. I 've got a resume ; everything... College. Worked for the state - Department of Commerce. I do n't know. REBECCA CHASE : Unemployment is now almost 10 percent in Michigan. In a local TV interview, even the Governor, who proposed the cuts, acknowledged the problem. CU CLOSED SIGN INTERVIEWER : Do you know where there are 100,000 jobs available for people that want to work in the state of Michigan this afternoon? GOVERNOR JOHN ENGLER : No. They may not all be in Michigan. Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : MAN ON ROAD WITH SIGN Governor John Engler 's message of " Get a job or leave the state, " has been controversial. PROTEST But officials say they are determined to break the welfare cycle by forcing people to work. GERALD MILLER : Almost one out of eight persons in this state is on some type of public assistance and we have to turn that around. REBECCA CHASE : Michigan is not alone in having to make hard decisions in hard times. Other states are watching to see how the experiment works : whether the thousands of people cut off welfare end up succeeding in jobs or struggling on the streets. MOODY WASHING FLOOR Rebecca Chase, ABC News, Lansing, Michigan. PETER JENNINGS : The American Agenda. We 'll have our final report in a moment. Commercial break PETER JENNINGS : Finally here this evening : how the children see it. It is so often a revelation to adults when children get a chance to explain their perspective on an issue or an event. And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they see things, the rest of us very often benefit from their insight. Do you remember those terrible fires around Oakland, California a couple of months ago? The children do. Here 's ABC 's Brian Rooney. BRIAN ROONEY : FIRES When the Oakland Hills burned, the fire left images in the minds of the children who live here. VOICE OF GIRL : I heard a couple of houses collapse so I went onto my roof and I saw some houses collapse. BRIAN ROONEY : A few days after the disaster an art teacher at the Anthony Chabo Elementary School asked her classes to put their feelings into pictures of the fire. EVAN WITH DRAWING Evan Brooks had lost his home. EVAN BROOKS : Here 's our front yard. Here 's the side, here 's the two side yards. There 's a big tree and... BRIAN ROONEY : Did you like that tree? EVAN BROOKS : Yeah. It was my favorite tree. BRIAN ROONEY : PICTURES The teacher had the children draw with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Museum of Children 's Art in Oakland. LAUREN BARCELON : CU ART It shows how I felt when... I was feeling really bad about my house because everything was gone, all my memories were gone. BRIAN ROONEY : The pictures are filled with flames, helicopters in the air, an oversized fireman. Renee Nakagawa put large animal eyes in the middle of the flames. RENEE NAKAGAWA / STUDENT : I was thinking of the animals that ca n't escape and they 're being burned. BRIAN ROONEY : The teacher says she can see a difference between these pictures and what her students drew before the fire. IRIS POLOS : It 's one thing to do... make a picture of something and it 's another thing to get physically involved and emotionally involved. And that was a real big thing that happened in these pictures. BRIAN ROONEY : CU TEARFUL EYE PICTURE The pictures are not meant to be pretty. They are a reflection of what the children saw and what they think. Brian Rooney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : That 's World News Tonight. I 'm Peter Jennings. Good night.
