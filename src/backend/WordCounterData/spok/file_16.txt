222341 A HOLE IN HIS HEAD @!MIKE-WALLACE-co-h : The medical procedure we 're about to take you through is not new. It was first performed back in the ' 30s, and in a number of places in this country it 's become almost routine. But it is still no less remarkable. A Hole in His Head is about that operation called a pallidotomy, a procedure used to ease the agonies of Parkinson 's disease, the brain disorder that affects millions of people, mainly but not necessarily older people. The operation is not a cure and it is not for every Parkinson 's patient. With the help of British Broadcasting Corporation cameras, which stayed with one patient before, during and after the surgery, Morley Safer went to Bristol, England, to witness the minor miracle that happened to a man named Fred Amphlet. @!Mr-FRED-AMPHLET-@1 : I think eating has become one of the real curses of Parkinson 's disease. @(Footage-of-Fred-ea) @!MORLEY-SAFER-repor : @(Voiceover) Fred Amphlet is 48. He 's had Parkinson 's disease since he was 35 ; first one side of his body, then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you become, the worse it gets, as you will so likely see. @(Footage-of-Fred) @!SAFER : @(Voiceover) This is the best that drugs can do for him. His mind is alert ; his body, an agony of lurching, uncontrollable movement. @!Mr-AMPHLET : She lets me out with my hand out here. It 's causing... @(Footage-of-Fred-at) @!SAFER : @(Voiceover) To give Fred Amphlet this amount of control, barely able to control his body, he must be given 20 injections a day and at least 10 pills every day. Unidentified Woman 1 : Thank you. @!Mr-AMPHLET : OK. Thank you very much. Woman 1 : Bye. @!Mr-AMPHLET : Thank you. Bye. Most of these movements you see, this -- this sort of jigging about, is caused through the drug, not Parkinson 's. But it is -- it is a a side effect of the drug. And this is where the worry comes in. Again, you 're in a catch-two situation -- catch-22 situation, in which you -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!Mr-AMPHLET : @(Voiceover)... to combat the illness, and gradually the -- the side effects outweigh the benefits of the drug. If I do n't take the drugs, I just come to a stop. @(Footage-of-Fred-an) @!SAFER : @(Voiceover) To add to the torment, Fred 's a man who was very active in his job on the Bristol docks and in a number of sports. Now he is totally dependent on his wife, Jill. @!Ms-JILL-AMPHLET-@1 : He 's very conscious when he 's out, people watching him. And, you know, people usually -- frown usually at him because he looks as though he 's drunk because he... @(Footage-of-the-Amp) @!Ms-AMPHLET :... has no walking stick or, you know, things like that. There 's no prop to say, you know, ' This man 's ill. ' @(Photos-shown-of-Fr) @!SAFER : @(Voiceover) This man, once so active -- he played rugger, he sailed, he built his own furniture -- he is now reduced to this. Without drugs, he 's a virtual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorry I took so long. Here you go. @(Footage-of-the-Amp) @!SAFER : @(Voiceover) In Parkinson 's disease, the part of the brain that allows for easy movement shuts down. The body becomes frozen. When he 's like this, Fred can not eat or read or even reach for a drink. The drugs break that spell, but produce something almost as hellish. @(Footage-of-Fred-wa) @!SAFER : @(Voiceover) Fred has reached the end of the line as far as any further medication is concerned. His only hope is an operation called a pallidotomy. @(Footage-of-Gill-lo) @!Dr-STEVEN-GILL-@1D : @(Voiceover) We are offering a surgical treatment where we destroy or neutralize an overactive area of the brain. @(Footage-of-Gill-an) @!SAFER : @(Voiceover) Dr. Steven Gill is a consulting neurologist at de Frenchay Hospital in Bristol, one of a new breed of European and American surgeons who 've been perfecting an old procedure using all the technical tools of the ' 90s. @!Dr-GILL : The surgery is always considered as a last resort. You do n't offer people surgery at the beginning of their disease because surgery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has made a -- a huge difference to Parkinson 's disease, and it 's really those patients that have failed treatment that can be helped by this sort of operation. @(Footage-of-Dr-Gi) @!Dr-GILL : I think that would be a fair statement. @!SAFER : @(Voiceover) The theory is that by destroying a very small part of one overactive area of the brain called the globus pallidus, Fred could be freed of both the frozen and writhing episodes. @!Dr-GILL : OK. @(Footage-of-the-Amp) @!SAFER : @(Voiceover) Because Fred has reached the limit of what drugs can do, @!Dr-Gill has decided he 's a perfect candidate for surgery. @(Footage-of-the-Amp) @!SAFER : @(Voiceover) And finally, the day. Doctors have reduced his medication to a point where he is not quite frozen, where he can still be responsive. The first step is an MRI, magnetic resonance imaging, images of the brain that will become the surgeon 's map. Fred was the most severely stricken patient the surgical team had operated on. @!Dr-Gill decided he must hit targets on both sides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're working on -- on trying to reach a spot the size of -- What? -- a pea or a... @!Dr-GILL : It 's -- it 's... @!SAFER :... a kernel of corn? @!Dr-GILL :... a petit pois, I would say. @!SAFER : A small -- a baby pea. @!Dr-GILL : A small pea, a baby pea. Yes, it -- it 's about -- it 's a lesion, generally, about five millimeters in diameter. @!SAFER : You use the word lesion. What exactly does that mean? @!Dr-GILL : A lesion is a small volume of tissue that you destroy. @!SAFER : Literally burn it up? @!Dr-GILL : You -- you -- you burn a small volume of t -- of tissue. @(Footage-of-Amphlet) @!SAFER : @(Voiceover) First, a metal frame is attached. It will both keep him still and act as part of a mathematical instrument, giving the doctor precise external reference points. Then a CAT scan is done, which shows the position of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those white dots on the screen. The pictures are then matched to the MRI images of Fred 's brain. Together, they allow the surgeon to calculate the exact position of the target, the globus pallidus. Anyway, that 's the theory. @!Dr-GILL : This is the globus pallidus, which is seen on the image. And I 'll be passing a needle down to this target. And, really, we have to be accurate to within a millimeter ; otherwise, going too deep by a millimeter will -- will damage his vision. And if I go too much towards the midline by a millimeter, then it could -- could get a paralysis. I do n't think there 's any -- any operation that you would see quite like this. This is an operation where the patient 's awake and responding to you, and you can -- you make a lesion or you destroy a small volume of brain and suddenly things change. It is really quite dramatic and emotional. @!SAFER : For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, yeah. @(Footage-of-the-Amp) @!SAFER : @(Voiceover) Fred is physically and emotionally drained. He 's been on reduced medication for 12 hours so that his body wo n't writhe during the operation. @!Dr-GILL : You are pretty seized up, are n't you? Unidentified Woman 2 : Yeah. OK. @(Footage-of-Dr-Gi) @!Dr-GILL : @(Voiceover) I always find these sort of operations very stressful, more so than many other types of surgery, because potentially you 're near such critical structures that you could cause damage. And, yes, it is a very stressful thing to do. You can make such an extraordinary difference to somebody 's life. Let 's try the right hand and...( unintelligible) and take the index finger... @(Footage-of-surgery) @!SAFER : @(Voiceover) Fred is under only local anesthetic. He must remain fully conscious so that his physical responses, especially sight and movement, can be monitored. @!Dr-GILL : So the cable has got to go to the electrode. It goes into the brain. I use this rather old-fashioned tool because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it 's slightly less disconcerting. Unidentified Man : You have to... @!Dr-GILL : Yeah. @!SAFER : @(Voiceover) The electrode is adjusted so that its tip will hit the target. @!Dr-GILL : Now we 're in post-electrode. @!SAFER : @(Voiceover) Because it is blunt, it pushes through the soft brain tissue without damaging it. The brain also does not feel any pain. @!Dr-GILL : OK. Ca n't feel anything, can you, Fred? @!Mr-AMPHLET : I ca n't feel a thing, no. I ca n't feel a thing at all. @!Dr-GILL : We 'll hear a lot of whistling noises now. @!SAFER : @(Voiceover) Before destroying the target, the team checks the location of the electrode tip by stimulating it and watching Fred 's reaction. @!Dr-GILL :... going. Yeah, he 's got the twitching in the right side of his face. Same again. Just check the speech because we 're on the dominant hemisphere. @!SAFER : @(Voiceover) Any changes in vision, speech or movement would indicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah. That was spasm. Not... Unidentified Man 1 : What did -- what did he feel then? @!Mr-AMPHLET : It felt like spasm. Man 1 : Spasm. @!SAFER : @(Voiceover) This spasm is just what they 're looking for. It means they are on target. As the temperature rises the electrode begins to destroy the target brain tissue. After 90 seconds, the procedure 's over. The surgeons look for improvement, but Fred is so exhausted it 's almost impossible to tell. @!Dr-GILL : It seems to be faster on the right though, is n't it? Man 1 : See -- just try and keep up as fast as you can. Just take and... @(Footage-of-surgica) @!Dr-GILL : After the left-sided lesion, Fred had just had enough. He was just very, very tired and really quite uncomfortable, I think, and so we decided to call it a day. @(Footage-of-Amphlet) @!Ms-AMPHLET :... heat, love? @!Mr-AMPHLET : Yeah. @!Ms-AMPHLET : Yeah. @!SAFER : @(Voiceover) @!Dr-Gill still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain. The first operation was a success, but there were still tremors on the left side. @(Footage-of-second-) @!SAFER : @(Voiceover) Six weeks later Fred was well enough to come back. This time @!Dr-Gill leaves Fred on full medication. It makes the surgery more demanding, but it allows the team to observe the writhing on his left side. If it ceases, it will tell them immediately whether the operation 's been a success. @!Dr-GILL : Just on the left side? Unidentified Man 2 : Left side. @!Dr-GILL : Just the left side of the shoulder, OK. @!SAFER : @(Voiceover) The target 's been located on the right side of the brain, and the electrode goes in. @!Dr-GILL : You feel anything at all? @!SAFER : @(Voiceover) Ninety seconds later, target destroyed. All eyes are on Fred 's left arm. Man 2 : Just let it rest. @!Dr-GILL : How 's it going, my old friend? @(Footage-of-Amphlet) @!SAFER : @(Voiceover) For the first time in years, Fred Amphlet 's body is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on for that much longer now, OK? @!Mr-AMPHLET :...( Unintelligible). @!Dr-GILL : Can you sit yourself up there, Fred? Head up, please. Man 2 : Head up. @!Mr-AMPHLET : Just like that. So, finally... @!Dr-GILL : Bloody marvelous. How you doing, Fred? @!Mr-AMPHLET : Not bad at all. @!Dr-Gill : Very good. Unidentified Woman : See you, Fred. @(Footage-of-Fred-an) @!Dr-GILL : @(Voiceover) Fred has a very advanced disease. He was one of the worst cases that I 've had to operate on. I think that the major thing he 's going to see is he 's going to be functioning much better. He 's going to be able to do things that he could n't do before. I hope he 's going to be able to sleep at night and have a fairly normal existence, be able to feed himself and re -- really, a changed man. A new man. @!Ms-AMPHLET : Oh, God, tom... @!Mr-AMPHLET : Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got all worried that you were so long. I got all panicky and doodle and scribbled pictures. I was worried. @!Mr-AMPHLET : Sit down, sit down. @!Ms-AMPHLET : Oh, no, you sit down. @!Mr-AMPHLET : No, I do n't want to sit down. @!Ms-AMPHLET : Oh, that 's lovely. Oh, thanks ever so much. @!Dr-GILL : OK, OK. @!Ms-AMPHLET : Thank you from the bottom of my heart, thank you. @!Dr-GILL : All right. @!Ms-AMPHLET : I prayed like mad for you all. @!Dr-GILL : Yeah. He 's done well. He 's done well. @(Footage-of-the-Amp) @!Dr-GILL : @(Voiceover) I think Fred is a remarkable man. He is extremely determined. And despite all the enormous difficulties this disease brings on people, he 's continually striving to make the very best he can, which is extraordinary. I think a lot of people would have given up a long time ago. @(Footage-of-Amphlet) @!SAFER : @(Voiceover) Giving up is not Fred Amphlet 's style. A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rugby team 's colors, mixing it up with his mates. @!Ms-AMPHLET : Well done, anyway. Yeah. @!Mr-AMPHLET :...( Unintelligible) on your lip....( Unintelligible) fruit juice... @!Ms-AMPHLET : Fruit juice, yeah. @!WALLACE : Fred Amphlet is still on medication, but the doses have been massively reduced. As we said, the surgery is not a cure for Parkinson 's and it is not for every patient.
