4026541 ROBERT @!SMITH, host : This is TALK OF THE NATION. I 'm Robert Smith in Washington. You know, I think we 've been rock-and-roll heroes in our own minds. As a kid, perhaps you also played air guitar riffs and sung into hairspray bottles instead of a microphone. Well, some may outgrow the fantasy of performing in a rock band, others nurture it. In Portland, Oregon, there 's a camp where girls age 8 to 18 have one week to learn how to play electric guitars, bang drums, write lyrics and generally learn how to rock out in a band. Filmmakers Arne Johnson and Shane King spent a week trailing some girls that despite tears and grumbling would rather be in the band than with the band. @(Soundbite-of-docum) @!LAURA : Yeah, well, I know people in this band, I know people in this band and they 're like, talking about how their friends with all these in bands, why do n't you start your own band, super genius, you know what I mean? That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!SMITH : That 's 15-year-old Laura, one of the girls featured in the documentary, " Girls Rock! " We 'll have the - you have to read it that way, " Girls Rock! " We 'll have the director and one of the stars on today. If you have questions about Rock ' n Roll Camp for Girls or if you were or ever have been or have a girl who rocks, our number here in Washington is 800-989-8255. Our e-mail address is talk@npr.org, and you can also comment on our blog. It 's at npr.org/blogofthenation. And Arne Johnson, co-director of " Girls Rock! " joins us from Palentine(ph) Recording Studios in Portland, Oregon. Welcome to the show. @!Mr-ARNE-JOHNSON-@1 : Thanks a lot. @!SMITH : Is that Palentine, Palantine(ph)? @!Mr-JOHNSON : Palatine. I... @!SMITH : Palatine. @!Mr-JOHNSON :...( Unintelligible) that sounds right. @!SMITH : There you go. Why did you choose to make a documentary about a rock-and- roll girls camp? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big fan of this band Sleeter Kinney and I heard Carrie Brownstein who 's a member of that band who teaches at the camp just about every year. Marissa can answer this more accurately how long she 's been doing that but she co-wrote the songs that 's the sort of camp theme song. And I heard her talking about the camp and it was a very inspiring speech. Somebody had asked her if there 's any future for rock and roll and she was like, I 've seen 9-year-olds create noise(ph) pop masterpieces and I know there 's future for music. And as soon as I heard that, you know, the idea of this somebody of Carrie Brownstein 's stature teaching little girls how to rock out was something I wanted to find more about. @!SMITH : Well, you gave away our surprise. Sitting next to him is Marisa Anderson. She 's an artistic director and instructor at Rock ' n Roll Camp for Girls and she also joins us from Palatine Recording Studios in Portland, Oregon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nice to be here. @!SMITH : Well, so what brought you to Rock ' n Roll Camp for Girls? @!Ms-ANDERSON : I came to rock camp as a volunteer. In 2004, the band that I have been playing in ended and I was looking for a way to spend my time still playing music but staying home instead of being on tour all the time. And I started as a volunteer, became an instructor and, yeah, now I 'm the artistic director. @!SMITH : How early did you start playing an instrument? You play an instrument or... @!Ms-ANDERSON : I do. I play many instruments. I started playing music when I was 7 years old. @!SMITH : It was n't rock and roll or were you put you through sort of... @!Ms-ANDERSON : No. @!SMITH :... classical music training? @!Ms-ANDERSON : I was playing classical music from about the age of 7 until about the age of 19. I dropped out of college. I was in classical guitar studies. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was the music that I needed to be playing. @!SMITH : When you were practicing classical music, did you ever sneak into a closet and do some power chords during your teenage years or was this foreign to you? @!Ms-ANDERSON : I tried. I tried to play some Led Zeppelin riffs. I had a book, you know, because I could read music and I found out that reading Led Zeppelin notation does not make you sound like Jimmy Page. @(Soundbite-of-laugh) @!SMITH : It sounds like you needed a rock-and-roll camp, a little earlier in life. @!Ms-ANDERSON : I did. I needed a place to go where whatever I wanted to do musically was encouraged. @!SMITH : Well, Arne Johnson, were you the only - you and Shane, your co-director also a man, we 're you the only men at the camp during this filming and - I mean, you have these sort of girl empowerment scene and you got two guys at the camera, I mean, how were you greeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain amount of wariness when we first approached the camp about the idea but they, you know, really never brought up gender to us. And maybe Marissa can talk about more what their conversations were internally but we, you know, they were just worried about the camera, basically. They were worried about how we we 're going to disrupt the camp and make it hard for the girls to focus on their important work. @!SMITH : Come on, blocking up the media is an important part of rock-and-roll studies. @(Soundbite-of-laugh) @!Mr-JOHNSON : Yeah, that 's right. Well, and they do a great job with it. I mean, the awesome thing is once they got over the idea of there 's a camera here, I mean, they had way more important stuff to do. They were going to perform in front of 750 people, a song they were writing and we were highly insignificant compared to that, honestly. @!SMITH : Marissa, when these girls come to the camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what they want to do? Or is this a little bit of a journey of discovery for them as they 're there? @!Ms-ANDERSON : I 'd say both of those things are true because we are a self- esteem program for girls that uses music as our means. @!SMITH : Well, that does n't sound as much fun as rock-and-roll camp. @!Ms-ANDERSON : It does n't but it actually is more fun. One of the ways that we do that is all the girls have to write their own songs. All the bands that perform perform songs they 've written that week. And that creates a dynamic where you might be like, yeah, I love death metal, I love it and I 'm going to play it and - but then when you start to write your own song maybe like what your band is feeling or what your feeling comes out as a power ballad, like, who knows. So even if kids have strong musical taste and musical opinions, sort of the group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a compromise but with like the vision of the whole. @!SMITH : Do girls seem intimidated by the rock-and-roll world? I mean, are they there because they feel like there 's not a natural course for them to get into this or maybe that society tells them that they should be practicing classical scales instead of power chords and screaming and drums? @!Ms-ANDERSON : I think that by now, I mean, the camp has been in action since 2001 and enough girls have gone through the program and there has been enough media attention on it that I think that girls come in knowing its their space. And also even if they did n't know it before they got there, once they walk in, it 's pretty clear by the layout of the building and the stuff on the walls and just sort of the general aspect of the place. @!SMITH : We 're talking about rock-and-roll girls camp. We 'll get to you in just a second, Arne, but we wanted to speak to - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!JUSTINE-@1Caller@2 :( Unintelligible) How are you? @!SMITH : Go ahead, Justine. @!JUSTINE : I just love the idea of the camp. If I was 17, I would be there. I have started my own first band when I was 45 - I 'm 47 now - with my friend, Mary(ph). We both love punk rock and there was so much old music that was out there that was n't being played so we started a band and it 's been really a highlight of my life. It 's not only empowering but it 's just - I just look forward to writing, paying, hanging out with my band, playing in front of the young people that do n't know about the music. And I 've got to say it 's - I 'm just totally behind it and it has really changed my life. @!SMITH : Well, thanks, Justine. Let 's go now to Hope(ph). Hope calls us from Redding, California. Hey, Hope. Hope, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Okay. Hello. I am Hope Rogers(ph). I went to rock camp two years ago. @!SMITH : Really? How old are you, Hope? @!HOPE : Eleven. @!SMITH : Eleven. How was the camp? @!HOPE : It was really fun. I got a lot better at guitar, like they taught me a lot and it was - and I was on stage there for the second time, it was really cool. @!SMITH : What kind of rock do you play? And what kind of instrument? @!HOPE : I play guitar. @!SMITH : Uh-huh. And what kind of music do you like? @!HOPE : Just rock, like my favorite band is The Beatles. @!SMITH : There you go. A wise band. And so would you - had you had any experience before you went to rock camp? @!HOPE : Yeah. I had played for like one year before. @!SMITH : Is this one of those things that parents encourage their kids to go to or did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!HOPE : No. My aunt found it in a magazine and he called my mom and sent the magazine to her. And my mom showed me about it and then we applied and we had to wait and wait and wait for a long time but we got in, me and my sister. @!SMITH : So do you still keep it up? Do you play in a band and try to do - to write music and such? @!HOPE : Well, I do n't - I 'm not in a band and I write music sometimes - it 's not very good. But, yeah, I 'm still playing. @!SMITH : What do you think, Marisa. Is this a common story? @!Ms-ANDERSON : I think it 's a common story, yeah. Girls come for a year or two years and then go home and, you know, kids are really busy right now, and there 's so many activities. But once you have a little music foundation, you can come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your life. And I 'd also like to address what the previous caller, I think, Justine said, and - we have ladies rock camps too. The biggest fundraiser that we hold every year is our ladies rock camp weekend. We hold three of them. And it 's for women who wish that they were a camp for them when they were girls and they 'd get the same curriculum. We run them through the same program but it 's condensed - it 's a weekend instead of a week. So any ladies out there who are hearing this and wishing... @!SMITH : It 's not too late. @!Ms-ANDERSON : It 's not - it 's never too late. I think the oldest ladies rock camper we ever had was 67. @!SMITH : Absolutely. @!Ms-ANDERSON : And it 's her first time playing the bass. @!SMITH : Arne Johnson, who 's co-director of the documentary " Girls Rock! " did you have a tough time getting young women to tell their stories to you or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at rock camp? @!Ms-JOHNSON : Well, you know, we went and met a lot of the girls before rock camp. We interviewed them. We traveled around the country and interviewed them beforehand. And so we had a chance to really kind of get to know them and hear some of the things that they were thinking about and why they were going to camp. And one of the cool things that started to happen when you asked earlier about us being two guys on the film and one of the things that started to happen that was kind of interesting was that when the girls would, you know, for those who have n't seen the film yet, as Marissa mentioned, it 's not just about music ; it 's also about a lot of issues that girls confront in their lives. And one of the things that started to happen is girls would say something in passing like we 're talking to Laura, I mean, she was like, you know, boys would n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and she started to move on, like you know what I mean. And we had to keep saying, well, Laura, actually we do n't know what you mean, like we 're boys, please explain to us. And I felt like the girls started to get really excited as if they were sort of our tour guides into what it was like to be a girl in this era. And I think after a while that became a really special energy that we - that the film itself really became about that. @!SMITH : We 're talking about rock-and-roll girls camp. Thanks for your phone call, Hope. You 're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. Let 's speak with John(ph) now. John is calling us from Waterford, Michigan. @(Soundbite-of-baby-) @!SMITH : How 's it going, John? I hear a baby in a background rocking out. @!JOHN-@1Caller@2 :( Unintelligible). I just wanted to thank the other guest for going in and sharing their stories. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an intense fan of the Foo Fighters, and I just can not wait to get her into something like this. And I hope this exist when she 's four, I think, it 's going to be a fantastic experience. @!SMITH : Well, it sounds like the Foo Fighters are playing in the background or at least some sort of fighting, so I 'm going to let - drop this phone line but let 's - I did want to ask our two guests. You know, you speak of self-empowerment and it 's certainly comes out of rock and roll, but is it actually overt at the camp? I mean, do you actually have sessions where you talk specifically about empowerment and that sort of thing or is that just one of the byproducts of rocking out? @!Ms-ANDERSON : We have workshops during the week of camp. One of the workshops that every camper goes through is called Image and Identity. And it 's about deconstructing media images of girls and talking about issues that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their parents. And then we also do - every session of camp creates a zine and they make, you know, every girl is responsible for a page and there 's always a topic like things I hate or things I love. And it 's a forum for them to get to talk about whatever is on their mind. And we also have self-defense workshops for every girl that comes through, so they learn that physical self skills to keep themselves safe. @!SMITH : How interesting. @!Ms-ANDERSON : I think... @!Mr-JOHNSON : I think what - oh, sorry. Robert, I was going to add that one of the things we really observed too was that the self-esteem stuff is really interwoven in the music because part of what happens with rock and roll and why girls are often hesitant to do it is that a lot of it is very loud - and in the movie, Carrie Brownstein talks about how you should never underestimate the power of volume and hearing your voice echo throughout a room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and making these noises and being encouraged to( unintelligible) from the camp talks a lot about how girls are afraid to hit the drums hard enough to make enough to make enough noise. So once you get the girls hitting the drums, you 're also, you know, making them, you know, understand how to make great rock and roll but they 're also beginning to take up more space and feel like they can do anything that they want to and so we watch that kind of thing happen over and over again while we were there. @!SMITH : Let 's speak with Lisa(ph). Lisa is in Beaverton, Oregon. @!LISA-@1Caller@2 : Hi. @!SMITH : Go ahead, Lisa. @!LISA : Hi. I am the mother a 5 and 7-year-old daughters who really take to this sort of a thing. I notice that in kind of every venue of musical expression, but I have a 7-year-old who has been creating her own compositions for years and she 'll sing the same composition of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then move on to another one. @!SMITH : And it sort of brings up the question for girls who ca n't get to the rock camp. What are both of your suggestions, quickly, for - can you encourage rock at home? @!Ms-ANDERSON : You can. And I wanted to say there 's more rock camps than just the Portland one. We are part of an alliance called the Girls Rock Camp Alliance. And there are - there 's a camp in New York, in South Carolina, in Chicago, in Philadelphia. There 's one starting in New York and there 's one starting in London. And I think there 's more and there 's - if you go to our Web site, it will talk about all the different areas in the country where you can find girls rock camps. @!Mr-JOHNSON : Marissa 's also co-edited or edited a book that 's coming out called " The Rock ' n Roll Camp for Girls " book out of Chronicle Books and it will be out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Indie Girl " which is several kinds of creative projects, one of which is forming a band but also making a zine and all that kind of stuff too. So they are definitely I think the camp has really inspired a lot of people to create more resources beyond the camp for girls. @!SMITH : So Arne, what did you learn when you were spending all this time both at the camp and editing your documentary? @!Mr-JOHNSON : Well, I think for me one of the biggest learning experiences was, you know, I grew up in a, you know, a very strongly political family and my mother was, you know, a feminist and really thought us how to, you know, to think about sexism and it was, you know, so for a long time, I had it really kind of instinctive, more political feeling about women 's place in society. And I think that the first interview where we sat down with, you know, a 15-year- old girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affecting them on a visceral level that, you know, what is was like seeing, like Laura told us, you know, she looks around and she sees no one in media that looks like her. And to hear that that 's not just stupid or it 's not just a drag but it actually is causing young girls a lot of pain to see that was a truly transformational experience for me. And then also seeing how the magic of the camp so quickly lifted that feeling for these girls who was often overwhelming... @!SMITH : Thank you very much, Arne Johnson is co-director of " Girls Rock! " and Marisa Anderson is artistic director and instructor at Rock ' n Roll Camp for Girls. This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I 'm Robert Smith. '
