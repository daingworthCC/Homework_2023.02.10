After a series of deadly attacks on Easter Sunday, there was a new explosion in the capital Colombo just a short time ago. This latest blast followed a string of suicide bombings targeting Christians celebrating Easter. The Sri Lankan government says they were carried out by a local group of Muslim radicals. The bombing killed at least two hundred and ninety people and wounded hundreds more. U.S. officials say several Americans are among the dead. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Sri Lanka 's health minister says warnings from intelligence agencies were not followed. The terrorists targeted three churches and three luxury hotels in nearly simultaneous attacks on Easter Sunday morning. Elizabeth Palmer is in Colombo, the capital near one of the bombers ' targets yesterday. Elizabeth, good morning on this terrible day in Sri Lanka. @1ELIZABETH-PALMER@2 @5CBS-News-Senior-Fore@7 : Indeed. I 'm standing right in front of the first church to be bombed yesterday, St. Sebastian. And as I was talking down here, about half an hour ago to talk to you, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It -- we do n't know about casualties yet, but witnesses say that police had spotted a suspicious van and when the bomb squad turned up to try and defuse what turned out to be a bomb inside, it went off. Just a short time ago, the Sri Lankan government, as you said, has accused this local homegrown Islamist extremist group Thowheed Jamaath of carrying out yesterday 's bombings. And specifically they said that the group sent seven suicide bombers to do the deed, all of them Sri Lankan. @5Begin-VT@6 @1ELIZABETH-PALMER@2 : The church clock of St. Anthony here in Colombo, the minute it was hit. Now forensic teams are combing through the debris, looking for evidence. Yesterday, Sri Lankan special forces carried out raids in the capital and three officers died. But by this morning, the government announced twenty-four men were under arrest. Yesterday 's attack was coordinated and of unprecedented cruelty. It left landmark churches in ruins and killed or maimed scores of Roman Catholics. What should have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has left overwhelming grief. At the three hotels that were bombed, Sri Lankans and tourists alike died as they gathered for Easter brunch. Colombo 's Mayor Rosy Senanayake : @1ROSY-SENANAYAKE@2 @5Colombo-Mayor@6 : This is a very sad moment. This is a very cowardly attack, and it 's a -- it 's not just an attack. It 's a very gross gruesome attack on humanity. @1ELIZABETH-PALMER@2 : A civil war between Buddhist and Hindu Sri Lankans raged here for thirty years and suicide bombs were a common weapon, but that war ended in 2009 and Sri Lankans believed the worst of the violence was over. They were wrong. In Colombo, police are everywhere today. Normally crowded streets are quiet and schools remain closed in a country both stunned and fearful. @5End-VT@6 @1ELIZABETH-PALMER@2 : They are afraid, but they are also angry as I came through the streets here after that most recent bomb went off. People poured out of their houses suddenly and they mobbed soldiers who were trying to get through on motorcycles. There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of violence in this country. The government is very nervous that things could explode. Norah. @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : Well, it looks that way this morning. Elizabeth Palmer in Sri Lanka. Thank you. John Miller is New York City 's deputy police commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. He 's also our former senior correspondent. John, good morning. You just heard Elizabeth Palmer describe it as a tense situation there that controlled explosion as well as Sri Lankan police finding eighty-seven bomb detonators at a bus station this morning. What are you hearing from your intelligence counterparts? JOHN MILLER( NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and Counterterrorism) : Well, from the time this started in about four-something in the morning yesterday, Chief Tom Galati, chief of intelligence, Chief James Waters from counterterrorism, the wheels started turning in New York about getting information about what they were seeing there. And what we heard, we did n't like, which is a complex, multi-location attack that was very well organized. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here against any similar targets. @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : You do n't like the idea of a complex multi-destination because it suggests an outside force outside of the country? @1JOHN-MILLER@2 : I think when you look at this and you see seven or eight locations off the bat in near simultaneous staggers with then other later ones, then raids on places where suspects set off bombs, what you 're looking at is the kind of operation that would take a great deal of organization, a -- a good deal of funding, and more importantly a fairly large number of people for your average -- @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : Mm-Hm. @1JOHN-MILLER@2 : -- terrorist plot, which increases operational security. How did they run this for so long with so much planning and so many wheels turning without -- @1GAYLE-KING@2 :( INDISTINCT) get out -- @1JOHN-MILLER@2 : -- without being on -- without it being found. Exactly, Gayle. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : But -- but then there 's word that the government had been told something ten days ago that there could be an attack on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it, did n't take it seriously? @1JOHN-MILLER@2 : Well, they did put out a notice to other government officials, warning that they were taking this seriously and that the threat itself touched a number of important other investigations. So -- and we 've seen this here in the United States, Gayle. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Mm-Hm. @1JOHN-MILLER@2 : That 's one of those things that -- and I think the government had the right take on it. Let 's figure out who did it and get them first and then let 's look at our -- our own processes after, and that 's what they 've said they 're going to do. @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : As you can see this morning, they 're worried about more attacks coming and so the Sri Lankan government shut down all social media, Facebook, WhatsApp, some other social media sites that are used there in Sri Lanka. Does that help the situation, do you believe, that they took? @1JOHN-MILLER@2 : You know, it 's hard to second-guess them from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sends a chill up a -- a Democratic government. But their stated reason was to prevent misinformation, and we 've seen a lot of discussions since they did that about -- I believe the headline in -- in one major newspaper was, you know, the -- the tensions are the heat and social media could be the match. @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : Oh. @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : John, you -- we 've been talking about lone wolves for the last period of time when we talked about terrorism. But this sense of coordination, does that put in mind for you any particular organization? @1JOHN-MILLER@2 : So, I think we have to ask ourselves a couple of questions. Well, let 's -- let 's make it three. Number one, is this the resurgence of al Qaeda, which has been expanding its network to pick up these affiliates? Because it is certainly more their style. Number two, is this an ISIS- influenced group? When ISIS has gone from being a caliphate, gone from being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group. And number three, is this a local group that has grown in sophistication and -- and -- @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : Might have international wings. @1JOHN-MILLER@2 : -- and com -- and complexity? @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : Right. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : The three churches and luxury hotels. Does that say anything to you? @1JOHN-MILLER@2 : It certainly does. It certainly says this was a attack directed against Christians specifically with a tinge of economic targets. They want to strike at a given religion and I think we 've been waiting for that shoe to drop since the attack on the mosques in New Zealand in that both on the 15th for ISIS and on the 18th for al Qaeda, their leaders have called on all the affiliate groups to do an attack in revenge for that. @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : Okay. @1JOHN-MILLER@2 : And I 'm -- I 'm -- that is speculation there, but it 's certainly something we have to look at. @1NORAH-O'DONNELL@2 : Got it. @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : All right. John Miller. Thanks so much for being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sri Lanka during his Easter Mass in Vatican City. The pontiff addressed around seventy thousand people in St. Peter 's Square yesterday. He condemned the cruel violence and grave attacks on Sri Lankan churches and hotels. The pope 's message also addressed conflicts around the entire world. He called on political leaders to put aside their differences and work for peace.
