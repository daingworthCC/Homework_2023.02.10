4026941 MICHEL @!MARTIN, host : I 'm Michel Martin, and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. A good-hearted but down-on-his-luck dreamer is on the brink of disaster. His only hope seems to be in one big night, one big pay day, and he just can not figure out how to make it work. Just when all seems lost, a surprising turn just might allow his dream to come true. That 's been a standard Hollywood storyline since the early days of film, but " Honeydripper " is anything but your standard Hollywood movie. Set in the cotton fields of Jim Crow Alabama, " Honeydripper " mixes music with an honest look at the daily humiliations of life endured by African-Americans in the segregated South. " Honeydripper " is up for two prizes tonight at the NAACP Image Awards. The film is the latest project of independent filmmaker John Sayles and his producer and life-partner, Maggie Renzi. They join me in our studio to talk about " Honeydripper " and, hopefully, a bit about themselves. Welcome. Thanks for coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Honeydripper ") : Hello. Ms. MAGGIE RENZI( Producer, " Honeydripper ") : Nice to be here. @!MARTIN : John Sayles, you wrote this film. How did this story come to you? Mr. SAYLES : You know, it was rattling around in my head for quite a long time. It 's inspired, not based, on a short story that I wrote that 's in my last story collection, " Dillinger in Hollywood. " And I think it came out of just a long experience with American music, which comes up from the South, and thinking about that sea change that happened when that solid-body electric guitar showed up and an awful lot of people who played music had to either get on board or get left behind. @!MARTIN : " Honeydripper " is about a lot of things. It 's about race. It 's about change. It 's very much about music, and I want to tell a little bit about the story. Danny Glover plays a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Purvis, and here 's a scene where I think he talks about what music can mean. Let 's play it. qwq @( Soundbite-of-film, Mr. DANNY GLOVER( Actor) :( As Tyrone Purvis) See this old boy there, the first one, he know how to play all of them kinds of African instruments. I mean, he could play mud if you give him a key and a tempo. Yeah, he 's got music in his head and in his heart. In every damn piece of him, there 's music. And one day, master 's away, and he alone in that room with that piano. Mr. CHARLES DUTTON( Actor) :( As Maceo) Yeah, watch out now. Mr. GLOVER :( As Purvis) And he goes over, and he sits down on the bench, and he spreads his fingers over it the way he 's seen many a white player do, and he thinks... qwq @( Soundbite-of-music Mr. GLOVER :( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me. I could do some damage with this thing. @!MARTIN : That was Danny Glover, and the other voice you heard was that of Charles Dutton. How did that scene come to you? It 's a remarkable image. Mr. SAYLES : I started thinking about that very scene. And when I was thinking about scene - well, who was the first guy? You know, there was in Civil War days, there was a guy named Blind Tom who was a slave, and he played classical music. And it was like he was from outer space or something for people then, but he was just a musician, you know, and he had a great ear and he could play. American music, I think, is the place where Americans meet first, where ethnic groups meet first, where racial groups meet first. Before they can even look each other in the eye, they 're listening to each other 's music. @!MARTIN : Do you play? Mr. SAYLES : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but music talks to me, all kinds of music. @!MARTIN : Maggie, talk to me about the plot. Tell me a little bit more about the plot for those who have n't seen it. Do n't give all the good stuff away. Ms. RENZI : I wo n't give the good stuff away, but in a way what you said before, it really describes it. It 's a guy who has got to move forward. He 's got to change. He has to deal with some demons that have been dogging him, which actually, as it happens, has to do with a guitar player he killed as a young man. We do n't know that for a while. And there 's a spirit, the spirit of the Blues, who 's played Keb'Mo ', a character John calls Possum, who 's a blind guitar player who turns up to taunt him and to provoke him into making this change. He has what 's one of my favorite lines in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player to come and change his life. qwq @( Soundbite-of-film, @!KEB'MO-@1Musician, :( As Possum)( As Purvis) You waiting on somebody? qwq @( Soundbite-of-music Ms. RENZI : And Keb'Mo 's character says nothing on that train 's gon na change your luck, Tyrone. qwq @( Soundbite-of-film, @!KEB'MO ' :( As Possum)... gon na change your luck, Tyrone. You 're going to have to save your own self. Mr. GLOVER :( As Purvis) What do you know about anything? @!KEB'MO ' :( As Possum) Oh, nothing much, but I know you from way back. @(Soundbite-of-music) @!Ms-RENZI : And there 's a lot of times where we 've been making this movie and going around and promoting it, because we 're releasing it ourselves, that I keep thinking Maggie, nothing in this - on that train is going to change your life. You 've got to change it by yourself. @(Soundbite-of-laugh) @!MARTIN : I want to talk more about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 're doing. But before we talk about the business, I want to talk about the movie itself. A lot of the - the typical Hollywood movie has like the hero, and the other characters kind of revolve around that hero, and in " Honeydripper " and many of your movies, it 's really more about the community. This is, like, your 16th film, and many of them have that sort of quality of everybody 's important. Why do you do it that way? @!Mr-SAYLES : Well, I think it 's how I see the world. You know, I do n't see it in heroic terms. Also, I was an actor before I was a writer or director, and one of the first things an actor does is you say how does my character see the world? When I write a screenplay, I read it over, the first draft, and I read every part as if I had to play it. And then you say well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, what would make me a more three-dimensional person? What I always tell my actors is I do n't care if you 've only got two pages, we should feel like the camera could follow you off screen and have a total movie that could happen there that would be interesting. I think who we are is partly, you know, when we grew up, where we grew up, who we grew up with, our place in the community, and we do n't have a personality other than that. You know, we 're not little islands. @!MARTIN : You 've got some - Maggie, you 've got some amazing people in this film. You 've got, you know, Danny Glover, Charles Dutton, Lisa Gay Hamilton, Keb'Mo ', and I 'm not trying to get into your business, but I 'm assuming - I do n't know, but I 'm assuming - you ca n't pay them what they could get for like a " Lethal Weapon. " Ms. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just wondering how you managed to do that. Ms. RENZI : We do two things. One is that they do n't have to work for us for very long. Anybody who worked for the full shoot only worked for five weeks. We pay everybody the Screen Actors Guild minimum, which is not chump change, but it certainly is far less than Danny could get paid on any good pay day, the same thing with several of the other people who are in the movie. Part of it is that the quality of the material is very high, and word 's out that John Sayles writes really good roles. And, you know, we heard it, you know, over and over again. Usually not only are most movies not ensemble, but if there 's any black people in it, there 's two. Well, this is an almost entirely black cast. @!MARTIN : And they 're the best friend. Ms. RENZI : Yeah, exactly. They 're the best friend. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed or left behind or whatever. @!MARTIN : Or the truth-telling sidekick. Ms. RENZI : You got it. And in this case, no matter where they turned, there was somebody else whose work that they had admired. And it was like an August Wilson play some days, you know, especially because we were there in the Honeydripper Bar a lot of the time. @!MARTIN : And you had - not to give it all away, but as we said that the whole issue here is that Tyrone, Danny Glover 's character, has to save his club, and he 's looking for that big pay day and he 's got to figure out what to do. Then this young fellow comes along, and he 's thinking well, gee, maybe I can get this young guy to, you know - so how did you find him? He 's actually - gives a great performance... Ms. RENZI : He 's great. Gary Clark, Jr. @!MARTIN : Gary Clark, Jr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our friend Lewis Black, not the comedian but the editor of the Austin Chronicle, and he started South by Southwest - when we told Lewis the story, he said oh, then you 've got to come see Gary Clark, who was rocked in the cradle of Austin music since he was 12 years old when he started playing the guitar. So when we went to see Gary at the Continental Club there, he had just turned 21, and he was great. And there just are n't that... @!MARTIN : So he 's not really an actor? Ms. RENZI : No. @!MARTIN : He does n't see himself as an actor. He sees himself primary as a musician. Ms. RENZI : Yeah, he 's a musician. He 's a guitar player, and he plays this kind of music, which is not common for a young African-American man. @!MARTIN : The film does n't shy away from the real abuse that African-American people suffered daily in the South and just, like, conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're not that far away from Reconstruction from slavery, and I just want to play a short clip about that. qwq @( Soundbite-of-movie Mr. GARY CLARK, JR.( Musician, Actor) :( As Sonny) And you 're the piano man? @!Mr-GLOVER :( As Tyrone Purvis)( As character) Piano man, arranger, you name it. Mr. CLARK, JR. :( As Sonny) That must 've been something traveling the country first-class. Mr. GLOVER :( As Purvis) I do n't know about first class, but I seen the country. Mr. CLARK, JR. :( As Sonny) How come you stop? Mr. GLOVER :( As Purvis) I got tired carrying another man 's water, did n't want to die in no colored hotel on some night in who-knows-where, Arkansas, and Delilah.( unintelligible). @!MARTIN : Of course, that was Danny Glover and Gary Clark, Jr. How do you integrate that kind of realism into a film without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see it? Mr. SAYLES : Well, some of it is that dark undertone, and that 's in the movie. But there 's also this thing that people not only survived, they thrived. They had fun. They created culture. They had music. They supported each other. They had families - you know, all of the things that human beings do despite all the odds. They had a gallows humor about the whole thing, and that 's an important part of the story, too. You know, I always say that the first 50-55 years of motion picture history were part of the problem in terms of race relationships. And when they started to turn, the first couple movies it was, you know, " Nobody Knows the Trouble I 've Seen " would play on the soundtrack every time you saw, you know, a black character. Well, there 's another side of that, which was the joyous side, you know, and often it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess what? Life exists when there are no white people around, and that 's a lot of what 's in the movie, is that human ability to live and enjoy life and enjoy each other despite this feeling that 's very low over your head. @!MARTIN : Yeah, which is the power of Saturday night at the juke joint or of Sunday morning in church. And, of course, there were plenty of people who partook of both. If you 're just joining us, you 're listening to TELL ME MORE. We 're speaking with filmmaker John Sayles and his producer and partner, Maggie Renzi, about their latest project, " Honeydripper. " Speaking of race, it 's been a discussion point in at least the last couple of years that I 've noticed, the whole question of who gets to tell whose story - you know, whether as white filmmakers telling a story that centers on the African-American experience, a cross-racial experience, but African-Americans at the center of the story. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storytelling as the filter, as the lens by which the story was told. Mr. SAYLES : Yeah, I 've been doing this since my first novel, you know, which was 1975. So it 's not anything new to me. I feel it 's like the music, which is the music belongs to everybody, and this is America 's story. You know, it 's like, you know, when there first started being, you know, African-American history departments. Well, they only had to have those because the history was not being taught in American history, and it 's absolutely our history. @!MARTIN : Maggie, any thoughts? Ms. RENZI : Well, you know, I think this is a question that 's being asked a lot lately, you know. I mean, we made " The Brother From Another Planet, " which is about a black extraterrestrial in Harlem, he 's specifically the African- American experience. Alfre Woodard plays a character in " Passion Fish. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, we made one of the first really significant movies about lesbians, called " Lianna, " and nobody ever said that we couldn't. @!MARTIN : But I do want to ask, because it 's still a question of some folks feeling that they do n't get a chance to have their say. Ms. RENZI : Listen, anybody - I mean, our chance is a chance that we made. Nobody handed us this chance to say what we say, you know. I think we go to interesting places to try to explore a whole lot of different experiences, and I think behind all of this is a lack of compassion and an assumption that we ca n't understand each other. And across history, literature has been written out by people outside their characters. I find it a really - it 's a conversation that makes me sad because it 's so polarizing. We try hard to make the movies be authentic, be respectful of the communities where we make them, and the response that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for helping to tell our story. @!MARTIN : Maggie, you said something earlier that nobody kind of gave you permission to make these films. That 's true. I mean, the name John Sayles is pretty much synonymous with independent filmmaking. So much has changed since you started. I mean, this used to be something kind of radical and outside the box. Now it 's very well-respected. But is it any easier? Mr. SAYLES : You know, it 's easier to make a movie. Where the bottleneck is is in exhibition and distribution. There 's only 52 weeks in a year. There 's only so many screens that show non-Hollywood things. So there 's a lot of competition, a lot more than when we started 30 years ago. You know, a good thing that 's changed is now it 's not just possible, but it 's actually kind of a cool thing for well-known actors to be in those movies. When we first started, the idea of alternative cinema @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, of we 're going to tell stories that Hollywood 's not going to tell. I 'd say that 85 to 90 percent of the movies that are made outside of Hollywood now are just look at me, do n't you want to hire me? Which is fine. You know, it 's like the minor leagues. They 're making very low-budget versions of what will eventually be Hollywood movies if they 're successful. @!MARTIN : You two have been together for quite a long time. I think you 've collaborated on what, like 13... Ms. RENZI : Thirteen of the 16. @!MARTIN :... of the 16? Ms. RENZI : And we 've lived together since 1973. Mr. SAYLES : Yeah, before many people were born. @(Soundbite-of-laugh) @!MARTIN : Yeah, when dinosaurs walked the earth. Ms. RENZI : Right. @!MARTIN : What 's that like - living together, working together? Ms. RENZI : Oh, it 's good. You know, I think we just keep talking about all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Those are people who met on a film set and then never got to work together again, and you know, they were off in... Mr. SAYLES : Because they were actors. Ms. RENZI :... yeah exotic locales. And we get to go to whatever exotic locale, like Alabama, together and have our adventures together and make new friends together. And it helps, I think. We successfully make these movies together, and we 're proud of them. @!MARTIN : I hope you do n't mind my asking, but to be so involved in the films - this is the first time I 've met you. Does that bother you that you 're less well-known? Ms. RENZI : Thank you for asking, girl. You know, it used to bother me, and then I suppose right around the time when I did n't care anymore, the stories started to be about the John and Maggie Show, and I really like it now that is. People know who work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it happens the way it happens, which is basically a very egalitarian and I hope joyful workplace is what I aim for. And so that 's my distinctive mark on it, and I know that John - you appreciate that as much as I appreciate you as a director. @!MARTIN : Hey, do n't talk for him. Go on - he can speak for himself. Say something nice about her, for God 's sake. Mr. SAYLES : Yeah, I think that one of the advantages that I have is that I have a producer who is on my side. And when I 'm directing, I really have to kind of be caring mostly about what 's in front of the lens. And a lot of what Maggie does is make sure that everything behind it is working. Maggie does it really well, and she also does it making the same movie that I 'm doing. Because so many Hollywood stories are about somebody undermining somebody else and the so- called creative differences and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we just do n't have to deal with that. @!MARTIN : So what 's next for you? Mr. SAYLES : We basically - we financed this movie ourselves, and we 're distributing ourselves. So we have to wait to see how the - if any money comes in, to see if we 're going to make any more movies, which is kind of - that 's the life of an independent, you know, filmmaker. I 'm back to fiction writing, and I 'm writing a novel set during the Philippine-American War from about 1898 to 1903. @!MARTIN : John Sayles and Maggie Renzi are independent filmmakers. Their latest movie, " Honeydripper, " stars Danny Glover, Charles Dutton, Keb'Mo and many others. Thank you both so much for joining us today. Mr. SAYLES : Thanks a lot. Ms. RENZI : My pleasure. @(Soundbite-of-music) @!MARTIN : To take a look at some scenes from " Honeydripper " and find out how you can see it, please go to our Web site at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today. I 'm Michel Martin, and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Happy Valentine 's Day. We hope you get some chocolates. Let 's talk more tomorrow. '
