4023741 OBAMA ' 08 @!STEVE-KROFT-co-ho : A year ago, Barack Obama was even a longer shot to win his party 's nomination than John McCain, but against improbable odds the first-term senator from Illinois defeated Hillary Clinton with a message of change and is now trying to convince the country that he 's ready to lead, running against the record of one of the most unpopular administrations in American history. This is the biggest financial crisis this country has had, a lot of people say, since the Great Depression. Senator BARACK OBAMA : Right. @!KROFT : What caused it? @!Sen-OBAMA- : Well... @!KROFT : Who 's to blame? @!Sen-OBAMA- : Look. There were a lot of factors involved, but I think there is no doubt that if we had had a regulatory system that had kept pace with the changes in the financial system, that would 've had an enormous impact in containing some of the problems that are out there. I mean, you 've got greedy CEOs and investors who are taking too much risk, but that 's why we set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the system as a whole, and unfortunately we had a lot of deregulation and instead of modifying rules for this new economy, we just eliminated them. So we 've got to change our regulatory system. But Steve, there 's a bigger problem and that is that the economy has not been working for ordinary Americans. @!KROFT : Senator McCain made some of the same noises this week, blaming Wall Street greed, promising reform and oversight. What 's the difference between the two of you? @!Sen-OBAMA- : Well, the difference is that I think that I 've got a track record of actually believing in this stuff and you know, Senator McCain, fairly recently said I 'm a deregulator. This is -- one of his top chief economic advisers was Phil Gramm who was one of the architects of deregulation in this sector. And he 's always taken great pride in believing that we have to eliminate regulations. @!KROFT : Really, in some ways, this has been -- this past week has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think that Secretary of the Treasury Paulson has done the right thing? @!Sen-OBAMA- : I think by the time Secretary Paulson and the Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke were looking at these problems, they had no good options left. @!KROFT : Should the government be bailing out all of these banks and insurance companies? @!Sen-OBAMA- : Well... @!KROFT : We 're talking about hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars. @!Sen-OBAMA- : Yeah. I think that our basic principle has to be that you do n't bail out shareholders, you do n't bail out CEOs who are getting golden parachutes and $100 million bonuses, that you are doing everything you can to protect taxpayers, making sure that people are able to stay in their homes and that their mortgages do n't go overboard because of bad decisions that other people make. @!KROFT : Do you think we 're in a recession? @!Sen-OBAMA- : Oh, I think there 's no doubt that we 're going to see when the numbers come out that we are officially in recession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been feeling like we 've been in a recession for years now. When their wages and incomes do n't go up and the cost of gas and groceries and home heating oil and prescription drugs are all going up, that feels awfully like a recession to them. @!KROFT : Do you think the worst is over? @!Sen-OBAMA- : It 's hard to say. @(Footage-of-Elko-N) @!KROFT :( Voiceover) We spoke with Senator Obama on Wednesday in Elko, Nevada, a heavily Republican mining town of less than 20,000 people in a remote corner of this battleground state. Lined with casinos, Basque restaurants and legal brothels, it 's not the kind of place you would expect to find a presidential candidate with 47 days left till the election. But Obama has been here three times, hoping to scrounge a few thousand votes that could help him carry Nevada and put him in the White House. The election is that close. @!Sen-OBAMA- :( From speech) John McCain actually said that if he 's president he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys network in Washington. " I 'm not making this up. This is somebody who 's been in Congress for 26 years. The old boys network. In the McCain campaign, that 's called a staff meeting. Come on. @(Footage-of-Obama-c) @!KROFT :( Voiceover) The Wall Street debacle had stalled the post-convention momentum of Senator McCain and Governor Sarah Palin and brought Obama ' s strongest issue, the economy, back to center stage. And Obama is trying everything he can to keep it there. This is the most aggressive speech I 've seen you give in a while. @!Sen-OBAMA- : Right, right. @!KROFT : What changed? @!Sen-OBAMA- : Well, partly it 's just we 're getting closer to the election. Partly, as you will recall, we, for several weeks, were putting up with a lot of silliness from the other side. Britney Spears ads, we were talking about lipstick and pigs. And one of the things that we felt very strongly was that we had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ours very clear. Hold on one second. Young lady, hold on. Just hold on one second. Let me finish this interview. I 'll be right there. All right, go. @!KROFT : I mean, they 've gotten some traction. @!Sen-OBAMA- : Right. @!KROFT : Particularly with women. Last time I talked to you, Sarah Palin was... @!Sen-OBAMA- : Yeah. @!KROFT :... a name. How did Palin change the race? @!Sen-OBAMA- : You know, look, she 's a skilled politician. I think she was an unexpected choice, which is always fascinating for the media. She sort of came out of nowhere, and so it gave, I think, the McCain campaign some energy, a boost. Over time, people want to know what are the policies. @!KROFT : Hm. @!Sen-OBAMA- : And the policies of John McCain have n't changed since Sarah Palin was named as the vice presidential candidate. I 've got to go. @(Footage-of-Obama-w) @!KROFT :( Voiceover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to find the person who was yelling at him. It turned out to be an African-American woman who wanted to tell Obama that she had just lost her husband of 70 years, and that he had tried to live long enough to vote for him. @!Sen-OBAMA- : Oh, let me give you a hug. I 'm sorry about that. God bless you. I appreciate it. @(Footage-of-Obama-c) @!KROFT :( Voiceover) The candidate was riding a resurgence in the polls, at least for the time being, although they still show a weakness with white working class voters and significant concerns about his lack of executive experience. @!KROFT :( Voiceover) Why do you think you 'd be a good president? @!Sen-OBAMA- : Well, I think that when you think about the challenges we face, these are challenges that require us to look forward and not backwards. When it comes to the economy I think we have to recognize that we 're now in a global economy. How... @!KROFT : Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why do you think you would be a good president? @!Sen-OBAMA- : Well, I was going to get to that. @!KROFT : Go ahead. @!Sen-OBAMA- : The -- I think both by training and disposition, I understand where we need to take the country. @!KROFT : But what is there specifically about you? You mentioned disposition. What skills and traits do you have that would make you a good president? @!Sen-OBAMA- : You know, I 'm a -- I 'm a practical person. One of the things I 'm good at is getting people in a room with a bunch of different ideas who sometimes violently disagree with each other and finding common ground and a sense of common direction, and that 's the kind of approach that I think prevents you from making some of the enormous mistakes that we 've seen over the last eight years. @!KROFT : Suppose you wake up on, you know, the day after the election. @!Sen-OBAMA- : Right. @!KROFT : The president-elect of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, how are you going to govern? @!Sen-OBAMA- : Well, look... @!KROFT : You 've never run anything and now all of a sudden you 're in charge of running the United States. @!Sen-OBAMA- : Look, if the question is executive experience, then Senator McCain and I are on equal footing. If people want to know what I 'm going to do, I 'm going to call in the Joint Chiefs of Staff and I 'm going to tell them we need to find a way to bring this war in Iraq to a close and we want to do it safely and protect our troops, but we are going to get it done because we ca n't keep spending $10 billion a month in Iraq when the Iraqis themselves are n't taking responsibility, and we have to refocus our attention on Afghanistan. The second thing I 'm going to do is we 're going to pull together a working group, including our Treasury secretary and everybody involved in our economy and we are going to make an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do in terms of stabilizing the financial markets and the housing markets? Third thing we 're going to do is we 're going to finally have an energy proposal that is moved through Congress that includes increasing production, but also make sure that we are making this economy more energy efficient. Fourth thing we 're going to do is get moving on a health care plan that finally provides health -- people health insurance at affordable rates. The people who know me, the people who 've worked with -- worked with me and for me understand that I know how to make things run and get things done. Otherwise, I would n't be here sitting having this interview with you. It 's not just because, you know, I can give a good speech once in a while. @(Footage-of-Obama-w) @!KROFT :( Voiceover) Friday in Coral Gables, Obama was surrounded by a financial brain trust that includes three former Treasury secretaries and a former Federal Reserve chairman, who were advising him on the Wall Street crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion dollars to create jobs improving the infrastructure, $150 billion to develop alternative energy sources, and a similar amount for health care. The McCain campaign right now is characterizing you as just another big spending liberal. @!Sen-OBAMA- : Right. Right. @!KROFT : And that as a result of this, he wants to raise taxes. @!Sen-OBAMA- : Right. They 're wrong. And I think they 're being deliberately misleading. Under my tax plan, 95 percent of American workers would get a tax cut, 95 percent. If you are making less than $250,000, you would not see a single dime of tax increase, not on anything. @!KROFT : And at what level would the tax breaks start to kick in? @!Sen-OBAMA- : Well... @!KROFT : Salarywise? @!Sen-OBAMA- : I would say if you 're making $150,000 a year or less, you are definitely getting a tax cut under my plan. Between 150 and 250,000, you 're probably going to stay roughly the same. It is true, if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably pay a slightly higher rate, but you 'll probably still pay lower taxes than you did back in the ' 90s and you definitely will be paying lower taxes than you did under Ronald Reagan. @!KROFT : Is it a good idea to be raising taxes at a time when the country seems to be broke? @!Sen-OBAMA- : Well, keep in mind that we are cutting taxes for 95 percent of the people, who are more likely to spend the money, to go and put that money to work in a small business, who are more likely to give a boost to the economy, a stimulus to the economy at a time when it 's needed. @(Footage-of-operati) @!KROFT :( Voiceover) The most expensive part of the Obama program is the health insurance plan, which would make coverage for children mandatory and promises affordable government subsidized insurance to all Americans, with premiums based on a percentage of their income. How much is it going to cost, $150 billion it 's going to cost, right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is, but we pay for every dime that we propose to spend. I believe in pay as you go. That is you want to propose a new program, you better cut some old ones. If you want to expand a program, then you better figure out where the money 's coming from. @!KROFT : So this is paid for with the increased taxes on people who make more than $250,000 a year? @!Sen-OBAMA- : It 's rolling back the Bush tax cuts, it 's closing corporate tax loopholes, but look, I do n't make a claim that we are going to be able to eliminate our deficit within my first term as president. @!KROFT : Right now it 's what, $400 billion? @!Sen-OBAMA- : It 's a lot. @!KROFT : Right. Is it going to go up under the Obama administration? @!Sen-OBAMA- : No. It 's going to go down, but it 's not going to go away because we 've dug ourselves a deep hole. @!KROFT : Iraq. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February of 2007... @!Sen-OBAMA- : Hm. @!KROFT :... you had proposed at that time a piece of legislation that would 've had all the troops out in 16 months. @!Sen-OBAMA- : Right. @!KROFT : Which means they would 've been out by today, if it would 've been passed. @!Sen-OBAMA- : Right. @!KROFT : We would 've missed the surge, we would 've missed the reduction in violence. @!Sen-OBAMA- : Oh, wait, wait, wait. Steve, I mean, now you 're just engaging in a huge hypothetical. We do n't know what would 've happened if we had initiated the plan that I put forward at the beginning of 2007. And the fact of the matter is that as successful as our troops have been in lowering the violence in Iraq, and they have performed brilliantly, the truth of the matter is, we still do n't have an oil agreement. We still do n't have provincial elections. The commanders on the ground themselves acknowledge that the political progress that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome the reduction in violence, but the notion that somehow this was the only way for us to solve the problem and that the problem has been solved, I completely disagree with. @!KROFT : The McCain campaign, the last day or two, has been running nothing but ads talking about you and the surge. @!Sen-OBAMA- : Yeah, but that 's all that... @!KROFT : That you were opposed to the surge. @!Sen-OBAMA- : That 's all they have to talk about. You notice that according to the McCain mythology, I guess the Iraq War started with the surge. They seem to forget that there were five years before that where they got everything wrong, where they anticipated that we would be greeted as liberators, where they said this would be easy. These are John McCain ' s quotes. That this would all pay for itself because Iraqi oil revenues would more than cover it. I mean, the fact of the matter is is that John McCain has been consistently wrong on Iraq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a close. Even the Iraqi prime minister and the Iraqi government recognize it 's time to have a time frame. The Bush administration has talked about time horizons, and John McCain, moving forward is the only one who stubbornly clings to reasons to stay in Iraq. @(Footage-of-Afghani) @!KROFT :( Voiceover) Obama wants to move an additional 7,000 troops to Afghanistan, where he says the military situation is rapidly deteriorating. You were one of the first people to say that the United States ought to follow the Taliban and al-Qaeda back into the tribal territories to Pakistan. @!Sen-OBAMA- : Here 's what I 've said. We ca n't tolerate al-Qaeda having base camps and safe havens where they are planning attacks against US targets. That 's not acceptable. If we have a high value al-Qaeda target in our sights, then we need to make sure that if the Pakistanis are unwilling or unable to go after them, that we do. That 's common sense. And I think that 's appropriate. @!KROFT : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States? @!Sen-OBAMA- : Yes. I think that a nuclear-armed Iran is not just a threat to us, it 's a threat to Israel and it is a game changer in the region. It 's unacceptable and that 's why I 've said that I wo n't take any options off the table, including military, to prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon. But I do think that is it important for us to use all the arrows in our quiver, and we have not applied the kind of tough diplomacy over the last eight years that I think could have made a difference. @!KROFT : When we come back, the candidates share defining moments that made them who they are today. @(Announcements) '
