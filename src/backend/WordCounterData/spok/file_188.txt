4082341 BRET @!BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR : Congress returns for its lame duck session with expiring tax cuts, the number one issue. Charlie Rangel faces a congressional ethics hearing but not for long. His is among the most popular names in the Republican presidential pool. An in-depth look at Mitt Romney and a possible second presidential run. Live from our studio in Washington, this is SPECIAL REPORT. Good evening. I 'm Bret Baier. The activity level has risen significantly here in Washington with the return of Congress for its lame duck session and the influx of next year 's freshman class. But productivity remains to be seen. Chief political correspondent Carl Cameron looks at people and perspectives, old and new, starting with an attitude adjustment from the Senate 's top Republican. @!CARL-CAMERON-FOX- : Day one on Capitol Hill in the wake of the GOP 's 2010 midterm gains and Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell says he 's listening. He publicly reversed years of opposition to now support a proposed two-year moratorium on so-called earmarks. @!MITCH-MCCONNELL-@1 : Banning earmarks is another small but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're serious. Another step on the way to serious and sustained cuts and spending and to debt. @!CAMERON : The White House on " FOX News Sunday " signaled support for ending earmarks ; those shady spending projects that bypass committees but end up hidden in bills without most lawmakers even being aware of them. @!DAVID-AXELROD-OBA : We are pleased with the movement toward doing away with these earmarks. @!CAMERON : For McConnell, embracing an earmark ban marked the political shift and a political nod for the fiscally conservative Tea Party candidates like Marco Rubio and Rand Paul, and a nod to their newfound influence. @!MCCONNELL : The American people sure have chosen outstanding members to join the United States Senate. @!CAMERON : A pair of Democrats who won special elections were sworn in immediately by the vice president. Delaware 's Chris Coons coasted to win Joe Biden 's old seat. Joe Manchin barely won West Virginia 's open seat in what was otherwise a historic GOP year. On the House Side, Republican Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, founder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina Senator Jim DeMint who recruited some of their winners, welcomed House newcomers. @!MICHELE-BACHMANN-@ : There will be a new sheriff in town and this sheriff is going to listen to the American people. @!CAMERON : Tea Party-backed winners helped make the GOP freshman class one of the biggest ever. Half of new members have no prior experience in elected office on their resumes, but lots on their to-do lists. @!FRANK-GUINTA-@1R@2 : We will make sure that we cut borrowing, that we cut spending, that we cut taxes, that we make sure we get rid of Obamacare. @!CAMERON : But if the White House is signaling a willingness to compromise, Nancy Pelosi appears less so. The liberal, soon to be former House speaker, is ignoring e-mails, conversations and at least two group letters from moderate Democrats urging her to step down as Democratic leader in the wake of the Democrats 2010 defeat. Democrat Heath Shuler of North Carolina, one of the fiscally moderate so-called Blue Dogs, said he would challenge Pelosi for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the votes locked up in advance of Wednesday 's leadership election. @!CAMERON : Pelosi wants to keep the same leadership team that she had in the majority now that she 's in the minority. The problem is when you lose the gavel you are also supposed to lose some seats at the leadership table. So she 's going to have to create a new one. And for South Carolina Democrat Jim Clyburn, she began this weekend referring to him as the assistant leader. Clyburn had been the top vote-counter, the whip in the Senate and the House majority. That job now technically goes to Steny Hoyer because of seniority. So Pelosi 's reference to Clyburn now as the assistant leader leaves some questions about the struggle for power between those two. Technically, Clyburn will answer only to Pelosi and in the words of one senior aide, it may be a little bit of Darwinian survival of the fittest to see who prevails in this new leadership structure -- Bret. @!BAIER : Carl, where does this ban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be a meeting tomorrow on the Republicans behind closed doors where they 'll take an informal vote on their support for this proposed two-year moratorium. After that, it 's an open question. Late this afternoon, Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe took to the floor of the Senate with a warning for Republicans, making the case that depending on how earmarks are defined and how this all plays out, it 's entirely possible that Republicans could see an Obama-type budget pass and not have the old type of legislative tools to hold it under control. They could be stuck with it without the ability to throw in some of those earmarks. @!BAIER : All right, Carl. Much more on this with the panel. Thank you. One issue both sides agree must be addressed, expiring tax cuts. Basically, a giant tax increase the first of the new year. But White House correspondent Mike Emanuel reports there is still a big gap between parties on exactly what should be done. @!MIKE-EMANUEL-FOX- : Aboard Air Force One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obama reiterated his argument against extending the Bush tax cuts for higher income Americans. @!BARACK-OBAMA-PRES : It wo n't significantly boost the economy, and it 's hugely expensive. @!EMANUEL : Earlier, his senior adviser David Axelrod spoke about what the White House wants the lame duck Congress to do about the tax cuts. @!DAVID-AXELROD-OBA : We have to extend these middle class tax cuts. Absolutely we have to do that. We should do that permanently, give people the security of knowing that their taxes are n't going to go up. That will be important for the middle class and important for the country. @!EMANUEL : Republicans continue making the case it is not an actual tax cut, it is maintaining the current tax rate during a weak recovery. Senator Jim DeMint hinted to Chris Wallace about a potential compromise. @!JIM-DEMINT-@1R@2- : I hope we can get a permanent extension. But if the president wants to compromise on a two or three-year extension, what 's important here, Chris, is that businesses know what their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years so they can plan growth and plan to add people. @!EMANUEL : Senator Chuck Schumer continues to float a possible Democratic compromise by putting a salary cap on who would benefit. @!CHUCK-SCHUMER-@1D@ : What if we move it up to a million dollars. Everyone below $1 million will get a tax cut, but the millionaires and billionaires wo n't. And the plan I proposed would encompass virtually all small businesses. @!EMANUEL : Some experts suggest another potential deal could be extending all of the Bush tax cuts for a year, in exchange for an extension of unemployment benefits. Or perhaps a continuation of the Bush tax cuts in exchange for an early one year patch of the alternative minimum tax or AMT. @!SCOTT-HODGE-THE-T : Congress is certainly going to have to deal with the AMT. This is expired and about to hit about 20 to 24 million taxpayers. So they have to do something. And it sounds like a pretty reasonable tradeoff for a one or two-year extension of the Bush tax cuts. @!EMANUEL : There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the president may be interested in cutting a deal, Democrats particularly in the House may not be in the mood after the midterm election. If that is the case, taxes go up in the new year and this becomes item number one on the agenda when Republicans take control of the House -- Bret. @!BAIER : Mike Emanuel live on the North Lawn. Mike, thank you. Retail sales increased by 1.2 percent in October. Double what was expected and the largest amount in seven months. Stocks began the week mixed. The Dow gained 9 1/3. The S&amp;P 500 gave back 1 1/2. The Nasdaq dropped 4 1/3. Money is at the root of the House ethics hearing for veteran New York Democratic Congressman Charlie Rangel. From filing taxes late to using House stationery for fundraising, Rangel admits the facts but denies intent. Correspondent Molly Henneberg reports today 's hearing got underway with money again taking center stage. @!MOLLY-HENNEBERG-F : Embattled New York Democratic Congressman Charlie Rangel told the House Ethics Committee today he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all due respect, since I do n't have counsel to advise me, I 'm going to have to excuse myself from this proceeding. @!HENNEBERG : With that, he left. Telling the committee his former legal team dropped him this fall, doubtful that he 'd be able to pay his future legal bills and insisted he has n't had time to raise money to get a new lawyer. He asked the committee to delay his trial. @!RANGEL : All I 'm doing is asking for the opportunity to have counsel. @!HENNEBERG : But the Democratic chairwoman of the ethics committee was n't buying Rangel 's not enough time argument. @!ZOE-LOFGREN-@1D-CA : Mr. Rangel 's counsel withdrew a little over a month ago and further counsel has not been retained. @!HENNEBERG : She said the trial would continue. @!LOFGREN : We recognize that Mr. Rangel has indicated that he does not intend to participate and it is his right not to participate. @!HENNEBERG : The 13 ethics charges against Rangel include failure to report income on a vacation home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a campaign office. Rangel has long maintained his innocence. But today, the four Democrats and four Republicans on the panel announced they were in agreement on the facts presented in the case and were going into a closed session to determine if Rangel is guilty on any of the counts. Rangel was not pleased. @!RANGEL : Yes, I saw it on television. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Have you been following it? @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : And what do you think about that? @!RANGEL : They do n't have any thoughts. @!HENNEBERG : Is that fair without you having a lawyer, sir? @!RANGEL : I 'm upset. @!HENNEBERG : If he 's found guilty on any of the counts, the full ethics committee would need to recommend a punishment. Meanwhile, there 's also a report today from the " New York Post, " owned by the parent company of FOX News Channel, that Rangel also may be in violation of House rules for using money from his political action committee to pay some of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't true -- Bret. @!BAIER : Molly, thank you. Alaska Republican Senate nominee Joe Miller says he wo n't challenge the results of the election if the math does not add up for his campaign. Officials are counting write-in votes in the race between Miller and write-in candidate Lisa Murkowski, the Republican incumbent. So far, she has just under 79,000 votes counted. Miller 's total as of Friday was around 87,500. Thousands of absentee and questioned ballots are also waiting to be counted. Two more candidates have declared for the Chicago mayor 's race. Congressman Danny Davis and state Senator James Meeks bring the field to five so far. That includes, of course, former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel who made his announcement Saturday. Former Senator Carol Moseley Braun is expected to declare soon. A very famous Democrat makes a big cameo. We will fill in the blanks in " The Grapevine. " And up next, some strange signals from Afghanistan. @!BAIER : A judge has refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa. The motion was filed after one of the jurors asked to be removed. Ahmed Ghailani has been charged with 285 counts relating to the attacks in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people. The judge denied the juror 's request and told the panel to continue deliberating. This case is seen as a key test of the administration 's plan to try terror suspects in civilian court. The hearing to determine if the suspected Fort Hood shooter should stand trial ended today with defense lawyers presenting no evidence. Major Nidal Hasan said he did not wish to make a statement. He faces 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 of attempted murder. Fort Hood 's commanding general will make the call about a trial. The Justice Department is offering up to $20,000 for information regarding the shootings at several military related buildings here in the Washington area. The shooter has taken nighttime shots at the Pentagon, two Marine Corps facilities and a Coast Guard recruiting office. In international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off in its efforts against the Taliban. Reporter Conor Powell is in Kabul with the diplomatic fallout. @!CONOR-POWELL-FOX- : And what is becoming a regular occurrence, Afghan President Hamid Karzai once again lashed out at the current U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, telling the " Washington Post " that the time has come for the U.S. to reduce military operations in Afghanistan. He also complained that American troops need to be less intrusive in the lives of ordinary Afghans. Karzai 's comments have angered the top American commander in Afghanistan, General David Petraeus, and stunned other senior U.S. officials. @!RICHARD-HOLBROOKE, : Some of the things he objected to are things which are being done at this time necessarily to support his government. And I think that has to be understood. @!POWELL : Karzai is also insisting U.S. troops end night raids on the homes of suspected Taliban insurgents. The raids are deeply unpopular in Afghanistan, but militarily effective. @!HILLARY-CLINTON-S : We believe that the use of intelligence-driven precision-targeted operations against high value insurgents and their networks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And these operations are conducted in full partnership with the government of Afghanistan. @!POWELL : General Petraeus is said to have expressed astonishment and disappointment with Karzai 's critical words, adding that they undermine the war effort. A spokesman for Karzai said today, the president was not criticizing the current U.S. policy in Afghanistan but the surge strategy designed by General Petraeus specifically calls for U.S. troops to be visible and out among the Afghan people. The current crisis comes as General Petraeus is trying to convince skeptical Americans and the White House that the surge is working and should be given more time to succeed. : On Friday, President Obama and other NATO leaders will gather in Portugal to discuss ending security responsibility to the Afghan security forces next summer. But the bigger question going forward for President Obama and General Petraeus is do they have a credible partner in Afghan President Hamid Karzai to handle the transition. In Kabul, Conor Powell, FOX News. @!BAIER : Israel may be allowed to finish hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. drafted deal to halt new construction for the sake of peace talks with the Palestinians. The U.S. is said to be offering an incentive of 20 stealth jet fighters capable of reaching Iran. Iran 's foreign minister says talks are continuing about a resumption in negotiations over his country 's nuclear program. The west is pushing Tehran to open all of its nuclear facilities to inspection and give up uranium enrichment. Still ahead, why are you picking up the bill for all those foreclosures? And next, he wants the election to be about economics and not health care. Mitt Romney, the next focus of our " 20 in 2012 " series. @!BAIER : Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney is usually one of the first people mentioned in the discussion about possible 2012 presidential candidates. But along with many positives, Romney may be burdened by an issue that has already proven to be a rallying cry against Democrats and President Obama. @!MITT-ROMNEY-@1R@2, : Thank you. Wow. This is a welcome to the Nancy Pelosi-Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary runs to form, Mitt Romney might be the favorite to win. In 2008, Romney was running second before dropping out when it became clear John McCain would be the nominee. @!LARRY-SABATO-UNIV : Mitt Romney is absolutely certain to run. Of all the candidates, he is the most certain to run. @!BAIER : And he has Republican presidential politics in his blood. His father George, an auto executive, was governor of Michigan who ran for president in 1968, but lost to Richard Nixon. After amassing a reported $200 million fortune on Wall Street, Mitt in 1994, unsuccessfully challenged Massachusetts incumbent Senator Ted Kennedy. In 1999, Romney took over a scandal-plagued Salt Lake City Olympic Committee and turned the 2002 Winter Games into commercial success. The next year he ran for Massachusetts governor and won. His signature achievement as governor, legislation that extended health care coverage to everyone in Massachusetts by employing an array of financial carrots and sticks, such as tax penalties if you did n't buy insurance. Romney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran for president in 2008. @!ROMNEY : Getting our free market finally able to allow all of our citizens to have insurance, health insurance, that 's something we did in Massachusetts. @!BAIER : But it 's turned out to be more and more expensive and less and less popular as the years have passed. When the passage of Obamacare caused a nationwide uproar in 2010, Romney Care appears to have become Mitt Romney 's biggest liability among Republican voters. @!SEAN-HANNITY-HOST : I asked you specifically about the health care that you brought to Massachusetts. And obviously the country has rejected Obamacare, nationalized health care, socialized medicine. You 've made a very strong defense that there was no similarity in your mind and that there were great differences. What are those differences in the health care? @!ROMNEY : Our bill was a state solution to a state problem within the rights of the constitution. Obamacare is a federal intrusion of power taking over the rights of states and the rights of families, the rights of doctors. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that reason, I think it needs to be repealed and we need to do a better job to get health care reform in a way that makes it work more like a market. @!BAIER : Romney refused to sit down with me for this series, but he has appeared on a number of FOX News programs. Bill O'Reilly also hit him on health care. @!BILL-O'REILLY-HOS : Massachusetts has the highest per capita health care cost in the union -- @!ROMNEY : Yes. O'REILLY : -- in the nation. @!ROMNEY : And it did before the bill was passed, too. O'REILLY : Is n't this what would bring the cost down? @!ROMNEY : No. What the bill did -- O'REILLY : No, it 's not? @!ROMNEY : No, what the bill did was to say look, we 're going to solve a problem at the state level. Two big things that are very different than Obamacare. One is, states should be able to solve state problems. The federal government should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right of states. We solved our problem at a bipartisan basis. We also had the business community, the health care community come together. @!BAIER : Romney would much rather talk about something else. @!ROMNEY : We 're going to make the changes necessary to maintain the spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation and creativity. @!BAIER : His plan to turn around the economy. @!SABATO : Romney 's greatest strength is economics. If we 're still having severe economic dislocation in 2012, Romney can sell his background as a businessman, as savior of the Olympics, as governor of Massachusetts. He fits the bill. @!BAIER : One wonders if Romney would have defeated McCain in 2008 if the financial crisis hit a couple of months before the primaries ended rather than a couple of months after. @!ROMNEY : I want to make it very clear that I 'm not going to raise taxes. As governor of Massachusetts, I made it very clear there and I did not raise taxes. We faced a huge budget gap and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know some people want to raise taxes but that 's going to hurt working families and scare away jobs. I recognized that raising taxes could also lead to a slowdown in our economy and so we did n't do it. We balanced our budget. And that 's exactly what I 'll do with the federal government. @!BAIER : He is also a Mormon. It was thought his religion might hurt him with voters. Not true according to the polls. @!SABATO : Mormonism is not going to stop Mitt Romney from being president. @!BAIER : What could hurt him with conservative voters is his position on abortion. @!ROMNEY : I 've always been personally pro-life. I 've taught that to others. It 's been part of my faith. The question for me was what should government do in this kind of setting? @!BAIER : As an adult, Romney has changed his position on abortion, not once but twice. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Republicans did n't see him as authentic. They did n't know, you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is he a moderate? @!ROMNEY : My friend, your senator, Marco Rubio. @!BAIER : Which brings us to Romney 's relationship with the Tea Party movement. He did endorse Marco Rubio of Florida. But unlike potential 2012 rivals Sarah Palin and South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint, Romney did not jump in early to endorse anti-establishment candidates such as Christine O'Donnell or Sharron Angle. Unlike many Washington Republicans, he did not gripe when those Tea Party candidates won their primaries. Instead, he wrote them big checks. @!ROMNEY : Right now, I want to make sure we 're using all of our energy and all of our breath focused on getting Republicans elected tomorrow. @!BAIER : Most believe Romney was trying to play it just right for a 2012 run. @!ROMNEY : We have n't made our mind up as to even what the process will be or when we 'll make our final decision. But I do n't think it 's anytime immediately coming down the track. It 's the energy and passion that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going all over America that says you know what? We 're going to keep the American dream alive and well. @!BAIER : Our " 12 in 2012 " series continues Tuesday with former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. Bill Clinton and another hangover? It 's not what you think. We 'll explain in " The Grapevine. " And guess whose fault it is that Republicans dominated the midterms. We 'll tell you. @!BAIER : And now some fresh pickings from the " Political Grapevine. " Two well-known liberal commentators are blaming Americans in general and whites in particular for the Democratic falloff in the midterm elections. HBO host Bill Maher made a canine comparison, saying, quote, " America is like a dog. I 'm sorry, but it is. It can not understand actual words. It understands inflection, it understands fear, but you ca n't actually explain issues to a dog. " Filmmaker Michael Moore said, quote, " White America does not like having a black president. That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview, Moore had advice for President Obama, saying, quote, " The conservative Democrats, the majority of them were booted out. The liberals won. President Obama should take this country in the progressive direction he was elected to take it in. " The upcoming sequel to the hit movie " The Hangover " got the presidential treatment over the weekend. Celebrity website TMZ reports former President Bill Clinton, seen here leaving the set, shot a cameo for the flick while visiting Bangkok, Thailand. Mr. Clinton 's office did not respond to our requests for comment. And finally today was not just the normal day, a school day for 13-year-old Cody Alicia. The northern California boy, I should say, who was told he could n't in school with an American flag on his bike gained national attention for the controversy. @! UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : This is the United States. When they asked me to take the flag down, I was kind of upset. @!BAIER : Veterans and others all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. So this morning, as you can see, dozens of motorcycles showed up to accompany Cody to school with American flags flying everywhere, including the back of his bike. Executives from major lenders will be on Capitol Hill this week to talk about foreclosures, whether they have been handling properly and how to keep borrowers in their homes. Chief Washington correspondent Jim Angle reports every taxpayer has a stake in the outcome whether you know it or not. @!JIM-ANGLE-FOX-NEW : When you see a foreclosure sign, chances are good that you as a taxpayer are on the hook for the cost involved because Congress has its own money pit, federal guarantees of mortgages gone bad, with official estimates putting the tab at more than $300 billion. @!DAVID-JOHN-HERITA : And it 's probably likely to be closer to $500 billion by the time all of this is finished. And you and I get to pay that. @!ANGLE : One reason the cost is so high is two agencies now controlled by the federal government managed lion 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Freddie Mac own or guarantee a little over half the mortgages in this country. @!ANGLE : And their role is getting bigger, not smaller. @!PETER-WALLISON-AM : They are buying 90 percent of all the loans made in the United States, all the home loans made in the United States today. @!ANGLE : Fannie and Freddie, as they 're known, now holds up 240,000 foreclosures, which means additional costs. @!WALLISON : They have to be kept sealed during the winter. They have to be protected against vandalism and so forth. @!JOHN : The house is abandoned and sitting there just waiting for someone to strip it out or have kids go in and decide to see if matches really work. @!ANGLE : In fact, Fannie and Freddie has spent $2 billion in taxpayer money just this year to maintain empty homes, one of the many reason a key official says that foreclosure are justified, they should go forward so the homes can be sold. @!DEMARCO : If we delay the foreclosure it will add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fannie and Freddie, I 'm charged to minimize the taxpayer losses, and we 're working very hard to do that. @!WALLISON : They will never recover the total amount they 're owed. But the longer we do not foreclose, the worse their losses are going to be. @!ANGLE : With all of that on the table, President Obama has nominated a new person to run the agency, Joseph A. Smith. And his previous positions may make the job even harder. @!JOHN : We do n't know quite what he is going to do, but we do know he has been active in trying to slow down foreclosures in North Carolina. @!ANGLE-@1on-camera@ : But that could slow down the process of working through bad loans and getting qualified buyers into those homes. The slower the process, the more it costs the government, meaning the more it costs you, the taxpayer. In Washington, Jim Angle, FOX News. @!BAIER : This just in to FOX News. North Carolina Democratic Congressman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position of House minority leader in the next Congress. Pelosi will lose her current spot as House speaker, of course, once Republicans take control. Shuler says Democrats will have better chance to regain some seats they lost in the midterms if Pelosi is not the leader in 2012. Shuler is saying he 's making good on campaign promise that he would challenge her if she was seeking the minority leader position. Congress is back, and there is already a big change. We 'll talk about the lame duck session with the FOX all-stars when we come back. '
