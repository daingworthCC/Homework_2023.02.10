21741 qwq @! DOUGLAS-FORD-ARSO : I set the fire at the fire station. I burned it down. I cant say any more than that. Im sorry for what I did. qwq @! RATHER : Firefighter Douglas Fords case is certainly exceptional, but his kind of problem is not unheard of. Every year in this country, a disturbing number of firefighters are arrested for arson. qwq @! TOM-AURNHAMMER-FI : Its what I refer to as our dirty little secret. qwq @! BOB-SIMON-CBS-COR : No one combines art and commerce quite like this Jay-Z. When we joined him on tour this summer, we saw firsthand how he promotes all his products, the other artists on his label, his clothing line, and his movie production company, all on stage. Theyre not just selling music, theyre selling a lifestyle. Are you the best? qwq @! JAY-Z-MUSICIAN-R : I think every rapper should feel like theyre the best. qwq @! SIMON : OK, thats how you feel, but can anyone do this the way you do? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it. qwq @! SIMON : Jay-Z has already sold over 15 million albums, and the audience is overwhelmingly white. qwq @! JIM-STEWART-CBS-C : It was a cold-blooded killing in the town of Kirkland, Washington. The victim, Dawn Faring, a 27-year-old Bible student and missionary, had lived there for just three weeks before she was found in her bedroom, raped and strangled to death, in an apartment virtually sterile of clues. So youve got no DNA. qwq @! ATTORNEY-JAMES-KON : No DNA. qwq @! STEWART : And the clocks ticking. qwq @! KONAT : It always is. qwq @! STEWART : Frustrated detectives soon turned to a new technique to help them find, with a computer, what their own eyes could not, the hidden clue. And that case, as it turned out, forever changed the way crimes can be solved. qwq @! SIMON : Im Bob Simon. qwq @! RATHER : Im Dan Rather. qwq @! CHARLIE-ROSE-CBS- : Im @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mabrey. qwq @! SCOTT-PELLEY : Im Scott Pelley. Those stories and Charles Grodin, tonight on 60 MINUTES II. qwq @! RATHER : Imagine a firefighter, with a secret passion for setting fires, who ends up burning down his own firehouse. Sound unbelievable? Sadly, it is the true story of one of the men you are about to meet. Volunteer Firefighter Douglas Fords case is certainly exceptional, but his kind of problem nothing new, far from it. You may have heard of a case where a firefighter was arrested for arson, but, you know, it happens more than you might think. The vast majority of those arrests are made among the ranks of volunteer firefighters. These arsonists represent the dark side of a public service weve come to revere more than ever since September 11, but in some communities, the trust between the public and its firefighters has been broken. qwq @! FORD : I set the fire at the fire station. I burned it down. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what I did. qwq @! RATHER : Douglas Ford had been a volunteer firefighter for 12 years, with not one, but two Ohio departments. His career ended in February 2000, when he set a massive blaze that destroyed his own firehouse and everything in it. Today, he is serving a five-year sentence in a state prison, sorting out what set him off. qwq @! FORD : I think its plain just excitement of seeing the fire, even realizing its dangerous, but the excitement of the flame itself. qwq @! RATHER : It turns out this wasnt Douglas Fords first arson. He admitted that, at age 15, he set fire to a neighbors car and garage. He denied he had set any other fires, but then, slowly, he admitted to more. Well, tell me about some of the other fires you set. qwq @! FORD : Where I used to work, I set a Dumpster on fire. That job -- I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I set a row of lockers on fire there. qwq @! RATHER : Are there any fires that you set that we havent covered? qwq @! FORD : No. qwq @! RATHER : There were no others? Ever you set a fire at home? qwq @! FORD : Playing around, yes. qwq @! RATHER : Police say Douglas Ford is a suspect in many unexplained fires. Ultimately, he was convicted on only two counts of arson. No other cases were brought to trial. Thats not that unusual. Arson is a notoriously tough crime to trace and prosecute. Of 76,000 suspicious fires reported nationwide in 1998, only 16 percent resulted in arrest, and only 2 percent of those cases ended in conviction. There is no way to know how many of those fires involved firefighters. But what we do know raises serious questions. This summer, two massive forest fires in Colorado and Arizona swallowed up thousands of acres of timber and every home that got in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firefighters. Just weeks later, in California, a 19-year-old forest service firefighter was arrested for setting five fires near San Diego, destroying homes and paralyzing a community. In Pennsylvania, dozens of arsons terrorized the town of Kennett Square. The culprit was not only a volunteer firefighter, he was the son of the towns assistant chief. In Missouri, a volunteer firefighter is awaiting trial for murder for setting a fire that led to the death of a fellow firefighter. In Tennessee, three years ago, six volunteer firefighters were arrested for setting an abandoned home ablaze, accidentally killing another volunteer fireman. But he did nt die fighting the fire, he died spreading gasoline in the attic when the home burst into flames. In most of these cases, the firefighters were volunteers. But then, most of the firefighters in the country are volunteers, close to 75 percent. And when just one goes bad... qwq @! JOSEPH-WAMBAUGH-A : The damage they do in one fire set can be disastrous. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. qwq @! RATHER : And frequently is. qwq @! WAMBAUGH : And frequently is. qwq @! RATHER : In his latest book, " Fire Lover, " author Joseph Wambaugh profiles John Orr, a walking worst-case scenario for any fire department. Orr headed a large California arson squad and had a reputation for uncanny instincts about how an arson fire had started. It turned out that, in many cases, it wasnt instinct at all, it was inside knowledge. John Orr had set the fires. Investigators suspect he may have set as many as 2,000 fires, in the process, killing at least four people and earning a life sentence in prison. qwq @! WAMBAUGH : I could not have written this book as fiction because no one would publish a book about a homicide detective who turns out to be the serial killer everyones looking for. So that couldnt be written as fiction, but thats exactly what happened in this case. qwq @! RATHER : As background for his book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commit arson in particular. This sense of empowerment must be a factor for these people who set these serial fires. qwq @! WAMBAUGH : Its all about power and control. Think what they control. Theyve not only created a living thing, theyve created a living thing that is the object of massive attention. There are fire engines and people and noise and sirens and screaming and all of that. He s created this entire event that he can relive over and over until he has a need to do it again. qwq @! RATHER : The best firefighters are fascinated with fire. Their careers are case studies in how to outsmart fire, overwhelm it, overcome it. qwq @! UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : As a fireman, we really cant get enough of that. I mean, we really like to go fight fires -- the excitement, the adrenaline from fighting fires. qwq @! RATHER : We talked to a team of firefighters in Farmington, New Mexico. They told us that being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but it is also the mark of the very best firefighters. qwq @! UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Not everybody can be a firefighter. And it takes that special person that can deal with that adrenaline and know when to turn it on and turn it off. qwq @! RATHER : I think any reasonable person would raise an eyebrow reading the number of fires set by firefighters. qwq @! UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Its just astonishing how many people want the glory and how many cases are out there. I mean I cant believe that theres that many of our brothers and sisters out there that could even do that. qwq @! AURNHAMMER : Its what I refer to as our dirty little secret. qwq @! RATHER : Tom Aurnhammer is fire chief in Farmington, New Mexico. A fifth-generation firefighter, he is speaking out in hopes of doing something to stop arson within fire department ranks across the country. How long has this been swept under the rug? qwq @! AURNHAMMER : Its really kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that we tried to basically avoid talking about. qwq @! RATHER : Now lets talk about what can be done. Your recommendations? qwq @! AURNHAMMER : I think part of the problem lies in some of the smaller rural departments that are starved for help, and maybe if they have somebody that steps forward that wants to volunteer, theyre glad to have the person and may not take a close look at their background. qwq @! RATHER : So youre in favor of stronger background checks on everybody, but particularly with volunteer forces and rural and small town forces. qwq @! AURNHAMMER : Yes. But say youve got another person coming from another fire department, it does nt cost anything to pick up the phone and have a chat with the chief and say, how was this person as a firefighter? Have you guys had any problems? Was there any suspected fire-setting activities? Not always a fun question to ask. But I mean its probably one of the easiest ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cabe has been asking questions about firefighter arson for much of the past decade. In his job with the South Carolina State Forestry Commission, he became curious about exactly who was setting the states arson fires. qwq @! KEN-CABE-FIRE-INF : Most states do nt record the arson events that are caused by firefighters any more than they would set aside the ones that were caused by plumbers or carpenters or whatever. qwq @! RATHER : So Cabe began compiling statistics about firefighters and arson. He found that in South Carolina in 1993, 33 volunteer firefighters were arrested for setting fires. In 1994, 47 firefighters were caught. qwq @! CABE : We had perhaps hundreds of fires because people who set fires very seldom set just one. Were talking about a serial arson phenomenon here. qwq @! RATHER : Youve drawn up a profile of a firefighter who becomes a fire starter. In brief, outline that profile for me. qwq @! CABE : We found, generally, that these were young white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks who were of average to above-average intelligence, but maybe did nt do real well in their academic endeavors. But we found that a lot of these young men did nt have an awful lot in their lives that would distinguish them or would make them proud of themselves except their association with the fire service. And they were highly motivated, they were highly trained, and maybe the alarm did nt go off quite often enough for them. qwq @! RATHER : They wanted to fight fires? qwq @! CABE : They wanted to fight fires. qwq @! RATHER : Ken Cabe and South Carolinas fire professionals decided they had to do something to fight arson among their departments. qwq @! CABE : You arrest a firefighter for setting fires, thats front-page in most of the little towns in South Carolina. Its also a devastating thing to the fire department. Its a devastating thing to everybody in the fire service. So, public -- I think the public was very pleased when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we got a problem and were going to deal with it. qwq @! RATHER : The State Fire Commission began with a warning to all firefighters that even the smallest act of arson would not be tolerated. And firefighters were put on notice that penalties for any slip-ups would be severe. The centerpiece of the program was the most basic and the most obvious. The state barred anyone with a criminal record from becoming a firefighter. After a year, the new program had worked beyond its designers wildest dreams. qwq @! CABE : The following year, which was the year that most of the educational effort really fell into place, the following year, we only had three arrested in the entire state of South Carolina. So we went from averaging 30 something a year to three. Thats phenomenal. qwq @! RATHER : They are the most fundamental question to ask any potential firefighter : Who are you? Why do you want to do this? Can you be trusted? In too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never asked, with haunting results. When you applied for these volunteer firefighting jobs, did anybody ask you, did you ever set fires? Were you ever an arsonist? Did they ask you to sign any statements? qwq @! FORD : No, they didnt. @(COMMERCIAL-BREAK) qwq @! SIMON : Rap music isnt just about the mean streets anymore. Its just as much about Wall Street. And the message is more about the bottom line than the racial line, and the audience is overwhelmingly white. Its no wonder that rap has now surpassed country music as the nations second most popular genre, after rock-and-roll. And 33-year-old Jay-Z is the reigning king of rap. He owns his own record label, clothing line and movie production company, generating almost $500 million a year in sales. Its no coincidence that he named his record label Roc-A-Fella. Its an amazing achievement for a man who grew up in one of New Yorks toughest housing projects. He s living the 21st century version of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago, if somebody had come up to you in the projects and said, you know, youre going to be rich and I do nt mean rich, I mean rich. qwq @! JAY-Z : Right. qwq @! SIMON : And youre going to be famous and youre going to be a superstar, if somebody had said that to you 15 years ago, what would you have said? qwq @! JAY-Z : How? qwq @! SIMON : You were surviving, right? qwq @! JAY-Z : Yes. Like, I had no aspirations, no plans, no goals, no backup goals. Just like, how is that going to happen? Doing what? qwq @! SIMON : Well, by doing this : Bringing hip-hop to the heartland. And here in Arizona, the state that tried to ban the Martin Luther King holiday, white suburban teenagers are, as they say in the rap world, " gettin jiggy with it, " thanks to songs like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical " Annie. " It was Jay-Zs breakthrough hit, and it sold more than five million copies. Of the five million you sold, how many were sold to white suburban kids? qwq @! LYOR-COHEN-CHAIRM : I would say over four million. qwq @! SIMON : Lyor Cohen distributes Jay-Zs CDs. As the chairman of Island/Def Jam Records, he s made hundreds of millions of dollars selling rap music to suburbia. qwq @! COHEN : Sixty-five percent, maybe 70 percent of all of rap music sales are purchased by white people. qwq @! SIMON : At the age of 33, Jay-Z has already sold over 15 million albums, and his personal fortune is now north of $50 million. When we first met Jay-Z at his studio, he was sitting alone, humming to himself. qwq @! JAY-Z : Hey! qwq @! SIMON : How are you? qwq @! JAY-Z : Whats happening? qwq @! SIMON : Its the way he writes songs. qwq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget it. qwq @! SIMON : Was that a new song? qwq @! JAY-Z : Yes, yes. qwq @! SIMON : So when did you come up with the words? qwq @! JAY-Z : Just now. qwq @! SIMON : So like an hour ago, you did nt know what you were going to sing? qwq @! JAY-Z : No, I did nt know. Not even less than, like, 20 minutes ago. qwq @! SIMON : Its a startling process, a process Jay-Z has used to produce a new album every eight months for the last six years. He does nt write down any of his lyrics before he records a song. Its a feat of memorization that came from necessity. qwq @! JAY-Z : I used to get ideas, and I used to be running around. I used to be outside. I wasnt nowhere where I could write. Sometimes I used to run in the store, write them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you only can put so many paper bags in your pocket, you know? And, you know, so I had to start memorizing. qwq @! SIMON : Now, people have told me that, in the business, youve got the best flow. My problem is, I do nt know what that means. qwq @! JAY-Z : I say, like -- like if you -- heres a melody. Me, Ill rhyme like -- so Im so in sync with the beat, like, when the musics going boom boom ba boom boom ba boom boom, Im going bap dah dah dot dot dah dah dot, with words, though. See? qwq @! SIMON : Thats flow? qwq @! JAY-Z : Yes, it flow. qwq @! SIMON : Thats pretty intricate. qwq @! JAY-Z : Thats -- yes, thats a great word, intricate. Yes. qwq @! SIMON : Are you the best? qwq @! JAY-Z : I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! SIMON : OK, thats how you feel, but can anyone else do this the way you do? qwq @! JAY-Z : I havent heard no one do that. qwq @! SIMON : And no one combines art and commerce quite like Jay-Z. When we joined him on tour this summer, we saw firsthand how he promotes all his products, the other artists on his label, his clothing line, and his movie production company, all on stage. Its one giant commercial. First, he previewed their new movie, " Paid in Full. " Then he promoted all the rappers that make him money. For the finale, company president Damon Dash demoed their newest product, Armadale Vodka. Yes, thats right, Roc-A-Fella is now in the liquor business. Theyre not just selling music, theyre selling a lifestyle. qwq @! OK-getting-down-t# DAMON qwq @! DASH, PRESIDENT, ROC-A-FELLA RECORDS : We average between $50 million and $100 million a year. qwq @! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! DASH : I would say about 50, 100 maybe, you know, with video domestic. qwq @! SIMON : Roc-A-Wear clothes? qwq @! DASH : Roc-A-Wear did about 100 and some change. I think this year we did about $300 million. qwq @! SIMON : And you do nt even smile when you spat out these numbers. qwq @! DASH : Like I said, its all relative, man, you know? I want to be a $1 billion company. qwq @! SIMON : And Jay-Z is no stranger to the world of big business. Boarding a private jet to Albany, New York, the corporate chieftain is preparing to perform for a completely different audience. This time, its the white suits at a company called Transworld, who own and operate close to a thousand record stores across the country, including the Strawberries, Coconuts, and Camelot chains. The mean streets have come to main street, and the two cultures have a compelling common cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his new album. He s calling it " Blueprint II : The Gift and the Curse. " qwq @! JAY-Z : I look forward to coming here and sharing information with you guys and getting you guys opinion. qwq @! SIMON : Even we wondered how these middle-aged retail execs would respond to these sounds from the other side. Life wasnt always so sweet for Jay-Z. He was born Shawn Corey Carter in 1969. He spent his childhood in the Marcy Projects of Brooklyn. His father left him when he was 11. He was raised by his mother, Gloria Carter, who agreed to come back and give us a tour of the old neighborhood. Is this your mom? qwq @! JAY-Z : Yes. GLORIA qwq @! CARTER, qwq @! JAY-Zs MOTHER : Hi, Bob, how are you? qwq @! SIMON : How are you? Good to see you. qwq @! SIMON : She retired from a clerical job a few weeks ago. She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever suspect, the way some mothers do, that your son was going to be a superstar? qwq @! CARTER : No. qwq @! SIMON : She only realized how successful he was at a concert two years ago. qwq @! CARTER : Little girls were fainting at Jay-Z, and they were screaming, and I just stood there and I was like, he s really a star. And, of course, some of my friends was there also, and they was like, duh! Hello! qwq @! SIMON : Good morning. How do you like his music? qwq @! CARTER : Well, now, most of it I do like. But, you know, like the profanity could, like... qwq @! SIMON : Do you hear that, Jay? qwq @! CARTER :... be a little less, but... qwq @! JAY-Z : Shi... qwq @! CARTER : But thats a reality. Thats a reality. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as these people, these kids are concerned. qwq @! SIMON : Was there any point you were really worried about him? qwq @! CARTER : Yes. qwq @! SIMON : So you were worried that things might go wrong? qwq @! CARTER : The elements. Yes, the elements, you know? qwq @! SIMON : The elements? qwq @! CARTER : Yes. qwq @! SIMON : The elements shes talking about were crack and crime. And during the 1980s, the Marcy Projects were among the most dangerous places in America. Jay-Z often writes songs about his time there, including the day he shot his older brother in the shoulder for stealing his jewelry. He was 12 years old. And here are some lyrics you wrote about your brother. You said, " saw the devil in your eyes, high off more than weed, confused, I just closed my young eyes and squeezed, what a sound, opened my eyes just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " qwq @! JAY-Z : Yes, I wouldnt feel comfortable talking about that on TV. I just -- its not cool. qwq @! SIMON : OK. qwq @! JAY-Z : Thats a bit over the line. qwq @! SIMON : OK. And then you were a teenager during the height of the crack epidemic. Was it a pretty rough time for you? qwq @! JAY-Z : It was a pretty rough time for everyone, like, especially -- I mean, in that neighborhood, it was a plague in that neighborhood. It was just everywhere. In the hallways, you could smell it in the hallways. qwq @! SIMON : And how did it impact you? qwq @! JAY-Z : It -- back then, it was like -- I would say it was like, two things : Like, it was either you was doing it or you was moving it. qwq @! SIMON : And you was moving it? qwq @! JAY-Z : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hustler. qwq @! SIMON : Drug dealer? qwq @! JAY-Z : Thats a harsh word. Yes, yes. qwq @! SIMON : Did your mom know you were dealing crack? qwq @! JAY-Z : No. She had a lot of trust in me. She gave me a long leash, and she let me, you know, learn on my own. qwq @! SIMON : The story goes that when you got to the end of the leash, and you were dealing drugs, somebody tried to kill you. Is that right, or is that... qwq @! JAY-Z : Yes, I mean -- yes. I was shot at before. qwq @! SIMON : In fact, he was shot at three times, from just six feet away. Miraculously, none of the bullets hit him. It was then when Jay-Z traded in the crack game for the rap game. It was nothing new to him. Hed been rapping since he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. But nobody would sign him. So, together with Damon Dash and some friends, Jay-Z started selling CDs out of his car. Thats when he started Roc-A-Fella Records. The rest is history. Some people say that the success of Roc-A-Fella comes from its hustler mentality. Would you accept that or argue with that? qwq @! DASH : Yes. Entrepreneurial, hustler -- say it the way you want to say it -- just that hunger to make money and to make your situation better. qwq @! SIMON : Different cultures, different words. qwq @! DASH : Just different words, slang. qwq @! SIMON : They mean the same thing. qwq @! DASH : Entrepreneur is slang for hustler, and hustler is slang for entrepreneur, it just depends on where you at. qwq @! SIMON : But just as Jay-Z was beginning to be recognized as an entrepreneur, he fell back into his old hustler ways. qwq @! UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Jay-Z, what do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you, Jay-Z? qwq @! SIMON : In 1999, he stabbed record exec, Lance Rivera, at a nightclub. Police say he thought Rivera was bootlegging his music. You know, its one thing to get in a fight in a club when you do nt have that much to lose, but what Im trying to put together in my mind... qwq @! JAY-Z : Right. qwq @! SIMON : I mean, you are an incredible success story. You have built an empire, and you put it all at risk like that. qwq @! JAY-Z : Yes, I think that was a wake-up call and a calling card for me that -- to let me know, like, it could just all go down the drain. Like, it could all be taken away from me. qwq @! SIMON : And now youre confident that youre more under control than you were? qwq @! JAY-Z : All the time, ever, ever, than ever. qwq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! JAY-Z : Never. qwq @! SIMON : He was sentenced to three years of probation. Since the stabbing, Jay-Z went on to make four more successful albums. Rapper, businessman, hustler, Jay-Z, the son of Marcy, has seen more highs and lows in 33 years than most people see in a lifetime. Before we left, he asked his engineer, Guru, to play us one last song to let us know how far he had come and how he did it his way. qwq @! JAY-Z : Im from the hood, man. You know, the real hood, not the rap hood, the real hood, like three pair of pants and a pair of sneakers. My Moms busting her ass. Im going to Japan tomorrow. You understand what Im saying? Can you believe that? Thats right. Its a beautiful thing, man. I did it my way qwq @! SIMON : Thats good stuff. qwq @! JAY-Z : It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It makes sense and its... qwq @! JAY-Z : Its not just hippity- boppity-ski-bop. @(COMMERCIAL-BREAK) qwq @! MABREY : What happens when police find a murder victim, but virtually no clues to help track down the killer? As Jim Stewart tells us, detectives now have a new tool for the toughest of cases. qwq @! STEWART : It started not long ago in Washington state, when police came across a scene all too familiar : A young woman found murdered in her own home and virtually no evidence to tell them how it happened. Frustrated detectives soon turned to a new technique to help them find, with a computer, what their own eyes could not, the hidden clue. And that case, as it turned out, forever changed the way crimes can be solved. The technique is known as digital fingerprint enhancement, and its become the silver bullet for police forensic units all across the country, all because of one determined man and one horrific crime. It was a cold-blooded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside Seattle. The victim, Dawn Fehring, a 27-year-old Bible student and missionary, had lived there for just three weeks before she was found in her bedroom, raped and strangled to death, in an apartment virtually sterile of clues. qwq @! KONAT : It was spotless. I mean you could still see in the carpet the lines from the vacuum cleaner. There was not a water glass on the countertop. James Konat was the prosecutor in charge of the investigation. Right at the start, it was clear to him that his detectives were in for a tough one. They discovered that Fehring had been baking for mothers day and most likely left her front door open for ventilation. That explained why there was no sign of forced entry. And they had no witness, no motive, and no hot leads. Was there any trace evidence in Dawn Fehrings apartment? qwq @! KONAT : Very little. qwq @! STEWART : So youve got no DNA. qwq @! KONAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clocks ticking. qwq @! KONAT : It always is. qwq @! STEWART : With Dawn Fehrings killer on the loose, police were hoping for a quick break. So if there was ever a time they needed to find suspicious fingerprints, this was it. But the only real clue they found that day, as this police video tape shows, did nt look promising. It was the victims bed sheet, with some bloody smudges on it, like someone had wiped their hands. qwq @! KONAT : Prior to this time, we were not aware of any situation where a fingerprint, or in this case a palm print, had ever been lifted off a fabric, like a bed sheet, particularly a print that had been left in blood. qwq @! STEWART : As every prosecutor knows, you cant dust a bed sheet for prints. The reason is that all the distinguishing arches, whirls, and loops of a print get lost in the fabric. Technicians tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemicals, rinsed it, and dried it, as in this demonstration, really just hoping for the best. And they got detail, all right, but there was a catch. The process also highlighted the weave of the sheet, virtually obscuring the mountain- like ridges of prints. Thats when they called on Erik Berg, a forensic expert with the nearby Tacoma Police, for help. qwq @! ERIK-BERG-FORENSI : As youre following a ridge, trying to identify the details in the fingerprint, your eye tends to go off on those lines. So we need to get rid of that fabric pattern, its in the way. qwq @! STEWART : Although he worked in the forensic unit, Bergs real passion was computers. Heavily investing, in his own time and money, Berg had spent years in the back room of his house, developing software that could enhance crime scene photos. Hed been itching to try it on a real murder, and now he had one. qwq @! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hand, if I were to put my hand like that. And heres some creases, even, that you can see in the skin. Youve got a ridge that comes along here and then, oops, heres all this pattern. qwq @! STEWART : And you want to get that pattern out of whats blocking a clear view of the fingerprint. qwq @! BERG : Right. You can see the fingerprint ridges there, right? qwq @! STEWART : Right. qwq @! BERG : As I remove them, theyre becoming clearer. qwq @! STEWART : Berg selected what are known as pattern removal filters from his own computer program, which he called More Hits, as well as from Adobe Photoshop, the same software used by artists and on many home computers to fix up photographs and create special effects. Why, its just like a photo lab. qwq @! BERG : Yes. qwq @! STEWART : The pictures becoming apparent. qwq @! BERG : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will process this entire image, removing those patterns I just identified and leaving everything else. And as youll see, its going to be pretty apparent. qwq @! STEWART : Now you got a fingerprint. qwq @! BERG : Now Ive got a fingerprint. Now if I want to clean it up a little bit, I can just adjust the contrast, like you would on your TV. Im going to kind of tweak the contrast a little bit. Im going to bring this over. And now its just a little bit prettier. But heres the fingerprint ridges. No more fabric to pull my eye away. qwq @! STEWART : Now, can a fingerprint expert take something as clear as that and go and make a match? qwq @! BERG : Oh, most definitely. Yes. qwq @! STEWART : Once Berg was through, he printed out his work and handed it back to the examiners, who then checked for anyone considered even a potential suspect who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They found one. It was a palm print from Eric Hayden, a 32-year-old mill worker who lived just one flight up from Dawn Fehrings apartment. They used their magnifying glasses and compared Haydens print from the files with the enhanced print, arch by arch, loop by loop, whirl by whirl. qwq @! BERG : Bingo, it was him. So I got a phone call two hours after that saying he was in custody. And that was probably the most amazing thing Id ever seen. Ive never heard of anybody making an identification and, within two hours, making an arrest. That was just unheard of. qwq @! STEWART : There it is. qwq @! BERG : There it is. qwq @! STEWART : But all of Bergs work would mean nothing at trial if he couldnt prove it did nt alter the evidence. So he created what he calls an authentication system, to keep track of the photos pixels, those tiny dots that form an image on the computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keystroke he executed, so that any expert could repeat the process. qwq @! BERG : Everything I just did is right here. qwq @! STEWART : It makes a note of when you go into the file, and every change that you make to the file. qwq @! BERG : Correct. qwq @! STEWART : Sound like a little voodoo science at the time? qwq @! KONAT : Well, until you understand that its simply photography, it certainly did. In fact, ultimately, thats the issue the jurors struggled with the most, was this idea of digital photography. They couldnt seem to, at the outset, put their hands on the fact that it wasnt film, in the traditional sense, but rather an image that could be preserved, set aside, and then manipulated. qwq @! STEWART : But once jurors watched Berg demonstrate his work, they believed in it. Hayden was convicted, and ultimately sentenced to 26 years for the rape and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the science that solved it. qwq @! BERG : I really believe that when he left there, he thought hed gotten away with it. qwq @! STEWART : But he left a calling card only you could read. qwq @! BERG : Right. I simply helped somebody else go get him. qwq @! STEWART : It did nt take long for cops all around the country to grasp the significance. With this system, cases that were once deemed un- solvable suddenly became hot again. Interest skyrocketed, and forensics labs began shelling out more than $40,000 for their own package, including Floridas Broward County sheriffs office, where Dave Knoerlein has worked with the technology for two years now. qwq @! DAVE-KNOERLEIN-BR : Were looking at other cases and looking, re-looking at the evidence in those cases to see if that would benefit from digital enhancement. qwq @! STEWART : Stuff that you just had to put up on a shelf and say, gee, we cant use, you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qwq @! STEWART :... bring it to life? qwq @! KNOERLEIN : Absolutely. qwq @! STEWART : Like in the case of Florida vs. Victor Reyes. Reyes, a convicted drug dealer, is charged with murder in connection with the 1996 execution-style shooting of a man whose body was found dumped by the side of the road, wrapped in a blanket, and bound with duct tape. Last year, five years after the killing, Bergs software began to play a role. Detectives took some photo negatives of smudged prints on the duct tape that originally had been deemed of no value, and sent them to Knoerlein. qwq @! KNOERLEIN : There was faint ridge detail, enough that, if I did apply contrast to that area, the ridges would be more visible. qwq @! STEWART : Like fiddling with a TV? qwq @! KNOERLEIN : Absolutely. The enhancement process is exactly like fiddling with the TV. qwq @! STEWART : In this case, the TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, More Hits and Adobe Photoshop. And when Knoerlein finished fiddling with them, analysts concluded that the once unusable prints now matched Victor Reyes prints. qwq @! BARBARA-HEYER-VIC : I think this is a prime example of junk science. qwq @! STEWART : Barbara Heyer represents Victor Reyes. Shes mounting an aggressive attack against digital fingerprint enhancement like no one has before. qwq @! HEYER : Its very suspicious that you have something that is of no value, and you suddenly enhance it and becomes of value. I mean its very clear that this type of thing can be manipulated. qwq @! STEWART : Most of us are familiar with the fact that you can take the photograph of the president and put it on the face of a man from Mars. qwq @! HEYER : Right. qwq @! STEWART : Youre not implying that police would go so far as to create something out of whole cloth, though, are you? qwq @! HEYER : What Im suggesting is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as absurd as that and to make it look real, so that its quite easy to take a smudge mark and make it into a partial print. qwq @! KNOERLEIN : It was just an extremely faint print, or a print that had detail that just needed a little boost. qwq @! STEWART : A major boost, as it turns out. Not only did Knoerlein remove the background pattern of the duct tape, as Berg did with the bed sheet, his fiddling went a step further. He boosted the image, using a technique called dodge and burn, which uses a computer brush to create highlights and shadows in a picture, like photographers do in the dark room. It sounds like an art form, though, instead of a science. qwq @! KNOERLEIN : Well, I would say, if youre being creative and doing photo as an art form, then, yes, sure, it could be an art form. As a forensic analyst, doing digital image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Im not trying to create something. Im trying to make something thats already there more visible. qwq @! STEWART : The distinction is crucial because unlike removing background, like a fabric pattern, a process that can be tracked and copied, dodging and burning is a different matter altogether. It is as arbitrary as making a brush stroke on a canvas. It can never be done the exact same way again by another forensic expert. And that raises the specter of evidence tampering. You cant duplicate it exactly. qwq @! KNOERLEIN : No. qwq @! STEWART : Can you get close? qwq @! KNOERLEIN : Very close. qwq @! STEWART : Close is good enough? qwq @! KNOERLEIN : I would think so. qwq @! HEYER : Close? Thats not good enough. I mean, when youre talking about someones liberty, taking someones liberty away, I do nt believe that the courtroom is the place to try out this junk science. qwq @! KONAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are enhancing an image, but you are doing so by removing the color and by removing the weave or the fabric in the background. qwq @! STEWART : Doodling with the evidence, some might say. qwq @! KONAT : Sounds like something a defense lawyer would say. qwq @! STEWART : Bergs work on the Fehring murder was found to be valid and went on to become part of a landmark case in the state of Washington. Since then, other states have followed, ruling that, although new, it is, indeed, a science fit for the courtroom. That includes Florida, where the judge has allowed it into trial of Victor Reyes. Erik Berg will most likely be called to the stand to defend his invention. If you are of a mind to do so, and we pray that cops never are, but could you manipulate this? qwq @! BERG : I think anything man can invent, man can manipulate. So Im not going say, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an authentication process, so if youre going to do this, its going to be a purposeful kind of a manipulation. Theres not going to be, oh, well, I did nt know I did that. You knew you did it. qwq @! STEWART : In the end, it all comes down to trust. And Eric Haydens arrest, in one of the first murder cases to use digital fingerprint enhancement, is the best proof so far that the science works. qwq @! BERG : Im not putting your clients fingerprint on the evidence and saying, look what I found. Your client put that fingerprint there. I simply found it. Now, did I find it with a magnifying glass? Did I find it with a brush and powder? No. I found it with a computer. @(COMMERCIAL-BREAK) qwq @! MABREY : UN inspectors are wondering what Saddam might be hiding and where. And thats got Charles Grodin wondering, too. qwq @! CHARLES-GRODIN-CB : I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge country. You could fit a whole lot of Connecticuts, where I live, into Iraq. Look. I get the impression it wouldnt be that hard to hide something in Connecticut. Sometimes, when Im just driving around, I see all kinds of places to hide things. Were forever reading reports that something the size of a suitcase or smaller could cause terrible damage. Go find something smaller than a suitcase in Iraq. We havent been able to find this 64 " Saudi Arabian anywhere. I guess we hope we get people to tell us exactly where to look, but do nt you get the feeling if there were all these Iraqis who cant wait to spill the beans, they would have already? No question theyd be very tense about it, so maybe the idea is that some Iraqis will just jump over to our side and tell the inspectors where to look. When Saddams guys say, come on in, go wherever you want to go, well find stuff, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Thats not ours. How did that get there? I hope thats what happens, and then we could skip the war part. qwq @! MABREY : Im Vicki Mabrey. Well be back two weeks from tonight at our regular time, 8:00, 7:00 Central, with another edition of 60 MINUTES II. END
