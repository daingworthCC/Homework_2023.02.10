4072241 @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) All right, Nick. Thank you for the reporting this morning. We 're gon na turn now to the economy. Vice President Biden 's reference that out-of-work Americans feel like this is a depression, may have touched a nerve. In the latest ABC News /'Washington Post " poll, President Obama 's handling of the economy slipped below majority approval for the first time. @GRAPHICS @GRAPHICS @GRAPHICS @GRAPHICS @GRAPHICS @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) And this comes as the housing market shows signs of needing more help. ABC 's senior White House correspondent Jake Tapper is in Washington. He has more on this for us. Good morning, Jake. @!JAKE-TAPPER-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) Good morning, Chris. Well, this morning the Senate Banking Committee will hold a hearing on extending the housing credit set to expire in December. Meanwhile, eight months after the administration unveiled the - a plan to help those with mortgage problems, it 's unveiling a new plan for homeowners. All the while, unemployment continues to skyrocket. @!JAKE-TAPPER-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) The Vice President recalled an old adage that when the guy across town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. When your brother is, it 's a recession. And when you 're out of work, it 's a depression. @!VICE-PRESIDENT-JOE# It 's a depression for millions of Americans, through no fault of their own. @!JAKE-TAPPER-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) It seemed a change in tone from last month when the Vice President said of the stimulus, ' In my wildest dreams, I never thought it would work this well. " Even with the Dow hitting 10,000, unemployment will continue to get worse. The White House knows more and more Americans need help. And they 're looking for ways to provide it. This week, the administration announced a new program to try to restart the housing market for low to moderate income, first-time homebuyers. State housing agencies will be able to provide new mortgages, with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae providing credit lines, backstopped by the federal government. @!SUSAN-DEWEY-@1PRES# This plan will really help the states provide affordable housing to first-time homebuyers. Our role is to make sure not only that people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay in the homes. @!JAKE-TAPPER-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) It 's a program that has its skeptics. @!PETER-MORICI-@1PRO# State local housing finance administrations provide a lot of assistance where it 's needed. But we should n't be fooled into thinking this will help hundreds of thousands of people very quickly. It 's more like tens of thousands and slowly. @!LESLEE-RAMOS-@1WOR# In the past, I 've tried - thousands of things that they 've said. New programs that they 're gon na help the homeowners. And nothing has worked out. @!JAKE-TAPPER-@1-ABC# @(Voiceover) Three years ago, Leslee Ramos bought a three-bedroom townhouse in Malibu Bay, Florida for $255,000. Since then, the value of the home sank to $121,000. She needed housing help. But Ramos 's bigger problem, she lost her job. @!LESLEE-RAMOS-@1WOR# Right now, I 'm so far behind that I 'm just afraid that the bank is gon na foreclose on my property. @!JAKE-TAPPER-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) And that 's the bigger problem the White House faces, massive unemployment. The White House this week is likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses so they can hire, among other things. That - they will raise the credit limit for SBA loans and provide access to small businesses to some of that $700 billion in TARP funds. Robin? @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) All right. Jake, thank you. And joining us now for a reality check on the economy, Liz Anne Sonders. She 's the chief investment strategist for Charles Schwab. And joining us from Nashville, Dave Ramsey, host of ' The Dave Ramsey Show " on the Fox Business Network and on radio. Good morning to you both. @!LIZ-ANNE-SONDERS-@# Good morning. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Thank you so much. Dave, let 's start with you first. What are your listeners telling you? Does it feel like a depression to them? @!DAVE-RAMSEY-@1HOST# No, it does n't. And that 's a really unfortunate choice of terms for the Vice President of the United States to use. That was - political drama queen mode. Yes, if you 're out of work or you 're in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes, it feels like a depression for them. I do n't doubt that. But you should n't send that verbal, those verbal waves blowing across the land and, for that matter, across the world when you 're the Vice President. There are certainly some folks like the lady you were dealing with there in the - in the piece just a second ago that are struggling and facing foreclosure, though. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) So where do you see the economy right now? And you 've, you 've said all along, real estate will lead the way, should lead the way. @!DAVE-RAMSEY-@1HOST# It is leading the way. We 're seeing real estate pick up considerably. We 've got 4.5% fixed rates, and that is driving the market. The $8,000 tax credit is driving the first-time homebuyers into the market, the - the financially healthy ones. And so, real estate will lead the way out. @GRAPHICS @!DAVE-RAMSEY-@1HOST# But we 're not going to bounce back out of this. We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, we 've started to see the, of course, the, the stock market recover. We 've all seen the Dow top 10,000. And lastly, and sadly lastly, is gon na be the jobs that are gon na follow out. They were the last thing to go down going into this. And I think they 're gon na be the last thing coming out. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) I think a lot of people feel that way, Dave. Liz Anne, talking about jobs, the unemployment rate, 9.8%. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# Mm-hmm. @GRAPHICS @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) There are a few top economists that say we 're gon na top 10%. And it could stay that way for an - an extended period of time. That that could be the new normal, if you will. Do you agree with that? @!LIZ-ANNE-SONDERS-@# Well, I certainly hope that that 's not the case. And I think there are some, some pluses to just how dire things got in terms of jobs. You know, that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use to describe our economy. But if you think back a year ago, there was grave concern that that 's what we were heading into. And as a result of that, companies braced for the worst and, I think, ended up cutting probably about 50% more jobs than what the, what we know in hindsight, the worst of the economy suggested they should have. So I do think there 's an opportunity for a bounce back. And given how strong corporate profits have been, somewhat thanks to the job cuts and all the productivity that 's now embedded, that tends to be a good leading indicator of jobs. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) But will those profits lead to new jobs, because part of the reason they have the profits is because they cut jobs. @!LIZ-ANNE-SONDERS-@# When we start to see demand come back in, and we 're starting to see it. We 're starting to see some of the natural juices for the economy, those natural animal spirits kicking in now here. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is employment very lean right now, inventories are lean. Production is very low. I think we 're gon na get that coiled spring that I 've talked about on this show before, that snapback, that is, I think, has the potential to be sharper than a lot of people think. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Yeah. And you have talked about that quite a bit. Dave, wan na go back to you because you alluded to Jake Tapper 's piece and the woman that we saw there. And foreclosures, we 're seeing that more and more. And foreclosures are - are leading to people going to homeless shelters. That 's a, a fact that we have not seen before. Usually, if you lost your home, you were able to perhaps rent another property. But in, in the Midwest, it 's at 15%. I know that you do n't believe in government stepping in too much. But in this regard, if it can help people stay out of homeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Obama administration has launched several initiatives to try to cause mortgage companies to modify the mortgages. Honestly, we 've got financial counselors all across the United States working with people in crises. We 've yet to see one of those things actually happen. The, the banks are so bogged down with the short sales. They 're so large and so incompetent that - it is, has been a huge strain just to get people to actually respond in these situations. So, we 're not seeing the actual homelessness thing. I mean, there 's some definite percentage points there. But most folks are moving to a rental. And most folks are not unemployed. We are still under 10%. And so that means 90% are employed. Just a lot of them are underemployed, and they 've lost values in their home. And so they 're having to take a step back in their finances to hit solid ground to start again. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) But according to a new study, one out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreclosed on. And that figure is 15% in the Midwest. Liz Anne, end on you, the administration, how difficult a job to stem these foreclosures? @!LIZ-ANNE-SONDERS-@# You know, it 's an extremely difficult job. And I think there 's so only so much that can and should be done. What we, what we unfortunately know is that with the lax lending, with the lax regulatory oversight, with the rate environment, we, we put a lot of people in homes that in many cases they, they could n't even afford the first payment. So we have to be careful about not establishing the same conditions again for a problem down the road. So, I think what needs to be done is to try to maybe get these people into a rental situation, as opposed to just back into homeownership. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Do n't wan na go backwards. @!LIZ-ANNE-SONDERS-@# Yeah. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Liz Anne, thank you so much. @!LIZ-ANNE-SONDERS-@# Thanks, Robin. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Dave, have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!DAVE-RAMSEY-@1HOST# You too. Thanks. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) And now, Bianna Golodryga has the morning 's other major news, starting with a NASA scientist accused of spying. Bianna? '
