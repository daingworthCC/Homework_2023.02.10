221141 @!HUGH-DOWNS : Good evening. I 'm Hugh Downs. BARBARA WALTERS : And I 'm Barbara Walters. And this is 20/20 @!ANNOUNCER From ABC News, around the world and into your home, the stories that touch your life. This is 20/20 with Hugh Downs and Barbara Walters. Tonight, down these halls, behind these doors are scenes that will shock the world. Thousands of children, some perfectly normal, are locked in secret asylums. They 're castaways, treated like human refuse. Dr. BARBARA BASCOM, World Vision-Romania : These children are dying every day and it is a disaster. And the magnitude of this kind of a disaster we have n't seen during our lifetime @!ANNOUNCER Tom Jarriel inspected over half a dozen sites, went in unannounced. TOM JARRIEL, ABC News : Why are you putting us out? Why? ANNOUNCER : Tonight, new horrors in Romania, a disaster still unfolding. A two-part expos, " Shame of the Nation. " In big sky country, cowboys riding high, but they 're not Americans, they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shirt, Levis, belt and buckle @!ANNOUNCER Japanese are becoming American cattle ranchers, buying huge spreads, making some friends, but also some enemies @!RANCHER American boys fight for this country and the Japanese are not going to take it over. Never @!ANNOUNCER Why are they here? Lynn Sherr has the answer, " A Yen for Beef. " Plus, in The Little Rascals, he was a favorite. " Whatever Happened To Buckwheat? " You 'll be surprised. Those stories tonight, October 5th, 1990. Shame of a Nation WALTERS : Tonight, 20/20 begins with a dilemma, a story that 's so shocking that we know those of you at home are going to be disturbed by what you see, but a story that 's so important that we just could n't look the other way. Earlier this year, we reported on the plight of orphan children in Romania, which caused 25,000 of you to write to us. Now a new discovery. Thousands of Romanian children - many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held in hidden asylums that resemble Nazi concentration camps. Most of what we will show you has never been seen before on American television @!DOWNS This crisis is unfolding as we speak, but public exposure can force change. Just last weekend, 71 world leaders met at the United Nations to commit their countries to the long-term goal of improving the quality of life for children, but the situation in Romania demands immediate action. voice-over Tom Jarriel journeyed to Romania, where people - and particularly children - are still suffering from the totalitarian policies of the Ceausescu regime. Here now, in a two-part investigation, is what Tom found. TOM JARRIEL, ABC News : voice-over In more than 50 institutions hidden in remote areas of Romania, innocent children are locked away like condemned prisoners. These are not the orphanages seen before on American television. These are state-run asylums, shrouded in secrecy. This is where children with physical or mental defects are banished by a government which has branded them worthless. Conditions are so shameful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is why. Dr. BARBARA BASCOM, World Vision-Romania : Your immediate feeling about this is this is an extermination camp, that this is a place that 's designed to get rid of these children. And it 's being done in the most inhumane and undignified way possible @!JARRIEL voice-over Children here are filthy and unattended. They lie in their own waste, covered with flies, crippled by years of disease and confinement. They cower beneath cribs like cornered animals. on camera The eventually toll of living in such unsanitary conditions is obvious. In every institution we visited, we found critically ill children, some with perhaps only weeks left to live. And the attitude of the authorities? " It 's the system. There 's nothing we can do about it. " voice-over The Romanian government admits more than 8,000 children live in these state-run asylums, but Western sources say the figure is closer to 40,000, among them hundreds of perfectly normal children swept up by this heartless bureaucracy. This is the only life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. on camera It 's a system not unlike Hitler 's Auschwitz, a form of state-imposed genocide by neglect. At age three, the children in Romania 's orphanages are sorted into two categories. The " productive " ones, healthy and normal, are sent to be educated in state-run orphanages. voice-over The orphanages are far from perfect, but the children here are fed and clothed. The government is now raising 65,000 orphans as wards of the state. These are the lucky ones. on camera The rest are rejected and sent to medieval institutions like this one, warehouses for what 's called " the deficient and unsalvageable. " interviewing The nurse says both these children are going to die. Dr. BASCOM : These children are certainly doomed in terms of this kind of care @!JARRIEL voice-over Pediatrician Barbara Bascom was so overwhelmed by the misery she found here, she sold her home in Maryland and is devoting the next three years to what she calls " a man- made disaster. " Dr. BASCOM : These children are dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnitude of this kind of a disaster we have n't seen during our lifetime @!JARRIEL voice-over Another American, Ion Berindei, has set aside his career as a Boston architect, passionate in his zeal to help the country he escaped 20 years ago for freedom. After last December 's revolution, Ion returned to Romania, obsessed with saving the children his homeland has written off as hopeless. ION BERINDEI, Free Romania Foundation : She does n't know why she 's here. She says her mother left and maybe she will come back, but she does n't know @!JARRIEL voice-over In a quest for outside help. Ion used a home video camera to document the conditions he found inside the institutions. At one facility, he witnessed a brutal show of inhumanity at bath time. interviewing What was it like that day for the children? Mr. BERINDEI : It was horrifying for them because they were actually being beaten into coming into this- the children were shrieking. They were, in fact, being herded into the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a home video camera, seemed to confirm the eyewitness reports we were hearing from international relief workers. 20/20 set out to investigate. We traveled to Romania, criss-crossing the country, covering more than 1,500 miles in six days to find out how many children are trapped in this nightmare. Ion agreed to act as a translator and consultant for 20/20. Our first priority was Tuicani Moreni, the facility where Ion had seen the children terrorized by a nurse. We landed in an open field and headed for the institution with donated relief supplies. It had been two months since Ion had been here. It was quickly apparent not much had changed. Mr. BERINDEI : We can still see stationary water, the same black water that I saw two months ago. They may not even have changed it since then @!JARRIEL They were all washed in the same tub of water? Mr. BERINDEI : They were washed in the same tub of water and they were being pushed by two and three into black- looking water, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in @!JARRIEL voice-over The new director here was alerted of our arrival. interviewing Does he see anything with, and is the practice continuing, of taking youngsters into the shower area and putting them into a cold bath as if they are being herded like animals? Mr. BERINDEI : interpreting He says, " In medical pathology, it is a well-known fact that people working in places like this, they become like animals themselves. " JARRIEL : voice-over The director promised that the woman who had struck the children would be fired and explained there was simply no clean water available for bathing the children. But just a few yards away, an open water faucet ran constantly, flooding the ground. The director of this institution resigned the day after we left. We pressed on, 400 miles north, where conditions were said to be even worse. Destination : Siret, an old monastery which houses 520 children. We entered the dungeon-like building. Even on sunny days, these youngsters are kept inside. At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orphanages we had seen back in Bucharest. But as we went from room to room, down dark, dilapidated hallways, it became clear this place was different. We found children terrified of strangers. In some cribs, dazed toddlers were restrained in straight-jacket fashion. In the next room, a little boy was doubled over, oblivious to his surroundings. Dr. Barbara Bascom traveled with us. As a pediatrician, she could determine what problems had caused these children to be sent here. It was clear many had severe physical disabilities or were neurologically impaired. But Dr. Bascom also discovered a remarkable number of children with minor problems : crossed eyes or " Dumbo " ears, conditions routinely treated elsewhere. And in every room, there were children who appeared normal. Dr. BASCOM : I have no idea why these children are here @!JARRIEL voice-over These children, like thousands of others, have been misdiagnosed by this haphazard system. Others are abandoned gypsy children. Dr. BASCOM : I think 80 to 90 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or had normal potential at the time of birth. Mr. BERINDEI : They came as normal children and as a result of staying in this institution, they are no longer normal. They are now indistinguishable from the rest of children with severe neurological problems @!JARRIEL In fact, we 're going to the basement. The basement? voice-over The most hopeless cases, we discovered, are sent, for the their final weeks, to the basement, an anonymous death row. The children in this room are virtually ignored by a staff which has little medical training. When we asked what was wrong with this little boy, the aide simply shrugged. This child 's leg is now crooked, the result of a fracture that was never set. Dying children, each case more senseless than the last. interviewing This one especially seems to disturb you. Dr. BASCOM : I think this is an outrage. This child has been deemed unsalvageable because of anemia @!JARRIEL Is n't anemia something that can be fairly easily and successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of anemia are simple and very easy to completely reverse with proper treatment @!JARRIEL voice-over Dr. Bascom was astonished at the last of basic resources available in Romania. Dr. BASCOM : They do n't have the hospitals, the labs, the X-ray machines or any of the support services that are needed to make a diagnosis. You ca n't treat children without a diagnosis @!JARRIEL voice-over The only escape for this child now is death. They 're buried here in anonymous graves in a field segregated from the main cemetery. This is the state 's final solution. In one institution, 40 percent of the children died last year of infectious diseases and neglect. Remarkably, there 's been no public outcry to pressure the new government to deal with this crisis. DAN CRISTESCU, Inspector General, Special Education : through interpreter These children are like prisoners of war forgotten now that the war is over @!JARRIEL voice-over Dan Cristescu is Inspector General of Special Education in Romania. Mr. CRISTESCU : through interpreter Unfortunately, the general public 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!JARRIEL voice-over As we traveled on, we discovered firsthand how public indifference impacts on these children. Day three : we arrived at Ghimes, a farming town tucked away deep in a scenic valley. It 's a typical Romanian community where families are raising healthy, normal children. Every day on the main road, they pass by the yellow stone house with its padlocked front gate, but no one ever goes inside or asks if they can help. Such isolation is devastating to the children living inside these state-run asylums. Dr. BASCOM : He uses his peripheral vision, I think, a little bit @!JARRIEL voice-over Dr. Bascom found a child going blind from easily correctable cataracts, but no one had bothered to remove them. Another child had been labelled retarded because of a mild speech impediment, but Ion discovered he 's bilingual. He says he wants to go to school. There are no teachers here. Within minutes, Ion discovered a roomful of relief supplies, toys and clothing locked away unused in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the children. The staff is defensive when questioned about such inattention. interviewing We saw a child with cataracts. Why has n't that child had simple surgery to keep it from going blind? Mr. BERINDEI : interpretering He was born like this @!JARRIEL voice-over As for the toys, the nurse told us they were not distributed because the children would only destroy them. interviewing We saw a child in the other room with Downs syndrome. Normally, they are very friendly and outgoing. This child was frightened and shied away from us. He had a bruise over his eye. Is that child being abused here? Mr. BERINDEI : interpreting No. They are afraid of foreigners, of strangers @!JARRIEL voice-over Perhaps, but this is how the child reacted when we asked his nurse to approach him. Dr. BASCOM : I think when you come to this country and you see these children, it changes you forever, but it also fills you with a determination to try to return with the kind of assistance that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destined for exactly the same kind of unit in an institution for the unsalvageable @!JARRIEL voice-over At an orphanage in the city of Braila, a little girl was heading for just such a fate when she was spotted by Sonya Paterson. SONYA PATERSON, Romanian Orphans Support Group : The first thing that caught my attention was her nose. That was it, ' cause she has the same nose as me. And the orphanage director said to me, " Oh, forget that little girl. " Then she told me that Carmen was a child who they were going to send to a handicapped institution where they send the children who are the most severely handicapped @!JARRIEL voice-over The little girl was retarded, the director said, she did n't speak or respond to anyone. But Sonya and her husband decided they were willing to adopt a special needs child. While Sonya waited in Bucharest for the adoption to be finalized, she realized her new daughter was not brain-damaged. She was a product of years of institutional neglect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagnose developmental problems and they do n't know how to treat developmentally disabled children. To Mrs.. Paterson She 's very precise with her fingers @!JARRIEL voice-over Dr. Bascom agreed to administer a developmental test to Carmen. She checked motor skills and learning potential. She tested her ability imitate and solve problems. There was no question. The little girl had been misdiagnosed. Mrs. PATERSON : Toy. CARMEN, Romanian Orphan : imitating Toy. Mrs. PATERSON : Good. Say, " baby 's, " I 'm a baby @!CARMEN Baby. Mrs. PATERSON : Bravo. Mrs. PATERSON : I think of Carmen as being a cat with nine lives. She 's changed 100 percent just in one week that I 've had her. I think that when she gets older and I tell her that the orphanage director considered her to be irrecuperable, I just hope that she 's really happy that we took her away @!WALTERS Well, that 's a happy ending, but in Part Two of his report, Tom Jarriel enters an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly embarrassed @!JARRIEL Why are you putting us out? Why? WALTERS : voice-over More of " The Shame of a Nation " right after this. Commercial break DOWNS : We continue now with our report, " The Shame of a Nation, " Tom Jarriel 's investigation of a really horrible tragedy befalling children in Romania. And again, this is not an update of previous stories about orphaned and AIDS babies in Romania @!WALTERS No, these are new revelations of children labeled as handicapped or just undesirable, who are dumped in concentration-type asylums all across Romania. Tom Jarriel is opening the doors and our eyes to these conditions. Now, just to get our bearings, Tom 's travels in Romania began in the capital, Bucharest. He then flew to Romania 's northern border and the back to points East and West, a total of more than 1,500 miles @!JARRIEL voice-over The last leg of our six-day journey was a gamble. Security at the next institution was said to be so tight that no one had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transylvania, then we 'll fly here. It 's right on the Russian border @!JARRIEL All right. What have you heard about this place? Mr. BERINDEI : It 's a terrible place @!KOPPEL voice-over The institution at Sighetu Marmatiei was off the main road, behind a barbed-wire fence, secured with a locked gate and watched by a guard. Ion tricked the guard into unlocking the gate and we all stormed in unannounced. Even after all we had seen, we were unprepared for what we found in an upstairs room. Here, young girls, their heads shaven, were kept in a giant cage like animals : wild-eyed, screaming, half-naked, splashing in urine and excrement on the filthy floor. As the staff tried to quickly put clothing on them, we were ordered out. on camera Why are you putting us out? Why? JARRIEL : voice-over Downstairs, we confronted the director in his office. Mr. BERINDEI : interpreting He 's saying, " No cameras. " He would rather not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicity is because of the conditions. Why are hundreds of children naked, living in filthy conditions? They are living in conditions that they 'll die unless you change it. voice-over As we persisted, Barbara made a discovery. Right in the corner of the director 's office, she found powerful tranquilizers. interviewing Do you use tranquilizers with the children? Obviously, you do. Dr. EVA IVANOVICH, Staff Physician : Da. Da. Yes. Yes @!JARRIEL Yes, and that 's routine to keep them quiet, to keep them under control? Dr. IVANOVICH : Da. Yeah, yeah @!JARRIEL They say they use them as part of the routine treatment. Dr. BASCOM : Routine treatment of what? This is appropriate for adult psychiatric patients who are agitated and are uncontrollable physically. This is totally inappropriate medication for children. This is chemical restraints. It 's as much as putting a rope on a child and tying him into a crib @!JARRIEL voice-over It did n't take long before Barbara found children sedated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this day and time, for this child? Dr. BASCOM : Absolutely not. He 'll simply give up @!JARRIEL He 'll be lost? Dr. BASCOM : That 's right. Physically, he could live a long time, but psychologically, this child will be completely lost @!JARRIEL voice-over Despite Dr. Bascom 's protests, the staff retied this little boy as soon as we left the room. Across the hall, a death wail alerted us to a four-year-old child clinging to life. This pathetic little boy is named Ferenti. He 's not dying of an incurable illness like AIDS. Dr. BASCOM : This child has cerebral palsy, but this is not what 's killing this child. This child is dying of malnutrition @!JARRIEL This is an image from death camps. This is an image from Ethiopia 's starvation. Dr. BASCOM : But those children, there was always a mother. These children are dying deaths without any comfort, without anyone even holding their little hands @!JARRIEL Doctor, this child appears to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't he in a hospital. Mr. BERINDEI : interpreting This is because these are nobody 's children. No one wants to take them into the hospital @!JARRIEL voice-over As if to compound this tragedy, the pediatric hospital which refused to admit this child is located less than 100 feet away. Twelve noon : we were allowed back inside the cage at the institution. It was meal time. The food budget here is set by the government : 38 cents per day per child. We watched as a watery soup of broth and bread heels was shoveled into hungry mouths. Many of the children had never been taught to feed themselves. While the staff hurriedly fed half the children, just a few feet away, others were put on plastic potties in a bizarre daily routine that combines toilet time with meal time. For Ion, it was the breaking point. Mr. BERINDEI : These are human beings, for God 's sake. These are human beings @!JARRIEL You 're a Romanian. To see this in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BERINDEI : This would move me anywhere, Tom, anywhere in the world. This is not acceptable. But it 's happening here in Romania today. How can an institution and a society come so low that they forget basic respect for life? And I know we can make a change. I know we can improve this situation for these children @!JARRIEL voice-over Nine months after the revolution the callous disregard for human life in this insane system seems unchanged. The Ministry of Labor ran these institutions during Ceausescu 's regime. We asked the newly-appointed minister why these death camps still operate? CATALIN ZAMFIR, Minister of Labor &amp; Social Welfare : It 's difficult to say that this type of situation can totally change overnight, but I think, in the last months, have been many improvements in the conditions of life of these children @!JARRIEL Let me show you something that may shock you. These are some conditions we found in institutions just in the past few days. This child is literally starving to death. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have a small death row of children waiting to die. We ca n't talk in the past. The children are still in these institutions. Is anything being done about this? Mr. ZAMFIR : This point, I think, has to be very clear. Nobody in Romania wants these things to happen again. We need doctors, we need psychologists, we need sociologists. But our problem is that we have train these people and this will be the turning point @!JARRIEL voice-over The post-revolution Romania is overwhelmed by the aftermath of 25 years of totalitarian rule. A solution to this problem is years away. Until then, the children who live in these God-forsaken places must depend on the help of outsiders. Ion Berindei has now inspected 26 of the institutions for the unsalvageable to determine where the need is most urgent. Back in Boston, he has set up the Free Romania Foundation to put together a team of U.S. doctors, therapists and teachers to return with him to Romania. Dr. BASCOM : This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice- over Dr. Bascom is working full-time with the World Vision organization, fighting an uphill battle to convince Romanian doctors that some of these children could be saved with simple surgery or physical therapy. For now, Barbara is forced to rescue these kids one child at a time. She 's currently hiding a little boy with club feet away from authorities while she searches for an adoptive home. Dr. BASCOM : I was greeted with disbelief that there would be homes that would welcome a child with a handicap @!JARRIEL voice-over This child has won a special place in her heart. Twenty-five years ago, Barbara adopted a son in the United States born with the identical condition. Dr. BASCOM : If this child has to leave this orphanage, he will go to an orphanage for the handicapped or for the non- recoverable @!JARRIEL So, the non-recoverable policy still continues? It still is perpetuated even today? Dr. BASCOM : That 's the system 's policy. If, in five years, the system is completely corrected, it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be permanently disabled. He must have this corrected very soon @!JARRIEL voice-over As time runs out for four-year-old Vacily, Barbara has intensified her efforts to find parents for this little boy. But for now, most of these children are destined to remain exactly where they are and they seem resigned to that fact. This little girl is blind and has been institutionalized most of her life. When we last saw her, she was singing the Romanian anthem of liberation. It goes, " Ol, Ol, Ceausescu is no more. " But she had changed the words. " Ol, Ol. Ceausescu is with us still. " WALTERS : Tom, we 've many different features on this program that have moved us, but I 'm sure the audience feels just as disturbed as we are. What can people who are watching do? JARRIEL : Barbara, medical technology and doctors, of course, are badly needed, but for the average viewer probably donations to some of the many reputable, well-organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this problem would be a good start @!DOWNS It 's moving and infuriating, but I ca n't accept the idea that the Romanian people are themselves either cruel or thoughtless. It surely must be the brutalization of being under the regime of a dictator who was at least as bad as Stalin was in Russia @!JARRIEL Hugh, I think that mindset of 25 years is still continuing, which is why the people of Romania do n't see this as a problem. It 's been a way of life. Also, Barbara, you were concerned about adoption @!WALTERS Adopting. I know we 're going to hear from a lot of people who want to adopt these children @!JARRIEL Yes, and certainly, these are adoptable children. That may not be the overall answer to this, but they 're adoptable and that would help the ones that can be taken out @!WALTERS But it 's an awful lot of red tape, as we know from viewers who have written to us before @!JARRIEL Yes, and for those viewers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mail from our earlier reports @!WALTERS Tom, we thank you for bringing this to our attention and hope we bring to the world 's attention @!DOWNS Thank you, Tom. We 're going to turn next to something very different. It 's a story developing in this country, Japanese cowboys in the American West. voice-over They are becoming cattle ranchers and not everybody is happy about it. Lynn Sherr reports, " A Yen for Beef. " Commercial break A Yen for Beef WALTERS : Our next stop : the American West, where the Marlboro Man has a new neighbor, the Japanese cowboy. Japanese are buying cattle ranches, vast spreads. They 're a hot new attraction for Japanese money that 's been pouring into this country. And this worries many people, even though other foreigners have purchased much more property. Japanese moving in makes some people resentful. voice-over Lynn Sherr showsus what 's behind the new land rush. The West still looks the same, but instead of " Happy trails, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHERR, ABC News : The American West. What better symbol of the spirit that built this country? Wide open spaces, rugged individualism, a time and a place idealized and immortalized by countless Western movies : High Noon, Gunfight at the OK Corral. Did n't we all want to be cowboys? Well, as it turns out, some folks still do. Here in Montana 's big sky country and in other rugged Western locales, there 's been a recent invasion by tenderfeet from back East, way back East. voice-over Meet the newest hands at the Lazy 8 Ranch in Dillon, Montana, a ranch now owned by the Japanese. Officially, it 's Zenchiku Land &amp; Livestock, 77,000 acres of scenic Western real estate complete with nearly 3,000 head of cattle. For the owners, Tokyo 's top beef suppliers, it 's a business venture, a $12.6-million investment to provide American steaks for the Japanese market. But for two future Zenchiku executives, young men being trained to understand American ranching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Kaz, still ca n't get over the differences between crowded Tokyo and this setting. KAZUHIRU SOMA, Zenchiku Trainee : Landscapes and fresh air, less cars, less people @!SHERR voice-over Tommy Fukutomi says his cowboy dreams were fueled by Western movies and movie stars. TOMMY FUKUTOMI, Zenchiku Trainee : I saw Magnificent Seven and movie stars Clint Eastwood or John Wayne @!SHERR Were they your heroes? Mr. FUKUTOMI : Yes @!SHERR voice-over Riding the range like their Hollywood heroes is not without irony. The American Western, The Magnificent Seven, was actually based on a Japanese film, The Seven Samurai. But if Japanese movies have influenced us, we 've got something they want, U.S.-bred beef. Mr. SOMA : Our purpose is to produce beef for Japanese people, you know. That is the focus for us @!SHERR voice-over In Japan, the appetite for beef is growing ravenous, further whetted by TV commercials. Sixty percent of the cows of the Lazy 8 will wind up on Japanese dinner plates. Seventy percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're buying nearly a billion dollars a year of American-raised beef, a market expected to double once Japanese quotas on beef imports are lifted next spring. And Japanese businesses are positioning themselves to cash in. on camera They 're buying not only American ranches, but feedlots and packing houses, getting a handle on the beef business from calving to roundup to rib eyes. voice-over Since 1987, the Japanese have invested heavily in the U.S. beef industry, with holdings spread over five Western states. While that aggressive Japanese spending concerns some, it actually totals well under one percent of U.S. ranch land. JOHN W. MORSE, Jr., President, Zenchiku Land &amp; Livestock : The Japanese are not taking over the West @!SHERR voice-over John Morse, a former official with the National Cattlemen 's Association, was hired by the Japanese to be president of Zenchiku Land &amp; Livestock. Mr. MORSE : The Japanese are not telling us how to run this ranch. We 're not rounding up our cattle on Hondas or any such things. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology and the most appropriate technology. In some cases, that 's going to be horses. It may not be modern, but it 's appropriate @!SHERR voice-over For the Japanese trainees, learning the ways of the Old West has become a most unusual manner of climbing the modern Zenchiku corporate ladder. That means rising before dawn, when the Lazy 8 cowpunchers get their daily assignments from foreman Ed Freyer. Since the Lazy 8 is one of the biggest ranches in Montana 's biggest county, it means long hours and hard work, with chores far less romantic than the movies would have it. Did Gary Cooper ever mend a fence? Did Clint Eastwood ever lay irrigation pipe? interviewing What is your favorite thing that you do on the ranch? Mr. SOMA : Oh, my favorite is horseback riding. I can feel Montana on horseback @!SHERR voice-over Until they learn to stay on their horses, the greenhorns, Kaz and Tommy, also felt Montana 's dust, but after the first of his two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. GARY JAMES, Foreman : He does pretty good. He tries hard and that's- in my opinion, that 's 90 percent of being a cowboy @!SHERR voice-over Maybe the other ten percent is dressing the part. With typical Japanese attention to detail, Kaz has put together just the right look. Mr. SOMA : Cowboy hat and shirt, Levis, belt and buckle @!SHERR The buckle says? Mr. SOMA : " Montana. " SHERR : " Montana "? Mr. SOMA : Yeah @!SHERR Okay. Mr. SOMA : And chaps and cowboy boots and these and spurs @!SHERR It 's a complete outfit. Mr. SOMA : Yeah @!SHERR A perfect cowboy. Mr. SOMA : Ah, yeah, looks like @!SHERR voice-over But Kaz knows he wo n't be in boots and spurs forever. One year from now, he 'll be back home in Japan, back in a business suit and tie, applying his cowboy 's eye view of ranching to the management end of the business. And he knows, too, that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still an outsider, that for all the friendliness of most folks out here, some people just do n't want to share the American West with the Japanese. interviewing Have you noticed any resentment, people saying, " Oh, my God, the Japanese are taking over our West "? Mr. MORSE : Oh, clearly and we 're sensitive to that as an issue. And I think 10 percent of the people do n't like foreigners, but they do n't mean Japanese, they mean Californians. They mean any outsider @!SHERR voice-over Still, the Japanese outsiders have been the most recent target. The local paper even ran a cartoon speculating about cows mooing in Japanese. To some, it was no laughing matter @!RANCHER American boys fight for this country and the Japanese are not going to take it over. Never @!SHERR voice-over This man was an uninvited guest at a gathering of Zenchiku employees. His tirade reflects the hostility by some who fought the Japanese in World War II. But the Japanese are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West. In fact, the British and the Canadians have far more extensive holdings here than the Japanese and so do the French and the Swiss. Investors from the Eastern U.S. - insurance companies and Ted Turner, for instance - have also bought big spreads. Many here, like Zane Berthelson, are angered because the West no longer belongs to Westerners. ZANE BERTHELSON, Dell, Montana Resident : Rich money from back East or overseas is buying the ranches. We ca n't get them. My kids will never have one @!SHERR voice-over Zane 's father is n't upset by outside ownership. KEN BERTHELSON, Restaurant Owner : I do n't never let nothing bother me, not even the weather. The hell with it @!SHERR voice-over The Japanese do n't bother Ken Berthelson because they 've been good for his business. He owns Yesterday 's Calf-A where any customer who comes in with a traditional craving for beef is welcome. No concern about fat or cholesterol here. KEN BERTHELSON : Not a damn thing. Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice-over That 's all they needed in the movies, too. In The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, everyone wanted steak. Sidekicks ate it, bad guys ate it and when the situation necessitated, heroes were ready to fight for it. interviewing What do you think John Wayne would have thought of all of this? Mr. MORSE : Oh, well, he might not like it. For starters, if you were to come into our office and he noticed the slippers where you 're supposed to leave your boots, he probably would think that was a kind of strange development @!SHERR voice-over But, Morse says, even the Duke would have to acknowledge today 's economic realities. Mr. MORSE : The romanticism that we 've had out here in the West, that 's fine and dandy, but you ca n't eat the view @!SHERR voice-over These are tough times for American cattlemen. Unlike their forebears in the Old West, Americans are simply eating less beef. In effect, we 're adopting Japanese eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time as they 're acquiring ours. So Western ranch owners may need to broaden their horizons. Mr. MORSE : Our goal is not to become Japanese. Our goal is to become international and serve an international market @!SHERR You 're a cowboy yourself. What do you think when you see a young Japanese man sitting on top of a horse, doing a cattle roundup. Mr. MORSE : There 's been all this Japan-bashing and pretty strong feelings out there, but when confronted with a Japanese kid riding a horse - and cowboys are really stoic, hard-core kind of people - they take him in as their own @!SHERR voice-over For his last night at the Lazy 8 before returning to Tokyo, Tommy Fukutomi was honored with a party. The ranch hands chipped in to buy him a pair of spurs, symbol of the Old West, a way of life that is changing before their eyes. Tommy and Kaz are part of that change. But on this night, there was no contention, no resentment, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him feel so much at home on the range. Mr. FUKUTOMI : Every Montana people is very kindly for me and very friendly. I never forget anybody. I never forget. Thank you very much. I will come back, maybe, I hope come back again. Thank you very much @!SHERR voice-over As the Dillon Junior Fiddlers played on, Tommy headed off, just like his Western heroes, into the sunset @!DOWNS Well, it seems, Lynn, that by and large, they 're being accepted. It did take a bit of an adjustment, though, I guess @!SHERR It did. As a matter of fact, the first problem was the two young Japanese were told that the 40-mile-long ranch is the same distance as from Norita Airport to downtown Tokyo, so this was a major adjustment for them. And then Kaz, the young man we showed you, is a black belt in judo and he tried to use his judo to wrestle one of the cattle to the ground at branding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did n't work @!DOWNS I 'll bet Kobe beef would have @!SHERR Exactly @!DOWNS Are they trying to raise a different kind of beef? SHERR : Well, there is a slight difference. Americans prefer their beef- we like it lean and we like value for our money. The Japanese prefer a fattier beef and they want quality, so they will pay top dollar for a more marbled, fattier beef. So that 's what they 're going to be doing for them @!DOWNS That 's great. That 's marvelous. Thank you very much, Lynn @!SHERR Sure @!WALTERS Well, do you remember The Little Rascals? When we come back, Hugh will answer " Whatever Happened to Buckwheat? " Commercial break Whatever Happened to Buckwheat? WALTERS : This week, our " Whatever Happened To " is a child actor from decades past. He was one of a kind, but part of a gang. We 're talking about Buckwheat of The Little Rascals. The Rascals comedy films made their d but as movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50s brought them back for television and now, they 're on videocassette. So whatever happened to " Buckwheat "? Here 's Hugh @!DOWNS voice-over Remember Buckwheat and his friends Spanky, Porky, Alfalfa and Darla? We knew them as The Little Rascals and they were as familiar to us as the kid next door. The children in the cast were picked for their looks, not for their acting experience. That 's how William Thomas 's mother got him the role of Buckwheat at age three. The producers liked his expressive eyes and his infectious grin and especially the unique way he spoke, so they offered him a contract for $40 a week. Buckwheat made 93 of the short comedies in all, working on the series until he was ten years old. When his contract expired in 1944, he dropped out of show business and moved to New York with his mother. So whatever happened to Buckwheat? At 56, Buckwheat - and he still likes to be called Buckwheat - lives in Tempe, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother remarried and he got a new last name. He never got to keep any of the money for the acting he did. There were no unions then or child protection laws, so he 's had a variety of jobs through the years, like hotel doorman and restaurant manager. We found him at Smitty 's Supermarket, where he 's the most popular bagger for miles around. He wo n't sign autographs because he says if he did, he 'd never get any work done. He says he 'd like to act again, but not in comedies this time. He wants to be in a gangster movie. He also says that if he had his life to live over, he 'd do exactly the same thing. All he needs is to feel useful. BILL ENGLISH, " Buckwheat " : You serve your public in some way - I do n't know how you put it - but you just do n't sit down and think about yourself. You should be out there doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself or doing for yourself, may I say @!DOWNS He 's a good guy @!WALTERS Nice man. You know, so many young people today know about Buckwheat from Eddie Murphy 's take-off on him @!DOWNS That 's right. You know, I think it 's noteworthy, too, that that show was integrated. considering it was shot in the ' 30 's and ' 40 's and Buckwheat attended classes with all of the Little Rascals at a time when classrooms were n't uniformly integrated @!WALTERS True @!DOWNS Well, now, we have a follow-up to a report by Lynn Sherr from last January, titled " Is He a Killer? " DOWNS : voice-over This is Joe Giarratano who is on death row for the brutal slaying of two Virginia women in 1979. Giarratano, who had a severe drug problem, confessed to the crime even though he could n't remember it. He was convicted without a jury trial. But on death row, he rehabilitated himself, became a noted jailhouse lawyer, uncovered evidence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. A coalition of prominent conservatives and liberals support his request for a new trial. on camera That 's where we left off, but this week, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the request. Now, unless Virginia Governor Douglas Wilder stays the execution, Joe Giarratano will likely die in Virginia 's electric chair. No date has been set. So, tonight you 're going to be anchoring Nightline in place of Ted Koppel @!WALTERS Yes, I am tonight, Hugh. And we 're looking forward to talking with the beautiful and very intelligent American-born wife of Jordan 's King Hussein, that 's Queen Noor. And she 's in the country, we 'll be talking with her. We 'll also bring the latest on the budget crisis, so we hope that you will join us. That 's Nightline after your local news @!DOWNS We 'll be tuned in. Well, that is 20/20 for tonight. We thank you for being with us @!WALTERS And as always, we 're in touch, so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm Hugh Downs @!WALTERS And for everyone here, good night and we hope you have a good weekend. See you later.
