5000041 @5830-AM-EDT@6 @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : Welcome back to CBS THIS MORNING. Right now it 's time to show you some of this morning 's headlines from around the globe. Britain 's Guardian reports on a study that suggests eating junk food raises the risk of depression. A study in molecular psychiatrist looked at forty-one previous studies and researchers found that foods containing a lot of fat or sugar or that was processed led to inflammation. And then the study says that chronic inflammation can negatively affect brain chemistry. It can also impact neurotransmitters that are responsible for food -- for mood regulation. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Say what you will, John, I 'm not giving up a cupcake. You can not make me do it. @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : Well -- @1BIANNA-GOLODRYGA@2 : You 're the outlier, Gayle. @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : Yeah. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Yes, I 'll be the outlier. There 's nothing depressing to me about that. @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : Yeah, that 's a baked good. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Okay. @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : I think they 're talking about fast foods, you know -- @1BIANNA-GOLODRYGA@2 : Deep fried. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got one hand on the wheel. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Okay, I like that too. The Wall Street Journal reports -- @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : We 're trying to find you an exit ramps. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : The Wall Street Journal reports shoppers love those rewards credit cards -- we sure do -- but retailers hate them. Ninety-two percent of all U.S. credit card purchase volume is currently charged on those rewards credit cards. Retailers are trying to end the Honor All Cards rule, which requires merchants that accept Visa or MasterCard branded cards to take all of them. Retailers pay a fee when customers swipe. Large merchants including Target, Home Depot, and Amazon are pushing for the right to reject some rewards credit cards which typically carry higher fees. Retailers paid more than forty-three billion dollars in Visa and MasterCard credit fees last year alone. @1BIANNA-GOLODRYGA@2 : And USA Today says actor Will Smith celebrated his fiftieth birthday by bungee jumping out of a helicopter near the Grand Canyon. John Dickerson was desperate to go with him, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Yeah. @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : Yeah. @1BIANNA-GOLODRYGA@2 : Smith conquered his fear of heights live on a YouTube show that challenges people to face their biggest fears. He described it as going from pure terror to absolute bliss. The event helped raise money for Global Citizen 's education campaigns. It 's a good cause. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : CBS roo -- let 's try that again -- take two. @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : Reboot. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Say it again? @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : Reboot. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : CBS reboot of Murphy Brown is one of this fall 's most highly- anticipated shows and picks up twenty years after the finale. The hit comedy first aired back in 1988, starring Candice Bergen as a tough talking TV journalist ; actress Faith Ford played the perky TV reporter named Corky. Murphy Brown was considered a groundbreaking show at the time winning eighteen Emmys over ten seasons. It portrayed a career-focused independent woman. The way the series tackle important issues like politics and family values made a lasting impact on our culture. @5Excerpt-from-Murphy-@7 @1GAYLE-KING@2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table. Good morning. @1CANDICE-BERGEN@2 @5Actress-and-Executiv@7 : Good morning. @1FAITH-FORD@2 @5Actress-Murphy-Brow@7 : Good morning. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Welcome, welcome, welcome. I am so excited about this reboot because, of course, I remember Murphy Brown. But when you look at those clips, she seems very gentle compared to what we see now. She was ahead of her time, was n't she, Candice? @1CANDICE-BERGEN@2 : Yeah. She was as it turns out. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Yeah. @1CANDICE-BERGEN@2 : I do n't think we realize just quite how edgy was when she was created. Diane English wrote a woman that we had n't really seen on television yet, who was a woman totally self-confident, did n't care what other people thought, did n't -- no -- no politeness, no groveling. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : And twenty years later, she 's still that girl. @1CANDICE-BERGEN@2 : Yeah. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Twenty years later, she 's still that girl. You have said -- @1CANDICE-BERGEN@2 : Yeah. A pain in the neck. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you have said if there was n't the election of Donald Trump, you might not have the show. What do you mean? @1CANDICE-BERGEN@2 : Well, we -- we definitely would n't have had the show because really we -- we 've done the show and we 've done it as well, I think, as it had ever been done. And we did n't have a -- a motivation do it. We did n't really have the -- the meat or a story. And then when the election happened, I mean, if Hillary had won, we -- we would just be dancing in the streets. But I think in the current situation, it gives us a chance to make a response. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : But we should say, Faith, it 's not a Donald Trump bashing show either. That 's the beauty of it as well. @1FAITH-FORD@2 : No, it 's not. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Yeah. @1FAITH-FORD@2 : It 's really not. It 's -- we -- we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really are a lot of issues going on that were going on then -- @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Mm-Hm. @1FAITH-FORD@2 : -- and they 're still going on. And we 're dealing with theme very week and predominantly what our show 's about. @1BIANNA-GOLODRYGA@2 : And you do offer opinions on certain issues, though, and you see where you 're headed and your minds are. Are you concerned at all about abandoning viewers? @1CANDICE-BERGEN@2 : Are you, Faith? @1FAITH-FORD@2 : We never were before. @1CANDICE-BERGEN@2 : Because I do n't want to answer that. @1FAITH-FORD@2 : Well, I have to say for all those people in the middle of -- I mean, I speak for the world because I live in Louisiana when I 'm not in New York. I 've sort of always lived in the middle and I see myself that way. I understand both sides. I love Republicans as well as Democrats in -- in real life and so I believe there 's a way for our country to get along no matter what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @1BIANNA-GOLODRYGA@2 : Hm. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Mm-Hm. @1FAITH-FORD@2 : You know, it really does. @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : Candice, what was it like -- was Murphy Brown living in your head during those twenty years that you were n't on the show? What was it like to reconnect with that character? @1CANDICE-BERGEN@2 : She -- she was n't actively, you know, ransacking the house of my head, but she 's never far away and she was by far the best character I 've ever gotten to play. I mean, she was a great, great character. She is a great character. @1FAITH-FORD@2 : She is. @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : Yeah. @1FAITH-FORD@2 : And Candice, I must say now in this, she 's so relaxed in this -- in this human being. And that 's the way you want somebody who 's been in this business, in the news business to be. You know, she 's coming back, but she 's not shrieking. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Yes. @1FAITH-FORD@2 : She 's not shrill. @1GAYLE-KING@2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and present and purposeful in her delivery. I mean, it 's just -- we talk about it -- when you 're not listening we talk about it all the time. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Yeah. @1FAITH-FORD@2 : Is n't she just amazing? @1GAYLE-KING@2 : And she 's still super smart. One of the great -- @1FAITH-FORD@2 : Mm-Hm. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : -- one of the interesting storylines because, you know, when you had Avery back in the day that was a scandal of sorts, a single woman having this baby. @1CANDICE-BERGEN@2 : Of sorts. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Yeah, that was a -- that was a big scandal. Fast forward to 2018, it 's like, oh, okay -- @1CANDICE-BERGEN@2 : Mm-Hm. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : -- we 're -- we 're throwing baby showers for single women. But now Avery, your son, is on a competing morning show. You guys have one morning show, Murphy in the Morning. Avery 's on a competing morning show called the Wolf Network -- @1CANDICE-BERGEN@2 : Mm-Hm. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conservative -- a conservative network. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : A very conservative network, Wolf. And I think that 's going to be some of the most fun moments on the show. What it -- what was that like, that dynamic between the two of you? @1CANDICE-BERGEN@2 : Oh, I love working with Jake. Jake McDorman is -- is, of course, dashingly handsome -- @1FAITH-FORD@2 : He 's a sweetheart. @1CANDICE-BERGEN@2 : -- and everybody on the set has a crush on him. But he 's also -- he just misses nothing and he has a great sense of humor. And so working with him is just a joy. @1JOHN-DICKERSON@2 : And, Faith, what was it like coming back for you to this show after such a long period away? @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Is it like riding a bike? @1FAITH-FORD@2 : Oh. Well, you know, we all sort of had to work on our pacing a little bit because it got very single camera like with comedy and it 's sort of like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's -- what 's been relaxing about it is that we 're back to doing it the way it used to be, like, where it 's a play. But the differences is that I guess we -- we try to slow down a little bit, I 'm trying to slow down, because when I deliver Corky, I mean, I immediately go to another level. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Yes. @1FAITH-FORD@2 : Whole another level. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Yes. @1FAITH-FORD@2 : And so it 's sort of finding that cadence right -- just the right. But we actually flow with each other, the -- the core. And what was great for us is seeing the new characters, like Tyne Daly is fantastic. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that 's right. @1BIANNA-GOLODRYGA@2 : Yeah, she 's great. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : She plays Phyllis. @1FAITH-FORD@2 : And she just owns that. I ca n't even imagine that anybody else have that bar. I mean, she 's literally gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she plays all the time. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : I ca n't imagine anybody in any of the roles. I 'm so glad you guys are back. And Corky, by the way, has hot flashes I think. @1FAITH-FORD@2 : Yes. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : That 's very relatable, Faith Ford. @1FAITH-FORD@2 : Corky has hot flashes. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Yes. Very relatable. @1FAITH-FORD@2 : Special. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Thank you, guys. @1FAITH-FORD@2 : Thank you. @1CANDICE-BERGEN@2 : Thank you. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Candice Berg -- Candice Bergen -- her name has not changed -- Faith Ford, thank you guys. The new Murphy Brown premieres tomorrow night at nine-thirty/eight central right here on CBS. @1CANDICE-BERGEN@2 : The mothership. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : The mothership. @1BIANNA-GOLODRYGA@2 : The mothership. Well, we 've got more for you because comedian Sebastian Maniscalco shows are a sellouts at huge arenas. But he 's hardly a household name. Yes. Right now he 's in our Toyota Green Room with why he says that 's just the way he likes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @1GAYLE-KING@2 : He 's like, what? I 'm a household name? @1BIANNA-GOLODRYGA@2 : But first, a check of your local weather. @5LOCAL-WEATHER-BREAK@6 @5ANNOUNCEMENTS@6
