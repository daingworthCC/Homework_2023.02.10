237441 @!CONTENT : PRESIDENT GEORGE W BUSH, CONGRESS, US COMBAT TROOPS, CONDOLEEZZA RICE, 9/11, AL QAEDA, GENERAL DAVID PETRAEUS, GENERAL TOMMY FRANKS, WHITE HOUSE, SADDAM HUSSEIN, REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI, AL ANBAR PROVINCE, PAT BUCHANAN, REPUBLICANS, AMBASSADOR RYAN CROCKER @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1ABC# @(Off-camera) But first, that high-stakes game of double dare going on in Washington late last night. The House voting to bring combat troops home from Iraq by April 1st, 2008. @!DIANE-SAWYER-@1ABC# @(Voiceover) Let 's go straight to David Wright, who is outside the White House this morning. David? @GRAPHICS @GRAPHICS @!DAVID-WRIGHT-@1ABC# @(Off-camera) Good morning, Diane. No sooner did the President, in his 38th news conference, lay out his justification for sticking to his guns in Iraq, that the **25;232;TOOLONG House sent a defiant message back, passing a bill that would start bringing the troops home in 120 days. @!SPEAKER-OF-THE-HOU# The bill is passed. @!DAVID-WRIGHT-@1ABC# The bill, passed last night on a mostly party line vote, would complete the pullout by April 1st of next year. Of course, the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veto. He seems confident history will prove him right. @!PRESIDENT-GEORGE-W# When it 's all said and done, Ed, when you ever come down and visit the old, old tired me down there in Crawford, I will be able to say I looked in the mirror and made decisions based upon principle. @!DAVID-WRIGHT-@1ABC# @(Voiceover) The President stopped short of accepting full responsibility for any possible mistakes. For instance, he was asked whether he should have sent more troops to Iraq from the start, or should have foreseen the sectarian strife that has followed. @!PRESIDENT-GEORGE-W# Those are all legitimate questions that I 'm sure historians will analyze. @!DAVID-WRIGHT-@1ABC# @(Voiceover) He seems to think that historians should take a hard look at the general in charge at the time. @!DAVID-WRIGHT-@1ABC# My primary question to General Franks was, do you have what it takes to succeed? And do you have what it takes to succeed after you succeed in removing Saddam Hussein? And his answer was, ' Yeah. " @!DAVID-WRIGHT-@1ABC# @(Voiceover) President Bush now argues a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should stay there and for how long. @!PRESIDENT-GEORGE-W# I 'm gon na wait to see what David has to say. I 'm not gon na prejudge what he may say. I trust David Petraeus - his judgment. @!PAT-BUCHANAN-@1CON# We do n't know what the Bush legacy is now because we do n't know for certain how the war is gon na come out. But clearly, it does not look good for the United States or for the President 's place in history. @!DAVID-WRIGHT-@1ABC# @(Off-camera) Well, the President is trying to buy a bit more time, at least until General Petraeus 's report comes out in mid-September. Although, he does acknowledge the country is suffering from war fatigue. And there was more bad news for him here in Washington last night. Four House Republicans defected to vote for that pullout bill despite White House efforts to keep them in line. George? @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Okay. David Wright, thanks very much. From the White House, we 're now gon na go to the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joins us. Good morning, Madam Secretary. And let 's begin with that House vote. By next April, American combat troops would have been in Iraq for five full years. Why should n't they be home? @!CONDOLEEZZA-RICE-@# Well, American forces have been in Iraq to liberate Iraq from Saddam Hussein and to try and help do something that has never been done in the Middle East, which is to establish a basis for a democratic government that will be a real fighter in the war on terror. And so it 's a difficult job. @GRAPHICS @!CONDOLEEZZA-RICE-@# And when the President gets his report from General Petraeus and from Ambassador Crocker in September, we can chart a coherent way forward. But we are, right now, still in the midst of the new strategy that the President announced in January. And so letting that strategy play out and then making the assessment when our people on the ground are ready to make that assessment, I think, is the wisest course. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) But, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Iraqis would have to pay a price if they did n't follow through on their promises. And yesterday 's report shows they have not yet followed through. Look at what the President said in January. @!PRESIDENT-GEORGE-W# I have made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq 's other leaders that America 's commitment is not open-ended. If the Iraqi government does not follow through on its promises, it will lose the support of the American people. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) The Iraqi government is losing the support of the American people. It 's losing support in Congress. When will President Bush hold them accountable? @!CONDOLEEZZA-RICE-@# Well, the President is absolutely clear that we do n't have limitless patience and, in fact, we all, every day practically, talk to the Iraqis about the need to do more. But we should n't dismiss as inconsequential what they have achieved in this period of time, bringing security forces to the fight. Yes, security forces that still need a lot of help, but security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're acting in a less sectarian way, their security forces are. And something that 's not on that list of, of benchmarks, but may be the most consequential development, and that is that the sheikhs in Al Anbar province, which used to be the most dangerous province in all of Iraq, are turning against al Qaeda. @!CONDOLEEZZA-RICE-@# They 're taking back their streets from these terrorists, and they 're doing it in coordination and cooperation with American forces. And so, yes, we would wan na see more progress and there has to be more progress... @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) What specifically... @!CONDOLEEZZA-RICE-@#... but it is not inconsequential what they 've achieved at this point. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) What specifically does the Iraqi government have to do by September to sustain US support? @!CONDOLEEZZA-RICE-@# Well, I, I think the Iraqis know, and I, I - by September, we will have a report on where we are in September. But the Iraqis, for their own purposes and for those of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying a heavy toll as well, the Iraqis do need to make progress on some of the legislation that would lay a foundation for reconciliation. They need to decide how they 're going to divide their oil revenues, for instance. They need constitutional reform. They 're making some progress on those. But let 's remember, George, that this is not easy. This is really hard. @!CONDOLEEZZA-RICE-@# When you 're talking about trying to do this by consensus, not just ramming it down in a majority vote, which they could do, but they 've chosen not to do, it 's very hard. And we 're trying to support them in it. They also need to get more money out to their provinces, and there, we 're helping them to get the, the basis, the actual fiscal basis to do that. And they 're, they 're doing that. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) You know, President Bush talked a lot about al Qaeda in Iraq yesterday. But we 've all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days that - that suggest that al Qaeda is reconstituting itself in Pakistan, in Afghanistan, is n't al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan a greater threat now to the United States than al Qaeda in Iraq? @!CONDOLEEZZA-RICE-@# Look, al Qaeda anywhere is a threat. And we have to recognize that this is an organization that has, has changed since September 11th. Yes, we have killed or captured a lot of the people, probably most of the people, who actually carried out September 11th. But this is an organization that is franchising. It is an organization that has tentacles into a lot of places. And so what they 're doing in Pakistan, we are working with the Pakistani government. That 's why you have military raids in the frontier region in Pakistan. That 's why we are working with the Pakistani government on a hearts and minds strategy to separate the population from the terrorists. @!CONDOLEEZZA-RICE-@# But we have to recognize that it 's an organization that is different. It is an organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it is an organization that we are also working against, tracking, and doing so with many, many tools that we did not have prior to September 11th. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Madam Secretary, we 're just about out of time, but President Bush seemed awful conscious of history yesterday. Are you confident that - that history is gon na say that the President made not just principled decisions, but smart ones? @!CONDOLEEZZA-RICE-@# History will judge. But I know enough to know myself, as an historian, that today 's headlines are rarely the same as history 's judgment. And I think that 's gon na be - the case here as well. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Okay. Madam Secretary, thanks very much for your time this morning. @!CONDOLEEZZA-RICE-@# Thank you. @!GEORGE-STEPHANOPOU# @(Off-camera) Now, let 's go to - straight to Chris with the morning 's news.
