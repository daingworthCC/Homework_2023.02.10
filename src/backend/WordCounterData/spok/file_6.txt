220741 ANNOUNCER : Live from the CNN Center, this is YOUR WORLD TODAY. MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR : A deadly suicide bombing rocks a busy marketplace in northern Israel. Islamic Jihad militants say they did it. ANDREA KOPPEL, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR : And Washington holds its breath. What will a special prosecutor find about whether anyone in the top levels of the Bush administration illegally outed a CIA agent? HOLMES : And the wrath of Wilma. People across Florida and the Caribbean try to pick up their lives. 6:00 p.m. right now in Hadera, on the coast of Israel ; noon in Washington. Hello, everyone. I 'm Michael Holmes @!KOPPEL And I 'm Andrea Koppel. Welcome to ow viewers around the world. This is CNN International, and this is YOUR WORLD TODAY @!HOLMES And we begin with terror in the Israeli coastal town of Hadera. Israeli police say a suicide bomber has killed at least five people and wounded 21 others. Some of them critically. For more, let 's go to John Vause in our Jerusalem bureau with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's being called, John, has frequently been interrupted. JOHN VAUSE, CNN CORRESPONDENT : Yes, very much so, Michael. The latest attack now coming in this open-air marketplace in Hadera. Just over two hours now since a suicide bomber walked into this marketplace in the town of Hadera and detonated the explosives which left five people dead. We now know that at least 21 people have been hurt. According to hospital officials, six people are listed in serious conditions. The others are described as moderately hurt. Earlier, the militant group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for this attack, saying it was revenge for the death of a senior Islamic Jihad leader during an Israeli military raid in the West Bank town of Tulkarem on Monday. That militant leader, Louis Sada( ph), shot to death by the Israeli army during a shoot-out in that raid in Tulkarem. Thousands attended the funeral of Sada( ph). And at the time, Islamic Jihad vowed revenge. That claim of responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago we understand all of the wounded had been taken to the hospital. The area was being cleared. CNN 's Guy Raz joins us now from the scene of the blast. He 's on the phone with us. Guy, what can you see? What is the scene there now in that marketplace as you see it? GUY RAZ, CNN CORRSPONDENT : John, as you mentioned, CNN has been able to confirm that five people have been killed, but just 10 seconds ago another body was taken out of this site. And I 'm not sure if that would increase the death toll in this suicide bombing. But John, as you 've seen in so many of these instances and these events, a scene of absolute chaos and pandemonium. That marketplace that you described is absolutely devastated. Shards of glass and blood stains here right in the center of the town of Hadera. You can also see members of the emergency rescue teams known at ZAKA here collecting all the remains, any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course, under Jewish law, it 's required that all bodies be buried with as many of the remain as can be recovered. Now, as you say, we still believe that five have been killed in this attack. But just a short time ago, another body taken from this site. And it 's unclear whether that would make it six people who have been killed, or if it was one of the five who were originally accounted for. But absolute and utter devastation. As I say, shattered glass, broken glass. Cars with shattered glass, completely destroyed and damaged with hoods opened, completely blown open by the force of this blast which was clearly very strong, indeed -- John @!VAUSE Guy, we 're coming to the end of the Jewish holiday periods, the end of school holidays here in Israel. There were a number of general warnings issued, nothing specific for the area of Hadera. But what type of people would have been in this marketplace at the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here would have been people doing their sort of afternoon shopping. Now, this was a holiday in a sense for some religious Jews, a holiday known as Simchat Torah. Some observed it yesterday. So it was n't really an official holiday in the country in the sense that things were n't shut down. Things were open. Markets were bustling, people were coming to buy things, bread, produce, clothing, for example. Hadera, as you know, John, is a middle class town. It 's a heavily Russian town as well. Many immigrants from Russia live here in this town. Also, a sizable working class population community here. It 's about 20 miles north of Tel Aviv. And I believe -- I believe this is the first time in the history of this community here that there has been such a devastating suicide blast on this scale -- John @!HOLMES Guy, Michael Holmes here at CNN Center. Familiar, tragically familiar scenes of carnage. But as John reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the killing of one of their senior leaders. The cycle, that never-ending cycle of violence, it would appear, continues @!RAZ It would indeed, Michael. Of course, it 's impossible to speculate on what may happen next, whether there may be some kind of retaliatory or counter-retaliatory strike, whether this will continue further on and on. Now, of course it 's been about six weeks since Israel withdrew its last soldiers from the Gaza Strip, formally ending Israel 's 38- year civilian and military presence in that strip of land. But militant groups, particularly in the West Bank, believe that it was militant activity, believe it was attacks like this which throw the Israelis out of Gaza. And there has been some indication for quite some time that militant groups would continue their attacks and, in fact, might even step up their attacks beginning shortly after that Gaza withdrawal ended. It 's possible we are seeing the beginning of that now -- Michael @!HOLMES Yes. Now, as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue in the West Bank. And as we see, militant operations continue, too. In this case, killing innocent people in Hadera. But at the key, at the core of this, Guy, is the -- is the demand by Israel that the Palestinian Authority crack down on those who would carry out operations like this. The reality, it appears, is that, despite their good intentions of some within the PA, they are impotent when it comes to controlling groups like Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Al Aqsa @!RAZ Well, I mean, that 's absolutely the case and the argument that the Palestinian Authority has been making. And there is a lot of evidence to suggest that, in fact, it 's very, very difficult for Palestinian leaders like Mahmoud Abbas to control these groups like Islamic Jihad and Hamas, those two groups in particular. Where it becomes a bit poor complicated for Mahmoud Abbas, is when groups like the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades carry out these kinds of attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brigades is loosely affiliated with Mr. Abbas ' own fatah organization. Now, he may not have command and control over these groups, and it 's very unlikely that he does, in fact, have any say over whether these groups carry out these attacks. So in these kinds of cases what generally happens, and what Mr. Abbas will likely do, is very rapidly disavow these attacks, and perhaps even disavow the groups that carry them out. But we do know that Hamas, for example, which does, of course, have a military wing that does carry out these kinds of operations, will be taking part in the upcoming Palestinian parliamentary elections. And this is something that the Israeli government has opposed, something the Palestinian Authority says is necessary for the continuation of democracy in the Palestinian areas -- Michael @!HOLMES As always, Guy, thanks very much. Guy Raz there, giving us a very full report there on this suicide bombing in Hadera on the Israeli coast @!KOPPEL Continuing with the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action by the Palestinian Authority to prevent attacks by militants. Mark Regeve is the Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman, and he joins us now live from Jerusalem. Mark, obviously, the question that 's going to be on the minds of many after the scene there has been cleaned up and people get to the hospital, is going to be, what is your government 's next move? Can we expect some kind of retaliation? MARK REGEV, ISRAELI FOREIGN MINISTRY : Well, obviously, Andrea, it 's a very difficult day for Israelis. I mean, it 's an especially difficult day for the people of Hadera, who in 2002, 2003, suffered a whole series of suicide bombings and had a period of quiet. And today they were attacked again. I think it just shows once more very clearly that there are groups out there, groups like Hamas, groups like Islamic Jihad, that do n't want to see a process of reconciliation take place between Israelis and Palestinians, do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see is violent jihad. And as your reporter, Guy Raz, said, I think very clearly, Israel 's demand is that the Palestinian Authority take the guns away from these groups. Now, it 's not Israel 's request alone. You know, Andrea, that 's the position of the U.S. government. That 's the position of the Europeans. That 's the position of the U.N. It 's the position of the Russians. I think it 's the position of the entire international community. Mr. Abbas has to take the guns away from these killers @!KOPPEL Let 's talk about that, Mark, because the last time that Secretary of State Rice was in Israel and went to the Palestinian territories I was actually with her. And I spoke to Palestinian officials. This was before the Gaza withdrawal. And we heard clearly from the Palestinian Authority, saying once Israel withdraws, once it withdraws its troops and its citizens from Gaza, there 's going to be a vacuum there that is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces, the Palestinian Authority security forces, do n't have enough guns and cars and all the things you would need to actually patrol properly. Do you buy that? REGEV : I think there are capabilities in the Palestinian Authority. I think the international community can work together to help enhance those capabilities. And Israel will play our part, too. But ultimately, it 's a political decision. I mean, Mr. Abbas has said publicly he wants to see one authority, one gun. He wants to see these different groups disarmed. And he 's made that statement today. He 's condemned this terrible attack in Hadera. But we want to see the follow-through. It 's not just Israel. The whole international community wants to see him follow through and take the guns away from these groups who do these terrible attacks. How can there be a peace process if we see attacks like this? KOPPEL : So how do you propose that -- that President Abbas do that? How can his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al Aqsa, all of these various groups which are clearly more powerful than Palestinian Authority security forces? REGEV : I think the question is how can he not do it? How can he hope to lay the foundations for a future Palestinian state? How can he have elections that really matter? How can he have a Palestinian parliament that can really matter? How can he build a future state for the Palestinian people unless he deals with this rampant lawlessness? You have a situation today in the Palestinian Authority of organized anarchy. He has to act to fulfill his own commitment to his voters. I mean, what do Palestinian elections matter if every different group has a gun and has a policy of its own? You have organized chaos, organized anarchy. Those people who really want to see the best interests of the Palestinians advanced have to support the demand of the international community, that these murderous groups be disarmed @!KOPPEL Mark Regev, joining us from Jerusalem on this extremely difficult day for the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all of the latest headlines, including the bombing in Israel, you can log on to the international edition of the CNN Web site. The address is cnn.com/international @!HOLMES Well, attention is palpable, we 're told, at the White House as a special prosecutor wraps up a two-year criminal probe into the leak of a CIA officer 's identity. Two top aides to the U.S. president and vice president could face criminal charges. We 're going to get some more understanding on this. We have with us there on the left of your screen Bob Franken in Washington. Dana Bash is at the White house. Let 's start with you, Bob. This potentially could be explosive for the Bush administration. BOB FRANKEN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Potentially it could be, if there are indictments levied, handed up against some of the top officials here. That is obviously politically explosive, to say nothing about the questions that it raises for those who would be involved. So here you have the special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today. Unknown whether he is going to come up with any indictments or not. We are told that there will be no announcement today, but that raises possibilities that there would be secret indictments, or no decision has been made, or that the grand jury, which has a deadline of Friday, could be extended, if he gets the judge to give permission. Meanwhile, the top White House aides leave their homes and venture into uncertainty. Karl Rove did that again this morning under the harsh glare of cameras as he got into his car without saying anything meaningful and going to the White House. The same is true to Lewis Scooter Libby, who is the vice president 's chief of staff. Both of their names have come up repeatedly in disclosures about the grand jury and the direction of the special prosecutor. As charges are considered, that would either involve the naming of an undercover CIA operative -- that 's the underlying law. Remember, this is an investigation almost two years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CIA operative. She 's the husband -- she 's the wife, rather, of a critic of the administration. So there would be a determination that this was done intentionally. Other charges, however, that the special prosecutor 's been known to explore include the so-called cover-up allegations. It could include perjury, obstruction of justice, that type of thing, and the standby conspiracy. Lastly, there has been some discussion about the possible role of Vice President Cheney, discussion meaning that we know that the special prosecutor has on occasion asked questions about that. But right now, as you said, the tension is palpable at the White House. Outside the courthouse I think it 's fair to say that the impatience is palpable @!HOLMES From the courthouse, Bob Franken. Let 's go to the White House, where Dana Bash is standing by. Dana, we talked a little earlier about the potential damage to the White House of this, the remainder of the administration 's term. George Bush, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciously staying focused on other issues and just referring to background chatter and the like. But how worried are people in the corridors there? DANA BASH, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT : Very. Very worried. Certainly you just described it here, the scene. And that is, the MO is to sort of go on with business as usual. But I can tell you that the news this morning that there will likely not be any public news from Fitzgerald, any announcements whether there will be indictments or not, that actually is not necessarily a good thing for the mood here at the White House. They 're just about ready to let the air out of the balloon here. I talked to one aide here just a short while ago who said, " Whatever happens, I wish it would just happen. " Look, they have their TVs on. They see that the special prosecutor is going in to meet with the grand jury. They hear our reports that there have been late interviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking questions about Karl Rove 's role in this whole inquiry, in this whole leaks issue. So that is sort of what 's going on behind the scenes. In public, you 're right. We saw our president just a short while ago walk across the driveway, wave as he went to go on with a meeting with the congressional leaders. He had a bill-signing. He 'll have several other meetings and a speech later on today. In a short while, we 're going to hear from the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, who 's here in the briefing room. So that 's what they 're trying to do in public. But I can tell you, Michael, behind the scenes, very quietly, they are planning for the " what ifs. " What if something actually happens? What if a top official is indicted if there are announcements? They 're planning for a presidential speech shortly after that happens @!HOLMES Interesting times, as the Chinese would day. Bob Franken and Dana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poll shows Americans are divided over whether the White House did anything illegal or even unethical in the CIA leak case. In a CNN " USA-Today " -Gallup poll, 39 percent of respondents said some Bush administration officials acted illegally. But the same percentage said they acted unethically but did n't act illegal. Ten percent of them say they did nothing wrong at all. Meanwhile, President Bush 's job approval rating has rebounded a little bit after hitting an all-time low just last week. In the latest poll, 42 percent of respondents said they approve of the way Mr. Bush is handling his job. We 're going to have much more on those -- on those numbers later in the program @!HOLMES All right. Want to go now to the White House, I believe, where the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, is speaking to reporters. Let 's listen in. ZALMAY KHALILZAD, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO IRAQ :... of the Iraqi people turning out to vote, and 78 percent of the voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a landmark moment for Iraq. It places Iraq in the vanguard of nations in the broader Middle East, moving toward a system of government that is based on the will of the people and that will respect the rights of all individuals. Success in Iraq, both for Iraqis and for Americans, depends on whether the Iraqi leaders can agree on a national compact, a vision for the new Iraq that has the support of Iraq 's communities. The ratification of the constitution signals major progress toward that goal. In negotiating the constitution, Iraqis on all sides of all major issues worked toward compromise. Sometimes the talks were difficult and some of the compromises did not come easily. We can take heart that the process of overcoming differences through negotiations, not conflict, has begun to take root @!KHALILZAD Also, for those who voted against the document, an avenue exists for further changes that can be made by the next assembly. Like the U.S. Constitution, this is a living document that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Iraqi people. There were no winners or losers among the Iraqi people. By casting his or her vote, every Iraqi was winning a victory for democracy in Iraq. The only losers in this referendum were the terrorists and the Saddamists who want to destroy the democratic aspirations of the people of Iraq. Though more remains to be done to overcome the divisions in Iraqi society, the process of forging and implementing a national compact is under way. I will continue to work with the Iraqi leaders to facilitate this process as they move toward national elections in December and the formation of a new government. It 's important to avoid becoming jaded about events as historic as this constitution. This is a breakthrough for this region. Never before has a major country in the Arab world freely elected representatives to draft a constitution that would then be submitted to the people for ratification in an open, free and fair process. Iraqis have vindicated the fact that the ideas of rule by the people and the sanctity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basis for politics and government in the Middle East, just as they have been in successful countries in the Americas, in Europe and parts of Asia. Americans should be proud of the role that we as a nation are playing in Iraq. We are supporting the needed political and economic transformation of the broader Middle East, because authoritarianism and repression breeds the kind of terrorists who struck us on September the 11th @!KHALILZAD Yet we are fighting not just with armed forces, but also with the power of ideas, of freedom and democracy. It is in favor of these ideas and the hopes and the possibilities that spring from them that the Iraqi people have so resoundingly voted. Thank you very much. I 'll be glad to take your questions @!QUESTION You spoke about that more needs to be done to erase the divisions in the Iraqi society. What do you think is the biggest hurdle there? KHALILZAD : Of course, there are several issues on which the Iraqis are divided at the present time. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see federalism as a way to keep the country together ; others see it as a pathway toward fragmentation. They have reached a compromise because there has been an acceptance in the constitution of the principle of federalism, but at the present time it 's limited only to the Kurdish area. But the next assembly will decide whether and how many additional federal units will be formed. There 's also a difference of view with regard to the role of Islam. And they have reached a compromise on that which respects the role of Islam but at the same time emphasizes that principles of democracy as well as the human rights... HOLMES : All right. The U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, speaking there to reporters at the White House, giving something of a progress report on developments in Iraq. We 're going to take a short break. We will be back, however, with much more.( COMMERCIAL BREAK) HOLMES : Welcome back to YOUR WORLD TODAY on CNN International, an hour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States now, where Hurricane Wilma may have taken just a few hours to cross the state of Florida ; however, she did leave behind a trail of devastation. And many victims still frustrated by the lack of aid coming their way. Allan Chernoff joins us now live from Oakland Park, Florida. Allan, still a little bit of a mess? ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNN SR @!CORRESPONDENT Well, certainly a mess around Florida. But at least I can report to you that FEMA right here in Oakland Park is delivering. You can see behind me people receiving ice right now. They 're also receiving jugs of water. And this exactly the way that FEMA is supposed to operate. All of these trucks were contracted by FEMA. This truck over here originated in Maine. Last -- last week, it drove down to Jacksonville, Florida, then on to West Palm Beach. And from West Palm, it drove over here this morning. Eight trucks in the entire convoy. And people, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everybody waiting to receive their ration of water and ice. Keep in mind, the people here have been without power since the storm. Also without potable water. So, certainly, very happy people now receiving their rations. But I can tell you, after the experience yesterday, when people came here and had to wait for hours and hours, some of those people did n't even get any rations. Well, they certainly still have frustration after that experience yesterday.( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : We went around looking for ice yesterday, and the places that were supposed to have ice did not have any ice because the trucks did n't come. So we rode around burning out the little bit of gas that we did have trying to get ice, and there was no ice to be given, or water.( END VIDEO CLIP) CHERNOFF : The line here extends all the way around this roller rink at the public park here. So there are clearly at least 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can see, the line is moving pretty well. I ca n't say the same for some of the lines at the gas stations here in southern Florida. Not all that many gas stations opened, but at stations that are opened, they are barely moving. That 's at least what we saw this morning. I saw two gas stations. One had a line of about 80 cars. The other, a line of about 90 cars. And people were just sitting there, not moving at all during the 20 minutes I spent shooting video and also interviewing people just waiting for their gasoline. So gas still a real problem here in Florida -- Michael @!HOLMES Wow. Impressive pictures there, Allan. Amazing, those cues at the gas station. Thanks so much. Allan Chernoff there @!KOPPEL Finally a little bit of good news to report on that front @!HOLMES Yes, did you see those huge lines at the gas station? KOPPEL : So many people. It 's incredible. The top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leak controversy @!HOLMES And then a little later, talking tough on Syria. What the U.S., Britain and France are seeking after a damaging report on that country.( COMMERCIAL BREAK) HOLMES : A warm welcome back to YOUR WORLD TODAY, right here on CNN International. I 'm Michael Holmes @!KOPPEL And I 'm Andrea Koppel. Here are some of the top stories we 're following for you @!HOLMES Israeli police say it was a suicide bomber who attack a crowded marketplace in the coastal city of Hadera. Officials say at least five Israelis were killed, 21 others were wounded. Islamic Jihad in Gaza has claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it it in retaliation for Israeli force skilling one of its leaders in recent days. Israel had been on high alert since that incident early this week @!KOPPEL It is a race against the clock for survivors of the South Asia earthquake. Meeting in Geneva, the United Nations officials are appealing for nearly $550 million for the relief effort. As many as three million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be a second disaster if those survivors do n't get help in the next five to six weeks. That 's before winter sets in @!HOLMES A special prosecutor is wrapping up a two-year probe over who leaked the identity of an undercover CIA operative. Two top aides to the president and vice president could face criminal charges. The White House is n't commenting, at least not yet, on reports linking Vice President Dick Cheney to the drama. The operative 's husband was a critic of the Bush administration 's Iraq policy @!KOPPEL The possibility of indictments in the CIA leak case adds to the list of political problems for the White House. The death toll in the Iraq war has hit the 2,000 mark. The Harriet Miers nomination to the Supreme Court is under fire. White House correspondent Suzanne Malveaux has more for you.( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SUZANNE MALVEAUX, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT( voice-over) : Insiders are calling this the darkest days for the White House as the president and his aides brace themselves for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insider says Mr. Bush is ready for the outcome. His feeling being, whatever it is, let 's get on with it. Senior aides say getting on with it is part of their immediate damage control strategy. GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : The American people expect me to do my job, and I 'm going to @!MALVEAUX Should the president 's top political adviser, Karl Rove, or the vice president 's chief of staff, Scooter Libby, be indicted, insiders say it is widely assumed they will resign immediately, and trusted aides will move in to fill the void. The president will make a brief statement citing the legal process that is ongoing, and the White House and its friends will make a dramatic pivot to change the subject and move forward. DAVID GERGEN, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER : The administration has to reassure the country that the president can still govern, that he 's still running things @!MALVEAUX The U.S. mission in Iraq being a primary focus on this day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not rest or tire until the war on terror is won @!MALVEAUX Wednesday, Mr. Bush will turn his attention to the economy, in a speech calling for fiscal discipline. Thursday, he 'll travel to Florida to comfort victims of Hurricane Wilma. And Friday, on to Southern Virginia, to give a pep talk on the war on terror. While one White House insider says losing Karl Rove would be a devastating blow to the president, Mr. Bush thinks that his own ability and authority derives from his policies ; that Rove is an extension of the president, not a puppet master, that the administration can move forward on its long-term agenda, including tax reform and immigration @!GERGEN They can and should move to get modest pieces of legislation through before the end of this year, but their legislative window will reopen in January with the State of the Union, and that 's the time, if they 've got some big initiatives to push, to come forward with them. MALVEAUX( on camera) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aside from whatever happens in the CIA leak investigation, the president must try to win back the support of his conservative base, fractured over the Harriet Miers ' nomination. Suzanne Malveaux, CNN, the White House.( END VIDEOTAPE) HOLMES : Well, there are indications, more indications, of troubled times for the Bush administration. New polls are showing the public 's view of the administration 's ethics has dipped. Let 's talk about that now with Frank Newport, editor-in-chief of Gallup Polls. He joins us now with the numbers. Hi, Frank. FRANK NEWPORT, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, GALLUP : Hello, Michael. Indeed, we 're in a holding pattern of sorts, of course, waiting to see what happens today, tomorrow, Friday, whenever, this week, if those indictments come down. Bush 's job approval rating hovering right around the 40 percent mark. It was 39, now it 's 42 in our weekend poll. Critical, of course -- over half of Americans, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his job. That 's not good for any president, of course. What about the CIA leak itself? This is what I could call baseline data. Based on what they know -- we already have 39 percent of Americans who say tha tWhite House officials did something illegal. Another 39 percent say it 's unethical, but not illegal. Only 10 percent, nothing wrong. These numbers we will monitor carefully if and when indictments come down. What about the ethical statements in general? Well, it 's split. I like to look at it this way. Those left two columns, Michael, excellent or good. Those are ratings of the ethical standards of the White House, a total up to about 50 percent. Add the right two columns up, the more negative columns, not good or poor, also about 50 percent. So right now the public 's split on the ethical standards of the White House. Depending on how you look at it, probably not good news that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!HOLMES Frank, before I let you go, a lot, of course, is being made of what some call a milestone, the announcement of the 2,000th U.S. soldier killed in Iraq. Is the American public opinion still turning against the war and, if so, by how much? NEWPORT : Well, it 's not a linear pattern, Michael. And I think this is important. That is, as time goes on, Americans do n't just steadfastly get more and more negative. It kind of moves up and down. And, actually, in our last poll, which was conducted Friday through Sunday, after the constitutional vote, but before the publicity this week about the 2,000th American being killed over there, we had actually seen a little drop in the number of Americans who said that the war was a mistake in Iraq. You can see the trend here. It had jumped up to 59 percent in September. Now it 's split about equal. Half say a mistake, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative as it has been on that front. However, when asked how 's the war going over there in Iraq for America? No change there. The majority of Americans say things are not going well for the U.S. in Iraq at this point -- Michael @!HOLMES All right, Frank, as always, thanks. Frank Gallup -- Frank Newport, rather, at Gallup. Thanks a lot. Well, we mentioned that 2,000 mark. Symbolic die-ins will be held outside the White House, starting this evening. These vigils being held right through Saturday to mark the 2,000th U.S. military deaths in the Iraq war. Cindy Sheehan is among the activists at this week 's event. You may remember, she led an anti-war protest outside President Bush 's ranch this summer @!KOPPEL Well, from Iraq to Syria, the U.S., France and Britain are pressing the rest of the U.N. Security Council to adopt a tough new resolution against Syria if Damascus does not cooperate fully with the investigation into Rafik Hariri. That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February. The U.S. ambassador to the U.N. is taking the lead in this effort. Senior U.N. correspondent Richard Roth joins us live with more. So, Richard, yesterday we were talking about how the U.S. and its allies really want to get unanmity among the 15 members of the Security Council, but to do so, they 've got to win over China, Russia and Algeria. You ca n't have helped, now that the Arab League is not saying positive things about potential sanctions against Syria. What are you hearing? RICHARD ROTH, CNN SR. U.N @!CORRESPONDENT Well, cuuntries are staking out their positions publicly, at least. And as we 've seen with Iraq and other crises, some things can change behind closed doors. Right now, the U.S., Britain and France are united in going after Syria, a country that -- clearly on collision course diplomatically, following the report by Detliff Metliff, a report which had damaging conclusions about Syria and Lebanese involvement in the assassination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting any cooperation from the Syrian government. Thus the pressure with this new resolution, which would cause Syria to have to detain suspects, or else face some extreme measures, including sanctions.( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN BOLTON, U.S. AMB. TO U.N. : Well, I think if there 's no Syrian cooperation, that it 's entirely appropriate to look at further measures. I think that 's part of sending a strong signal to Syria, that by December 15th, if not before, we want full and active cooperation @!QUESTION Does that include the president of Syria? BOLTON : It absolutely includes of president of Syria. No person is above the law, and the president 's had time to talk to the media, to all of you ladies and gentlemen. If he has had time to do that, he has time to talk with Commissioner Metliff. Shortly after that, Bolton, the U.S. ambassador, seen meeting with the Russian ambassador, beginning the lobbying campaign.( END VIDEO CLIP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, his country opposes sanctions. Algeria, the lone Arab country, Andrea, on the council, also saying they would be opposed right now to sanctions. They think the prosecutor should be given more time to complete his report, and then consider what to do. So not necessarily sounding good on that front, if they want to get 15 votes, but you mentioned the president -- President Assad of Syria. There was a letter, apparently, that he wrote to the council members. What do we know about that? And do you think that it would persuade any of the members to vote against it? ROTH : Well, first off, the U.S. delegation claims they never got the letter, and many council members are not talking about it or seeing it. Letters may have gone elsewhere, but this is a letter which Syria says, as they said at the Security Council yesterday, that they are cooperating with the Metliff investigation, and that they would detain, arrest, prosecute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Metliff told the Security Council when asked about the Hariri file, that the Syrian government had, or information on others, they said they had no such file. John Bolton told me the Security Council laughed when Metliff told them that story. Missing letters. Richard Roth at the United Nations, thanks very much. RICHARD ROTH, CNN CORRESPONDENT : All right. Do n't go away. Still to come on YOUR WORLD TODAY. Kashmir 's upcoming Snows have set a grim deadline. There is a line of life or death for tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of fellow human beings. An urgent appeal on behalf of millions facing an uncertain future.( COMMERCIAL BREAK) BLITZER : And welcome back. This is YOUR WORLD TODAY on CNN International. Thanks for your company. The United Nations has nearly doubled its appeal for aid relief for the victims of South Asia 's earthquake. Now Paula Hancocks has more on the pitfalls of pledging humanitarian aid.( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villages in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir are receiving vital medical aid and shelter for the first time since the earthquake hit. Relief is only able to reach the Kaladaku( ph) Valley by boat. SAEED MALIK MABRA, EARTHQUAKE SURVIVOR( through translator) : This is the first time we 've received anything @!HANCOCKS 2.5 weeks after the quake, relief organizations say many more victims are yet to be reached, with the harsh Himalayan winter swiftly approaching. DR. MALEEHA LODHI, PAKISTANI AMB. TO U.K. : The twin dangers out there are exposure to the cold and infections, so we need to move very quickly. Speed is of the essence, and generosity to enable that speed is also key @!HANCOCKS The United Nations initially called on countries to donate $312 million in relief aid. But so far has raised less than one-third of that. Now the U.N. says even more money is needed, and is asking for $550 million. JAN EGELAND, U.N. EMERGENCY RELIEF COORDINATOR : It is really a deadline, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning, because there is a line of life or death for tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of fellow human beings before the snow falls on the Himalayas @!HANCOCKS The U.N. appealed for funds after last December 's tsunami was more than 80 percent met within 10 days of the disaster. But international aid groups say governments are failing to follow-up on financial pledges quickly enough. SARAH KLINE, OXFAM : Very sadly, actually, this is the norm. It 's normal that only 30 percent of these kind of U.N. appeals are actually filled. The tsunami and the response to the Bam earthquake was very unusual @!HANCOCKS Relief organizations warned the death toll from the earthquake currently at 79,000 could double unless rich countries donate more money immediately. BETTINA LUESCHER, WORLD FOOD PROGRAM : People will die. They will die in the next few weeks, if there 's no more money coming in or helicopters coming in. You need the money to buy the food and get the food into those locations @!HANCOCKS As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helicopters ferry back the injured granted Wednesday due to bad weather. Paula Hancocks, CNN, London.( END VIDEOTAPE) KOPPEL : The chairwoman of Pakistan 's Human Rights Commission joined us just last hour, and gave us this account of a recent visit to Pakistani-controlled Kashmir.( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ASMA JAHANGIR, PAKISTANI RIGHTS HUMAN COMM. : People have not even grieved the dead ones, and they are now looking towards more resources and shelter so that they can save the lives of those that are alive. And I think that it is the only decent thing for the world community to do. After all, resources of the world have to take priority about saving lives of people, and many of these people have been already so disadvantaged, and now so vulnerable.( END VIDEO CLIP) KOPPEL : Jahangir says that survivors need not only relief supply, but they also need trauma therapy to address the survivors ' grief @!HOLMES U.S. Homeland Security Michael Chertoff will travel to tour the damage of Hurricane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will do much the same on Thursday. One of the biggest frustrations for many people has been what you 're looking at there, long lines for basic items such as ice, water, food and gasoline. FEMA 's acting director David Paulison says hundreds of trucks are on the way with supplies. Meanwhile, about six million are without electricity, and it could take weeks before all the power to be restored. Meanwhile, the northeastern United States still feeling the effects of that powerful storm, which is fueled by Wilma. The coastline lashed by gusts nearing hurricane strength and also heavy rain. All right. A lot of people like classical music, of course @!KOPPEL Yes, they do. This is a very unusual story. It has something to do with being latched to the vine? HOLMES : Something like that, an unusual audience @!KOPPEL That 's right. And we are going to... HOLMES : Have that light. But first, we 're just teasing you. We 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Well, if you love classical musics and you enjoy fine wine, perhaps this story is for you @!KOPPEL Why, yes! I do enjoy fine music and fine wine @!HOLMES I know you enjoy fine wine @!KOPPE But it also appears that grapes -- yes, grapes -- enjoy classical music, too, at least at one vineyard. Here 's a report to savor from our Alessio Vinci.( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALESSIO VINCI, CNN CORRESPONDENT( voice-over) : If good wine is all about sunshine and soil, can a good tune be just as beneficial? Carlo Cignozzi believes yes. Music, he says, helps grapes grow stronger and healthier. So instead of using chemicals to keep parasites, molds and bacteria away -- Cignozzi set up a network of speakers he says delights his vineyards 24 hours a day with the likes of Beethoven, Mahler and Vivaldi. The grapes closest to the speakers he says, ripen faster. CARLOS CIGNOZZI, WINEMAKER : You can see here. So the first row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red. And if you go on, if you go on -- far away. VINCI( on camera) : Go further away from the speaker? CIGNOZZI : Very far away from the speaker, the bunches are green. VINCI( voice-over) : Carlos says people in town believe he is, in his words, a little crazy, or perhaps just jealous of his success. All of his production, about 35,000 bottles a year, are quickly sold, a third of it to the U.S.( on camera) : Skeptics may balk, but the benefits of music on these vineyards are being studied at a university in Florence not too far away from here. Researchers there say it is too early to draw any conclusions, but they do say that early tests show that these vineyards are growing stronger because of the sound.( voice-over) : And what the grapes listen to, the owner says, is just as crucial.( on camera) : What about other music? Not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock and samba. Because if the people in the wine room, you shot the rock in samba, for day and night, be kind of crazy, mad, because I prefer classical @!VINCI You do n't want the wine to go crazy? CIGNOZZI : No, no. VINCI( voice-over) : Alessio Vinci, CNN, Montalcino, Italy.( END VIDEOTAPE) KOPPEL : I want to know how they know if the grapes really like it? Because I heard that all they do is whine about it @!HOLMES Oh, that 's awful. All right, got to go. See you later. Bye.( COMMERCIAL BREAK)
