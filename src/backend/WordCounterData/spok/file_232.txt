4172641 @!JAMES-ROSEN, -FOX-NCHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT : Tucker, good to be with you. Many Trump supporters, conservatives and legal experts tonight are questioning the timing and particularly the scope of this investigation into the conduct of FBI Director James Comey. That will be carried out by the Justice Department 's Inspector General. Chief among these skeptics is the President-elect himself who tweeted before dawn and I quote, " What are Hillary Clinton 's people complaining about with respect to the FBI? Based on the information they had, she should never been allowed to run. Guilty as hell, " Mr. Trump said, " They were very nice to her. She lost because she campaigned in the wrong states, no enthusiasm. " Investigators will prove Comey 's public statements about the Hillary Clinton email investigation. The tons of leaks out of the bureau this past fall and the letters that Comey sent to Congress just days before the election re-opening. And then closing the case again. Observers from disparate points along the political spectrum today urged Comey to resign. @( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of such an important institution when that trust is no longer there. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE# the fate of the people of the FBI are somewhat shaken in their leadership. And the fate of the country and the director of the FBI is somewhat peerless. Given all of that, he ought to spend more time with his family. @( END VIDEO CLIP) @!ROSEN# The IG probe will notably not include the conduct of Attorney General Loretta Lynch who was forced defectively to recuse herself from the Clinton email case when it was disclosed that the Attorney General had met privately with former President Bill Clinton. Many Republicans see the IG probe as simply an attempt to delegitimize Mr. Trump before he takes office. @( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) @!ELLIOT-BERKE, -PRES# If the scope is n't limited to the director of the FBI 's conduct, then they have a point. I mean, why not look at the entire circumstances here? Why not look at what Attorney General Lynch did, the meetings that she held, her non-recusal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( END VIDEO CLIP) @!ROSEN# So, in short, Tucker, you ask me what is this all about. Experts I 've spoken to said, yes, Director Comey 's conduct throughout this case, a very key decisions he made a various points are precisely the kind of things especially in a such a high-profile case that the Inspector General would investigate. But it is the circumscribing of this case, the sort of narrowing just to Comey that bothers conservatives. @!CARLSON# Right. Where is Loretta Lynch 's component -- @!ROSEN# Among other things. Yes. @!CARLSON# Among other things. James, thanks a lot. @!ROSEN# You bet. I appreciate it. @!CARLSON# Well, Hillary Clinton 's defeat in November might have prompted some soul-searching in the American press. Instead, the blame has been placed on among other things, an alleged plague of fake news. And now with one week until the inauguration, lawmakers are trying to use the scourge of fake news to influence your kids in school. California Assemblyman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require schools to teach civic online reasoning in California. The goal to tell students what news is fake, what is real, and shape their beliefs accordingly. Assemblyman Gomez joins us now. Assemblyman, thanks for coming on. @!JIMMY-GOMEZ, -CALIF# Thank you, Tucker. @!CARLSON# So, you have written this piece of legislation that commands, if passed, will command the schools to do this. To teach, quote, " The ability to judge the credibility and quality of the information found on internet web sites including social media. " How exactly will they do that? To tell fake from real? @!GOMEZ# So, Tucker, my bill, AB 155, the fake news act of 2017 directs the instructional quality commission to develop a curriculum with experts in education on civic online curriculum, civic online reasoning and how to include that in two different courses. Civics, history, mathematics and science. And it will basically allow them to discern how do you break apart information in the digital age that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. So, they can break it apart and decide for themselves what is credible and what is not. @!CARLSON# Okay. But how will they do that? I mean, how do you tell a story that is fake from one that is real and what does it mean to be fake? @!GOMEZ# Well, one of the thing that I grew up learning is how do you use footnotes and citations in order to verify the facts that I was reading. One of the things that we know is that online sources, we ca n't really do that. It is very difficult. So, one of the things it would do is given the skills on how to research who owns a particular domain name. You know, is it the real FOX News twitter handle with the checkmark, or it is n't? Because a lot of people are having a tough time telling, is this really FOX News? Or is this some other site? Often times, people believe the false site or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. So, this is n't about telling them what to believe, it 's just giving them the skills so that they can actually distinguish for themselves what is real and what is fake. @!CARLSON# But I do n't understand what that means to be false. I mean, does that mean that the content on the site is false if you do n't like the domain name? I mean, what is false mean? @!GOMEZ# No. It means that, you know, one of the things, it 's not about -- false mean sometimes there are some websites that give you a little bit of real information, a little bit of fake information, and they kind of blur it all together. I know FOX News would never do that. You guys try to give them the real facts just like every other news station according to their mission. Right? So, we are not here to basically say that this is automatically fake news. But we want people to look at every piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been doing for a long time. With a critical eye. And start asking more questions. Is this something that I should believe, is it a reputable source? Do the facts back up the claims? @!CARLSON# I mean, a lot of questions come to mind. First among them, why ca n't they do that themselves? Why they 're assuming they do n't already do that? Who are you to make that decision? But you keep dodging the core question which is, how do you know what is fake and what is real? I mean, that is the center of this. It is the fake news bill. What is fake news? And I 'm still -- I 'm not getting it from what you just said. @!GOMEZ# Well, there -- @!CARLSON# I mean, for example, BuzzFeed, which is a big website, billion dollar website just released a 35 page dossier reportedly on Donald Trump. Reportedly from Russia. Is that fake or real in your judgment? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is look at every story with a critical eye. And then I try to do more research on it. I do n't automatically believe everything that I read. @!CARLSON# Okay. @!GOMEZ# But I do want to make sure that we kind of break it apart. I want our students to be prepared. You know, this is a digital age where we get more of our information through online and social media resources than we do from books and newspapers. In the past, we did n't even have to question books and newspapers but for some reason, we 're in an age where people think just because they read it online, they believe it is real. And that is a big problem because if we can agree -- @!CARLSON# Can I stop you there? How do you know that people believe -- I mean, you seem to have a pretty low opinion of the intelligence of your constituents. Why do you think that the people who vote for you, your voters in California believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? That they are that dumb? @!GOMEZ# Carlson, you are putting words in my mouth. @!CARLSON# You just said, people believe what they read and they shouldn't. @!GOMEZ# What we are trying to do is prepare -- what we are trying to do is prepare our youth for a digital age. You know, there is nothing wrong with it. Like when technology was changing and people started using computers, we wanted them to learn how to use a computer so that they can be competitive, so they can actually be able to go and get a job, and be able to adapt to the changing environment. It 's the same thing. We are trying to make sure that our kids have the skills necessary to distinguish what information from different sources -- to take it, to analyze it, and then decide for themselves. For themselves, what is the real story and what is a fake story. @!CARLSON# Here is the problem. Valued, judgment come into place, subjective judgments play a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. What is true and what is false. And I keep asking you to explain the criteria for making that determination. And you are not. Either because you do n't know what it is yourself, I asked you, do you believe for example the dossier that BuzzFeed and CNN ran with two days ago was real and fake. And you would n't answer. So, I see a problem here. @!GOMEZ# Because I have n't -- first, I have n't read it. Number one. Number two, I am not going to make a claim on something I have n't read and I have n't had a chance to actually verify. @!CARLSON# Okay. That 's fair. That 's totally fine. But you still -- no and I would n't ask you to. But you still have n't answered the key question which is, what is it mean to be fake news? @!GOMEZ# Well, it 's interesting -- @!CARLSON# And I am worried because that you have a power, you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be disregarded. Why would that make me nervous? @!GOMEZ# No, I 'm not saying that some news should be disregarded because they provide a particular point of view. That is what you 're implying. I 'm not implying that. What I 'm telling you is that people do need to know, is this story that they are reading on Facebook or Twitter? Is this actually like the headline -- if they read the headline -- is this a headline they actually used from a particular story five months ago that they are just using because it 's catchy and it actually gets people 's attention? @!CARLSON# Right. @!GOMEZ# Is it actually the fact that -- they saying that Tucker Carlson went to school in Alabama, which I do n't know if you did, is that real? So, is that something they should actually be able to verify? @!CARLSON# Okay. my point -- that people under 18 are probably a little more sophisticated about digital media than either you or I. Here 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles, which you represent, almost none of the kids know how to do math. Twenty nine percent of the students in Los Angeles unified school district met the math standards last year, among Black students, it was 18 percent. So, why would you be spending any time on fake news which you can even defined when only 18 percent of your African-American students can do math up to us standards. Should you be more worried about that or no? @!GOMEZ# Tucker, what we tried to do is make sure that we provide the curriculum that the school districts want to implore. So, we are not mandating that under my bill, AB 155 that they have to incorporate the civil online reasoning. It basically said that they 're going to develop a curriculum with the experts with public input, regarding civil online reasoning and then the school districts have a choice that they want to include it or not. We are not mandating it. We are actually giving them an option and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced any bills to improve the math scores in your district? Eighteen percent of black kids meet the standards. How many piece legislation have you introduced to improve that number? @!GOMEZ# Hey, Tucker, that 's -- I 've done different things to make sure that we invest more dollars into the classrooms and disadvantaged students so that the money stays there, so that they do improve their test scores. @!CARLSON# Yes. But they 're not. @!GOMEZ# And we have seen them improved their test scores at the time. So, these are two different things. And I believe that you can actually accomplish both at the same time. @!CARLSON# Well, you ca n't accomplish it. I just read the test scores from the LA, you know, from their school district and they are going down unfortunately. And that 's sad. Thanks a lot Assemblyman, we appreciate you. @!GOMEZ# Thank you. @!CARLSON# Well, Donald Trump 's eminent inauguration continues to drive his opponents off the edge. Now Georgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's presidency as legitimate. When asked today whether he would try to develop a relationship with the new President for the good of the country, Lewis said this. @( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) @!REP-JOHN-LEWIS-(D)# I believe in forgiveness, I believe in tremendous work that people do. It 's going to be hard. It will be difficult. I do n't see this President-elect as a legitimate president. the Russians participated in helping this man get elected. And they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton. @( END VIDEO CLIP) @!CARLSON# Well, because of Trump 's supposed illegitimacy, Lewis says, he plans to join five other Democrats in boycotting the inauguration next week. Well, Donald Trump 's plan to drain the swamp in Washington includes banning all former members of Congress for lobbying for five years once they leave. But the Speaker of the House Paul Ryan is not onboard during a town hall over at CNN on Thursday. Ryan describes Trump 's proposal as, quote, " dangerous. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real threat is the personal wealth of lawmakers? Joining us now, the co-host of " THE FIVE, " and one of our favorite people, Kimberly Guilfoyle. Kimberly, it 's great to see you. @!**25;681;TOOLONG, " THE FIVE " : Hi, Tucker. Great to see you. @!CARLSON# So, I do n't want to pile on the Speaker of the House, who might take us on the right track on most things. @!GUILFOYLE# Certainly. @!CARLSON# But Donald Trump was elected in part to clean up Washington. Which is self-evidently corrupt. Voters believed that. I lived here. I can tell you they 're right. And so, it 's a little strange that a pretty common sense provision like banning members of Congress from cashing in at the expense of taxpayers would be described by the Speaker as, quote, " dangerous. " What do you think he meant by that? @!GUILFOYLE# Yes. it is a little bit disconcerting, is n't it? Because, you know, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that you admire. that he has the best interest of the country at heart. But when you see President-elect Donald Trump talking about and as part of the drain the swamp movement, he knows what he 's talking about. Because he wants to make sure that there is an ethical, clear line. That you do n't have people joining in terms of their public service and civic service in order to profit on the other end. @!CARLSON# That is right. @!GUILFOYLE# You want people to be genuine in spirit and heart. And they want to be all in because they want to act in the best interest with the utmost ethics and propriety in terms of the country. So people are doing this only to be able to cash in on deals and get a bigger better deal on the other end, there is a problem on that the goal post is n't there. So, you have to give pause for a moment with all due respect, when the Speaker says this. Because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying let 's make it purer, let 's make it clean so that we get the best and brightest, of the purest of heart to try and invest in the fabric and the skin of this country so that we are all the beneficiaries. It is a public service and it is deemed as such for a reason. @!CARLSON# Well, of course. So, just to be fair, I want to read the speaker 's words. So our viewers can assess them. He said this about the lobbying -- but if he wanted to become an advocate for the cancer society? What if he want after he retired to help your local hospital system and be on their board to support them? And then go and get legislation. We tried to get Speaker Ryan to respond directly and he was busy feeding war orphans and trying to kill lupus, so he was n't here of course to respond. @!GUILFOYLE# Nice test. @!CARLSON# But that 's with respect. That 's ludicrous. I live among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not there to help the cancer society, they are there to get rich. Which is their right of course. But let 's not pretend that this lobbying band would put a lot of these guys out of the Mother Teresa business. Because it wouldn't. @!GUILFOYLE# No. Let 's be honest. It may be a little bit of like a delay in the game, like sort of like a little bit of a temporary rainout but it would n't preclude them from being able to benefit in the future. And of course, in a free and Democratic society. That is what we want. We want people to be invested in this country, to dedicate themselves, to give a public service and then yes. We want them to be able to provide for their families on the other end. But with due measure and to be circumspect in terms of how they proceed on that path. And that is the intent of what the President-elect is just saying and also as a realist, that Speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacon on the plate, Tucker. @!CARLSON# Well, yes, but the effect comes at our expense. I mean, that 's why all of those mandates are on ObamaCare. That 's why everyone but me and you is enjoying some sort of esoteric tax break that allows them to buy a new plane. I mean, lobbyists are doing that. I 'm sorry, it 's true. Kimberly -- @!GUILFOYLE# No. But you 're right. Yes, yes, yes, there is lack of purity in the process. We shall cleanse. @(LAUGHTER) @!CARLSON# We shall cleanse. I hope they do. Thanks a lot, Kimberly. Great to see you. @!GUILFOYLE# Always a pleasure. @!CARLSON# Up next, a fear over an alleged Russian hacking framed the Kremlin as the enemy of America. Russia expert Steven Cohen joins us to explain what the two countries could gain through renewed engagement. Something he says. Also, driverless cars coming to the state of Arizona. Sounds great. And it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that state. What is going to happen to those who drive for a living? What are they going to do when their jobs disappear? @!CARLSON# Most Americans drive every day. And some of them drive for a living. A lot of them, actually. From cabbies, tracks, to bus drivers, and literally millions of Americans earn a living behind the wheel. But the driverless car will kill these jobs. Recently, Uber driverless cars in the streets of Arizona at the invitation of Governor Doug Ducey. Do you think about the consequences to American jobs? We asked him that question. @( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) @!CARLSON# Thanks for joining us, Governor. I appreciate it. I understand what you are trying to do with this driverless technology. California has too much regulation. Arizona has less. And so business naturally goes to Arizona and you also think it 's an interesting transform of technology. I agree with all that. But my question is, what is going to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are an awful lot of them. @!GOV-DOUG-DUCEY-(R)# Well, Tucker, we 're glad that companies that are innovative and breakthrough in technology are looking to Arizona versus California because we are more business friendly. @!CARLSON# Yes. @!DUCEY# We have less regulation, a better tax environment and we have concern as well for jobs and what is going to happen inside of our economy. But the sounds a little bit like what happened when uber came the first time. Everyone said that this would hurt jobs, that it would hurt taxi drivers. And what we 've seen is more jobs added to the economy. So, this is a test right now, they are testing this technology. They are actually hiring people so that they can sit in the front sit of their car that pay them $20 an hour so they can run the task. This technology is n't going to be ready this year or next year, and likely the year after. @!CARLSON# Right. @!DUCEY# There 's many people that will never get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, we think this is good technology, you know, it also helps the disabled. The blind, the elderly, people that ca n't drive. So, there are a lot of conveniences that are possible here. But they have n't come to a fruition yet. @!CARLSON# Right. And there 's a lot that 's good about it. But on the other hand, they are not going to be paying people to drive an autonomous car for long by definition the whole point is to lower labor cost. And this is not uber. The scale is different. I mean, in the majority of states, 29 out of 50, the single most common job is driving for a living. And I believe in this country is the single most common job for many with a high school diploma. So, this is millions and millions of people who are going to be out of work if this technology proceeds as it apparently is. Why should the government be making it easier for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think that its government that 's making it easier, what government is doing, what we are doing in Arizona is simply getting out of the way. This is technology that has n't been proven out yet. But you can either embrace this technology as the state or you can try to shut it down and in Arizona, we are going to be welcoming to new ideas. @!CARLSON# Right. @!DUCEY# Okay. So, the Obama administration has been subsiding this, the Department of Transportation, and so they have every reason to pretend there is no downside. And yet a White House report from last month acknowledged that a lot of this country 's most vulnerable employees are going to be out of work. And then it will increase income inequality. That is their position. So, even they are admitting that. Should n't the companies benefiting from these do something, I 'm not sure what, to alleviate the social dislocation this technology is going to cause. @!DUCEY# Well, the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an economy where jobs are being created and in Arizona, we 've created or the academy has created 100,000 new jobs over the last two years. So, we are doing some things to write, we have openings in the service economy as well. So, in terms of what government should be doing to punish companies for new technologies, I do n't know that that is something that I am in favor of. I want to see an economy that is creating new jobs and opportunities so people have options as we have these conveniences and innovations come to us. @!CARLSON# Right. But not all new technologies produce more jobs than they destroy. In fact, in the last 20 years we 've seen net job loss because of technology. I 'm not against technology. It 's cool. It increases efficiency. But it does n't increase jobs or pay. So, those service industry jobs you mentioned pay less than driving jobs on average. And so the people who make less are more dependent upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So more housing vouchers. More unemployment insurance. More disability. More flat out welfare. The public bares those costs. @!DUCEY# We want to put people to work, we have an economy that is creating jobs here. This is something we 're testing. Here Tucker, we are going to continue to test it and we 're going to continue to attract jobs to our economy. And I mean, you are going to see some turnover. If this is successful. But you will see other opportunities to maintain these vehicles. You will see continual people driving other people. So, I am hopeful as to what is possible here. But at the same time, this is a technology that is moving forward. @!CARLSON# You are absolutely right on all of that, And you are optimistic which I appreciate. Let me ask you one question that I 've been asking a lot of people recently on TV, who is thinking about what happens to all these people? Not just the drivers displaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robotics, by physicians displaced by supercomputers. All the people whose jobs are going away because of technology. What are they going to do and who is thinking about that? Do you know anyone who 's thinking about it? @!DUCEY# Well, I am thinking about Arizonans every day and what is best for them. How I can create more jobs for kids who graduate from high school and college. So, this going to be in a unique and innovative economy, these opportunities are going to be there. But there 's going to be some change. We need to be thinking ahead about how we get people working and employed. @!CARLSON# Yes. Poor California. You are already stealing all of their people. Governor, thanks a lot. @!DUCEY# We will continue. Thank you, Tucker. @!CARLSON# That is true. Well, thanks a lot. @( END VIDEO CLIP) @!CARLSON# Up next, how the cold war comeback so soon in Washington as 1985 again. Russia expert Stephen Cohen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to prevent President Trump from making a deal with Vladimir Putin. He joins us next to explain why exactly. @!CARLSON# Well, no matter how many times they get ridiculed for it, Hollywood celebrities keep making excruciating videos telling the rest of Americans what to think particularly about Donald Trump. It 's self- awareness not their strong suit. Well, this time the celebrity Justice League gathered to sing the song, " I Will Survive, " to show their continued defiance towards the incoming administration. Here 's a clip if you can stand it. @( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL# Did you think I 'd crumble -- @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE# Did you think I 'd lay down and die -- @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL# No, no, not I -- @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL# I will survive. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE# Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I stay alive. @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL# I 've got all my life to live. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE# And I 've got all my love to give. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE# And I will survive. @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL# I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive! @( END VIDEO CLIP) @!CARLSON# So good, I 'd never want that to end. @(LAUGHTER) Well, oddly, I will survive of course is about a woman escaping an ex- boyfriend. this video was made about the wrong president. We will ask. Well, the Washington establishment and its media lackeys remain obsessed with Russian hacking and its alleged influence to November 's elections. Some have even stooped to pushing an unverified document, dossier, claiming Trump has been compromised by Russian intelligence. Russia is the biggest bogeyman that 's been in years, but at the same time few people have been talking about its actual thinking, what are Russia 's motives, if any? What could they gain or lose by working with the Trump administration? In other words, nobody talking about it knows anything about Russia. Stephen Cohen does. He is a contributing editor at " The Nation " and the professor emeritus of Russian studies at NYU. He used teach at Princeton.( INAUDIBLE) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks for coming on. @!STEPHEN-COHEN, -CON# So, what could possibly be on your mind tonight? Whether or not we 're actually going to survive? @!CARLSON# Well, there is this amazing moment and I 'm sure you saw it during the Tillerson -- Rex Tillerson hearings in the Senate. When Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, essentially demanded that Tillerson denounce Vladimir Putin as a war criminal. Now, I do n't know -- I 'll be candid with you, I do n't know much about Vladimir Putin 's war record and perhaps he is war criminal. I don ' know. But I was so struck by Rubio 's insistence that Tillerson concede that he was. Would America gain something, do you think, from an incoming Secretary of State calling the Russian head of state a war criminal? @!COHEN# No, because it would end what president-elect Trump says he wants to do. And that 's create a new policy toward Russia that we use to call they taunt( ph), cooperation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very simple decision in front of us. Perhaps the worst relationship with Russia in our time perils anywhere from the Baltic to Ukraine to Syria to guys running around as you and I talk tonight, Tucker, terrorists looking for radioactive material to make bombs and if they set them off, we wo n't be able to inhabit those places for a generation. Trump seems to understand this. He seems to understand that we ca n't deal with these problems without Russian cooperation. And meanwhile, you get in this country, already, a bloodied war against Trump hardly because he wants to do this. Did I hear Representative Lewis saying on your broadcasts a few minutes ago that he does n't recognize Trump as a legitimate president? @!CARLSON# That 's right. @!COHEN# Well if that 's the case then what about the leaders of the states Trump has to deal with around the world? Are they supposed to regard Trump as an illegitimate president? @!CARLSON# Well Trump will have control of our nuclear arsenal so they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm wondering about the motive here. Obviously some of it is to tarnish Trump before he takes office. But the antipathy toward Russia seems real from a lot of the ideologues in process( ph) and probably Senator Rubio is one of them. And I 'm not degrading. I 'm just trying to understand it. Why? Why are they so anti-Russia? With all the threats we face, why Russia? @!COHEN# Well, in a word, and again let me take the political Fifth Amendment. I 'm not a partisan of Trump. I 'm not a partisan of Putin. I 'm a partisan of American national security. They do n't know the dangers. They do n't know Putin 's real role in the world. He is far from the greatest threat to America. Think back. Well, you probably were n't born then, but you know the history. Remember what Ronald Reagan did. He had called. He had risen to power. He had embraced the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1985, the reasons -- good reasons of his own -- he decided he wanted to do a grand daytime with the new Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. And you do n't remember but I will tell you that his own party, the Republican Party savaged him, said he was betraying the cause. @!CARLSON# I remember. @!COHEN# They could n't attack his character as they do Trump. But can you imagine -- can you imagine if Reagan had been so slurred( ph) in the American press? So, Reagan is actually the model for Trump. At that time, it with the evil empire. Today, Putin is the Darth Vader of the east. It is n't true. I mean, the threat that Putin represents to the United States, I would rank probably would n't make the top five. But they 're testifying in Congress that it 's number one -- @!CARLSON# Yes. @!COHEN# And this is a threat to our own national security. Look -- @!CARLSON# They seem that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I just want to affirm as a non-Russian expert, the way you 're saying comports with common sense. It does seem like hysteria has seized D.C. @!COHEN# And we 're in danger as a result. @!CARLSON# It seems that way. Professor Cohen, thank you so much for joining us. Good to see you. Up next, two men are trying to restore the vote to 1.7 million ex-felons in the state of Florida. If they succeed, it could cause a seismic shift in national politics. There joining us in a minute to explain why we need to do it. Stay tuned. @!CARLSON# Well the inauguration is not just a week away and the Secret Service is working phonetically to make it one of the most secure events in history, but they 're concerned.( INAUDIBLE) security situation here in Washington, we 're joined by Fox News chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge. Good to see you Catherine. How worried are they? @!CATHERINE-HERRIDGE : Well, look Tucker, there are two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago. I 'd put it this way. They 're very focused on the lone wolf actor and what you 'll see along the inauguration route and the sort of secured perimeter -- large dump trucks with cement or sand. Kind of what we saw in Time Squared for New Year 's Eve and also the Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade. That 's to prevent these ISIS inspired terrorists from using trucks as weapons to mow down civilians. The second change is concern about UAV 's or drones. And they have an ability to deliver a payload. So, we went to the Secret Service site at Maryland where they were doing training this week. And what you can see there on the screen is they use a UAV, in this case, it 's a mock up to do the delivery of a chemical agent. So that 's the kind of scenario that they 're also prepared for. So, that thing that 's so unique about this event is that they have to really be ready for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paved( ph) route, they got to know how to deal with that. And they also have to know how to deal with someone who 's a lone wolf or even the use of a chemical agent. @!CARLSON# So without being specific you can reassure us that it is possible to prepare for the UAV gas attack. @!HERRIDGE# Yes, it is. Yes, based on their training. That 's one of the things that they do. They also do the exercises you were just seeing in the video but they also do what are called tabletop( ph) exercises, sort of like what it is that we 're doing right here. You kind of talk through different scenarios and it is a way to make sure everyone is on the same page as sort of very reinforcing a tabletop and then also a drill at a site like we saw out in Maryland. @!CARLSON# Catherine Herridge, who works longer hours than anyone in this building. @!HERRIDGE# No, except you. I 'm dedicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catherine. It 's great to see you. Well, three U.S. states deprive convicted felons of the right to vote for the rest of their lives. One of those is Florida and they are 1.7 estimated million people who are disenfranchised due to a prior felony conviction. Florida has been decided by fewer than 200,000 votes in three of the past five presidential races. So, it 's a meaningful number. Could these lost votes be having a big effect on the outcome of presidential elections? Joining us now, two men who served their time. They say they should be able to vote again. If they succeed, could votes like theirs swing the 2020 elections? Joining us now, Desmond Meade and Neil Volz, both of them with felony convictions, both campaigning to return the franchise to Florida felons. It 's great to see you both. I 've got to say I have mixed feelings on this topic but Desmond, the question that always comes immediately to mind with restoring the vote to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to carry a gun so why would we trust you to choose the next president? @!DESMOND-MEADE, -PRE# Well, first of all good evening, Tucker and thank you for having us on the show. You know, we 're really excited about what 's going on in Florida because it 's a group of ordinary American citizens from all walks of life, from all political persuasion, that believe in second chances, that believe in having a more inclusive democracy, that believes in just fairness, you know. And when you talk about America, you know, I 'm reminded of George Bush -- George W. Bush 's when he said that America is a nation of second chances. And when that door in prison open, that we society should do everything it can to help facilitate a successful re-entry because it 's society 's best interests. It helps to increase public safety, it increases contributors to the tax space and it 's all about fairness. This is a country of second chances. @!CARLSON# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's why as I said, I have mix feelings in this because I believe in redemption, and I mean that. But you did n't answer the question which is, if we do n't trust you to have a firearm or to serve on a jury, or to serve in the military, or to serve as a teacher, why would we trust you enough to make a decision as profound as who the next president is going to be? @!NEIL-VOLZ, -MEMBER, # Let me it take a crack at that, Tucker -- @!CARLSON# Thank you. @!VOLZ# -- and thanks a lot for having us on. We do n't really have an opinion on that, but what I like to tell you is -- @!CARLSON# Why? @!VOLZ# -- that according to the Florida Parole Commission, people who are - - people involved are three times less likely to re-offend if they 've had their voting rights restored. We think that 's a huge deal. Why is that? It 's a huge deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cycle of crime which means we can have safer communities in Florida. It also shows that the individual who is trying to grasp at that second chance, something we 're all familiar with, that that allows people with better opportunity to restore their families to re-engage with their communities, get jobs. And we think that 's a win-win worth focusing on. And that 's what we 're focused on right now because we say this will make for a better Florida. @!CARLSON# that 's great, but it does n't prove it by the way. It 's suggestive but I 'm willing to believe it. But you 're not answering the core question, which is this is not just about the felons, it 's about the other 325 million people who live in this country who want the best possible government they can get. And I find it a little odd that the Democratic Party pushes so hard for enfranchisement for felons without ever answering the obvious question which is will get us wiser, more capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do, when you talk about people that are pushing this, what I see is that when Charlie Crist was governor of Florida and over 155,000 people were able to have their rights restored, he was a Republican at that time. We 're not saying the first changes in Virginia, the governor and the attorney general were Republican. And the biggest proponent for this is Senator Rand Paul who has been a champion for this cause for quite a number of years. And so I know -- @!CARLSON# Then I will ask him -- I will ask him the same question then. I mean can you re-assure me because this affects my life too. I 'm going to have to live under the president that you choose. And so will this make it more likely that we get better politicians, I mean that 's a fair question @!VOLZ# Well, and is it -- that is the goal, right. We want to have a better society and so for us, we look at those nearly 2 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that those are 2 million people, those are 2 million families. Those are 2 million, you know, stories. If you 're a person( INAUDIBLE) like me, those are 2 million sons and daughters of God. People with potential and that potential right now, Tucker, is sitting on the sideline in far too many instances. And we want to help those people get back onto the game so that they can really help make us a better Florida. @!CARLSON# But wait a second Neil. You 're making me less sympathetic to your case which I 'm -- I 'm sympathetic to you. I want to see -- I had lunch the other day with a felon. He 's a good friend of mine. I want them back in society. But I also just wonder why you care more about voting than you do about your ability again to serve in the military or to serve on the jury or to be a teacher or a cop or fireman. All these are barred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felons to full citizenship, why is it just voting that we 're focused on? What is so( INAUDIBLE). @(CROSSTALK) @!MEADE# In the state of Florida, they have what they call a single subject rule. You could only deal with one thing at a time. And so when you look at the state of Florida and where a person can loose the right to vote for releasing human filled balloons in the air, disturbing turtle nesting aids( ph), burning a tire in public or even driving on a suspended license, and once that person lose their rights, they have to wait five or seven years - - @!CARLSON# I get it. @!MEADE# -- if they have completed their sentence. But it 's more than that, Tucker, because after they wait their five and seven years, what we see here in Florida is that there is an additional 10-year waiting period -- @!CARLSON# OK. I know. I get it. @!MEADE# -- and so we 're talking about making an American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And a lot of those -- @!CARLSON# Trust me -- @!MEADE# -- are veterans who have put their lives on the line for this country. They 're fighting in Iraq and they come back -- @!CARLSON# I get it. I get it. We 're out of time. No @!MEADE# -- get in a bar fight, and you 're going to say I ca n't vote? @!CARLSON# No, but I want to say this to be able to cops and soldiers and jury foreman also, and let 's just make it bigger than just voting. They should be able to go to the shooting range with you. We 're out of time. Gentlemen, thank you for joining us. @!MEADE# We thank you Tucker. @!VOLZ# We appreciate it. @!CARLSON# Thank you. Well President Obama got the Presidential Medal Of Freedom. He gave it to Joe Biden yesterday and he awarded it with distinction, something that 's only happened three times in the past 24 years. The other recipients you may remember were Colin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. All of whom played integral roles in liberating whole nations from tyranny. Everyone likes Joe Biden, he 's pretty likable but what exactly did he do to deserve an accolade like this? Let 's see, he represented America 's second smallest state in the Senate for 36 years and he was Obama 's running mate twice. Well that award comes a week after Ash Carter gave Obama the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service, presumably for his great wartime heroics in defense of this nation. Obama likely added to his mighty chest of medals right next to his Nobel Peace Prize. We 'll keep you posted. Up ahead, king for a day. What would you do with absolute power for 24 hours? We ask you the question and you responded as you always do. Up next, Ed Henry joins us in " The Friend Zone ". @!CARLSON# Time now for " The Friend Zone. " We invite one of our pals within the building here at Fox onto the show and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ed Henry. ED HENRY, CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS : Great to see you. @!CARLSON# You know him from years of watching and you think that Ed Henry is a really good guy, really nice guy. I saw, Ed, the other day, Jim Acosts went after Trump and started barking at this press conference and I thought, where have I seen that before? @(LAUGHTER) @!CARLSON# I saw it from Ed Henry. @!HENRY# Yes. I 've done some of that -- @!CARLSON# I remember that. @!HENRY# I was trying to go through my closet today because of the inaugural and I thought I 'd bring you some props. This is a little skully cap I got 44th president Obama from ' 09 Inaugural, OK. @!CARLSON# Nice. @!HENRY# And I got this t-shirt from when Saddam Hussein was captured, " Ace in the Hole. " Remember George W. Bush had all those cards -- @!CARLSON# Yes. @!HENRY# -- in the Oval Office. @!CARLSON# I remember that. @!HENRY# They got him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was when I was pressing the Bush White House and you see it says " Zip it, Henry. " @!CARLSON# Yes I do. @!HENRY# There 's a story behind it that -- @!CARLSON# That 's Tony Snow. @!HENRY# Tony Snow. @!CARLSON# Of course, the former press secretary @!HENRY# Former Fox News and then he was the Bush press secretary. It 's a fun story and a sad story because what happened was, I was really battling with Tony Snow because what Jim Acosta is doing. Look, did he got a little far, sure. But you 've got to push power where there 's Democrat -- @!CARLSON# I agree completely. @!HENRY# -- and you do this in your show. And at one point Tony Snow got so exasperated with my questions he said, " Zip it, Henry. " And the whole room just stopped and the White House -- we 're going, what in the world? @!CARLSON# Have you worked with him before he crossed? @!HENRY# I was at CNN so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little undercurrent that he had been at Fox and I was at CNN. He really wanted to stick to me. So I get invited in the Palm here in Washington with some close friends. I know you love the Palm, and that 's why I wanted to tell you the story. So I 'm sitting there on a Friday with some friends and they surprised me this t-shirt and they say, not only do we get you this t-shirt, " Zip it, Henry " which sort of makes fun of you but showed you stood up to him, but we leaked it to the reliable source and you 're going to do a huge item on Monday about how your friends brought this t-shirt, " Zip it. Henry " because you 're battling the White House. I do n't know if I really wanted to pay for it but that 's funny. Literally during the lunch I get a phone call from one of my bosses at CNN saying can you talk? Can you walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to believe this but Tony Snow just had a recurrence of cancer. CARLSON : Oh gosh. @!HENRY# I said what?! And so I had this mixed reaction of and I 'm getting emotional and I 'm thinking about it saying, first of all, I ca n't believe Tony is sick again and sadly, he died very shortly after that. And everyone at the White House Press Corp and you see him there, it was mourning( ph) it. But I was also thinking, I 've got to go back in this restaurant and tell my friends to call the " Washington Post " and not do an item about how I was celebrating on Friday at the Palm about my confrontation with Tony Snow. I do n't know -- I 'm telling you this story in part because, these things can get out of control sometimes. You 're battling and battling and after one of our other battles in the White House briefing room, a few hours later, we were out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House and Tony got in really close to me and we 're talking and his assistant, Ed Buckley, who is still in Washington, came up and he keep running up because he thought we were fighting. And he said I got to separate you two, you know, you 're even fighting out here. And Tony turned to him and said, Ed, do n't worry, you do n't understand. Ed 's got a job to do and I 've got a job to do as well. There is nothing personal here. And I always think back to Tony because he was somebody who got that even when he was at the podium being skewered by me or Jim Acosta or someone else, he got that when you 're in power, you 're going to have to face tough questions. And we got to remember that on our side where we got to ask tough questions, but there 's got to be class and grace and respect on both sides. @!CARLSON# It takes decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had that. @!CARLSON# Yes, he certainly did. @!HENRY# Not me, but Tony Snow had that. That 's my point. @!CARLSON# By the way, I just checked the Amazon for Ed 's ranking, your book is killing it. I hope to come back when it 's out. @!HENRY# Every time you mention it, " 42 Faith " it jumps up. I appreciate it. April 4th. @!CARLSON# Are you kidding. Thank you Ed. @!HENRY# Thanks. @!CARLSON# Coming up, what would our loyal viewers do if they were given absolute corrupting power over America? We 'll tell you in our " King for A Day " segment, which is up next. @!CARLSON# Time for my favorite segment, " King for A Day. " You told us what you would do if you had absolute control of this country for a single 24 hour period, and here 's what you wrote. America, @inclusiveUK tweeted, " I 'd make Chuck Schumer wear a Make America Great Again cap and sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd watch that. Barbara( ph) Wetzel said, " Legalizing drugs is the first step. Why do n't we talk about that? Why is this always swept under the rug? " Well many states just did. We 'll see if that makes things better. @JaneC tweeted, " Disable all social media, online chat, and online news outlets for 24 hours and ask people to talk to one another! " Wow. @MacornWenden said, " Every congressman should live in the worst place in their state for 30 days and then report on how they 've improved the areas. " Boy, that 's brilliant. I love it. @FlyingEagle tweeted, " Heal the racial divide. We 're all Americans First. " Amen. @AlleyTaft said, " Let California secede. " And we 'll end on that " King for A Day. " We will see you Monday at 9:00. Our friend Martha MacCallum is starting --
