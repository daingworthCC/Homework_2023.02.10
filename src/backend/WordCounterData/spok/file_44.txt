226741 HATTIE @!KAUFFMAN, co-host : We continue our coverage of the crisis in Kosovo with a look at the impact of the war on children and what 's being done to help them cope with the trauma of what they 've been through. Thalia Assuras joins us again, this time from Kukes, near the Kosovo-Albanian border. Good morning, Thalia. @!THALIA-ASSURAS-rep : Good morning, Hattie. And in fact, I 'm standing in one of the many squatter camps that have exploded throughout the trown of -- town of Kukes. As you can see, the refugees are living in the backs of their trucks. They 're being protected from the elements -- although it 's sunny today, protected from the elements by what is plastic sheeting. There are thousands of refugees here, women and children, mainly. Sixty percent of the refugees are children. And you can imagine they are having a hard time coping. A single voice singing a folk tune in praise of Kosovo, conveys what these refugee children have been through. Unidentified Teen :( Singing in foreign language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women, members of UNICEF 's psychosocial team, are providing what little emotional therapy they can. Unidentified Girl :( Foreign language spoken) @!ASSURAS : Perida Rushidi produces a poetry recital. This little girl declares in a loud voice : ' I am a refugee. ' She speaks of houses being burned, Kosovo being emptied by brutal force. UNICEF says the majority of the youngsters here, and there are thousands, have been severely traumatized. The result, either hyperactivity or extremely passive behavior. And you can see it in the lack of bounce in their step, the dearth of smiles while playing a game. And their drawings, another form of therapy, reveals so much of what they 've seen and may be harboring inside, menacing soldiers, tanks, burning houses. We thought you 'd want to know a little bit more of how these children are coping, so joining us right here at the camp is Elvana Zhezha. She 's been working with the children for quite a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tell us about how these children are really dealing with all of this? @!Ms-ELVANA-ZHEZHA-@ : So the first thing is that one -- what -- which is helping them most is the fact that they are in Albania. It means that they are speaking the same language as before and they found all Albanians waiting them and putting them in their houses. And if you see the children, the -- most of them are smiling and this shows that they 're good here and they feel good. @!ASSURAS : They feel good. But are they having difficulty sleeping at night? Are they crying? I mean, you do see a lot of the children crying and -- and -- and not -- not smiling often as well. @!Ms-ZHEZHA : Yes, not all the children can react in the same way to their trauma. So it means that we had many cases of -- of really big trauma. And we are treating these kinds of cases. But what we are trying to do the -- most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use this therapy in group. And this means to keep them together to sing, to play, to tell stories, or even to paint or to draw something. @!ASSURAS : How does that help them? @!Ms-ZHEZHA : Yes, it helps a lot because they feel that -- there are people that -- which are thinking of them here in Kukes. And, you know, they need their school. And I think the good thing to do after is to think what is going to be with them, about how they can continue to -- to learn or... @!ASSURAS : Exactly. How -- I 've seen -- it is a little noisy around here sometimes. There are a lot of children have been having... @!Ms-ZHEZHA : It is a beautiful thing. @!ASSURAS : It is a beautiful thing, is n't it? They -- sometimes they are running and playing. The pictures that we saw, for example, what are the children telling you about what they 're drawing? And -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were different when they can -- came than now. @!Ms-ZHEZHA : Yes, in the first days, it was -- we found them painting only houses. It means that they were missing their home. And now, as a week passed, we find children draw tanks and guns and houses burned. It means that now they 're realizing what is happening or maybe what they left there. And what is -- the reality here. @!ASSURAS : And in terms of some of the -- some of the songs that they 're singing... @!Ms-ZHEZHA : Oh, all of their songs are about homeland, about Kosovo and about the heroes of Kosovo. @!ASSURAS : And did they tell you about what happened to them? @!Ms-ZHEZHA : Yes. The -- most of them, but not all of them, because in this special cases, you find children, even if they remember what happened, they begin to tremble and to have this big problems of stress. @!ASSURAS : Well, what do you mean, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the children? @!Ms-ZHEZHA : It means that we must be near to them and not to stress them to tell our stories. It means that we must wait until the child began to -- to tell the story by himself. @!ASSURAS : What are some of the difficult cases you saw? You were telling me a little bit earlier about one family. @!Ms-ZHEZHA : Yes, many of the children has been surviving about massacres and about this -- this kind that had surround their houses and about the big noise. They are still scared, even from peoples with uniforms. It means that they are -- they have been scared from the Serb police. @!ASSURAS : And how do you help those children? @!Ms-ZHEZHA : Oh, actually, we try to keep them telling the story and as much as they tell the story, after they will find themselves like remembering a fairy tale or -- you know, it 's -- I do n't know, it 's a matter of counseling. It means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how to deal with -- with this kind of problem. @!ASSURAS : And in terms of -- of waking up at night because of loud noises, you told me that they -- they -- they have nightmares. What do you do about that? How do you teach them not to do that? @!Ms-ZHEZHA : Actually, the families are working on that because we try to speak to the parents and they know how to calm down the -- the children. But what helps a lot is that these families are in big number and it means that they stay all together and this helps a lot. @!ASSURAS : It really helps a lot. One more question. How are you coping with this? You, personally? You wanted to be here. @!Ms-ZHEZHA : Oh, yes, and I still want to be here because I feel that -- I feel good when I stay with children and when I play together with them. Sometimes we like to be as children. @!ASSURAS : Well, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We thank you for joining us. @!Ms-ZHEZHA : Thank you. @!ASSURAS : Good luck to you. @!Ms-ZHEZHA : Thank you very much. @!ASSURAS : Now, Hattie, it 's back to you in New York. @!KAUFFMAN : Thalia, I did n't realize 60 percent of the refugees are children. That 's incredible. Thank you for that report. Now here 's Mark. @!MARK-McEWEN-@1Co-h : It is 15 1/2 after the hour. Next, a new ad campaign to fight so-called ' racial profiling ' by police when CBS THIS MORNING continues. @(Announcements)
