4103941 @!KOTB, co-host : So this... @!KATHIE-LEE-GIFFORD: We just ca n't stay out of trouble. @!KOTB: We ca n't. All right. So you guys remember the song " Call Me Maybe " and we had our own sort of dance version to it with the -- with the legs stuck up in the air. @!GIFFORD: Who could forget? @!KOTB: Let 's just watch that and relive the Spanx moment again for a second. @(Clip-from-previous @!KOTB: It 's not easy. OK, that was n't easy. @!GIFFORD: It still cracks me up. @!KOTB: Stop it! @!GIFFORD: You 're... @!KOTB: If you have long heavy legs, it 's hard for them not to do that. @!GIFFORD: They 're not heavy, they 're just wobbly. @!KOTB: OK. So last night, as you guys know, Jay Leno decided to have a little fun with that exact same song, so here is -- here 's Leno 's version. @(Clip-from- " The-Ton @!KOTB: Genius. @!GIFFORD: As if they do n't have anything else to do, you know what I mean? @!KOTB: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So. @!KOTB: Front page of the papers today, you guys. @!GIFFORD: Yes. @!KOTB: Some funny headlines. This one says " Rack and Run. " @!GIFFORD: " Rack and Ruin. " @!KOTB: " Rack and Ruin. " Exactly what I said, please pay attention. All right. So this young lady is working at a lingerie store and she claims that the owners, the managers and stuff, said that she was way too voluptuous and sexy to be working dressed as she was in her store. @!GIFFORD: Provocatively, because I guess they are of an orthodox faith or something like that. @!KOTB: Yeah, it 's an orthodox employers, right. So she took exception to that. And they told her apparently to put on a big red bathrobe and walk around, and she did n't like that. So she, in this paper, one of the papers, she took a picture of herself in a red bathrobe. @!GIFFORD: And is she suing them for dismissal? @!KOTB: She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... @!KOTB: Oh, it 's a discrimination lawsuit. @!GIFFORD:... has filed a gender and religious discrimination complaint with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in New York. @!KOTB: So what do you make of this, this young lady who says... @!GIFFORD: Well, you know, it 's kind of funny, it comes -- all this stuff 's happening right around the time Maxim magazine comes out with their 100 most gorgeous hottest women in the world, and they picked Bar Refaeli... @!KOTB: Mm-hmm. @!GIFFORD:... beautiful Israeli model, and I do n't think anybody is going to question who comes in first, second or third or... @!KOTB: Mm-hmm. @!GIFFORD:... even 10th on that list, right? @!KOTB: Right, right. @!GIFFORD: But then when other people, shall we say, stand up and make accusations that they 're so hot that they -- nobody can just bear their hotness... @!KOTB: Right. @!GIFFORD:... it 's just -- it 's just a -- there are others that have been doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's a trend and a disturbing one. @!KOTB: Yeah, the tan mom... @!GIFFORD: Remember this? @!KOTB:... remember, she -- yeah, she thinks this. Let 's look. @!Ms-PATRICIA-KRENTC:( From videotape) There 's somebody out there my whole life that does n't like me because they 're jealous, they 're fat and they 're ugly. @!KOTB: Well, there you have that. @!GIFFORD: And then back in April, remember, British writer Samantha Brick wrote this essay that started this whole thing in the Daily Mail about how other women hate her because she is so attractive. @!KOTB: Yeah, here 's her quote, she said, " Women hate me for no other reason than for my lovely looks, " and she said that " throughout my adult life I 've regularly had bottles of bubbly or wine sent to my restaurant or table by men I do n't know. Whenever I 'd ask what I 've done to deserve such treatment, the donors of these gifts have always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile just made their day. " People are unbelievable, right? @!GIFFORD: And then in 2010, a Citibank worker, Debralee... @!KOTB: La, la, la. @!GIFFORD:... Lorenzana said she was fired for, doggone it, being too sexy. @!KOTB: Too pretty. Sexy. @!KOTB: She 's currently fighting -- her former lawyer, Gloria Allred... @!KOTB: Yeah. @!GIFFORD:... and the case is -- that Gloria 's a busy woman. I 'm glad to see that the system 's working for Gloria. @!KOTB: I do -- it does take moxie, though, to get up and say, ' Here 's why -- I 'm so distracting because I 'm so pretty that people ca n't work around me. ' @!GIFFORD: I -- it 's just incredible to me... @!KOTB: Yeah. @!GIFFORD:... that people have the moxie to say such a thing. I mean, Angelina Jolie, who I think people would say is among the most -- world 's -- if not the world 's most beautiful... @!KOTB: @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!KOTB: Never. No, never, never. @!GIFFORD: Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, Hoda, I 've always told you this. @!KOTB: Yes. And speaking of hotness, you had a fun lunch yesterday, did n't you? @!GIFFORD: Who 's hotter than this? Yesterday Frank and I went to the Greenwich Hyatt up in Old Greenwich, Connecticut, to a luncheon that the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the Connecticut -- the chapter put on to honor our dear friend Meredith and her -- and her amazing husband Richard. And -- who has been suffering with MS since he was 25 years old. @!KOTB: Mm-hmm. @!GIFFORD: And the two of them were honored and the two of them spoke. @!KOTB: Mm-hmm. @!GIFFORD: And, you know, so many of these luncheons and these dinners and things that you go to, they 're just sort of cold, you know, they 're just sort of... @!KOTB: Mm-hmm. Impersonal. @!GIFFORD: You raise money for a good cause and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving on so many levels. @!KOTB: Yeah. @!GIFFORD: Number one, they 're both great speakers. @!KOTB: Mm-hmm. @!GIFFORD: Number two, to see the dynamic between the two of them and to see the love that they have for one another which is just authentic, but then to see how raw they both are about everything and how honest, really just honest -- and I -- there was n't a dry eye in the house. It was just sensational. @!KOTB: Richard wrote a great book called " Stronger in the Broken Places. " @!GIFFORD: Yeah. @!KOTB: And I think a lot of people who 've been through a life-threatening illness or something that 's really been debilitating -- he did figure out how to get strong in those spots. @!GIFFORD: Yes. @!KOTB: And he 's just -- he 's inspirational. And she is so raunchy and funny. @!GIFFORD: Oh, my gosh. @!KOTB: By the way, was she really -- what 'd she do? @!GIFFORD: I ca n't tell you half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!GIFFORD: But the thing about Richard, I really did n't know how hysterically funny he is, too. @!KOTB: Mm-hmm. @!GIFFORD: He 's talking about all of this and then he goes, ' My next book 's called " I 'm Going to Kill the Dog. " Because he hates their new dog Jasper, so. @!KOTB: He hates Jasper? @!GIFFORD: You know -- hates him, wants to kill him. He wo n't kill him, of course, it 's just that he... @!KOTB: Yeah. @!GIFFORD:... he can find no redeeming qualities in this dog. @!KOTB: All right. @!GIFFORD: Anyway. @!KOTB: So a little later in the show we have Jimmy Fallon with us. @!GIFFORD: Why? Why is he coming over here to bother us? @!KOTB: Because he wrote a new book. No, it 's called " Thank You Notes 2. " Remember, he wrote the first one? @!GIFFORD: I did n't like " Thank You Notes 1. " Why are we having him on again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new CD coming out. I mean... @!KOTB: Oh, wait, is he in -- oh, he 's in the greenroom. @!GIFFORD:... the man -- I mean why? @!KOTB: Yeah. I do n't... @!GIFFORD: It 's... @!KOTB: You know -- yes. And, you know, he 's -- we all remember him from slow-jamming with President Obama, so Jimmy... @!GIFFORD: I don't. @!KOTB: Well, watch it and you 'll remember. @(Clip-from- " Late-Ni @!KOTB: Come on. Only Jimmy. @!GIFFORD: All right, he does have one or two redeeming qualities. @!KOTB: Anyway, he 'll be with us. @!GIFFORD: Now only in New York, and perhaps Jimmy can tell us if he 's going to buy this, he 's the one that makes the big bucks at " Late Night. " There is going to be a million-dollar parking space. It 's hard to believe. But it 's right next-door or part of -- it 's -- if you 're willing to buy a $39 million penthouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably going to go more than for a million dollars. The person buying the penthouse gets first crack at that, Hoda. @!KOTB: Can I tell you, it -- look, this is how big it is, just so you know, 12 feet by 23 feet. @!GIFFORD: And 15 feet high. @!KOTB: Twelve feet wide, 23 feet. That 's how much space you 're getting and you 're paying a million dollars for it. That is ridiculous. @!GIFFORD: But think about it, you could amortize it because it 's high enough to be able to put in one of those rising little ones and put your sports car on top of that. @!KOTB: Can you imagine spending a million dollars to park your car in a spot? That is unbelievable. @!GIFFORD: There will be an auction for this thing, yes. @!KOTB: All right. So we are... @!GIFFORD: They 've been waiting long enough, they 're bored to death. @!KOTB:... we 're burying the lead because it is " Dateline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right. And we have the four hotshots of " Dateline NBC " in the house. They 're right behind the newsdesk boozing it up. Josh Mankiewicz, as you see. Chris Hansen, famous for " Predator. " Dennis Murphy, one of the finest writers in the building. Keith Morrison -- you know, no one delivers... @!GIFFORD: A line. @!KOTB:... no -- like Keith. @!GIFFORD: You have no idea, Keith, when you 're talking... @!KOTB: Yes. @!GIFFORD:... what it does to Hoda. @!KEITH-MORRISON-rep: Oh. @!GIFFORD: I 'm sorry. @!KOTB: Oh, it 's a total... @!GIFFORD: I am sorry, but she 's in -- she 's -- it -- how can I say it? @!KOTB: Do n't say it. @!GIFFORD: It 's something to do with her Spanx. @!KOTB: Do n't... @!GIFFORD: Yeah. It just gets crazy. It gets crazy. @!MORRISON: It 's even better when you 're with her, actually. @!GIFFORD: What? @!DENNIS-MURPHY-repo: Hoda, you 're with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us. @!KOTB: Why do n't you guys come over here? @!MURPHY: You 're us. @!GIFFORD: No, no, you... @!KOTB: No, no, no, come over here, come over here. @!GIFFORD: They 've got their drinks over there. @!KOTB: Bring your -- bring your drinks -- bring your drinks and come over. @!CHRIS-HANSEN-repor: Drinks? @!KOTB: Bring your drinks, come on over. @!JOSH-MANKIEWICZ-re: Yeah. @!MORRISON: All right. @!KOTB: And while they 're walking over... @!GIFFORD: Miss Bossy Pants. @!KOTB: I know. But while they 're walking over we 're going to show a little bit of Keith... @!MORRISON: Uh-oh. @!KOTB:... being -- I do n't know -- " SNL " having some fun with Keith while they 're walking over. @!GIFFORD: Oh, I love this. Come on over, guys. @!KOTB: Let 's watch. Come on over. @(Clip-from- " Saturda @!KOTB: So you guys, what 's in store for the big anniversary special? @!MORRISON: Chopping up a husband. @!KOTB: Uh-huh. @!GIFFORD: Ooh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying -- Keith saying the word " murder. " @!KOTB: Murder. And, Chris, all your " Predator " stuff, are we going to see kind of a re-do of all that? @!HANSEN: We 're going to see the best of... @!KOTB: Yeah. @!HANSEN:... and then some of the other confrontations we 've had on other topics over the years. @!KOTB: Can you imagine when Chris walks in a room? @!GIFFORD: It 's like when Mike Wallace used to do " 60 Minutes "... @!KOTB: Yeah. @!GIFFORD:... you do n't want him showing up at the door. @!KOTB: No. @!MURPHY: Yeah. Mike Wallace for you on two. @!HANSEN: Right. @!GIFFORD: Yes, exactly. @!HANSEN: I one time walked into a jewelry store to look for a gift at the last minute... @!KOTB: Yeah. @!HANSEN:... and the guy showed it to me and sweat started pouring... @!KOTB: Yeah, I would n't doubt it. @!HANSEN: And he said -- he said, ' Do you have a hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man, I 'm just trying to get a last-minute gift here, you know? @!GIFFORD: Yeah.
