232241 SOLEDAD O'BRIEN, co-host : Just three weeks until Christmas. And if you know someone who loves the great outdoors, we 've got some great gift ideas. Steve Madden is editor in chief of Outdoor Explorer magazine. Good morning to you, Steve. @!Mr-STEVE-MADDEN-@1 : Good morning. O'BRIEN : Thanks for joining us. @!Mr-MADDEN : Thanks for having me. O'BRIEN : You know, it seems like the gift category for outdoor gear is really hot. Does that mean more people are hiking and biking and skiing and doing all those exercisey-type activities? @!Mr-MADDEN : Yep. It means a lot more people are outside. But part of the reason they 're getting outside is the gear is better than it 's ever been. So... O'BRIEN : You can stay out a lot longer than you could before? @!Mr-MADDEN : Absolutely. You can stay warmer, you can stay drier, you can have more fun. O'BRIEN : But if you 're someone like me who does n't know a lot about acto -- outdoor sports activities, it can be kind of difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without giving away that you 're going to buy them a gift. @!Mr-MADDEN : Right. O'BRIEN : You 've got some tips for us. And I want to walk through them. @!Mr-MADDEN : I do. O'BRIEN : So let 's begin with the stocking stuffers. You brought a whole range of stuff. Let 's begin with the socks. @!Mr-MADDEN : I did. These are -- these are Smartwool socks. They 're $ 15. That -- that 's -- that 's a great hiking sock. It 's... O'BRIEN : What is smartwool? @!Mr-MADDEN : It 's made from merino wool which is the original miracle fiber. It 'll keep you warm in the winter, it 'll keep your feet cool in the summer and even I ca n't stink those things up. O'BRIEN : This is a -- I guess a -- a -- a bike tool? @!Mr-MADDEN : Yep. That 's the Alien by Topeek. That 's a bike -- bike tool specifically for mountain biking. It 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you ca n't fix it with that, it 's time to take it to a bike store. O'BRIEN : Is that bike tool worthwhile for other people who maybe not are big bikers? @!Mr-MADDEN : There are... O'BRIEN : Or is it specific for bikers? @!Mr-MADDEN :... it 's specific for mountain biking, in particular. There are other great multitools that you can buy for other activities. O'BRIEN : I love this. I have to tell you, I do n't know where I would use it, but a little headlamp, who... @!Mr-MADDEN : This is... O'BRIEN :... who... @!Mr-MADDEN : This is... O'BRIEN :... who needs this? @!Mr-MADDEN : This is by Princeton Tech. This is the Quest headlamp. It 's -- I think of these things as flashlights that you do n't have to hold. You can put it on your head. I use it for camping and snowshoeing and things like that, but I also use this when I have to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 's not necessarily even into outdoor sports might find this thing useful, then. @!Mr-MADDEN : If you need to have your hands free and you need light, this is a great idea. O'BRIEN : What 's this here? @!Mr-MADDEN : This is -- this is a very basic medical kit, first aid kit. This is -- this is something that you 'd want to take out for hikes or for weekends -- weekend trips. You never want to go out without a first aid kit. Just take care of blisters, cuts, things like that. O'BRIEN : What does something like that run? @!Mr-MADDEN : That 's 23.50. O'BRIEN : And that 's a good gift for anybody who does anything outdoors. @!Mr-MADDEN : Absolutely. O'BRIEN : OK. Let 's turn -- because, of course, you ca n't just give away the stocking stuffers. @!Mr-MADDEN : No. O'BRIEN : Those are very good gifts. We 've got some bigger items as well. And let 's begin with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first one. @!Mr-MADDEN : We have two jackets. This is the Cloud Burst by REI. This will run about $ 125. It 's waterproof, and it 's windproof, and it 's breathable, which is very important. It helps you manage your heat. This is -- this is the Aurora by Mountain Hardware. This is made from packlight, which is the lightest Gore-Tex -- the lightest material that Gore-Tex makes. It 's super breathable, wind-resistant and very, very durable. O'BRIEN : A little more expensive? @!Mr-MADDEN : This is a little more expensive. This runs about $ 400. O'BRIEN : What kind of a sport would you be doing to need that jacket, the really expensive one? @!Mr-MADDEN : This -- this is really great for skiing, mountaineering, anything you 're doing at high altitudes where the wind might be real -- really strong. O'BRIEN : The goggles. You brought two sets as well. Again, goggles that you can buy for someone who needs goggles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!Mr-MADDEN : That 's right. O'BRIEN : Tell me about the first ones. @!Mr-MADDEN : Two sets of goggles. These are -- these are the Scoop by Spy. Problem with goggles, a lot of times is that they fog up. OK? The Scoop will -- will -- has -- has vents that help -- help you manage the fog. This is -- this is by Smith. It 's got a little fan in it -- battery-powered fan. You can turn it on, you can hear the motor going. And it blows air over it so it keeps your goggles clear. You can see what you 're doing. O'BRIEN : What would something like that run? @!Mr-MADDEN : This is expensive. That 's about $ 175, but it 's worth it. Really works. O'BRIEN : For kids, you brought some snowshoes. Now, even if it 's just for snowshoeing around the backyard, these are worthwhile? @!Mr-MADDEN : Right. These are Little Bear snowshoes. These run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Makes it a lot easier for people to get outside in the winter. This will keep the kids off the couch and out of your hair. Put these snowshoes on under a pair of boots, they can go outside. O'BRIEN : You 've got some great backpacks. And I know, having gone hiking with a really bad backpack, the backpack is very important. @!Mr-MADDEN : This is -- this is Little Alpine 's Alpine Attack. The thing that makes this backpack so -- so valuable -- it 's a day-pack, you want to take it out on a day hike -- it 's got a special air management system on the back. So you do n't get all sweaty. O'BRIEN : And how about the one next to it? @!Mr-MADDEN : This is a -- this is a hydration system. This is Camelbak 's Mule. This is speci -- specifically for mountain biking. It holds 100 ounces of water in a -- in a bladder that 's built inside here. A tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the fly. Hands-free drinking. O'BRIEN : I like that. @!Mr-MADDEN : It 's very important to stay hydrated when you 're outside. O'BRIEN : That is great. What does that one run? @!Mr-MADDEN : Especially in the winter. This is $ 75. O'BRIEN : And finally, bike helmets? @!Mr-MADDEN : That 's right. We 've got two different kinds of helmets here. These are specifically for mountain biking. Both are made by Giro. This is the Exodus which runs about $ 150. It 's got 21 different vents on it to keep -- help keep your head cool, helps heat get away and brings cool air in as you move forward. And this by Giro is the Torero. That runs about $ 55. Never go out on a bike without a helmet. O'BRIEN : Of course. All great gift ideas for anybody who likes to do anything outdoors. @!Mr-MADDEN : That 's right. O'BRIEN : Steve Madden, thanks very much for joining us this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And still to come on TODAY, an update on the Mars polar landing. What happened on the way down to the Red Planet? But first, this is TODAY on NBC.
