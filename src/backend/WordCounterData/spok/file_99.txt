236041 LINDA WERTHEIMER, Host : This is All Things Considered. I 'm Linda Wertheimer. NOAH ADAMS, Host : And I 'm Noah Adams. The voters of Michigan have a pretty good track record on recent presidential elections, except for in 1976 when they voted for the local hero, President Gerald R. Ford. Since then, Michigan has been in the winning column, and that includes years when pro-labor Democrats left their party to vote for President Reagan. LINDA WERTHEIMER : In our visit to Michigan, we talked workers in the American Axle plant in Detroit. It 's a big place, so we treated it like a small town, visiting with people from all walks of life. On one occasion, we gathered a group from the factory floor of plant number three, which makes rear axles for GM cars and trucks. 1st WORKER : My name is Toyah Russell. I 'd like to direct your attention and welcome you to Group E, 10 and half, of our member line. These gear sets are received from our- LINDA WERTHEIMER : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory floor, with Daniel Marcey, who 's a machinist, Tom Jones, the plant 's union representative, Sam Sanders, a human resources representative, Julius Osteen, who repairs machinery, Yvette Rhodes, who works with customers, and Frank Franklin, who 's a job setter. FRANK FRANKLIN, American Axle Employee : I 'm probably one of the youngest people in here. I just turned 21, so this is probably my first major job. And the money 's great. I 've been working here for about a year and two months. Since then, I 've bought a new car, I 've moved out, you know, I 'm starting to save for a house. - LINDA WERTHEIMER : You moved out of your parents ' house. FRANK FRANKLIN : Yeah. I mean, just the possibilities are infinite. LINDA WERTHEIMER : Tom Jones, what about you? Do you- you- you 've been through a few of the- the swings that the auto industry has taken here in Detroit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity now is great ; business is good. But that do n't mean it 's going to be good this time next year. The young people have to understand that if you do n't set something aside now while you 're working good, that when bad times come upon you, sometimes some people do n't know how to cope with that. LINDA WERTHEIMER : You remember what John Kennedy said about the rising tide lifts all the boats? Good economic times are- are good for everybody. Do you think that 's still true? The tide is certainly rising in Detroit. Is it good for everybody? TOM JONES : I would say it 's about 50-50. Seems like to me those who have it continue to have it, and those that do n't, do n't have it. LINDA WERTHEIMER : Yvette Rhodes, you 're nodding. YVETTE RHODES, American Axle Employee : Ah- laughter I- I 'm in agreement. There 's always people who just seem to kind of be kind of lost in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you 'll see people that are making progress in their lives and things are changing for them and things are getting better. But there 's a core of people that live here in this city that things just do n't change for them. LINDA WERTHEIMER : We 're in the middle of what people are talking about as a revolution. You know, the Republicans in Congress are talking about how we 're having a revolution. How 's it going over? YVETTE RHODES : I think that there 's a tendency not only by Newt Gingrich but people that go to Washington, they kind of lose sight on- on the people that they represent. And what they 're talking about accomplish- accomplishing are things that are important to all of us. You know, we- we all want the country to be economically sound and we know that a balanced budget will contribute to that. But they 're also talking about taking people like off of Medicare and everything and making it harder for them to be able to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though they do n't have a concern for people who have a genuine need to be on welfare. LINDA WERTHEIMER : Welfare reform is- is a big issue. What do you guys, think about welfare? DANIEL MARCEY, American Axle Employee : Well, I think that there are people out there that really do need it. When- when I was a kid growing up, my mother was raising four kids on her own and we were on welfare. And my mother did n't just sit back and just raise the kids and let welfare happen. She went out and she tried to work. She got part-time work, and she did a real good job. But I 'd made up my mind when I was a teenager that this was not the lifestyle I was going after. I was going to put my nose to the grindstone and I was going to work and make sure that my family did better than I did. LINDA WERTHEIMER : What about welfare? Is- what about welfare reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothers, and they want to- they really want to work. They want jobs. They feel like they 're being- they 're doing what their mother did or their grandmother did. Same thing. They 're like in a vicious cycle, and they want out. LINDA WERTHEIMER : What do you think- what do you- what do you think about the governor? The governor is setting out to reform welfare in the state of Michigan at the same time that the whole national program is working out. The governor is- the governor has got his own revolution going, and by all accounts it 's a fairly popular, you know, he 's a popular guy. He was re-elected. What do you think about him, about the governor? 3rd WORKER : I think people in the state of Michigan, all the rich, when if the poor folks start coming up to their houses, knocking on the doors and telling what they got, then that 's not going to go over too good with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And this- this to me is a quick fix, and it 's not going to go over. LINDA WERTHEIMER : It 's a whole year away, of course, but it looks like what we 're headed for is President Clinton runs for re-election against Senator Bob Dole of Kansas. What do you think about your choices, about the quality of your choices? Do you like- do you like having these two to choose among? 3rd WORKER : Yeah, I do. Clinton. LINDA WERTHEIMER : So it 's easy for you? 3rd WORKER : Yes- LINDA WERTHEIMER : No problem? 3rd WORKER : Bill Clinton all the way, when it comes to Bob Dole or Newt. LINDA WERTHEIMER : Sam? SAM SANDERS, American Axle Employee : I would- I would say Clinton 's a pretty good choice, you know? I- I 'm the type of person, you know, I know that it takes more than four years to complete what he wants to do. And I will make my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : What about the notion of having somebody else out there? For a while it looked like we might have Colin Powell, and then it looked like we might have Ross Perot. I mean, is there anybody out there that kind of you look at and you think ' Now, there, you know? If that person were to get into politics I could get excited. ' SAM SANDERS : Well, Colin Powell, of course, was one, because he was a fresh face and he seemed to be a real honorable man. And he seemed to have the American people at heart rather than maybe special interest groups. And, but I guess his- he had to back out because he was n't willing to go into all the dirt-slinging and mudslinging that would have to be involved in that. But I thought he would be a good choice for a president. He would 've had my vote for sure. LINDA WERTHEIMER : If he ran as a Republican? SAM SANDERS : Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote, because he represented something kind of pure. LINDA WERTHEIMER : Do you feel like that 's missing in politics generally? - SAM SANDERS : Yeah, oh definitely. LINDA WERTHEIMER : I see a lot of nods in- What about- what about- what about you, Dan? DANIEL MARCEY : I think Colin Powell definitely seems like a much more honest person than all the politicians we have out there. On the other hand, I think Clinton is doing well. I think they should leave his personal life out of it and let 's deal with politics up front and stop all the mudslinging and back stabbing, and let 's hear what you 've got to say. LINDA WERTHEIMER : That was Daniel Marcey. We also talked to Frank Franklin, Sam Sanders, Tom Jones, Julius Osteen and Yvette Rhodes. Our thanks to Richard Dowk and the people of his company, American Axle and Manufacturing, for sharing what they do and what they 're thinking about with us. If Michigan is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then here are some of things we heard. People do believe that state and local governments run many things better than Washington does, but they worry that programs they or their families use may be cut. In Michigan, where jobs are plentiful, almost everyone thinks almost everyone should work and get off welfare. People did n't like partisan warfare in Congress when the Democrats were in control ; they do n't like it any better now. And in that great American tradition of checks and balances, Michigan voters liked their Republican governor, but if this were Election Day they 'd re-elect the Democratic president.
