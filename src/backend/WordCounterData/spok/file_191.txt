Jeannie decided to stay up and watch the Red Sox game and I turned in early. @!JEANNIE-MCDONOUGH : The weather was very hot. It was extremely oppressive. Shea came home. At her curfew, she has a twelve oclock curfew. She actually came home probably about fifteen minutes beforehand. @!SHEA-MCDONOUGH : To me, I was like, oh, Im doing good. Im doing good on time. I came in and I went straight to the back door just to see if it was unlocked. And I just left it unlocked. Thinking that my brother was coming home that night I wanted to make sure that he wasnt going to text me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you come unlock the door? Its locked. @!JEANNIE-MCDONOUGH : Shea was being a good sister and looking out for her big brother. I neglected to tell her that Ryan had called earlier in the evening and said that he was going to spend the night at his friend Rickys house. I do nt think anyone ever prepares for anything like this to happen to them. I heard a muffled sound, like a little whimper, come from the bedroom right next to us. And I thought that was odd -- Shea must be having a -- a bad dream or something. And Kevin got up at the same time. @!KEVIN-MCDONOUGH : She said Ill check on her. And I said no Ill check on her which really isnt the norm. Usually, Im selfish and want to get all the sleep I need. But that -- that morning something told me to get up. I got up and my wife Jeannie followed me in there. I opened up the door and I saw a black silhouette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the night to a cold object on my neck. I thought it was a gun. I did nt know it was a knife. I just saw dark eyes and a mask. The man spoke and it was a voice that I had never recognized before. And he said if you make any f -- -ing noise Im going to kill you. And thats when I just kind of went into panic mode. And I just started kicking. And I just pushed my back against the bed, hoping to make as much noise as possible so that my parents could wake up and hear me. And my dad the first thing I heard him say was who are you? The man stood up from leaning over me and just went straight for my dad. @!JEANNIE-MCDONOUGH : And we saw a knife in his hand. qwq @( Graphics-on-screen What if someone wants you dead but you " Live to Tell.

He was trying to grab the knife. I was just trying to get out of bed. @!KEVIN-MCDONOUGH : I was saying get the knife, get the knife. @!JEANNIE-MCDONOUGH : The knife was very big. The blade was Im going to say that long. And so I tried to grab the grip of the knife but the mans hand was huge and it was ineffective, it wasnt doing anything. So I just grabbed the blade of the knife because I did nt know what to do. @!KEVIN-MCDONOUGH : I instinctively told my daughter, call 911, and get my gun. I do nt have a gun. But something inside me told me to say that which would keep him on his guard. @!OPERATOR-@1911-rec : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A man came in with a gun and put it to my neck and he hurt both of my parents. @!OPERATOR-@1911-rec : Alright, alright, just relax. @!KEVIN-MCDONOUGH : Hurry up. @!OPERATOR-@1911-rec : Is he still there? @!SHEA-MCDONOUGH : I was so confusing with the dispatcher and I was so flustered that I did nt even know what I was saying on the phone. @!KEVIN-MCDONOUGH : And all of a sudden he got a burst of adrenaline, he erected himself up off the bed with me on his back. Thats when I -- I knew I was in some deep( EXPLETIVES DELETED). @!JEANNIE-MCDONOUGH : When the man stood up with Kevin on his back, the knife slid through my hands. I thought, oh, this is it, were all dead. @!SHEA-MCDONOUGH : It was so stop and go where one minute my dad had him under control and then hed freak out again. And it -- it -- it was scary. @!KEVIN-MCDONOUGH : In high school, I wrestled. I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this size that I had a chance on restraining him and taking him down was if I took his wind out. And I choked him on the throat and threw my weight back and pulled him with me and we hit the floor. @!JEANNIE-MCDONOUGH : And so at that moment I turned around and I grabbed the knife again, I grabbed the blade of the knife again. @!SHEA-MCDONOUGH : And I ran back into the bathroom and saw a lot of blood. And I did nt know what it was coming from, and then I looked down and I saw my mom holding onto the knife for dear life and she wouldnt let go of it. @!JEANNIE-MCDONOUGH : I was pissed. And all I could think about was I need to distract this guy so that he does nt try to do anything else. So Im screaming at him, Im like, what were you thinking? Thats when the man spoke and said I -- I just wanted money. And I heard the accent and Kevin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this? Who is sitting in front of us? @!KEVIN-MCDONOUGH : And he said Im nobody, let me go. And I said to him -- I said youre not going anywhere, you fat( EXPLETIVES DELETED). @!SHEA-MCDONOUGH : When I saw the police come into the driveway, I was ecstatic. I was so relieved and so happy cause I knew that at that point, everything was going to be fine. And the second that the first officer got into the house, he just grabbed the guy and got him under control and everything. I did nt cry. I just immediately hugged my dad. He was really choked up. It really had nt hit him yet. He just -- I do nt think it hit any of us what had happened. @!JEANNIE-MCDONOUGH : As I left the room, Shea was with me. We just held onto each other for a little bit. And I wasnt going to let go of her for the life of me. @!DETECTIVE-GEORGE-T : When I first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect at that point. It was very serious. The sergeant told me that a man had broke into the house. He was heavily armed -- different types of weapons, weapons that Ive never seen before -- Chinese throwing stars, choking wires, along with this horrifying mask. @!KEVIN-MCDONOUGH : After they left our house with this intruder, Jeannie and Shea went by ambulance to the hospital to tend to Jeannies wounds. @!JEANNIE-MCDONOUGH : Ryan was in shock when he found out what happened. He felt bad that he wasnt there that he was spending the night at his friend Rickys house. @!SHEA-MCDONOUGH : And its unfortunate caused he shouldnt because its not his fault in the slightest bit. I think he just wishes that he was there to just protect us. @!JEANNIE-MCDONOUGH : Detective Tyros told me that the man that had broken into our house was a long-haul trucker. His name was Adam Leroy Lane -- lived in North Carolina and was running routes up and down from North Carolina up to Nashua, New Hampshire, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : He had a wife and he had three daughters. That made me sick to my stomach to know. @!DETECTIVE-GEORGE-T : On August 2nd, a few days later, we conducted a search warrant of Adam Leroy Lanes truck. We found his log book, receipts, some more knives. We also found a movie inside of a DVD player. That movies titled Hunting Humans. This movie is about a serial killer that goes around randomly killing people without any motive or reason other than to just kill people. Later I learned that Adam Leroy Lane was on the prowl in our town for approximately five hours. He tried to get into at least three other houses before eventually getting into the McDonoughs residence through an unlocked door. He was out in our town hunting humans that night. We started to think maybe he s done this in other places and just has nt been caught yet. @(Graphics-on-screen) @!TODD-EWALT : Darlene was my wife and friend. Shes my partner in life. Ive known her since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back patio just enjoying the weather, talking on the phone. At ten oclock, I opened the door and told her I was headed to bed and she said shed be up in a little bit and I kind of laughed because I knew better because she just would be out on the phone until late. I just went upstairs and I shut the door. I went to sleep. @(Graphics-on-screen) @!TODD-EWALT : I was just laying in bed and my bedroom door opened up and the guys started screaming and shining flashlights at me. Guys were screaming at me to get my hands in the air. I thought this might be a home invasion or something. And I started to look past the flashlights and stuff and could see the silhouettes of the men standing there. And then I could see guns pointed at me. And then one of the troopers identified himself as a state trooper, so I put my hands in the air. They asked if my son was there and he walked up on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they handcuffed him. I was able to look around. And I see my wifes purse, sitting there with her cell phone and keys on one of the chairs at the kitchen table. And I told my son, we got big problems, your mom wouldnt leave without her phone and her keys. Then I started seeing flash photography going off. I knew that wasnt a good sign. After about three hours one of the detectives came in sat me down. Thats when they told me that Darlene was dead and -- and she was killed at the hands of another person. Thats when things started to fall apart for me. I remember hearing my son scream. He was in the kitchen still handcuffed. He broke the chair he was sitting in. He head butted the refrigerator. Theres still two big dents in it. And --( CRYING). @!ED-MARSICO-JR-@1D : When I arrived, crime scene investigators were already working in the backyard of what Id describe as a typical suburban neighborhood. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a male friend on the phone. Darlenes friend hears the call sort of abruptly end, a sort of muffled sound, an -- an abrupt end to a call that in his experience wouldnt normally happen talking to Darlene. He tells his wife. They hop in their car and drive to Darlenes home where he discovered the body on that back patio. She suffered a fatal stab wound in the neck area and, ultimately, causing her death. @!NICOLE-POGASIC-@1T : I got woke up about six forty-five on the thirteenth from a phone call from my brother. I answered it. And he was like, Nicole, moms dead. Im like what? Youre kidding me. Tell me youre lying. He s like, no, she was murdered last night. And then I just felt my whole life just completely fall apart. @!ED-MARSICO-JR. : As experience has often taught the police and prosecutors, people who are killed at home are most likely to be killed by someone close to them that this was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knew her and someone who had the opportunity to kill her, and most likely, her husband. @!TODD-EWALT : They accused me of killing my wife. They just wanted me to breakdown and say I did it or paid somebody to do it. But I knew I did nt do it. @!NICOLE-POGASIC : Cops took me down to the Pennsylvania State Police barracks where they had my brother and my father. @!TODD-EWALT : I just remember her coming around the corner from the door and just running to me and just grabbing her and holding her and giving her a hug because I just -- there was nothing I could do for her. Nothing I could do to make it better. I just held on to her. @!NICOLE-POGASIC : We both kind of just wanted to rewind time. I never asked myself once if my dad killed my mom because I just knew. My mom had no enemies. She was just a great personality and was just loved by everybody. So it was kind of like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill her? And who would do it? Who could be such a monster? @!JEANNIE-MCDONOUGH : Shortly after the attack, we had to go to court and see our attacker. @(Graphics-on-screen) @!JEANNIE-MCDONOUGH : He was kept in a -- a Plexiglas, bullet-proof partition on the other side of the court from us. He just looked like a caged animal. He was disgusting. @!SHEA-MCDONOUGH : He wont stop staring at me and that was the worst feeling in the entire world. @!KEVIN-MCDONOUGH : I wanted to leap over the railing actually because I was so angry at that point. I mean I really wanted to -- to get a punch in or something. @!KERRY-AHERN-@1Assi : There was no way that we could allow this guy to hit the streets. The judge held Lane without bail, finding that he was a danger to the community as well as to the McDonough family. We did nt know a lot about him at the outset. He had no prior record in the State of Massachusetts, no prior criminal record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, we knew he was one dangerous individual. We put out an all-point bulletin to see if any of the other police departments along the East Coast had had any type of similar incidents in their communities. And one of the first people to respond was a state police trooper out of New Jersey. His name was Geoff Noble. And he had inquired whether or not Adam Lane might have been responsible for a murder that he was investigating down in New Jersey. qwq @( Graphics-on-screen Bloomsbury, New Jersey One day before Sheas attack @!DETECTIVE-SERGEANT : On the morning of Monday, July 30th, 2007, New Jersey troopers responded to the home of Monica Massaro. Miss Massaro had been stabbed multiple times in the sanctity of her own home. It was just the type of crime that someone with an incredible amount of violence and rage would have done. Monica Massaro was a single, thirty-seven-year-old female. She lived by herself. She was very active socially. She had a lot of friends, really lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we would call suspects, specifically and that proved challenging for us. We knew that our victim lived in proximity to a truck stop. We, of course, felt that we should call the Chelmsford, Massachusetts Police Department and just kind of compare notes on the case. Basically, we wanted to know if Adam Leroy Lane was in New Jersey at or near the time Monica Massaro died. So we asked Detective Tyros if he had any evidence -- paperwork, logs, receipts, toll records -- anything that would indicate to us Adam Leroy Lanes route of travel. And all of a sudden, Detective Tyros kind of stops and he goes, hey, I have a receipt here. You know, okay. And he goes its from Bloomsbury, New Jersey. We all looked at each other like did he just say Bloomsbury, New Jersey? When, George? When? And then he gave us the second piece, which was July 29th, 2007, right at the time we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I heard Detective Noble say, George, were coming to Chelmsford. @!DETECTIVE-SERGEANT : When we arrived in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, we immediately started, you know, the questions. Wheres the evidence? You know, we want everything that Adam Lane could have had in his possession at the time of the murder. We wanted to know where was the truck and we learned that the truck had already been released. @!DETECTIVE-GEORGE-T : We had Adam Leroy Lanes tractor-trailer for approximately three weeks. Legally, we were only able to obtain evidence that pertained to our case. At that point in time, we did nt have any other cases. So, unfortunately, after several weeks, the owner of the tractor- trailer was looking for his truck back. Without any other cases, we had to eventually give him his truck back. @!DETECTIVE-SERGEANT : Everything in there that belonged to Adam Lane, the owner of the company threw into a dumpster which was located in the impound yard in Massachusetts, where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick up and empty that dumpster on that very day. We got very lucky. We basically beat the trash hauler to the dumpster. And the dumpster was -- was packed, it was full. We suited up. It took an entire afternoon. We took every piece of debris and trash out of that dumpster. And in that bottom of the dumpster we found basically all of Adam Lanes personal property -- clothing, shoes, socks. Without a doubt every detective there suspected that we were coming across key potential DNA evidence in this case. We couldnt wait to get back to New Jersey, submit this stuff to the forensic laboratory and let the evidence basically show us, you know, what happened. @!DETECTIVE-GEORGE-T : Before Geoff went back, he wanted to interview Adam Leroy Lane. At that point we told him do nt get your hopes up but its worth a shot. @!DETECTIVE-SERGEANT : Going into the interview with Adam Lane, we had basically very low expectations. Because he did nt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wasnt going to speak to us. Hello, sir. My name is Geoffrey. Geoffrey Noble. How nice to meet you. @!DETECTIVE-GEORGE-T : After Detective Noble went in to interview Adam Lane, my sergeant and I waited for him. We were thinking we were going to be eating dinner shortly. Its probably not going to go very long. After about a half hour, forty-five minutes, we realized, he s talking. After an hour we decided, you know what, we better go eat without him. @!DETECTIVE-SERGEANT : As we started talking to him, it became evident that Adam Lane actually, much to our surprise, wanted to speak with us. qwq @( Interrogation-vide : How long have you been driving trucks? @!ADAM-LEROY-LANE-@1 : On and off, twenty years. @!DETECTIVE-SERGEANT : For the first hour, hour-and-a-half of the interview, he never once asked us what crime we were investigating. And my impression of that is he did nt need to ask because he knew why we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!ADAM-LEROY-LANE-@1 : They took movies that I had in the truck and made it seem like I was the worst mass murderer you ever seen in your life. Just because I hor -- like horror movies. @!DETECTIVE-SERGEANT : We did not have the benefit of the forensic results. So this whole interview was -- was done basically with my partner and I just feeling out Adam Lane as we went. qwq @( Interrogation-vide : Did you go anywhere else? @!ADAM-LEROY-LANE-@1 : No. @!DETECTIVE-SERGEANT( interrogation video) : Did you -- did you -- We told him were not here because we think you did something in New Jersey. I told him were here because we know you did something in New Jersey. And you could see Adam Lanes demeanor start to change and my impression of it was he was starting to come to the realization that he was caught. And after several seconds he said the words Im done. I packed up our stuff. We turned off the tape recorder. My partner and I got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And after several minutes Adam Lane made a motion through the window of the door, made a nod for us to come back in. And at that point we -- we knew exactly where we were. We knew that Adam Lane wanted to confess. @!ADAM-LEROY-LANE-@1 : This is going to kill my family. @!DETECTIVE-SERGEANT : That he wanted to tell us what happened that night. @!ADAM-LEROY-LANE-@1 : She sit straight up and got out of bed when she seen me and started screaming and I tried to get her to be quiet. @!DETECTIVE-SERGEANT : He described how he stabbed Monica. @!ADAM-LEROY-LANE-@1 : I had the knife, it was on the bed, it was about that long. She split -- rolled against it and cut right here. Best I could tell, and Im no medic, it cut this jugular vein right here. @!MAN-@1interrogatio : How far across? @!ADAM-LEROY-LANE-@1 : About here. @!DETECTIVE-SERGEANT : He described where he stabbed her. @!ADAM-LEROY-LANE-@1 : Between her legs. On her stomach.. @!DETECTIVE-SERGEANT( interrogation video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this? @!ADAM-LEROY-LANE-@1 : No. @!DETECTIVE-SERGEANT( interrogation video) : Did you -- @!ADAM-LEROY-LANE-@1 : Look, I love my wife. I love my wife very much. I ai nt out for sexual toys. @!DETECTIVE-SERGEANT( interrogation video) : What happened next, Adam? @!ADAM-LEROY-LANE-@1 : She bled to death. I couldnt do nothing about it. It did nt take very long. @!DETECTIVE-SERGEANT( interrogation video) : About how long? @!ADAM-LEROY-LANE-@1 : Less than sixty seconds. @!DETECTIVE-SERGEANT : Adam Lane no doubt about it is perhaps the most dangerous man that Ive seen personally. And the reason is because, you know, theres no explanation. There is no why with Adam Lane. And he killed Monica Massaro just in my opinion for the sport of it. @!JEANNIE-MCDONOUGH : I received a phone call on my cell phone from the chief of police. They told us that Adam Leroy Lane had murdered a woman the night before he came to our house. When we heard that, we -- we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment that we came seconds, milliseconds from losing our daughter in the most horrific way possible. @(Graphics-on-screen) @!NICOLE-POGASIC : My biggest fear after I lost my mom was that I was going to lose my dad. I did nt want him to end up in prison for something that he did nt do. Emotionally, I couldnt bear to lose another parent. @!TODD-EWALT : I had been subpoenaed to appear in front of a grand jury the early part of September of 2007. And as it drew closer, the more worried I was getting. @!DETECTIVE-SERGEANT : Several weeks after we submitted Adam Lanes knives to our laboratory for analysis, we received word of what the results were. The results showed that not only was Monica Massaros DNA on his knives, but also Darlene Ewalts from Pennsylvania. Her DNA was also on Adam Lanes knives. @!NICOLE-POGASIC : I found out that my moms DNA was on a knife from the newspaper. I think I called my Dad. Im like so youre clear? And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing that finally that they have the evidence to clear my father. @!ED-MARSICO-JR. : After we discovered that Darlenes blood was on the knife taken from Adam Lane, I did meet with Todd Ewalt and explained to him that we had found the perpetrator and apologized that he had been a suspect, treated as he believed somewhat unfairly during the investigative process. And I wanted him to know that we would do whatever we could to bring Adam Lane to justice. @!TODD-EWALT : I cant even begin to think of how bad it would have been if Lane was never caught. I think I would have been on trial for the murder of my wife. @!ED-MARSICO-JR. : The DNA match of Darlene Ewalts blood on Adam Leroy Lanes knife was a complete game changer. We knew that he was incarcerated, that he faced charges in Massachusetts and he faced charges in New Jersey. Since he was locked up, and we knew he wasnt going anywhere, we decided we would defer to Massachusetts and New Jersey before commencing our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrified me, I wanted to face this guy down. I -- Im sorry but you do nt come into my house and attack my family. Im going to be there. And Im going to watch you every step of the way. @(Graphics-on-screen) @!KERRY-AHERN : We knew pretty much from the outset that this case was not going to go to trial. There was really no defense that he had to offer. He was caught red-handed in the McDonoughs house by the Chelmsford police. So at some level we knew it was going to be a plea. And what it came down to was how long of a sentence were we going to get on this guy. The one sticking point for Adam Lane seems to be the sexual assault charge. He was adamant that he wasnt going to sexually assault Shea McDonough. This wasnt about sex. So I went to the McDonoughs and we discussed it if that was the one sticking point, did they feel comfortable with dismissing that charge if it meant that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would receive twenty-five to thirty years in state prison. @!JEANNIE-MCDONOUGH : That meant that Shea would not have to get up on the witness stand and recount everything that she went through that night and just traumatize her all over again. We said, okay, lets just accept the plea bargain and go forward with it. @!KERRY-AHERN : I would have liked to seen a longer sentence since thats what we were advocating for. But we also knew that Adam was going to face murder charges in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania. So at the end of the day, we knew he was never going to get out. @!JEANNIE-MCDONOUGH : I felt compelled that, okay, even though the legal battles for us were over, I was going to see this thing through and I was going to make sure that I was at every hearing that he was at, that I was with the families of the other victims. @!JEANNIE-MCDONOUGH : We went down to the sentencing for Monica Massaro. @!MAN-# 1( in court) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. We do nt know why a person who has a husband and a father suddenly commits these kind of acts. @!JEANNIE-MCDONOUGH : I just was heartbroken for Faye and Frank Massaro. Monica was their only child and only daughter. And their whole lives revolved around her. @!SHEA-MCDONOUGH : I remember giving Monicas mom a hug and just saying how sorry I was and just really feeling her pain. And it -- it was hard. It was really hard. @!JEANNIE-MCDONOUGH : As we were walking into the courtroom, we noticed this gentleman sitting against a railing outside of the courthouse. And he just looked lost. We learned that it was Todd Ewalt, the husband of Darlene Ewalt. I gave him a big hug. And I just felt like awful. Why am I here and his wife isnt here? @!TODD-EWALT : I was just really thankful to meet them the first time, to be able to shake their hand and tell them thank you. @!JEANNIE-MCDONOUGH : For them to finally have their daughters killer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was relieved that they were able to be there and see him sentenced. @!MAN-# 2( in court) : -- sentenced to serve fifty years in the New Jersey State Prison. @!JEANNIE-MCDONOUGH : I wanted to know why Lane would go off and start killing people. I started digging, looking for answers. It just snowballed and it ended up turning into a book. It seems like he had a normal childhood and as far as we could see that there was no criminal background. The police told me that it was very difficult on his family. Well never probably ever know why he did what he did. There was more to write about because Lane still had to face the charges against Darlene Ewalt and I was determined that I was going to be in that courtroom when he was sentenced. I could be there as a reminder to him that you know what, you killed those other women, but Im still here and Im going to make sure you get what you deserve. @(Graphics-on-screen) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Lane was sentenced for the murder of my mother. The McDonoughs were there and the Massaros were there. @!JEANNIE-MCDONOUGH : It showed a lot of solidarity between the families, the connection that we all feel as a result of being tormented by this guy. @!NICOLE-POGASIC : There was some tension in the courtroom. But there was also a lot of tears and pain. And then there was just nothing from Lane. He was a blank slate. Its like he did nt even care. @!ED-MARSICO-JR : We initially sought the death penalty against Mister Lane. As we continued to talk with the Ewalt family, they were becoming concerned about an actual trial, you know, going through the emotional aspects of hearing about Darlenes death in a trial, the fact that a defense tactic might be to try and blame Todd as -- as the killer. @!MAN-# 3( news reporter) : A serial killer who police say went after random women along his truck route will spend the rest of his life behind bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Some of Ewalts family were in courtroom today and they supported the agreement. @!TODD-EWALT : It was not hard to accept a plea deal for life in prison for Adam Lane. Because whether he s on death row or not, its not going to change my circumstances at all because nothing can make up for all the pain that he s caused. Theres just no way. @!JEANNIE-MCDONOUGH : I feel like if theres anything I can do for Nicole to make the road ahead easier for her I owe it to her. @!NICOLE-POGASIC : I can call Jeannie anytime. Shes programmed in my speed dial. And usually at the end of every phone call it ends with I love you. Its great because its almost like a second mother. The McDonoughs are sort of like heroes in my book. They stopped an innocent man from going to jail. They put a guilty man away. And they saved countless women. @!SHEA-MCDONOUGH : Its hard looking at the other families and seeing that the hard times that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and I do feel guilty that Im still here and that others are nt because it sucks. @!JEANNIE-MCDONOUGH : She just was traumatized. She did nt want to get up out of bed. She did nt want to leave her room. When she was in the basement, she was terrified of people looking in. @!KEVIN-MCDONOUGH : She had gone off to school. And she had some anxiety. She thought she was ready to go on to college and she -- she had to come home. She -- she couldnt be away from us initially. @!SHEA-MCDONOUGH : Therapy made a huge difference and I was able to just get a lot of emotions and feelings out that I did nt even know, like, I had built up. And it was just a great feeling because now I feel like Im able to let go and able to move on without holding a grudge and being angry. @!SHEA-MCDONOUGH : Every time I leave the house or every time I go anywhere, its -- we never forget to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen.
