247541 ALEX CHADWICK, Host : This is Weekend Edition. I 'm Alex Chadwick. Yellowstone is the first and best known of America 's national parks, and the image that comes to most people 's minds, when they think of Yellowstone, is, of course, an erupting Old Faithful, the world 's most reliable geyser. This month, the House of Representatives is considering the Old Faithful Protection Act, designed to preserve the famous landmark and other geothermal features. Many people believe that drilling for hot water and, to a lesser extent, oil and gas, even outside the park, could someday destroy Old Faithful. Reporter Jim Robbins traveled to Yellowstone for a firsthand look at the park 's geothermal system. Sound of tourists congregating to watch Old Faithful JIM ROBBINS, Reporter : It 's the Old Faithful waiting game. On a sunny day in June, a crowd is assembled on a giant boardwalk in the mountains of Wyoming. Once every 70 minutes or so, the geyser erupts and another throng of tourists gets its money 's worth. Sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Underground water begins to splash out of a hole and over the sides, building momentum. Then it shoots up in a narrow stream. Before long, a column of water, veiled in steam, is roaring 180 feet above the earth into the clouds. Tourists clap, shout, cheer as they watch geyser erupt ROBBINS : Every year, some three million people from around the globe come to Yellowstone National Park to see this spectacle. BETTY CHAMPION, Tourist : I 'm Betty Champion sp from Florence, Alabama. JACK CHAMPION, Tourist : And I 'm Jack Champion sp from Florence, Alabama. POLLY TORRANCE, Tourist : I 'm Polly Torrance sp from Demopolis, Alabama. POOKIE TORRANCE, Tourist : I 'm Pookie Torrance sp from Demopolis, Alabama @!ROBBINS For these folks, Old Faithful did n't disappoint. MALE TOURIST : We thought it beat Halley 's Comet they laugh, but not by a lot. FEMALE TOURIST : To tell you the truth, the comet unintelligible, but we had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the pictures. So we were n't disappointed at all, you know. SAME MALE TOURIST : And it went off just about when they said it was going to. They said 2:32, and it went off about 2:35, so that 's pretty close @!ROBBINS But Old Faithful is only one of hundreds of geysers in Yellowstone, and for a small group of aficionados, who take their geothermal observing very seriously, the world 's best known geyser is, well, kind of boring @!FEMALE People like- uh, it 's a very pretty geyser, it really is. But it's- most of the time in the summer there 's so many people around that you just ca n't stand to be there @!MALE Part of the fun that we get from watching geysers is seeing the differences in their eruptions and activity in relationships with other geysers. Old Faithful was a very, as geysers go, it 's very simple and very straightforward, and its eruptions generally look very much the same from eruption to eruption @!FEMALE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem them one sic, you 've seen them all @!ROBBINS For several hundred people, the geysers of Yellowstone Park are something to die for. These ' geyser gazers, ' as they 're known, spend weeks and months watching the park 's 300 or so erupting features, sometimes around the clock. They have insignias, a newsletter, even their own lingo @!MALE It was a Grand Canyon-induced, poopout, double washout, followed by a triple pause @!ROBBINS That means it was a good eruption. GORDON BRAUER : It was a group of three ten-oh-six, ten-nineteen, and ten-thirty-six yesterday, and then again at- ROBBINS : Gordon Brauer sp is a geyser gazer from Idaho Falls, Idaho, and a devoted member of the Geyser Observation and Study Association. He can be found in Yellowstone much of the summer, jotting down notes about eruptions in his yellow ledger book. Tomorrow, Gordon, who said he was memorizing eruption tables before he could read, will celebrate his 18th birthday right here, among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunrise ' til sunset out in the geyser basins, writing down when geysers erupt, how high they go, how long the eruptions last. I spend a fair portion of my fall and winter doing statistical analysis of the geyser data, trying to find patterns in it, better ways to predict it, determining what underground connections exist between geysers. I have yet to be in the park when an earthquake occurs, but I 'm looking forward to having that happen sometime @!ROBBINS The love of geysers must run in the blood. The parents of these kids are also in Yellowstone. They know the names and personalities of each of the spouting landmarks, and they make no bones about the fact that watching hot water erupt into the air for several weeks each summer is a bit of an obsession. MALE PARENT : If you 're the kind of person to have obsessions, I guess this is a good one @!ROBBINS What 's a grand slam for your folks? FEMALE PARENT : Unintelligible and mortar- MALE PARENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Castle, probably @!MALE -Castle. Yeah, and if you- right- and if you drive down to Great Fountain and have a sunset superburst, that would be it. Sound of birds chirping and water bubbling ROBBINS : The Yellowstone Geyser Basins are a landscape in flux, and that 's part of the fascination. These formations throw open a window on geological processes that might otherwise take place over millions of years. John Barley sp, director of research in Yellowstone, stands before a steaming, opalescent spring that only recently came to life. JOHN BARLEY, Director of Research, Yellowstone : When people think of geology, they think of things that happened a million years ago or 10 million years ago, and one of the exciting things about Yellowstone is you 're watching geology in action. The spring that we 're standing by was dead last year and now this year it has reactivated itself and looks vibrant and alive. And the stone that 's being formed as a result of that deposition grows about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's extraordinary @!ROBBINS Despite the intense heat of these pools, there is life inside of them, and many researchers here are studying their microscopic residents. One experiment revolutionized DNA fingerprinting, discovering an organism that rapidly replicates DNA molecules. Fingerprinting is a method of identifying people by their genetic code. The view from the surface at Yellowstone is only part of the story. The engine that drives the steamy display is hidden underground, says Wayne Hamilton sp, a research geologist at the park. WAYNE HAMILTON, Research Geologist, Yellowstone : Yellowstone is the largest active volcanic caldera in the western hemisphere, and it last erupted violently about 600,000 years ago. I do n't think that very many people realize that the state of Wyoming has a world-class volcano in it @!ROBBINS A caldera is an underground volcano, and here in Yellowstone, the magma in the volcano comes very close to the surface. Mr. HAMILTON : The northern half of Yellowstone Lake rests on the caldera, and if you get out of your car, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along in the beach sands there, you 're likely to get your feet burned. Sound of the two men walking ROBBINS : See where these tendrils of steam are here? I think it 's probably too hot for me to walk on it ; if I get close, I 'll let you know. Ouch! Yes, it 's hot. Besides hot beaches and geysers, the giant caldera creates other steamy pathways. Sometimes it sounds like the earth is eerily alive and straining to speak or perhaps sing, a ghostly sounding geyser choir. Sound of spouting water of a geyser ROBBINS : There are mud pots, holes in the ground filled with boiling gray or brown muck. Sound of mud pots bubbling, much like the sound of oatmeal bubbling ROBBINS : And steam vents that pack the roar of a jet engine. Sound of a roaring steam vent ROBBINS : Norris sp Geyser Basin, a valley filled with bubbling hot springs and the sulfury stink of sulfur is the hottest place in the park. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise around stark white trees, killed by chemicals in the boiling water. Orange and red algae grow around the pools. Geyser basins like this are unstable and can be treacherous. Occasionally people wander off the boardwalks, fall through the crust and are scalded to death. Hot springs and geysers may be dangerous, but they are fragile as well. And they have been abused over the years. In the early days of the park, visitors sometimes jammed dirty laundry into Old Faithful and then collected their steam-cleaned clothes, scattered all over the place. And the park officials often poured soap into geysers to get them to spout off for visiting dignitaries. Today, scientists realize that any tampering with a geyser or a hot pool can destroy. Sound of clanging pot or equipment RICK HUTCHINSON, Ranger : You see what I 'm trying to get is those rocks right over there @!ROBBINS Ranger Rick Hutchinson sp is the caretaker of the geothermals near Old Faithful. On this morning he 's floating in an unsinkable boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is Morning Glory pool, one of the best known landmarks in the park, and a place tourists just ca n't resist tossing in a coin or a rock. Mr. HUTCHINSON : All 's you do is unintelligible hot rod there @!ROBBINS Hutchinson maneuvers a 12-foot aluminum pole with two metal fingers on the end. Besides the usual, rangers have fished from these pools underwear, jewelry, bones, even a runaway snowmobile. Mr. HUTCHINSON : This is a nonrenewable resource, and all 's it takes is just a small rock or a log jammed down a vent to permanently destroy a hot spring or geyser. You know, people think just one little coin or one little rock wo n't hurt, but you know, everything adds up @!ROBBINS But the greatest threat to the integrity of Yellowstone 's geothermal features lies outside the park. There people want to drill into the underground hot water network, a system scientists say is connected to Yellowstone. The steam and water could be used for heat and power. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being drawn up, no one realized Yellowstone 's geothermal landscape relied on such an extensive, underground plumbing system. And it 's not just the hot pools and geysers that are being encroached upon ; Yellowstone is too small for the wildlife that lives there. Grizzly bears, elk and bison all need a habitat that extends beyond the park 's borders, and confrontations with humans are increasing. Experts agree Yellowstone can not survive as an island. Just to the north of the park, a controversial religious sect, called the Church Universal and Triumphant, has drilled one small well for hot water. Montana congressman Pat Williams sp has introduced a bill that would prevent the church and others, including commercial power companies, from tapping into the system near the park. PAT WILLIAMS, Montana Congressman : They want the hot water for a gigantic hot tub for the members of their church, and so what we have here is the geothermal features of America 's first national park pitted against the hot tub needs of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run roughshod over the rights of this church? No. But should we protect Yellowstone at all costs? Absolutely. ED FRANCIS, Vice President and Business Manager, Church Universal and Triumphant : The issue of a four-gallon-per minute well has certainly been exaggerated way out of all perspective, and perhaps the fact that we are the Church Universal and Triumphant is a factor here, because there are two other wells in the area -- one of which is owned by a Yellowstone park ranger -- which have not become an issue at all @!ROBBINS Ed Francis is vice president and business manager of the Church Universal and Triumphant. He says their thermal pool will be used for medicinal purposes and that any pumping would be kept to a minimum. Mr. FRANCIS : If we thought for a minute that any use of our spring or well would impact Yellowstone Park, we would be more than happy to relinquish its use and would, in fact, give it over to the state or federal government. But the overwhelming body of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of geyser ROBBINS : Battling the church and others who would like to develop geothermal activity on the park 's borders is the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, an environmental group. Louisa Wilcox sp is the program director for the GYC. She says a small well like the church 's does pose a danger, but the real threat to Yellowstone 's geothermals would come form commercial power development. LOUISA WILCOX, Program Director, Greater Yellowstone Coalition : That is the killer of geysers. Since the 1950s, eight out of the 10 world 's geyser systems have been damaged or destroyed by geothermal power development. And in one case, and it 's a very tragic case in Nevada at Beowawe, the power companies never got to the point even of developing the power resource. Four exploratory holes basically killed the Beowawe geyser system, which was second in the U.S. only to Yellowstone. Four holes ; it took 13 hours, and this thing was dead. And once you kill these things, you can not reconstruct the underground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take such a risk with Yellowstone Park? Sound of tourists cheering at geyser eruption ROBBINS : The geysers of Yellowstone are a symbol for problems facing parks throughout the United States. When these areas were created, the science of ecology was unheard of, and now researchers know many parts are missing vital pieces. More than a century after Congress thought this wilderness was protected once and for all, the fate of Yellowstone 's fantastic array of geysers, hot pools, and steam vents is still up in the air. Sound of tourists leaving after geyser finishes eruption ROBBINS : This is Jim Robbins reporting. to the accuracy of speakers ' words or spelling.
