5002441 @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Good morning to you. And welcome to CBS THIS MORNING. I 'm Gayle King, with Anthony Mason and Tony Dokoupil. Democrats divide. Joe Biden comes out swinging against his progressive rivals at a fiery debate where health care, gun control, and President Trump dominate the discussion. @1ANTHONY-MASON@2 : Recovery at risk? A new storm threatens the already hurricane-devastated Bahamas. We 're with the former Navy SEALs taking supplies to Dorian survivors who say their government is missing in action. @1TONY-DOKOUPIL@2 : Genetic testing scam. A CBS News investigation uncovers laboratories charging Medicare millions for unnecessary cancer tests. Jim Axelrod tracked down one of the doctors two helps them do it. And a true veteran. Lawrence Brooks is the oldest living American to serve in World War II. We take you to his one hundred and tenth birthday party. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Happy Birthday, Mister Brooks. It 's Friday, September 13, 2019. Here 's this morning 's Eye Opener -- your world in ninety seconds. @1JULIAN-CASTRO@2 : You just said two minutes ago that they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy in. @1JOE-BIDEN@2 : They would not have to buy in. If you qualified for Medicaid they would automatically be -- @1JULIAN-CASTRO@2 : Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? @1ANTHONY-MASON@2 : Sparks fly at the third Democratic debate. @1ANDREW-YANG@2 : Come on, guys. Come on. @1PETE-BUTTIGIEG@2 : This is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable. @1SENATOR-KAMALA-HARRI@3 : Yeah. @1PETE-BUTTIGIEG@2 : This reminds everybody of what they can not stand about Washington -- scoring points against each other, poking at each other. MAN #1 : In the Bahamas, a new tropical storm warning is in effect after Hurricane Dorian devastated the area with so many still missing. ANNE-MARIE GREEN : Former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe is facing indictment. MAN #2 : The Justice Department rejected McCabe 's appeal against criminal charges. MAN #3 : President Trump denying claims made in a new Politico report accusing Israeli agents of planting spy devices near the White House. @1PRESIDENT-DONALD-TRU@3 : I do n't think the Israelis were spying on us. WOMAN #1 : Actress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleading guilty for her role in that massive college cheating scandal. WOMAN #2 : A bench warrant was issued for singer R. Kelly after he failed to appear at a court hearing in Minnesota. @1ANTHONY-MASON@2 : All that -- MAN #4 : Four down and half a yard. McCaffrey did not get it. Tampa Bay is going to win this game. WOMAN #3 : A parasailing prank is going viral. That water is filled with jellyfish. MAN #5( internet video) : Oh, no, no, no. @1ANTHONY-MASON@2 : -- and all that matters -- @1ANDREW-YANG@2 : I 'm going to do something unprecedented tonight. My campaign will now give a freedom dividend of one thousand dollars a month for an entire year to ten American families. @1TREVOR-NOAH@2 @5Comedy-Central@6 : Oh, look, an Asian Oprah over here. He 's giving everybody money. @1ANTHONY-MASON@2 : -- on CBS THIS MORNING. @1JOE-BIDEN@2 : Let me tell you what I think. I think we should have a debate on health care. I think -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Well, I 'm for Barack. @1STEPHEN-COLBERT@2 @5Late-Show-with-Steph@7 : He mentioned Obama. For those playing at home, time to take a drink. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : I think it 's great they go live right after the debates because there 's a lot of material -- @1ANTHONY-MASON@2 : There is a lot to talk about. Three -- @1GAYLE-KING@2 : -- to talk about. @1ANTHONY-MASON@2 : -- three hours produces a lot of material. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : You know that Asian Oprah line was kind of funny. @1ANTHONY-MASON@2 : It was pretty good. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Trevor, only you could say that. Welcome to CBS THIS MORNING. We 're going to begin with the latest Democratic debate where ten presidential candidates showed a clear divide between the parties ' political center and its left wing. It was the first time that all the top Democrats in this race appeared together. They displayed sharp divisions on a range of issues including health care. @1TONY-DOKOUPIL@2 : And in a first there were three women, two African- Americans, one Latino, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be the next president. Ed O'Keefe is in Houston where he covered the debate last night. Ed, good morning. Who set themselves apart, and how did they do it? @1ED-O'KEEFE@2 @5CBS-News-Political-C@7 : Well, Tony, the differences last night were pretty clear on some issues. Over the course of nearly three hours, perhaps the differences most stark between those right at center stage. The national frontrunner, Joe Biden, a moderate, sandwiched between two liberals -- Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. @5Begin-VT@6 @5Julian-Castro-speaki@7 @1SENATOR-AMY-KLOBUCHA-@3 @5Houston-Last-Night ; -@7 : Houston, we have a problem. @1ED-O'KEEFE@2 : A battle of the big ten Democrats in Houston focused especially on the top issue of concern -- health care and how to pay for it. @1SENATOR-ELIZABETH-WA-@3 @5D-Presidential-Candi@7 : Costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals, and costs are going to go up for giant corporations. @1ED-O'KEEFE@2 : Former Vice President Joe Biden and other moderates repeatedly pressed Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders for how they would pay for their Medicare for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks that the employers going to give you back if you negotiate as union all these years, got a cut in wages because you got insurance. They 're going to give back that money to the employee? @1SENATOR-BERNIE-SANDE-@3 @5D-Presidential-Candi@7 : As a matter of fact, they will, in our bill. @1JOE-BIDEN@2 : Well, let me tell you something. For a socialist, you got a -- for a socialist, you got a lot more confidence in corporate America than I do. @1PETE-BUTTIGIEG@2 @5D-Presidential-Candi@7 : I trust you to choose what makes the most sense for you -- not my way or the highway. @1ANDREW-YANG@2 @5D-Presidential-Candi@7 : I am Asian so, I know a lot of doctors, and they tell me that they spend a lot of time on paperwork, avoiding being sued, and navigating the insurance bureaucracy. @1ED-O'KEEFE@2 : The most combative moment of the night, when former Housing Secretary Julian Castro accused Biden of flip-flopping on whether people who ca n't afford health care would be automatically enrolled in Biden 's health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy in. They do not have to buy in. @1JULIAN-CASTRO@2 @5D-Presidential-Candi@7 : Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? @1JOE-BIDEN@2 : -- automatically be enforced. @1JULIAN-CASTRO@2 : Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago? I mean I ca n't believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in, and now you 're saying they do n't have to buy -- you 're forgetting that. @1ED-O'KEEFE@2 : The three-hour debate at Texas Southern University, a historically black university, included calls for stricter gun control in the wake of two recent mass shootings in the state. @1SENATOR-CORY-BOOKER@2 @5D-Presidential-Candi@7 : Background checks and gun licensing, these are agreed to by overwhelmingly the majority of Americans. @1SENATOR-KAMALA-HARRI-@3 @5D-Presidential-Candi@7 : It is traumatizing our children. El Paso -- and Beto, God love you for standing so courageously in the midst of that tragedy. @1BETO-O'ROURKE@2 @5D-Presidential-Candi@7 : I met the mother of a fifteen-year-old girl who was shot by an AR-15, and that mother watched her bleed to death over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot by the AR-15 in Odessa and Midland, there were n't enough ambulances to get to them in time. Hell yes, we 're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47. We 're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore. @5Crowd-cheering@6 @5End-VT@6 @1ED-O'KEEFE@2 : So, we caught up with Julian Castro after the debate to ask him what exactly he was trying to do there, his attacks on Biden. As you can see, we literally went over the transcript with him about what was said between him and the vice president. He insists that this was an issue over health care policy, not over the former vice president 's age or agility. Some we spoke to after said it was out of bounds. Others said he said what needed to be said. This much we know -- in previous debates, lesser known candidates who went after Biden eventually lost their support and are no longer in the race. Tony. @1TONY-DOKOUPIL@2 : All right. Big lesson there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett. He 's with us at the table. Major. @1MAJOR-GARRETT@2 @5CBS-News-Chief-Washi@7 : Good morning, everybody. @1TONY-DOKOUPIL@2 : Welcome. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Good morning. @1TONY-DOKOUPIL@2 : We had Biden, we had Warren, we had Sanders on the same stage for the first time. @1MAJOR-GARRETT@2 : Yeah. @1TONY-DOKOUPIL@2 : How did they fare? @1MAJOR-GARRETT@2 : So at the debates, three times now, the Biden campaign has never made the case that he was the clear winner of any of the three debates. What does this tell us? He 's playing a game of survivor. Does n't need to win, just survive. Maybe pass/fail is a way to think about this in an academic sense. And what do we see about Warren and Sanders? The nonaggression pact we 've talked about here before continues. Why? Keep the progressive lane wide. It 's not time yet to start going at each other. @1TONY-DOKOUPIL@2 : It ca n't last forever, can it? @1MAJOR-GARRETT@2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @1MAJOR-GARRETT@2 : But those three more or less co-existed at the top. Other thing to observe -- the others, Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, kama -- Kamala Harris -- @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Yeah. @1MAJOR-GARRETT@2 : -- all wanted to be sunny unifying alternatives. @1ANTHONY-MASON@2 : Mm. @1MAJOR-GARRETT@2 : Unity. Why did they want to do that strategically? Because they know someday the Biden-Sanders-Warren clash is coming -- @1ANTHONY-MASON@2 : Right. @1MAJOR-GARRETT@2 : -- and they want to be coming right in behind that to position themselves for the clash to come. And -- @1ANTHONY-MASON@2 : What did you make -- sorry. @1MAJOR-GARRETT@2 : -- geographically, Amy Klobuchar, because she 's from Minnesota near Iowa -- @1ANTHONY-MASON@2 : Yeah. @1MAJOR-GARRETT@2 : -- is best positioned to have a moment as that alternative once that clash comes. @1ANTHONY-MASON@2 : What did you make of Castro 's attack on -- on Biden, as Ed pointed out? @1MAJOR-GARRETT@2 : So, the reaction in the room suggested something that is already on the minds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Is Joe Biden, the former vice president up to this? The gasp was a reflection of the tension. Did Julian Castro help himself? Probably not. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Mm-Hm. @1MAJOR-GARRETT@2 : Because again, the sunny alternative is the place to be, not the pound on Joe Biden as the age -- @1ANTHONY-MASON@2 : It may have been viewed as a low blow. @1MAJOR-GARRETT@2 : -- limited Democratic candidate. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : You have figure out a way to -- @1MAJOR-GARRETT@2 : Because there are other ways to do that. You could say -- @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Yeah. You can -- @1MAJOR-GARRETT@2 : -- you might have misremembered, I do n't want to -- @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Exactly. @1ANTHONY-MASON@2 : Right. @1MAJOR-GARRETT@2 : -- assume things. I do n't want to assume the worst. He assumed the worst -- @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Yeah. @1TONY-DOKOUPIL@2 : Yeah. @1MAJOR-GARRETT@2 : -- about the former vice president. That puts him in an awkward position. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : Got to figure out a way to attack it seems in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that as a personal, as you said, Anthony, low blow. What about Beto O'Rourke 's comment about guns, where he said hell yes we 're going to take your AK-47s. Great reaction in the room. @1MAJOR-GARRETT@2 : Sure. @1GAYLE-KING@2 : How do you think it plays around the country? @1MAJOR-GARRETT@2 : Constitutionally problematic, legislatively almost impossible. But one thing I think you can fairly say about Beto O'Rourke, he 's been transformed by a horrible event during this campaign in real time. All of that, I was born to this Vanity Fair wanderlust about his campaign, that 's gone. He 's a candidate of conviction on a real time issue, and he looked much more serious and focused about what this is for him, not saying he 's going to win or even get in the top tier, but he looks and sounds like a fundamentally different candidate transformed by a horror in his hometown. When you talk about authenticity, as terrible as it was to achieve it -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer to it than he 's been before. @1ANTHONY-MASON@2 : All right, Major Garrett. Thank you, Major. Former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe could be close to facing criminal charges of lying to federal investigators. The Justice Department has rejected a request from McCabe 's lawyers not to indict him in connection with a leak of information to a reporter in 2016. A CBS News source says prosecutors recommend McCabe be indicted. In a CBS THIS MORNING interview in March, he denied deliberately misleading investigators. President Trump has repeatedly criticized McCabe. McCabe 's lawyers say any prosecution would be politically motivated.
