And then I go to my stash, and then I figure out what I have n't done and then... qwq @( Graphic-on-screen, @(Graphic-on-screen) America Held Hostage 331-Middle Class 350-Rich &amp; Dead 1,129-Days Remaining @!ANNOUNCER : Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Rush Limbaugh. @(Theme-music-and-ap) @!RUSH-LIMBAUGH : Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. @(Limbaugh-motions-a) @!LIMBAUGH : Thank you. Ju -- thank you. Thank you, that 's good. Thank you. Thank you so -- thank you. Thank you so much. Oh, I got caught hyping the audience, Dick. @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : Remember to edit that out of the show for broadcast. @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : Of course, we ca n't edit it out of the show for broadcast since I just gave away the fact that it 's in the broadcast. Anyway, welcome to an exciting edition of @!RUSH-LIMBAUGH, the television show. I have to tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner party here in New York City. Now -- second of two in a row that I have been asked to. And whenever -- you 've got to understand something. New York is a very, very liberal community, as is New Jersey. @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : And -- see, I 've already won because she 's smiling now and she 's not... @(Camera-on-an-audie) @!LIMBAUGH : She 's our liberal in the audience tonight, ladies and gentlemen. Oh, I love it. I do. When I get invited to a party in New York, it 's as a circus act. A bunch of liberals in New York throw a dinner party and say, Who can we come -- have come here and entertain us? ' They say, Let 's call Limbaugh? He 's a... ' @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : So, you know, these things do n't go to my head. Let me tell you who was at this party last night. Barbara Walters was at this party ; Liz Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ephron, who -- who is a writer -- screenwriter and director was at this movi -- or at this party ; and a bunch of others too. And -- and -- so at the end of the dinner party, everybody stood around singing Christmas carols, and it was really nice. The fire was raging, and the candles were soft, and they had all those nice Christmas scents -- the aromas -- and it was just a beautiful place. And all of a sudden, after the Christmas carols, the hostess of the party said, OK, now let 's have some people lead us in song. ' So Nora Ephron got up and sang a song and -- and so forth. Then I knew -- I just knew when I 'm standing there that I 'm going to be the one. So they said, Rush ' -- because remember now, I 'm there to be the circus act for a bunch of New York liberals -- it 's... @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : Rush, why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said, No, no, no, no. I -- I really ' -- I said, I -- I do n't -- I do n't think you want to hear what I would sing. ' Oh, we do. We do. ' @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : And I said, Look, I do n't know Christmas songs other than the ones we 've sung. The only songs I know are political. ' Oh, we would really like to hear one of those. ' @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : So I -- realizing why I was there, kind of just to stir the pot, I said, Well, I -- I can sing you a song. I -- I ca -- I can give you a very operatic rendition of " Ai n't Got No Home. " @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : They said, " Ai n't Got No Home, " what 's that? ' Oh, I said, Oh, that 's Clarence " Frogman " Henry from 1956. The song has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my radio program. This is a Christmas party, do n't forget. @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : What do you mean -- what do you mean, Rush, homeless update? ' And I said, All right, look, I 'll tell -- you guys do n't want to ' -- Charlie Rose was al -- also there. Come on, Rush. Sing it. ' You know, he 's way off in the corner, and nobody 's going to dare ask Charlie to sing because everybody knows he can't. @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : So he 's safe demanding that I do it. So I -- I finally said, Look, I -- I 'll -- I 'm -- I 'm -- you asked me to do it, I 'm going to do it because I 'm not going to chicken out, but you 're not going to like it. I think homelessness is a fraud. The homeless advocacy is a fraud. Mitch Snyder was a fraud, and this is a song about him. ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine of why I think homelessness is what it is. And I said, " 60 Minutes " even backed me up. Last Sunday night they did a story on how Mitch Snyder 's homeless center in Washington is simply a place where they run drugs and booze. And -- and I said, This -- this -- when Mitch died, I thought that I needed to extend to him our deepest sympathies and so I sang an operatic requiem version of my homeless theme. ' Oh, you 've got to do it, Rush. You 've got to do it. ' I said, OK. ' So I 'll give you just a little of it. I 'm not going to... @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : Now imagine this, folks. Imagine the people at this party. You 've got to try to put yourself there. @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : So -- I 've worked hard all my life for this? @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH :( Singing) Ai n't got no home. ' Stunned silence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't got no home. Ai... ' @(Laughter-and-appla) @!LIMBAUGH : Thanks.( Singing) Ai n't got no home. ' @(Echo) @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH :( Singing) Nowhere to roam ' -- because I 'm dead. They all applauded and the party broke up and it was over. @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : It really happened. It really did. I 'll be interested to see if I get invited back next year. @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : Let me show you something. I want to show you something real quickly here. I got -- you know, I went to the White House Christmas party last year when President Bush was president. This year the Clintons, of course, are in there. And they 're passing out a little pamphlet. When you go to the parties, they pass out a pamphlet ex -- it 's like a little Christmas greeting from them to all the guests, and I was faxed a copy of it this morning. And I want you to read along with the third paragraph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go, Chet? Run it up there. @(Graphic-on-screen) The White House Christmas -- -- -- -- - The handmade crafts throughout the White House reflect the warmth, creativity, and cultural traditions of thousands of artisans &amp; schoolchildren, from each of the 57 states, occupied territories and possessions.

No, no, no, no. @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : You 're missing the point. Wait a minute. K -- put it back up there, Chet. @(Above-graphic-re-s) @!LIMBAUGH :( Voiceover)... 57 states, occupied territories and possessions. All of the angels and matur -- natural greenery really make us feel at home. ' Now I do n't know -- well, if you add it up -- you got Guam and the Virgin Islands and American Samoa and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the 50 states, you get 57. But the point is where is the last time you heard the term occupied territories ' used? qwq @( Laughter ; -boos) @!LIMBAUGH : I mean, the United States does n't occupy. We liberate. We go in and we liberate the oppressed from the oppressors. Occupied territories. ' This should be -- I mean, I -- as abundantly clear as anything else is about this administration -- occupied territories is Marxist lingo, ladies and gentlemen. @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : You 're talk about moving into occupying territory. I thought as amazingly illustrative of just who these people are and I wanted to make sure you saw that. Finally -- well, actually not finally, I 've got a lot of stuff to do here. How many of you heard about the -- the Kennedy -- Senator Kennedy Christmas party, where he dressed up as -- he dressed up as Barney? qwq @( Photo-of-Senator-K @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH :( Voiceover) Well -- no, this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and had some kids, and the kids were scared to death when he took the Barney mask off. @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : And the people -- the people that created Barney, they 're not amused. They 're going to file a cease and desist order for copyright violation because he -- Senator Kennedy 's running around saying, They do n't call me tyrannosaurus sex for nothing. ' @(Laughter) @(Above-photo-re-sho) @!LIMBAUGH : No, I -- I 'm not making this up. That 's what he said. Now his -- his wife, the former Victoria Reggie, now Victoria Kennedy, was -- she was -- she was dressed up as a little girl with blond pigtails and so forth. And she was running around singing Barney 's song. I love you. You love me. ' La, la -- whatever. I have never heard the song and I 'm guessing that 's how it goes. @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : And then -- and then she... @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : What... @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : Never heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvising. @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : But she 's walking around -- now this is true. This is absolutely true. She 's walking around at the party describing how the astronauts on the shuttle Endeavour tried to screw new parts into the Hubble telescope and Senator Kennedy said, Floating screw. That 's what people used to call me. ' @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : Right here. If you do n't believe me -- I am not making it up. Well, the people at Barney are very upset. This is apparently dirtier and -- and sexier than -- than any previous Kennedy party. And I 'm reading that and I 'm saying, What about Bob Packwood? ' You know there -- nobody is on Senator Kennedy 's case for this. Man, we 're just so over time here. I -- I 've got to tell you, had my pre-interview today for the David Letterman show. The C -- " The Late Show With David Letterman. " I 'm going to be on it. @(Cut-out-of-David-L) @!LIMBAUGH : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets on this show so easily. We have n't even invited him and he shows up. @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : Anyway, now I -- I did the preinterview on -- on Thursday morning. @(Letterman-cut-out-) @!LIMBAUGH : See you, Dave. @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : And I -- I 've been preinterviewed by shows before, and I -- I used to think that they invited you on these show because they like you and they want you to be likable to the audience. And -- and I think that is the case with -- with the Letterman show. But boy, I 've been -- I 've been on -- well, " Later with Bob Costas, " I 've been on the Sajak show and I 've been on a number of shows and they do thes -- " The Today Show. " And they come and they do these preinterviews and -- and every time I 've been preinterviewed -- and that 's basically where you discuss what you 're going to talk about. The segment producer says, What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? What do you like? What is your audience all worked up about? Yada, yada, yada. ' You answer all these questions and then you go on the show and not one question they ask you, or not one subject that is brought up, has anything to do with what the -- what 's in the preinterview. It 's a sandbag. I mean, it 's -- and what the preinterview is really all about is -- is, What can we find out about this guy that 's going to set him off. What can we find out about this guy that 's going to make him livid so he loses his cool on our show? ' Now this is different. I think this is going to be fun. It 's just Harry Connick Jr. and me. And what 's Harry Connick Jr. going to talk about, except maybe smuggling guns into New York City? @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : Do n't -- ah, look, look, I 'm just -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually a good conservative, who else would have a gun? qwq @( Laughter ; -applause @!LIMBAUGH : Lighten up, lighten up. So it 's going to be fun. I -- I really -- I really hope you 'll watch it, because some of the things we talked about to have fun are some of the things that you have seen and heard discussed. But you 've got to realize there are probably going to be some -- some members -- the Letterman show audience is just a little bit larger than ours. Not very much, actually, and -- and there will be some people that you know -- what 's going to be fun is just watch the audience reaction. I think that 'll be the hoot here. So we 've got to take a quick break here. We 'll come back with health care, back on the front burner. President Clinton with a big conference at the White House today. We 've got to talk about it. We will after this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @(Camera-zooms-in-on) @!LIMBAUGH : All right. Let me just tell you something very quickly. I do n't have time to beat around the bush. The health-care plan as proposed by Mrs. Clinton is socialism. There 's no soft way to peddle it. There is not other way to describe it. The only way it 'll " work " as drawn is if socialism -- now I use " work " in quotes because socialism does n't work -- but the only chance this plan has is if it is under the -- the aegis of socialism. So make no mistake about it. I mean, it 's taking one seventh of the American economy and transferring it to government control. That is socialism. And we 're going to prove it to you in this segment. The president met with some doctors at the White House today. Here 's how he dealt with the socialism accusations that have been leveled at him and his plan. Watch. President BILL CLINTON : One of the congressional opponents of our approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alabama accent and that Arkansas accent, I -- look, we got a doctor from rural Mississippi here and another one from North Carolina. I thought, These people do not look like a bunch of socialists to me. ' @!LIMBAUGH : Well, I do n't know. We did n't actually get a look at them ourselves, but... @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : Look, you ca n't spot a socialist when you see one. He knows that. It 's the -- what he 's trying to say is, Hey, these doctors here from these great Southern states ' -- there 's a little implied. Those guys with the pickup trucks with the gun racks in the back window ; these guys would n't be socialists. So who do you think you are? ' This is socialism and he knows it. And to try to use a bunch of doctors who are scared to death -- that 's why they 're there. Their salaries are going to be capped. Where they can work is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serve ; how much they can charge ; all of that 's going to be -- this -- this is socialism. And the reason why you 've got some doctors there is because they 've either been promised something sweet or they 're scared. Now here is the president again with -- with a little bit more elaboration on some of this health-care stuff. And two things in this clip I want to point out so watch it carefully. Here it is. President CLINTON : More than anything, these leaders and the physicians whom they represent, many of whom are in the audience today, understand the problems of a health-care system in which millions live in fear of losing their coverage while costs keep rising, in which last year over two million Americans did lose their coverage, so that at the latest count we are now up to nearly 39 million Americans... @!LIMBAUGH :( Voiceover) Stop -- stop the tape right there. Stop it right there. @!Pres-CLINTON :... without health insurance. @!LIMBAUGH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it back. A -- 39 million Mi -- Americans do n't have health insurance, up from 37. Thirty-seven was a bogus number. You know what the real number is? It 's six million Americans ; which is not bad, out of 256 million, who ca n't get coverage. The others of the 37 are people who have chosen it, or who move in and out of coverage. And all of a sudden to say that there are now 39 million -- we 've had two million -- you know how these people that fudge numbers anyway. What 's the proof? How do they know two more million do n't have coverage? If they do n't -- you know who it is? The Clinton economic recovery has featured what, my friends? The loss of 600,000 white-collar jobs. You know that the Fortune 500 is laying people off left and right. And when you lose your job, you lose health care. It 's the great Clinton economic recovery : 616,000 jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say those people do n't have health care, fine. It 's because of his economic recovery plan. When we come back, we are going to prove -- I 'm not supposed to point at you. @(Laughter) @!LIMBAUGH : When we come back, we 're going to prove this socialism stuff to you. We 're going to show you the chart that has in it this National Health Board that his -- that his health-care plan establishes. And you 'll see the big bureaucracy that it is, right after this. qwq @( Theme-music-and-ap @(Announcements) @(Theme-music-and-ap) @!LIMBAUGH : All right. Here we are, ladies and gentlemen, at the flow chart that describes the Clinton health-care plan. qwq @( Graphic-on-screen, @!LIMBAUGH : Now the Clinton health-care plan establishes what is called the National Health Board. Seven people appointed by -- and it 's right here. Here 's the executive office of the president. We got a close-up on this? There we go. Here 's the executive office of the president. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. And these people have powers similar to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In fact, more than that. They 're going to create all the alliances. They 're going to set the prices. They 're going to do all that stuff, and they have no accountability. Look at the bureaucracy in -- and state government has less power than these guys or people, whoever they are. We may not even know who they are, given the track record of Mrs. Clinton and her secrecy reports ; all of this Regional Health Alliance, Corporate Health Alliance, Accountable Health Plan, all of these things come underneath the National Health Board. Now would n't -- none of this stuff exists right now. What do you call the creation of all this? This is socialism. This is big government. This is over 250,000 jobs in the first two years being expanded to set rules and set guidelines. Now USA Today ran a great story today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Health Board. And I want to follow -- I want you to follow along with me as we put this on the screen just so you can see it. So you know it 's not me. qwq @( Visual ; -USA-Today, @!LIMBAUGH :( Voiceover) There it is. Proposal adds layer of new bureaucracy.
