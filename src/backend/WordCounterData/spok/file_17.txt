222441 BETCHA! @!MORLEY-SAFER-co-h : Betcha never thought big-time gambling would become not only legal, but respectable ; so respectable that it 's not even called gambling anymore. It 's ' gaming. ' Only a decade ago, if casino gambling, or gaming, was your thing, you had to find your way to Nevada or New Jersey. Today, there are legal casinos in 23 states, many of them owned by corporate giants like ITT and Hilton who rake in more than $ 17 billion a year in profit from the 125 million gamblers who are crowding America 's blackjack and craps tables, roulette wheels and slot machines. And do n't for a moment think there is n't someone, right now, trying to convince someone in your town that what it needs to make ends meet is a casino. @(Footage-of-gaming-) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) When gambling comes a-knocking, it sings a siren song of jobs, tax revenues and family entertainment, an apparent no-lose proposition. Unidentified Man 1 : Seven a winner. Unidentified Woman 1 : Yes! @(Footage-of-Reveren) @!SAFER :( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party. As spokesman for the National Coalition Against Legal Gambling, Grey is out to stop the spread of casinos dead in its tracks. Reverend TOM GREY : They never saw us coming. I mean, they had such a free ride. Governors were cutting ribbons. Bands were playing. Hell, they were moving across America like they were the wave of the future, the force of history. They were inevitable. @(Footage-of-Grey-wi) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) Not anymore. Everywhere he goes, Grey proudly displays a map, showing the election victories his side has won. Over the past two years, 32 states have said no to gambling expansion, and only three have said yes. @!Rev-GREY : And it was n't that we beat them with lawyers, and it was n't we beat them with governors ; we beat them as people, because we said, ' No more. ' Government shortchanges us when they tell us that the only way we can fund something is through gambling. That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as American as apple pie. Why should n't the government take its cut? @!Rev-GREY : Because it compromises the government. Now maybe the Mob 's going to do it, maybe someone else. But to have government enter into the contract is unforgivable to me. @(In-car) It 's a real mission for us. @(Footage-of-Grey-in) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) He 's on the road 280 days a year, warning communities that gambling is not the cure-all it claims to be, that it breeds crime and corruption and addiction, and fails to deliver real prosperity. Unidentified Man 2 :( To Grey) Hello, Tom. @(Footage-of-Grey-wi) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) His pulpit : free time on talk radio. Man 2 :( On radio) JFBK ; we 're talking gambling today. Tom Grey is here. @!Rev-GREY :( On radio) I 'm here to organize and light fires from the bottom up with citizens... @(Footage-of-Grey-at) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) Grey regards this crusade as a personal war. He was once commander of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a Methodist minister, and settled in the little town of Galena, Illinois. But in 1992, the county commissioners invited a riverboat casino to move in, despite the fact that 80 percent of the town rejected it in a non-binding vote. @!Rev-GREY : And they rammed the damn thing in anyway. Now you got me angry. @(Footage-of-riverbo) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) Angry enough to lead a boycott that turned the casino into a floating disaster. Business was so bad that the Illinois Gaming Board did the unthinkable : They closed the boat down because it could n't pay its bills. But just downriver, in Alton, Illinois, business is booming. This riverboat, which started up before Grey got going, is credited with revitalizing a dying community, making Alton a poster town for the gambling industry. And Mayor Don Sandidge says there was absolutely no downside. Mayor DON SANDIDGE( Alton, Illinois) : It 's given us a shot in the arm. It 's given us money to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( Footage-of-Alton ; - @!SAFER :( Voiceover) Alton was nearly bankrupt. Then, through local taxes, the riverboat pumped over $ 32 million into the city treasury, enough to pay for a riverfront marina and build a new firehouse. Unidentified Woman 2 : Hello. Welcome to our...( unintelligible). @(Footage-of-people-) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) Nine hundred people work at the boat, making it the third-largest employer in town. To Alton 's city fathers, economics outweigh any moral reservation. Unidentified Man 3 :( On riverboat) Have a good time, and good luck. qwq @( Footage-of-people- Mayor SANDIDGE :( Voiceover) If people want to gamble, they 're going to gamble. We might as well take advantage of it. @!Rev-GREY : Is this what we 've come to, where we 're going to put a casino and say, ' This is what will entertain you, this is what will bring economic development and this is how we will pay our taxes '? @!SAFER : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a government that cannibalizes its own citizens is a government you 've got to get rid of. It makes losers of people. @(Footage-of-Grey-wi) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) So Grey fights back. Let citizens decide at the ballot box if they want gambling ; like in Pittsburg, California, a town of 50,000 near San Francisco, where the city brass pushed for a casino to be built by a developer, smack in the middle of a suburban community. When the neighborhood called for help, Grey, the ' lone ranger, ' rode to the rescue. @!Rev-GREY :( At public hearing) You, as citizens now, have got the future of your community in your hands. @(Footage-of-Grey-wi) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) He has an unlikely Tonto, a former member of the Chicago Mob, who goes by the alias B.J. Jahoda, who turned on the Mob and became a star witness for government prosecutors. Now he testifies for Grey against legal casinos. @!Mr-B.J-JAHODA : Remember, organized gambling is generally this : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expense of you, your neighbors and your family. They 're -- they 're -- they 're ruthless. @!SAFER : Ruthless -- as ruthless as the Mob? @!Mr-JAHODA : In -- in many -- in many cases, I think they 're more ruthless because the Mob generally only targets, keep in mind, the successful, the prosperous, the influential. The casino operators go after everybody. Nobody gets a pass. @(Footage-of-unident) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) Not everyone in Pittsburg, California, saw it that way. Unidentified Man 4 : That casino would be the greatest thing that ever happened. @(Footage-of-public-) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) With passions running high, there was a packed house for a debate held at the local community college. Pittsburg 's police department actually wanted the casino, since it would require hiring more police and a new fleet of cars. Unidentified Man 5 : This is what the police are looking at : We 're looking at the safety of ourselves, of the community, our families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long term, to staff those officers and that equipment. @!Rev-GREY : Conversely, if we 're not to -- to in -- negatively impact your job, are we to grow more police? Is that the American dream? You bring something in that creates crime, and then we hire more officers? @(Footage-of-Albert-) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) And Grey was not impressed when the man behind the casino, developer Albert Seeno, said his plan would bring more than 500 jobs to Pittsburg, and generate millions for the city treasury. @!Rev-GREY : Mr. Seeno, I heard the millions there. The city gets that. What do you get? @!Mr-ALBERT-SEENO-@1 : There 's a profit margin, just like the grocery store. @!Rev-GREY : Well, grocery stores are 1 percent to 2 percent. Casinos in Illinois are making 20 percent to 30 percent profit for the owners. Can you put yourself between 1 percent and 2 percent and 30 percent? @!Mr-SEENO : No, but I would be happy with the -- some type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell you what it is, because... @!Rev-GREY : Well, in the Midwest we call them cash cows, and the owners have them. @(Footage-of-gaming-) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) And this is the biggest cash cow of all, the slot machine : on the job 24 hours a day, no salary, no benefits. He is the license to print money. At Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut, the profit from the slots alone is more than $ 1 million a day. That 's just from the slot machines at just one casino. It should also be pointed out that here in rural Connecticut, crime is also a bonanza. Calls to local police went up 400 percent four years after gambling arrived. @!Mr-JAHODA : They plan to -- to turn our kids and grandkids into -- into serial slot junkies. They want you to bring your kids to Vegas. That 's why they -- they 've opened up -- what do you call those little things where you throw kids? @!SAFER : Nurseries? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of thing. @(Footage-of-signs-f) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) Families in Pittsburg, California, need not worry. In that referendum, the casino was defeated by a vote of 2-1. Chalk another one up for Tom Grey ; not bad for a man whose only resource is a $ 24,000-a-year stipend from the Methodist Church. Your opposition calls you a -- a zealot, a religious nut. True? @!Rev-GREY : I think I 'm a person that has a certain value base. And fanatic? I 'll tell you, I 'm -- I 'm locked on them. And it 's them or us. @!Mr-FRANK-FAHRENKOP : I think Tom 's a sincere guy. Now he 's also -- he loves the David vs. Goliath. @(Footage-of-Safer-w) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) Goliath 's spin doctor is Frank Fahrenkopf, who 's paid about $ 800,000 a year by the American Gaming Association to lobby for gambling. That 's about 30 times more than Grey gets. Fahrenkopf is a Washington insider who ran the Republican National Committee under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!Mr-FAHRENKOPF : It 's always been gaming to me because there 's no word games. I mean, Tom always says, ' Well, they 're trying to -- to play games with the words. ' That 's not... @!SAFER : Well, you are trying to play games with the words. Gambling has a kind of nasty, suggestive connotation. Gaming is having fun. @!Mr-FAHRENKOPF : Well, you said that. I -- I 'm not sure I agree with that. @!SAFER : What gives gambling a bad name or a reputation for immorality is you ca n't win. @!Mr-FAHRENKOPF : Some people do win ; certainly not the majority or there would n't be any business out there left. @!SAFER : Mm-hmm. @!Mr-FAHRENKOPF : But other people view it also as a recreational activity. @!Rev-GREY : Frank will say, ' But, going to movies is entertainment. We 're just like going to movies. ' Well, how many people walk out to the parking lot and shoot themselves after seeing " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voiceover) Talk like that brought him national attention as gambling 's nemesis. One small voice grew into a national protest. Unidentified Man 6 : Ayes 19, nays 41. @!SAFER :( Voiceover) He lobbied heavily in New York, and last January the State Senate rejected casino gambling. They only had to look across the Hudson River at Atlantic City to see what gambling has wrought. There 's no question, it 's a gambling mecca. Busloads of day-trippers stream into town nonstop, but most never spend a dime outside the casinos, which is great if you own a casino, but bad if you live in Atlantic City. @!Mr-FAHRENKOPF : That 's the free market system. That -- that 's capitalism. @!Rev-GREY : Oh, 5 percent of the population will become compulsive gamblers, will lose everything they have. And Mr. Fahrenkopf says, ' Tom, you 're hysterical. The vast majority of Americans can gamble without any problem. ' @!Mr-FAHRENKOPF : Is there 4 percent or 5 percent that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you close that down and deprive the other 96 percent of exercising what is their right? @!Rev-GREY : And I said, ' Well, which five out of 100 do you want me to give you, Frank, when you come into town, that you 'll take everything they own? Will you take care of them when they crap out? ' @(Footage-of-various) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) No, he wo n't. But the industry does say it is trying to help the addicted. @!Mr-FAHRENKOPF : The first grant 's just been made to the Harvard Medical School, School of Addiction, up -- up in Boston. @!SAFER : How much? @!Mr-FAHRENKOPF : The first grant 's $ 140,000. @!Rev-GREY : A hundred forty-thousand -- now, let 's -- let 's be big. That 's chump change. @!SAFER : OK, chump change. It 's all a scam, is what you 're saying. @!Rev-GREY : It 's -- cover their ass. @(Footage-of-gambler) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) Covering backsides is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 's election, the gambling industry gave millions to candidates. Is one party more susceptible than another, or... @!Rev-GREY : The beauty of this is we 've caught them both out at the feeding trough in the open. They 're both equal opportunity pigs at this point. @(On-phone) Is the congressman in yet this morning? @(Footage-of-Grey-at) @!SAFER :( Voiceover) Now the issue has become national. A presidential commission has begun a two-year study to determine, once and for all, the exact economic and social effects of legal gambling. Tom Grey maintains that whatever the short-term benefits are, the price is way too high. @!Rev-GREY :( At public hearing) And I would not sacrifice one of my neighbors so that I could have a cheap meal and a little bit of tax money rebate. I would n't do it to my children or my grandchildren and say that America wound up being casinos. @!SAFER : Next Wednesday, the President 's Commission on Gambling begins hearings in Washington. @(Announcements)
