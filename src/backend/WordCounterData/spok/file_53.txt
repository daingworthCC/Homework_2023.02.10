228741 BOB @!SCHIEFFER, host : And joining us now, Chris Matthews of The San Francisco Examiner, Gwen Ifill of The New York Times. I 'd like to get both of your reactions to what you have heard this morning. What 's going on here? The president is taking a tremendous battering on his handling of foreign policy, it seems to me, and perhaps the place to start is to ask you, Chris, is it justified? @!Mr-CHRISTOPHER-MAT : Well, it 's a highly aggressive foreign policy this weekend. To put it -- put together a blockade, which is an act of war against a -- a Third World country, is a very aggressive thing to do. The trouble is we have an aggressive foreign policy. We 're talking about going to Somalia, we 're in -- I mean, we 're in Somalia. We 're talking about going to Bosnia, but we have a passive president on foreign policy. He 's sort of trying to drive foreign policy from the backseat, and I think people resent it. @!SCHIEFFER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gwen? @!Ms-GWEN-IFILL-@1Th : I do n't necessarily agree with that because the prob -- one of the problems that this -- the president has faced is that he is in a position where he does n't have a lot of choices. You talk to any of his advisers, and they 'll tell you what they want to do most of all if they had their dearest wish was to talk about health care and to talk about domestic policy issues. They have n't had that opportunity. And one of the things that happens repeatedly in this administration is that some sort of foreign policy challenge raises itself. Now the problem in Somalia is not necessarily the problem in Haiti, and that 's that they were n't paying close enough attention. But the problems which will continue as in the post-Cold War world is that there will always be something. And they will have to establish -- Senator Lugar has -- has criticized this administration for not establishing a consistent enough response to what the United States ' ro -- role should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're in right now. @!SCHIEFFER : Well, you know, it -- it is interesting, because the -- the great lesson that we all learn, that presidents always learn, is that you -- you can control certain things but you can not control events. @!Ms-IFILL : Exactly. @!SCHIEFFER : And -- and -- and you just have to deal with them. Foreign policy crises do n't -- do n't come on schedule. They -- they always happen at inoppor -- inopportune times. But the thing that I 'm wondering about is last week, we see reports coming out of the White House quoting the president on Somalia saying : Why was n't I told about this? Why did n't I know about this? Then this morning, I 'm hearing the ambassador to the UN, Madeleine Albright, saying : Look, he knew all about it. I was following orders when I voted for these UN resolutions. What -- what 's your... @!Mr-MATTHEWS : Well, common sense -- common sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every morning. He knows he has troops in Somalia, and he knows generally what their mission is i -- which is nation building. It 's a very aggressive, as I said before, foreign policy with a passive attitude. It 's a very dangerous thing to leave our men out there exposed in a situation where they 're playing policemen. I thought we learned a lesson in Beirut -- do n't put Americans out to do police work. I mean, we can do certain strategic things like the Persian Gulf other countries ca n't do. Other countries can distribute food, other countries can do patrol duty. I think when you put Americans out at point, as we 've done in Somalia, as we may do in Bosnia and we may well do that in the next couple of days in Haiti, we have Americans vs. Third Worlders. That 's a terrible situation to be in. We 're the outsider coming in with guns. The inside tends to unite together. It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to cause a big problem if we try to go in. @!Ms-IFILL : Madeleine Albright has one of the toughest jobs in this administration. She is the ambassador to a body, the United Nations, that everyone is blaming for all of the problems, especially the president, not in very harsh language, but he certainly raised on several occasions his disappointment that he was -- he felt -- he feels tricked into a police action in Somalia. He ca n't blame the United Nat -- Nations for what 's happening in Haiti. Everything that he 's deciding to do in Haiti is his own -- is -- is something that he has chosen to pursue and, as you could see from the earlier segments, is raising concerns in both the -- the Democratic and the Republican sides of the aisle. @!SCHIEFFER : Gwen, let me ask you this question. Do you think the fact that President Clinton did not serve in the military have anything to do -- I mean, the question I raised with Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the military? Is he ignoring advice he is getting from the military? But I 'm just wondering what is his relationship to the military and his military advisers? @!Ms-IFILL : I do n't think that the fact that he did n't serve has a lot to do with it. I -- I really could n't tell you exactly how his military advisers view him, but he 's the president of the United States. He 's getting the best advice that 's available probably in the world about what 's happening in every single battle theater, if you want to call it that, around the country. So he should be in the position whether he had prior sensitivity or a brand-new sensitivity to know what 's going on. @!SCHIEFFER : You 've got 30 seconds, Chris. @!Mr-MATTHEWS : I -- I think the mood of the country is very strong here. It 's -- he 's an historic president. Every president since Eisenhower, all the way through to George Bush, served in World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only did n't serve in Vietnam, made a great deal of effort not to serve. I think the people want a domestic president. They do n't want all this foreign policy adventurism. They do n't want us to talk -- this talk of lone superpower. Every time I hear that phrase, I know somebody 's up to something. They want us to do something again. It 's like if we could put a man on the moon, we can do this. Everybody wants us to do things in the world except the American people. The American people do not support these activities, this aggressive Wilsonian foreign policy, and I think Clinton 's going to find it out in the next couple of weeks. @!SCHIEFFER : All right. I 'm sorry, but we have to leave it there.
