228941 BOB @!SCHIEFFER, host : And we start this morning with Congressman John Kasich, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, a key player in all the Republican doings in Washington these days. Gloria Borger is here with us in the studio to join in the questioning this morning. @!Mr-Kasich-let-me-# Representative JOHN KASICH( Republican, Ohio) : Well, Bob, I -- I 'm a little confused by it, because 93 percent of all the tax benefits, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, will flow to people under $ 100,000. As you know, the biggest bulk of the tax cut is the child tax credit, which goes to people under $ 100,000. People with children under $ 100,000 are going to get a $ 500 tax credit per child. That is the biggest cost of this program. So I 'm very confused when -- when people start saying that this is a plan that favors the rich. I think the White House has been frankly somewhat muted in its criticism which is good, but for some of the Democratic leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rhetoric, Bob, because you know what they are playing? They are playing the old class warfare card. And I 've got to tell you the president is going to unveil a program to talk about race, try to heal the country, and I think it 's outrageous that there are Democratic leaders who are trying to divide America. It 's the last thing we need. Look, I 'm a blue-collar kid. My dad carried mail on his back, and the bottom line is, is that the child tax credit is good. The capital gains reduction, the bulk of it goes to people under $ 100,000. Middle-income people now are capital gain wage earners, and in addition to it, we do n't want to punish people who built small businesses by taxing away everything that they earned when they die. So why do n't we stop this business of dividing America and stop this -- this outrageous rhetoric about class warfare and let 's -- let 's celebrate the fact that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president, if he has some legitimate complaints about the education provisions in this bill, we 've got to respond to them. That 's part of our agreement, but I think the rhetoric has been way beyond what the reality could ever be in terms of this package. @!SCHIEFFER : All right. @!GLORIA-BORGER-@1CB : Well, Congressman, you know, they 're -- you 're talking about the splits that -- that you see in the Democratic Party between the White House and the president, but there also have been splits in your own party lately. You had a big problem with this disaster relief bill. All of your leadership waged a fight that a lot of people did n't believe they should have waged, and the leadership voted against this disaster relief bill and you opposed your leadership on that, and you finally voted for it. What is going on in the Republican... @!Rep-KASICH : Well... @!BORGER :... Party in the House? @!Rep-KASICH : Gloria, there 's two things in regard -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all, the provisions that were attached to the flood bill, one, would have prevented a closedown of the government if we ca n't reach agreement this fall with the president. I do n't understand why the president is n't for that ; and secondly, it 's in regard to the census. When we do a census, we ought to count everybody. That 's what they were trying to attach to the flood bill. When the president indicated he was n't going to sign that, we should n't have attached it, but the fact is, I -- I ca n't figure out why the president would n't want to sign that. The fact is, though, we should have sent him that clean flood bill. We should have got it done right off the bat, but fortunately, we 've now done it and the people are getting the support they need. @!BORGER : So -- so what happened to your leadership there? @!Rep-KASICH : Gloria, it 's a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have another shutdown and that the p -- that there was no reason for the president to avoid... @!BORGER : But did n't they make it worse... @!Rep-KASICH :... signing a bill that shuts the government down. @!BORGER : But did n't they make it worse for Republicans? Did n't it become more of a public relations disaster for you? @!Rep-KASICH : I -- I do n't think we should have pursued attaching those provisions to the flood bill, Gloria. And look, I mean, we 're a party that -- that really, to a large degree, marches on the basis of principle and strongly fel -- held ideas, and, you know, we have our disagreements, but fortunately, we work them out. We passed the bill. I wish we had done it sooner, but -- but we got it done. @!SCHIEFFER : Well, Mr. Kasich, I mean, some people in the House are saying it 's a -- it 's a -- it 's a party that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the latest example. There -- as you well know, there 's a ' Dear colleague ' letter that 's going around amongst members of the Republican Caucus in the House, and -- and I 'll just read you a little from this letter. It says, ' The vote on the flood relief bill is only the latest example of leadership blunders. It leaves important Medicare changes alone on one of the 95 continuing revo -- resolutions, signals a willingness earlier this year to give up on tax cuts. ' It goes on and on, ' the time has come we should have a vote of confidence on the current leadership. ' Do you think that the caucus ought to have a... @!Rep-KASICH : That somebody running for leadership? @!SCHIEFFER : Well, it may well be. @!Rep-KASICH : Look, Bob, it 's... @!SCHIEFFER : But I mean, it -- it 's an example of -- of -- of the kind of turmoil going on amongst Republicans. @!Rep-KASICH : Yeah. @!SCHIEFFER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership now in the House and maybe go in a different direction, or what 's the way out of this for you all? @!Rep-KASICH : OK, Bob -- Bob, here 's the fact. Look, we have basically completed the Contract With America. We said we wanted to get a line-item veto, we passed it ; we said we wanted to reduce the size of Congress, in terms of committees and staff, we 've done it ; we said we want to apply the same laws on -- on ourselves that we apply on you, we 've done it ; we said we wanted a balanced budget, we forced the president to go along with an agreement that does it ; we said we wanted tax cuts for families, we 've passed it. We -- We 've got an agreement to do it. @!SCHIEFFER : OK, but -- but -- but let me... @!Rep-KASICH : But you see, the -- the point is, we are accomplishing our agenda, and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some people in our conference to be able to accept the victory and to realize that rather than struggling, we should be celebrating the fact that we are changing the nature of this country, and that 's what drives a lot of the Democrats in the Congress crazy, because the president has been going along with us. @!SCHIEFFER : We -- we -- we 're about out of time here, but just let me just ask you : Do you think there ought to be a vote of confidence on the leadership in the House Republican Caucus? @!Rep-KASICH : We just -- we -- we 're winning the -- we won the Super Bowl. We just won the sa -- the -- the NBA championship. Why would we want to vote to reaffirm -- I mean, I 'm always glad to vote to reaffirm. We 're winning and, Bob, the facts speak for themselves. @!SCHIEFFER : OK. @!Rep-KASICH : We 're going to have a balanced budget, tax cuts and a whole host of changes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and across this country. @!SCHIEFFER : All right. We 're going to leave it there. Thank you so much... @!Rep-KASICH : Thank you. @!SCHIEFFER :... Congressman Kasich, for joining us. We 'll be back in a minute to talk about race relations in America -- in a minute. @(Announcements)
