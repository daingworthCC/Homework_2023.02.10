225641 HARRY @!SMITH, co-host : This morning 's Big Story : the Fuhrman tapes. Judge Lance Ito is expected to rule this week on how much, if any, of the audio recordings the O.J. Simpson jury can hear. The tapes reportedly portray Detective Mark Fuhrman, in his own words, as a racist with a history of planting evidence to get convictions. Let 's get some perspective now from attorney Kristin Jeannette-Meyers of Court TV, who joins us from Los Angeles. And with us from Indianapolis is our consultant, former Prosecutor Greg Garrison. Good morning, folks. @!Ms-KRISTIN-JEANNET : Good morning, Harry. @!Mr-GREG-GARRISON-@ : Hi, Harry. @!SMITH : All right. Kristin, let 's start with a real quick review of these tapes. These are conversations Mark Fuhrman had with a screenwriter in North Carolina. Is the idea th -- is this a lot of braggadocio or is this the real Mark Fuhrman on these tapes? @!Ms-JEANNETTE-MEYER : That may be up to the jurors. These tapes span 10 years, and there 's even a portion made after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Now the judge has already ruled that evidence about Mark Fuhrman that relates to his racial bias combined with planting evidence against people will come in to impeach him. And so if, as promised by the defense, on these tapes, Mark Fuhrman really does talk about, A, his dislike for black people and, B, his willingness to fabricate evidence against them... @!SMITH : Mm-hmm. @!Ms-JEANNETTE-MEYER :... then it is likely coming in. The only thing that could save Mark Fuhrman would be if the judge rules that it 's too far back in time. He has done that on certain incidents in this case regarding Fuhrman, and that may happen about the widely publicized... @!SMITH : Mm-hmm. @!Ms-JEANNETTE-MEYER :... 1978 incident... @!SMITH : All right. @!Ms-JEANNETTE-MEYER :... that we 've learned about. @!SMITH : And -- and if we have time, we 'll get back to that in a couple of seconds. Greg Garrison, what 's your best guess as you sit there in Indianapolis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to let the tapes in or not? @!Mr-GARRISON : Oh, I think he will, Harry. I think we 've gone beyond the arguments that -- that concerned us before we knew all the contents of these tapes. Just some pretty basic, almost axiomatic evidence at this point. If he does n't let it in, I think he probably commits pretty bad error. And I think when it comes in, it is of cataclysmic importance to the case, and it may just sink the whole ship. I do n't think there 's a good reason not to have it come in. And as far as the age of the -- of the -- the claims themselves... @!SMITH : Mm-hmm. @!Mr-GARRISON :... it would be one thing to say, ' Well, that 's remote at ' 78, ' except we may have a constant pattern of this right up to and including 1994. And... @!SMITH : Let 's -- we... @!Mr-GARRISON :... it 's kind of hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's talk about hypotheticals here for a second. You 're the defense ; the tapes are admitted. Kristin, what do you do with them? @!Ms-JEANNETTE-MEYER : Well, if I 'm the defense, what I 'd do is I 'd day, ' This proves what we have been letting you know about all along, which is that Mark Fuhrman is a rogue cop who has a history of planting evidence against black defendants because he does n't like them and there 's nothing to say that he did n't do it in this case. ' @!SMITH : Mm-hmm. @!Ms-JEANNETTE-MEYER : And to -- to just beg to the jurors, ' You ca n't send him to prison for the rest of his life with this kind of doubt. ' You know, and -- and that 's powerful if they do believe that Mark Fuhrman in the past has planted evidence... @!SMITH : Right. @!Ms-JEANNETTE-MEYER :... or fabricated evidence. It 's tough to go in there and send a man to prison for -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our hypothetical. You 're the old prosecutor there in Indianapolis, Greg Garrison. Those tapes come into court. What do you do with them? @!Mr-GARRISON : First thing you 've got to do is -- is basically excise and sink Mark Fuhrman. When you get to the argument stage in the trial, first of all, you try to explain some of it with the braggadocio and the overstatement and get it at least watered down a little bit. You get to the end of the case and you say, ' Folks forget him. Do n't care about him. Here is the enormous quantity of evidence I 've got without the guy. Do n't need him, do n't care about him. And all this other stuff is independent of him, and you do n't have reasonable doubt. whether you believe that or not. ' But -- and then you end it with this. ' He may be the rottennest snake in the world, but you got no evidence to show you, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rottenness in this case. ' And that 's the critical difference. However, we 're talking Los Angeles, we 're talking about a place where racial tensions and racial violence between the police and the people go way back. And I do n't know. That 's a heck of an audience to try to sing that song to. @!SMITH : Kristin, they play the tapes. Does Fuhrman go back on the stand again? @!Ms-JEANNETTE-MEYER : He may go back on the stand. The defense is saying now they want him up there. But he has a lawyer and we may hear Mark Fuhrman exercising his Fifth Amendment rights. I -- we 're told on the tape that Mark Fuhrman says to the screenwriter, ' I do n't want to talk anymore about this incident, because the statute of limitations has n't run. ' That 's the time under... @!SMITH : Mm-hmm. @!Ms-JEANNETTE-MEYER :... which one can be prosecuted for a crime. And so if it 's true what is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing any more talking and that, of course, will be damning in itself. @!SMITH : And the other aspect of this, if I 'm the defense and I 'm sitting there -- we 've got Mark Fuhrman -- What? -- two and a half months ago sitting on the stand. They asked him point-blank, ' Have you ever used this word in the last 10 years? ' He said, ' No. ' These tapes come into evidence and it is one after another after another. Greg Garrison, this thing -- this -- this could be really the turning point in the whole trial. @!Mr-GARRISON : Boy, it sure could, Harry. And just... @!SMITH : Thirty seconds. @!Mr-GARRISON : Just like the -- like Mr. Goldman said the other day, ' What an awful shame. ' It is a huge turning point, not one which I intend to -- to water down or -- or -- or try to suggest is not important. It 's of mammoth importance because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fuhrman is crucially important. He is sort of the persona... @!SMITH : Mm-hmm. @!Mr-GARRISON :... of the -- of the professional police officer and professional investigator. And when he goes down, I 'm afraid an awful lot of people fall with him. @!SMITH : All right. @!Mr-GARRISON : Again, given the jury that 's hearing the evidence... @!SMITH : Mm-hmm. @!Mr-GARRISON :... and I ca n't blame them a bit. It 's going to be very tough. @!SMITH : All right. @!Ms-JEANNETTE-MEYER : As Mark Fuhrman allegedly predicted himself on those tapes. @!SMITH : Greg, Kristin, thank you so much. Appreciate it. Our thanks to Greg Garrison and Kristin Jeannette-Meyers. Fourteen after the hour. We 'll be right back.
