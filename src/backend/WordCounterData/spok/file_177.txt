4072341 @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) It is, Sam, thank you. That 's coming up in our next half hour. But now, mixed messages on breast cancer screening. Earlier, we told you about an independent panel 's new recommendation about mammograms, saying that women should not get them until they turn 50. And they only need them every two years instead of every year. This is a departure from current guidelines, as you know, which advocate regular mammograms starting at age 40. So, what should patients do? @GRAPHICS @GRAPHICS @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) These are the faces of breast cancer. Mothers, daughters, sisters. Anne Marie Flynn was 41 when she had her second annual mammogram, the diagnoses, stage three breast cancer. Her tumor was small, but aggressive. @!ANNE-MARIE-FLYNN-@# If I had not gone in for a routine mammogram at that age, I would have a very different prognosis. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) After two surgeries, chemotherapy and radiation, the mom of two has been tumor-free for five years. She believes all women over 40 should get annual screenings. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's important that when they 're making these recommendations, that they realize the affect that it has on families. @GRAPHICS @GRAPHICS @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for women under 50, causing some doctors to worry the new guidelines could prevent women from making a life-saving choice. @!DR-MARIE-SAVARD-@1# @(Off-camera) We know mammograms are not perfect. But they are the best things we have to diagnose women early. These guidelines will give insurance companies the excuse not to cover these potentially life-saving mammograms in young women. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) But health professionals who devised the new recommendations, say mammograms can cause harm, too, like overexposure to radiation. They advise women to wait until they are 50, and get a screening not every year, but every two years. @!DOCTOR-DIANA-PETIT# When screening beginning at 40 to 49, the benefits are smaller. The false positive rates are higher, than when screening at older ages. @GRAPHICS @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) 44-year-old Karen Clark agrees. She wrote us to say that mammograms may offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with stage three breast cancer. I found the lump myself. The mammogram in January completely missed it. It likely had been growing for several years. " @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) For more, we 're joined by two renowned breast cancer experts. Dr. Susan Love is the president of the Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation. She joins us there in California, and she supports these new recommendations. Dr. Marisa Weiss, an oncologist and the president of breastcancer.org, she supports more frequent screening, and joins us here in the studio. Good morning to you both. And I, I want to get the bottom line from both of you about your recommendations, about what you believe these recommendations should be, and your bottom line. Dr. Weiss, let me start with you. @!DOCTOR-MARISA-WEIS# Well, I think that these proposed changes in the guidelines represent a drastic step backwards. These are old studies. These are old technologies. And the study is using this old information to give future breast cancer guidelines for screening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the most common cancer to affect women. And mammography is the only test proven to save lives. So, I believe that these guidelines are not an improvement. They 're neglectful. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Dr. Love? @!DOCTOR-SUSAN-LOVE-# Well, I actually do n't agree. Mammography is the only tool shown to save lives, but in women over 50. It 's never been shown to work in - women under 50. And the studies actually are very good, randomized, controlled studies. The newer techniques, digital mammography, have not been shown to be any better than the older techniques. And the problem is, that they 're not, that there 's a risk to them, that the radiation risk is higher in younger women, that the ability to find cancers is n't as good, that the - ability to miss cancers is much higher. So, what we need to be doing is not using a test that does n't work and has risks, but finding something that really does work, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer and stopping it. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Dr. Weiss, when we look at, around the world, the recommendations are what the new recommendations, new guidelines are, 50, at the age of 50, not 40. So, is it, is it going back or going forward, that we are getting in line with what the rest of the world is doing? @!DOCTOR-MARISA-WEIS# Well, this is, it 's not true that the entire rest of the world is doing this. Take Sweden, for example. All women in the population of Sweden get mammography starting at age 40. And women between 40 and 49 in Sweden, they saw a great decrease in the risk of dying of breast cancer in that population, it was as high as 40% improvement. And so, I think that the screening guidelines in the United States should lead the world. And I do n't see those other - those other countries as setting an example that we should follow. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Dr. Love, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. No, I was going to say, our results are not, not any better than any of these other countries that actually do n't screen women from 40 to 50. The issue is not whether women get breast cancer at 40. Of course, they do. And it 's not whether some women can find the cancers on mammogram. It can. The issue is a public policy issue. It 's whether it can change the outcome in sufficient number of women. And the studies that you 're referring to, you have to follow the women well for 10 to 12 years. So, they 're in their 50s by the time you see a benefit. And by 50, the breast tissue is less dense. And mammography does become more useful. So, the issue is, is not depriving young women of their God-given right to be radiated. It 's really, let 's not give them radiation if it 's not really helping them. And let 's find something better. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the best that we have, and digital mammography, which is available today. @!DOCTOR-SUSAN-LOVE-# Not in young women. @!DOCTOR-MARISA-WEIS# Is superior to the film mammography that was in these studies. @!DOCTOR-SUSAN-LOVE-# Not in the studies. Not in the study that compared them. @!DOCTOR-MARISA-WEIS# Particularly in women who are between ages 40 and 49. And the reality is, is that in terms of radiation exposure, a flight from New York to Denver and back gives you more radiation exposure than one mammogram. So, there 's no question... @!DOCTOR-SUSAN-LOVE-# That 's right, but if you do them every year, 40 to 50, it 's cumulative. And indeed, causes as many cancers as it cures. And... @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) But, that was n't really given as one of the reasons why in the study. @!DOCTOR-MARISA-WEIS# The studies that demonstrated an increase in breast cancer risk, supposedly attributed to mammography, were contamination studies, where women who were not screened, when they felt a lump, or had a symptom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it look like the women getting mammograms had more cancers from the mammography, which is not the case. @!DOCTOR-SUSAN-LOVE-# It 's just calculating from the radiation, it 's not. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) Dr. Love, Dr. Love, just a moment here, please, thank you. Because I talked to you, when I was going through my diagnosis. I was 46. No history in my family. 70 to 80% of people who are diagnosed with breast cancer have no previous history, even though you - tell us to be aware of that. I found it with a lump. The mammogram did not detect it. The ultrasound did. You heard the woman in the piece who said she does n't believe that she would even be alive today if it were these new recommendations. How do you respond when people say these things to you and feel that because of early detection, they 're still with us today? @!DOCTOR-SUSAN-LOVE-# Well, I think, you know, the problem is, we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've made it sound like every cancer grows at a constant rate. And they all can be found early at a curable state. And I wish that were true, but there 's some cancers that are very aggressive, that you 're, no matter when you find them, they 're really going to still be bad. There are some that are very slow-growing, and it does n't matter when you find those. And you can shift some a little bit. And that works a lot better in, in women after 50, when their breasts are less dense, than it does in younger women. The experience you had is the more common one. Where mammography does n't show a cancer and you have a lump. And a lot of times, it gives women a false sense of security. So, this is n't, we 're not talking about something that 's completely harmless. We 're really talking about something that has a downside, as well as an upside. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world, the government covers mammography for everybody. In this country, that 's not the case. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) We 're running out of time. So, bottom line from you both. A woman watching this morning, and men, because men get breast cancer, too, if you have breast tissue, you 're, you 're susceptible. Just quickly, if you 're a woman or you 're someone watching today, what do you do? What do you do? @!DOCTOR-MARISA-WEIS# We use the best tools that you have. And I tell my own patients, start getting your mammogram at age 40, get it annually after that. Mammography can save your lives. And if you 're at high risk, you might even start screening earlier. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) Susan, quickly? @!DOCTOR-SUSAN-LOVE-# And I say if you 're at average risk, get your first mammogram at age 50. Be aware of your breasts. If you feel something abnormal, get it checked out. And join the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of this disease and stop it. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Voiceover) I was hoping you were going to get that in. I know you 've been doing great work with that. Dr. Susan Love, - Dr. Marisa, Marisa Weiss, thank you very, very much. @!ROBIN-ROBERTS-@1-A# @(Off-camera) This is a heated discussion. Go online for more information. And please let us know what you think. Go to our shoutout board. We 'll be right back. COMMERCIAL BREAK '
