232441 ED @!BRADLEY, host : @(Theme-music) @!BRADLEY : Like any lawyer, Bill Phillips spends a lot of time in the law library close to his office and his home. That 's not unusual. What is unusual is that this library was mandated by the Supreme Court which ruled that law books must be available to those who might need them most. That ruling opened the door to people like Phillips, a man with a sharp legal mind and an impressive success rate. And as Victoria Corderi found, he does n't have to look far to find clients. @!CAPTIVE-CLIENTS-# @(Footage-of-Phillip) @!Mr-BILL-PHILLIPS : This was a big hurdle to get over, the denial. @!Mr-KEVIN-FERRIN-@1 : Well, we 're going to trial now. Mr. @!PHILLIPS : We 're going to trial. @!MR-FERRIN : It seems that the federal court has agreed with you and not with them. Mr. @!PHILLIPS : Yeah, OK. @!VICTORIA-CORDERI :( Voiceover) Lawyer and client. @!Mr-FERRIN : All right. I 'll see you this afternoon on the handball court. Mr. @!PHILLIPS : OK. OK. @!CORDERI :( Voiceover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in upstate New York. But then, so is the lawyer. Mr. @!PHILLIPS : The only way we could get out would be a 440-10 motion back to the original court... @!CORDERI :( Voiceover) Bill Phillips is what 's called a ' jailhouse lawyer, ' an inmate with no law degree who 's become a self-taught legal expert... Mr. @!PHILLIPS :... see, wow, look at -- you 're violating the law here... @!CORDERI :( Voiceover)... in this case, one with a waiting list of clients. qwq @( Footage-of-Phillip Mr. @!PHILLIPS :( Voiceover) I think that I would have probably made a halfway decent lawyer. I think I would have been pretty good. I think -- I think I would have been known. Let 's put it that way. I mean, let 's put it this way. I 've never in my live done anything where I do n't do it exceptionally well. @(Footage-of-Phillip) @!CORDERI :( Voiceover) What Bill Phillips used to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( Voiceover) That was before he was imprisoned 17 1/2 years ago... @(Footage-of-Phillip) @!CORDERI :( Voiceover)... back when he was a flamboyant New York City cop on the take and willing to talk about it after he got caught. qwq @( Footage-of-Phillip Unidentified Man : What percentage of the plainclothesmen assigned to the division -- to the 6th Division at that time do you feel participated in the pad? Mr. @!PHILLIPS : Everyone, to my knowledge. Man : Everyone? Mr. @!PHILLIPS : Everyone. @(Footage-of-Phillip) @!CORDERI :( Voiceover) Phillips testified before the Knapp Commission, a special group formed more than two decades ago to investigate widespread corruption within the New York City Police Department, the investigation sparked by the famous Serpico case. qwq @( Footage-of-Phillip Mr. @!PHILLIPS : I never knew a plainclothesman yet that was in plainclothes for more than two months that was n't on the pad. @!CORDERI :( Voiceover) Bill Phillips ' testimony before the Knapp Commission shook up New York and received major television coverage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his cooperation and should have gone scott-free after the hearings. Instead, they ended up being his undoing. A police detective watching Bill Phillips on TV thought he looked an awful lot like a murder suspect he was looking for. Bill Phillips eventually was arrested, indicted and convicted. The cop who worked to put away bad guys on both sides of the law was himself sentenced to life behind these walls. qwq @( Footage-of-Corderi Mr. @!PHILLIPS : I thought it was the end of the world. There was n't a guy in the whole prison system who did n't know who I was. So I -- I just walked out into the yard and... @!CORDERI : So you walked in here a marked man, almost? Mr. @!PHILLIPS : Oh, of course, of course. So I walked into the yard and said, ' Here I am. ' There 's still a lot of people who do n't like ex-cops. So -- you can never change their mind. If I would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would have destroyed myself. But I took that hate and I took that animosity, and I channeled it in -- in -- into positive directions. qwq @( Footage-of-Phillip Mr. @!PHILLIPS : We showed the judge that the eyewitness first of all was blind... @!CORDERI :( Voiceover) Is this a survival tactic, becoming a lawyer? Mr. @!PHILLIPS :( Voiceover) No, no. It started out that way for survival for my own -- my own intellect and my own mind. Then it became a situation where, ' Wow. I can really help a lot of guys in here. ' qwq @( Footage-of-Phillip Mr. @!PHILLIPS : We 're going to get the judge 's notes, OK... @!CORDERI :( Voiceover) Counseling inmates is Phillips ' full-time job in prison. qwq @( Footage-of-Corderi Mr. @!PHILLIPS : I make, I think, $ 10.78 a week. I could make -- I could make $ 100 a month in industry -- yeah -- if I worked overtime and so forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) He can not argue cases in court, but he can research and write appeals for inmates to give to their outside lawyers. Mr. @!PHILLIPS : I 've heard your testimony, contrived evidence -- the whole bit. @(Footage-of-Phillip) @!CORDERI :( Voiceover) He 's become an expert at finding critical loopholes and technicalities that many lawyers miss. @!PHILLIPS :( Voiceover) I 've read thousands of cases. So I can read a transcript now, and I can pick out the flaws like they 're red lights. @!CORDERI :( Voiceover) And sometimes his work can help an inmate reduce his sentence. @!Mr-FERRIN : Bill Phillips is to jailhouse lawyering what Muhammed Ali was to boxing. @!Mr-McLAURIN : I 've been here, like, four years now, going on five. And Bill is the best I ever seen. @!Mr-JOE-LIGHT-@1Pri : Without him, I 'd still still be going -- still be there, and I 'd be serving a six-to-12 sentence. qwq @( Footage-of-Phillip Mr. @!PHILLIPS : I got a picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) It was clear to you that it was -- that it was Bill? @!Mr-LIGHT : Yes, it was 100 percent clear to me that it was him. There was no buts about it. @(Footage-of-Light-w) @!CORDERI :( Voiceover) Today Joe Light is back with his family. Three years ago, he was convicted of manslaughter after he got into a fight with an acquaintance and ended up stabbing him to death. @!Mr-LIGHT : You never know what freedom is until your freedom is taken. And once your freedom is taken and you get it back, you treasure it. @(Footage-of-Phillip) @!CORDERI :( Voiceover) Freedom that is the result of Phillips ' legal work. They met in prison. qwq @( Footage-of-Phillip Mr. @!PHILLIPS : There was a guy who really did n't do anything. He got rapped in the head with a blackjack, and he 's a -- he pulled out a knife to protect himself, and he wound up killing his friend. It was a tragic, tragic case. @(Footage-of-Corderi) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand, and we were rolling on the floor. And while I was rolling, I was stabbing him. @!CORDERI : How many times did you stab? @!Mr-LIGHT : Oh, four times. I did n't think that they were going to convict me. I really did n't because all the people that seen it said that the man struck me first. @(Footage-of-Phillip) @!CORDERI :( Voiceover) Phillips prepared a sophisticated appeal, three times the size of the one written by an outside lawyer, arguing, once again, that the killing was justifiable. The appeals court agreed and threw out the case a little more than a year ago. qwq @( Footage-of-Phillip Mr. @!PHILLIPS : And I see this guy running at me, you know. So I looked around, you know. He 's saying, ' Bill, Bill, Bill! ' And he jumped -- jumped me, grabbed -- put his arms around me. @(Footage-of-Light) @!Mr-LIGHT : I was hugging him, and I was crying in his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' qwq @( Footage-of-Phillip Mr. @!PHILLIPS : He said, ' I 'm going home! I 'm going home! ' @(Footage-of-Light) @!Mr-LIGHT : He 's the best thing that ever happened to me. qwq @( Footage-of-Phillip Mr. @!PHILLIPS : I had made a friend. And I gave him another shot at life. qwq @( Footage-of-Phillip Mr. @!PHILLIPS :( Voiceover) I did n't know I had this type of talent. I did n't know I had this type of intellect, because when I was out there, I was a party guy like everybody else. @(Footage-of-police-) @!CORDERI :( Voiceover) A party guy and a cop in the 1960s, a time when gambling operators, bookies, pimps and other criminals regularly paid police to look the other way. qwq @( Footage-of-Phillip Mr. @!PHILLIPS : I had a -- an enormous wardrobe. I had two sports cars and five airplanes, you know. @!CORDERI : Five airplanes? Mr. @!PHILLIPS : Yeah. qwq @( Photo-of-Phillips- Mr. @!PHILLIPS :( Voiceover) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type life, you know. qwq @( Photo-of-Phillips- Mr. @!PHILLIPS :( Voiceover) And I was -- figured there was no end to this thing. @(Footage-of-Corderi) @!Mr-MICHAEL-ARMSTRO : I think he took considerable pride in being about as corrupt as you can get. @!CORDERI :( Voiceover) Lawyer Michael Armstrong was part of the Knapp Commission. @(Footage-of-Phillip) @!Mr-ARMSTRONG : And by scoring the operation, you 'd go in and make an arrest and then allow the man to buy his freedom? Mr. @!PHILLIPS : Yes. @(Footage-of-Armstro) @!Mr-ARMSTRONG : He once said to me that the one thing he really feared was being assigned to Central Park, because, he said, ' What am I going to do? Shake down the squirrels? ' qwq @( Footage-of-Phillip Mr. @!PHILLIPS : Once you start the il -- the illegal process, it 's a degeneration of your whole -- your whole moral character, and you do n't realize it until it 's too late, you know. @(Newspaper-headline) @!CORDERI :( Voiceover) Phillips was convicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He admits to taking bribes from the pimp, but maintains he was set up by his enemies for testifying about police corruption. qwq @( Footage-of-Corderi Mr. @!PHILLIPS : It was an absolute frame job that I -- -I 've alleged this since 1972. That you -- you are going after me for what -- for what reason? Cops do n't go around killing people. @(Footage-of-Phillip) @!CORDERI :( Voiceover) Phillips sees his exhaustive study of the law as his redemption from his former life. He works 70 hours a week helping inmates with their cases. qwq @( Footage-of-Phillip Mr. @!PHILLIPS :( Voiceover) I had managed to take a situation that was totally diabolical and change it into a learning experience... integrity and be able to help a lot of people while I 've been in here. @(Footage-of-Ferrin-) @!Mr-FERRIN : Leona Helmsley and this one -- they have Alan Dershowitz. The black, the Hispanic, the guy that ca n't afford the investigators to go out there and do what they 're supposed to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is the Alan Dershowitz for the poor man. @(Footage-of-Ferrin-) @!CORDERI :( Voiceover) Kevin Ferrin is a convicted robber with an extensive rap sheet. Phillips used a technicality to knock 10 years off his sentence. @(Footage-of-Ferrin) @!Mr-FERRIN : In order to defend me, walk a mile in my shoes. He 's walked 20. @(Footage-of-Phillip) @!CORDERI :( Voiceover) Now you 've very concerned about the rights of the prisoner, but there are people who would say, ' Look, here 's a guy who 's a lifelong robber who 's -- basically, it 's a technicality he 's getting off. So what if his rights are a little violated? You get him off the street. ' qwq @( Footage-of-Corderi Mr. @!PHILLIPS : If you 're going to do the job of prosecuting, do it right. If you do n't have him right, you got to let him go. You 'll get him the next time around. But again, if you do n't have this guy right, he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the staunch protector of the letter of the law... Mr. @!PHILLIPS : I def -- definitely am. @!CORDERI :... when before, you were the gross distorter of the letter of the law. Mr. @!PHILLIPS : Exactly. @(Footage-of-Armstro) @!Mr-ARMSTRONG : The verve and the enthusiasm and the intelligence that he once brought to being a corrupt police officer has now been turned in the direction of being a -- a lawyer. And I think he 's -- he 's an excellent one, and I gather his record bears that out. @(Footage-of-Phillip) @!CORDERI :( Voiceover) Phillips estimates that he 's won more than 50 cases, a number impossible to verify since jailhouse lawyers do n't get the credit for writing appeals. @(Footage-of-Corderi) @!CORDERI : Is there an irony there that you have... Mr. @!PHILLIPS : Sure, it 's an irony. @!CORDERI :... that you have 53 cases -- 54 cases you 've won and the most -- probably the most important case in your life you 're not making any headway? Mr. @!PHILLIPS : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voiceover) Phillips has just lost the seventh appeal in his own case. Mr. @!PHILLIPS : I 'm fighting like a caged lion to get out of here all these years, and I 'll never stop fighting to get out of here... @(Footage-of-Phillip) @!CORDERI :( Voiceover) When he is eligible for parole in 1999, Phillips will be almost 70 years old. Mr. @!PHILLIPS : I hit bottom, and I bounced up. qwq @( Footage-of-Phillip Mr. @!PHILLIPS :( Voiceover) So now all the people that come to me for help, they know that I 'm a fighter. You 've got to have energy to do this. Every day I walk in that law library here, this is a challenge to me. qwq @( Footage-of-Phillip Mr. @!PHILLIPS : I 'm up against the best in the world. These guys out here have gone to law school. They 've got every -- every experience in the world. And I feel good I can beat them at their own game. @(Footage-of-Bradley) @!BRADLEY : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chalked up another success : He 's had one more conviction tossed out. But he also lost one more appeal, the eighth in his own case. Phillips is eligible for parole in 1999. By that time, this jailhouse lawyer will have been in jail himself for 25 years. @(Theme-music)
