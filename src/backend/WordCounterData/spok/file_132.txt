246341 @!HANNAH-STORM-co-h : Well, you all know how that old nursery rhyme goes : First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes baby in the baby carriage. But modern brides are mixing it all up now, and they are getting pregnant before walking down the aisle. Relationship writer Amy Kean has more on this growing trend. qwq @( Excerpt-from- " Funn @!Ms-AMY-KEAN-@1Rela : Barbra Streisand may have been faking her pregnancy in this famous scene from " Funny Girl, " but today 's brides are showing off real bulging bellies. Celebrities like Jennifer Garner and Amanda Peet were pregnant at the altar. Katie Holmes got married after giving birth. Salma Hayek and Jaime Pressly recently announced they 're both engaged and pregnant. Naomi Watts is rumored to wed this summer before she pops. @!Ms-MILLIE-MARTINI- : Today we see so many celebrities who are either pregnant at the altar or they get married after they have a baby. So it 's something people are talking about openly. @!Ms-KEAN : Millie Martini Bratten is the editor in chief of Brides magazine. She says brides with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is definitely gone. If couples have already planned to have a family and it happens to coincide with the wedding, they 're perfectly fine with that. qwq @( Excerpt-from- " The- @!Ms-KEAN : Remember on " The Simpsons " when Homer and Marge had a shotgun wedding after Marge became pregnant? qwq @( Excerpt-from- " The- @!Ms-KEAN : But unlike Marge, today 's moms-to-be are n't necessarily rushing to the altar. qwq @( Excerpt-from- " The- @!Ms-BRATTEN : It 's a different bride and groom today. Their weddings are not like their parents ' weddings, they 're marrying older, they 're living together, they 're doing things all at once. So it 's more about celebration rather than hiding something. @!Ms-KEAN : Rosalie Peng is expecting her first bundle of joy in July. She 's not hiding anything. @!Ms-ROSALIE-PENG-@1 : I feel very proud of how my body looks in a wedding dress. I think it 's a miracle of life to be pregnant and any little girl 's dream, really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like, the best part of your life. @!Ms-KEAN : In fact, a recent survey of bridal shop owners says as many as one in six brides is pregnant. @(Graphic-on-screen) one in six brides is pregnant maternitybride.com @!Ms-KEAN : Lucky for Rosalie, there 's no shortage of stylish maternity wedding gowns. @!Ms-MARA-URSHEL-@1K : Fashion in bridal has been the most exciting that it 's ever been. @!Ms-KEAN : Mara Urshel owns Kleinfeld Bridal, which boasts the largest selection of wedding gowns in the world. She says designers today are working hard to accommodate those expanding waistlines. @!Ms-URSHEL : There 's a lot of empire waistlines being shown, like this one. @!Ms-KEAN : OK, so whose dress is this? @!Ms-URSHEL : This is Carolina Herrera. @!Ms-KEAN : Gorgeous. @!Ms-URSHEL : And this is what would -- a bride would look like if she was really quite far along, maybe five, six, seven months. qwq @( Excerpt-from- " Ridi @!Ms-KEAN : In " Riding in Cars With Boys, " Brittany Murphy and Drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ridi @!Ms-KEAN : So off the screen, what are the rules for newly pregnant newlyweds? Marriage therapist Jane Greer says the key is to stay focused. @!Ms-JANE-GREER-@1Ma : In the past, once the wedding was over, a lot of times many women would go through the post-wedding blues. Now you 've cut right fast-forward to the excitement of having the wedding, starting your married life and beginning your family all at the same time. @!STORM : And Amy Kean 's here to tell us more. Hi, Amy. @!Ms-KEAN : Hi. How are you? @!STORM : You wonder what everyone 's going to think when they look back at that wedding album, right, at those pictures? But... @!Ms-KEAN : I think -- you know, these women look so gorgeous. @!STORM : Yeah. @!Ms-KEAN : And, you know, the truth is it 's such a reality for a lot of women now because... @!STORM : And why is that? @!Ms-KEAN : In your 20s, a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then all of the sudden you 're in your 30s and you 're faced with this much narrower window of time to all the sudden get married and have a family. So sometimes these happy events just kind of overlap. And what really matters is if you love each other. I mean, who really cares if you 're pregnant? @!STORM : For some people, though, there 's still that stigma out there. People talk about shotgun weddings and, you know, a pregnant bride and all of that... @!Ms-KEAN : Of course. Of course. @!STORM :... as sort of a -- sort of a cliche. Is there any downside to doing this? @!Ms-KEAN : I do n't really think there 's any downside. I mean, a lot of people worry that maybe they did n't have enough time together alone before a baby came, but so many couples live together now that presumably by the time they get married, they know each other pretty well. So... @!STORM : Mm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though, being a newlywed... @!Ms-KEAN : It is, it is. @!STORM :... and a new mom. But so many people are jumping off the -- on this trend. You saw the design show house there, right, Carolina Herrera with the mannequin? @!Ms-KEAN : Oh, it 's the perfect time designwise to be -- to be a pregnant bride. @!STORM : Mm-hmm. @!Ms-KEAN : But more importantly -- you know, a lot of these brides are really creative and they 're combining their bridal and their baby registry, and they 're having a big giant party and they 're having, you know, a big shower for both events. And in a way it 's really magical because a lot of them are sort of celebrating starting a family together and a life together at the same time. So there 's just more joy all around for the families. @!STORM : Mm-hmm. And one in six. @!Ms-KEAN : Yes. @!STORM : That 's amazing. @!Ms-KEAN : We were shocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kean, great to have you here. Thanks. @!Ms-KEAN : Thank you. @!STORM : So interesting. @!Ms-KEAN : Yeah.
