221541 @(Theme-music) @!BOARDING-PARTY-# @(Footage-of-a-heart) @!Dr-STEPHEN-GREER-@ : Can you get me a nurse in here? This one 's going to be not ICU but telemetry. qwq @( Looking-at-an-X-ra This is not a -- a bad break. qwq @( Speaking-to-a-pati Where was the pain located? @(Footage-of-Greer) @!HAROLD-DOW-reporti :( Voiceover) By day, Dr. Stephen Greer is an emergency room physician in North Carolina. @!Dr-GREER : We 'll check on you a little later. @!DOW :( Voiceover) By night... @!Dr-GREER : Oh, look, look, look. Yeah, there it is. It sure is. @(Footage-of-people-) @!DOW :( Voiceover)... he is on mountain tops ; this time near the small town of Metepec in Mexico. @!Dr-GREER : Oh, God, this is the real McCoy. @(Footage-of-Greer) @!DOW :( Voiceover) Dr. Greer is the founder of a group looking for extraterrestrials. @!Dr-GREER : Where 'd it go? There it is. We have made the assessment that these are real -- these so-called UFOs are real. Why do n't we try to see if we can get their attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open way? @(Footage-of-Greer-a) @!DOW :( Voiceover) Unlike most UFO groups, this one does more than just study sightings. It wants diplomatic relations with extraterrestrials. @!Dr-GREER : They 're around tonight, friends. It 's neat, great. @!DOW : Do you think, Dr. Greer, that these intelligent beings know that you might be trying to make contact? @!Dr-GREER : Yeah, I 'm sure they do. These are put out to mark an area that we 've det -- determined in advance would be a good place to have a craft land or set down. @!DOW : What other gadgets do you have with you? @!Dr-GREER : Oh, we have a 35mm, we have a Canon L-1 Pro camcorder high eight. We 've got an electron -- electric field meter that picks up microwave. We have high-powered lights, microcassette dictation, compasses, radio equipment. Let me see this one. We have beeping tone that are tones that have been recorded in proximity of these craft when they 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beep, beep, beep. Those tones we are sending out like a beacon into space. Frequently they 'll come down over this pass and originate, and they come down the ridge line. qwq @( Footage-of-Dr. -Gre @!DOW :( Voiceover) When Dr. Greer and his group look for locations to set up camp, they do n't just look for the best view of the sky. @!Dr-GREER : The problem with this area -- there 's not a good landing site. Be a good place to have a meeting if one of these things lands. We can pull them back in here. @(Footage-of-group-m) @!Dr-GREER :( Voiceover) Like Steven Greer, the other members of the group have day jobs. Sheri Adamiak works in a law firm in Denver. Wayne Peterson is an engineer in Phoenix. And Marty Keller is a writer in Minneapolis. @!Dr-GREER : You can get a 150-feet diameter disk in this field. @!DOW : If this did happen, would you go aboard if they -- if invited? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without any hesitations at all? Any hesitation in your heart at all? @!Dr-GREER : This -- yes. That 's right. @!DOW : You 'd go? @!Dr-GREER : Yeah. I mean, you have to understand I -- I 'm serious enough about this that I have transferred e -- every asset I have into my wife 's name. I own nothing. @!DOW : The possibility exists that you may never be heard from again. @!Dr-GREER : It 's a possibility. I think it 's remote. @(Footage-of-Dow-wit) @!DOW :( Voiceover) Just in case... @!Dr-GREER : Just give your name and the na -- your name and the name of someone to contact and phone number into this. This will be a permanent record. @!Mr-WAYNE-PETERSON- : My name is Wayne Peterson and contact Grace Peterson. @!Ms-SHERI-ADAMIAK-@ : Sheri Adamiak, boarding party member number two -- communicator number two. @!Mr-MARTY-KELLER-@1 : Marty Keller, boarding party member number three, documentor number two. @!Dr-GREER : Steven Greer, I 'm the RIMT team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( Voiceover) They intend to leave the recordings behind for the rest of us. @!Dr-GREER :( Voiceover) Somebody will find them, they 'll play them back and they 'll see what happens. Oh, look. That may be it. That 's got no aviation lights on it. I do n't know why it 's lit up like that if it 's a normal airplane. Again, it was closer over here. It was silent and has no aviation lights on it. @!DOW : And what does that tell you? @!Dr-GREER : That tells me it 's a UFO. It went down below. I ca n't see it now. There it is. Here it is. @!Ms-ADAMIAK : All right. @!Dr-GREER : Put your strobe on. There 's something there. Oh, wow. @!Mr-PETERSON : I hit it with the light and it reflected off something. @!Dr-GREER : I mean, I hate to sound ridiculous but I think there 's a craft recon behind the ridge. It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to go with me? Wayne? @(Footage-of-Greer-s) @!DOW :( Voiceover) This close encounter turns out to be rather terrestrial. @!Dr-GREER : Do you hear that? @!DOW :( Voiceover) Party-goers celebrating a local holiday. @!Dr-GREER : We heard voices and -- and I heard someone kind of cough. Yeah, it 's -- it 's -- it 's -- see, look, there 's a figure. Ah, they 're laughing. Well, they 're people. That 's all we need to know. @(Footage-of-UFO) @!DOW :( Voiceover) But the team is not to be deterred. @!Dr-GREER : God, what is this? I think this may be the real thing. @!DOW :( Voiceover) Over the next six nights they have more than seven sightings. @!Dr-GREER : Yeah, there it is. @!Ms-ADAMIAK : Look. @!Dr-GREER : It sure is. Look at the size of that. @!Ms-ADAMIAK : Look at that. @!Dr-GREER : It 's moving towards the gap. @!DOW :( Voiceover) And once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh. @!Ms-ADAMIAK : Oh, what was that? @!Mr-PETERSON : What was what? @!Dr-GREER : It -- it -- it interacted beautifully, though, in terms of the off and on. I mean, that was -- that was incredibly good CE-5. In no way could a conventional craft move in a way where it could signal back and forth like that with the lights on and off. @(Footage-of-Dow-wit) @!DOW :( Voiceover) We brought our footage of the sightings to a group of scientists who are experts at analyzing film and videotape. @!Mr-BOB-FRANKLE-@1F : I have n't seen anything that -- that would indicate to me that these are extraterrestrial beings. @(Footage-of-McCarth) @!DOW :( Voiceover) Dr. Roger McCarthy and Bob Frankle were not impressed. @!Dr-ROGER-McCARTHY- : There 's been no movement in these pictures that would... @!DOW : It did seem unusual... @!Dr-McCARTHY : Unusual... @!DOW :... or unlike any aircraft that we use. @!Dr-McCARTHY : Not re -- out of the realm of aircraft power, you 're exactly right. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images... @!Mr-FRANKLE : What we 've done thus far is to take the frames of the video that you provided us and we 've digitized them. @!Dr-McCARTHY : You look at the shape here and the relative geometric location would n't be inconsistent with an aircraft that had a nose, fuselage top, wing tip and tail. @!DOW : Do you believe there 's extraterrestrial life out there? @!Dr-McCARTHY : There is, I think, no question that there is extraterrestrial life elsewhere in the universe. That they would come here, that they would come here with running lights and that they would come here with running lights that I ca n't tell from the other lights that I have running around the -- in the world, I find that highly improbable. @(Footage-of-people-) @!DOW :( Voiceover) Metepec, it turns out, is only 52 miles from the busy Mexico City airport. Unidentified Man 1 : If a spacecraft is landing or coming close... @!DOW :( Voiceover)... which may explain why it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Man 1 :( Voiceover) We have a -- a plan for going on board... @(Theme-music)
