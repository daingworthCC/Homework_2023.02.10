5001441 @1REP.--JOHN-RUTHERFORD@3 : Well, I was just going to say, the purchaser 's permit allows law enforcement to then go into that black market and buy and sell guns, and make arrests of the folks who are in there doing it illegally. @1DONALD-TRUMP-PRESID@3 : We 've got to be very tough on the black market. @1RUTHERFORD@2 : Exactly. @1REP.--STEPHANIE-MURPH@3 : Mr. President? @1TRUMP@2 : Yes, thank you. @1MURPHY@2 : I represent a district in central Florida, and we were deeply affected by polls. And I think in the aftermath of these types of tragedies, the American people really want to see us -- their elected leaders working together to do something. And so I 'm heartened... @1TRUMP@2 : Ultimately, this did n't happen after Pulse. I mean, how bad was Pulse? And nothing happened. @1MURPHY@2 : Well -- so thank you for bringing us all together. I have heard a number of ideas, and I wanted to present one that I had n't heard yet. I have a bipartisan bill to remove the so-called Dickey Amendment, which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CDC and other federal agencies from researching gun violence. And I think that your secretary of HHS has said he thinks we should be able to research gun violence. It 's a key piece -- having facts and scientific data is a key piece in helping us address this national public health issue. And so I would hope that -- you know, we as lawmakers can have opinions about policies, but we should all have good sets of facts. And it 's an easy fix. We just have to strike one sentence in the existing law to enable us to conduct the research that is much needed. @1TRUMP@2 : OK. Thank you very much. Guys, are we -- maybe we 'll sum up pretty quickly. Do you want to go really quickly? @1REP.--TED-DEUTCH-D@3 : I do. I -- only because Congresswoman Esty brought this up. I -- this is -- this is a bracelet that Marjory Stoneman Douglas has -- has been selling back home. I want to give it to you, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last one of these that we ever have to have... @1TRUMP@2 : Good, good. @1DEUTCH@2 : And, if we can do -- if we can do universal background checks and ban bump stocks and increase the age to 21 and get rid of the Dickey Amendment and do it now and show the American people and my constituents -- the people in Parkland, the grieving families and students -- that we 're actually ready to act, they 'll feel better. And you can get this done, Mr. President. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1TRUMP@2 : Thank you. OK. Thank you very much. Thanks. @1DEUTCH@2 : Thank you. @1TRUMP@2 : Thank you. So, if I could just sum up, Chris and John, Pat, Joe, maybe you could all get together and you 'll start it from that standpoint. Other people -- Dianne, you have some very good ideas. We all have -- I think everybody -- Marco, I know you have a lot. Fellows, if you could all get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation -- Chuck -- I think that you 're going to have an amazing result in the vote. And votes are hard to get in Congress. That 's what 's been happening. You 're going to have an amazing result. People are going to be shocked to see the numbers. It 's not going to be 60. It 's going to be way above 60. And it may be a number that nobody would even believe. People want to see something happen, but they want to see something good happen, too, not just another piece of -- I mean, you did n't pass anything, let alone some good stuff. We want to pass something great. And, to me, something great has to be where you stop it from happening. And I think there 's only one way. But, again, if you feel not to have that -- you understand -- I want a counter. I want a very strong counterpunch, because, if you have a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to have this problem anymore. Remember the 98 percent figure : 98 percent of these attacks -- gun free zones. No backlash. No death to them ; death to everybody else. But, if you four could get together and do something and maybe set the foundation, add to the foundation with some of the great things said, we would have -- we 're going to have a bill -- Steve, it 's very hard to add the one thing that you want. I mean, I will tell you. I 'm a fan. @1UNIDENTIFIED-MALE@2 : It 's still worth it. @1TRUMP@2 : I -- consider -- let 's consider it for a separate bill. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1TRUMP@2 : We 'll consider it for a separate bill. But, again, we also want things that can be approved. You have to look at the age of 21 for certain types of weapons. I mean, some people are n't going to like that, but you 're going to have to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a vote. I think it 's going to be a very successful vote. And I will sign it. And I will call whoever you want me to if I like what you 're doing. And I think I like what you 're doing already. But you could add to it. But you have to be very, very powerful on background checks. Do n't be shy. Very strong on mentally ill -- you have to be very, very strong on that. And do n't worry about bump stock. We 're getting rid of it. We 're -- it will be -- I mean, you do n't have to complicate the bill by adding another two paragraphs. We 're getting rid of it. I will do that myself, because I 'm able to. Fortunately, we 're able to do that without going through Congress. So, if the four of you could work together and come up with some beautiful foundation, add and subtract to it, put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what we have to do. @1SEN.--DIANNE-FEINSTEI@3 : Mr. President, what do we do about weapons of war easily accessible on our streets? @1TRUMP@2 : What you 're going to have to do is discuss it with everybody and any sort of -- no, it 's a very complex solution. You do. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1TRUMP@2 : You have -- you have weapons on the street. That 's what we 're talking about with black market. These are black-market weapons. You know, the problem, Dianne, is that these are n't where you walk into a store and buy. These are where somebody hands you a gun and you hand them some money. @1FEINSTEIN@2 : No, you go into a store and you can buy an AR-15. @1TRUMP@2 : You can. @1FEINSTEIN@2 : You can buy a TEC-9. I mean, you can buy all these weapons. @1TRUMP@2 : Well, this is what you 're going to have to discuss. Joe... @1FEINSTEIN@2 : Light triggers... @5CROSSTALK@6 @1FEINSTEIN@2 :... bullets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to have to discuss that. You 'll sit down with Dianne and everybody else and you 'll come up with something. And I think it -- I really believe it has to be very strong. I would rather have you come down on the strong side, instead of the weak side. The weak side would be much easier. I would rather have you come up with a strong, strong bill, and really strong on background checks. With that, I just will end it, but I just want to thank everybody. I really believe we 're going to -- we 're on the road to something terrific. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1QUESTION@2 : Mr. President -- Mr. President, could you see yourself... @1NEIL-CAVUTO-HOST@2 : All right, you have been witnessing something most unusual, my friends. Welcome. I 'm Neil Cavuto. You 're watching " Your World. " The president once again in a tour de force performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and giving some zingers back, and all on the issue how to avoid another Florida shooting, and peeving off both sides, oftentimes at the same table and sometimes with the same senators and congress men and women. That is leadership. These are examples of it just now. @5BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP@6 @1TRUMP@2 : It does n't make sense that I have to wait until I 'm 21 to get a handgun, but I can get this weapon at 18. I do n't know. So, I was just curious as to what you did in your bill. You do n't address it. @1UNIDENTIFIED-MALE@2 : We did n't address it, Mr. President. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1TRUMP@2 : You know why? Because you 're afraid of the NRA. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1TRUMP@2 : Yes. It 's a big issue right now. @1UNIDENTIFIED-MALE@2 : You 're right. @5END-VIDEO-CLIP@6 @1CAVUTO@2 : All right, and back and forth it went. That, again, is an indication of leadership, staying focused on an issue, zinging both sides. This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tweets and ribbing shots like this. " Why is A.D. Jeff Sessions asking the inspector general to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse? Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power, and already late with the reports on Comey, et cetera. Is n't the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use the Justice Department lawyers? DISGRACEFUL. " What he was essentially doing there is saying the guy on his team, his beleaguered attorney general, against whom he has had multiple such tweets and zingers, and that 's what he does to someone in his Cabinet, that 's what he does to someone on his side, that 's what he does to someone in his party. There are ways to do this. Then there are ways not to do this. Taking on Republican Senator Pat Toomey on guns? Well, that 's a good way to do it. Taking on your own Cabinet official and humiliating him internationally, on Twitter, no less, maybe that 's not the way to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conundrum, that is President Donald J. Trump. John Roberts at the White House following, well, I guess both presidents -- John. @5LAUGHTER@6 @1JOHN-ROBERTS-FOX-NE@3 : Good afternoon to you, Neil. Yes, you have got to kind of wonder, how much more can Jeff Sessions take? Because he was taking it on the chin from the president last spring, then last summer in the fall, and now into the winter. And the president getting some backup from his good friend the Reverend Jerry Falwell Jr., who suggested that Jeff Sessions is just a coward. This whole thing prompted Sessions, in a rare moment, to push back against the president. For the most part, he 's just taken it on the chin or turned the other cheek, but Sessions saying that he 's " initiated the appropriate process that will ensure complaints against the department will be fully and fairly acted upon if necessary. " He goes on to say : " As long as I am the attorney general, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " So we will see where the Sessions things goes. That 's all dealing with the Russia investigation, and then the inspector general 's investigation now that the DOJ has launched in the wake of this Republican memo and then the Democratic memo that came out on FISA abuses and the rebuttal to it. But what I thought was really interesting today was when the president looked at Steve Scalise and said, you know I love you, but if you try to put this idea of concealed carry reciprocity into the House version of the Cornyn-Murphy bill, that is not going to get passed. The president has got a whole series of measures that he 's going to unveil tomorrow. FOX News exclusively has obtained some of those details. Now, he will voice support for the Cornyn-Murphy bill. We know that, as well as the stop school violence bill. We do know that the president in the past has supported this idea of raising the minimum age for buying a long rifle from 18 to 21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a little bit over recent days. But he will include that. In addition, he is going to say, as he 's said before, that he will seek to by executive action ban bump stocks. But he 's going to take action, series of administration actions, expanding DHS program to stop school violence, fix the FBI tipster program, encourage more states to create laws for extreme risk protective orders, so that if somebody threatens themselves or others, their family or the law enforcement can go to court to get an order to take away their weapons. He 's going to put some meat on the bones in terms of this idea, Neil, of arming certain members of faculty and staff by proposing either federal grants or a federal training program to help get that done. So, big announcement coming from the White House on the set of -- series of policy proposals to make schools safer and to increase gun safety. So, we will be watching for that for you tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on there. John Roberts, thank you very, very much. @1ROBERTS@2 : Thank you. @1CAVUTO@2 : So, again, sort of a tale of two different presidents today, certainly on the gun issue, getting ahead of it and trying to get both parties on his side, and then that dust-up that continues with his attorney general, Jeff Sessions. But it 's a question that I raised with the attorney general 's old colleague, Alabama Republican Senator Richard Shelby, as to why Sessions puts up with it. @5BEGIN-VIDEOTAPE@6 @1SEN.--RICHARD-SHELBY-@3 : You need the support of the president when you 're the attorney general and when you 're the secretary state or when you 're the treasury secretary. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1CAVUTO@2 : Well, Sessions does n't have it. Sessions does n't have it. @1SHELBY@2 : Absolutely. And, you know, loyalty is a double-edged sword. If the president is loyal to him and vice versa, you generally have got a smooth relationship. But you have got a troubled relationship there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I listened to your program a minute ago. I do believe that Sessions had no option, other than to recuse himself from the Trump investigation. I do believe... @1CAVUTO@2 : Most common thinking, law-abiding, just ethically... @1SHELBY@2 : Had to. @1CAVUTO@2 :... right men and women would concur with that. @1SHELBY@2 : I agree. @1CAVUTO@2 : It is -- it 's over. It 's done. But he 's held this grudge since. And I guess -- and I can understand he 's frustrated. He felt like that that led to a chain of events, and here we are. But do you think, Senator... @1SHELBY@2 : Well, we 're where we are right now. @1CAVUTO@2 : Right. @1SHELBY@2 : But I also believe that, when the special prosecutor was appointed by the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, to investigate the Trump campaign and so forth, that would have been an opportune time to appoint a special prosecutor investigate the Clinton shenanigans and the Clinton Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States and the former president of the United States, all of that, it should have been done a year ago. But it wasn't. @1CAVUTO@2 : Yes, well, would have, should have, could have. I agree. But there 's a lot of things that could have, should have happened, to your point. I 'm just wondering what happens now. If you 're Jeff Sessions, why do you stay in office? Why do you stay attorney general? @1SHELBY@2 : That 's the question of the day right now. Do you stay, although... @5CROSSTALK@6 @1CAVUTO@2 : Would you? If it were you? If it were you, Senator, in that capacity, would you stay? Would you be humiliated and happily humiliated day in and day out? @5CROSSTALK@6 @1SHELBY@2 : Oh, absolutely not. I would n't stay at all, unless the president wanted me to stay, and he appointed me. I would n't be under anybody 's -- I would n't be anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the president is saying you do n't have any confidence in me. So, that is Jeff 's challenge right now, and what he wants to do and how he does it. And he 's a good man. He 's going through a lot and he has got a lot of challenges. @1CAVUTO@2 : Is there a spillover effect of this, Senator, among some of your colleagues, who feel, wow, this is how he 's treating a member of his own Cabinet and whatever you think of the wisdom of what he 's saying or what -- and why Jeff Sessions did what he did when things started or looking into this investigation now and the inspector general, et cetera, say, you know, there but by the great of God go I? And so I 'm thinking that this guy is like, you know, a machine gun, that he 's going to come after me next. What do you think? @1SHELBY@2 : Nobody knows. We all could speculate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be up to whether the attorney general wants to stay in the job and be belittled by the president, his boss who put him there, or does he want to leave. That 's a decision he will have to make. @1CAVUTO@2 : Do you think it 's having an effect on some of your legislative priorities or working or getting even Republicans to work on -- either on gun legislation or safety legislation or any one of the other issues, infrastructure, that are popping up? Are they feeling right now the president could abandon them or that they -- he wo n't be loyal if they go the extra mile? @1SHELBY@2 : Well, there 's always the question, will people who propose things be with you at the end? Will they be with you when it 's -- going gets tough? And that 's part of legislation that we deal with every day. So, we will have to wait and see. @1CAVUTO@2 : Do you trust this president to do the right thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, including yourself? @1SHELBY@2 : Well, I would hope so. We all respect the office of the president. We want to appreciate what the president is doing and how he 's doing it. I do believe that the president has made some good decisions overall. Look at our economy, a lot of appointments he 's made, a lot of the savings he 's made, but loyalty is a two-way street in a Cabinet position. We know that. I 'm sure the president knows that and the people who take those jobs know that. @5END-VIDEOTAPE@6 @1CAVUTO@2 : Loyalty is a two-way street. Well, the judge is with us now. And he thinks the president is right to criticize his attorney general, maybe just not the way he went about it i. @1ANDREW-NAPOLITANO-F@3 : Well, I wish that the president had picked up the phone and said, Jeff, here 's how I would like you to do it. But that 's not this president 's style. @1CAVUTO@2 : Right. @1NAPOLITANO@2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knows Senator Sessions, Attorney General Sessions, very well, far better than I know him. @1CAVUTO@2 : Are you surprised, Judge, we have touched on it before, this -- that he 's still sticking it out, that Jeff Sessions is sticking it out? @1NAPOLITANO@2 : Yes. I am surprised. @1CAVUTO@2 : Why do you think he does? @1NAPOLITANO@2 : I am surprised, because he 's submitted, we believe, we believe, two letters of resignation, both of which were summarily rejected by the president. And, arguably, the president 's public criticism today would be the impetus for a third one. But, Neil, I agree with you, I agree with Senator Shelby, I agree with the prevailing legal opinion that the A.G. had to recuse himself. But it was known before he was appointed attorney general that the FBI and the DOJ were investigating Russia influence. @1CAVUTO@2 : Right. @1NAPOLITANO@2 : He probably should have said to then president-elect Trump, I want this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I can do it because I think I 'm going to be a witness. That would have... @1CAVUTO@2 : He would have had to recuse himself. And the president would never have appointed him. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1NAPOLITANO@2 : The president would never have appointed him. And all the president 's angst that he feels to this very moment would have gone away. @1CAVUTO@2 : And that 's been the bubbling cauldron since, right? @1NAPOLITANO@2 : Yes. @1CAVUTO@2 : Now, this latest issue he 's taking him to task on, what did you make of that? @1NAPOLITANO@2 : Well, you know, the I.G., the inspector general, who has begun this investigation, is not an investigation of whether or not crimes were committed, but whether not DOJ, Department of Justice, regulations were violated. This I.G. is a good guy. Yes, he was there in the Obama administration. He was also there in the George W. Bush administration. He 's very much a straight shooter. But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth to it, an FBI-DOJ investigation, by eight or nine months to a year. That is what is frustrating to the president. @1CAVUTO@2 : Dumb question, but you endure many of these from me. @5LAUGHTER@6 @1CAVUTO@2 : Why would the president risk a situation where, let 's say, he forces Sessions out? Rod Rosenstein would advance in the interim, right? The chances of getting a new attorney general approved any time soon, I do n't think it would happen this year. But the environment would be beyond toxic. @1NAPOLITANO@2 : Toxic. The environment would be toxic. @1CAVUTO@2 : So, does he think that through? @1NAPOLITANO@2 : I do think he thinks that through. And I think he understands that. I think the people around him understand that. I think General Kelly understands it. I think Don McGahn, very, very bright lawyer, who is the president 's White House counsel, understands that. And I think the president 's lawyers, his personal lawyers, understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provoke Democrats and moderate Republicans to wonder what is going on between the president 's ears that he would fire an attorney general in an environment like this, especially an attorney general whose hands are clean. He may not be doing what the president wants, but there 's no professional criticism of Jeff Sessions. @1CAVUTO@2 : But he must really want this job to put up with this, that is, Jeff Sessions. @1NAPOLITANO@2 : Yes. @1CAVUTO@2 : Or maybe he 's just in over his head. What is it? @1NAPOLITANO@2 : I believe he 's not in over his head. As I mentioned to you earlier on your FBN show this afternoon, I believe, by temperament, by experience, by intellect, and by education, he 's absolutely qualified to be attorney general. But he gives the impression, the impression that he does n't belong there or does n't want to be there. @1CAVUTO@2 : So all his underlings of any party, do they wonder what is up? @1NAPOLITANO@2 : I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Justice, and the A.G. is making big policy and giving big policy speeches, but is not managing the day-to-day decisions, not making the, we will prosecute this person, we wo n't prosecute that person, the type of decisions that all of his predecessors made. It gives that impression. I hope I 'm wrong, because I like him and I want him to succeed. But the impression is out there. And it 's not just me. It 's in the legal and judicial community at large. @1CAVUTO@2 : Why, if it looks possible -- and I have heard these same reports that Sessions has offered his resignation, at least once, maybe twice -- why do n't you think the president took it? @1NAPOLITANO@2 : Because I think he knows it would be an explosion that he does n't need. It would add to his political woes and would actually pry loose moderate Republicans in the Senate who are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt would start talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this? @1CAVUTO@2 : The residual damage is what? @1NAPOLITANO@2 : Another impetus for impeachment. I hate to say that, but that 's where the residual would be if Jeff Sessions were to be fired against his will in this environment. @1CAVUTO@2 : Would you put up with this if you were Jeff Sessions? @1NAPOLITANO@2 : I would like to think that I would, but I do n't know. There 's limits to human endurance. @1CAVUTO@2 : Judge Andrew Napolitano, one of the finest legal minds I know anywhere, anywhere. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1NAPOLITANO@2 :... hear you say that. @1CAVUTO@2 : I know. He 's so envious of you. He 's says you 're the Italian getting all the attention. @5LAUGHTER@6 @1CAVUTO@2 : And he does n't like it. All right, just want to let you know here, we 're not remiss here. And we were showing you in the lower right corner, that 's right, another big sell- off today on top of the nearly 300-point one yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a 10-month winning streak right now. But it 's giving back here, and our markets now from those highs of certainly in February. The sell-off was pronounced across the board. And from those highs in the correction, we have made up about half the ground, but, again, we were back to within about 3 percent of the old highs. Not anymore. We will have more after this. @5COMMERCIAL-BREAK@6 @1CAVUTO@2 : All right, the president making it very clear he 's still not too pleased with his attorney general. The question I have is why the attorney general still stays on. Apparently, we 're getting reports that he had offered his resignation a couple of times. The president has either declined it or they thought better of it. Whatever the case, it 's an awkward relationship. What is it about that job, the pressures or the conundrum right now it has put Jeff Sessions in? Let 's ask a fellow who held that job, the former attorney general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, very good to have you. @1MICHAEL-MUKASEY-FOR@3 : Good to with you. @1CAVUTO@2 : What was it like working for President Bush? Did he ever have differences with you? Did he ever publicly say anything bad about you? @1MUKASEY@2 : We had a couple of differences. He never publicly said anything bad about me. We -- whatever differences we had were resolved internally. He was, after all, the president. I lost a couple. I won a couple. @1CAVUTO@2 : Did they get heated? Did you ever offer to resign? @1MUKASEY@2 : No. No, not nearly. @1CAVUTO@2 : OK. @1MUKASEY@2 : Not nearly. @1CAVUTO@2 : What do you think of this relationship? What is going on here? @1MUKASEY@2 : Look, I 'm not -- I 'm not an expert on relationships. I 'm a lawyer, not a psychologist. @1CAVUTO@2 : All right. But when the president is constantly second-guessing you -- and it might be his right -- it might just still be burnt and angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never, never calmed. And this latest opinion of the president about the way Sessions handled this whole FISA thing, what did you think of that? @1MUKASEY@2 : I think it 's wrong. @1CAVUTO@2 : Who is wrong? @1MUKASEY@2 : The president is wrong. And he does n't know his own interests. @1CAVUTO@2 : Explain. @1MUKASEY@2 : The fact is that the I.G. is the person who should investigate this. @1CAVUTO@2 : The inspector general. @1MUKASEY@2 : Yes, the inspector general is the person who should investigate this. @1CAVUTO@2 : Even though the president says, oh, that 's an Obama guy. @1MUKASEY@2 : Obama guy, my foot. He was there in the George W. Bush administration. He was an Obama appointee, but he 's straight as the edge of that table. He 's a serious person who investigates things on the merits. And he 's investigated other things on the merits that he will conclude when he concludes. Mike Horowitz is a suburb I.G. And I think pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to get into machinations of... @1MUKASEY@2 : I mean, there 's no... @1CAVUTO@2 : Go ahead. @1MUKASEY@2 : You do n't -- you conduct an investigation of the sort that the president was talking when there 's evidence of a crime. There is n't. So, there 's no crime to investigate. The I.G. is the person to investigate whether rules and procedures were followed. If he unearths something that smacks of criminality, there will be plenty of time to investigate it. @1CAVUTO@2 : OK. Now, let 's say he were to leave. That is, Jeff Sessions were to leave, for whatever reason, I ca n't deal with it, or he 's forced out. @1MUKASEY@2 : He has job -- if there 's anybody in this world who has job security, he is a person who has job security, because the person who would succeed obviously is Rod Rosenstein. @1CAVUTO@2 : Right. @1MUKASEY@2 : Right. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1CAVUTO@2 : And finding a successor, a permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @1MUKASEY@2 : I will say. @1CAVUTO@2 : Yes. So, the legal fallout from this back and forth, it 's generally never advisable to have a public dispute. But do you know at the Justice Department how this is all falling out? Is it a big deal? Are they used to it? What? @1MUKASEY@2 : I do n't know for a fact, because I 'm not there. I ca n't imagine that it helps morale to hear about squabbles going on at the department where you work. But I think that the attorney general and the people who work at the department who are serious-minded people do on a daily basis what they should do, which is to keep their heads down, do their jobs, and try to call things the way they see them. And as far as I know, that 's what 's doing on at the department now. Certainly, that 's what Jeff Sessions is doing. @1CAVUTO@2 : You know, General, I think it 's probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, because, though you 're appointed by the president, you serve the people, as do all Cabinet secretaries. But the legal issues come to the fore when the president does n't think that you 're necessarily serving his interests and you 're -- you 're acting against those interests. How did you handle that? What did you -- just about your day-to-day handling of the job? @1MUKASEY@2 : I handled it by responding and making my case. And, as I said, I won a couple, I a lost a couple. If the president tells you to do something, and it 's within the limits of the law, even if you think it 's bad policy, you do it, because the president sets policy. If you think it 's outside the limits of the law, and the president tells you do it, you say no. And either the president fires you, or you leave. But I do n't think that we 're at that point with Attorney General Sessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, is this public criticism, which I do n't think is good for anybody. @1CAVUTO@2 : Why does it continue, though? Would you put up with that, if it were you? Just -- I know it 's different with President Bush. @1MUKASEY@2 : I ca n't... @1CAVUTO@2 : Would you put up with that? @1MUKASEY@2 : I ca n't put myself in Jeff Sessions ' place in this administration. This is very different from what it was like when I was there. If the president had said something about me in public of the sort that this president has said about Jeff Sessions, it would indicate deep dissatisfaction. @1CAVUTO@2 : And you would offer your resignation? @1MUKASEY@2 : Yes, of course. I would have taken it to heart. But it would have been preceded by a great deal that I do n't think preceded this. @1CAVUTO@2 : A lot have said that this president, he is new to the job, does n't know even about maybe the role of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know, do anything illegal or anything else, but he had read into this loyalty, this is all about loyalty to the president. How do you juggle that as attorney general of the United States, appointed by the president of the United States, serving for the president of the United States, serving the United States? @1MUKASEY@2 : Look, the A.G. is a member of the administration. So, he 's got to follow the policy of the administration. But his job is to advise the president on what the limits are of the law, what the law allows at both ends. And then the president makes the choices between those limits. I think President Bush well understood that. And the notion that somehow the A.G. is the president 's lawyer is wrong. The president has lawyers. He 's got White House counsel. @1CAVUTO@2 : But on this issue, where -- on this issue, where Sessions decided, I 'm going to have an I.G. look into -- handle this whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, you 're saying that Sessions was within his rights, this is the right route to take? @1MUKASEY@2 : It 's the right route to take. It 's also the correct route to take. It makes a lot... @1CAVUTO@2 : As it was back in the very beginning, when he recused himself. @1MUKASEY@2 : Right. @1CAVUTO@2 : That he was in the legal right there, two actions that the president deems unacceptable. @1MUKASEY@2 : Right. The answer to that is, tough. @1CAVUTO@2 : OK. Attorney General, very good seeing again. All right, it 's hard to believe it 's been two weeks now, two weeks ago today, in fact, that students in Parkland were fleeing that school. What we have been learning since and how it could have been much, much worse. @5BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP@6 @1UNIDENTIFIED-FEMALE@2 : It was a very difficult day seeing -- being back on campus, seeing all the emotions. But seeing the support of everybody just made it feel better. @1UNIDENTIFIED-FEMALE@2 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this tragedy. We want to be defined by how much love and support we all give each other. @1UNIDENTIFIED-MALE@2 : It 's just bringing everybody together, like we 're Douglas, we 're strong, we 're going to get through this. @5END-VIDEO-CLIP@6 @5COMMERCIAL-BREAK@6 @1CAVUTO@2 : All right, well, he might have problems with a certain Cabinet member, but he did n't seem to have too many problems with Democratic senators and representatives and Republicans gathering at the White House today. He zinged them all, but he seemed to get progress from all -- after this. @5COMMERCIAL-BREAK@6 @1CAVUTO@2 : Two weeks to the day after the attack went down, students in Parkland, Florida, returning today. The read and how it went today from our own Matt Finn, who joins us in Parkland -- Matt. @1MATT-FINN-FOX-NEWS-@3 : Neil, you can imagine how gut-wrenching it is for the faculty and students who saw their friends or their colleagues being murdered in these halls. And today they had to return to this campus to finish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the district says it 's working with students and faculty who find it just too emotionally difficult to finish the year here. About 25 people have requested to be relocated, and the district says it 's cooperating with them. Today, we spoke with a students who returned to school for the first time after the massacre and also a father whose daughter was murdered at Stoneman Douglas behind me. Here 's what they had to say. @5BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP@6 @1BRADEN-FRIEDKES-STU@3 : A lot better. At first, a little nervous. I was calling like a lot of my family telling them I do n't want to go back. But coming back, it feels amazing. It 's a lot better. @1ANDREW-POLLACK-FATH@3 : She got murdered right in the building over there, not just -- like brutally murdered. Like, that officer who did n't go in, my daughter was shot four times. And then he stalked, went down through the hallway, shooting injured on the floor. He shot her another five times. My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got it on film. She covered a freshman. And that animal brutally shot her five more times, and killed the girl underneath my daughter, too. @5END-VIDEO-CLIP@6 @1FINN@2 : As if that father 's account is not disturbing enough, there 's also new information about the shooter 's rampage. CBS Miami is reporting that the day Nikolas Cruz went on his rampage, he planned to use a vantage point on the third-floor stairwell. He attempted to make it a sniper 's nest by shooting out a door window, but the door had a hurricane-proof window. And it did not shatter. His gun then jammed. He abandoned the gun and fled the scene. Today, Governor Scott is continuing his tour across Florida, trying to encourage lawmakers here to vote yes on his $500 million massive plan. In that plan, he proposes that the state law be 21 years old to be in possession or purchase a gun. Also new today, the Florida House has subpoenaed all responding law enforcement agencies for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massacre. There 's a lot of rumors and allegations swirling here on the ground, Neil, about law enforcement 's reaction that day. We 're investigating it, and now the Florida House is as well -- Neil. @1CAVUTO@2 : Thank you very much, Matt. Very good reporting, my friend. In the meantime, I want to bring Florida Republican State Representative Chris Sprowls on this. And, Representative, thank you. I know you have been quite busy, especially today. Time is kind of running out for this legislative session in Florida, I think another week-and-a-half, if that. Do you think this can be done, what the governor wants to do, what has been agreed to at least on the broad strokes to do? @1CHRIS-SPROWLS-R-F@3 : I think it can be done, Neil, and I think it will be done. We have about seven or eight days here left in the legislative session. But, as you can imagine, this is our top priority for both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the clock to come up with a comprehensive package to protect our schools throughout the state. We passed that through its first and only committee, our Appreciations Committee, yesterday, and I expect it to be on the House floor this week. @1CAVUTO@2 : One of the features of this is getting more armed officers in schools, I think averaging one per 1,000 students in Florida schools. But given the experience that we 're learning happened in this particular school, where the deputy was outside the school and at least three others waited outside, does that worry you, that that does n't necessarily mean you address the problem, especially if some of the officers are the problem? @1SPROWLS@2 : I think that 's right. I think that that concerns every Floridian, certainly every parent who has a child in school, which is, Neil, why we came up with the marshal program, which allows school personnel to go through training to become sworn law enforcement officers, so that while our SROs on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of defense for our kids, they 're not the last line of defense. @1CAVUTO@2 : All right, Representative, thank you very, very much. We will watch this very closely. In the meantime, we 're getting some breaking news, that Hope Hicks is resigning as the White House communications director. John Roberts has more on this. What 's going on here, John? @1ROBERTS@2 : Good afternoon to you, Neil. It 's interesting that this comes a day after she spent about 10 hours with the House Intelligence Committee talking to them about everything that they wanted to speak about during the -- about the Russia investigation. Not answering a lot of questions, though, that occurred after the president took office. But I 'm told that she just wanted the get that testimony behind her. This was in the works long before that. She has been one of the president 's closest advisers. She 's been with him the past three years or so. To say that she almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think. She worked with the Trump Organization in the past. She was working with Ivanka and then she took on what was an unbelievably intense job during the campaign, where she was for a long, long time literally an army of one doing communications for the Trump campaign, before they scaled up and they brought a few more people on board. The president with laudatory words about her resignation from the White House. And we should point out, Neil, that she still continues to work here. This is not kind of like an you 're out the door sort of thing. It was her choice. She wants to go off and something differently. She will wrap up her time here at the White House, like other people are as well. One of the deputy chiefs of staff is slowly transitioning out of the White House as well. And then she will head off into the private sector. The president saying : " Hope is outstanding and has done great work for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they come. A truly great person. I will miss having her by my side. But when she approached me about pursuing other opportunities, I totally understood. I am sure we will work together in the future. " From Chief of Staff John Kelly : " When I became chief of staff, I quickly realized what so many have learned about Hope. She is strategic, poised and wise beyond her years. She became a trusted adviser and counselor and did a tremendous job overseeing the communications for the president 's agenda, including passage of historic tax reform. She 's served her country with great distinction. To say that she will be missed is an understatement. " And from Hope herself : " There are no words to adequately express my gratitude to President Trump. I wish the president and his administration the very best as he continues to lead our country. " I mean, she 's less than 30 years old. She 's 28 or 29. She was recently at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of them were involved in a relationship. And I went to her office shortly after that whole thing came down, Neil, and she was as poised as -- and professional as anyone could possibly be, despite what obviously had to be some sort of a personal blow to her. And, of course, you know the controversy surrounding everything professionally. She is -- now that she 's leaving, I will say it. She 's a remarkable, young lady who has had one of the toughest jobs on the planet and carried it out with grace and dignity -- Neil. @1CAVUTO@2 : The timing is interesting to me, John. And maybe, as to your point, this was in the planing, but she did testify on Capitol Hill, we 're told, yesterday, that sometimes she had to have little white lies to tell the president. What did she mean by that? How did she explain that? And did they play in role in any of this? @1ROBERTS@2 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it 's just -- it 's a matter of -- it had but rumored for some time that she and other people who are close to the president, who have been living this intense 24/7-365 lifestyle were going to seek opportunities outside of the White House. I mean, you know, to say that the job was of such an intensity that you ca n't do it for a long time is probably an understatement. I talked to many, many people here at the White House who literally have not taken family vacation. They work every weekend. And the level of intensity is such that it 's difficult to continue. So, I do n't know if that played into all of this. I have n't had an opportunity to speak with her about it. I do n't know if what you mentioned played into it at all. But, again, this is a young lady who, I will agree with Chief of Staff Kelly, is wise well beyond her years, mature well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best job she possibly could for this president and has now decided to leave the White House and move into the private sector, Neil. @1CAVUTO@2 : And, again, you might have touched on it, but I have a lot of voices in my head there. So, I apologize, my friend. That she is going to step down exactly when? It sounds like she 's staying on a little bit here, but what? @1ROBERTS@2 : Yes. We do n't know. For example, Rick Dearborn, who is one of the deputy chiefs of staffs, announced either in late November or early December that he was going to be leaving the White House. And he 's still transitioning out of the White House. He 's been here for more than a couple of months. So I do n't expect that she will be here for a couple more months. I would imagine that her tenure at the White House will probably be measured in weeks. But, yes, she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, nobody is escorting her off the premises today. Let 's just put it that way. @1CAVUTO@2 : It 's interesting. The reason why -- this starts on the same day, of course, you had this back and forth with the president over Jeff Sessions. And I do n't want to say panic there or a sense of insecurity there, but is there at least a sense of disarray there? What would you say? @1ROBERTS@2 : Well, this continued feud that the president has with Jeff Sessions is very curious. And this White House for the past 14 months has certainly been like a political version of " Game of Thrones. " Now, there 's a lot of politics in " Game of Thrones. " @1CAVUTO@2 : Yes. @1ROBERTS@2 : And something once described it to me, the early days of this White House, as a running gun battle inside the West Wing. @1CAVUTO@2 : All right. @1ROBERTS@2 : I think that has probably dissipated to some degree, but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @1CAVUTO@2 : John, thank you very, very much. I want to get the read from all this with Democrat Joe Manchin, of course, of West Virginia, and working to Pat Toomey to come up with a bipartisan arms measure. And I do know you have a vote to look forward to, Senator. So, I thank you for taking the time. @1SEN.--JOE-MANCHIN-D@3 : Sure, Neil. @1CAVUTO@2 : How did it go in the White House there today, and do you think you made some common ground? I mean, if you had even approaching the support you had last time, you 're very close to 60 votes. @1MANCHIN@2 : Right, with the president 's support. And here 's thing. It comes down to this. I have always and will always support the Second Amendment rights. So does the president. And he knows we need to do some commonsense changes as far as in background checks. When people go to gun shows, they need to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Internet. He supports that. And I 'm tickled to death. And with his support, and both of us protecting the Second Amendment rights, we can move forward. And that 's what we intend to do. @1CAVUTO@2 : Do you think, when you say intend to do it, that this could be done in short order? The president said keep it simple, do n't do a lot of add-ons. There was talk about, even from Steve Scalise... @1MANCHIN@2 : Yes. @1CAVUTO@2 :... adding special measures for concealed weapons. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1CAVUTO@2 : What do you think of that? @1MANCHIN@2 : Yes. He knew the controversial things that really have a heavy lift, if you will. @1CAVUTO@2 : Right. @1MANCHIN@2 : But when you 're talking about the background checks, the Manchin- Toomey bill that we had in 2013, it was a good piece of legislation then, and it 's a good piece of legislation now. That 's the base bill he 's talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have better reporting. He wants to put in the mental illness part. We can address that. School safety, we had that in there. There 's some things that we can tweak and put in there. He said he 's getting rid of bump stocks on his own. That does n't need to be in there. He wants the age of 21. We will see if there 's support for the age of 21. It seems to me like it 's a no-brainer, because if it takes 21 years of age to buy a handgun, then he 's talking about AR-15s. If he just -- if they basically narrow that down to what firearm he 's talking about to raising the age, because there 's an awful lot of 18-year-olds who hunt and use for target practicing, sport shooting and all that, and very responsible. So, we will work through that. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1CAVUTO@2 : But are you against raising the age? He noticed that difference between 21 for a gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I think -- I think that 's a no-brainer for me. I do n't have a problem there. @1CAVUTO@2 : OK. @1MANCHIN@2 : But, also, there might be a caveat where we can carve out, which is what you do when you compromise, that if a person at 18 years of age wishes to have an AR-15 and it 's legally sold, then that person would have to go certain types of steps and tests and competency, showing that they 're adequately trained and responsible to use this type of a weapon. So that could be done. But we have heard talk of that. We 're willing to talk to anybody about whatever they want to, to come up with an all- inclusive piece of legislation. So, the Manchin-Toomey bill we had will be the base we will work off on. John Cornyn and Chris Murphy and everybody that wants to work with us, hopefully, we can make one good piece of legislation that can get through. @1CAVUTO@2 : As you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communications director of the White House, is resigning. @1MANCHIN@2 : Yes, I did. @1CAVUTO@2 : Obviously, it occurs at a very unique and critical moment here, to communicate the message on getting all this out that you want to get out. What do you think of what is going on at the White House right now? @1MANCHIN@2 : I really -- I was just there. And I met afterwards, Pat and I and John Cornyn, and went into the room with the president. And Mr. Kelly, General Kelly was there, and talking about how we move forward and we will work together and we want to make sure the president is on board. And I said, if the president is on board, knowing that he 's going to protect the Second Amendment, the same as I am going to protect it, and Pat Toomey and everybody else, we can get something rational reasonably done. @1CAVUTO@2 : Was Hope Hicks there when you were there by any chance? @5CROSSTALK@6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would have communicated that. @1MANCHIN@2 : I did n't see her there. No, I did not. So, I just heard about this walking in. This is the first time I have heard about it. @1CAVUTO@2 : Yes. All on the same day, as you know, Senator, the president and his attorney general are at loggerheads again. What do you think of that? @1MANCHIN@2 : Well, there 's a lot going on. It 's a lot to digest, I understand. But it seems like they -- this is the modus operandi. This is how they operate. And he 's able to function through that. So, everyone has their own style and their own comfort level. @1CAVUTO@2 : You sound surprised. @1MANCHIN@2 : A little bit unusual. @1CAVUTO@2 : Yes. Your colleagues and what they make of all of this,. How willing are they to help out on a gun measure, particularly Democrats who might think that Republicans are not giving up enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them what? @1MANCHIN@2 : I would say this. And I have said this before. I know they wanted to go much further than what my bill and Toomey 's bill went in 2013. But we have to bring people together to get 60 votes. It 's the art of the compromise working in the Senate. And we have a piece of legislation. And I have said this very candidly. If President Trump would have been president in 2013, when this piece of legislation was first introduced, we would n't be having this conversation. We would have passed it. Because of President Obama, people are a little bit concerned, and they were believing that he would n't protect their Second Amendment rights or was n't as supportive of the Second Amendment rights as hard as they wanted it to be. They were scared, well, if you pass this one, Joe, even though it makes sense, we 're gun owners, we like it, it 's OK, we think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will do more. He will take more. They do n't believe that with President Trump. And that 's why it 's important to have his support. @1CAVUTO@2 : Senator Manchin, thank you very, very much. @1MANCHIN@2 : Thank you, Neil. Appreciate it. @1CAVUTO@2 : Know it 's been a busy day for you. Thank you. @1MANCHIN@2 : Sure thing. Bye-bye. @1CAVUTO@2 : All right. All right, just to bring you up to speed on all of that, progress on the front here with weaponry and all of that and keeping our schools safer. But the big news just developing in the last few minutes is that Hope Hicks is resigning as communications director at the White House, this on the same day there 's been a back and forth with the president and his attorney general yet again, but a lot of craziness going on here. The Federalist 's Bre Payton -- Payton, I should say -- Democratic strategist Jessica Tarlov and American Majority CEO Ned Ryun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told this was something planned prior to her appearance before a congressional committee yesterday. What do you think of this? @1NED-RYUN-PRESIDENT@3 : I mean, at a certain point, Neil, this is a grind. And she 's been with the Trump campaign and then in the White House for, what, over two years now. So, I think, at some point, it 's just human nature to say I 'm getting out. I have had enough of the crazy lifestyle. At the same time, I do n't see this as a bad thing, Neil. I think Mercy Schlapp, who has been the deputy White House coms director, has really been, in theory, the real White House coms director. So I think this is really, I would hope, a good situation where Mercy becomes the real White House coms director. And you will just see, again, a professionalizing of some of the staff where -- when Sarah Sanders came in as press secretary, I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you put Mercy in as the White House coms director officially, I think that would also stabilize it. So in some ways, this is just kind of the nature of the beast. And in some ways, it 's a good thing to get things shaken up a little bit and move in a new direction. @1CAVUTO@2 : Bre, I 'm looking at this and these developments. If there was just utter confusion and chaos at the White House, the president did have a kind of funny way of showing it in his meeting with Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress. He seemed pretty focused on the pros and cons of putting this or that into this -- whatever legislation they come up with. How is this going to affect the White House, do you think, in the interim? @1BRE-PAYTON-THE-FEDE@3 : I do n't think that this was a surprise. Donald Trump and Hope Hicks have a very close relationship. He calls her by nicknames. He calls her Hopester. I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while. And I think that she probably had been drafting a statement ever since news broke about Rob Portman( sic) and that whole scandal several weeks ago. So, I do n't think that this set Donald Trump off his game or anything like that. I think he saw it coming quite a ways away. And it seems like he 's giving her his blessing. @1CAVUTO@2 : All right, Jessica, I think right now, since a lot of people are just absorbing this Hope Hicks news in the context of what was going on today, a classic example of that is just hearing how Chuck Schumer is responding to this, saying he 's encouraged by these developments and commending the president for meeting with disparate members of Congress. @1JESSICA-TARLOV-DEMO@3 : Right. @1CAVUTO@2 : Will that win the day? Or will this drip, drip of White House personnel who are either going or being told to go, not the case here, we 're told, but how is this going to play out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes. We have seen a lot of people who were incredibly important to the Trump campaign head out the side door, with Steve Bannon. Obviously, this is happening now. And think Bre is completely correct that if the Rob Porter scandal had not happened, I 'm not sure that this resignation would have been coming today. And we had the news yesterday where said she, sometimes, I tell white lies for the president, which, even if that 's true, I think you 're not supposed to say. @5LAUGHTER@6 @1TARLOV@2 : I hope that the focus continues to be on gun control. And I 'm very heartened to hear that have 200 bipartisan sponsors of a bill in the House, even if it does n't go as far as many Democrats would want, as Joe Manchin said there in your earlier interview. I thought it was great when the president said to Senator Toomey, you 're just scared of the NRA. He is definitely is just scared of the NRA. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what is going to happen about this due process issue that he said the guns should have just been taken away. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1CAVUTO@2 : By the way, he also called out some Democrats there on their opposition to something that would -- bump stocks. @1TARLOV@2 : Oh, it 's equal sides there. @1CAVUTO@2 : You name it, right? @1TARLOV@2 : I just thought that was particularly funny, and of his own party. But I 'm hopeful here that we... @1CAVUTO@2 : You have a particularly unique sense of humor then. @1TARLOV@2 : Oh. @5LAUGHTER@6 @1CAVUTO@2 : I 'm kidding. I 'm kidding. But, Ned, what I want to know, though, on this, when you hear -- because I said at the outset of this show that there 's two Donald Trumps, the very presidential one who today was very focused and dealing and fast on his feet on this issue, on this gun issue, then the tweeting or the snide Trump, who takes every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of his own Cabinet official, will bring it out to the whole world, tweeting it. I hope the former wins out. @1RYUN@2 : That 's right. @1CAVUTO@2 : But in light of this constant, what seems like an upheaval within his staff, I 'm not sure it will. What do you think? @1RYUN@2 : No, you see some of his best moment when he had that great immigration debate, brought everybody down to the White House, had a great conversation, again, this conversation on the guns, trying to bring everybody in the same room, very presidential, showed great leadership. @5CROSSTALK@6 @1CAVUTO@2 : Yes, but, Ned, on that one, he said that he -- if they came to an agreement, he would sign it. They came to an agreement, and he did n't sign it. @1RYUN@2 : Yes, but... @1CAVUTO@2 : So, how sure are you -- I know there were different -- I grant you. @1RYUN@2 : There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : But how sure are you that -- how sure are you that he will stick to his word on this, they come up with some broad plans here, and he would sign that, support it? Or some fear he will back away from it. @1RYUN@2 : Well, I think if it comes down to tightening up the background checks -- I think there 's people that are ambivalent about raising the age from 18 to 21. I 'm not sure how many people are going to really fight on that issue. I think, if you hit some of those main points, absolutely he will sign it. If it goes too far, he wo n't. I think so you have to see how this plays out. But I think there 's a willingness for people to go and say, hey, if you fix the background check problem, which is a real problem, and a couple of these other things, I think there will be a bill that he could sign and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neil, sorry. When they brought that proposal to him, that was nowhere near what was being discussed in the meeting in the White House. So, he was right to take a pass on it and say, no, you missed the parameters I laid out for you. @1CAVUTO@2 : Lindsey Graham says it was. But you 're right. I was n't there. I do n't know what it was. But that was then, this is different now. But, Bre, I do want to ask you this. Much has come up about this White House demanding loyalty. It was something you would hear from Hope Hicks. It was something you would hear from the president himself. Every president demands that. That is understandable. This president seems to take it to a new level. And these battles back and forth with his attorney general might indicate that. Is that something that we should watch closely? Because it 's very different when you 're talking about that from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but once appointed and once in that job has a far, far bigger role. @1PAYTON@2 : Yes, I have heard a lot about this absolute loyalty from people who I know personally that have gone through kind of the process with working with this White House. Some ended up working with this administration. Some ended up not working with this administration. And I definitely agree with you that it is a little bit of a head-scratcher there, that -- this idea that you ca n't have said a negative thing at all about the president, because then you will be thrown out, and you ca n't absolutely at all work with this administration, is a little bit much. @1CAVUTO@2 : All right. @1PAYTON@2 : However, I do think that the tweeting on Trump 's part this morning with Jeff Sessions is smart, because he knows that we 're all going to be talking about it all day long. He 's turning up the heat. He 's turning in the screws on Sessions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's not... @1CAVUTO@2 : No, no, you might be right. Jessica, is that going to work? @1TARLOV@2 : No. @1CAVUTO@2 : I mean, there are all sorts of ways to work the message and get it out. What do you think? @1TARLOV@2 : No, I do n't think so at all. And you were bringing this up in the earlier part of your show, and with your former Attorney General Mike Mukasey here. It 's just not how you treat someone who is in your Cabinet. I mean, Jeff Sessions was with him from the beginning, when people were saying, eh, no, I 'm with real conservatives, I 'm with Ted Cruz, or maybe I 'm even with a mushy moderate like John Kasich. He was there by his side. And he was absolutely right to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. And I do n't understand why public humiliation of a Cabinet member is ever good policy, and now force Jeff Sessions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Well, we will see. The humiliation continues. @5LAUGHTER@6 @1TARLOV@2 : Always. @1CAVUTO@2 : No, nothing of that here. All right, guys, thank you all very, very much. @1TARLOV@2 : Thanks a lot, Neil. @1CAVUTO@2 : Again, to let you know and bring you up, Hope Hicks, the communications director, very young communications director, is stepping down on the day stocks were down, on the day we finished one of our worst months in some time. Trading resumes tomorrow.
