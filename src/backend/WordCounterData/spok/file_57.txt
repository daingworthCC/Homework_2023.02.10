229741 @!CATHERINE-CRIER-H : Today divers located the bodies of John F. Kennedy, Jr., Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and Lauren Bessette in the waters off Martha 's Vineyard. I 'll talk to divers about the mission. Henry Kissinger joins me, as well. But first a check of the latest headlines. @(NEWS-BREAK) @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!JIM-HALL-NTSB-CHA : I know there are many people, including my family, who consider this a national tragedy. We all must remember, though, that this is an intense personal tragedy for the families. Our hearts go out to them. @!CRIER : Any glimmer of hope the Kennedy and Bessette families may have had over the past five days was sadly extinguished today with the recovery of the bodies of John F. Kennedy, Jr., his wife, Carolyn, and her sister, Lauren Bessette. FOX NEWS has confirmed that John F. Kennedy, Jr., will be buried at sea on Thursday. Officials say the arrangements are being made only for Kennedy, not for Carolyn Bessette Kennedy or her sister, Lauren. Senator Ted Kennedy went out to the crash site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all three bodies. Joining us now with the latest details is FOX NEWS 's Gary Matsumoto. Gary, what 's the latest? @!GARY-MATSUMOTO-FO : Catherine, the autopsies were scheduled to be performed this evening at the medical examiner 's office in Bourne, Massachusetts, which is just a few minutes ' drive from here at Otis Air National Guard base. As you 've reported, we understand from government officials that at least JFK, Jr., will be buried at sea tomorrow. We were told earlier in the evening by NTSB officials that the bodies were first positively identified by hard-hat divers before noon today, roughly around on a dive that took abut 40 minutes in waters 116 feet deep bodies, according to Rear Admiral Rick Larrabee of the Coast Guard, strapped in their seats in the fuselage. They had to lift the fuselage in order to remove the victims. Catherine? @!CRIER : When you say " lift the fuselage, " did they actually attach a - - bring the fuselage up and then -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would remove the machinery separately? @!MATSUMOTO : Our understanding, according to Admiral Larrabee -- and it 's a little bit unclear -- he did say they had to lift the wreckage up in order to remove JFK, Jr., Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and her sister. It was after they recovered the bodies that they brought to the surface this large portion of the wreckage that Admiral Larrabee described as being about 8 to 10 feet in length. He would not be drawn on any more details than that. @!CRIER : All right, well, there should be some of the instrumentation in that fuselage, but I would assume continuing diving to recover more portions of the plane to conduct the investigation. @!MATSUMOTO : Absolutely. Admiral Larrabee did say that the dashboard with all the instrumentation was intact in that piece of the wreckage that they brought to the surface. He also said that between, oh, 40 to 90 feet away from that big piece of debris were other portions of the plane. And he said they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USS Grasp some time over the next two days. @!CRIER : All right, one final question, Gary. With the pilot of an aircraft in an accident like this, I would assume the autopsy is mandatory by state law. What about the passengers? Is this something the families are opting -- the family 's opting to do? @!MATSUMOTO : We did not get details from the Coast Guard or NTSB about that, but we did see coroner 's vehicles take all three bodies to the examiner 's offices in Bourne, the assumption being the autopsies will be performed on all three. @!CRIER : All right, Gary Matsumoto, thank you very much. We 've got a lot more ahead on the investigation tonight. Do n't go away. &lt;22:06&gt; @(COMMERCIAL-BREAK) @!ADM-RICHARD-LARRAB : We put down our first divers at about 10:30 this morning. The first dive, a dive with two divers supplied by air from the surface, consisted of about 40 minutes on the bottom. And during that 40-minute period of time, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were looking for. @!CRIER : Their job may be complete, but to the divers who located the bodies and then brought them to the surface, this was one mission they 'll not forget. Lifeguard Systems, a company that trains scuba teams around the world in conduct these kinds of recovery missions. Welcome back. having me back. @!CRIER : Sure. Thanks so much for your time. I think it 's very important -- I think people are interested in how an investigation like this is conducted, but also whether it 's firemen or police officers, divers, others who do this sort of work, never get, I think, the attention and the appreciation that they ought to have. Tell us what the hard-hat divers would have done that had to go down and ultimately identify the bodies today. themselves for going down to look into the fuselage to see if there was anything there. They would have had an extreme briefing -- what to touch, what not to do. A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why did n't they just take him out? " Well, they had orders to get there, find out what was in it, look at it and decide from there. They 've also got to continuously deal with their personal safety. So for them to step into a position where they 're going to be doing something that could be reckless, so to speak, at 110, 120 feet -- we say " reckless " -- well, things happen very quickly, and you do n't have a lot of time to make decisions, so they plan a lot beforehand. They saw what was in there, came back, reported, and then a plan was made, and I 'm sure they looked for the very best current window, when the tides and water was going to be moving the least possible, and that 's when they were going to make their dive. @!CRIER : You talk about safety -- in addition to just the normal circumstances, you 've got jagged edges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. expect down there. Certainly, as you know, we said last night, it was -- as they moved around, they disturbed the bottom enough, the visibility that they did have would be even far, far less limited. They can get caught. There 's a whole lot of things. They also, as they start to move the umbilicals, these long hoses with air and possibly hot-water suits and communications systems through them, they 're very heavy, so they 've got a lot of work to move that hose going back to the surface that they live off of down there. @!CRIER : What about instructions -- you say not to touch, do touch -- because there is an investigation ongoing, and we talk about -- you know, I guess, criminally, I think forensics. But it is essentially forensics to reconstruct an accident, is n't it. be very careful on is that they do n't tear a door off without having taken pictures of it, if they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in there, do n't flip a switch. Do n't injure the physical property that we 're taking out -- and in this case, it was a human body -- any more than you can possibly move without physically hurting it because they want to see exactly what happened to those people before the divers ever touched them. @!CRIER : What sort of preparation -- because when you and I were talking last night, you said you really talk to divers about using their mind 's eye so that they are n't having to confront oftentimes horrific circumstances any more than necessary, and yet these divers were told " You must go down and identify. " So they 're having to make a close inspection, are n't they? alongside of that vessel. They 're going to have to look in the best they can, using some sort of lights. They had enough visibility that they did n't have back-scatter( ph) so that when the light was n't thrown back at them by the particles in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windows in order to make that identification. And at that point, it 's very difficult. You look at it -- you look in. You realize what you 're seeing. You stop. You catch your breath. You put your heart back in some sort of normal motion, and then you look again. And it 's at that look when you will never forget what you have now seen. The first look is that frightening look. The second time is what we call a " mind 's eye burner, " and it is -- it 's set. @!CRIER : You have a face that is with you to this day, do n't you. @!CRIER : A 14-year-old little girl. will never forget her. @!CRIER : How do divers do this time and again? we 've just tried to self-support or we walked away with, if you will, the seat-of-the-pants, macho type situation. Now there are incredible programs. There are incredible debriefing stress programs that are built into most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Many communities have access to very good college programs, where you can actually go in and get stress-related training and be able to be debriefed properly. And there 's certainly a lot of other little tricks that we do to try and help those divers. @!CRIER : Tell me about the activities now, at this point, because the bodies have been recovered, but there is still a lot of material on the ocean floor that the NTSB and others want to take a look at. They 'll go back to what they were doing originally in small areas, and they will basically just simply slice the bottom, and that may be with manpower or with a Rover, right? The sonar wo n't help them for the little pieces because of the debris everywhere. So it 'll become either a robot with a camera or divers literally just crawling across every inch they can find. They 're going to look for -- if they found a nut and bolt, they 're going to bring it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about -- about reconstructing and trying to determine whether or not it 's pilot error or whether there was a flaw in the machine which could lead, as we know, to liability lawsuits... @!CRIER :... and all sorts of things -- that literally, every -- every nut and bolt can make a difference. How long do you expect they will stay with a private, you know, single-engine plane like this to try and reconstruct? much time as they can to pick up as many major pieces, and then they 'll realize that they have enough, at some point. And I do n't know how they make that decision. But they 'll decide they have enough to now make that decision. And at that point, they may say, " OK, we 're going to stop. " But they will search probably for at least another 10 to 15 days and search every square inch that they can. @!CRIER : Yeah, again, last night you and I were talking -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 800? and then after that it was another 109( ph) days to pick up the final little pieces. But they had the majority of the pick-up within about 78 to 79 days. @!CRIER : And how many bodies were ultimately recovered? -- you know, I did n't know. @!CRIER : Were you surprised with an accident of this nature, with the dive this plane took -- and of course, the impact we anticipated -- that the bodies were recovered in the fuselage? @!CRIER : No? piece of fuselage, it was kind of an open door. It 's a small aircraft, and it was pretty( INAUDIBLE) saying well, there 's a very good chance that some of them are going to be in there. @!CRIER : If that piece was intact. @!CRIER : All right, well, Butch, you 're going to stay with us here for a couple of more segments. We 've got a lot more ahead. Do n't go away. &lt;22:16&gt; @(COMMERCIAL-BREAK) @!CRIER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just joining us, the bodies of John F. Kennedy, Jr., his wife and sister-in-law were recovered today from the waters off Martha 's Vineyard and transported back to land. Joining me now to discuss the search and recovery is Drew Skeke -- Ske -- excuse me -- Skeketee, right? @!DREW-STEKETEE-AIR : No, you try it. @!CRIER : Skeketee. Skeketee. @!STEKETEE : Steketee. @!CRIER : All right! All right, Steketee. Drew, I 'm going to get it right. I have butchered names before. I do n't like to do that. @!STEKETEE : Hey, it 's a test. @!CRIER : A senior vice president of communications at the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association -- he 's an experienced pilot who has flown the route between New Jersey and Martha 's Vineyard many, many times -- Dr. Alan Diehl, a former NTSB safety inspector, and still with me here in Welcome to you. Doctor -- welcome, Drew. Doctor, let me start with you. Something that I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the sequence of events -- how have the various investigative agencies put together the information about the airplane while it was still in the air? Was this radar traffic? @!ALAN-DIEHL-FORMER : Yeah, there 's been a lot of discussion about radar from the various radar centers that were, as they say, painting the aircraft. That 's what we knew about the flight to start with. @!CRIER : I think the question I have is if there was radar traffic, It 's no longer being tracked. But if by 10:00 o'clock, 10:05, that night, the FAA is contacted and told the plane that you were tracking and no longer -- assumedly, the plane landed... @!STEKETEE : It was n't tracked. @!CRIER :... but it did n't show up -- nothing happened. And this is n't to say anything could have been done, but why would n't there be a trigger and a follow-up if by 10:00 o'clock people are saying the plane did n't arrive? @!DIEHL : Well, what often happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-points bulletin every time a single light plane or a general aviation aircraft is a half an hour or an hour overdue. @!CRIER : But this is an aircraft... @!DIEHL : Had they been on a flight plan... @!CRIER : Right. @!DIEHL :... even a VFR flight plan, the FAA would have launched what the call a " ramp search " within 45 minutes of the arrival time. @!CRIER : OK, well, what -- the radar traffic, though, described a plane that was having difficulty making an appropriate descent, then banks, ultimately goes into a dive. Now, would this simply be recorded somewhere in a computer, as opposed to human eyes watching the gyrations, if you will, on a radar screen? @!DIEHL : Catherine, that 's exactly right. There 's an awful lot of blips, targets out there. This was what they call a VFR target. He was not being worked by any particular controller, and so he was just another blip on a screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only after the accident that they really started looking at the altitude read-outs. And of course, that 's not something that they have controllers sitting on scopes doing all the time. @!CRIER : OK, Drew, tell me about the activity of this pilot. Is it a situation where the NTSB or the FAA ought to say " Every general aviation pilot that goes out must now file a flight plan " or " You can not fly, unless you 're instrument-rated, after dark "? Is thee -- are there regulations ahead? Should there be? @!STEKETEE : Well, we 'll be talking to Congress for the first time tomorrow, but private pilots go on to get the instrument rating to fly routinely in clouds and in very bad weather. But even for the private pilot curriculum and examination, you 're taught to fly on instruments to extricate yourself from emergencies. And this pilot and any other private pilot had that training and passed that as part of his flight test. And I 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now, what was it? @!CRIER : Whether or not this sort of thing is necessary. But let me ask you about that because -- because... @!STEKETEE : Oh, flight plans. @!CRIER : Yeah. If you are not trained -- in other words, you do n't have your instrument rating... @!STEKETEE : Right. @!CRIER :... so you have not been rated on those, while under normal conditions you might feel comfortable trusting those instruments, in an emergency condition, that is very difficult for a new pilot to do, is n't it? @!STEKETEE : No. As I just said, the instrument rating is for routine operations in the clouds and bad weather all the time. But a private pilot, before he reaches that stage, just to get a private pilot 's certificate is trained on instrument flying so that he or she can extricate him or herself from emergencies. They are trained to go on instruments to return to straight and level flight. They are trained to reverse course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recover from unusual attitudes or loss of control. @!CRIER : OK, and what about the flight plans? Any necessity that all general aviation pilots should have to file them? @!STEKETEE : Yeah, that 's always a huge area of public misunderstanding. VFR flight plan has no air traffic control purpose at all. It is merely for search and rescue. But there are two other methods to do the same thing. One is to work radar flight following on the trip and actively talk to the controller and be tracked so they can see you if you are lost from the screen. And the other method used here is to advise relatives at the destination what time you 'll be there. @!CRIER : OK, and are you in favor, then, of requiring this? Because you certainly -- they 're going to be -- you know, those in this country that say " Not one more rule. We have the right to make this decision on our own, " but for public safety -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have had anything to do with the decision not to file a flight plan. @!STEKETEE : The flight plan has very little to do with it, and I feel safe using the other two methods, either using radar flight following or using the call to the relative. And in some cases, sometimes that 's faster than the VFR flight plan, in my opinion. @!CRIER : Doctor, what do you think about that? Because certainly, after a high-profile case like this, there 's going to be discussion of regulation. @!DIEHL : Well, there 's always the danger we may go into a knee-jerk reaction... @!STEKETEE : Absolutely. @!DIEHL :... and require something. If -- I think Drew would agree that the FAA probably does n't have enough controllers right now to handle the situation if every general aviation pilot demanded flight following or was required to get that after every flight. So hopefully, the NTSB will very prudently look at the situation. And months from now, after they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- or organizations like the AOPA to get their opinions before they do any rule-making. Catherine, one thing that was mentioned last segment I might want to clarify for you. @!CRIER : Sure. @!DIEHL : The question came up as to how many autopsies would normally be done. obviously, they always want the pilot done, and they -- normally, the NTSB requests an autopsy on anybody seated at a control. And of course, in light planes, the right -- the person in the right front seat also has a set of controls, so they would have needed to do at least two of those autopsies. @!CRIER : And of course, when you 're talking about an autopsy, in this case, primarily, I assume, toxicology results? @!DIEHL : Well, yeah. They 're looking for things like carbon monoxide, something as simple as that. And obviously, the more autopsies you do, the better reading you get on things like carbon monoxide. @!CRIER : OK. What about something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aircraft accidents, when they track pilot error -- and this is not to reflect on this case, I 'm talking about general circumstance -- that there is -- it 's not a -- simply an error of the mind, but a problem with the body, if you will? accidents and so forth, the majority, according to the National Safe Boating Council, deal with alcohol and drugs. @!CRIER : One would not expect -- Doctor, is that fair, that certainly, with the strict regulations for commercial pilots, and I would think reasonable pilots flying general aviation, that that would not be a typical problem? causes of fatal accidents. And as you probably have read, typically 70 percent of the accidents are called pilot error. But many times that 's a bit of an oversimplification. @!CRIER : OK, well, we want to talk more about that. Do n't go away. &lt;22:28&gt; @(COMMERCIAL-BREAK) @!CRIER : Welcome back. Talking about today 's developments in the Kennedy-Bessette tragedy. Let 's get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, who is just outside the Kennedy compound in Hyannisport. Hey, Eric. @!ERIC-SHAWN-FOX-NE : Hello, Catherine. Tonight history repeats itself. Another sad, final journey of a Kennedy is under way. Autopsy of John F. Kennedy, Jr., Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and Lauren Bessette also under way at the Bourne Medical Center. Then we 're told that John F. Kennedy, Jr., will be cremated, buried at sea tomorrow morning at 9:00 o'clock from a USS Navy destroyer, the USS Briscow( ph). This happens -- obviously, has happened very quickly. We 're told that the Kennedy family asked for a waiver from the Defense Department for this burial at sea. His ashes will be scattered miles out. They received that permission. The Defense Department says it does give that permission for people who, quote, " contribute to this country. " That offer has also been made to the Bessette family for the two sisters. No word if they have accepted that yet. We do know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11:00 o'clock in the morning in New York City, the Church of St. Thomas More. That 's where John 's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, often went for morning mass. It will be private, not open to the public, for the Kennedy the public or the media. And the next day, on Saturday, there 'll be a service that the Bessettes will hold in Greenwich, Connecticut, for Carolyn 's older sister, Lauren, who also died in the crash. Earlier today, Senator Edward Kennedy had the grim responsibility and the task to go out to the crash site and accompany the bodies back to the land. He went out there with his son, Patrick, who 's a congressman from Rhode Island, and from his other son, Teddy, Jr. They have now returned here to the Kennedy compound this evening. The senator and other family members obviously making the late-night arrangements for cremation and for the burial that will come up tomorrow morning. Catherine? @!CRIER : Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now continuing with Drew Sketetee -- Steke -- I 'm going to get it right, Drew, I promise! Steketee... @!STEKETEE : Thank you. @!CRIER : You 're welcome -- Drew Steketee, Dr. Alan Diehl and Butch Drew, let me ask you and the doctor something. In fact, I 'm going to let Butch describe this because we were talking about it during the break. Butch, your concern that divers -- there are underwater transponders to track divers and underwater -- explain what your concern is. diving under the ice in the Antarctic, we can put a transponder on a diver, even though he 's tied to a line. And if something does happen, I can use a transceiver and find him very quickly. It could be very possible to use the cooperative of two industries and take something perhaps made out of Delron( ph), takes very high-impact capability, put it into an aircraft with a pressure tensor( ph) so that it would physically activate after 30 feet or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under water and be recovered sound-wise -- sound waves -- through a transceiver very quickly. @!CRIER : I mean, Dr. Diehl, that seems to be pretty obvious, particularly in aircraft that are used over water. And of course, when it 's manufactured, you do n't necessarily know how it 's going to be used. Why is something like that not available? @!DIEHL : Well, I 'm sure that the industry could develop that. And even though recently, not just general aviation but all three or four of the last memorable crashes -- Swissair, TWA 800 and, of course, ValuJet -- have fairly rare. If it could be done cheap enough, I think it would certainly make sense. I 'm not sure all of AOPA 's constituents would agree. But certainly, it could be done. @!CRIER : You say the constituents might not agree? Drew, what would the objection be, just cost? @!STEKETEE : Well, Al, do n't -- let 's not prejudge. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that single-engine airplanes are used over land to the vast majority because they 're single-engine airplanes. They do not venture very far from the coast. And the public may not understand that Martha 's Vineyard island is very, very close to the coast of Massachusetts, and it is possible to fly a route to that island -- and this is why it 's such a pilot 's favorite. It 's possible to fly a route to that island from New York or Washington or the Boston area and never be out of gliding range of land. @!CRIER : What sort of instruction, Drew, does a young pilot receive about that very circumstance? Once you 've got that pilot 's license, I assume there is no restriction on the opportunity to set your own course. But what 's the training? @!STEKETEE : Well, you set your own course according to the training, and you 've been trained to plan and fly cross-country flights. You must actually do that during the course of your training, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight. @!CRIER : What is it, plan your flight and fly your plan? What 's the saying? @!STEKETEE : Yeah. @!CRIER : Yeah. @!STEKETEE : But you plan it out, and you fly it, and you 're actually tested when -- in your flight test, you 're actually tested on the ability to fly from point A to point B. @!CRIER : OK. Alan, is there any reason -- Doctor, any reason that, looking at the circumstances in this accident, that anyone should suspect problems other than the disorientation from the information that you have? @!DIEHL : Catherine, this is very, very early in the investigation. The radar track and the evidence we have to date, you know, suggests the possibility, perhaps the probability of disorientation. But certainly, the evidence is very, very marginal right now. When the diver was describing how important it was to recover parts -- I can remember a previous accident where a single bolt -- you know, it turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tail of the aircraft was the key to the whole accident, and NTSB did n't find it for six months. So we 've got -- we 're going -- unfortunately, there 's going to be a long period of weeks here of agonizing over this information. @!CRIER : Yeah, Doctor, certainly, we get the information today it may take six to nine months to evaluate. But you do n't necessarily recover all the parts all the time. How do you -- how do you ultimately come to a conclusion other than " This is probably what happened "? investigation organization in the NTSB. I should also mention I did work for the FAA for a number of years also. But the NTSB is the -- you know, the fair broker, and I think most people in the industry rely on their judgment. But as the chairman said today, they will determine probable cause. And it may well be because light aircraft, general aviation aircraft, do n't have black boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make some judgments. But you know it 's interesting, Catherine, that most accidents do involve some sort of judgment error. We did some studies when I was with the FAA, and over 52 percent of the general aviation fatal crashes involved judgment error. @!CRIER : Yeah. @!DIEHL : And they actually developed some prototype programs, interestingly enough, with the assistance of the AOPA, to improve pilot judgment during training. @!CRIER : OK, we 've got to take a quick break. Got more ahead. Do n't go away. &lt;22:39&gt; @(COMMERCIAL-BREAK) @!CRIER : Welcome back. Continuing my conversation on the Kennedy- Bessette tragedy. My guests are Drew Steketee -- got it! @!STEKETEE : Wonderful. Butch, I want to talk to you before we run out of time. Some very dramatic conversation during the breaks. You said first off that you believe it would cost less to put a transponder on every general aviation aircraft that you described that would signal underwater than it cost to retrieve these three victims. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so forth, yeah. And with the millions of dollars that 's been spent here, certainly. @!CRIER : Yeah. And I do n't want to comment on millions spent on -- on... @!CRIER :... these families because, you know, this is a horrific tragedy, and that 's not to... @!CRIER : I know you are n't, but -- but you got a phone call this morning. Tell me about the phone call. upstate New York, a very frantic message. And in fact, I called her back because we thought it was an 8-to-10-month-old child that had been drowned. And we discovered that her son drowned 8 to 10 months ago, actually in December, in upstate New York. He 's in 280 feet of water. They ca n't find him. They ca n't dive that deep. She has been begging for relief. She was just about getting over it, and apparently this incident -- and she loves the Kennedy family. That was explained to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get my son? " And she was begging for us to come through our non-profit organization and try and come get him, find him if we can. @!CRIER : And you 're going to work on that, are n't you?
