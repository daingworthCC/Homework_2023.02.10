247641 SCOTT SIMON, Host : I 'm Scott Simon. This week, Margaret Chase Smith turned 96. Strong, serene and noble as a Maine evergreen, the former representative and senator was one of the first legislators to denounce the defamations of Joseph McCarthy. She told NPR last summer that she sensed a capacity for difference and determination that helped her keep hold of her personal convictions in public life. MARGARET CHASE SMITH : If I had something I wanted to do, I just went ahead and did it. I like to have somebody to think I 'm different @!SIMON Coming up after the newscast, the Week in Review with Daniel Schorr. Today is Saturday, December 18, 1993. news headlines SIMON : This is Weekend Edition. I 'm Scott Simon. Admiral BOBBY RAY INMAN : I had to reach a level of comfort that we could work together, that I would be very comfortable in your role as the Commander-in-Chief, Mr. President, while I was Secretary of Defense, and I have found that level of comfort @!SIMON Retired Navy Admiral Bobby Ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's next Secretary of Defense. Joining us now is Weekend Edition 's Daniel Schorr. Good morning, Dan. DANIEL SCHORR, Correspondent : Morning Scott @!SIMON And uh, and here you had this scene and the White House. Mr. Inman noting that he 'd voted for George Bush, that he had n't sought to be appointed Secretary of Defense and then, I almost impertinently, it seemed, saying that he had to have confidence before he 'd dare accept the job @!SCHORR Well, I 'll tell you Scott. I know Bobby Inman a little bit and I think he 's the only person I know who can put the President of the United States on probation. And this is not the first time that he 's starts ahead of the game by playing hard to get or being hard to get. In 1981, he expressed great reluctance to become deputy to CIA Director Bill Casey, with the result that he got himself promoted to Full Admiral, the first Full Admiral of his age in peacetime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any ship, not a PT Boat. So, behind that self-deprecating smile, there lies an awesome self-confidence. One other little note about Bobby Inman and let me say Bobby is his official name. I 'm not being familiar with him. When he used to go up to Capitol Hill with Bill Casey to brief the intelligence committees and this at at time when Casey was running covert operations that Inman did n't approve of. The senators would note that Inman would sometimes fidget and compulsively pull up his socks in the middle of Casey 's testimony and they came to a conclusion that he was signalling to them or to himself when Casey was telling some particularly outrageous lie. He really endeared himself @!SIMON Well, watch the socks. As they say in the White House already I 'm sure. laughter What changes would you anticipate might occur at the Pentagon or in defense policy? SCHORR : Well, Admiral Inman is less conceptual and a much better organizer than Les Aspin, so I imagine that the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and regaining the confidence of the military brass. I think that Inman fancies himself as a CEO of some very big corporation. On foreign policy, I think he 's less inclined than Aspin to move into that area and I imagine he 'll be more inclined to defer to Secretary Christopher and National Security Adviser Tony Lake @!SIMON Let me ask you about something which was revealed this week and I suppose it 's not only the nations of the old Soviet Union that are revealing bits of Cold War history, but in the post-war era, there were U.S. medical scientists in the nuclear industry who were conducting radiation tests on American citizens @!SCHORR You bet and that 's not all. You know, thanks to the Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary, who has this policy called coming clear, they are coming clean and we 're learning some quite hair raising things about what the nuclear weapons program did to the health of Americans. It did n't do much to the Russians. And there they were, protected as they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no one seemed to worry very much about and aside from the things that were just negligence, there were these deliberate acts of exposing soldiers to radiation, injecting unwitting hospital patients with plutonium and this, what should I say, zeal for experimentation that reminds we a little bit of Doctor Mengele @!SIMON Uh-huh @!SCHORR But, no I guess that 's not fair. But we now learn about these things. If they happen in the Soviet Union, they say it 's a totalitarian regime and what do you expect, they do n't set a high value on human life, they 're not Americans. And Americans did it too. It 's what happens when you 're involved in a great anti-Communist crusade. You 've got ta run the race against the evil empire and there is something very corrupting about secrecy @!SIMON In the major nation of course, of what used to be the old Soviet Empire, this week in Russia there were elections. And although things do n't look as discouraging perhaps as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise of right-wing national settlement that resulted in a considerable victory for that party @!SCHORR That 's right and on Monday there was something close to panic because of the way that Zhirinovsky simply burst upon the scene, suddenly there with all of his wild talk and looking as though he was going to head the strongest party in the parliament, the Duma. And it was so interesting that President Clinton reacted by saying, aw, yeah, it was just a protest vote, sounded just the way he sounded by the way, after our election in November, just a protest way, not to be taken seriously. But it is to be taken seriously. Not immediately because we 're going to see Zhirinovsky in power, which will not happen soon, if ever. But because of the impact of that in the first place on Yeltsin. The first - Yeltsin 's been strangely quiet all week. The first thing that happened is that his cabinet met and they decided in effect to slow down economic reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is inflationary and tends to be anti-reform. So the first thing to worry about is what it 's going to do to Yeltsin trying to fend off this threat @!SIMON What effect do you think it 's going to have on U.S. policy, towards Russia and maybe perhaps other encircling states in the region? SCHORR : Well, the administration policy is to stay the course with Yeltsin if it is allowed to. But, you know, there are going to be questions raised in Congress about how wise it is to keep so many eggs in a Yeltsin basket if there is a danger that one of these days it could become the Zhirinovsky basket. The East European governments were supposed to be asking not to ask for full membership in NATO. We 'll give them some associate membership. There now, we 're very nervous again and saying they need to have better protection than we so far offer them. There are the Zhirinovsky ties to the Nazi, neo-Nazis in Germany. That 's kind of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course with Yeltsin, not wanting to weaken him. But the spector of Russia in the hands of someone who would like Russia to have sway over everything from Central Asia to Alaska, has a chilling affect and must have a chilling affect @!SIMON By contrast, of course, in a much smaller country, the Los Angeles Times reported yesterday that this nation, this administration, is no longer specifically and staunchly committed to reinstating President Aristede in Haiti @!SCHORR Well, officially the United States stands resolutely behind Aristede, but I imagine it 's getting further and further behind Aristede, I would say @!SIMON laughter Just far enough behind to push? SCHORR : Yeah, right. As a statement of policy, dumping, saying they were dumping Aristede, that may be wrong. As a statement of policy. But as a reflection of thinking in the administration, it 's exactly on the mark. What simply is happening is that Aristede has not been very flexible. They do n't see a way to get him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tire of this whole effort. And so as this year ends, goodbye democracy in Haiti. Maybe goodbye stability in Somalia, pretty soon, goodbye Bosnia @!SIMON Well, let 's take a look at Northern Ireland though because at least this week - SCHORR : On the bright side @!SIMON The bright side we turn to Northern Ireland. This is unusual - the prospect perhaps of some kind of brokered agreement there @!SCHORR A slender hope for peace. Slender, but the first hope for peace in a very long time. Joint statement by Britain, the Republic of Ireland which is aimed at getting the IRA to lay down arms and negotiate, opening the way to a referendum in Northern Ireland to let the people there decide their own fate. It is hopeful but the IRA has n't signed on yet. Lot 's of people are holding their breath. It 's fragile, but the first sign of peace in the oldest civil conflict we have @!SIMON Let me ask you if I could quickly about Senator Packwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess, the recordings of his diaries before they were subpoenaed. Um, is this turning a battle over ethics into a struggle over some legal definitions? SCHORR : Well, if this were in a courtroom, it would boil down to a legalism of whether you can tamper with evidence if you know it 's gon na be subpoenaed but before the subpoena 's actually been served. But this is not a courtroom. This is a legislative process and therefore, it is a political process. You can be judged to be unethical and unfit to serve as a senator while not being convicted of any crime. When Senator Nancy Kassebaum, very moderate, on the whole has been a good friend of Packwood 's, asks him to resign, saying she 's not convinced that he 's done anything criminal. What she 's just simply saying is that Senator Packwood today looks so disgraced that he can not effectively serve the people of the state and that he would do the party, the senate and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, thank you very much.
