247241 Scott Simon, host : This week the National Symphony Orchestra presented the world premiere of " Gentle Emanation, " the third part of a symphonic tetralogy by the Russian composer Vyacheslav Artyomov. The concert hall of the Kennedy Center in Washington DC, was plusher, quieter surroundings from the environs in which Mr. Artyomov wrote his music last year. It was in a mountain house in Armenia, the Communist Party-sponsored composers ' retreat, while war in Armenia raged around him. Vyacheslav Artyomov( Russian Composer) : From -- on one side were so people with guns. It was so suffering people because of not so much who there, but from other side were so wide mountains and blue sky and birds and trees and -- that 's mixture, you know. We have from one side this world, but from other side, created by God, real nature. It 's the nature we -- we need more for our creativity. Simon : It 's the influence of the suffering that in many ways you hear in the music. There are three movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the string section is quivering and -- and vibrating and just kind of hovering over the rest of the piece, like something is about to happen. Artyomov : I would n't say that I describe something -- any picture -- in music, except one. This symphony represents a process of changing in your soul. You can also compare with the soul of your country, if you want.( Excerpt from " Gentle Emanation ") Simon : In 1979 you were denounced by these committees they used to have in the Communist Party, and your music was labeled ' pretentious. ' Is it? Artyomov : Maybe. I do n't know the correct meaning of this word. Simon : Pretentious? Puffed up. Artyomov : You know, they call it " avant-garde, " " so-called avant-garde " music, and they did n't accept. Simon : Avant-garde. Artyomov : Avant-garde, yes. Simon : They -- they -- they wanted something that was more literal, that promoted the Russian Revolution. Artyomov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uh-huh. Artyomov : But for bureaucracy, it -- it meant that you are out of their circle. Simon : Mr. Artyomov was never considered a political composer, but he was denounced along with other Soviet composers for participating in a music festival in Cologne which had been forbidden by the Soviet government. But a few years later, for reasons just as obscure, Vyacheslav Artyomov was brought out of disfavor shortly after he and his wife, the poet Valeria Libetskaya, began a musical collaboration. As Mr. Artyomov describes it, their own form of perestroika began. Artyomov : In 1981 we had our first concert together with a great hall with a big audience, and that was be -- the beginning. In that year my first LP appeared, my own music, and I recorded eight LPs in five cities in the Soviet Union.( Excerpt from Artyomov 's music) Simon : Let me introduce somebody who 's been sitting here as we 've been chatting in the studio : Yuri Agapov, who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. That 's a commercial bank which actually commissioned your composition. Mr. Agapov, thank you very much for being with us. Yuri Agapov( Chairman of the Board, Creto Bank of Moscow) : Thank you. Simon : Now, this is something -- this is a sign from the new Russia, is n't it? Agapov : The situation is a little bit strange for our commercial banks and for our commercial companies, private companies also, because now all companies want to receive a lot of profit, a lot of money, and to become very rich. Simon : How did this actually work out, you commissioning this piece of music? Agapov : I think that mechanism of this relationship is -- is not important. The most important thing is that -- I can not say that I am a very serious lover of classical musics. I was never a fan of such music as Mr. Artyomov is writing now. But my idea is that if people want to create something new... Simon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's your music. But I think we 'll never found seriously based market economy in the Soviet Union, in Russia, if we will not establish new Russian culture. Simon : I ask about your commercial relationship because this -- this occurs to me, Mr. Artyomov. There have been artists in the West for years who have said, ' Look, of course the way of an artist can be very difficult in what we used to call the Soviet bloc, because they can be locked up and they can be expelled and exiled like Solzhenitsyn, or worst off, they can be censored and just not read or listened to. But this -- on the other hand, the government does provide for artists. It gives them homes, it gives them not too taxing jobs. It -- it promotes and supports their interests. ' Artyomov : Yeah. Simon : You turn to a capitalist economy, and the government does n't do that, at least not very often. Artyomov : Yeah. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Artyomov : So because of that, it 's very important that continues tradition of prerevolution Russia, which for me now connected with Mr. Agapov commissions, that 's the beginning of long-lasting tradition of old Russia. Simon : Which -- and that tradition was... Artyomov : Tradition connected with the investment in culture. Without investment, the culture will not exist now. Simon : Even if he does n't particularly like the music? Artyomov : Of course. Simon : It 's his right nowadays, I guess, is n't it? Artyomov : Because government ca n't support now. They have no money now. Simon : M -- Mr. Agapov, has anyone said to you, ' With all of the troubles we have in Moscow now, why are you spending money on... ' Agapov : What kind of troubles? What kind of troubles do you mean? Simon : Well, the -- the economic troubles that we see... Agapov : Mm-hmm. Simon :... lack of food and -- forgive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm describing many parts of our own country as well -- but lack of hope, people without enough money, people without jobs. Has anyone ever said to you as, in fact, I think they have said to Americans, ' With all the problems we have, why are you spending money on this, a piece of art? ' Agapov : Very good question. Frankly speaking, nobody never said any such things, never. I do n't know why, but never. I had a lot of opportunities to present my activities in this sphere. Everything depends on our shareholders and on our clients. If they will be against these activities, everything will finished. But I think that now we are strong enough to explain them that this kind of activities is one of the most important for our bank. It 's non-profitable one, but it 's normal human life. Artyomov : It 's very important to have such people as Mr. Agapov and his bank and such an organization to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no nation. Simon : ' Without music, there is no nation '? Artyomov : No nation. There is no bird without singing. That 's the saying. But musicians are leaving the country ; probably in the nearest time much more will -- will leave the country, so we need to support the cultural life and especially music. Simon : Mr. Artyomov and Mr. Agapov, thank you very much, both of you, for your time. Artyomov : Thank you. Agapov : Thank you very much. Simon : Russian composer Vyacheslav Artyomov, whose composition " Gentle Emanation " was given its world premiere this week by the National Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Mstislav Rostropovich. We also spoke with Yuri Agapov, who is the chairman of the board of Creto Bank of Moscow. We 'll close out this segment with Mr. Artyomov 's " In Memoriam. "( Excerpt from " In Memoriam ") Simon : This is NPR 's " Weekend Edition. "( Credits given) Simon : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ")
