249241 Announcer : We 're THE SATURDAY EARLY SHOW coming to you from the General Motors Building on Fifth Avenue in New York City. @!MAGGIE-RODRIGUEZ- : As we have been promising all morning, our @!CHEF-ON-A-SHOESTRIis here making a classic Thanksgiving dinner for eight people on a special budget of $80. Rick Rodgers is the author of more than 30 cookbooks including " Thanksgiving 101. " Here 's here this morning with foolproof tips for a great holiday feast. Hi, Rick. @!Mr-RICK-RODGERS-@1 : Hi. How are you, Maggie? @!RODRIGUEZ : I 'm great. I 'm so looking forward to this. Tell me what 's on the menu. @!Mr-RODGERS : Well, let 's take a look here. We have this delicious butternut squash soup with some prosciutto on top. And then we 'll move on to some side dishes. Nice make-ahead side dishes of a mashed potato casserole, some sweet potatoes with a praline topping and, of course, the star of the show, a roast turkey and gravy. And then we have a delicious stuffing with some dried apples and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And homemade cranberry sauce. But we could n't forget the regular cranberry sauce, too. @!RODRIGUEZ : Right. @!Mr-RODGERS : Broccoli with roasted garlic butter and a pumpkin roll. @!RODRIGUEZ : Whoo! That 's intimidating. That 's a lot to get to. How do we keep it from being intimidating? What do we think about? @!Mr-RODGERS : As many things as you can make ahead. @!RODRIGUEZ : OK. @!Mr-RODGERS : You can make your cranberry sauce now, you can make your pie crusts now and roll it out and put it in the freezer. So choose recipes that are going to work for you and that are going to fit in your oven. Do n't get too many things that you have to shove in the oven at the last minute or you 're going to have a traffic jam. @!RODRIGUEZ : All right. So that 's why the first thing that you make is really perfect. You choose to serve soup as the first course. How come? @!Mr-RODGERS : Some kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen. You 're the cook. You need as much time as you can get. So take the turkey out of the oven, let it sit for half an hour before you carve it. @!RODRIGUEZ : OK. @!Mr-RODGERS : That way the juices in the bird are going to relax. You have a nice, juicy bird. Serve some soup or some salad and your side dishes are in the oven. You 've just bought yourself a half an hour. @!RODRIGUEZ : And this is squash soup. @!Mr-RODGERS : Mm-hmm. @!RODRIGUEZ : I know you purposely do n't put cream in it. Why? @!Mr-RODGERS : Because if you have too much cream in it, it 's going to fill you up. Make a nice, light first course. @!RODRIGUEZ : All right. Now we have to taste it. @!Mr-RODGERS : OK. @!RODRIGUEZ : A little prosciutto on top. @!Mr-RODGERS : You know, you can leave the prosciutto out. There 's some sage in there, too. @!RODRIGUEZ : Nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the... @!Mr-RODGERS : The consistency, yeah. @!RODRIGUEZ : All right. @!Mr-RODGERS : The star. @!RODRIGUEZ : The star of the show. @!Mr-RODGERS : Star of the show. @!RODRIGUEZ : What kind of turkey do we get? @!Mr-RODGERS : Well, I 'm a fresh turkey fan. You know, if you 're going to buy a frozen bird, you want to buy it this weekend, let it defrost in the refrigerator. It takes a full 25 -- 24 hours for every five pounds of bird. @!RODRIGUEZ : OK. @!Mr-RODGERS : So you want to defrost it in the refrigerator. For my money, I 'd rather get a fresh bird on Tuesday or Wednesday, takes up less room in the refrigerator. @(Graphic-on-screen) Early Facts This year, Americans will eat 48 million turkeys -- 345,000 tons of meat @!RODRIGUEZ : OK. And what have you put on it? Is that butter? @!Mr-RODGERS : Just butter and some salt and some pepper. Paprika 's only going to burn. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Why the butter? What does that do? @!Mr-RODGERS : It 's going to melt into your pan and give you extra fat for your drippings. @!RODRIGUEZ : Mm. @!Mr-RODGERS : For your gravy. @!RODRIGUEZ : Yum, yum, yum, yum. @!Mr-RODGERS : Now, number one tip I want to share with you. @!RODRIGUEZ : Yes. @!Mr-RODGERS : This is just string so if I want to tie the wings down later and also string over here if I want to tie the drumsticks down. @!RODRIGUEZ : OK. @!Mr-RODGERS : OK. Now, the biggest problem with the turkey is that you 've got a lot going on here. Normally when we bake something we 're only doing one piece of the animal. Got a whole turkey here. The dark meat cooks differently than the white meat. @!RODRIGUEZ : Mm-hmm. @!Mr-RODGERS : To keep the white meat nice and moist, put some foil right over the breast and then take your... @!RODRIGUEZ : Because it takes longer to cook. @!Mr-RODGERS : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area. @!RODRIGUEZ : Oh. @!Mr-RODGERS : The heat 's going to bounce off of there. OK? Then during your last hour of your estimated roasting time, you 're just going to take this off and you are done. @(Graphic-on-screen) Early Facts Americans will eat 5 million gallons of jelled cranberry sauce @!RODRIGUEZ : That 's amazing. So foil just over the breast. Take it out half an hour before cooking. @!Mr-RODGERS : Maybe an hour. @!RODRIGUEZ : OK. And what do you stuff the turkey? Do you stuff the turkey? @!Mr-RODGERS : I love bread stuffing except when you put bread stuffing in there, you are going to be adding weight to the turkey. So if you 're in a hurry, then you can just put some nice vegetables and some herbs in there. So I have handfuls of fresh herbs. Do n't those smell great? @!RODRIGUEZ : Smell amazing. Oh, my gosh! @!Mr-RODGERS : Because this will season the juices for the bird. And then here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Perfect. Beautiful. How long do we cook it? @!Mr-RODGERS : About 15 minutes for a stuffed bird per pound, 12 minutes for an unstuffed bird, 325 degrees. @!RODRIGUEZ : And the pan matters? @!Mr-RODGERS : Absolutely. You want a nice, good, heavy pan because it 's going to soak up the heat in the oven and help brown your drippings for your gravy. Do n't forget a rack because otherwise the bird will sit in the juices. @!RODRIGUEZ : Oh. @!Mr-RODGERS : Try not to use a disposable foil pan. @!RODRIGUEZ : OK. @!Mr-RODGERS : Invest in a good roasting pan. You 'll love it. @!RODRIGUEZ : All right. What do you do with this? The innards? @!Mr-RODGERS : Good homemade turkey stock is the secret of a good Thanksgiving, too. Because now when I make my gravy, it 's going to taste like turkey, not like canned broth. @!RODRIGUEZ : Exactly. @!Mr-RODGERS : Be sure that you saute the neck and the gizzard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? The heart. @!RODRIGUEZ : Sauteed gizzard is not my favorite. @!Mr-RODGERS : The floppy purple thing is the liver. It 's not good in your stock, but it is good in your stuffing and things like that. @!RODRIGUEZ : OK. You make a stock and use it in the gravy? @!Mr-RODGERS : Yeah. @!RODRIGUEZ : Beautiful. Let 's get to our sweet potatoes. @!Mr-RODGERS : Sweet potatoes. @!RODRIGUEZ : Are these boiled? @!Mr-RODGERS : They are lightly boiled for about -- oh, about five minutes just until they 're half-way done. @!RODRIGUEZ : OK. @!Mr-RODGERS : If I were home, I would be washing my hands in soap and water. But I 'm not. @!RODRIGUEZ : Yeah, yeah. @!Mr-RODGERS : But I 'm not, so I need to make some streusel here. This is just flour and butter and brown sugar. @!RODRIGUEZ : Hm. @!Mr-RODGERS : You mix this together and then we 're going to put some pecans in here. @!RODRIGUEZ : I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What about them makes them not so cloyingly sweet? @!Mr-RODGERS : Well, the fact that I 'm not putting marshmallows on top. @!RODRIGUEZ : OK. @!Mr-RODGERS : OK? @!RODRIGUEZ : And we 're still not going to be cheated of that yummy marshmallowy taste because you 're using this. @!Mr-RODGERS : This is absolutely one of my most popular dishes. @!RODRIGUEZ : OK. @!Mr-RODGERS : I teach Thanksgiving classes all year-round. @!RODRIGUEZ : What is this, cream? @!Mr-RODGERS : This is cream. @!RODRIGUEZ : There you go. @!Mr-RODGERS : I have taken all of the calories out of this dish, especially for us. You bake this for about a half an hour. @!RODRIGUEZ : We 'll go with that. @!Mr-RODGERS : Then when it gets going, then you put your streusel on top. @(Graphic-on-screen) Early Facts Grocery stores sell 70 million pies each Thanksgiving @!RODRIGUEZ : Flour, brown sugar, pecans. Beautiful. All right. Let 's talk about cranberries. @!Mr-RODGERS : Cranberry chutney, another one of my most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve the canned stuffed, go fo... @!RODRIGUEZ : You have to. @!Mr-RODGERS : You know, Thanksgiving is about nostalgia. @!RODRIGUEZ : You have to, absolutely. @!Mr-RODGERS : But this one has crystalized ginger, some jalapeno, some lemon, garlic and some spices in there. @!RODRIGUEZ : Wow! @!Mr-RODGERS : A little bit of mustard. It is fantastic. @!RODRIGUEZ : Huh. And that 's what it looks like at the end? Let 's go through this beautiful spread that you have here. @!Mr-RODGERS : OK. @!RODRIGUEZ : Some of the other things. The mashed potatoes. @!Mr-RODGERS : Mashed potatoes. Make ahead. They have sour cream and cream cheese in it. @!RODRIGUEZ : OK. That 's how my mom makes them. @!Mr-RODGERS : And just go ahead and use -- let 's go to the stuffing. Just go ahead and use stuffing mix for your stuffing. @!RODRIGUEZ : OK. @!Mr-RODGERS : Make it easy on yourself. @!RODRIGUEZ : Beautiful. @!Mr-RODGERS : Make sure that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw vegetables or raw meat in there. You just want to touch base with... @!RODRIGUEZ : Hey, guys. @!Mr-RODGERS :... got to have to have fresh, green vegetables. @!CHRIS-WRAGGE-co-h : We 've been dining over here. Nice to see you. This is fantastic. @!RODRIGUEZ : Fresh veggies. And what 's for dessert? That 's interesting looking? @!Mr-RODGERS : You can always buy a pumpkin pie. Do n't stress out about baking a pumpkin pie if you 're not a good baker. This is a delicious, easy cake that 's rolled up with some cream cheese and, you know, my mom makes chocolate cream pies for Thanksgiving. @!RODRIGUEZ : There are no rules. @!Mr-RODGERS : There are no rules. @!RODRIGUEZ : We make rice and beans. We 're Cuban. Whatever you want. @!Mr-RODGERS : Exactly. So again, do n't stress out. Pick recipes that are good for you. @!RODRIGUEZ : All right. Let 's see how did you on our budget. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see, for the first course, Rick bought butternut squash, an onion, a carrot, celery, garlic, chicken stock and prosciutto.
