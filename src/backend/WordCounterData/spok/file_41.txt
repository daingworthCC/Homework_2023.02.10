225541 HARRY @!SMITH, co-host : Tomorrow night on CBS " 48 Hours " takes its cameras into the sometimes uplifting, sometimes heartbreaking world of organ transplants, where death for one person means life for another. And this morning, anchorman Dan Rather joins us with a preview of " 48 Hours : To Save a Life. " Good morning, Dan. @!DAN-RATHER-reporti : Good morning, Harry. You know, a lot of us can remember when heart and liver transplants were front-page news, but advances in medicine have made all kinds of transplants almost commonplace. People can live for years with someone else 's heart, liver or somebody else 's kidney. But a lot of lives that could be saved wo n't be. There simply are not enough donors. Every year, about 40,000 patients wait for heart transplants, but just a fraction -- only 2,000 -- actually get the hearts they need. And as " 48 Hours " correspondent Erin Moriarty will show us, that forces patients into a desperate race against time. qwq @( Excerpt-from- " 48-H Unidentified Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heart transplant is the waiting. Unidentified Man 2 : Over 50 days that I 'm waiting for a heart. Unidentified Woman 1 : I came here on December 30th, and you sit and wait, you know. Unidentified Man 3 : I 'm really worried because I 'm beginning to think that there are -- some of these people are just not going to get hearts. @!ERIN-MORIARTY-repo : When you 're living on the Hudson north wing of New York 's Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, you learn what the word ' patient ' really means. @!Mr-RICHIE-BURRELLE : Eight -- I 'll be in nine weeks this Thursday, not that I 'm counting. Unidentified Man 4 : Nine? @!MORIARTY : Richie Burrelle, a 42-year-old securities trader from New York, needs a heart. @!Mr-BURRELLE : Each day that you wake up, you 're one day closer to it. @!MORIARTY : But not just any heart. @!Mr-BURRELLE : I need an A-positive heart from a relatively large person. @!MORIARTY : Until there 's a donor that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!Mr-BURRELLE : It runs on electricity. You plug it in all night. When you go anywhere... @!MORIARTY :... Richie can go nowhere without his time machine, a machine that buys him time by keeping his own heart beating. @!Mr-BURRELLE : You know, it 's a 75-pound grocery cart you have to take with you wherever you go. And I 'm scared. I do n't want to leave my kids. I do n't want them to be left without a father. Unidentified Child 1 : It 's not like a storybook life, like on TV, where dad comes home at 4:00 and he sits down and smokes his pipe and reads the newspaper. It 's -- it 's real life. @!Mrs-KATHY-BURRELLE : It 's very lonely. You feel like you 're a single parent. @(unintelligible) that you do n't wipe out. @!MORIARTY : His wife, Kathy. @!Mrs-BURRELLE : I miss him very much. He 's my best friend. Unidentified Child 2 : I miss him, I 'm scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no comfort knowing, to live, someone else has to die. Do you ever -- and this is terrible to say, but do you ever think about maybe today there 'll be a traffic accident? @!Mr-BURRELLE : Yeah, you do. You do n't wish for it. I mean, you know that people die every day in various accidents and, you know, they die in hospitals and other organ failure. You just hope that if someone dies that the family will make a decision that -- that 's favorable toward organ recipients. @!Mrs-BURRELLE : We 're in this deal together. We have three children. Do n't stick me alone. You know, damn it, get better. Get home and help me. @(End-of-excerpt) @!RATHER : Erin Moriarty will have the conclusion of Richie Burrelle 's story in tomorrow night 's " 48 Hours. " Harry. @!SMITH : Any kinds of alternatives out there? @!RATHER : Well, technology is one. There -- there is -- and you will see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrific report about a -- a device that can be attached to the left ventricle of the heart. Now doctors see this at the moment as a transition to a -- a heart transplant, but they 're very encouraged and optimistic about possibly developing this into something permanent to keep the heart pumping. @!SMITH : You are once again the sole anchor of the " CBS Evening News. " And I want to -- we have 90 seconds or so here, and I want to ask you a couple of things. Do you think the co-anchor idea for that broadcast was a good idea in the first place? @!RATHER : I do, Harry. I enthusiastically embraced it, including Connie as being the -- the dual anchor. I thought then -- and -- and still believe -- that it -- it can work. Now we tried it for two years and, for a lot of reasons, it -- it did n't work for us. But I -- I -- I know that there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of itself that dual anchoring is necessarily a bad idea for the viewer. For example, you and Paula do a terrific job on this program of dual anchoring. @!SMITH : There have been charges -- not directly -- but charges of sexism involved, saying that Connie was a victim of sexism. How would you respond to that? @!RATHER : Well, first of all, I -- I refuse to believe that Connie herself has said that. I 'm pretty sure that she has n't said it -- people operating for her may have -- because Connie said when she came to the dual anchorship, she said, ' I did n't get this job because I 'm a woman. I got it because I 'm a professional journalist, ' and she was right going in. Same thing applies going out. I do n't think that kite will fly. @!SMITH : Fifteen seconds left. Hard to believe that the evening news has not been damaged in some way through all of this. Why should I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- as it has been, it 's the best of the evening news broadcasts. Yes. Do we have problems? Of course. But are we the best on the air? That 's true. And for anybody who does n't believe it, tune in tonight and we 'll show you again. @!SMITH : Thanks, Dan. @!RATHER : Thank you, Harry. @!SMITH : " 48 Hours : To Save a Life " airs tomorrow night at 10 Eastern and Pacific, 9 Central here on CBS.
