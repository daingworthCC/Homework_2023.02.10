234641 KATIE @!COURIC, co-host : For the past few weeks, we 've told you the heartwrenching story of two baby girls switched at birth at a Virginia hospital. Well, over the weekend, the two girls, Callie Conley on the left and Rebecca Chittum on the right, met each other for the first time, along with the rest of their new extended families. Paula Johnson has raised Callie Conley as her own for the last three years and is believed to be the biological mother of Rebecca Chittum. Cynthia Johnson is her attorney, and Carlton Conley is the presumed biological father of Rebecca. Good morning to you all. Thanks so much for coming to New York to visit with us. @!Ms-PAULA-JOHNSON-@ : Good morning. @!Ms-CYNTHIA-JOHNSON : Good morning, Katie, good morning. @!Mr-CARLTON-CONLEY- : Good morning. @!COURIC : We appreciate it. @!Ms-C-JOHNSON : Thank you. @!COURIC : You know, in addition to the little girls meeting each other for the first time, Paula, over the weekend, this was your first opportunity to actually see Rebecca, the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!Ms-P-JOHNSON : Yes. @!COURIC : That must have been an extraordinary experience for you. I ca n't even describe it in my question. What was it like? @!Ms-P-JOHNSON : I ca n't describe it. I tried not to cry. It was really hard. I cried a lot when she left. She 's a beautiful child. She 's absolutely beautiful. @!COURIC : Were you able to spend some good quality time with her and get to know her, or was it kind of difficult for you to not be too much in her face? @!Ms-P-JOHNSON : Yeah, that was the biggest problem. I did n't want to push her. I did n't want, you know, to scare her in any way. @!COURIC : I said you are believed to be her biological mother because you 're still waiting for DNA testing. But as far as you know, it 's basically going to confirm what you all believe to be true, correct? @!Ms-P-JOHNSON : We hope so, yes. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become available, as far as you know, or the results become apparent? @!Ms-C-JOHNSON : Well, there are two different kinds of tests being run. The first test is to determine if Paula is the biological mother of Rebecca. And then the second test will determine if Kevin and Whitney are the parents, the biological parents, of Callie. Those tests are probably expected sometime late this week. @!COURIC : But you believe they will confirm... @!Ms-C-JOHNSON : Well, the families have shared pictures. They 've shared stories of their characteristics. And I think these families in their hearts are pretty convinced that the tests will come out the way we expect. @!COURIC : In fact, the families, Paula, I understand, told you some things about little Rebecca that reminded you an awful lot of yourself? @!Ms-P-JOHNSON : Yes. @!COURIC : Either as a child or an adult. How did they describe or what kinds of things did they tell you about her that seemed to ring true? @!Ms-P-JOHNSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I also like crab legs. She wakes up in the morning and wants ice, and when I was pregnant, that 's all I craved was ice. I did n't want anything else but ice, all the time. I know that sounds strange, and I 'm still that way. I love ice. @!COURIC : What other person -- what other personality traits did they talk about that resembled yours or Carlton 's? @!Ms-P-JOHNSON : She 's very -- I do n't want to say stubborn -- she 's just very set in her ways. At three years old she already has her own personality and nobody is going to take that away from her. And I guess she gets a lot of that from me, I think. @!COURIC : How are the families of Whitney and Kevin doing? I mean, this is just such a tragedy. They were, as many people know, killed in a head-on collision on the Fourth of July, so they 're dealing with not only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly, probably, but the tragic loss of these two young people, this young mother and father. How are the families doing? @!Ms-P-JOHNSON : They 're very strong, and I think with all of them, you know, they 're going to be able to get through this no matter -- no matter what happens with the DNA tests. I mean, I still -- we 'll all be a close extended family. I do n't think there 's -- they 'll be OK. I think they 'll be OK. @!COURIC : Have you been impressed by them as people, Cynthia? @!Ms-C-JOHNSON : Well, our decision to give that press conference a week or so ago was very difficult. But we wanted to -- people to meet Paula, but we wanted also to send a message to those families that we were not here to disturb them or set -- upset them in any way. And I think -- I hope we accomplished that. @!COURIC : Carlton, what are your impressions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're really nice families. And I think that Rebecca 's got a nice familyhood with them. And they 're just real nice. They got along with each other by talking to them yesterday. We got along good. @!COURIC : It is remarkable how civil you all have been able to be throughout this whole ordeal, because we all have pictures of other situations, not quite similar to yours, but fairly similar, of custody battles or adoptions that have been reversed where there is just so much palpable heartache. It is heart breaking. That 's been important for you to try to have a good relationship and try to keep this going in a very civil manner, has n't it? @!Ms-P-JOHNSON : Yes, because I believe this is the only case that there are two living children. I believe this is the only case like that. And... @!COURIC : That we know of, anyway. @!Ms-P-JOHNSON : Yeah, that we know of, right, that we know of. @!Ms-C-JOHNSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope they are the only two. I would not want anybody to go through this, ever. I would n't want anybody to take Callie, and I believe that I would know how the other family would feel if I were to take Rebecca from them, and I would n't want anybody to go through that. @!COURIC : Let 's backtrack for a moment. It was June 29th, 1995, you gave birth to a little girl. At the time she weighs nine pounds, six ounces. And then the baby you brought home -- brought home with you was seven pounds, 12 ounces. When you brought the baby home, you thought to yourself, this baby looks a little different, did n't you? @!Ms-P-JOHNSON : Mm-hmm, repeatedly I asked. I asked the nurses and I asked doctors before we were discharged, and when we were readmitted to the emergency room, and nobody would ever give me an answer. @!COURIC : So, what do you think happened? How did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or do you believe there was something more sinister involved here? @!Ms-P-JOHNSON : I have to believe that it was a mistake. These are two -- two healthy children. You know, I believe if someone was going to purposely switch these children, they would do a healthy, you know, a healthy baby for a sick baby or a live baby for a dead baby. And I just -- I ca n't think for the life of me why somebody would do this. You know, why would they purposely do this? It does n't make sense to me. @!COURIC : Many -- like many hospitals, the University of Virginia Medical Center uses ID bracelets for mothers and babies so that they can identify the mothers and their children and keep them -- ostensibly, keep them together. But there was a point in time where your baby did not have an ID, is that right? @!Ms-P-JOHNSON : When the baby was first born, they took the baby right out of the room. I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the child until the next morning about 7 -- 7:30, and I believe that she had a band on at that time. That 's not something you really look for, you know, when you just gave birth to a child. @!COURIC : There 's confusion, though, about when the children were banded, and if there was a period of time when these two babies did not have their identification bracelets on, correct? @!Ms-C-JOHNSON : Well, Paula and Carlton can really only speak to what they saw. There are disputes. There are hospital records that say at least the baby was banded within 15 to 20 minutes after birth. Now, they were not present. They do not remember that. That does n't mean it did n't happen. OK? Paula does recall having her band placed on her several hours later when she was on the maternity ward. Now, again, they 're only speaking what they can remember and this is their story as they remember it. This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story they 've also recently told the state health department in assisting them in their investigation of the procedures at the hospital. @!COURIC : The University of Virginia has apologized for the pain that this has caused the family. They 've also said, and I 'm paraphrasing, that they 'll use this to improve their security measures. How did you feel about that apology? Did this comfort you in any way, shape, or form? @!Ms-P-JOHNSON : No. Not at all. It does n't change the fact that my child was switched and I have to continue to go through this. @!COURIC : Do you plan to sue the hospital? @!Ms-C-JOHNSON : Well, Katie, it is a little early to make that final determination. I think we 're all hoping that if they follow through with their apology, the next step would be some kind of offer of settlement. That has not taken place. I 'm hoping that that would be a step that they would consider. If they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no choice but to institute litigation against them. @!COURIC : Now, it sometimes -- people are confused somewhat, Paula, about how you and Carlton plan to continue raising Callie and also work together to help be a part of Rebecca 's life. Because this came up because you were actually trying to get higher custody payments from Carlton. You also got a restraining order against him. You all are not together as a couple, but you still plan to be very involved in the lives of both of these girls, both Callie and Rebecca? @!Ms-P-JOHNSON : Carlton has never not been a part of Callie 's life. He 's always taken an active role in her life. Callie absolutely adores her dad and he absolutely adores her, and we 're just going to do whatever it takes to make sure that both of them are happy. @!COURIC : Right now, there 's no legal arrangement, I understand, between the Rogers and the Chittums, vis-a-vis, raising Rebecca. There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they never had to go to the courts. It is just something that they worked out between the two parties. Do you hope to do the same thing? And do you think that is realistic or do you think it 's being perhaps naive to think that this can all be worked out so beautifully between these three families? @!Ms-P-JOHNSON : I 'm hoping I can fit in there in that four-month schedule like everybody else is getting -- maybe not, you know, for the full month, but to visit with the families, like, you know, whichever has Rebecca at the time. That 's what I 'm hoping. I think it can be worked out fine. I mean, I do n't see a problem with it at all. @!COURIC : Well, best of luck to both -- to all of you. I know this is been a very difficult time for you, and our very best to the Rogers and the Chittums. I know this is been hard on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlton Conley, thank you all so much. @!Ms-P-JOHNSON : Thank you. @!Ms-C-JOHNSON : Thank you. @!Mr-CONLEY : Thank you. @!COURIC : And we 'll be back in a moment, right after this.
