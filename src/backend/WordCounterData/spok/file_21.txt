222941 @!THIS-IS-A-RUSH-TRA : And now, an inspiring detective story worth a second look, particularly in light of the Independence Day weekend. In 1945, a captain was court-martialed because his cruiser went down during the war. Most of his men suffered hideous deaths at sea, attacked by sharks or slowly dying of thirst. It was a terrible tragedy and nearly forgotten until a young boy set out to pursue the truth and restore the honor of the captain and his brave crew. Lynn Sherr has this remarkable story. FORMER SHIPMATE : This brings back a lot of old memories. LYNN SHERR, ABC News :( voice-over) For the first time in more than 50 years. FORMER SHIPMATE : Permission to get aboard ship, sir. FORMER SHIPMATE : Permission to come aboard, sir. LYNN SHERR :( voice-over). these former shipmates are boarding a United States Navy cruiser. FORMER SHIPMATE : She 's a pretty ship. LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) They served together during World War II, when they were barely out of their teens. GILES MCCOY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I used to. I used to take these two and three at a time. LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) Then, they were eager enlisted men, bursting with pride to be aboard the USS Indianapolis, a ship nearly identical to this one. If you 've never heard of the Indianapolis, that 's the point. It went down under enemy fire in one of the worst disasters in naval history. But the Navy, many say, kept it a secret, then blamed the captain unfairly. It was a ship of heroes on a heroic mission, but nearly 900 men were left to die. For 53 years, these former shipmates have been fighting in vain to exonerate their captain and erase the stigma of their ordeal. PAUL MCGINNIS, USS Indianapolis Survivor : When I think about it, a lot of times I break down. It 's something that we 'll never forget. It 's burned so deeply in our mind that it 's indelible. HUNTER SCOTT : That 1500 line, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) Today, thanks to 12-year-old Hunter Scott, who is the newest and least likely hero of the Indianapolis, these veterans may finally receive the honor he thinks they deserve. HUNTER SCOTT : These were actual postcards and letters sent off of the ship. LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) Hunter has conducted a relentless investigation using personal accounts, documentation and memorabilia from survivors. HUNTER SCOTT : This is one of the last pictures taken of the USS Indianapolis. LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) His tenacity and careful re- examination of the evidence, presented as a school project, has drawn national attention to a case that had been long forgotten and to the man who was court-martialed after the loss of the Indianapolis, Captain Charles McVay III. HUNTER SCOTT : This is Captain McVay 's dog tag from when he was at the Naval Academy. It has the date he was born and the date he went in the Naval Academy. LYNN SHERR :( on camera) That 's a pretty precious thing to own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ma'am. And there 's his thumbprint on the back. LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) Hunter believes that Captain McVay was tried unjustly and that the Navy covered up its own responsibility for the loss of the ship and the death of three quarters of its crew. For more than two years now, he has made it his personal mission to correct those injustices. HUNTER SCOTT : I hope to erase all mention of the court- martial and conviction from Captain McVay 's naval record and get a presidential unit citation for the Indianapolis and crew. LYNN SHERR :( on camera) Why is it important to get Captain McVay exonerated? HUNTER SCOTT : Any injustice needs to be set right, whether it was 50 years ago, yesterday or 100 years ago. It 's still a wrong that needs to be righted. LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) Lofty goals for a 12-year-old, especially one who so loves the Navy that he hopes to attend the Naval Academy one day. HUNTER SCOTT : Daddy, here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( voice-over) In many ways, Hunter is still a kid, but one whose parents, Alan and Leslie, have instilled a deep sense of responsibility.( on camera) So you led him to believe he could do this? ALAN HUNTER : Absolutely. LESLIE HUNTER : We have encouraged him every step of the way. One person can make a big difference. ROBERT SHAW, Actor( Clip from " Jaws) : Eleven hundred men went into the water. Vessel went down in 12 minutes. LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) Hunter was 11 when he first got interested in the story of these men. ROBERT SHAW( Clip from " Jaws ") : Did n't see the first shark for about half an hour. LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) He was watching the movie " Jaws, " which he 'd seen several times before, but this time, during Captain Quint 's soliloquy about surviving the sinking of the Indianapolis, Hunter focused on every word. ROBERT SHAW( Clip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know how many sharks, maybe 1,000. I do n't know how many men. We averaged six an hour. ALAN HUNTER : And that 's when he turned around and said, " Is that a true story? " You know, it was like he could n't believe that that had actually happened to somebody. LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) The search began. When Hunter could n't find enough information at the library, he placed an ad in a local Navy paper, asking any Indianapolis survivors to get in touch. MAURICE BELL, USS Indianapolis Survivor : I 'm not sure whether three hit, but I know two hit. LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) The first to respond was Maurice Bell. HUNTER SCOTT : Were you hurt by any of the torpedoes? LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) He readily agreed to answer Hunter 's questions. Bell also provided him with a list of more than 150 other remaining survivors. Hunter contacted them all, and one by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter or a telephone call that would add another detail, an additional piece of the puzzle to help him learn the truth about the Indianapolis and its crew. HUNTER SCOTT : " When you hear the screams of someone being pulled away by a shark, it is a scream like nothing you 've ever heard or will forget. " LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) Hunter was most deeply affected by the painful stories sent to him by survivors. HUNTER SCOTT : " He pulled me down about 10 to 12 feet. I knew I was going to be eaten alive. " LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) Especially their graphic descriptions of shark attacks as they waited for rescue. HUNTER SCOTT : " Screams filled the air. The screams were those of dying men. " LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) Sharing these memories with Hunter was, for many, the first time in more than 50 years that they could write or speak about what they had endured. Their trust in him made Hunter feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives were like aboard ship. He pictured where they slept, where they would gather to relax. And the more he heard their history, the more furious he was about their fate. Hunter learned that nearly 1,200 men served aboard the USS Indianapolis, the flagship of the Fifth Fleet. But it 's not clear whether any onboard understood the magnitude of their final mission. On July 16, 1945, under command of Captain Charles McVay III, a widely respected and admired leader, the ship was ordered to proceed to the island of Tinian in the South Pacific with a top-secret cargo -- components for the atomic bomb that was to be dropped on Hiroshima. It was a moment that most of the Indianapolis crew would not live to see. They delivered the highly sensitive freight, then received orders to sail to Leyte in the Philippines. Because they were traveling in enemy waters and because the Indianapolis was not equipped to detect or defend itself from submarine attack, Captain McVay asked for an escort. His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Navy know about the route that Captain McVay was about to take the Indianapolis on? HUNTER SCOTT : The Navy knew there were two submarines in the area, I-58 and I-367. They knew them by name because we had broken the Japanese code and intercepted messages. LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) Hunter 's research led him to this report, containing a document, declassified in 1991, confirming that Japanese submarines identified as I-58 and I-367 were known to be patrolling the area where the unescorted Indianapolis was directed.( on camera) Did anybody relay that information to Captain McVay? HUNTER SCOTT : No, ma'am. It was considered top secret, and they did not think he had the security clearance to know that information. LYNN SHERR : So Captain McVay was going into enemy waters where there were enemy submarines. HUNTER SCOTT : Yes, ma'am. Without an escort. LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) July 29, 1945. It was an overcast and cloudy night. With visibility poor, Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called zigzagging. Around midnight, Machitsura Hashimoto, commander of the Japanese submarine I-58, spotted the USS Indianapolis in his periscope and fired six torpedoes. Aboard the target, 19-year-old seaman first class Loel Cox( ph) arrived at the bridge to begin his watch. Moments later, the first of two Japanese torpedoes hit its mark. LOEL COX, USS Indianapolis Survivor : We had this terrible explosion, and it blew me up in the air and down on the deck. I went on my stomach and tried to get up, and looked up and there was water and debris, sparks, flames up above the bridge, and we were 81 feet above the water line. LYNN SHERR :( on camera) This whole part of the ship would have been gone? GILES MCCOY : Yes. The whole bow right up there was taken away. LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) For these Indianapolis survivors, walking the decks of the USS Salem, where we 'd brought them, provoked agonizing memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed. PAUL MCGINNIS : I remember these very well. Without it, as I said, we would be dead men. LYNN SHERR :( on camera) Were these the exact same life vests that you used? GILES MCCOY : Similar. PAUL MCGINNIS : Very similar to this. LYNN SHERR : Put it on, Paul.( voice-over) Paul McGinnis put on his life vest that night after the second torpedo hit the powder magazine, setting off a series of explosions. The 610-foot ship, weighing 10,000 tons, was listing badly as water poured in through the gaping holes. Orders were given to shut the hatches in a desperate effort to keep the ship from sinking. One of the last to make it through before the hatches were sealed with men entombed was Giles McCoy, a private with the Marine detachment aboard. GILES MCCOY : I could still hear men hollering down there for help when I got up and they closed the hatch, so I knew that those poor people were trapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die. LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) In the radio room, repeated SOS messages were urgently sent as the men abandoned ship. For 53 years, survivors believed that those attempts to signal for help had failed, until Hunter 's detective work uncovered a dramatic new lead. Voice of RUSSELL HETZ : When we got the first SOS and we tried to confirm, we could not reach the Indianapolis. HUNTER SCOTT : Yes, sir. LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) This revealing telephone call came in while we were with Hunter. It was from Russell Hetz, who was serving in the Leyte Gulf on the night of the sinking. Hetz told Hunter that he and his crew did receive the SOS sent by the Indianapolis and then, eight and a half minutes later. Voice of RUSSELL HETZ : We received the second SOS. LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) But when no confirmation came from the sinking ship, Hetz says his superiors concluded that since a ship that size could n't sink that fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The response that we got back was that it could be a prank call or it could be a trick call. HUNTER SCOTT : Oh, that 's pretty neat. Could you put that in writing and send that to me? Voice of RUSSELL HETZ : Sure. HUNTER SCOTT : Well, thank you very much. That would help me a lot, so I could add that to my documentation. LYNN SHERR :( on camera) In fact, the ship did sink right away, did n't it? HUNTER SCOTT : Yes, ma'am. In 12 minutes. LYNN SHERR : Twelve minutes? HUNTER SCOTT : Yes, ma'am. LYNN SHERR : You 've done some research on this? HUNTER SCOTT : Yes, ma'am. Lots. LYNN SHERR : Lots indeed. You say the men were scattered in a 50-mile radius. How did they get so widely separated? HUNTER SCOTT : Well, as the ship was going and it was going under water, men were jumping off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see sailors jumping off, still leaving the ship. And the screws, or the propellers, were still turning, slowly turning. GILES MCCOY : I swam away, and the ship sucked me down. LYNN SHERR : Sucked you down underneath the water? GILES MCCOY : Yeah. When I got to the surface, I could still feel the ship exploding under the water. I could feel it in my groin. And I looked back, and there was nothing but a great big mountain of foam, white foam where the ship had been. LYNN SHERR : What did you see that next day? GILES MCCOY : Well, then we saw lots of sharks. There were just sharks everywhere, and they were just in great big schools. We kicked our feet and we splashed our hands, and most times the sharks would go around and leave us and just keep circling. And then, all of a sudden, somebody would holler " shark attack, " and you 'd look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be heading for you. They would come up underneath your feet and you could see them in that clear water. LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) Day after day, the sharks assaulted. In panic, the men cried out for help and struggled to stay afloat. They never knew who would be next as the water turned blood-red. LOEL COX : Just like lightning, they 'd come up and grab a man. And this buddy that 's about three feet from me, it grabbed him, and the water and the tail just come over and covered me up. And took him down, and I did n't see him anymore. PAUL MCGINNIS : I remember some of my friends who died and one in particular, we took his jacket off and watched him sink into the depths. LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) How long would it be before they were saved and recognized? The answer would horrify the men and their new young champion. CHARLES GIBSON : It would be more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing. Why did it take so long for anyone to notice that a huge ship with more than 1,000 men onboard had vanished? Lynn Sherr will be back with the dramatic conclusion @!ANNOUNCER Survivors continue to struggle in shark-infested waters, praying they wo n't be next, dying of dehydration. Did a series of Navy blunders mean hundreds of men died for no reason? -- when 20/20 continues.( Commercial Break) ANNOUNCER : A forgotten story about a terrible naval disaster and a boy determined to find the truth and bring honor to the brave men of the USS Indianapolis. HUNTER SCOTT : I just ca n't wait to finally get Captain McVay 's name cleared @!ANNOUNCER When 20/20 continues after this from our ABC stations.( Station Break) ANNOUNCER : 20/20 continues. And now, Charles Gibson CHARLES GIBSON : The Navy has its own version of what happened 54 years ago when the USS Indianapolis was sunk by a Japanese torpedo in the shark-infested waters of the South Pacific. But an extraordinary boy named Hunter Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at fault. Now he and the survivors of that terrible disaster are trying to rewrite the history books. Here again is Lynn Sherr. LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) Many of the nearly 900 who had survived the sinking were so severely burned or injured that they died their first few hours in the water. Countless others lost their lives to the unrelenting shark attacks. Exhausted, hungry and thirsty, many of the survivors were hallucinating. Those who shed their life vests to dive for a drink of the ocean salt water would quickly perish. As the second, then the third day passed, the expected rescue planes never arrived. Mike Kuryla was 19 years old. He still remembers telling those who were left not to give up hope. MIKE KURYLA, USS Indianapolis Survivor : Everybody was asking in our group, " When are they going to pick us up, " and what else could you say? We 'd say " tomorrow, " and of course tomorrow came and there was no rescue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) Hunter Scott is convinced that the rescue ships never came because of a series of Navy blunders. He says that when the Indianapolis passed her scheduled arrival in Leyte, she was taken off the plotting board. No one had missed the Indianapolis and no one would. HUNTER SCOTT : I think the Navy just forgot about the Indianapolis. I guess you could say they just were n't paying attention. LYNN SHERR :( on camera) How could they just forget about a cruiser with more than 1,100 men onboard? HUNTER SCOTT : I 'm not sure how they could do that, but obviously, it happened. GILES MCCOY : After we got into that fourth day, we all gave up hope. We knew we were going to die, that nobody was looking for us, and so we knew that it was all over. And so, we tried to make our peace with God. PAUL MCGINNIS : I said, " I ca n't last another day. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I did n't want to die. And you just know you ca n't make it another day. LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) Finally, on the evening of the fourth day, a bomber, piloted by Lieutenant Wilber Gwinn, was looking for Japanese submarines. Purely by accident he spotted the survivors and radioed for help. The remaining men of the Indianapolis had been found. GILES MCCOY : We all wept horribly and knew that we had a chance now that help was here. And we tried to revive the unconscious ones and tell them either, " Do n't die on us now. We got help coming. " You know, " Hang in there. Do n't give up. " LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) These pictures, many of them never seen before, were taken by a crewman on the USS Register, one of the rescue ships. Only 316 men were left. Nearly 600 of their shipmates had lost their lives in the Pacific as they spent five nights and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) Do you think about it often? GILES MCCOY : Yes, I do. I think they do, too. I think of how lucky we were. LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) Two days after the rescue operations began, the first atomic bomb, partly transported by the Indianapolis was dropped on Hiroshima. But it was not until two weeks later that the fate of the ship was released by the Navy -- the very same day that Japan surrendered and the war was over. HUNTER SCOTT : So that the big heading, " War Over, " would overshadow the sinking of the USS Indianapolis. LYNN SHERR :( on camera) If you were doing a cover-up, that would be a pretty clever way to do it, do n't you think? HUNTER SCOTT : Yes, ma'am. I think the Navy planned it that way. LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) As news finally did filter out about the survivors and the sinking, the press started asking questions. How could the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later, the focus changed when a naval board of inquiry recommended that Captain Charles McVay be held accountable for negligence and inefficiency and ordered that he be court-martialed.( on camera) Hunter, why do you believe that the Navy put Captain McVay on trial? HUNTER SCOTT : Because they did not want to blame themselves. GILES MCCOY : And they did n't want to take the abuse and the criticism for losing 880 men out there in the ocean at the end of the war and on such an important ship. And so they used Captain McVay to stick him for it. LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) The trial was shocking and insulting to survivors. But they were even more horrified when the Navy brought Commander Hashimoto in to testify against the captain. That 's right. The same commander who 'd fired the torpedoes that sunk the Indianapolis was brought to Washington, D.C. by the United States Navy to testify against Captain McVay. HUNTER SCOTT : They were hoping that Hashimoto would say something against Captain McVay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made no difference. I would have sunk her anyway. " LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) In December 1945, Captain McVay was found guilty of failure to follow a zigzag course, thus hazarding the Indianapolis. His sentence, the loss of 100 promotion points, was later remitted, but his conviction was not. Twenty-three years later, November 1968, retired Rear Admiral Charles McVay III put on his uniform, loaded his service revolver, then walked out the door and ended his own life. His guilty verdict stands to this day. GILES MCCOY : Why did they go and pick on Captain McVay? I can still remember at the court-martial, Captain McVay would stand up and say, " All I want to know is, why did you take so long to find my men? " LYNN SHERR :( on camera) Why do you think it took so long? GILES MCCOY : They just screwed up. The Navy just screwed up. And they did n't want to admit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men. LYNN SHERR : We wanted to speak with the Navy about the events surrounding the Indianapolis and about the court- martial of Captain McVay, but our requests for an interview were denied. Instead, a Navy spokesman told us that in 1996, a panel reviewed the transcripts of the court-martial and upheld its decision. And that today, the Navy stands by those findings.( voice-over) Today, the Indianapolis has a memorial in the city for which it is named. Still, the survivors do not feel adequately honored. And to( inaudible), they say their captain was made a scapegoat by the United States Navy. That 's why they have embraced Hunter Scott, the boy who has adopted their cause, because he has succeeded where they have not, refocusing attention on the Indianapolis to honor his heroes before they are all gone. HUNTER SCOTT : I just ca n't wait to finally get Captain McVay 's name cleared and right a wrong that was inflicted 53 years ago. UNKNOWN MALE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ :( voice-over) This April, young Mr. Scott went to Washington, leading a group of the survivors to lobby Congress to pass a new bill. HUNTER SCOTT : Thank you very much. I hope I can count on your support. LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) HR 3710 was placed in the hopper by the 12-year-old boy most responsible for its creation. HUNTER SCOTT : I hope I can count on your support. LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) By the 12-year-old boy to whom honor is everything. HUNTER SCOTT : The bill has a pretty good chance. LYNN SHERR :( voice-over) If it passes, Hunter Scott will have rewritten history and finally brought recognition and peace to the crew and the captain of the USS Indianapolis. HUNTER SCOTT : I think people are willing to listen to a 12- year-old boy who is serious. LYNN SHERR :( on camera) Why? HUNTER SCOTT : Just the fact that you can see a kid can make a difference in the world today. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. But thanks to Hunter Scott 's continued diligence, there are new Indianapolis resolutions pending in Congress. Hunter Scott is now a high school student, still planning to attend the U.S. Naval Academy some day, and he has been invited to attend a reunion of Indianapolis survivors at the end of this month @!ANNOUNCER Next -- houses painted like Easter eggs in wild, wonderful colors. Their owners love them. Some neighbors do n't. What 's a town to do? John Stossel with this week 's " Give Me a Break, " when 20/20 continues.( Commercial Break)
