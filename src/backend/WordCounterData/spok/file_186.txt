4082141 @!JOY-BEHAR-HOST : Mel Gibson has been seen in public. At least we think he has. Thats him in disguise, you know. Maybe he s trying to avoid the paparazzi. Who knows? But I do know one thing. That ever since Braveheart he loves playing dress-up. Look. Here he is in Malibu. Here he is on Rosh Hashanah. Here he is at the VMAs. You know, not for nothing, the man knows how to wear a brisket. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Coming up on THE JOY @!BEHAR SHOW. The NFL investigates a female reporters complaints about her treatment in a New York Jets locker room. Now the great debate rages on. Can an attractive woman in a male-dominated profession get a fair shake? And the Tea Party tallied some big wins in yesterdays primaries but can they get all the way to Washington. Plus, the masked man : wait until you see the ridiculous disguise Mel Gibson was caught wearing in L.A. That and more starting right now. @!BEHAR : NFL officials began questioning New York Jets players and coaches yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sainz. Of course, they held the questioning at Hooters, but still. Heres what Sainz had to say about the controversy when she was on my show yesterday. @! INES-SAINZ-SPORTS : Everybody start to make noses and expressions about myself. But I have eight years working in this kind of things and in Mexico and in Europe and other parts. I decide its better to go focus on my job and do nt pay attention. @!BEHAR : Thats a good idea. So did Sainz invite the cat calls and suggestive comments with her provocative attire or do women deserve to be treated professionally regardless of how theyre dressed? Even in testosterone-fueled environments. With me now to debate the issue are Jillian Barberie-Reynolds, co-host of " Good Day, L.A. " and former NFL correspondent ; Bonnie Bernstein, sports caster and host of 1050 ESPN Radio ; and Max Kellerman, CNN contributor and sports analyst. Ok. Let me start with Jillian. Ok. Sainz defended this picture of what she wore to practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture. Ok. She said its not inappropriate, rather. Im sorry. Do you agree or is she being naive when she says its not inappropriate, Jillian? @!JILLIAN-BARBERIE-R : Well, I think its a little bit of both Joy. Ive been on the NFL at the NFC Conferences for many years. I did three Super Bowls working with the NFL for ten years. I wore jeans and sweaters. Its how you fill it out. Look, shes a beauty queen. Lets call it what it is and not be naive. Shes known for her beauty. Did nt she win a big beauty contest? @!BEHAR : She was Miss Spain, I think. @!BARBERIE-REYNOLDS : Ok. So shes Miss Spain. She did nt win the contest for the academics. Its a beauty contest. So she is beautiful obviously and of course, its going to draw attention. And Joy, I can tell you, you can draw as much or as little attention as you like on the sidelines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Im also a little offended that I did nt get cat-called like that. But it is a matter of -- @!BEHAR : Really? @!BARBERIE-REYNOLDS : Well, it is a matter of -- she looks a certain way and shes going to get attention for it. @!BEHAR : All right. Thank you. Now, she tweeted after the practice that she was embarrassed by what they were doing but she did nt feel threatened by it. I have to put that out there. What do you think she expected? You sort of have to know that there are going to be cat calls in a locker room if you come in with tight pants. Im not saying they were right. Im just saying its a little disingenuous to say youre shocked by that. @!BONNIE-BERNSTEIN- : Youre talking about two different things. The first question is should they have behaved the way they allegedly have behaved? Men and women are allowed in locker rooms. There should be equal access and equal professional treatment. But I sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locker room with skin-tight jeans and thats the way you want to portray yourself, I do nt know how anybody could be surprised if there are going to be looks. The attire, Joy, does nt justify the behavior. But youre naive to think -- @!MAX-KELLERMAN-CNN : Bonnie was a gymnast. Did you ever put on as tight jeans as you could and walk into a locker room? @!BERNSTEIN : I do nt know if I would be able to walk, period, if I ever put on jeans that tight. But Ive worn jeans in the locker room but theyre more conservative. I have a shirt that covers it. Its just -- to me its all about how you want to be perceived. And I just think Im a little more conservative. @!BEHAR : But Max, shouldnt she be treated respectfully regardless of what shes wearing? I mean really? Kellerman : On the one hand, she was dressed inappropriately. I think thats pretty obvious. On the other hand -- an also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some whistles? I mean you saw her -- when she was talking to you out on the street, she was getting whistles. You heard guys yelling while she was talking to you. @!BEHAR : Were they yelling at her? We do nt know. Its New York. Who knows? @!KELLERMAN : Yes. It sounded like it. Kellerman : On the one hand she was dressed inappropriately. On the other hand, if they were saying really lewd, obnoxious things, then that is also inappropriate whether or not she could anticipate that sort of thing. @!BEHAR : Right. But I mean Bonnie, is there anything wrong with using sex appeal in a job, really? I do nt know that theres anything really -- @!BERNSTEIN : IT depends on how you want to frame your career. And Joy, frankly, I think this is one of the big problems. I think women in our business, particularly on the sports side, get caught up in trying to figure out, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? " If Im an entertainer, perhaps Im more apt to dress up the sex appeal. If Im a journalist, thats what I consider myself -- @!BEHAR : You consider yourself a journalist? @!BERNSTEIN : Yes. A lot of people -- I get it, a lot of people do nt. I wrote for my high school paper and my college paper and I majored in broadcast journalism. And when Im in a locker room, I want to be getting eye contact with somebody. I want them listening to my questions. In the event they find me attractive, thats lovely and flattering. @!BEHAR : I know but why is she responsible for their stupid behavior no matter what she wears really? Its almost like when a girl walks in Central Park at night in a short skirt, maybe, and shes attacked, they blame her. They say why is she out in the middle of the night? Why is she dressing like that? Its nobodys business when shes out really or what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theyre blaming -- this blaming of a victim -- Im not quite sure what shes a victim of. She did nt claim she was sexually harassed. She tweeted what she would feel because were in this culture now where everyone tweets. Its so narcissistic. You know, " I woke up in the morning. Im having a cup of coffee and talking to my friend. I tied my shoe. " @!BEHAR : Yes. @!KELLERMAN : Shes just tweeting in the locker room what was happening. She felt embarrassed supposedly because these guys were getting her cat calls or wolf whistles or whatever its called. @!BEHAR : What shes doing is thanking the NFL at this point and thanking the Jets -- @!BERNSTEIN : But there are mixed messages though. There are mixed messages because on the one hand, she tweeted that she was embarrassed. " Im going to die of embarrassment. " On the other hand, shes spoken with other news outlets where she thought it was all in good fun. I did nt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatened. @!KELLERMAN : Have you seen the work Web site -- the Azteca TV Web site? The Web site of her employer has her in a bikini -- several shots of her in a bikini in sexual poses. @!BEHAR : So? @!KELLERMAN : This is on her Web site. @!BEHAR : So what. @!KELLERMAN : In other words, she is using her sex appeal to advance her career actively and billing herself that way. So if she simply gets some cat calls, to me thats not a big deal. @!BEHAR : Ok. Jillian -- ok, jump in there Jillian. Go ahead. @!BARBERIE-REYNOLDS : Yes. I know, I totally agree with what you guys are saying. Much like Bonnie, I have a journalism degree. Its how you want to be perceived. Im sure I could have worn the bubble butt jeans and the crop-top -- whatever. It is what it is. And I do nt think shes trying to mask herself as being something shes not. Shes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman in sports or whatever. @!BEHAR : The hottest. The hottest reporter. @!BARBERIE-REYNOLDS : Hottest, excuse me, shes hot. Yes. Just ask her. Shes sizzling. @!KELLERMAN : Jillian, you seem very into her. Ive got to say. @!BEHAR : What are you trying? Start a rumor -- @!KELLERMAN : Im just saying. Thats like the fifth comment shes made. @!BEHAR : Because she identifies, thats why. Right, Jillian? Go ahead. Shes hot also? @!KELLERMAN : Clearly. @!BARBERIE-REYNOLDS : No. I do nt know what Max means by that. But I do know that -- @!KELLERMAN : Joy, do you know what I mean? @!BARBERIE-REYNOLDS : You cant -- I do nt know that you can have it both ways. Either -- I think there are beautiful women. I worked with Pam Oliver for ten years. I do nt think Pam is -- shes one of the most respected sideline reporters in the NFL. I do nt think shes ever had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is the first time in her 100 interviews or something she said along those lines that shes ever had this problem. I think we can vilify her and say as much as we want about her. I do nt think I would have ever worn a belly shirt out there. @!BEHAR : Ok. But what about the fact that men, in general -- you would know about this -- the men who run these leagues and everything and also the networks, they want her to look like that. Shes only doing what the job description sort of requires. Isnt that true? @!BERNSTEIN : I think theres actually a little bit of a cultural divide here. I think they do. To Maxs point about the Azteca TV website. They do play up her sexuality. I think we see that more in entertainment here. I think by and large in sports, you see it sometimes. You see it in other times. @!BEHAR : yes. @!BERNSTEIN : But overall, Joy -- and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue. In my almost 20 years in the business now, Ive never had an issue in the NFL. And theyre going after this in the dressing -- @!BEHAR : So you do nt have that when you go into the locker room? They do nt come on to you that way or cat call or anything like that to you? @!BERNSTEIN : Ive never had an issue when Im in the locker room. @!BEHAR : Because youre an attractive woman -- why do nt they do that to you? @!BERNSTEIN : Maybe they do nt find me attractive. @!BEHAR : They do. Im sure they do. @!KELLERMAN : I think that Bonnies a professional and her resume says it. And she takes her job seriously and shes not simply exploiting her sexuality to get ahead. I mean, its a simple as that. @!BEHAR : These guys -- some of them are naked in the locker room, I understand. Have you encountered that? @!BERNSTEIN : Inevitably that will happen on occasion. Theyre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapping towels around but thats the other side of this. There has been a lot of debate in the last couple of days as to whether women should even be in the locker room. Its our job. @!KELLERMAN : Or reporters should have a separate room for this. They do nt need male or female reporters in the locker room. @!BEHAR : Jillian, do you get this behavior towards you? @!BARBERIE-REYNOLDS : No. And again I was on the sideline for many Super Bowls and talked to the players if theyre down there. Do they come over and say flirty things and have fun -- absolutely, as theyre warming up. But it was never an issue and I never took offense to it by any means. And to what Bonnie is saying, if you go back and look at -- I mean, are males allowed in the female -- lets say synchronized swimmers or gymnasts. Are male reporters allowed to see women naked? @!BERNSTEIN : They are allowed -- reporters at the locker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The WNBA, the men can be in there. @!BEHAR : So men do go in there? @!BERNSTEIN : And I just know having been a college gymnast, that I would feel terribly uncomfortable if I had men in the locker room. But you have to understand Joy were in there because were on deadlines, were getting interviews. We do nt have time for guys to take their showers and get dressed and put their jewelry on and call his wife -- @!BEHAR : So you cant wait until they are finished. @!BERNSTEIN : I know and there is a guy -- @!BEHAR : I see because that was an issue why not wait until -- @!KELLERMAN : I mean, I think that most athletes are uncomfortable with reporters in the locker room, period. @!REYNOLDS : And I get that. I totally get that. @!BEHAR : All right, I think Im going to walk around in a hot outfit at the( INAUDIBLE) court in Central Park from now on and see what happens. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trouble, Joy? @!BEHAR : Yes, you will. But I might enjoy it. You never know. Thanks everybody. Up next, the Tea Partiers are partying a little harder after some key primary wins. But will the movement crash and burn in the general election? Stay tuned. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Coming up a little later on THE JOY @!BEHAR SHOW, Mel Gibsons attempt to go incognito backfires big time. Well have the latest on Mels ridiculous disguise. And Bristol Palin prepares for her debut on " Dancing with the Stars " with a little help from none other than Kate Gosselin. Now back to Joy. @!BEHAR : Well, it looks like the Tea Party knocked the moderates out of the box last night. They celebrated major victories in primary races in the northeast. But none bigger than Delawares Christine ODonnell who shocked many by defeating the GOP establishments pick, Mike Castle. Watch. @! CHRISTINE-ODONNEL : Ladies and gentlemen, the people of Delaware have spoken. No more politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party candidate heading to the senate or will the Democrats beat her in the general election? With me now to discuss this is Roy Sekoff, founding editor of the " Huffington Post " ; also with me is Leslie Sanchez, Republican strategist and author. Welcome to the show you guys. You know Leslie -- @!ROY-SEKOFF-FOUNDI : Thanks Joy. @!BEHAR : -- when she was -- when she was running in the primary, the National Republican Senatorial Committee did nt give her money. And the GOP did nt support her. Now, that seems to have all changed. Is that because everyone loves a winner or because they have no choice and they just has to go with it? What do you think? @!LESLIE-SANCHEZ-RE : Youre -- Joy youre a little bit right on both. Quite honestly to think about that ; the truth is that she has proven to be a viable candidate. People in the state of Delaware support her, like her ideas. And do nt forget, she was talking about economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and freedom. It resonated. And people learned long enough -- long ago not to try to predict Delaware. So I think with respect to that, you saw the senatorial committee, Republicans come out and support her. Put a little a bit of money in her coffers. And I think youll see a lot more. Her Web site went down -- @!BEHAR : Right. @!SANCHEZ : -- a lot of people are saying because the donations are coming in. @!BEHAR : Well, they have no choice, Roy, right? But is this a little penny wise and dollar foolish -- Roy? I mean -- @!SEKOFF : Well, you know, I mean, its really is a small amount that were talking about, Joy. I mean, I think that -- did nt Michael Steeles boys spend more than that at the lesbian strip club out here in Los Angeles last year? @!BEHAR : Oh, boy. @!SEKOFF : So were not talking a lot of money. Its not -- its not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million. So its a little bit of money to buy some goodwill with a very important part of their constituency. So I think it was a no-brainer that they had to turn around and do it after saying -- @!BEHAR : Right. @!SEKOFF : -- that they werent going to do it last night. @!BEHAR : Ok now Karl Rove, believe it or not, slammed this woman, ODonnell, last night on Fox News. Watch this. @! KARL-ROVE-FOX-NEW : Ive met her. Im not, Ive got to tell you I wasnt frankly impressed as -- in her abilities as a candidate. And there are just a lot of nutty things shes been saying that just simply do nt add up -- @!BEHAR : A lot of nutty things, Leslie? Is there trouble in paradise? @!SANCHEZ : You know, I think people had a lot of pre-conceived notions about this candidate. Once they win the primary, its amazing how it creates strange bedfellows. But bottom line shes energized the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican opponent to Barack Obama and basically saying, there wasnt a lot of light between those two. Its something that should concern the Democrats more than the Republicans. @!BEHAR : Roy, it seems -- @!SEKOFF : Yes but it -- @!BEHAR : -- to me that -- @!SEKOFF : Yes. @!BEHAR : -- that shes getting her tips from Sarah Palin. And Sarah went in there and backed her up, right? Whos nuttier do you think, Christine or Sarah? @!SEKOFF : Well, you know actually, Christine is actually when you look right down to it is even nuttier than Sarah. This is a big win for Sarah she gets to chuck up another win in her endorsement column. But I think the stuff thats going to come out, even a victory is not going to make it go away that -- that she has a record of not paying her taxes. That she has a record about dissembling about what she did -- through other times when he ran against Joe Biden, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, she has a great background Joy, where she first claimed -- her claim to fame is when she came out as an abstinence spokesperson -- @!BEHAR : Oh yes Im glad youre saying that -- @!SEKOFF : -- saying that masturbation -- yes. @!BEHAR : Let me -- let me play the clip because its so much fun to watch. @!SEKOFF : Ok. @!BEHAR : Ok lets play this. @!SEKOFF : Its a good one. @!BEHAR : Yes. @! UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : We need to address sexuality with young people. And masturbation is part of sexuality. But it is important to discuss this from a moral point of view. The Bible says that lust in your heart is committing adultery. So you cant masturbate without lust. Youre going to be pleasing each other. And if he already knows what pleases him and he can please himself, then why am I in the picture? @!BEHAR : Well, Leslie thats her platform -- @!SEKOFF : Why am I in the picture? @!BEHAR : -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rachel Maddows Show " last night. Go ahead Roy. @!SANCHEZ : You know, Im surprised we werent talking about the bad choice there and that was in the spiral perm. I did that in the 90s. It was just really the wrong move there. @!SEKOFF : Yes I know but this is obviously, this is not a good day. Yesterday was not a good day for masturbators, Joy. Clearly this is -- you know, the biggest opponent of masturbation since your seventh grade science teacher told you about the hair on your palms. @!SANCHEZ : Lets be -- now lets -- @!SEKOFF : Its not -- its not a good day for the self-pleasurer. @!SANCHEZ : -- lets put it in perspective, I do nt think its fair, I think its really sad to be criticizing someone for their religious beliefs. I mean -- @!SEKOFF : No, no, look, thats not -- thats not necessary -- @!SANCHEZ : -- Rachel Maddow may not agree with that -- that she created an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!BEHAR : She needs to watch some porn and gets some tips. Thats what she needs. @!SEKOFF : Leslie -- exactly. Leslie she was still -- Leslie she was still on the Web site as of last year as one of their spokespeople. And theres a difference -- were not criticizing the religious beliefs. But youve got to say that -- @!SANCHEZ : Youre not? How are you not? @!SEKOFF : Im telling you exactly that Im not. @!BEHAR : Oh come on. @!SEKOFF : Theres a lot of Christian people who I understand who like sex and do nt think that just because you masturbate, you do nt need a woman. @!BEHAR : Thats right. @!BEHAR : Leslie, come on. Christians masturbate just like everybody else. But were going to continue with this in just a minute. @!BEHAR : Im back with my political panel. Let me ask you something, Leslie. Is the Tea Party going to be a third party in the whole system now? Could that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way Nader was to Gore in that last election against Bush. I mean do nt you think that that will hurt the GOP if theres a third party? @!SANCHEZ : I think if you look at what the Tea Party supports, in most cases, theyre talking about economic health of this country. Increased deficits, concerned about the direction of the country and their political and their private liberties. Thats whats important. Theyre not talking too much social issues. Its economic across the board. You have to acknowledge the trend. And I think to the effect that youre seeing a lot of independent voters have moved toward Republicans on economic issues, the deficit issues -- @!BEHAR : Yes. But you say its economic only. I do nt get that. This Christine ODonnell -- she is against abortion. Shes against masturbation. Shes against stem cell research. Shes against gay rights. I do nt see that theyre only fiscally responsible people in there. @!SANCEZ : I will tell you that what is resonating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressive, where people are playing in these tight margins is these independent voters, voters who are mobilized and engaged and theyre looking more at economic issues more than the social issues. @!BEHAR : Right. @!SANCHEZ : And theyre also favoring GOP newcomers. They want -- were in the era of kick the bums out. Republican or Democrat, I think anybody whos an incumbent right now has a problem. @!BEHAR : Well, thats kind of irrational in my opinion. Roy, isnt this the best thing that could happen to Democrats? These Tea Party candidates? @!SEKOFF : Listen, the GOP is clearly having this identity crisis. We have the establishment figures on the one side. We have the insurgents on the other. The question is, are the Democrats going to be able to capitalize on it or are they going to blow it? We have to admit, they cant just say, shes an easy win. They cant just talk that up. There is a great energy. When they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about voting. The numbers on the GOP side are way, way, way above the Democrats. What are the Democrats going to do to energize their base? They cant just sit back and let a candidate like ODonnell and hope she implodes. @!BEHAR : Whats your advice Leslie to the Democrats? What should they do? @!SANCHEZ : They need to start talking about the economy. They need to understand that when people are out of work they forget party affiliation. Theyre not Republican ; theyre not Democrat. Theyre looking for a job. That has always been the focus. Thats what a lot of these candidates are talking about, the ones who are surging. @!BEHAR : What did the moderates in the GOP make of the point that -- you know, get the government off my back, get them out of my bank book? Everything -- I do nt want any government. Basically the Tea Party is against government but then they say, do nt touch my Medicare, do nt touch my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do they reconcile those two disparate ideas, Leslie? @!SANCHEZ : Theres a little bit of both. I mean, the party of( INAUDIBLE), there is libertarian -- I mean you have a lot of folks who do nt want the government involved in it. Theyre very concerned about the mass growth of the federal government and its implications on your personal life. Theyre very real concerns. And look at the state and theyre pushing back as well. @!BEHAR : I never understand that Roy. You know, its like theyre worried about infringements on their personal life. But when it comes to abortion, when it comes to gay rights, theyre right up there in your business. I do nt understand. Its such a confusing party, the GOP, to me. @!SEKOFF : Theres no consistency. Theres no consistency there. Its the same way as saying the most important thing is cutting the deficit until it comes to extending the Bush tax cuts for millionaires. @!BEHAR : Yes. @!SEKOFF : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its crazy. @!SANCHEZ : Were a vast umbrella of many issues. @!BEHAR : Ok. Thanks guys, very much. This just will go on and on, this conversation. Up next, Mel Gibson goes incognito with a fake mustache. I wonder if he went with the Groucho or the Stalin. Well find out. @!BEHAR : Celebrities handle paparazzi differently. Some stars scream at them and others like Sean Penn punch them and kick their cars. But Mel Gibson is different. He is crafty. He tries to fool them by going into disguise. Look at this picture, OK, who is he kidding with that disguise. OK with me to discuss this and more are comedian Kevin Meaney, Daphne Rubin Vega, co-star of the new film " Jack Goes Boating. " And Natalie Thomas, deputy editor for " US Weekly. " OK you know, guys, why is he in disguise? Is he feeling guilty? Does he - he does nt want to get recognized obviously? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate him on the street? Anybody, Kevin? @!KEVIN-MEANEY-COME : I think he s got these great disguises. But he should do something else. @!BEHAR : Like what? @!MEANEY : You know like, for instance, what I do, I do nt know if he s ever considered dressing in womens clothes. @!BEHAR : Well that could be next. @!MEANEY : And thats something I have done myself to -- @!BEHAR : And you brought us a picture? @!MEANYE : Yes, I actually bought a picture, there is a picture up there - @!BEHAR : Lets see, there you are. @!MEANEY : There I am. Im not in full disguise, but Im preparing to disguise myself. And then I wear a red burqa on top of that. @!BEHAR : So slenderizing that thing. @!MEANEY : Well its actually a fat suit. Its a fat suit, part of it yes. Yes, so, Im not that heavy. But with the red burqa, really, you cant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daphne, why do you think he s disguising himself? Do you know the story of the kind of verbal abuse towards the wife -- @!DAPHNE-RUBIN-VEGA, : Right. I heard something about the rant. And he was talking about how hed never go out looking like that. So if he dressed in drag, then you know, all the -- just the bad advice that he gave her and the threats would come back to him. @!MEANEY : Uh huh, do you think hed look good in that red dress? @!RUBIN-VEGA : You know, you must be very - @!MEANEY : Were the same age. @!BEHAR : Let me just refresh your memory on what the rants were. @!RUBIN-VEGA : Uh huh. @!BEHAR : He called Oksana a whore and " c " word. He said you look like an f-ing pig in heat and if you get raped by a pack of " n " words it would be your fault. He s a real charmer. If I were him, I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I mean he s clearly not a man - he s not all there. Like he s clearly lost it. He needs to be not going out in disguise, not following paparazzi and confronting them. He needs to go somewhere and work on himself and take care of his issues and lay low. And not be out and about in L.A. I do nt think its the place for him. @!MEANEY : But did nt he go up to the paparazzi car with his phone camera and say, you know, and they did nt recognize him at first. And then they started interviewing him saying, you know, what did you really mean that to your wife? Did you really say these things to her? @!BEHAR : Well I know that they, the paparazzi also said, do you think youll ever make a movie in Hollywood again? They asked him that which is really the crucial question. @!RUBIN-VEGA : And what it did he say? @!BEHAR : I do nt know, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said, do you have a response to that? He said, not to you. And then he said, how does it feel to go around sniffing other peoples laundry. Yes so he was kind of attacking the paparazzo for his job. But you know, Mel has not right to be judging people -- @!MEANEY : O but did nt he just doing a movie with Nell though? @!RUBIN-VEGA : I think they are friends. I mean like this is the time when he needs his friends. Clearly -- @!MEANEY : No that was the movie " Nell. " That was the movie " Nell. " @!BEHAR : You mean the movie about the deaf girl? Where did that come from? @!MEANEY : No he just did a movie with Jodie Foster. @!BEHAR : Oh Jodie Foster, who plays Nell. @!BEHAR : You know what the movie is called " The Beaver. " @!MEANEY : " The Beaver. " @!BEHAR : I kid you not. " The Beaver. " @!MEANEY : How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that title from? @!MEANEY : From one of his rants. @!BEHAR : OK lets change - lets change the topic. Kate Gosselin OK is adding a nine to her plus-eight. Kate is reportedly mentoring Bristol Palin for her upcoming appearance on " Dancing With The Stars. " Now why would Bristol take dancing advice from a woman who looks like shes dancing on hot coals when she is walking and dancing. Why? @!RUBIN-VEGA : Admittedly, its not about dancing. It has nothing to do with dancing. Its about selling yourself. @!THOMAS : Kate herself said, reportedly, that its a popularity contest and that Bristol needs to do it up. @!BEHAR : And take tips from Sarah Palin. Like what kind of tips could Sarah Palin might have -- her do you think? @!MEANEY : Well stay away from Jon Gosselin, thats for sure. @!BEHAR : Yes, yes. @!MEANEY : So I do nt know if he was -- was he in the background trying to pick up Bristol Palin? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!BEHAR : That is sick. @!MEANEY : It could happen. @!BEHAR : This is what she said. Kate reportedly told Bristol to sell the performance, even if your feet are a mess. What kind of advice is that to give the girl, to destroy had her feet? @!MEANEY : What does she have, athletes foot? @!BEHAR : To be on " Dancing With The Stars. " Thats the advice shes giving her. @!THOMAS : Again if its Kate Gosselin giving you advice, maybe not the one to be taking the advice from. @!BEHAR : I know well theyre both good, theyre both single mothers. @!THOMAS : True. @!BEHAR : You know, they have both got knocked up plenty and theres no man in the room. They have that in common. @!RUBIN-VEGA : Sorry, I did nt mean to interrupt. @!BEHAR : Thats fine. @!RUBIN-VEGA : Its like the fascination with -- @!BEHAR : Kate. @!RUBIN-VEGA : Trashy. @!BEHAR : Shes very popular. I understand you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " People " magazine? @!RUBIN-VEGA : She is. @!MEANEY : Well I saw her show on the other night, " KATE PLUS EIGHT. " It is you know -- @!BEHAR : What do you like about it? @!MEANEY : Well my daughter likes to watch it. So you know, because she is an only child and her father dresses up in womens clothing. @!BEHAR : Im sorry for the child. Poor little thing. @!MEANEY : What are you doing tonight, daddy? I was just trying on little dresses honey. Let me get back to you later. @!BEHAR : OK youre putting aside some money for the therapy is what I want to know. @!MEANEY : But its interesting looking into somebodys life, you know, that has all these kids. And its like, oh my god, theyre going on another vacation. Theyre always going places. @!BEHAR : Yes. @!MEANEY : Its kind of fun to watch the kids go to these places and you know dream about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!BEHAR : OK the next one, a British judge sends singer George Michael to jail for a DUI, giving him eight weeks in the slammer. OK, he was also -- he was once arrested for engaging in a lewd act with a man in a public toilet. So sending him to jail with a bunch of guys is a win-win. @!MEANEY : This is heaven, this is absolutely heaven. @!BEHAR : Its a win, win. I mean what do you think about that. @!MEANEY : I always dreamed of going to jail you know when I was younger so I wouldnt have to come out. You know so I could be in jail with men. You know that was my fantasy at one time, you know. And now Im out so I do nt have to go to jail. You know but he was high on the pot. @!BEHAR : He was on the pot. @!MEANEY : He was on the pot. @!BEHAR : Listen, how do they know you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- your eyes are bloodshot. @!BEHAR : Yes. @!MEANEY : And -- @!BEHAR : Always? Not always. @!MEANEY : Yes. And probably he was smoking the pot in the car. @!BEHAR : He was smoking the pot. When they opened the window, smoke comes out? @!MEANEY : Yes when they open the window, smoke comes out. He s like hey, what happen. @!THOMAS : They also said there was prescription drug usage. So they had to have tested him to know to some extent there was prescription drugs and marijuana. @!MEANEY : Oh they can test you, they can test your hair. Thats why a lot of the people shave their heads when they go in for a drug test. Obviously I do nt do that. You do nt need a drug test when youre doing stand-up comedy. @!BEHAR : youre full of information tonight. @!MEANEY : Yes, thank you. Thank you. @!BEHAR : Thats very good. Now he was sentenced to eight weeks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to Lindsay, how many weeks will he actually -- @!RUBIN-VEGA : What the -- this is in London, is that right? @!THOMAS : They actually said that he s serving four weeks in jail and serving four weeks on parole. @!MEANEY : Yes. @!THOMAS : So whether he actually serves all those four weeks remains to be seen as well. @!MEANEY : Can he smoke pot while he s on parole? @!BEHAR : I do nt think so. @!RUBIN-VEGA : Does he get a bracelet, jewelry to go beep? @!MEANEY : What about a pot brownie? Do they have a pot brownie. @!BEHAR : Well its hard to detect a pot brownie. @!MEANEY : No of course you can detect a pot brownie. @!BEHAR : No you cant. @!MEANEY : You do nt know anything about pot. Its in the blood. @!BEHAR : I despise marijuana. I need a drug to increase my appetite? No, I do nt need that aggravation. @!RUBIN-VEGA : And makes you paranoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that he was on the pot for a long time. @!MEANEY : Yes, yes, he was. @!BEHAR : So he s open. I mean, he would just say, Im on the pot. @!MEANEY : And then that whole thing about him going into the bathrooms -- @!BEHAR : And be and the pot. @!MEANEY : Look for other prisoners. Its like he wanted to go to jail. @!BEHAR : Yes. @!MEANEY : He would go in on the pot and then like look for something going to the bathroom and say, do you want to come back you know, to my pot place and smoke more pot and have gay sex. @!BEHAR : OK theres one more story. @!RUBIN-VEGA : I miss his voice though. Come on. @!BEHAR : You do. @!MEANEY : Oh he has a beautiful voice. You ever hear him sing in the bathroom? @!BEHAR : Universal Orlando is expanding some seats on it its Harry Potter and the forbidden journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to Dunkin Donuts. Why do nt they tell people to just lose weight? Its very unhealthy. @!MEANEY : I want to get on the Harry Potter ride. How come I cant get on the Harry Potter ride? @!RUBIN-VEGA : Lets shame you before you get on the ride. No, fatties. You know -- youre too fat. @!BEHAR : But are nt they enablers? It seems like theyre enablers. @!RUBIN-VEGA : Well Jetblue does it. Should you not ride in an airplane because youre overweight? @!BEHAR : Well because theres a crazy guy running the airplane. All right thanks guys, well be back in a minute. @! UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : Hey. I thought you were supposed to be studying for your cooking exam. @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : I am. @!UNIDENTIFIED-FEMAL : How can you do on two things at once? @!UNIDENTIFIED-MALE : Havent you heard at shake and bake? @!BEHAR : John Ritters unexpected death at age 54 from an aortic dissection in 2003, shocked his fans, his friends and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their then 5-year-old daughter, Stella. Amys new memoir, " With Love And Laughter : John Ritter, " is a touching story. Here with me now is Amy. Welcome to the show. @!AMY-YASBECK-AUTHO : JOHN RITTER " : Hi Joy, thank you. How about that outfit John had on? @!BEHAR : Yes. @!YASBECK : He took all that stuff home and tried to squeeze into it when he was older and more muscular. He had everything @!BEHAR : He was a funny, funny guy. @!YASBECK : Funny, funny. @!BEHAR : Very adorable. People were very upset when he passed away. @!YASBECK : People took it very personally, like he was someone in their family. @!BEHAR : Let me go back to the fact that you met him when you were in high school? Did you ever -- @!YASBECK : No I did nt meet him when I was in high school. @!BEHAR : No I mean you saw him on TV, sorry. @!YASBECK : Exactly, in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high school. @!BEHAR : And you fell for him while you were watching him? @!YASBECK : You know what, fell for him, get it, Ritter going pluck. @!BEHAR : Got it. @!YASBECK : By Joy Behar, ladies and gentlemen. @!BEHAR : I use to watch Ed Sullivan and I was turned on by him. But this is a whole new - kidding. @!YASBECK : I heard Ed had a really big shoe. @!BEHAR : Really? You never know. @!YASBECK : I thought John was - @!BEHAR : So there you are - @!BEHAR : Wait lets put the picture. Here you are. Where are you? What city? @!YASBECK : New Ash, outside of Cincinnati, Ohio, with my mom and dad on the couch. And every time the show would start -- @!BEHAR : How old are you? @!YASBECK : Lets see. Then? @!BEHAR : Back then, yes. @!YASBECK : I think it was the 70s so I was an embryo probably. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I cant do the math. @!BEHAR : OK, so you were a teenager. @!YASBECK : Lets call it teenager, tween as they call it now. @!BEHAR : Tween. @!YASBECK : Anyway, so I was sitting on the couch with my mom and my dad, and every time the show would start, my mom was somehow compelled to explain the premise every time. See, he s living with them. The reason he can live with them is the reason that he s gay. She would say gay because that was a new fabulous PC word for her. God knows what she said before gay. Because he s pretending to be gay. Do you understand? Im like, yes, mom. That was so embarrassing. @!BEHAR : So she would keep explaining it to you? @!YASBECK : Yes. And my dad would laugh. But then there was the first time there were girls, Suzanne and Joyce jumping around without their bras, jumping around. It was very hot stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!BEHAR : Well there was a menage a trois. People use to think they were having, the three of them. I mean I was -- @!YASBECK : Oh, they were. Were youre talking about on the show? @!BEHAR : Youre funny. Are you a comedienne? @!YASBECK : No, Im not, Joy Behar. @!BEHAR : You should be, you might want to do that. @!YASBECK : All right I will. @!BEHAR : But he should be, what kind of crazy things did he do at home? @!YASBECK : At home, you know, the things our dad and grandpa would do, oh, dad. But John did -- he never got a drink without a straw in it, go like this get it stuck in his nose and then just be turning around and say, come on, come on. Or when he would eat, home, away, it did nt matter. He would on purpose get something huge stuck somewhere. And then he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have I got it? @!BEHAR : He was a clown. He was just a clown husband type of guy, fun. @!YASBECK : He was a clown husband. Honk, honk. @!BEHAR : You know what I mean. Now your daughter Stella was born September 11th, 1998. @!YASBECK : Yes. @!BEHAR : What was John like as a daddy? Was he wacky with the kids too? @!YASBECK : Absolutely wacky and fun. @!BEHAR : He was. @!YASBECK : Of course, I got to see him with his three big kids. He was always fantastic and available and go for it with them. And with Stella, she only got him for five years. But she -- shes like a sponge. She absorbed so much of him. And I know thats because of the nature of who had her dad is. So much has got to be what she saw and what she observed. We lived here for a year. She remembers stuff about New York that when she was two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty memorable guy. @!BEHAR : He was a memorable guy that must have been quite a loss for her, my god. @!YASBECK : Absolutely. @!BEHAR : And she -- he passed away on September 11th. Right? @!YASBECK : Her birthday. @!BEHAR : Yes, on had her birthday. And September 11th is such a loaded date anyway for you. @!YASBECK : Forget it. @!BEHAR : Yes, so tell me what happened that night. @!YASBECK : It was actually in the day. We were supposed to go to a school. John and I were supposed to go to her back to school day. He fell ill at work, stomach pains and stuff and was taken into the emergency room across the street from where he was working it was erroneously treated for a heart attack that he wasnt having. And he died from a tear in the aorta, as opposed to a block an in the heart. So you can imagine all the treatments were in the opposite thing. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with god and John as my witness, I swear its getting less and less. Because my family -- I, so many people in the community about vascular disease community have taken great pains to see other families do nt go through what Stella and our family did. @!BEHAR : Of course. Can we say lawsuit? @!YASBECK : Sure. @!BEHAR : Was there one? @!YASBECK : There was a lawsuit, yes. @!BEHAR : Thats pretty bad. @!YASBECK : Yes. Its a huge thing. But since then, its almost like pre-John Ritter, which he fell into, and then theres post John Ritter. And I talk to people all the time, they write me and they call me. Im way, way too accessible. But I do nt care. @!BEHAR : Yes. @!YASBECK : And people say, I was saved in the emergency room because I was having these weird pains and gripping thing. And they said, it might be you have a cough. And then theyd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said did they check you for the John Ritter thing. @!BEHAR : Wow. @!YASBECK : And the doctor, and some of them were kind of shamed into it. Well all right well give you a CT scan if you want to pay for it. And by god they have a giant aneurysm, which is what happens first. Your aorta is the tube that you know takes everything from the heart into the rest of your body. @!BEHAR : Right. @!YASBECK : And its like if you have a bubble in your tire of your car. You do nt look at it and go, that will go down. Ill drive to Las Vegas. No, you fix it. @!BEHAR : Right. @!YASBECK : Well, thats what the aneurysm -- @!BEHAR : Youre doing good work with that, making people aware. Stay right there. @!YASBECK : Oh Im not going anywhere, Joy Behar. @!BEHAR : Because well continue this in just a minute, youre very cute. @!YASBECK : Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author of a loving new memoir about her late husband, John Ritter. Tell me about the John Ritter Foundation for Aortic Health is what it is called. @!YASBECK : Exactly, after John died, of course, job one was of course, be Stellas mom and be a whole human being and not just weeping and that. Hard to do and working on it still. Job number two, almost as important as to be able to get the message out there. So I started the John Ritter Foundation for Aortic Health. @!BEHAR : Right. @!YASBECK : At the time, all it was, was me doing Google alerts for aortic dissection and John Ritter and just calling random families. I would just call people to get them into a genetic study. Because it is genetic. Which in the minute you hear that, OK, you say, if somebody has it, and I found out youre 20 percent more likely to have an aortic aneurysm dissection if somebody in your family has it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!BEHAR : Yes. @!YASBECK : Why are nt we talking about that 20 percent. So I would just call families and read Id like read an obituary from Kansas City and call people up, I know its only a week since your son died or your grandmother died but I need to talk to your family. @!BEHAR : Wow, you did that? @!YASBECK : And sometimes, yes, I did. I did it up all night and cried. Because it was like I talked to so many families. And I never really wanted to be a widow. I did nt want to be John Ritter widow. I wanted to be his wife. @!BEHAR : Yes. @!YASBECK : But when I would call, hey, this is John Ritters widow. They had just heard -- this is any age. Aortic Dissection is at any age. @!BEHAR : At any age. @!YASBECK : So your child has just died. What did he die from? Its the thing John Ritter died from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John. @!BEHAR : Its good to put the name to it. @!YASBECK : And they felt they were part of communities. So our family wrapped our arms around these people, carried them to the University of Texas, the UT Health Center. @!BEHAR : Yes. @!YASBECK : And I have teamed up and now its the John Ritter research program at UT health. @!BEHAR : Uh huh, thats great. @!YASBECK : Theyve discovered genes. You can get tested. @!BEHAR : Who was John -- where was the genetic connection with him such. @!YASBECK : Well heres the thing. Because his brother, Tommy -- we had Tom scanned. And we found the -- " we " -- the doctors and I. But seriously, it takes a village. They found it. It was fixed, completely replaced. They think Tex Ritter, who was Johns dad, the singing cowboy. @!BEHAR : Oh yes, Tex Ritter. @!YASBECK : Because he died of a heart attack, air quotes -- @!BEHAR : He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Right. @!YASBECK : Well yes when they talk about statistics for aortic dissection. So many I know people we know and I know youre Italian. @!BEHAR : Im Italian. @!YASBECK : Im Lebanese. We have all these relatives we do nt know what exactly where we are. But we know Aunt Sophie died of a massive heart attack. But its not autopsied. @!BEHAR : Right. @!YASBECK : Its not - so when its a cardiac event, or it could be an aortic dissection, they do nt know what it is, we put it in the cardiac category. So its way more prevalent than people think. @!BEHAR : I think its fantastic what youre doing. @!YASBECK : Thanks, Joy. @!BEHAR : Really incredible. @!YASBECK : Thank you. @!BEHAR : We have to go. @!YASBECK : Thats crazy. Im insulted. Lets see what my mood ring says. My mood ring says -- @!BEHAR : Im sorry. You have to come back. I think you have a career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all? @!YASBECK : I am an actress at all. And Mel Brooks likes me. Half Lebanese and half Irish. That equals one whole Jew. He did, Mel tell her. @!BEHAR : I wish Mel would come on the show. @!YASBECK : Do you want me to tell him to -- - @!BEHAR : Yes, he wont come? @!YASBECK : No, I know where he eats on Tuesdays. I do. @!BEHAR : OK, the book is called " With Love And Laughter, John Ritter. " Goodnight, everybody. Buy it.
