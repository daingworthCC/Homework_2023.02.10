236841 ROBERT @!SIEGEL, host : Back in the late 1960s and early ' 70s, when the United States was fighting in Vietnam, college students across the country often staged anti-war protests. Many of them had a personal stake in doing so. They faced the prospect of being drafted and sent to Vietnam. There has n't been a draft for 25 years, and over the last two weeks, public support for sending American ground forces into the Kosovo conflict has grown. That may explain why American college campuses have been remarkably quiet. Some universities have responded to the conflict in Yugoslavia not with protests but with teach-ins. NPR 's David Welna has this report. @!DAVID-WELNA-report : It 's a gorgeous spring afternoon on a grassy mall at Notre Dame University in South Bend, Indiana. A crowd of students stand about, their bodies absorbing amplified music that five fellow Notre Dame students are performing on a small stage. Looking at their smiling faces, you would never know that across the Atlantic American planes are dropping bombs on Yugoslavia. But there 's a reminder here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Behind the band loomed four yellow limestone monoliths surrounding a steel globe. Notre Dame 's former president, Father Theodore Hesburgh, commissioned this structure as a monument to peace. Father THEODORE HESBURGH : This monument is dedicated to over 500 Notre Dame graduates who gave their lives in the last four wars. @!WELNA : Standing at a tall window 13 stories above the students and the peace monument, Father Hesburgh peers down at the scene below his office in the Notre Dame library. @!Fr-HESBURGH : We have that monument there to remind everybody that peace is ultimate goal, not war. And they certainly hear enough times around here that you 're not going to get peace without justice. @!WELNA : The philosophy of first justice, then peace imbues a midday teach-in at Notre Dame billed at the ABC 's of the Kosovo Crisis. Speaking to several dozen students and teachers who 've opted to learn more about the Balkans conflict rather than soak up the warm sunshine outside, international relations Professor Alan Dowdy defends what he calls humanitarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) : When 5,000 troops in Rwanda a few years ago could have saved half a million lives, nobody lifted a finger. It 's lack of will. That does n't mean that when a case comes along and that will can be mobilized that that makes it wrong because it 's inconsistent with past behavior. @!WELNA : But others on the teach-in panel are critical of US policy in the Balkans. Gil Loescher, a government professor who 's an expert on refugee issues, argues that plans to airlift Kosovo refugees to temporary refuges around the world will vastly complicate the goal of getting them back to the homes they fled. Professor GIL LOESCHER( Notre Dame) : It is very difficult to return people once they have been relocated in far-away countries, particularly in this case where you 're talking about crossing oceans and continents. Of the roughly 1.3 million people displaced from their homes in Bosnia during the Bosnian conflict, only 80,000 have been able to return to their homes, despite the return of refugees being guaranteed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veers towards Russia and its highly critical stance in the conflict. Professor Martha Merritt, a Russian scholar who 's been in close touch with her contacts in Moscow, says the response to NATO 's bombing of Slavic Serbia is the most explosive reaction she 's seen in Russia in the last two decades. She sites a recent incident which she says illustrates much wider Russian sentiment. Professor MARTHA MERRITT( Notre Dame) : A very famous actor in Russia, Andrei Andronnikov dressed himself as an ancient Slavic warrior, got on a horse and a couple of days ago fired an arrow at the residence of the American ambassador in Moscow. He was not arrested. He escaped on his horse. But the arrow said -- the arrow had a message wrapped in it, and it said, When you spill Slavic blood in Serbia, the final bloodshed will be in America. ' @!WELNA : A man in the audience poses a pointed question to the panel. Unidentified Man 1 : Assume each of you gets a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, What can you recommend we do next? ' what would you recommend? @!Prof-MERRITT : Is this a collect call? @(Soundbite-of-laugh) @!WELNA : Russia 's scholar Merritt says advice would be not to underestimate the righteousness Serbians feel about their cause of keeping control over Kosovo. @!Prof-MERRITT : You probably know that both Clinton and Madeleine Albright released statements to the Serbian people, you know, that they seem to think would make people say, Oh, so this has been a mistake. OK. You know, let 's be American. ' So I think there was a lot of naivete about what the reaction to this bombing campaign would be. @!WELNA : Merritt 's colleague Alan Dowdy offers his advice for NATO 's commander. @!Prof-DOWDY : I would follow the dispatch of the Apache helicopters to Albania by continuing to build up ground forces in order to provide an option. In the Gulf War, despite the total air superiority of the coalition forces, in the end, to get Iraq out of Kuwait, you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students in the audience are skeptical about sending in ground forces. Aaron(ph) O'Connell, who 's an active duty Marine Corps captain, as well as a graduate student, says after the teach-in, that using ground troops in Yugoslavia may not be so simple. Captain AARON O'CONNELL( US Marine Corps) : When the Nazis were there for five, six years, they never really quelled the uprising there because people hid in the mountains, they had networks and -- none of that was addressed. It was just, Well, we have the money, so therefore, we can go in. ' @!WELNA : A senior biochemistry major from Ohio, Dan Santone, says he was surprised by what he calls the teach-in 's bellicose spirit, especially since it was partly organized by Notre Dame 's Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies. @!Mr-DAN-SANTONE-@1S : Personally, I 'm a pacifist, and I hate to see conflict reach this level. I guess, to a point, I was kind of looking to see if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!WELNA : If the overall bias at Notre Dame 's teach-in was to support military action against Yugoslavia, there 's a tone much more critical of that action at a late evening teach-in organized by the Young Republicans Club at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. Slavic languages and literature Professor Andrew Wachtel, tells about 150 students that bombs are falling on Yugoslavia because Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic balked at the recent Ramboulliet peace deal, which Wachtel says could have led to Kosovo seceding from Serbia. Professor ANDREW WACHTEL( Northwestern University) : He did n't turn it down because he was a bad guy ; he turned it down because it was an absolutely unacceptable deal. No sane person could have possibly accepted this deal. And when he turned it down, we had no other plan except to bomb him because it had never occur to us that we should offer a reasonable deal or even think about what a reasonable deal might be. And so we commenced this completely futile campaign. @!WELNA : But when Wachtel questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken by most estimates some 2,000 lives in the last year, an ethnic Albanian student from Kosovo stands up and defends NATO 's having come to the rescue of his fellow Kosovars. Unidentified Man 2 : Two thousand people is a lot. It 's incredible, a lot, you know. @!Prof-WACHTEL : Two thousand people is a lot, but if we 're going to go in by the numbers, there 's at least 10 places in the world we should have been in before -- long before that, where their numbers are gigantically higher. Man 2 : But it 's not 2,000 in, like, 300 million. It 's 2,000 in less than two million. @!WELNA : Across the aisle from the Kosovar, a Greek student jumps up to charge that ethnic Albanians in Kosovo are really trying to fuse their territory into a greater Albania, even though they claim they simply want autonomy. Unidentified Man 3 : This was an internal issue of a sovereign country and it should have been let at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital was Adolf Hitler and it 's happening again now. @!WELNA : That remark brings a swift response from a student who says she 's Jewish. Unidentified Woman : I sit and I watch Holocaust movies and the only thing that I can think is how can -- how could this happen? And I know that this is happening all over the world in different places, but I see pictures from Kosovo every morning in my paper and I ca n't stomach it. And I know this is not a humanitarian issue, it 's not -- that 's not where it started and there 's -- you know, we screwed up, we should n't have offered such a stupid treaty. It 's happening, and I ca n't be -- help but be reminded. I do n't know what the answer is. All I can say is... Man 3 : There is no beautiful war. There is no... Woman : Yeah. Man 3 : War is ugly. Woman : So send in ground troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be little support among fellow students for the woman 's call to send in ground troops. Even if there 's no longer a draft, they know it 's people their age who would do most of the fighting on the ground.
