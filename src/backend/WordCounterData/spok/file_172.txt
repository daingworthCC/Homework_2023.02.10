4031641 President Barack Obama moved Monday to remove limits on funding for embryonic stem cell research. Reports continue to emerge about the Obama teams troubles filling open positions at the Treasury Department and other agencies. Analysts and reporters update the story. @!GWEN-IFILL : Good evening. Im Gwen Ifill. On the NewsHour tonight : our lead story, the administration charts a new course on stem cell research ; we look at what happens next when government and science intersect ; then, the rest of the days news, including the latest economic developments ; " Blueprint America, " we continue our series on infrastructure, tonight, troubled mass transit ; and whos minding the store, the understaffed Obama administration. @(BREAK) @!GWEN-IFILL : President Obama cleared the way today for new government spending on scientific research using embryonic stem cells. In doing so, he overturned an 8-year-old ban on government financing for the research first imposed by President Bush. Betty Ann Bowser of our Health Unit has the lead story report. The unit is a partnership with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. @!BETTY-ANN-BOWSER- : President Obama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The move potentially clears the way for scientists to apply for federal money to do research on any embryonic stem cell lines. @!BARACK-OBAMA-Pres : We will also vigorously support scientists who pursue this research. @(APPLAUSE) And we will aim for America to lead the world in the discoveries it one day may yield. Medical miracles do not happen simply by accident. They result from painstaking and costly research, from years of lonely trial and error, much of which never bears fruit, and from a government willing to support that work. @!BETTY-ANN-BOWSER : In August 2001, President George W. Bush allowed federal funding for embryonic stem cell research, but those funds were limited to just 21 stem cell lines that had already been developed. @!GEORGE-W-BUSH-For : Embryonic stem cell research is at the leading edge of a series of moral hazards. @!BETTY-ANN-BOWSER : The key moral issue for President Bush in making that decision : Early-stage embryos that are only a few days old must be destroyed to derive new embryonic cell lines. But scientists have argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morph into specialized cells that could generate new tissues to replace ill or damaged ones in the human body. Today, Mr. Obama sided with those arguments, breaking with his predecessors policy. @!BARACK-OBAMA- : In recent years, when it comes to stem cell research, rather than furthering discovery, our government has forced what I believe is a false choice between sound science and moral values. In this case, I believe the two are not inconsistent. As a person of faith, I believe we are called to care for each other and work to ease human suffering. And many thoughtful and decent people are conflicted about or strongly oppose this research. And I understand their concerns, and I believe that we must respect their point of view. But after much discussion, debate and reflection, the proper course has become clear. The majority of Americans -- from across the political spectrum and from of all backgrounds and beliefs -- have come to a consensus that we should pursue this research, that the potential it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oversight, the perils can be avoided. @!BETTY-ANN-BOWSER : Conservative thinkers and scientists have argued that theres another way to avoid those perils : using federal dollars for research on adult stem cells. Since they are found in developed tissues like bone marrow, embryos do not have to be destroyed. But the president said those alternatives should not limit federal research on embryonic cells. @!BARACK-OBAMA- : At this moment, the full promise of stem cell research remains unknown, and it should not be overstated. But scientists believe these tiny cells may have the potential to help us understand -- and possibly cure -- some of our most devastating diseases and conditions. @!BETTY-ANN-BOWSER : There are limits to todays executive order. It does not address a separate legislative ban, which forbids the use of federal money to do research on human embryos or to create new embryonic lines. To help determine how federal dollars should be allocated, the president gave the National Institutes of Health four months to develop new ethics guidelines for his executive order. Embryonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New Jersey, said President Obamas executive order was a step in the wrong direction. @!REP-CHRIS-SMITH-@1 : Human-embryo-destroying stem cell research is not only unethical, unworkable and unreliable, it is now demonstrably unnecessary. Assertions that left over embryos are better off dead so that their stem cells can be derived is dehumanizing and cheapens human life. @!BETTY-ANN-BOWSER : The president also said todays decision fits into a larger approach his administration would take toward science. @!BARACK-OBAMA- : Lets be clear : Promoting science isnt just about providing resources ; its also about protecting free and open inquiry. Its about letting scientists like those who are here today do their jobs free from manipulation or coercion and listening to what they tell us, even when its inconvenient, especially when its inconvenient. It is about ensuring that scientific data is never distorted or concealed to serve a political agenda and that we make scientific decisions based on facts, not ideology. @!BETTY-ANN-BOWSER : The president signed a memorandum directing his Office of Science Policy to develop a strategy for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. @!GWEN-IFILL : President Obama also ordered a review today of the Bush policy on signing statements. Those are legal documents issued by the president the day a bill becomes law. They include instructions for how the law should be executed. Former President Bush used them to challenge 1,200 provisions during his eight years in office ; thats almost double the number challenged by all the previous presidents combined. The economic outlook in the United States and around the world went from bad to worse today. Ray Suarez has our report. @!RAY-SUAREZ : From the trading floor to the factory floor, 16 months of recession has taken its toll, and theres no end in sight. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett, a self-proclaimed optimist, issued this stark assessment today on CNBC. @!WARREN-BUFFETT-In : Its fallen off a cliff. And not only has the economy slowed down a lot ; people have really changed their behavior like nothing Ive ever seen. @!RAY-SUAREZ : So much that the Dow Jones Industrial Average has plunged 2,200 points since last fall, when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said unemployment will go much higher and a recovery could take five years, but it will happen. @!WARREN-BUFFETT : Business works overall. It does nt work every day or every week or every month, and sometimes it really gets gummed up, and then you need government intervention sometimes to get the machines back working smoothly. But the machine works. @!RAY-SUAREZ : To that end, Buffett, a long-time Obama supporter, urged Congress and the president to do more to restore confidence. That drew a response from White House press secretary Robert Gibbs. @!ROBERT-GIBBS-Whit : I think Mr. Buffett would agree that -- and, in fact, said, in not so many words, but -- that this problem isnt going to be fixed overnight. @!RAY-SUAREZ : None of the talk did much to help the mood on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost another 79 points to close at 6,547. The Nasdaq fell 25 points to close at 1,268. European stocks managed small gains, but Asian markets slumped across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low. The selling followed a World Bank report that the global economy will contract this year for the first time since World War II. The bank also predicted trade will hit its lowest point in 80 years. And in the Financial Times, President Obamas chief economic adviser, Larry Summers, called for greater economic stimulus worldwide. But two leading Republican senators said the Obama administration should instead scale back, at least when it comes to rescuing big banks. @!SEN-RICHARD-SHELBY : Close them down. Get them out of business. If theyre dead, they ought to be buried. We bury the small banks ; weve got to bury some big ones and send a strong message to the market. @!SEN-JOHN-MCCAIN-@1 : I do nt think theyve made the hard decision, and that is to let these banks fail, to let General Motors go into bankruptcy and re-emerge and reorganize with new contracts with labor and others. I do nt think theyve made the tough decisions. Some of these banks have to fail. @!RAY-SUAREZ : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task force met with officials from G.M. and Chrysler in Detroit. And the United Auto Workers union and Ford agreed today on contract changes to save money. @!GWEN-IFILL : Drug-maker Merck and Company announced today its buying rival Schering-Plough for $41 billion. Merck said it wants to cut costs and products amid increased competition and slumping sales. The merger would create the worlds second-largest maker of prescription drugs, but eliminate 16,000 jobs. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled today in two cases affecting future elections. In one case, the court ruled a key part of the Voting Rights Act affects only congressional districts where minorities are the majority. The justices also let stand a lower court decision against state laws that regulate ballot access for independent presidential candidates. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown insisted today Northern Ireland will not go back to the days of sectarian war. On Saturday, Irish Republican Army dissidents shot and killed two British troops outside their barracks in Antrim, west of Belfast. Four civilians were wounded. Prime Minister Brown met today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barracks. @!GORDON-BROWN-Prim : These are callous murderers. These are terrorists who showed no sympathy towards people who were dying. These are callous people who carried out executions in the -- outside these barracks. And I believe the whole population of Northern Ireland is saying what the people of Antrim said yesterday, that these people have got to be hunted down and brought to justice as quickly as possible. @!GWEN-IFILL : Saturdays attack marked the first killings of British troops in Northern Ireland in 12 years. Canadian authorities have confirmed a Canadian soldier was killed in Afghanistan on Sunday. He was part of a NATO force hit by a roadside bombing in the south. The announcement came as the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, General David McKiernan, said the coalition is struggling in the south and the east. He spoke to the BBC. Over the weekend, President Obama told the New York Times he is open to attempts to make peace with elements of the Taliban. A rocket attack in Iraq killed a British soldier today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they will be out of Iraq. U.S. officials announced Sunday the pullout will happen over the next six months. The withdrawals represent 10 percent of the current U.S. troop presence. @(BREAK) @!GWEN-IFILL : Next, growing troubles for public transportation compounded by the economic downturn. New figures out today show Americans relied on public transit in greater numbers last year. The American Public Transportation Association reports that, as gas prices dropped, more than 10 billion trips were taken by bus and rail, the highest level in more than 50 years. But as demand rises, public agencies are feeling the budget pinch. We have a report from " Blueprint America, " our series on infrastructure produced in collaboration with WNET-New York. Special correspondent Rick Karr has the story. @!RICK-KARR : John Hillman spends a lot of time commuting. @!JOHN-HILLMAN-San- : In other words, I spend about 60 hours a month commuting to and from work. Im part of a trend. And this is why investments in public transit are important to people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at the crack of dawn and leaves his condominium in the Bay Area suburbs. He takes a bus to a train to his office at the University of California, San Francisco. @!JOHN-HILLMAN : I save about $100 a month taking transit compared to all of the costs involved in -- if I was to take a car by myself, in terms of bridge tolls, gas, and everything else. And, also, I find it less stressful. My wife and I got rid of one of our automobiles about 18 months ago. We wanted to do it as an experiment. And I think its going to continue indefinitely, as long as theres a transit system still in place. @!RICK-KARR : But in mid-February, the first link in Hillmans transit system started to come undone. @!CHARLEY-ANDERSON- : We may be facing a more serious crisis than was assumed when the F&amp;A Committee made these recommendations, so... @!RICK-KARR : WestCAT, the suburban bus system that carries Hillman from his home to the train station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager Charley Anderson told the board that the only way out was to slash service. @!CHARLEY-ANDERSON : The additional cuts are the serious ones that actually do change the nature of our system. @!RICK-KARR : Minutes later, for the second time in a year, the board voted to cut back. @!DEBBIE-LONG-Commi : Motion second. All those in favor, say aye. @!COMMITTEE-MEMBER : Aye. @!COMMITTEE-MEMBER : Aye. @!COMMITTEE-MEMBER : Aye. @!DEBBIE-LONG-Aye-Se# @!RICK-KARR : WestCAT could have chosen to raise fares instead, but the agency had already done that recently. And commuter John Hillman says it wouldnt take much more of a hike to convince him to stop using public transit. @!JOHN-HILLMAN : You know, if it were to go up to, say, $3 or $4 a trip, then it just really isnt worthwhile anymore. @!RICK-KARR : Cut service, raise fares, or both? Its a dilemma facing more than 60 transit systems across the country as they struggle to deal with rising budget deficits. Washington, D.C.s, system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York, its more than $1 billion. And in the Bay Area, the total is around $200 million. San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom says the transit troubles couldnt have come at a worst time. @!GAVIN-NEWSOM-Mayo : Do nt talk to us about job creation. Do nt talk to us about economic rebound if youre going to cut public transit. Youre simply going to shut off the nozzle that gets people to and from work. @!RICK-KARR : The irony is that mass transit systems nationwide, including San Franciscos Muni, are serving more riders than they have in decades. Sounds like good news, but not necessarily. Heres the problem : The $1.50 that I just dropped into the turnstile isnt nearly enough to cover the cost of the trip Im about to go on. Between labor, electricity, and maintenance, it actually costs Muni more than $6 per trip, which means the agency has to come up with more than $4.50 in subsidies. The new federal stimulus package does nt offer much relief. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment, which wont do much to help transit agencies operate the buses and trains they already have. @!GAVIN-NEWSOM : The biggest concern for all these agencies is operating budgets. The whole idea is to subsidize that economic development, which is absolutely critical to have a public transit feed that economic development in terms of getting people to their jobs. And you want to do it without charging $10 per person to get on a bus. @!RICK-KARR : Transit subsidies come from a combination of local, state, and federal sources. They were more or less stagnant even before the recession hit. That means transit agencies havent had the money they need to run the systems they already have. San Francisco Muni General Manager Nat Ford says this light-rail maintenance shop is a good example. @!NAT-FORD-General- : It opened up in September of 2008, and it is literally going to be the backbone for the future of this transit system here. @!RICK-KARR : You say future tense, " will be. " Is it not fully operational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operational at this point. We had to freeze 465 positions. Of that, 60 positions were directly related to this facility -- maintenance personnel, cleaning personnel -- so were, unfortunately, unable to open up the facility to its full potential at this time. @!RICK-KARR : Fords agency is looking at a deficit thats about one- sixth of its total budget, and things will only get worse as suburban systems like WestCAT cut their service. @!NAT-FORD : I would say every transit system in the Bay Area touches Muni in some shape, form or fashion. And a great deal of our ridership is transfers from those systems. So were very concerned about them, also, and the impact that this economic downturn is having on them. @!RICK-KARR : Lawmakers at the state capital in Sacramento say theres nothing they can do to help. @!CALIFORNIA-LEGISLA : California is on the edge of a financial cliff. @!RICK-KARR : When the state legislature finally passed a budget in mid- February after marathon negotiations, it cut transit subsidies from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugarcoat it. We are going to be trying to put Band-Aids on a very expensive system that actually has more demands and more needs than it ever has, just to get through the next 18 months. @!RICK-KARR : Its going to be bad? @!MARK-DESAULNIER : It will be bad. @!RICK-KARR : Mark DeSaulnier is a state senator who represents the suburbs served by WestCAT buses. He says service cuts will prompt transit riders like John Hillman to stop taking buses and trains and get back into their cars and onto the areas most crowded highway. @!MARK-DESAULNIER : You take that one connection on WestCAT away, and he not only does nt get on WestCAT, he does nt get on Muni. That whole continuum goes away, and he s back in that car fighting for a parking space in one of the most congested metropolitan areas in the United States. @!RICK-KARR : DeSaulnier says transit cuts will be hardest on people who cant afford cars, commuters like Juan Medina. He s a former construction worker whos taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He s studying to be an emergency medical technician. For now, when he leaves campus, he rides a train, then boards a WestCAT bus for the rest of the trip. But one of the cuts that WestCAT proposed was to eliminate buses after 9 p.m. Youre going to end up being stranded 10, 15 miles away from your house. @!JUAN-MEDINA-San-F : Thats right. @!RICK-KARR : What are your options, then? @!JUAN-MEDINA : My options would be either a cab, cab ride. And aside from that, maybe a bicycle, you know? Thats if its not raising, you know, so its pretty limited, you know, for a person that does nt drive. How are you doing today, maam? @!RICK-KARR : Medina was so worried about the proposed cuts that he volunteered to try to get other commuters to speak out against them. @!JUAN-MEDINA : Theres a lot of people that their schedules are nt, you know, a 9:00 to 5:00. You know, they get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you. And, you know, were still as much a vital part of the workforce. @!RICK-KARR : Service cuts can start a downward spiral for transit systems. As buses and trains run less frequently, fewer commuters see the point in waiting around for them, which means less money in the fare box, which means bigger budget gaps. Commuter John Hillman says hell think twice about using public transit if WestCAT has to cut the frequency of its service any further. @!JOHN-HILLMAN : Now its not too bad. If I miss a connection, I only have to wait another 10 or 15 minutes for the next bus or the next BART train to come. But if they were to go to 40 minutes, that would not be good enough. That would make me go out and buy a car. @!RICK-KARR : Congress will have a chance to keep John Hillman and millions of Americans like him commuting by public transit when it takes up a major transportation funding bill later this year. @!GWEN-IFILL : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has affected public transit. @(BREAK) @!GWEN-IFILL : Now a closer look at the policy change on stem cell research and where it fits into the presidents broader approach toward science. We have two views. Dr. Irv Weissman is director of the Institute of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine at Stanford University. He attended todays White House ceremony. And we hope to be joined shortly by Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, a conservative political advocacy group. He, we hope, will be joining us tonight from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. @!Dr-Weissman-I-wan# @!IRVING-WEISSMAN-S : It was a fantastic change, because two things happened. First, the president said, " Im going to let scientists do science. Im going to remove politics, religion, and ideology from that. " The second thing he said is, " Im going to allow all the scientists in the United States to apply for funds to do embryonic stem cell research or pluripotent stem cell research, all the scientists in the United States, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund it. " @!GWEN-IFILL : Well, were going to take this a bit at a time, but lets start by reminding people exactly of what is significant about embryonic stem cell research as opposed to adult stem cell research, which was never prohibited. @!IRVING-WEISSMAN : Right. And I want to start by saying Im an adult stem cell researcher. My lab isolated blood-forming and other tissue- forming stem cells. We were also the ones to show that blood-forming stem cells make blood and nothing else. It is not true that adult stem cells of one type can make another tissue. On the other hand, embryonic stem cells at the earliest stage of development, as they develop in a test tube, can make every kind of tissue. We surmise, then, every kind of stem cell. Theyll allow us to move much faster to find, for example, a lung stem cell, a kidney stem cell, a heart stem cell, a liver stem cell. Those are the stem cells we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have those organs and those tissues regenerated when things go wrong. @!GWEN-IFILL : Whats been the practical effect of this ban that was imposed eight years ago? Is it that all research stopped? Or was it just that it had to come from a different funding stream? @!IRVING-WEISSMAN : It stopped the research on any new embryonic stem cell lines. That meant everybody had to work with those lines which we knew from the beginning, because they were cultured with mouse cells, could be infected with mouse viruses. The second part is that, in places like California where we can do embryonic stem cell research funded by the state, we had to keep completely separate bureaucracies and accounts and new buildings. We wasted a lot money and a lot of time building a new infrastructure that never had a federal dollar in it so that we could do this research. Now all of that will go away. And its nice to see a Democratic president reducing the bureaucracy so that we can do this kind of research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Baton Rouge. @!Mr-Perkins-welcom# @!TONY-PERKINS-Fami : Thank you. Good evening. @!GWEN-IFILL : So give me a sense of what your reaction is to the presidents action today? @!TONY-PERKINS : Well, obviously concerned. Were supportive of science, good science, science that is both ethical and effective. And, you know, very concerned about where science could lead us unbridled by any type of ethical constraints. And so I think its going to be very important what the rules are here, but were still talking about the destruction of human embryos in this embryonic stem cell research. @!GWEN-IFILL : You say unbridled by any ethical research restraints. There is still -- I think its called the Dickey-Wicker amendment on the books, right, which still bans the creation -- use of tax dollars to create or destroy embryos, right? @!TONY-PERKINS : Right. What this does is, I think as the doctor was just explaining, it expands beyond the existing stem cell lines that President Bush limited it to. So it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what I would say is the first step, and I think the doctor would admit that, that this is the first step. There will be, Im sure, a very intense legislative debate over the Dickey-Wicker amendment, whether or not that stays on the appropriations. Thats something that has to be done every year. Its whats called a rider, which has to be assertively put on. Its not automatically there. @!GWEN-IFILL : But do you feel that, with the presidents action today, that makes the chances, especially with Democratic increases in the House and the Senate, that makes it more likely now that that might disappear, as well? @!TONY-PERKINS : I think thats true. I think that, with this step, youre going to see an effort to remove those limitations on the use of tax dollars. And I think, you know, when the Americans look at this and this whole issue, I think this president had a mandate from the voters to address the economic issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues and controversial science such as embryonic stem cell research, I think he loses the mandate of the public. And it certainly does nt do anything to benefit people when it comes to jobs and comes to putting food on the table when were talking about limited research dollars. Were just advocating they be put into good research, research that has produced, such as adult stem cell, which I know the doctor has done. @!GWEN-IFILL : Let me ask Dr. Weissman to respond to that. @!IRVING-WEISSMAN : Well, the first is, when we started doing this kind of research under the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine, Prop 71, we, of course, accepted oversight that had to do with medical ethics and bioethics. So its not true that the president left this now open for unbridled, unethical research. We always know that we are doing what the taxpayer asks us what to do, advanced medical science. @!TONY-PERKINS : And whos going to provide those -- whos going to provide those guidelines? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? @!IRVING-WEISSMAN : Well, the NIH must provide them. The NIH has before. @!TONY-PERKINS : But thats this -- but thats -- what we basically have is the scientists will be deciding what the scientists can do. @!GWEN-IFILL : And who should be? @!TONY-PERKINS : Well, I mean, I think -- I clearly think that the representatives of the people whose tax dollars are being used for this. I mean, but I guess I would ask the doctor, what is too far? I mean, were talking about human cloning. You know, how far can we go? I mean, in terms of -- as he sees this being ethical, how far could we go? @!GWEN-IFILL : Well, let me -- the president did say today that he still opposed human cloning, did nt he? @!IRVING-WEISSMAN : And I was the head of the National Academys panel that said unanimously we should oppose human reproductive cloning because it was, at least from the animal studies, unsafe, dangerous for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to do with cloning. @!TONY-PERKINS : But what about -- well, what about the cloning for... @!IRVING-WEISSMAN : This has to do with... @!TONY-PERKINS : Well, no... @!GWEN-IFILL : Just a moment, Mr. Perkins. Ill get right to you. @!IRVING-WEISSMAN : This has to do with biomedical research. Now, when I want to do embryonic stem cell research with the NIH, I apply with a grant. That does nt mean I get to do it. It means I get to apply to do it. And it will be looked at for its scientific merit, for any medical, ethical issues, any economic issues. So its not true what Mr. Perkins says. @!TONY-PERKINS : Wait a minute. You said that you oppose human cloning for reproduction, but what about human cloning for experimentation? @!IRVING-WEISSMAN : I think that it is critical to find safe and good ways to re-program adult stem cells to the pluripotent embryonic stem cell way. We have two ways... @!TONY-PERKINS : No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Hang on. We have two ways to do it. One is nuclear transfer, which, by the way, if it makes a blastocyst, has very little or no chance of making a human being, so its not going to make a clone. @!GWEN-IFILL : Id like to step in here because I really want to broaden the conversation out, because what the president also said in a separate memo, Mr. Perkins, is that he wanted to -- he called it a false choice between science and moral values. And he s talking about rolling back the entire relationship between government and the scientific community. Do you see this as the beginning of a slippery slope? Or do you see this as something else? @!TONY-PERKINS : Well, again, I think there should be ethical restraints. I do nt think that you can just say, well, the scientists can determine what those ethics are. I mean, can we put human cells into animal cells? I mean, can we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean, how far will we go? Will we make chimeras? What type of research can we do? How long can we allow these embryos to grow before we harvest the stem cells or harvest organs? I mean, those are very real issues that have moral implications which need to be addressed. @!GWEN-IFILL : Dr. Weissman? @!IRVING-WEISSMAN : So we made human-mouse chimeras with blood-forming stem cells, and the FDA said that was a necessary path before we could treat humans. Raising the idea by saying the word " chimera, " that this is something wrong, is false. And what it does is it opens up the idea that there are many areas of research which could lead to medical advances that were going to block because, for some reason, he wouldnt like to have human cells tested in a mouse. @!GWEN-IFILL : What about science beyond just a discussion about human cells and stem cells, Mr. Perkins? This whole idea, the relationship in the last eight years between the administration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly one. Does that change now? @!TONY-PERKINS : Well, I mean, I do nt know. I guess if you let them do whatever they want, then I guess theyre your friend. I do nt know. I mean, we had a very similar debate, you know, with the use of fetal tissue. We were told when Bill Clinton came into office, and he removed the prohibition against the use of fetal tissue, federal dollars to do experimentation on fetal tissue, we had to have fetal tissue. It was going to solve all of these problems. We do nt hear anything about fetal tissue anymore because those that were actually treated when it was approved actually got worse. @!GWEN-IFILL : And there... @!TONY-PERKINS : So just because scientists want to do it does nt necessarily mean its going to work, nor does it mean its right. @!GWEN-IFILL : And there have been questions about broader issues, including climate change, scientific relationship, Dr. Weissman, between the scientists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was changing or is this just a step along the way? @!IRVING-WEISSMAN : Yes. Yes. So what President Obama said is that we will allow scientists and the people who advise the government to present their scientific results unfettered by whatever political implications, whatever inconvenient implications they have. You must remember that those of us who are doing biomedical research, most of us who are MDs have taken an oath to help people as our first priority. And for us to say were going to do research which will help people with many diseases, at least try to help people with many diseases is our first goal. When he says we want to do unbridled research, thats simply untrue. We want to apply to do research that is regulated by our government, by our state, and by our institutions. @!GWEN-IFILL : Dr. Irv Weissman, well leave it there. Thank you very much. And, Tony Perkins, thank you for making the effort to join us tonight. @!TONY-PERKINS : All right. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And still to come on the NewsHour tonight : filling the empty offices in the Obama administration. But first, this is Pledge Week on public television. We are taking a short break now so your public television station can ask for your support. That support helps keep programs like ours on the air. @(BREAK) @!GWEN-IFILL : Next, empty offices and quiet corridors within the Obama administration. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF : As if the weakening economy, other domestic problems, and two wars overseas were not enough for President Obama to deal with, the large number of still-vacant positions across the federal government is complicating matters further. Asked about the unfilled slots today, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said the administrations staffing process is moving forward. @!ROBERT-GIBBS-Whit : Theres a rigorous process involved. We hope that were working with Capitol Hill to ensure that, at the same time theres appropriate rigor and vetting, that theres not in any way any undue delay in ensuring that good people who want to serve their country can get into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more on the causes and the impact of the delays in filling top jobs in the new administration, were joined by New York Times reporter Jeff Zeleny and Paul Light, professor of public service at New York University and author of the book " A Government Ill Executed : The Decline of the Federal Service and How to Reverse It. " Thank you both for being with us. And, Jeff Zeleny, to you first. Youre the one who asked Robert Gibbs that question. Where does the administration stand in terms of filling jobs? @!JEFF-ZELENY-New-Y : Well, the administration is a little frustrated by this. Right now, the numbers, they always say that theyre doing better than previous presidents have, but what they do nt say is their problems are and their challenges are far greater than previous presidents. So some 71 people have been nominated or named for positions. Only 41 of them have been nominated ; only 28 of them have been confirmed. And these are for senior, senior positions. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one administration official I talked to today explained it the best. Its like when you show up to an airport, a security line, all these applicants are standing in line. And if one person does nt take off their shoes, the line grows and grows and grows. And thats exactly what happened with the tax problems of someone like Tom Daschle, someone like a Timothy Geithner, the treasury secretary, so thats what has happened here. So now theyre trying to take steps to sort of speed this process along, which is a challenge. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF : Paul Light, how does this compare with previous administrations weve watched? @!PAUL-LIGHT-New-Yo : Well, Obama is running a little bit ahead of George W. Bush. He s running a little bit behind Bill Clinton. But, you know, all three were remarkably slow. So to say youre ahead of recent presidents is not saying much at all. Youve got a very sluggish process that has become much more burdensome over the last 50 years. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cabinet within about two-and-a-half months of election. Barack Obama will be lucky to have his last appointee in by the first of the year. Its just a terrible process. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF : Jeff Zeleny, tell us how the process works. Whos doing the vetting? Where is it being done? @!JEFF-ZELENY : Well, the vetting now is being done all in the White House counsels office. It was being done by the personnel department before, basically, but now its being done essentially entirely by lawyers, not political people, but lawyers in the White House. And it takes some 65 days from the time that youre named for the position -- at least thats the average -- to the time that you can officially report to work. So the frustrating thing here is -- or the problem here is that some people are not waiting the full 65 days. Some of the qualified people, they believe, who they wanted to work in the administration who were big supporters are not sticking around. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So the reason... @!JUDY-WOODRUFF : Why are nt they sticking around? @!JEFF-ZELENY : Well, because the process is so laborious. So weve heard reports that people who have to find travel receipts from three years ago for a $20 receipt for something. Everyone is essentially being audited. Because of the tax problems of a few secretaries or potential secretaries, everyone is now being very thoroughly audited. And after the Tom Daschle situation, President Obama ordered his lawyers and his team to scrub the taxes of everyone. So that slowed down the process even further. So its being very strict. And, you know, its slowing things down. It has real effects. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF : Paul Light, is the scrubbing process now considerably different from what it was under previous presidents? @!PAUL-LIGHT : Well, there are two things that are affecting it. Number one, there are many more people going through the process today than there were even eight years ago. We keep adding more and more Senate-confirmed appointees to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclosure forms have become more complicated. The Obama administration has a 63-item questionnaire which asks whether or not youve ever sent a controversial e-mail, asks you whether or not you have a Facebook page, and so forth and so on. There are roughly 300 questions that each appointee will be asked. And about two-thirds of them are the same question, with just very small differences in the formation of the answer so that youve got to keep going over and over it again. And thats why about half of the Obama appointees will hire outside help to get them through this process, and many will spend considerable amounts of money to get their tax forms and get ready for the audits that come along as part of this. Its a very serious problem in terms of people pulling themselves out of the process before it even begins and, as Jeff says, people leaving the process once theyre in it. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF : And Jeff Zeleny, clearly theyve toughened this up because of Daschle and Geithners problems. How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the Treasury barely has anybody working there under Secretary Geithner. How bad is it there? And how many problems is it causing substantively for this administration? @!JEFF-ZELENY : Well, I think when you hear people who are very friendly to the president, like a Paul Volcker, you know, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, he said this is a big problem. He really sounded the alarm a while ago. Its one of the reasons the White House on a Sunday morning, at 9 oclock yesterday morning, announced that three people had finally been named to senior positions at the Treasury Department. Its been -- I would say that is the department that has suffered the most of this, at least in terms of a public relations hit. If you talk to people throughout the agencies, they say, look, there are a lot of career people in place here. But it means that a lot of the decisions are being handled at the White House or not handled at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really matters in places like HHS. It matters in, you know, the FDA, other places like that, you know, where some decisions have to be made, but they say, you know, its only March. You know, by May, a lot of these positions should be filled. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF : But, Paul Light, when you overlay the economic crisis over this, it makes it even worse than it looks, does it not? @!PAUL-LIGHT : Absolutely. One thing we need to recognize is that Tim Geithner is not wandering down a deserted hallway waiting for Norman Bates to jump out at him. He s got 50 political appointees working for him who are hired by the president without Senate confirmation. He s got a chief of staff, a deputy chief of staff. Former Clinton economic adviser Gene Sperling is there. He s got an automobile czar, so he s not alone. But he does nt have the Senate confirmed appointees in place, and they are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make decisions, execute policy. And the career civil servants who are absolutely terrific just really do nt feel that they have the authority to execute. Thats the real problem here, that you have this de facto sub-cabinet that operates out of the secretarys office, but you do nt have your true sub-cabinet in place because its stuck on Capitol Hill or its still being audited. So you do nt have the middle vertebrae, the neck, if you will, of government. Youve got the head of the Treasury Department. Youve got the career people. Its kind of neck-less government, if you will. You just do nt have those vertebrae in place to transfer information on down and to move policy ideas on up. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF : Thats certainly one way to think about it. Jeff Zeleny, you were just telling me that people youre talking to inside the White House, inside the executive branch are beginning to express candidly that maybe candidate Obama was maybe a little overzealous in saying he was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theres no question. The central theme of the Obama campaign was to change the way Washington works. Candidate Obama talked a lot about these tough rules on ethics and tough rules on lobbyists. " We will not hire former lobbyists. " Well, when you want to fill this administration -- I talked to an administration official this afternoon who said, look, we have an economic crisis on our hands and two wars. You do nt want people who havent worked in government before. Democrats have not been in power for eight years, so of course some of them have worked in the lobby. So now some real jigsaw-puzzle action is going on here. Someone without worked in the Defense Department, perhaps, or has been a lobbyist now may be looked at for an education job. The rules say you can not work in the area where you lobbied, so the point of these rules seemed good, appealing to Democrats, appealing to voters on the campaign trail, but now theyre having real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said, " You know, should we roll some of these back? " He says, " Absolutely not. " He thinks that would be a hit on his core message. So it makes the office of personnel to go out and recruit people a little more difficult. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF : Less than 20 seconds, Paul Light. Is there a way to fix this? Or do they just need to plow through it? @!PAUL-LIGHT : Cut the number of political appointees. Cut them in half. Get Congress to decide which ones are important. Get the Senate involved and cut the number of appointees. Theyll move faster. Theyll be better. And well get more career people involved in the day-to-day operations of government. @!JUDY-WOODRUFF : All right. We hear you both. Paul Light and Jeff Zeleny, thank you both. Appreciate it. @(BREAK) @!GWEN-IFILL : Again, the major developments of the day. President Obama lifted restrictions on government funding of research using embryonic stem cells.
