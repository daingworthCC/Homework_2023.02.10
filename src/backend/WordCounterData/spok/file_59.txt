230941 DONNA KELLEY, Anchor : Joining us is comedienne Carrie Snow. She 's here in Atlanta for a one-woman show, Carrie Snow 's Real Women- An Interactive Comedy Super Bowl Escape for Women of the ' 90s. Hi, Carrie. CARRIE SNOW, Comedienne : Hi @!KELLEY Good to have you here. Ms. SNOW : Well I 'm thrilled to be here. I 'm a big CNN junkie. I keep it on as background, you know, and it takes me about three or four hours to say, ' Wait, did n't I hear that piece about 15 times already? ' KELLEY : No, no, no. It 's always fresh and updated, though, that 's the point. Hey, listen- Ms. SNOW : You keep believing that, Donna @!KELLEY That 's my line and I 'm sticking to it. So, do you like football, first of all though, or not? I mean, I happen to like football. Ms. SNOW : I think that football is one of the major causes of testosterone poisoning, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night. There are so many hunky-looking men in town @!KELLEY What is wrong with that? Ms. SNOW : No, I think that 's a good thing. No, that 's why I 'm here, actually @!KELLEY I knew it. Ms. SNOW : But a lot of women do n't care about really watching the games. I mean we want to have whoever 's team we like to win so that we can get lucky later. Do n't get me wrong. But we also, you know, want to have our own humor and it does n't really revolve around football. I mean, I do n't understand going to a football game and sitting in the cold for about four hours and getting a bladder infection. You know, it 's like, ' What a picnic. Let 's get season tickets. ' And so I wo n't be going to the football game. I bet I could hustle tickets, though @!KELLEY So you 're going to do a show. You 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ms. SNOW : I 'm doing two shows @!KELLEY OK, two shows. Ms. SNOW : On Sunday at 3:00 and at 7:00 for people that just do n't want to deal with the Super Bowl. What 's really cute is that your little pal here that we 're not supposed to show sitting next to you does n't get tickets. It 's like Mr. Showbiz ca n't get tickets. LEON HARRIS, Anchor : Hey, hey. Ms. SNOW : Hey, hey @!KELLEY We 're talking about Leon who 's sitting right next to us, of course. He 's just right on this side of me. Ms. SNOW : Well, I have to- he 's cute and I have to mention him because black men love me because they think I 've got a small behind @!KELLEY Now, remember where you are here. Ms. SNOW : I said that once at a show and an incredibly handsome black man came up to me afterwards and said, ' No, we do n't. ' That put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I was reading this morning. In fact, you were- should you tell folks what 's on your card and that you 're shopping for a husband? Ms. SNOW : Well, I 'm not shopping at this point. I 'm groveling. But my card used to say, ' Carrie Snow- 7,000 Sailors Ca n't be Wrong. ' But considering it 's the ' 90s and there 's a lot of things out there that perhaps are not safe any more- look, Leon 's laughing now. Oh, good. One person laughs. Now I say it was one naval officer and he talked @!KELLEY Oh, I see. Ms. SNOW : Yeah, it 's much more politically correct, do n't you think? KELLEY : Probably. Ms. SNOW : We have the same color pretend eyes, you know that? KELLEY : Yes, we do. Well I have green eyes, but they have a little bit of tint on the- Ms. SNOW : A little bit of tint? Aqua? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!KELLEY You know, they have a little bit of tint and they are green. Leon is here joining in on some of this too, are n't you? Ms. SNOW : He 's making signals- he 's making hand signals about how- HARRIS : I ca n't stay out of this. You 're just- Ms. SNOW : Donna 's pretended like she was a natural beauty, but- KELLEY : Ouch. My shin, Carrie- Ms. SNOW : -but the idea of being a real women, ' cause the whole idea- it 's more than just the Super Bowl. I 'm going to take this show all around the country because it 's about being a real woman. And a real woman, for example, can have her cake and jump out of it, too. OK? A real woman gets her bikini line waxed before she goes snow skiing, all right? But it 's so much easier being a gal than it is to be a guy, I think. Because with men- HARRIS : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Well because with women there are so many shades of success, you know? With men it 's either success or failure. And with women you can- there are so many options open to us now @!KELLEY Do you think you 're successful, for instance? Ms. SNOW : Oh, yeah. Every day that I get to the airport on time and pick up my cleaning I think I 'm having a great day. No, I am successful, I really am. I do n't have real estate but I have some really nice sweaters @!HARRIS And that 's so much more practical, too @!KELLEY Absolutely. Ms. SNOW : It is and of course I was in Los Angeles for the earthquake and I felt really badly because I was relatively unscathed. My dog was a little bit frightened, but I was going to go up to Northridge and see if I could help, and then I had to calm down. They said that they did n't need any private citizens going up there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really just wanted to eat donuts and meet cute firemen. So I stayed at home @!KELLEY Well, and that was the right thing to do. Where do you get material? Ms. SNOW : From my life. From my silly life. My life is so amusing yet painful, but not life-threatening, you know. And I go to movies. Did you see Shadowlands yet? KELLEY : Not yet. But I saw it as a play and I loved it. I was weeping and weeping- wonderful. Ms. SNOW : It 's the Debra Winger and it 's the C. S. Lewis, and it 's so wonderful but I said I knew it was a fantasy because he was nice to her when she was sick. So, that 's where I get it from @!HARRIS Now, wait a minute. You 're awfully mean to us guys. Come on. Ms. SNOW : That 's where I get it from @!KELLEY No, but she does love men and I wanted to make that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jokes like that is because it 's true, Leon. I mean, you might be right there with a cup of herb tea, but you 're obviously- HARRIS : Hey, there are a lot of us out there who are carrying the torch, trying to be men of the ' 90s. You 're not giving them a break, are you? Ms. SNOW : I think I 'd believe you if you could burst into tears right now @!HARRIS laughs KELLEY : laughs The challenge is laid down here @!HARRIS You ought to see me on the weekends. I 'm pretty good at that @!KELLEY Yeah, when he does n't get to go golfing. Ms. SNOW : When was the last time you cried? HARRIS : Well, let 's see. Probably the day the Browns got eliminated from any chance of making the play offs, but, you know- Ms. SNOW : Well, that was just testosterone overload, once again @!HARRIS That was a very bad weekend, a very bad weekend @!KELLEY You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was reading that you lost a lot of weight- Ms. SNOW : Yes, but I 've been a little thinner- KELLEY : -and that you had a lot of the material- Ms. SNOW : -I 've been a little thinner @!KELLEY But you had a lot of material that went around that and you used to flirt outrageously with some of the men in your audience and as you got thinner, some of the other women did n't appreciate that too much. Ms. SNOW : No, because I guess I actually became a threat when the last thing on the planet that I wanted was to take their trash, you know? It was n't like I wanted somebody 's husband @!HARRIS Hey- Ms. SNOW : Hey, hey, hey @!HARRIS I ca n't sit by here and let you- KELLEY : Settle down, Leon- Ms. SNOW : Are you getting ready to go? Settle down. Look, he 's so- HARRIS : It 's that testosterone poisoning of mine. It 's getting kicked in gear. Ms. SNOW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90s. Let it go, Leon @!KELLEY But you changed some of your material then. Ms. SNOW : I did. I mean- but, you know, when I was much bigger- and I was much bigger and I 've been a little smaller, but I had a TV show that did n't get picked up and it took me a couple of years because I was supposed to make a lot of money and be able to stay home and sleep in my own bed and have a dog. But I got the dog. Somebody said I was doing it in the wrong order, so I got a dog. Of course I 've spent a fortune keeping the dog alive, but I have a crush on my veterinarian so it works out @!KELLEY Oh, do you? Ms. SNOW : Oh, yeah @!KELLEY How handy. Ms. SNOW : And men talk so sweet to you when you have a dog, a cute little dog @!KELLEY I have a chow dog. I think you 're probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? KELLEY : Yeah. Bears and chow dogs are the only animals that have black tongues and this is a big, fuzzy chow dog and you always want to make sure- Ms. SNOW : Are n't men sweet to you? HARRIS : Now, how is that- tell me how that one works. I wonder how that works out. Ms. SNOW : Men are so sweet. The other day I was talking to this guy and he had never met my dog, and he 's trying to be nice to the dog because he wants to get through to me, obviously. And he goes, ' Who wants dinner? Who wants a walk? Who wants a spanking? Who wants a cookie? ' Ms. SNOW : I thought I was in love until I realized he was talking to my dog. It was so sad- it was so sad @!KELLEY I love my dog even if people would n't be nice to me when I was walking the dog- Ms. SNOW : Oh, yeah. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accomplish when you 're here with the show and are you going to stay around any longer? Ms. SNOW : I actually have to go home on Monday because I have to go back up to San Francisco to work on Tuesday, where they think I 'm a comedic genius like Jerry Lewis in France. It 's almost frightening. I could read from the phone book in San Francisco, but- and I have to go home and see my dog for the day. And a friend is taking care of her with his dog, you know, so it works out. And- what do I expect to accomplish? KELLEY : Are you just hoping that you can move somebody? Ms. SNOW : To make a lot of gals happy. Well now, actually, unless he 's willing to commute, you know, Atlanta is a little geographically undesirable- KELLEY : Long distance- Ms. SNOW : -unless he had the cash to really keep me here- kind of like Jane and Ted. Keep me here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!KELLEY Carrie Snow, we 're glad you could join us today. Thanks so much. Ms. SNOW : Am I done now? KELLEY : yes I think you 're done @!HARRIS I know I am. Ms. SNOW : I ca n't believe I shaved my legs for just this couple of minutes..
