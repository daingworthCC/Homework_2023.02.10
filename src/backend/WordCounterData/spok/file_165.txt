4030041 @!SAM-CHAMPION-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) Thanks, Robin. When we think of Christmas, Santa Claus is usually the first guy that comes to mind. But there 's another holiday icon who comes around every winter, the snowman. @GRAPHICS @GRAPHICS @!SAM-CHAMPION-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) Now, he is much more than a corncob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coal. A new book reveals the history that may surprise you. @!SAM-CHAMPION-@1-AB# @(Voiceover) Around this time every year, he makes an appearance, not Santa, the other guy, because this is also the season of the snowman. @!CARTOON-CHARACTER-# How about, Frosty? @!SAM-CHAMPION-@1-AB# @(Voiceover) Frosty the Snowman is perhaps our most famous man of ice. But some say he is not the oldest. @!BOB-ECKSTEIN-@1AUT# No doubt, snowmanmaking is an activity that we shared with our prehistoric ancestors. @!SAM-CHAMPION-@1-AB# @(Voiceover) Humorist Bob Eckstein is author of " The History of the Snowman, " his research revealing these frozen figures throughout time, including the first known illustration of the round guy, drawn for some reason in a 14th century bible manuscript. @!BOB-ECKSTEIN-@1AUT# That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it 's the movies, Eckstein says, where the snowman really gained fame. From his personal collection, this 1940 's flick, one of the icy idol 's first starring roles. @!CLIP-FROM- " JACK-FR# @!SAM-CHAMPION-@1-AB# @(Voiceover) And who ever thought a snowman could have a dark side? Well, this movie features Jack Frost in a frightening rampage. @!ACTRESS-@1FEMALE@2# Just a scar. @!ACTOR-@1MALE@2-# Oh, my god. @!SAM-CHAMPION-@1-AB# @(Voiceover) But later, Eckstein says, the snowman @(inaudible) his image with classics for the entire family. @!CLIP-FROM- " A-CHIPM# CARTOON CHARACTER @(MALE) It 's a Christmas miracle. And in case you get hungry later. @!BOB-ECKSTEIN-@1AUT# He 's even been in, what is considered by many, the greatest movie ever made, " Citizen Kane. " @!CLIP-FROM- " CITIZEN# @!BOB-ECKSTEIN-@1AUT# The snowman, in Orson Welles eyes, he used it as a tool to symbolize innocence, and youth, and childhood. @!SAM-CHAMPION-@1-AB# @(Voiceover) This friendlier snowman 's movie stardom opened a door to becoming an advertising icon. Pitching icy or cold products, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that he was free, royalty free. And in the 11th hour when you could n't find a celebrity or someone to hock a product, you @(inaudible) in the snowman. @!SAM-CHAMPION-@1-AB# @(Voiceover) But what future lies ahead for the advertising pitchman cartoon hero in film and TV legend? @!BOB-ECKSTEIN-@1AUT# I think that it 's time for him to step up to the plate and be a spokesperson for global warming. I think that he 'll definitely get his day in the sun. @!SAM-CHAMPION-@1-AB# @(Off-camera) Who does n't love a snowman? Now, let 's get to Chris, our special Santa correspondent, who gained his experience being a Santa correspondent all over the world. But now, he 's with kids eagerly waiting a man from the North Pole. Chris? @!CHRIS-CUOMO-@1-ABC# @(Off-camera) All right. You ca n't have any better picture of the morning than this. Look how beautiful everybody looks. Look at this. And I, of course, am next to the big man 's chair. Ila @(PH), who sits in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claus is gon na be sitting in here.
