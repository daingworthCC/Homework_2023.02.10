248741 @!JACKI-LYDEN-HOST : Home detention has become a popular alternative to prison terms for many convicted of nonviolent offenses. Stepping in to fill the demand are private companies. However, critics point to a recent investigation in the state of Maryland which highlights the need for national standards. Susan Goodman prepared this report. JOHN KENT, HEAD, HOME CONFINEMENT SERVICES : All right, William, you got your documents from last week? WILLIAM JENKINS, HOME INMATE : Yes, sir. SUSAN GOODMAN, REPORTER : John Kent runs Home Confinement Services, a private electronic monitoring business in Rockville, Maryland. He meets every other week with client William Jenkins, who 's serving time for drug possession in a home detention program @!JENKINS The only time I was out of the house last week was for work @!KENT Right. Take me back to the 17th @!JENKINS The 17th @!GOODMAN Jenkins must undergo regular testing for drugs, and wear an electronic ankle bracelet that tracks his coming and going from home. He also has to show proof that he was at his job @!KENT OK, Wednesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With chronic overcrowding in prisons and jails, courts in Maryland and across the country are turning to alternatives like this. Nationwide more than 22,000 people are in electronic monitoring programs. No one is sure how many, but a growing number are supervised by private companies. One reason governments like to use private companies is they can avoid paying for expensive medical care for people who are incarcerated. And improved technology and good marketing by equipment manufacturers has persuaded many entrepreneurs that they can make money in the electronic monitoring business. Jerry Roehmer( ph), a retired probation officer who owns a home monitoring business in Maryland, says that no one even knows how many private firms there are in the state. JERRY ROEHMER, OWNER, HOME MONITORING BUSINESS : No, if I had to take a guess, I would have to say somewhere between seven and 10 in the state of Maryland right now. Maybe two or three blossomed last night while I was asleep. There 's a whole mom and pop industry that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody sees a need and somebody comes in to fill that void, and saying, hey, I can do that @!GOODMAN One reason it 's so easy to get into the business is because Maryland does n't require a license or minimum standards, which is part of the problem, according to critics. They point to recent allegations by the state 's attorney that an employee of a private firm accepted drugs from a client in return for suspending his supervision. This triggered a grand jury investigation, which found insufficient in this case, but after taking a broader look at the industry, found an urgent need for regulation. Another troubling issue is that offenders are allowed to choose which company they use. That means they have an incentive to shop around for the firm with the lowest price and the most lenient reputation. Mark Mower( ph), who heads the Sentencing Project, says this sort of business competition may not be good for the public interest. MARK MOWER, HEAD, THE SENTENCING PROJECT : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a private vendor to minimize the amount of supervision that you do. If you just do the most basic supervision, you 're saving labor costs by not doing anything more intensive @!GOODMAN And, Mower says, it also may not be in the interest of a business to report violations because if an offender goes back to jail, the firm loses a client @!MOWER It does n't mean that most companies to engage in this. But a more unscrupulous company, or one that 's feeling a little pinched for their bottom line, certainly can be tempted to cut corners @!GOODMAN Compounding the problem is that when jails are full, people charged with serious crimes may end up in monitoring programs, sometimes with tragic results. A convicted felon in Maryland was referred to a private monitoring program while awaiting trial for armed robbery. While under supervision, police say he committed three rapes and two robberies. But Roehmer says it 's the courts that are ultimately responsible for keeping dangerous people out of monitoring programs @!ROEHMER If you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes, I could turn a person down who is violent. Would I turn him down? I guess that would depend on each individual case, and I 'd have to look at each one. But by my turning him down, that does not put him back in jail or put him back into the court system. That simply means he walks out my door and goes to find another program @!GOODMAN Linda Connolly( ph), who 's been working with the American Corrections Association and others on developing industry standards, says electronic monitoring can be a good tool, but only if it 's part of a comprehensive program that includes counseling and personal supervision. LINDA CONNOLLY, DEVELOPER OF INDUSTRY STANDARDS FOR ELECTRONIC MONITORING : A person has to document everything the client does outside of the home. The equipment only documents what goes on inside the home, when the person comes home and leaves home. So somebody needs to pay attention to what 's going on the rest of the hours, when they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a bare bones program, she says. And wearing an electronic ankle bracelet will never offer the same level of public safety as a jail cell. Even so, she says, that 's better than what happens now, when offenders are released from overcrowded jails without any supervision at all. For National Public Radio, I 'm Susan Goodman. #
