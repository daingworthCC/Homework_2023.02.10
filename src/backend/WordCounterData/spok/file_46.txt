228041 @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) @!MICHAEL-SHOELS-FA : You know, everybody 's talking about monetorials. Man, this is not about money. This is about change. @!GEOFFREY-FIEGER-P : We 're talking about two high school students constructing 50 bombs over a period of time, moving them into a school, having gun barrels in plain view on their dressers at the point at which the police entered the Harris 's home. That is inconceivable to me, as just -- forget about being a lawyer -- as a rational person, that these parents were n't derelict in a legal responsibility with regard to the supervision of their children, having nothing to do with whether or not they 're good people or not. They were negligent, and this suit is about negligence. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!BOBBIE-BATTISTA-H : Can parents be held responsible for the actions of their children? An attorney for the parents of one Columbine victim says yes. @!BATTISTA : The parents of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold are being sued for negligence over the killings at Columbine High School. The suit was filed by the parents of Isaiah Shoels, one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. With us in Littleton, Colorado, now, is Jack Beam, a local attorney for the Shoels family. @!Mr-Beam-thanks-fo# @!JACK-BEAM-SHOELS- : Thank you. @!BATTISTA : When you say that the family is suing for negligence, in what context? What are the Shoels asserting? @!BEAM : Parents have a responsibility to take care of their children. They have a responsibility under law to protect other people from their children when they know or should know of their child 's propensity for harm. And, of course, in this case they did. @!BATTISTA : And the fact that Isaiah was black and some are saying that he was singled out by the shooters because he is black, is that part of the lawsuit? @!BEAM : It 's a part of the profile of these killers, which is that they were predisposed to hate. And certainly he was the one person there that was specifically singled out that we know of. There may have been others singled out for other reasons, but certainly he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!BATTISTA : At the core of this lawsuit, you will have to prove that the parents knew about the boys ' plans for this massacre. How difficult is that going to be? @!BEAM : Well, we know at least from today and from past reports, that they were making bombs, that they were sawing off shotguns, that they were amassing a stockpile of automatic weapons. @!BATTISTA : But at the same time they were making bombs -- they were making them on the Internet. OK, from the way I understand it, the sawed-off shotgun was found on Eric 's dresser the day of the shootings, that he -- and the speculation was that he had left it there because he knew he was n't coming back. So what I 'm saying is it is as easy as it sounds or are you making it too simplistic? @!BEAM : Well, you know, the case has just started, and we have n't even begun to investigate all of the facts that are going to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and as the poor father of Rachel Scott said yesterday in the United States Congress, this is something that had been in planning for a year. This is not a situation, please keep in mind, where a child simply goes crazy, starts shooting people. These were convicted criminals. So in that sense, I say that the Klebold and Harrises had an advantage that the parents in Paducah and Jonesboro did n't have. They had prior warning. They had notice. And yet they 're still allowed to drive around in their BMW, they 're still allowed to associate with each other, they 're still allowed to build bombs and possess automatic weapons. @!BATTISTA : Now, when you say they were convicted criminals, both of these boys had been arrested and -- for breaking into a car, as I understand it, had completed a juvenile justice program of some sort and got glowing reviews from the counselor or the probation officer or whatever you call him in that situation. Is that not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I think these were sophisticated young men, and I think these were also sophisticated parents that should have been in touch with them. Keep in mind what the judge said who did pass sentence. He said you guys are either really lousy criminals and should get a new vocation or I know just intuitively that you 've done this before. And I find the thing really striking here is that they come from a city of opportunity. These are kids who did n't need to break into a car. There 's a more insidious nature to that, I daresay, than when a kid in perhaps a less privileged neighborhood breaks into a car. I view it as much more serious when kids who have everything -- and these kids had everything, from BMW 's, obviously, to automatic weapons. They had everything, and they break into a car? That 's insidious. @!BATTISTA : Joining us also now from Littleton is Marc Kaplan, president of the Colorado Trial Lawyers Association. @!Mr-Kaplan-you-hav# @!MARC-KAPLAN-COLOR : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because really all they 've done is sued for negligence. And if the facts bear out that the parents did n't act reasonably, then there 's nothing wrong with a lawsuit for negligence. My problem really is with the, sort of, the grandstanding. This $250 million claim for damages. I think that most people find that offensive and not borne by the facts. @!BEAM : Well I 'm offended by -- if I can just say here, Bobbie -- because I 'm a parent,... @!BATTISTA : Sure. @!BEAM :... I 'm offended by that, because I think that when you say to the parents and to the children of this state that you 're only worth $250,000, I think that 's obscene. And you know, we 're a fairly conservative state, where we have a lot of people, including our governor -- our governor, who, by the way, is cutting property tax and implicitly cutting aid to schools. You know Colorado ranks 36th in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to do with this case? It has a lot to do with this case, because it shows the mentality of our legislature, which is in a headlock by the insurance lobby. And I say that with some experience, unlike my good friend Marc -- and I have a lot of respect for Marc, he 's a very fine lawyer -- unlike my friend Marc, my partner and I practice in some 20 or 30 states. We have a little different perspective. And other than " Dan Quaylesville, " Indiana, where they do n't put a value on life -- at least not after delivery -- other than Dan Quaylesville, Indiana, Colorado has one of the most repressive, oppressive, obscene laws. Two hundred fifty thousand dollars for the value of a child 's life? I say to you that children -- or parents of children watching in Atlanta or L.A. or Detroit or South Side of Chicago, I do n't know your child. Your child is worth more than $250,000. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geoffrey made that clear. @!BATTISTA : I was going to say, is this about money, Mr. Kaplan? @!KAPLAN : Well, I certainly hope not, because, like I said, I do n't think $250 million is a realistic amount. If it 's about a cause, if it 's about finding out who is responsible and making sure that those people are held responsible under the law, then let 's focus in on what the lawsuit is and what the facts are, and let 's not talk about money in any sense. You know, Colorado has a law that says you ca n't put the amount of amount of money in your lawsuit, and Jack followed that. I do n't know why we do n't all follow that with regard to press releases as well. @!BATTISTA : Let me go to the audience quickly. Brenda, you had a comment earlier. @!BRENDA : Yes. I was just concerned. I understand the parents are grieving, but I think their cause would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of group to work towards less violence in the schools, rather than just a lawsuit for money. @!BEAM : Well, Brenda, if I could respond it that, we need to get to the facts here. Keep in mind that one of the targets, potential targets -- and it may not be borne out -- one of the potential targets is the Jefferson County Sheriff 's Department, and they are, right now, the ones who are filtering the evidence to the press. You ask a reporter in this town if you can get a straight answer about this duplicate key story. Ask if you can get the story on autopsies. Were there kids that were killed from, quote, " friendly fire, " because we had 90 rounds emptied into that building within approximately 15 minutes by members of law enforcement before they were treated and then, of course, took another three hours to gain access to the building. So there 's a lot of issues, Brenda, that we really need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things I would like to respond to right now is that, because of the legislature, because they 're headlocked by the insurance industry, we were compelled to get our case going within less than six months because we have to file a notice against the state or any entity that we might sue within 180 days. And finally, it 's important -- let me just mention about this money issue. No one seems to know the law in this state. I am happy to say that with the help of a very talented partner, Doug Raymond, I researched the law, and, in fact, this is a very political issue, because ultimately this case, if it were to be a governmental immunity case, is decided not by the courts. It 's decided by the legislature, and most people do n't know that. @!BATTISTA : Are you talking about parental responsibility laws in the state of Colorado? @!BEAM : I 'm talking about, now, about the governmental immunity issue, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clarifying that, Bobbie. @!BATTISTA : OK... @!KAPLAN : Bobbie, I was going to say, if I could just jump in for a second. You know, the problem with having a group of parents get together or having a state commission, which one media person recommended, is that they do n't have the subpoena power. They do n't have the ability to get documents produced the way a lawyer can get that under our system. And weeks ago the school district announced that they were spending a million dollars and their lawyers were already working on their defense. So the wagons have been circled. In defense of what Jack is trying to do, I think it 's going to take a civil lawsuit to find out what really happened and who 's responsible. It would be nice if parents could get together and get that information, but in this society people wo n't talk if they 're afraid of losing some money. @!BATTISTA : Maybe in this particular case. You know, we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment. @!JEFFREY : Yes, I just do n't understand, if this was planned for nearly a year, how these parents did n't have an idea on what was going on. And also, I also believe that the parents should be held accountable in some way because it might set a precedent, that if the parents need to be more responsible for what -- their kids ' actions and what they are doing. @!BATTISTA : Let me ask you something : Have you ever hidden anything from your parents? @!JEFFREY : I have but not to this extent, and I -- if I were making something or constructing this in my garage, my parents would definitely be on me. @!BATTISTA : But the point being that if you wanted to hide something from them, you could, right? @!JEFFREY : It depends on what it was, I mean... @!BATTISTA : OK, up here to Jim quickly, and then I 've got to take a phone call. @!JIM : Yes, my question would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, how come you do n't sue the person who sold the guns to give to the children in the hardware store, who sold the pipes and everything else to the people? @!BEAM : Well, I think it 's... @!BATTISTA : We -- yes, let me -- I 've got to go to break first and we 'll talk about that because, as Geoffrey Fieger said, who 's spearheading this lawsuit, this is the tip of the iceberg. So we 'll talk about what sort of slope they 're going down, and I will get to Susie on the phone right after the break. Parents of school shooters in Jonesboro, Arkansas ; Paducah, Kentucky ; and Moses Lake, Washington all face lawsuits from families of the victims. The lawsuits allege the parents should have done more to control their children. @(COMMERCIAL-BREAK) @!BATTISTA : And welcome back. Jim wanted to address the fact that, Mr. Beam, Geoffrey Fieger had said this is the tip of the iceberg, that, actually going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a series of lawsuits against the school district, the gun manufacturers, anyone who may turn out to be an accomplice or aided and abetted in anyway. Where does it stop? @!BEAM : Well, it -- not so much where it stopped, where it starts, you know? We have to have a good-faith basis. We had a good-faith basis for the parents, proceeding against them, and also, philosophically, we think that, if we 're going to turn things around in this country, it 's got to start in the home. And interestingly enough, we 're aligned there with the likes of William Bennett on the conservative side, folks like Jesse Jackson on the other side who are talking about family. And if you 're going to bring parent -- children into this world, you 're going to be parents -- is it easy to be a parent? No. Can you be perfect? No. But when you know that your children have committed serious crimes and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other -- and what ever happened to the word " grounded "? I mean, I knew that word as a kid. We need to empower parents, and perhaps this will give them a incentive by watching this case to say : " You know, Billy, Suzie, you know, you 're going to be in tonight at 11:00 not 1:00. " That would n't be so bad in this country, I do n't think. @!BATTISTA : OK, let me -- let 's take a phone call from Susan in Florida. Susan, you say that you have a troubled teenager. @!SUSAN : My daughter had a problem starting at the age of 13, and as far as grounding the child in this state or any other state, if you do anything to your child that they can constitute as imprisonment, the Social Services, Child And Family Welfare will get after you and you will be garbage, you will be the one thrown in jail. @!BATTISTA : I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does. Have you ever put your child in a bedroom, said " You are grounded. Now you stay in your room, " then she goes out the window. What are you supposed to do, sit in the room with your child every single moment of the day? It does n't happen. That 's not the real world. Suing these parents is only a knee-jerk reaction to get more money for something that they 've already set up a fund for the victims of the families. Let them get their jollies out of taking that money. I am appalled... @!BEAM : Well, you know... @!SUSAN :... that they take the parents to task on this. Every parent of every child who has ever tried to put their children into the system and has had the system fail on them to the point where these people actually lost their children -- no, what I 'm -- what I 'm talking about : My daughter was in the system, and I 'm lucky that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. But it was n't because the system itself was the problem, it 's the fact that the parents and the system have to work together. And when the system tells you that your child is doing fine, then that means : OK, I can take a breath. But when you take that breath, you 're then going to be sued. That 's baloney. @!BATTISTA : That 's true. Susan, thanks @!BEAM : Well, the system did n't tell these people... @!BATTISTA : But -- yes, but wait a minute, they did. These probation officers told the parents and everyone else that these were fine young boys, they seemed have gotten over this little incident that they had breaking into the car. I mean, if someone told you that as a parent -- at that point, do you not have to trust -- maybe, trust your child ; keep an eye, but trust your child again? @!BEAM : I think you look at your child with a different eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you have that obligation. And there 's going to be people out there in this country who believe in that bumper sticker that always offends me, that " you- know-what " happens. But I believe that things happen for a reason. These people had notice, as we learned today. They were making pipe bombs in the home. Now, I do n't know that this lady that 's so irate has a daughter that 's making pipe bombs, but if she was, I think she should be stopped. And to go into your daughter 's room and ground her and spend a couple hours in your daughter 's room is a good thing to do. Get to know your kids. Get to know what they 're doing. Can you know everything? No. But pipe bombs? Yes. Automatic weapons? Yes. We 're not talking about some little childish prank here. We 've become so insensitive to violence in this country, we just -- " Oh, well, let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't think so. I 've been -- spent some time with Ivanda Shoels. That woman is still bleeding. And until you put a child in a casket and close that casket lid and walked in their shoes, I think you should be a little less critical, at least until -- at least until all the facts come in. Let 's not be afraid to get to the facts. Please, if we 're afraid to get to the facts in this country, we 're done as a civilization. @!BATTISTA : Brenda wants to respond to that here in the audience. @!BRENDA : Yes, I do, because I have put my daughter in a casket, and no amount of money would help solve this problem. @!BEAM : But perhaps it 's a deterrent to the next parent, you know? When I... @!BRENDA : No, they 'd be better served to start an organization, such as MADD and organize and work towards better parental responsibility, without simply going after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we should do is eliminate lawyers and lawsuits altogether. @(APPLAUSE) Let 's go back to what they did in the Old Testament, an eye for an eye. Is that what you prefer? You know, I used to defend a helmet company -- a football helmet company. They got sued for $6 million. Everybody screamed : Lawsuits, those terrible lawyers. You know what I noticed? Twenty- five 25 years later, when my son went out on a football field, I noticed that that helmet was different than the one the company I used to represent manufactured. It was safer. It was much more secure, because some lawyer, some terrible lawyer, filed a lawsuit and got money for a quadriplegic. Now, every kid goes on a football field, and can they still get hurt? Yes, but their risk is reduced because some lawyer wanted to get to the facts. @!KAPLAN : You know, I think what we need to do is look at personal responsibility and personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want anybody to be accountable or they want everybody to be accountable, and I ca n't tell which. But what we have under the negligence laws is that if you were negligent, if you failed to act reasonably, then you should bear that responsibility. That 's what lawsuits are for. And as Jack said, If the facts bear out that these parents did act reasonably, as I guess this one woman did, then they do n't have any liability or any exposure under the law. @!BATTISTA : We have to take a break. We 'll continue in just a second. An Oklahoma law makes parent perform community service or pay a fine of up to $2,000 if they 're child has a firearm at school. Florida requires parents to pay the cost of their child 's criminal prosecution. And in Tennessee, parents must pay the cost of medical exams, treatment and pretrial placement of their children. @(END-VIDEOTAPE) @!JOHANNA : Johanna from American University. Although it seems unlikely that the parents did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not right to hold them accountable for what the kids did. @!BATTISTA : Let me ask you both quickly a legal question. This ruling the other day by the Supreme Court that schools can be held liable for allowing sexual harassment to go on under their watch -- does this help your case any? @!BEAM : It is certainly something we 're going to explore and we 're going to evaluate it. It sheds new light on the whole legal context of our future investigation. @!KAPLAN : You know, I think it makes a big difference because the school district and the government in Colorado has immunity for negligent acts, so if the school district or the sheriff 's department or some other government person or entity did n't do what we think is right or reasonable, you ca n't sue them under state law. And so this federal law may play a part in it, I agree. @!BATTISTA : Alex in our audience has a question about the laws. @!ALEX : I wonder why you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward changing the laws to make parents criminally responsible for the responsibility, so we have an open discussion about the balance of kid 's rights, parent 's rights and their legal responsibilities. @!BEAM : Well, that 's a good point. There is, of course, a criminal investigation right now, and the Harris family has hired a very capable, well-respected defense attorney in town, and as have the Klebolds. And so the Harris 's have already taken Fifth Amendment. @!KAPLAN : I think it 's important, just like you said, that we look as a society, we look at the whole question of what are parents responsible for? Should they be criminally? Should they be civilly responsible? Right now, there may not be responsibility at all. And I think as a society, we have to decide who is bearing the responsibility and what type of responsibility it is. @!BATTISA : On the phone with us now is Dr. Paul Houston, executive director of the American Association of School Administrators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, that often happens -- schools are often on the receiving end of litigation of this nature. It 's fairly common, unfortunately, and it 'll end up draining more resources away, even if the schools are found not to be liable, just to defend themselves is a problem, and that seems to be the direction our society is headed ; so it 's too bad, but that 's probably the way it 'll go. @!BATTISTA : At the same time, how do you deal with the fact that it would appear a number of warning signs -- I grant you, in retrospect -- were ignored or -- by teachers and school officials on these two? @!HOUSTON : Well, I suppose that that 'll be sorted out, but obviously, the problem is, as you said, it appears it 's always easier after the fact to Monday morning quarterback a situation to say, well, they should have seen this or they should have seen that. Typically, the standard is fairly high for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of did they have a reasonable -- was it reasonable that they would have seen something and then ignored it in spite of what they saw? You know, the fact is that we see warning signs everyday with thousands of children who do n't do anything, and you 've got the problem now of schools acting with the same warning signs and people raising issues that were violating the rights of students by trying to act on the warning signs. So it 's a tricky situation for schools. They 're caught in a dilemma on this thing. @!BATTISTA : And it 's hard, I think, for, I would guess, for teachers. I mean, I know the two boys made a videotape that enacted out this whole thing, kind of a foreshadowing of what was to come. But, you know, it 's up to the teachers ' judgment, I guess, as to whether or not to look at this as some kind of warning sign? @!HOUSTON : Well, it is, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those kinds of tapes made every year in schools, where the students obviously do n't follow-up, because unfortunately, our kids are growing up in a society where a lot of the imagery they see reflects that kind of activity. And... @!BEAM : I 'm sorry, Bobbie, but I 'd like to ask a question of Mr. Houston. @!BATTISTA : Yes, go ahead. @!BEAM : As between the parents and the schools, how do you feel about parents taking more responsibility than what you, as a person connect with school administration have seen over the past 10, 20 years in this country. @!HOUSTON : Well, that 's a great question because I think that clearly it would be pretty easy for me as a school person to say that the parents should take more responsibility. I think that -- I 've been thinking a lot about this lately, and it seems to me that it 's increasingly difficult for parents. I mean, my parents had the advantage -- they did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or what kind of video games I was playing because they did n't exist when I was growing up, and parents today are caught in a limbo, on one hand, of the economy, where many of them are having both parents are working if there are two at home, and so that they do n't have the time to give to parenting. They need to, And on the other hand, the complexity of parenting is much more difficult. I 'd like to see us spend more energy within schools and with our society saying how do we affirm and support parents in a role that I think is becoming increasingly complex. And I think it 's a very, very difficult role to be a parent in today 's society, given what the kids are exposed to. @!BATTISTA : All right, Mr. Houston. Thanks very much for your insight. Our thanks also to Jack Beam and Marc Kaplan for joining us today. Coming up in just a moment, forget what 's legal. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing do. We 'll be back in a second. @(BEGIN-VIDEO-CLIP) I 'm not a hunter, I do not even own a gun. I 'm not here to represent or defend the NRA because I do n't believe they 're responsible for my daughter 's death. @(END-VIDEO-CLIP) @!BATTISTA : Testifying before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime yesterday, Darrell Scott, who 's daughter was killed in the Columbine shooting, said his daughter 's murder should be blamed on the shooters and not the guns. @(COMMERCIAL-BREAK) @!CAROLYN : This is Carolyn at American University, and I think the Shoels are obviously looking for a way to get rich from their tragedy. @!BATTISTA : Welcome back. With us now here in Atlanta is Ian Punnett, a radio talk show host on WGST. His show is also syndicated on WSC in Charleston, South Carolina ; and Armstrong Williams, chief executive officer of the Graham-Williams Group, a public relations firm. He 's also a columnist and hosts a nationally syndicated radio talk show called " The Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called, " Beyond Blame : Moving Beyond Being a Victim. " Welcome to both of you. And I 'll just go ahead and ask you the core question here, whether parents should be held accountable for the sins of their children -- Ian. @!IAN-PUNNETT-RADIO : Well, I 'm interested in what Armstrong has to say in this, too, because I 've been following him for a long time. But I just say, as a viewer of the last 20 minutes or so, I 'm taken with how I think the audience is so much further along on the wisdom curve than the attorneys that we were watching. And I understand that they have legal issues which they have a right to pursue, that the families have a right, a legal right in this country, to pursue, but there 's a difference between legal technicalities and moral generalities, and they 're getting them confused. And the part that 's bothering me the most about that is that they say something will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will put an end to this. And then right after that, there 's a graphic on the screen that says there 's been lawsuits after single one of these shootings. Well it obviously did n't stop the next one. So that 's proof positive that it wo n't stop bad parents from being bad parents. @!BATTISTA : So, Armstrong, are these lawsuits and ensuing laws a deterrent? ARMSTRONG @!WILLIAMS, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST : Well, you know, this one for me is very difficult. I 've agonized over this. Obviously, parents must be held accountable for the actions of their children. When their children do well, they 're credited for it. You know, even though most people never meet my parents, I 'm a reflection of my parents. No matter what I do, I can never escape that. However, you know, what is happening in this society today which we can not ignore is that so many parents who spend little time communicating with their children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only teaching them that but setting the example for them, teaching them about faith in God, work ethic, discipline and routine and talk about limits on how you express or act out your anger. What they do not in these neighborhoods is they substitute money and things for values. they think things can buy these kids happiness, so these kids go through life lifeless and in that a( UNINTELLIGIBLE) find no where to turn and they 're crying out, because they lack love and they lack understanding. They go out and commit these bloody terrorist acts like what happened at Columbine High School. I think it 's harsh for someone to say at American University that the Shoels are suing to get rich off of the child 's tragedy. I do n't think it is that. I think these parents are so agonized, they lost the child. This is a shock to them. They 're devastated. They 're probably blaming themselves, and they 're trying to heal and show that their child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vain. So they 're searching for someone to do. And I 'm sure that lawyers -- and I think contribute to what is wrong with this country, and it does n't take anybody -- a lawyer will take on any lawsuit, whether it 's winnable or not. And so I want to say that the parents are trying to express their grief through suing these parents, to say, it 's because of you that my child is dead. I think they have every right to it, and I know it wo n't stop them. But at least it will send a message and maybe a very small message, that it 's for them, it 's for their own healing. It has nothing to do with the larger of the society. @!PUNNETT : Well, -- and I agree 100 percent. I mean, I think all of our hearts go out to the parents of this child and all of the parents of all of the victims. The grief impulse to try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can all understand, but as so many other people have pointed out, is it up to lawyers to be the arbiters of this? Are we going to let lawyers decide in judicial proceedings what 's going to be proof of what can be -- how the blame can be associated? It 'll never be that. The reason why the parents had to get lawyers, the reason why they did n't cooperate with the sheriff 's department is the specter of a lawsuit. And so afterwards -- and the other attorneys, they justified their actions by saying, hey, without attorneys we wo n't get down to the bottom of it. Well, we would n't have to have attorneys to get down to the bottom of it if the families were n't able to cooperate. But they ca n't because of lawsuits? @!WILLIAMS : Well, if you 're going to -- if you 're going to be... @!BATTISTA : Let me -- let me -- You know what? Let me take -- this caller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me take her quickly. Patricia, who lives in Maryland, go ahead. @!PATRICIA : Yes. Unfortunately, when you 're dealing with the schools, you do need to have attorneys. I 'm a stay-at-home mother, have been raising biological, adopted and special-needs children. I have been fighting the schools to get my children educated and safe from bullies for 32 years. These parents, I give them credit. They are making a stand and holding everyone accountable, which we need. @!WILLIAMS : And I 'd like to comment and follow-up on what she said. I think she 's absolutely right. And also, another factor in this debate that is sometimes left out, is that parents -- I mean we live in a society today -- when I was growing up as a child on that tobacco farm in Marion, South Carolina, my father -- what -- the way my father and mother disciplined us would be considered child abuse today. Well, let me tell you, it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have your but disciplined and whipped in that classroom when you got out of hand. The government wo n't even allow parents to discipline their children today because they 'll blame it on the schools... @!PUNNETT : And let 's -- let 's take that -- let 's take that to its... @!WILLIAMS :... So the parents are in a very precarious situation. @!PUNNETT : Let 's take that to the next level, though, Armstrong. If you 're going to say -- and I respect what you 're saying and I 'm not ashamed to give a swat to my boys. I have two lovely little boys, and I think it 's one of the ways, you know, that just in the littlest sense sometimes... @!BATTISTA : It worked for me... @!PUNNETT : Well, yes. And yes... @!WILLIAMS : It 's still working for me. @!PUNNETT : What do we do then if we know, as most sociologists will say and as many parents recognize, that there 's a point sometime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' behavior and peer groups end up taking over. So who do we sue then? The parents of the other kids because they did n't raise their kids right? Is that who we go after? Then its a class-action lawsuit and it 's dozens of people every time something happens -- and that 's going to solve something. @!WILLIAMS : That 's not the issue. The issue is this : When we were growing up -- and I 'm sure many people in the audience can identify this -- my mother and father knew who we dated, they knew who our friends were, who their parents were, what their backgrounds were -- they were more involved in our lives than our friends... @!PUNNETT : Now, Armstrong, if you and I are both going to be honest, there are things that both your mother and my mother do n't know what we did when we were 15 years old. Is that not right, Armstrong? Does she know absolutely everything? I do n't think so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this. @!WILLIAMS : What they did know kept me out of trouble. @!BATTISTA : I have to go to a break. @!PUNNETT : Right, and there but for the grace of God go all of us, Armstrong. Thank God nothing that we did wrong came back to hurt us. I mean, but if it had, if something -- that that one time that we had taken the keys out of the drawer that our parents had put in there to keep away from us, if we had taken a drive, if we 'd taken a drink, if there had been something that happened that was tragic, you 'd be sitting there going, well, bad parents. And it could be just that one time. So, I mean, who would you sue then? @!BATTISTA : I got go to a break. @(COMMERCIAL-BREAK) @!BATTISTA : And welcome back. You know, some people might wonder, Ian and Armstrong, if you practically might have to take out an insurance policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawsuits over parental responsibility. A lot of people are bringing up the question, where does it stop? I mean, do you start suing the entertainment industry and parents if they let their kids watch the wrong thing, and something grows out of that? @!PUNNETT : If we have the right lawsuit, it would include hundreds of defendants, but how do you adjudicate that? I mean, if you take the average influence in all of us, and the media certainly can not turn around and say, well, we get to comment on how well all other people are doing on this. It 's like a lawyer who is getting a third of the settlement trying to tell me about morality. I do n't know that that 's all his vested interest, is trying to, you know, settle new moral decisions -- not at a third of what 's a $250 million lawsuit. And yet, I also think it 's also important to note that what other people have said keeps going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Armstrong said, I 'm the byproduct of my parents. Well, we all are? So, why are we setting an arbitrary date of 18? If you get convicted of a crime at 20, why ca n't your parents be responsible? Why ca n't you sue your parents? If 25? If Armstrong today is the person because his parents made him be that way -- why ca n't he say that about somebody who does wrong, that at 35 his parents are still responsible. @!WILLIAMS : Let me comment. Most parents -- I would say 80 percent of the parents in this country do a marvelous job in raising their children. But this situation in Columbine was a little different -- that they planned this mass murder for over a year ; they had all this ammunition, the bomb materials, the guns in the house ; neighbors heard explosions in the garage -- I 've got to tell you, I find it very difficult for me, and most people, to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially after the teachers in that school, after their kids had written an essay on an assignment that was given to them, and they talked about the violence and what they wanted to do at Columbine, and the teacher became so concerned that they sent the essays to the parents. Now, I got to tell you, in a situation like this, I do n't think most people would have reacted the way these parents did. It seems as though they sat around and did absolutely nothing. @!BATTISTA : Well, wait. Eric Harris was on psychiatric medication, his parents obviously trying to do something, They were aware that Eric had obviously some sort of problem and were trying to address it in that way. From the accounts from the neighbors that knew these people, they were great parents. They went to all their kids activities and supported them. They thought -- Dylan 's parents thought he was heading off to college in the fall. @!PUNNETT : And let 's not -- I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, to get so passionate about this that we forget the real pain of this is what the family of Isaiah Shoels and what all the other victims are going through, and that we have to -- we can never forget, in all of our sound and fury over nothing, that we can never forget that tomorrow they 've got to wake up without their child. They have to go through their day, so do the parents of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. And we have to understand that a lot of what they 're going to do, I think we have to allow them to do, and we have to say, look, you 're parents in grief you 're parents in grief and this is a natural impulse, and we have to start support them in that. The difference is when we allow it to start setting a precedent for how everybody should be reacting toward everything. @!BATTISTA : OK, hold that thought. We have to go to break again. We 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!BATTISTA : Just discussing this amongst our audience here. Armstrong, you want to make one last quick point. Go ahead. @!WILLIAMS : Bobbie, I wanted to go back to something you said about the parents were aware that their son had problems. One of the problems in society today, and it is indicated by what happened with the guidance counselors 's report about both these kids, saying they were great kids, they would be great contributors to society -- we live in a society now where we ca n't tell these kids the truth. We can not tell them when they failed a course, we can not tell them with when they 're doing bad in the classroom, because we live in a society now where we must make them feel good. Everybody -- we 're in this feel-good thing, where everybody has to feel good, and no one faces the truth that really measures who they are, where they are academically, where they are socially. And when we do that, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have, and in the end it brings about ultimate destruction. @!BATTISTA : Armstrong, thank you so much. Ian Punnett, thank you. Enjoy your holiday, folks, and join us again on Monday. @!TO-ORDER-A-VIDEO-O#
