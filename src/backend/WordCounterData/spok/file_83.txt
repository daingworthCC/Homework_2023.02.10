234341 ANNOUNCER : From ABC News, This Week with David Brinkley. Now, from Washington, David Brinkley. DAVID BRINKLEY, ABC News : Ready or not, another presidential election has begun. Now. The President is raising money and hoping to project an image of such strength that no other Democrat will want to run against him. His television commercials are already made and will be on the air beginning next Tuesday, 16 months before the election, with the most money going to California, a state he must win. A Democratic consultant says this is unprecedented, and no incumbent president has ever thought of running commercials this early. The Republicans, having control of Congress, now want the White House and all the power, perks and privileges that go with it - smaller government, lower taxes and much else - so, beginning shortly from both parties, the promises will fall from their lips like autumn leaves on a maple tree. voice-over Our guest today will carry much of the campaign burden for the Democratic Party - Vice President Al Gore. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Cokie Roberts, here on our This Week program. on camera First, a little news. Warren Burger, former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, died last night. voice-over He was 87. He was only the 16th Chief Justice in American history. He was appointed by President Nixon and served through 1986. on camera Timothy McVeigh, suspected of the Oklahoma City bombing and now held in jail, gave Newsweek Magazine his first interview. He says he did n't do it, and says the first he knew of the bombing was when a highway patrolman stopped him from driving without a license plate. He was horrified, he said, by the images of children killed and maimed in the explosion. Now for our topic for today, we are going to switch now to Jim Wooten, who has been wading through the rising tide of presidential politics and tells us what he 's found. Jim? JIM WOOTEN, ABC News : David, as you well know, it 's awfully difficult, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this town, to draw a bright and shining line between today 's public servant and tomorrow 's candidate for re-election, and maybe it 's a line that does n't have to be drawn, anyway. After all, good policy is supposed to make for good politics, is n't it? The problem is that, for better or worse, it 's going to get harder and harder to tell the difference now that the ' 96 campaign is upon us, and not a moment too soon. It 's only 499 days - you can look it up - until the next election. Sen. PHIL GRAMM,( R), Texas, Presidential Candidate : I today declare myself a candidate- LAMAR ALEXANDER, Republican Presidential Candidate : -for the office of the presidency of the United States of America Sen. ROBERT DOLE,( R), Kansas, Majority Leader/Presidential Candidate : I am not afraid to lead, and I know the way. JIM WOOTEN : voice-over The Republicans, with White House dreams, have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democrats - President Clinton and Vice President Gore - are on their first campaign swing, a cross-country fundraising tour touting their policies, to be sure, but testing their politics as well. Pres. BILL CLINTON : June 22, 1995 We ask you for your labors, we ask you for your passion, we ask you for your heart. We are going to have to fight and debate and struggle to make sure that, in this season, we make the right decisions. JIM WOOTEN : voice-over One decision seems clear already. As in 1992 when Al Gore was a principal campaign asset, ' 96 will feature him as well. He holds a large and significant administration portfolio, including the environment and reinventing government, and on Tuesday leaves for Moscow to press Clinton 's policies there. Pres. BILL CLINTON : I believe with all my heart that Al Gore will go down in American history as the most influential and productive vice president in our country 's history. JIM WOOTEN : voice-over And Gore himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poke fun at his less-than-electric image. ALBERT GORE, U.S. Vice President : Al Gore is so boring, his Secret Service code name is Al Gore. JIM WOOTEN : voice-over Both the President and the Vice President face the same problem next year - a Democratic Party badly split between influential liberals like Jesse Jackson - zealously loyal to the traditions of FDR and LBJ - and those more moderate, so-called ' New Democrats ' like Al From, who say that approach is not only passe, but poison for the party. AL FROM, Democratic Leadership Council ; The old Democratic coalition based on interest-group politics and based on the interests that grew out of the New Deal and the New Society- that old coalition is gone, it 's dead. It 's Humpty-Dumpty - it 'll never be put back together again. JIM WOOTEN : voice-over From thinks the President 's new budget-balancing proposals have finally liberated him from the party 's congressional claws and put him on the right course for next year 's campaign. AL FROM : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found that the entrenchment of the infrastructure of the party in the interest groups was just enormous. And I think he finally decided that if he is going to lead the country where he wants to lead it, he has got to make that break, and he did it. JIM WOOTEN : voice-over And he did it - re-identified himself as the ' New Democrat ' who won three years ago - he did it with the enthusiastic encouragement and support of his vice president. The question, of course, for Mr. Gore and the President is whether that gets them re-elected and, if so, will that victory come at the expense of their party? David? DAVID BRINKLEY : Jim Wooten, thank you. Coming next, our one and only guest today, the Vice President, Al Gore, in a moment. Commercial break DAVID BRINKLEY : Here with us now is the Vice President of the United States, Al Gore, and along with all of us here, George Will, Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, you 've already started to campaign. Why so early? ALBERT GORE, U.S. Vice President : Well, we do n't feel like we 've started the campaign- DAVID BRINKLEY : Well, you 're going to be running commercials on the air next week. Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : -but we 're defending the ban on assault weapons and the 100,000 extra police officers on the streets of America 's cities because the new Republican Congress and their leadership has served notice that they 're going to try to repeal the ban on assault weapons, because the National Rifle Association wants them to do that and to repeal other important parts of the law to fight against crime. And we 're not going to stand by and let them do that. They 've just now done the- the bidding of the anti-choice coalition that has such influence in their party - by defeating Dr. Foster. Now we have this new battle coming up, and we 're just not going to sit on the sidelines. DAVID BRINKLEY : So you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not for another several months, right? Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : Well, we 've been to a lot of states. We 've been- I 've been to, I think, 45 of the 50 states in the last year or so, and- you know, in modern campaigns, it is inevitable that some of the groundwork is laid pretty early, but we are not shifting gears to go into the ' campaign mode, ' so to speak. That 's wo n't come for quite some time. Some fundraising and some laying of the groundwork has been under way and will continue, but not the full campaign thrust by any means. DAVID BRINKLEY : Okay. GEORGE WILL, ABC News : Mr. Vice President, Jesse Jackson is increasingly scathing in his references to the President. He calls him ' Republican lite, ' and all the rest. He threatens quite openly to put, as he says, ' another line on the ballot. ' Have you talked to Jesse Jackson about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his threat to run as a third party candidate? Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : Well, I have talked to him frequently. I have not in the last two or three weeks, and I have n't discussed this particular- these last series of statements. I would say this, though, that we have worked very hard on measures like the expansion of the earned income tax credit that raises the incomes of low-middle income working families. We 've worked on drug and crime prevention. We 've worked on the empowerment zone strategy to give special attention to impoverished inner-city areas and distressed rural areas, and we have- we 've made a great deal of progress in lowering the unemployment rate. African-American unemployment is below double digits for the first time in 25 years, so- GEORGE WILL : But now- now you 're administration is in the process of coming up with its policy on affirmative action after the Supreme Court opinion. The President said the Supreme Court opinion was consistent with his views. The Supreme Court opinion seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest, are okay if they 're simply to remedy identifiable past discrimination. The President, however, said he also thinks there should be affirmative action to make a more inclusive society, to promote diversity and all the rest. Where are you going to come out on this and when? Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : Well, a majority of the Court, if you read the concurring opinions - and I 'm sure you have, George- I know that you agreed very strongly with Justice Scalia 's opinion- but a majority of the justices seemed very clearly to say that the promotion of diversity in our society is a legitimate goal, and certainly it is. No one can read American history without feeling very deeply that we have got to continue moving forward toward a more diverse society. GEORGE WILL : Is that your- is it- it is your reading of the Court opinion that they said affirmative action, racial set-asides and all the rest can survive strict scrutiny if they are simply to promote diversity and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALBERT GORE : Well, the particular opinion, the Adarand opinion, leaves a lot of questions unanswered, and I believe you 've written as much. They- they clearly say that any affirmative action program has to meet the same kind of test that was earlier established for state programs in the Croson decision. But, you know, a lot of the cities and states have, since that earlier decision, gone back and designed programs that meet that test and have moved forward. And what the federal government will now do is the same thing. Can- can I just take a moment, though, to- to talk about this broader question? Because it 's very important for our country. I personally believe that the whole affirmative action debate ought to be separated into two basic subdivisions - the national interest in promoting diversity and making sure that we never go back to Selma or Central High School, and that we all- that we continue moving forward. And then, the second half of the issue involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertake to reach the national interests are fair and do not visit injustice upon individuals who are affected by them, so that we can build up and sustain a supply of grace, if you will, that will see us through on this historic journey toward a more just society and a more diverse society. SAM DONALDSON, ABC News : Mr. Vice President, Al From, the president of the Democratic Leadership Conference, says that the President must run against his own party 's base. Now, how does the leader of the Democratic Party run against the Democratic Party 's base? Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : Well, we 're not. We- we have put forward a vision of America 's future that- SAM DONALDSON : You do n't agree with From, then. Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : I do n't agree with everything that Al From says or writes, no. SAM DONALDSON : But in this particular case? Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : Well, we 're not running against people, we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America 's future that President Clinton outlined in 1992 and has fought for for the last 2.5 years. And that means investing in our future with education and job training, protecting the environment, bringing our nation together, and promoting fiscal responsibility. SAM DONALDSON : All right- Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : We 've reduced the budget deficit three years in a row and we 're moving toward a balanced budget, but we 're doing it in a humane way. There 's a right way and a wrong way- SAM DONALDSON : And let me ask you about another- Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : We stand for the right way. SAM DONALDSON : -another piece of advice. Dick Morris, who is the President 's new political guru, we understand- some have called him a Svengali. He 's a political consultant who 's worked for people like Senator Trent Lott, among others, as well as Mr. Clinton in the early days, suggests that he has to position himself, the President, in a manner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's somewhere between the Democratic leftists and the Republican right-wing, but I want to hear it from you. What is triangulation and how does the President do that? Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : Well, it sounds to me like you 're following this stuff more closely than I am, Sam. It's- SAM DONALDSON : Oh, you think it 's a bunch of nonsense? Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : Well, there 's nothing particularly new about the relationship between this consultant and President Clinton. They go back to 1977. He was the first consultant that President Clinton ever had, and so there is nothing new or unusual about it. Nor is there anything new or unusual about Bill Clinton saying that the Democratic Party has to be a centrist party that promotes fiscal responsibility while investing in America 's future. That's- that 's what we went all over this nation, saying in 1992, and that 's what we have spent our time attempting to accomplish in the last 2.5 years. SAM DONALDSON : Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you have to shoot all the left-wing Democrats on Capitol Hill, who for months have been doing the line that they 're against Medicare cuts because that 's transferring money from the poor and the elderly to the rich, and then have the President undercut them with a new budget that seems to say, ' Me, too '? Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : Well, we 're not shooting anybody, and a majority of Democrats on Capitol Hill, I believe, support the President 's course. Those who have disagreed have been vocal about it, but every single Democratic governor unanimously endorsed the President 's new budget and his plan just two days ago in a letter and in a conference call- SAM DONALDSON : Mr. Bonior did n't, Mr. Gephardt did n't, and they 're your leaders in the House. Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : Well- SAM DONALDSON : Mr. Dashiell did n't. He 's your leader in the Senate. Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : Well, some have reservations about some portions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some on one side, some on the other side - but the President 's attempting to steer a responsible course that can bring our country together. That 's what he 's supposed to do, as President. DAVID BRINKLEY : Cokie? COKIE ROBERTS, ABC News : Let me- let me just try to finish up on this at this point, before we go, which is- Jesse Jackson says he might be breaking away to the left. You 've got a Democrat- another Democrat on the Hill defecting to the Republican Party this week, and others threatening to, or talking about it. It does n't seem to be working, does it? If you 're losing Democrats on the right and losing Democrats on the left, is your strategy working? Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : Working for the country, because we 've transformed this- COKIE ROBERTS : Is it working for your re-election? Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : Well, that remains to be seen, but it 's working for the country for sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states have had 2.5 years of uninterrupted, sustained economic growth - the first time that 's happened in a long time - inflation is at a 30-year low- COKIE ROBERTS : But- Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : -6.7 million new jobs. Unemployment is down 20 percent. We 're opening up new markets in Europe, Asia, Japan- COKIE ROBERTS : But wages are also down, with productivity up. Is that working for American workers- Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : That 's part- COKIE ROBERTS : -and does that become a problem for you is you seem to move away from those people? Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : That is part of the problem that we came to solve. That is a symptom of the- of the big structural change that 's going on in our economy and in the world economy, and the answer to that problem is to invest in education and job training and the nation 's infrastructure to equip or people, our workforce and our country to make this historic transition. That 's why we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the environment while eliminating the budget deficit. The Republicans, by contrast, are slashing education, slashing Medicare beneficiaries. We do n't cut any Medicare beneficiaries at all - they do. Their approach would take our country back, back to the days of the triple-dip recession that we inherited. DAVID BRINKLEY : Cokie, I need to interrupt here for a moment. We 'll be back with more questions for the Vice President in a moment. Commercial break DAVID BRINKLEY : Cokie, I interrupted you. You go ahead. COKIE ROBERTS : Mr. Vice President, I 'd like to tick off a few things that are before the Congress right now. One, base closings - will the President veto the recommendations of the Base Closing Commission? Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : It 's premature to reach that decision, because the final results of this round are not in yet. We 're very concerned that the Defense Department 's proposal was changed to radically, and we 're very concerned that the end result may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to reserve judgment because- COKIE ROBERTS : But that sounds like a ' maybe. ' Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : Well, we do n't know yet. We do n't know yet. Every- you know, the President is given a very limited option under this law that was written quite a number of years ago, and it- it- it really limits what he can do. But we 're going to look at it very carefully when the results are all in. COKIE ROBERTS : And the Senate has passed a bill that says that- that there would be censorship, essentially, of the online network. Would the President support that if it came to him, if the House passed it? Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : We prefer an industry-based approach. I agree with the concerns that Senator Exon is expressing. I think that it 's a- COKIE ROBERTS : So he probably would n't sign it? Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : Well, let 's wait and see what the final result is. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We did not support the specific language as written. The Justice Department pointed out that it would make it very difficult for them to enforce the current laws on- on pornography. We think it 's a very serious problem, it must be solved. We hope the conference committee will- will come up with modifications that will handle it. SAM DONALDSON : Let me ask you about another point- Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : And the industry is working very hard to come up with an industry-based response. SAM DONALDSON : On Tuesday, they 'll vote on Capitol Hill on a constitutional amendment to prevent the desecration or burning of the American flag. You oppose that amendment. Why? Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : Oh, I- I voted on that when I was a member of the United States Senate, and I listened to the debate. I started out leaning in favor of the amendment, and then I listened to the debate, and I heard some of the- the war heroes in the Congress say, ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that local communities really need, ' because in most communities around our country, if somebody tries to burn a flag, the community itself is going to pretty well take care of that. And why change the- the First Amendment, which has served us so well and has never been changed in more than 200 years? So that's- SAM DONALDSON : Well, apart from the arguments, which may be very realistic on your part, politically, is n't it very dangerous opposed an amendment against burning the American flag? Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : Oh, I guess it is. I guess it is, but I think most people, regardless of party, who sit down and listen to what 's at stake and listen to the debate come away thinking, ' Oh, come on, that 's just- that 's a hyped up issue that ' - SAM DONALDSON : Another program that- vaccines for children program. I see in the morning paper the GAO says it 's mismanaged. Senator Dale Bumpers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zero. It 's one of the Clintons ' favorite programs. Do you think it should be scrapped? Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : No, I do n't. I- we 're certainly willing to sit down and look at changes that may need to be made in the program. I 'll remind you that when we came in, more than 50 percent of American children were not getting their vaccinations, and that 's the problem we 've been trying to solve. And is n't troubling to see the United States way, way down the list of countries around the world in terms of vaccinating children against diseases? That 's something that cries out for a response. If we can improve the way we 're going to about it, we 're certainly willing to do it, and being in charge of the President 's reinventing government effort, I can tell you we 're very interested in eliminating any problems in government programs, and we 've been making a lot of progress in that regard. Sixteen thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abolition of 321 programs. We 've eliminated 150,000 positions in the federal government. We 're making a lot of progress. DAVID BRINKLEY : Some of your toughest critics are within the Democratic Party, for example, one you 've already mentioned, Al From of the Democratic Leadership Council, who was heard to say or write the other day that the Democrats are a party with no clear government philosophy, teetering on the edge of irrelevance. Would you like to deliver a little response to that? Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : Fellows, you can- DAVID BRINKLEY : I know you 'll deny it, but beyond that, what? Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : I 'll reject it vigorously and I 'll also point out- DAVID BRINKLEY : Why did he say that? Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : -that he wrote that- I think Al tries to be an advocate to move the party in the direction he wants to see it go, and he wrote that particular article some time before the President 's speech two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech, ' Finally, at long last, ' the President 's moving in the direction he wants. Well, the President 's always been moving in that direction and moving the country in that direction. And the Democratic Party, having always been a so-called ' big tent, ' with a lot of views expressed in it, has always had these tensions. There 's nothing knew about this. Franklin Roosevelt experienced it, Harry Truman experienced it. And President Clinton has done more to bring the country together on a course that 's promoting economic prosperity and peace than anybody in a long, long time. GEORGE WILL : At Halifax, the President was in the extraordinary position of saying to our allies he 'd like to help with the force going in- the British and French, by and large, force going into Bosnia, but he ca n't get the money out of a Republican-controlled Congress. Will the administration find a substantial sum of money - maybe not the $300 million - without going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Congress now on exactly how to proceed on that. We are not going to commit ground forces to Bosnia. We are going to- GEORGE WILL : Except for an extraction of the U.N. forces- we 're committed to that. Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : That- sure. If our NATO allies get into an emergency situation and decide to withdraw, of course we 'll come to their aid. I do n't think there 's much disagreement on- on that. But- but bear this in mind. We have continued the longest humanitarian airlift in history - it 's still going on. We 've taken the casualties - ' we ' being NATO and the UNPROFOR force there - from 140,000 in 1992 to less than 3,000 last year. We 've continued to impose very harsh sanctions on Belgrade, which have been partly responsible for the leader there, Milosevic, coming around to try to put pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to settle this. We 've taken a- GEORGE WILL : But- Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned into two sides, with the Croats and the Bosnian government now in a federation, and the so-called contact group is still making some progress toward a negotiated settlement. Now, finally, the entire conflict has been contained. It has not spread to Macedonia or Kosovo or even to Croatia, much less to Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, Turkey. GEORGE WILL : Does- does the administration think the U.N. forces will be there through another winter? Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : We do n't know. We do n't know. The staying power- GEORGE WILL : But you 've thought about it. Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : Well, the staying power of the French and the British and the Dutch and the others has been pretty impressive. GEORGE WILL : I 'm talking about the U.N. forces. Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : Yes, I understand. They're- they 're the ones that make up the- the U.N. forces along with units from several other countries. COKIE ROBERTS : Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this that the U.N. should not be in the business of peacemaking, that a peacekeeping force should really go in only after the diplomats have come to an agreement and then they go in and keep the peace? Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : Well, there are a lot of lessons from this whole episode, but I would not draw the- the wrong lesson. You know, Mark Twain said, in his famous saying, that a cat burned on a hot stove wo n't sit on a hot stove again, but wo n't sit on a cold one, either. Here on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, let 's also remember that, in places like Cambodia and Namibia and El Salvador, the United Nations has been responsible for transforming civil wars into peaceful democracies. COKIE ROBERTS : But those were after a peace settlement was agreed to. Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : But- but they also involved the limited use of U.N. forces to try to separate the sides and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would move toward peace. Now, the situation in Bosnia has been going on for a long time. We inherited this conflict. We have made some progress with it without involving U.S. ground forces there. GEORGE WILL : Does the United States have an interest - describe it as vital, if you wish - but an interest in preventing massacres of a genocidal scale which, some people think, would occur if, indeed when the U.N. forces leave before winter? Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : Yes. I think that is an interest of the United States. Helping to prevent the spread of the conflict in Bosnia is also an interest, and I- I agree with the premise of your question, namely, that if the UNPROFOR forces suddenly pulled out, there would be an interval before the heavy weapons were delivered to the Bosnian government and before they were trained in- in their use, during which the Serb forces would attempt to surge and overrun Sarajevo and the eastern enclaves of Gorazde, Srebrenica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just horrific. And, yes, the world county has an interest in- in trying to prevent that. SAM DONALDSON : Two- two quick questions, if I may. The Republicans on Capitol Hill have now agreed on their budget resolution. If the committees should write and the Congress should pass appropriation bills that contain the size of the Medicare cuts contained in that Republican resolution, and the size of the tax increases- or rather, cuts contained, would the President veto it? Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : Well, Sam, the President 's made clear that tax cuts for the- aimed largely at the wealthy and the Medicare cuts to beneficiaries of this size are just plain wrong. And it 's interesting- if- if the Republicans eliminated the tax cuts for the wealthy in this time of huge deficits and just accepted the President 's limited tax cut to middle income families for education expenses- if they just made that one change, they could completely eliminate all of their proposed cuts to Medicare beneficiaries. They 're attempting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealthy. SAM DONALDSON : Well, do I take it that the answer is the President would consider vetoing? Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : Of course. Of course. SAM DONALDSON : All right. Second question- Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : But- but- but let me say one other thing. One of the reasons the President went the extra mile and introduced his new budget plan is to try to bring our country together and avoid- SAM DONALDSON : All right, let me- Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : -this huge collision at the end of the fiscal year. DAVID BRINKLEY : You 've got 30 seconds, Sam. SAM DONALDSON : He 's about to choke us both off, so let me ask you the second one. Are we going to make a trade deal with the Japanese, or on Wednesday will we see 100-percent tariff on many Japanese autos? Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : Well, if we do n't get an agreement by Tuesday night, then the sanctions will be imposed on- SAM DONALDSON : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROBERTS : Will we get an agreement? SAM DONALDSON : -who 's now in Geneva. What does the administration have- do you have a new offer to put on the table? Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : Well, we- we hope that they will- that the Japanese will be reasonable and- and come to an agreement, but if they do not- SAM DONALDSON : Do you have a new offer, Mr. Vice President? Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : -then these sanctions will be imposed. DAVID BRINKLEY : You have no- you have no idea now how it 's going, how will it turn out? Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : No, I do n't. Mr. Kantor and Mr. Hashimoto will be meeting each other tomorrow, and they 'll work through until the deadline- DAVID BRINKLEY : All right- Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : We- we just do n't know. We 're not- SAM DONALDSON : Is that good for- DAVID BRINKLEY : Sam, we 've got to go. Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : We 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAVID BRINKLEY : Mr. Vice President, thank you very much for coming. Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : Thank you. DAVID BRINKLEY : Pleasure to have you, and good luck to you. Vice Pres. ALBERT GORE : Thank you. DAVID BRINKLEY : We 'll be back with our own perhaps rambling discussion of what 's going on in the news in a moment. Commercial break DAVID BRINKLEY : Warren Burger died last night. I 'm not sure whether he was the 16th or the 17th Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. SAM DONALDSON : Sixteenth, I think. DAVID BRINKLEY : Sixteenth, was it? I thought maybe there were 16 before- anyway, 16. He was appointed by Nixon, and he was a- generally speaking a conservative. Any thoughts about him by anyone? GEORGE WILL : I think he was not a bit conservative. Really, the- it 's arguable that, since 1954, the school desegregation decision, the Supreme Court has been the most important shaping institution in American society. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George, in social issues. GEORGE WILL : Well, I think it 's unfortunate. I think it 's debilitating to democracy, and it embitters lots of debates when it- these are settled by judicial fiat, but not one significant Earl Warren Court decision was overturned by the Warren Burger Court. Indeed, it is, I think, arguable and probably true that the most radical Supreme Court decision was- taken since 1954 was Roe v. Wade by the Burger Court, which overturned, of course, 50 states ' abortion laws. SAM DONALDSON : But, you see, that 's it, George. When you say he was not a bit conservative. He was conservative, but he was insufficiently conservative and did n't have enough troops, may I say, on the Court, And the Warren Court, then, was perpetuated to the extent that the Burger Court did continue a moderate course, It 's only recently that we have swerved far to the right. I think Warren Burger will not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he will certainly go down as one who was responsible and whose Court was responsible to American life. DAVID BRINKLEY : What do you think, Cokie? COKIE ROBERTS : Well, I think that- that people- there 'd be a lot of argument about whether he was a conservative, whether the Court was moderate. I think it moved certainly to conservative direction under Warren Burger 's Chief Justice-hood, but that is what the Court should be doing. The Court should move as sort of lagging indicator on American politics, and that is what it tends to do. and when it gets to a point where it 's too far out from the American popular view, it shifts, and it shifts partly because of presidential changes, but partly because it understands just what George was saying, which is that you have- to have the body politic support an institution that is not elected and not responsive to the people, it has to be very, very careful not to get too far away from what people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : As its critics charge, has it often been - George, you have paid more attention to this - a legislative body writing laws? GEORGE WILL : Well, I- I think when the history of the Burger Court finally is written, it may say that it produced out of a privacy right discovered in an emanation of a penumbra of other rights abortion on demand, and the Burger Court gave us, really, busing, with all the divisive effects that we 're still living with on that, and did much to advance affirmative action and race-conscious remedies, to use the term. If they say that 's a conservative Supreme Court, then we- we 're going to have to go back and dust off our categories. DAVID BRINKLEY : All right, well, we may do that, but we do n't have time to do it all today, George. Dr. Foster lost in the Senate. Were you surprised, Cokie? COKIE ROBERTS : No, in the end it was not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't lose in an up-or-down vote. The- the- the debate over Dr. Foster had left him in the dust a long time ago and moved on to a debate between Bob Dole, Phil Gramm and Bill Clinton- DAVID BRINKLEY : So it was- COKIE ROBERTS : -and it was a- DAVID BRINKLEY : -a political circus. It was a political circus. COKIE ROBERTS : It was a political decision, but most decisions are political decisions. I do n't think that that 's some evil, horrible thing. The- and I do n't think anybody really lost in this one. The President played to his base- DAVID BRINKLEY : Well, evil or horrible? COKIE ROBERTS : -the Republicans played to their base, and- and the person who lost was Henry Foster. SAM DONALDSON : Well, excuse me, but- Henry Foster lost. COKIE ROBERTS : Yes, Henry Foster lost. I just said that. SAM DONALDSON : I mean, someone did lose, and I would suggest that people who think that, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merit. SAM DONALDSON : Well, perhaps not on merit, because we never got to a vote. DAVID BRINKLEY : We 'll never know about it. SAM DONALDSON : And I was about to say,( a), people who think that you ought to have a vote up or down- Bob Dole used to think this when Judge Manion was up there. He argued strongly, for a conservative Republican, that there ought to be an up-and-down vote. And the Democrats have tried over the years occasionally to filibuster, but never have been successful. Cokie, I 'm interested in a new technique up there. When I covered the Senate in the ' 60s and the ' 70s, if there was a filibuster, people talked. COKIE ROBERTS : Well, this is a very good point. SAM DONALDSON : Now, I was there when Strom Thurmond talked for 24 hours- COKIE ROBERTS : I was. It was a very- SAM DONALDSON : Now, he talked in 1954. You weren't- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't there then, were you? COKIE ROBERTS : Yes. It was- SAM DONALDSON : How does it look- DAVID BRINKLEY : I was. SAM DONALDSON : He said he 'd stopped his filibuster- Strom Thurmond said he 'd stopped his 24-hour filibuster because he needed to control his bodily fluids. Is that right? COKIE ROBERTS : He did. He did. I do n't want to discuss that- that part, but I did- I was in the gallery for a good bit of that filibuster, but the fact is is that- SAM DONALDSON : Well, now they just say, ' Okay, we 're going to have a filibuster and we 're going to have a cloture. ' COKIE ROBERTS : That 's the problem, and I have a- my view- I am a great supporter of filibusters, I am a great supporter of the- the protections of minorities on both sides, but- but it should n't be abused, and the people who abuse it are the leaders. The leaders should say to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it 's the opposition party, say, ' Look, fine, filibuster, go for it, be my guest, ' and then I think you would see far fewer filibusters if people had to stand on the floor of the Senate and deal with the kinds of things Strom Thurmond had to deal with. SAM DONALDSON : Of course, Estes Kefauver dropped dead because he was filibustering. COKIE ROBERTS : Well, that was a problem, but, you know, that might be a lesson to them, like the Vice President said about the cat on the stove- might- might keep some of them from doing it. GEORGE WILL : Well, what happened to Dr. Foster was an additional fallout of Roe v. Wade, of the Burger Court. I mean, there 's just a sort of seamless echo here. SAM DONALDSON : Boy, you never let up, do you? You get something in your teeth, and you just wo n't let go. GEORGE WILL : Well, you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President nominating someone whose views- fine, he agrees with the President on abortion, but thus far millions- SAM DONALDSON : Whose views are anathema to you. GEORGE WILL : No, no, no, no, no. There are millions of Americans who abhor abortion, who are deeply offended by it, and it is unfriendly of the President- SAM DONALDSON : And maybe even more who think it 's an accepted part of our lives. GEORGE WILL : I understand that, but do you have to- sort of that in-your-face kind of nomination on the part of the President, deeply offensive to these people? It was not necessary. COKIE ROBERTS : It was not necessary- SAM DONALDSON : Was n't it- COKIE ROBERTS : -and I do n't think it was intended. SAM DONALDSON : Were n't we- COKIE ROBERTS : I think that it was- that they did n't think about it when they named him. They thought he was a lovely man who had worked against teen pregnancy. DAVID BRINKLEY : All right- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one in the Democratic Party at all anymore who is right-to-life, and therefore the Clintons- COKIE ROBERTS : Bob Casey. GEORGE WILL : Yeah, exactly. The Clintons do n't know anyone who's- SAM DONALDSON : Am I delighted with the opportunity to take a- say a kind word about President Clinton, and I will on this. GEORGE WILL : You 'll make his day. SAM DONALDSON : No, it- well, I do n't know about that. DAVID BRINKLEY : This is a moment in history. SAM DONALDSON : At least on this one, the President stood up for something. He nominated someone who stood for something. It was a botched nomination, perhaps - I take a little bit back - but it was at least a nominee who had something to say and who stood for something. You 're suggesting, I guess, that we should nominate nerds. COKIE ROBERTS : No. Look the surgeon general- GEORGE WILL : Find someone who 's not into abortions. COKIE ROBERTS : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system. GEORGE WILL : Yes. COKIE ROBERTS : There is- what is wrong with finding a doctor in the public health service who can then- SAM DONALDSON : Well, abortion is one of the- the major problems in public health today- COKIE ROBERTS : It is? SAM DONALDSON : Well, yes, in the sense that- COKIE ROBERTS : Why? SAM DONALDSON : -it 's an operation that is largely held in this country. People debate it, but it 's not something you sweep under the rug and say, ' Well, only three people are interested in this. ' DAVID BRINKLEY : When Foster was first mentioned, were n't we told or at least led to believe that he had performed some tiny number of abortion, always in emergency- SAM DONALDSON : Well, that 's why it was botched. They did n't come clean immediately, and I do n't know whether it was coming clean or they just did n't have their ducks in a row. DAVID BRINKLEY : Well, I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COKIE ROBERTS : I think they just did n't think about it one way or the other. DAVID BRINKLEY : -and at first, it seemed he had done almost no abortions - a few, a handful, something. SAM DONALDSON : So they botched the nomination. DAVID BRINKLEY : All right, well, let 's go on. We 'll be back with more of this in a moment. Commercial break DAVID BRINKLEY : Fifty years ago tomorrow in the opera house in San Francisco, 150 - approximately - countries sent their emissaries to sign the United Nations charter and to bring it into being. And interesting little sidelight I 've just come across : some of those who were there to sign spent a little time ahead of time practicing their signatures so they would have them looking nice for history and for their grandchildren. Anyway, the U.N. is still with us and is it good or bad? George, what? GEORGE WILL : Well, it 's useful primarily when it is congruent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the Gulf War when Bush very skillfully made it serve collective security - but as a kind of autonomous actor producing collective security in a kind of Wilsonian world of international law, the world is n't ready for that and, I think, never will be. DAVID BRINKLEY : Cokie, what do you think? COKIE ROBERTS : Well, I think- I- I basically agree with that. I think that it has- it was thwarted for so long in its ability, thought, to- to do what the great powers wanted because there was such a fight between the- the Soviet Union- Soviet bloc and the western powers that the U.N. was always in a state of- of gridlock. And then, after that, I think we got to a point where we thought it could do more than it apparently can, and Bosnia being the best example. But it is important to keep in mind, I think, what the Vice President said. There are places all over the world where peacekeeping forces have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and years, and kept war from happening again. SAM DONALDSON : It is- it- DAVID BRINKLEY : Go ahead, Sam. SAM DONALDSON : It is useful as a town hall meeting. It is useful as a peacekeeping force in minor ways - in the Sinai in the early days. It has a whole list of successes, but they are n't the big successes. The Soviet Union was not destroyed by the U.N. War was not prevented in the Gulf by the U.N., but in fact, it served as an umbrella. I think the fear that- in this country, particularly on the right, has manifested itself all during the years of the U.N., 50 years, that somehow it would take over, be a super-world-body, and that we would be subordinated to it - clearly, after 50 years, ought to diminish. The U.N. is not going- Boutros Boutros-Ghali is not going to be president of the United States or of the world. We can use the organization, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay our dues. It 's shameful that the United States wo n't pay up. Why, we 're just- we 're the big debtors of the world. GEORGE WILL : This- this week in Bosnia, the Serbs shelled a city, killing people. NATO said, ' We want to bomb to punish the Bosnian Serbs for doing this, ' and the U.N. vetoed it. Now, that 's no way- COKIE ROBERTS : And that 's happened several times. GEORGE WILL : -for a great power to conduct its- its foreign policy. And if the U.N. keeps up doing this, we will not pay our dues, and we will not pay attention to the U.N. SAM DONALDSON : Well, the U.N. is not- COKIE ROBERTS : I- SAM DONALDSON : -does not have the power, George, apart from its member nations, to do anything. If- the proper resolution- COKIE ROBERTS : Well, the charter actually gives it the power, but we never filled it. SAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could n't veto a particular air strike, but we 're not going to do that air strike by air strike. COKIE ROBERTS : The- the other part of the United Nations that I think, though, is worth talking about is all of the other agencies that have been formed under its umbrella, and a lot of them- DAVID BRINKLEY : Vaccinating children. COKIE ROBERTS : Excuse me- that 's right, taking the- in health surveys around the world, and trying to find out what the state of the economies are and what needs what where. And some of those have been highly successful. Others have not, but some of them have been very, very successful agencies. DAVID BRINKLEY : Would you say its successes are quite great? It ca n't be expected to wipe out war. It never will. Nothing ever has. COKIE ROBERTS : Human nature is the same. DAVID BRINKLEY : Any- George, what? Sam? COKIE ROBERTS : You ca n't go in the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on another 50 years or longer. DAVID BRINKLEY : All right. Now, we have developed- are developing in this country a sort of electronic back fence, I think you might call it, where, properly equipped, almost anybody can talk to almost anybody in this country and, indeed, around the world, if you know the language, including some language that is maybe inappropriate for public use. So there 's some controversy about the computer online circulation of dirty language and raunchy stuff put on by some of its people. Censorship is being discussed in Congress. GEORGE WILL : Censorship is being passed in Congress. DAVID BRINKLEY : It passed the Senate. GEORGE WILL : That 's right. DAVID BRINKLEY : It passed the Senate. It has n't passed the house. COKIE ROBERTS : It 's not a back fence, though, David, because at a back fence, you can see the person you 're talking to, and even if the two of you are gossiping about somebody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a- a name attached to it that can be repeated. What's- what 's so insidious here is that is- DAVID BRINKLEY : Well, you choose the term. It 's not a back fence. What is it? What do you want to call it? COKIE ROBERTS : Well, but what 's insidious here is that it 's anonymous, and so that you can do all kinds of attacks on people, seduction of people- all kinds of information that 's misinformation, and there 's no accountability for it. SAM DONALDSON : Well, the Senate- the Senate bill sought to do something about the pornography on the Internet online services, and more than that on the ability of pedophiles to secure their prey on online. Newt Gingrich has opposed the bill. Now, I 'm a First Amendment advocate also, but we ought to be able to figure out some way where consenting adults, if they want to talk dirty, can talk dirty - I 'm not particularly for it, but you can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims, young children. If- if the United States ca n't protect against that, there 's something wrong with us. I think Speaker Gingrich ought to take a second look at this issue. DAVID BRINKLEY : Well, it 's certainly quite horrible, but do a lot of young children spend their time looking at online computer- SAM DONALDSON : Yes, they do. DAVID BRINKLEY : I 'm not talking about television programs. SAM DONALDSON : No, I 'm talking about online. Yes, they do. GEORGE WILL : Well, but, look- DAVID BRINKLEY : So? GEORGE WILL : -the basic thrust of this legislation is to get the government into making judgments it does n't make gracefully, that is, about what is obscenity and what is indecent and all the rest. It 's all very- we always wind up quoting Potter Stewart- COKIE ROBERTS : Right. GEORGE WILL : -the justice who says, ' I know it when I see it. ' Well, that 's all right, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think Newt Gingrich has a sort of basic libertarian point of view- COKIE ROBERTS : But you know what? GEORGE WILL : -that 's going to prevail here. I do not think the House will- SAM DONALDSON : Well, he does, and I agree with that, but- COKIE ROBERTS : But- but- I think that- SAM DONALDSON : -something. COKIE ROBERTS : I think he will prevail, but the truth is is that what everybody on Capitol Hill knows and what they are trying to deal with, both in this piece of legislation and the telecommunications legislation dealing with television and chips in your television set to keep watching things, is that parents in this country feel under assault. They feel like it 's hard enough to get up and go to work all day and get their kids to school and get them home, and then they 've got computers- they feel so good. They go, ' Look, my kid 's smart, he 's working on the computer. ' And then they discover- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROBERTS : -it 's full of smut and horror. And they- television, same thing, and the parents want somebody to give them a break, to give them a hand. And if Congress is n't going to find a way to do it- SAM DONALDSON : Well, picking up- COKIE ROBERTS : -they 're going to keep fighting for it. SAM DONALDSON : -on something you said about it being anonymous, there 's a judge on the West Coast - Oregon or Washington State, I 've forgotten which - who started the process by saying it is a publication. You see, if you say something that is slanderous, libelous in The Washington Post or on ABC News, suits will be held. And we ought to say to these people online, as this judge has, ' Folks, you ca n't just say any blank thing that comes into your head about someone. You are publishing to hundreds of thousands of people, and you 're going to be held accountable for it. ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem that you 're talking about. SAM DONALDSON : Well, it- it- well, no, it- but I 've shifted from the- from pornography to the idea that it 's a publication. I think an online service is a publication and ought to be under the rules of libel just as ABC News is. DAVID BRINKLEY : Well- COKIE ROBERTS : Well, then maybe it should have editors, too. SAM DONALDSON : Yes, it should. DAVID BRINKLEY : Well, only an individual can get the news, so- our time is up, anyway, so thanks, everybody. We 'll be back with a few words about Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, who says if you do n't answer his letters, he 'll put you in jail - in a moment. Commercial break DAVID BRINKLEY : Finally, there is no known citizen of the United States who does not have some kind of gripe about the federal government. Some gripes arriving in the mail now are caused by Senator Jesse Helms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law. It says if his committee writes to a federal agency with a question and does n't get an answer in 21 days, whoever should have answered and did n't will go to jail for two years. Jesse, the jails are already full. Think of something else. For all of us at ABC News until next week, thank you.
