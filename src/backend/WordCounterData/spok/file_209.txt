4122841 @!DAVID-MUIR# @(Off-camera) We 're gon na turn now to a major case still in the headlines tonight, a doctor accused of losing it. Authorities say he 's not the doctor patients fell in love with, not at home anyway. Is he suffering from his own sort of affliction, a kind of serial rage? Tonight, see the tapes for yourself. His family-friendly TV commercials and the tapes his wife recorded away from the office. Here 's my co-anchor Elizabeth Vargas. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) Losing it at 30,000 feet is n't pretty. Like these twin sisters settling a family dispute in the aisles of coach class. @!PASSENGER# @(Inaudible) @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) Or these dudes duking it out in the not-so-friendly skies earlier this year. But last winter, when Houstonians heard the news that a local doctor had allegedly used his surgically trained hands to choke a flight attendant, you might have to excuse them if they thought, " Oh no, not again. " You see, this is n't just any doctor. His name is Michael Brown. @!ROBERT-HANTMAN# Guys, no pictures. This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's had more appointments in courtrooms than operating rooms. @!WENDY-BURGOWER# I personally believe that he never sees himself as anything but a victim and that he feels anyone that disagrees with him must be punished, and he 's a very angry man. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) At one time, Michael Brown was one of America 's leading hand surgeons, an innovator in a treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome, with a taste for finer things. For the doctor, that meant a life of Texas excess and exes. He 'd already been through two wives by the time he met 20-year-old Darlina in 1993. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Off-camera) What was it about him that did captivate you? @!DARLINA-BARONE# He was very sweet, just very attentive to me, treated me like a princess in the beginning. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Off-camera) Did he buy you gifts? @!DARLINA-BARONE# Yeah, he absolutely spoiled me in the beginning. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) After two weeks, they were living together, married just about a year later, though it almost did n't happen except for Darlina 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and it was my fault, she decided on, on the wedding day. No. I do n't wan na get married, and I thought it was the jitters. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) To the outside world, Brown looked like a big-hearted healer. His TV commercials brought patients from around the nation to his Houston offices. He had fame. He had fortune. @!MICHAEL-BROWN# I personally train the doctors in the Brown procedure, and the Brown hand Center will care for you just as I care for my own family. @!SOPHIE# Daddy 's baby girl. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) But Darlina says she soon found out how Brown treated his actual family. @!DARLINA-BARONE# He used to be very, very sweet, very attentive to my needs, very, I mean, just abnormally sweet to me at all times. And then we get married, and things change. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Off-camera) It was on the honeymoon that you saw the first example of Mike and his temper? @!DARLINA-BARONE# We fought the entire time. We went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is gorgeous. However, we fought every single day. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) Back home, Darlina says her husband 's volcanic tempter often erupted when she would go out clubbing with her girlfriends, suspecting she was cheating, especially when he drank. Add to that volatile mix, the doctor 's beloved gun collection. Darlina was frightened. And after an early separation, she says things only got worse. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Off-camera) So what happened when you moved back in? @!DARLINA-BARONE# Oh, that 's when the abuse started. He slapped me, he pushed me, he grabbed my hair, hit my head up against the wall. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Off-camera) Why did you stay in that house? @!DARLINA-BARONE# He mentally brainwashed me. If I, if I told him that I was gon na leave, he 'd threaten me. @!LINDA-HUNNICUTT# He would talk down to her. She was n't good. She never did anything right. She could n't cook. I 've been over there when he 's, " Why did you fix this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to a person, you belittle them, and it 's mental abuse. @!DARLINA-BARONE# I did n't think anybody would believe me because he is the one that had all the money. He 's the one that had all the power. @!DOCTOR-JANET-TAYLO# They 're in love. They feel like they can change the person, and the abuser makes the woman feel like it 's her fault. And if you feel guilty and you feel vulnerable and you feel like it 's something you 've done, then there is this fear about leaving. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) By the year 2000, Darlina and Dr. Brown were still a couple with one baby and another on the way. Darlina figured that being pregnant, she 'd get a break from her husband 's scalding rage. She figured wrong. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Off-camera) So what happened toward the end of your pregnancy, the incident that finally blew the lid off? @!DARLINA-BARONE# I 'm watching a show on TV at about 10:00, and here he comes into the door. Mike comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't love him. And I go into the kitchen, and I grabbed the phone, like I always did, to call my mom. And he grabs the phone from me and starts beating me over the head with the phone. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) She claims he grabbed her by the hair, dragged her into the bedroom. @!DARLINA-BARONE# We had a four-poster bed. And as I saw the bed post on the floor and I 'm like, " Oh, no, this is gon na be bad. " And, I was so used to it, though. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Off-camera) Really? @!DARLINA-BARONE# Yeah. I was used to it, which is just crazy. But the next thing I know, I 'm on the ground, and he is sitting on my stomach, being seven months pregnant, telling me that I 'm effing not going to have that baby. He took the bed posts and was just beating me over the back with the bed post. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) She managed to escape, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Luckily, he missed. She was able to call 9-1-1. @!DARLINA-BARONE# I ca n't even open my right eye. I 'm bleeding. I 'm seven months pregnant. @!LINDA-HUNNICUTT# Her face was all swollen. Her mouth was huge and where he beat her on her head. They had the, the long bed posts that are on their bed, had this huge bed post mark, I 'm sorry, all the way down her back. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) Soon after, Dr. Brown was arrested. This is police video right after Dr. Brown was taken into custody. @!POLICE-OFFICER# He 's going nuts. We 're probably gon na have to restrain him further. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) Smashing his head against the squad car window. @!DARLINA-BARONE# @(Voiceover) The very last abuse he did on me made it totally public. It was in the news, and I was in the hospital for three days and, at that time, I felt that, you know what, everybody knows about it, this is my, this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assault, and Darlina filed for divorce. As the separate proceedings worked their way through the courts, evidence turned up, showing Dr. Brown 's alleged behavior going from the belligerent to the bizarre. @!MICHAEL-BROWN# we put a gun to our head to get attention, maybe a little bit. But we know it 's you. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) That 's Dr. Brown recorded on his own video camera in 2001. Why is he holding a gun to his own head? He claimed he was simply working on a Hollywood script. @!MICHAEL-BROWN# People that do commit suicide, they do n't do it to hurt people or because they wan na do it or because they 're cowards. They do it because they are being tortured in agony, and that 's, that 's the only way to stop the pain. @!DARLINA-BARONE# @(Voiceover) But Darlina does n't buy it. She says it 's evidence of a man on the edge. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Off-camera) So that scene we see on this videotape was actually what you were seeing on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Off-camera) This, the prominent Houston doctor was what, he was really doing behind closed doors? @!DARLINA-BARONE# Yes. Pretty scary. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) Dr. Brown claims he acted in self-defense the night he was arrested, but the jury does n't believe him. Darlina won a $3 million divorce settlement. @!DARLINA-BARONE# He ca n't hurt me this time ' cause everybody knows. @!BRIAN-WISE# if you had to describe Mike in one word, it would probably be misunderstood. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) Brown 's lawyer is Brian Weiss. @!BRIAN-WISE# It was his continuing bad choice in women, particularly a profile, if you will, of the same woman who have repeatedly show up in his life, somebody looking to get paid, somebody who viewed Mike as an atm. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) Though he turned down our request for an interview, Dr. Brown did speak in this deposition. @!MICHAEL-BROWN# Darlina lied on the witness stand. @!LAWYER# Uh-huh. @!MICHAEL-BROWN# Her mother lied on the witness stand. The day of the trial and the jury believed Darlina and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contest to aggravated assault charges in exchange for 10 years probation and set off to resume his life. But the doctor 's inner demons would not be silenced. There would soon be a new wife, new accusations, more sensational headlines and another judgment day in court. @!WENDY-BURGOWER# He went into a rage and grabbed her. @!NATHAN-HENNIGAN# He is a dangerous man, and I wanted him to be held accountable for what he did this time. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) Stay with us. @!MICHAEL-BROWN# Look at my face. See a man driven to insanity. @!MICHAEL-BROWN# Oh, you ride your horsy? @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) Dr. Michael Brown looks anything but the face of rage in this home video with his children, following his divorce from Darlina. @!MICHAEL-BROWN# Say, " Hi, Kevin. " @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) Maybe that 's why all the sensational publicity surrounding his aggravated assault case did n't ruin his practice. @!BRIAN-WISE# The caring father, the passionate CEO, somebody who has done so much good for so many people. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) Dr. Brown 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his personal controversy. After his 2001 divorce, Brown 's business thrives, several new offices open. He 's got a private plane, new homes and things were going great. That is until he was called before the Texas board of medicine. It seems the private plane was n't the only way the good doctor was getting high. He certainly seem to have a problem with cocaine, and that 's how he ultimately lost his license. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) Even though his license was revoked, Brown continued to live a charmed life. @!MICHAEL-BROWN# My baby got me a king throne chair. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) There was a new beautiful wife, Rachel, and a new family and more children. Dr. Brown polished his image, distributing these photos from a self-published book, showcasing swanky parties, social events with luminaries like President Bush. Brown even won a humanitarian award. But, once again, behind the scenes, the picture-perfect marriage was collapsing. @!DOCTOR-JANET-TAYLO# It sounds like he, there 's an aspect of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to, in spite of everything that he has to lose, express himself in whatever way he wants to. There 's something about the way his personality functions that he continues to just blame and react and hurt people, and he finds that acceptable. @!MICHAEL-BROWN# You 're out of your( censored by network) mind. They did not. It cost $50,000 since you called the( censored by network) police, Rachel. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) Rachel recorded these phone calls from Michael in late 2011. @!MICHAEL-BROWN# I am not the enemy, Rachel. @!RACHEL-BROWN# You attacked me, Michael. @!MICHAEL-BROWN# You( censored by network) attacked me. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) Rachel, who declined to do an interview with " 20/20, " wanted proof that Dr. Brown was out of control. @!MICHAEL-BROWN# Would you ask yourself that, you stupid( censored by network)?( Censored by network). @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) Those recordings became evidence after Rachel accused Brown of twisting her arm, as if he meant to break it. Prosecutors charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offender, and thought he was a dangerous man, and I wanted him to be held accountable for what he did this time. @!MELANIE-LAWSON# @(Off-camera) The trial of a prominent former hand surgeon is about to get underway. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) The case hits the local news, and Rachel takes the stand to tell her story. @!RACHEL-BROWN# Reach back, and when he threw it at me, I moved my head. @!JANE-WATERS# I 'm really proud of Rachel Brown. She stood up to him, she testified, and she told the jury what he did to her. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) But her testimony is n't convincing, and Dr. Brown 's lawyers call her a money-grubbing gold digger. @!DICK-DEGUERIN# It was all about money. that 's what happened in his previous divorce case. It was all about money. Any troubles that he 's had can be traced to that. @!GINA-GASTON# @(Off-camera) A jury has found a former surgeon not guilty of attacking his wife. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) In the end, the jury does n't believe Rachel, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Brown is, very well-known hand surgeon. But you ca n't judge a case on who he is, what he is, what he has, what, but I just feel like there was not enough concrete evidence to convict him. You ca n't worry about any prior cases. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) Triumphant in court, Brown 's lawyers cut off his electronic monitor for the cameras. @!DICK-DEGUERIN# The judge has authorized me to cut it off. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) And the doctor was free, once again, to go about his business. @!MICHAEL-BROWN# I 'm just relieved and, and wan na take care of my kids and get on with my life. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover) It seemed the doctor had vanquished all of his enemies, except, perhaps, himself. Fast forward to that flight from London this January. Dr. Brown allegedly wanted his dinner before the crew was ready. The crew claims that lead to a shouting match, which ended with Brown grabbing and finally choking flight attendants, resulting in his arrest. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown 's attorney claims his client does n't recall any of it due to stress relievers mixed with alcohol. As for Darlina, Dr. Brown 's brutalized ex-wife... @!DARLINA-BARONE# I ca n't open my right eye. I 'm bleeding. @!ELIZABETH-VARGAS# @(Voiceover)... she 'd like to forget about Dr. Brown 's behavior too. But her emotional wounds have yet to heal. @!DARLINA-BARONE# I do n't think he 's gon na change. And, you know, when you do n't take accountability for your actions, you ca n't change. He has never taken accountability for what he 's done to me. Next, is this what you 'd like to do after a bad day at the office? @!DAVE-HINER# As soon as we locked the door, the switch went off, and I just lost it. War in the workplace when we come back.
