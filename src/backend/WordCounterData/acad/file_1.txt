4000241 I think it is safe to say that ours is the only dining room in West Los Angeles on whose table -- an eight-foot-long, two-hundred-pound behemoth on which I have taken my meals for many years -- rest piles of photocopies of articles on suicide, all of which were printed in the Encyclopaedia Britannica over the past 220 years. They represent the convergence of two crucially important strands in my own life. Indeed, as I look at the articles, arrayed before me in fanlike tiers, I get the odd feeling that the old oak ruble on which I have eaten so many thousands of dinners has been set not with its customary china and silver but with my intellectual autobiography. <p> My special relationship with the Britannica is of long standing. It is relevant to report that I was a sickly child and stayed home from school a great deal. The reader can readily imagine the sort of boy I was : frail, bookish, and undersized( I was small to begin with, and continued to shrink, comparatively speaking, as I was double-promoted four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @). Our house, fifteen miles and seventy years from the one in which my wife and I live today, resembled those of many Eastern European Jewish immigrant families with intellectual aspirations. There were copies of Shakespeare, Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Conrad, and Mann, diligently assembled from the local Lincoln Heights Library 's list of " The 100 Best. " There was a windup Victrola and records of operatic arias sung by Caruso and Farrar. And in the center of all this -- the jewel in the Shneidman family 's cultural crown-there was the Ninth Edition of the Britannica, enshrined in a Stickley bookcase with glass doors and its own little key. The suite of Craftsman furniture to which the bookcase belonged also included a sofa, a chair, and a table. All of them are in my home today. <p> Among the happiest hours of my childhood were those spent alone at home, circa 1925. My parents would be working in their clothing store, my brother and sister would be in school, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, tucked in their 1910 Grand Rapids mahogany bed between two billowy white sheets, listening to Farrar sing Gilda and reading the encyclopedia. I have little doubt that more than half of what I know today I learned from the pages of the Ninth Edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. I suspect that this accounts for my essentially nineteenth-century ideas about science. And I muse that my frenetic and nervous way of studying( or reading or writing) -- a lifelong habit -- could well be a happy remnant of the fact that my first earnest perusals of " The Geometry " or " Kant " were interrupted every few minutes by the need to leap out of my parents ' bed either to change the 78-rpm record or to wind the Victrola. It seems unlikely that I would so deeply love the intellectual life today had I not initially found my young mind 's independence within such a cozy and easeful setting. <p> Fast-forward to 1949, the year that, quite by accident, I met my life 's second great strand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Brentwood Veterans Administration hospital. On that particular morning I was in the subbasement of the old Los Angeles Hall of Records, in the coroner 's vault, looking at file folders containing the records of certified deaths. The director of my hospital had asked me to prepare letters to two young widows whose husbands had recently committed suicide while they were hospital patients. My intention was to look at the two men 's folders, make some notes, and get back to work. <p> The first folder contained something I had not seen before : a genuine suicide note. The second folder did not. Who could stop at this point? I looked at several dozen folders. It seemed that every so often I would open a folder -- about one out of every fifteen suicide folders-and find a suicide note. I did a quick count of the folders on one shelf and estimated that I was standing in a room that contained approximately two thousand suicide notes. I felt like a cowpoke who, wandering home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oil and is just sober enough to realize he has found his fortune. <p> Had I indulged my initial urge to read the letters right there in the coroner 's vault, I might have learned a good deal about individual human tragedy, but I would have done nothing to advance the study of suicide, which was then an almost nonexistent field. Instead, in a decision that changed my life, I made photocopies of more than seven hundred genuine suicide notes and put them aside without reading them, so that my colleague Norman Farberow and I could later compare them, in blind controlled studies, with simulated suicide notes that would be elicited from nonsuicidal people. The result was the first work on suicide notes -- and indirectly on suicide itself -- that followed scientific protocols. My subsequent career -- helping to found the Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Center, developing a program in suicide prevention for the National Institute of Mental Health, thinking about suicide, writing about suicide -- all dates from that morning in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I have been continuously intrigued by the topic of suicide and drawn to people who are on the brink of serf-destruction. I am not a suicidal person myself ; my fascination is, I suppose, partly voyeuristic and partly scientific. I have always been attracted to excitement, and few things could be more exciting than the pursuit of understanding in a virgin field that involved such strong and intimate human emotions. <p> The reader can surmise what it meant to me, a quarter century after I happened upon those suicide notes, to be invited to contribute my own seven pages of printed text, headed " Suicide, " to volume 21 of the 1973 edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, the same set of books that once was my Testament, Koran, and Upanishads. <p> I have come close to implying that the Ninth Edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica was a kind of father figure to me. It is true that I treated those books and the information in them with a respect bordering on awe, that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cathedra. At that time, all these sentiments were also true of my unquestioned attitudes toward my father. Writing my own article for the EB was a psychological landmark ; it gave me a voice of my own. I suddenly felt like Ernest Pontifex, in The Way of All Flesh, who was finally able to contravene his father without feeling that he was either destroying or betraying him. <p> Before I wrote my 1973 article, I looked at two or three earlier pieces. It did not occur to me then to view them as documents of intellectual history ; I merely wished to identify my predecessors ' pitfalls -- such as an overreliance on dreary tables of statistics -- so I could avoid stepping into them myself. I wrote the article and proudly added the Fourteenth Edition of the Britannica to the Ninth Edition that still reposed in the glass-fronted Stickley bookcase that I had inherited. Two and a half decades passed. Then, as I approached the age of eighty, I had another thought. It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely to have in one 's twenties or even fifties, when the habit of looking back is not so fully developed. Why not examine the articles on suicide in all the editions since the first one, in 1768? <p> The idea allowed me simultaneously to become, all over again, the unformed child in a soft bed who had learned about the world from his parents ' encyclopedia, and also to read these articles on suicide -- including my own -- and see, from the emancipated vantage point of old age, their flaws, their anachronisms, their generational gaps of knowledge. If the Britannica was the most authoritative popular repository of knowledge during the various eras of its existence, would not its successive treatments of suicide reflect, in a long chronological march, our culture 's changing attitudes toward the subject that had consumed my life? With the help of the Chicago staff of the EB, the New York Public Library, and Harvard 's Houghton Library, I assembled copies of the encyclopedia 's fourteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story -- the attempt, over time, to answer such crucial questions as : Is suicide a sin? Is it a crime? Is it the responsibility of the individual or of society? What causes it? Can human suffering be reduced to statistics? How can suicide be prevented? Should it be prevented? And that story is what is now spread out, with my wife 's indulgence, all over our dining table. <p> The Encyclopaedia Britannica, while not the first encyclopedia -- its forerunners include the remarkable Encyclopedie ou Dictionnaire raisonne des Sciences, des Arts et des Metiers of Diderot and d'Alembert, published in France starting in 1751 -- has remained the most constant and influential. Its first edition was published in Edinburgh in 1768. There have been fourteen editions since then, of which the Eleventh Edition, of 1910, is generally considered the greatest. Roughly speaking, a new edition was published every ten or twenty years( in the interim there were sometimes several printings with minor variations) until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half century, there were only relatively modest alterations : some articles were dropped, some added, some contributors replaced. With the Fifteenth Edition, in 1974, there was a radical restructuring of the overall format of the EB : the timehonored, strictly alphabetical arrangement was dropped in favor of a thesaurus-like approach, including a one-volume Propaedia( an overview), a Micropaedia( a comprehensive survey), and a Macropaedia( topics discussed in detail). The latest version of the Britannica, " published " in 1994, is on CD-ROM -- a hundred pounds of books reduced to about an ounce. <p> There was no article on suicide in the first edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. That is understandable ; the word itself was fairly new.( The words suicide and encyclopedia seem to have a common vintage and perhaps even a common creator. The vintage is the fifth decade of the seventeenth century, 1642 for suicide and 1646 for encyclopedia ; the creator is Sir Thomas Browne, the author of Religio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second Edition of the EB was published, it contained a memorable article called " Self-Murder. " <p> " Self-Murder " is one page long. Whatever else can be said about it, it is not dull. It jerks you awake with the first sentence, hectors and shakes you until the finish, and, at the very end, makes an unconvincing attempt to soften its Draconian stance. It has the smell of fire and brimstone, the sound of a wrathful sermon by Cotton Mather. The article begins with a beautifully expressed but horrendously cruel definition : " SELF-MURDER, the pretended heroism, but real cowardice, of the Stoic philosophers, who destroyed themselves to avoid those ills which they had not the fortitude to endure, though the attempting it seems to be countenanced by the civil law, yet was punished by the Athenian law with cutting off the hand which committed the desperate deed. " It continues in a vein that joins the religious and the legal : <p> And also the law of England wisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to destroy life but by commission from God and the author of it ; and as the suicide is guilty of a double offence ; one spiritual, in invading the prerogative of the Almighty, and rushing into his immediate presence uncalled for ; the other temporal, against the king, who hath an interest in the preservation of all his subjects ; the law has therefore ranked this among the highest crimes, making it a peculiar species of felony ; a felony committed on one 's self. <p> And it concludes with an answer to the obvious question : If the felon is dead, how can human laws punish him? <p> They can only act upon what he has left behind him, his reputation and fortune ; on the former, by an ignominious burial in the highway, with a stake driven through his body ; or the latter, by a forfeiture of all his goods and chattels to the king, hoping that his care for either his own reputation or the welfare of his family would be some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act.... And tho ' it must be owned that the letter of the law herein borders a little on severity ; yet it is some alleviation, that the power of mitigation is left in the breast of the sovereign, who upon this( as on all other occasions) is reminded by the oath of his office, to execute judgment in mercy. <p> The last sentence strikes me as conveying the same dubious comfort as a hangman 's blessing. The anonymous author of this mean-spirited little article -- whose only mention of prevention is its approving note on the custom, prevalent at the time, of besmirching the self-murderer 's reputation and confiscating his worldly goods -- is clearly far more interested in flagellating the suicide than in keeping him alive. <p> By 1788, when the Third Edition was published, the word suicide had gained sufficient currency to constitute the article 's title. And this time the EB had much more to say : five pages ' worth, starting with a far briefer and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, or the person who commits it. " The first section of the article is a historical survey of suicide among the Jews, the ancient Greeks, the Brahmins, the Hindus, the Japanese, the Scythians, the tribes of Scandinavia, and others. The tone of this report can be gathered from the paragraph on suicide among the Jews : <p> Suicide is one of those crimes which we are led to believe not common among savage nations. The first instances of it recorded in the Jewish history are those of Saul and Ahitophel ; for we do not think the death of Samson a proper example. We have no reason to suppose it became common among the Jews till their wars with the Romans, when multitudes slaughtered themselves that they might not fall alive into the hands of their enemies. But at this period the Jews were a most desperate and abandoned race of men, had corrupted the religion of their fathers, and rejected that pure system which their promised Messiah came to Jerusalem to announce. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until 1852. <p> As for the causes of suicide in England, they are ascribed to " the variableness of the climate, the great use of animal food, strong spiritous liquors and to tea, and to the sulphurous exhalations of the pit-coal used as fuel.... We are rather surprised that coal is mentioned even as a distant cause of suicide, for it is one of the blessings of our island ; and a good coal fire we have always found rather conducive to good spirits rather than injurious to them. " It is rare to find such a cozy passage in the staid pages of the EB. <p> Having disposed of history and causation, the article moves on to the aspects that had constituted the entirety of the 1777 article : the morality and legality of suicide. It reasserts that suicide is a felo-de-se( a felony against oneself), a crime against God and the king. But it ends with a sentence that indicates that the times are changing : " Suicide, we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a difficult matter to find an effectual remedy.... Punishment will not be a preventive, even if it could be always inflicted ; and that it is seldom inflicted, though the laws have decreed it, is well known. " This Concluding emphasis on prevention, complete with a humble acknowledgment of its difficulty, sounds surprisingly modern. <p> The historical portions of this entry appeared essentially unchanged for sixty-four years in the Fourth( 1801), Fifth( 1815), Sixth( 1820), and Seventh( 1830) Editions. <p> But changes were coming. The entry for " Suicide " in the Eighth Edition( 1852-1860) in many ways repeats the contents of the Seventh. However, it is notable for including landmark quotations from two major nineteenth-century intellectual figures. <p> The first quotation is from Henry Thomas Buckle, chess prodigy and scientifically minded historian. Buckle believes that " the progress of every people is regulated by principles... as certain as those which govern the physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide rates over years and points to the folly of enacting laws against it. He states that <p> suicide is merely the product of the general condition of society, and that the individual only carries into effect what is a necessary consequence of preceding circumstance... thus we are able to predict within a small limit of error the number of voluntary deaths for each ensuing period, assuming, of course, that the social circumstances do not undergo marked change. <p> Buckle 's morally neutral stance, which transfers blame from the individual to his society, neatly moves suicide from the purview of religion to that of social science and presages the key role that demography was soon to play in its study. <p> The second quotation is from the great philosopher and economist John Stuart Mill. In his essay " On Liberty " -- in which he opposed any legislation that would interfere with the sale of poisons on the ground that it would exert unnecessary state control over individual freedom-he wrote( and is quoted in the 1860 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a necessity, but only a danger of mischief, no one but the person himself can judge of the sufficience of the motive which may prompt him to incur the risk of buying poison. In this case therefore( unless he is a child, or delirious or in some state of excitement or absorption incompatible with the full use of the reflecting faculty), he ought, I conceive, be only warned of the danger, not forcibly prevented from exposing himself to it. <p> This prescient paragraph contains the core arguments of current controversies and debates : Do people own their own lives( and deaths), or are we as a society responsible for saving our fellows from their own errors? <p> Mill 's libertarian voice was destined to be outshouted by the subsequent inundation of articles that concentrated on numbers rather than ethics. The Ninth Edition( 1875-1889) contains a six-page article by Wynnard Hooper, a financial journalist who, tellingly, also wrote the pieces on statistics and population.( This was the edition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, remember reading this article then.) Hooper includes five tables of European suicide statistics and one table for certain American states, and discusses these figures in terms of race, sex, climate, population density, occupations, seasons, and methods of suicide. He concludes that " it can not be said that any satisfactory result has been obtained from these investigations, owing no doubt to the fact that the phenomenon is too minute to furnish numbers large enough for the proper application of the statistical method. " His article marks a radical swing to the demographic and statistical approach, reflecting and foreshadowing the work of Morselli, Durkheim, Halbwachs, and Dublin. It cut the pattern for the next hundred years. <p> The Tenth Edition( 1902) contains an unmemorable two-page article, essentially a shortened version of the article in the previous edition, by H. H. Littlejohn, a professor of forensic medicine at the University of Edinburgh. Littlejohn also wrote the article on suicide in the great Eleventh Edition of 1910 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Like Buckle and Hooper, Littlejohn regards suicide as " a sign of the presence of maladies in the body politic which deserve careful consideration. " He asserts that " suicide as a whole conforms to certain general laws, and is influenced by conditions other than mere individual circumstances or surroundings. " His article, mainly concerned with British suicide statistics for the 1880s and 1890s, was repeated in the Twelfth( 1921) and Thirteenth( 1926) Editions. <p> The article on suicide in the Fourteenth Edition( 1929-1940) went through numerous versions in different printings. The first, in 1929, was a two-page article by S. de Jastrzebski, the assistant registrar general of Great Britain, that included updated figures for sex and age and for methods of suicide in England and Wales as well as an interesting and highly topical section on the " Influence of the World War " : <p> The following figures for 1911-1914, 1915-1918, 1921-1925, relating as they do to nine of the belligerent countries and two non-belligerents closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt the profound effect produced upon the suicide-rate by the World War.... In every case the war period is marked by a notable decline in the suicide-rate. To the theory that nervous strain is one of the prime causes which lead to self-destruction, they give a complete and emphatic contradiction. <p> The 1955-1961 printings of the Fourteenth Edition contained a short piece by Ruth S. Cavan, an American sociologist, which was perhaps the most succinct and most comprehensive to date. Within the compass of a single page, it includes pithy paragraphs on a variety of subtopics : international comparisons ; age, sex, and marital conditions ; urban-rural rates ; methods of suicide ; suicide and other means of violent death ; and interpretations. Cavan concludes : <p> Although suicide rates differ with various social conditions, the explanation does not lie in external forces but in the attitudes and emotions of people.... Some people are subjected to greater social pressures than others. Finally, some countries provide more adequate guidance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may turn for help. <p> This brief bit of wisdom touches both the inner and the outer worlds of suicide with more empathy than any of Cavan 's predecessors had shown. <p> My turn came in 1973, in an article that deliberately owed little to its forerunners. Its seven pages contained not a single statistical table.( As I reread them in the company of the other articles on my dining table, I felt that in my urge to rescue the study of suicide from the numbing forces of statistics, I had gone too far and given short shrift to the field 's legitimate demographic aspects.) The sections included : definition, complexities of definitions, major threads of study, psychological characteristics of suicide, attempted suicide, partial death and substitutes for suicide, suicide and religion, suicide and the law, myths about suicide, romantic suicide and the artist, statistics on suicide, suicide notes, and **35;476;TOOLONG. <p> One example will suffice to convey the article 's general tenor. Under " Main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the locus of blame for suicide. Saint Augustine and Saint Thomas Aquinas called suicide a grievous sin and located its source within the deficient person ; Rousseau emphasized the natural and innocent state of man and transferred the locus of blame from man to society ; Hume tried to sanitize suicide entirely by arguing that it was neither a crime nor a sin ; Durkheim focused on society 's inimical effects on the individual ; and Freud, eschewing the notions of sin and crime, gave suicide back to the individual but put the main locus of action in the unconscious mind. In other words, I attempted to present a variety of views on suicide instead of the single opinions that had dominated most of the earlier articles. My own expressed opinion is that each instance of suicide is a multidimensional event( with biological, physiological, sociocultural, and existential components), but that the main trunk of the suicidal tree is the psychological drama that occurs in the individual 's mind : the need to escape from unbearable psychological pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death or cessation as the effective exit. Here is the heart of what -- now that I have read all the earlier articles -- I feel the EB had previously omitted : a recognition of suicide as a response to individual human suffering, a tragedy that befalls real people. <p> This article had a noteworthy personal consequence. For many years -- from 1950, when I met him, until his death in 1988 at the age of ninety-five -- the psychological epicenter of my intellectual life was Henry A. Murray : physician, psychoanalyst, biologist, Melville scholar, director of the Harvard Psychological Clinic, and author of Explorations in Personality.( There is a marvelous portrait of Henry Murray in the winter 1969 issue of THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR, by then-editor Hiram Haydn.) Murray 's peerless writings influenced me more than any others, and I tried to spend as much time as possible in his presence. I was at Harvard for two extended stays -- as research associate in the early sixties and as visiting professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as often as I could arrange it. It was one of life 's high privileges for me to know him and to be made, by him, much more than I otherwise could have been. <p> In 1963, in a paper about Melville titled " Dead to the World, " Murray had defined suicide as " no more than an urgently felt necessity to stop unbearable anguish, that is, to obtain relief by interrupting the stream of suffering. " He asked : " For what is suicide in most instances but an action to put an end to intolerable affect? " You can see right away that my main ideas about the central role in suicide of psychological pain and negative emotions all flow from his fountain. In any event, in February 1973, Harry wrote me : <p> Your encyclopaedia article is masterful... handsomely written to a marked extent in your own terminology. I could n't help thinking that this was possibly the timely moment to consider a shift in focus of spirit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paragraph changed my life. I knew Harry well enough to put aside his hyperbolic praise and to know that the real meat of that paragraph -- his covertly intended message -- lay in the serious criticism implied in the second sentence. He was telling me what I already knew inside : that I was temporarily burned out on the topic of suicide and ought to consider a shift of focus for a while. Harry 's note resonated with my own suspicion, which I had not fully admitted to myself until I read his words, that my EB article had been a mite too discursive and idiosyncratic. Accordingly, I shifted my clinical focus from patients who were suicidal to cancer patients who were coming to death unwillingly. I transformed myself from clinical suicidologist to clinical thanatologist, someone who deals with illness and mourning. When I returned to suicide a few years later, I believe I did so with a refreshed vision of self-destruction as well as a better understanding of the dynamics involved in the wrestling match with death. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My piece was superseded in the Fifteenth Edition( 1974-1984) by a wise and comprehensive five-page article by the late Erwin Stengel, professor of psychiatry at the University of Sheffield. Its most innovative section is headed " Suicide in the Future, " and Stengel 's predictions are not particularly rosy. He writes : <p> It is difficult to imagine man in the future without this potential, which has sometimes been proclaimed as one of the basic human freedoms. There are no prospects of an antisuicidal substance in the foreseeable future. There are certain aspects of present-day society that make a decline in the incidence of suicidal acts unlikely including the increased number of the aged... the young who are more openly aggressive... the continued increase in population. The outlook for suicide would be very black indeed if it were not for the strong urge to self-preservation inherent in the individual and in society. The emergence of nonprofessional movements toward self-help in the struggle against suicide can be seen as a manifestation of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thoroughly understood the value of statistics, also understood that suicide is a philosophical act. This is manifestly an encyclopedia article and not a novel. But Stengel 's empathetic sadness, deepened by his own background as a refugee from the Nazis, clearly shows through his prose and, in my view, makes it finer. Inexplicably, there are printings of the Fifteenth Edition in which Stengel 's indispensable essay on suicide does not appear. In these cases, I strongly advise the reader to seek another printing. <p> In the 1985-1997 printings of the Fifteenth Edition there is a half-page article in the Micropaedia( Stengel 's piece is in the Macropaedia). Its concluding paragraph is especially topical : <p> No single approach can be expected to succeed in substantially reducing the incidence of suicide, but early detection and treatment of mental disorders are important deterrents. Since the 1950s special centres and organizations for the prevention of suicide have been created in many countries.... The telephone is commonly used as a means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and advisers who are available by day and night. There is evidence that this kind of service may help to avert suicidal acts. <p> The Encyclopaedia Britannica -- along with our society -- has obviously traveled several light-years since 1777, when it excoriated suicide as cowardly, sinful, illegal, and shameful. The emphasis has shifted to the question, " How can we help? " <p> My march through the centuries is complete, but a few ideas still swirl in the wake of my dual obsessions, suicide and the EB. The first idea is that there might be something to learn from similar Britannica surveys of other socially sensitive tag words. One might look, from 1768( or whenever the word first appears) to the present date, at Addiction, Adultery, Childhood, Homosexuality, Insanity, and so forth. Scholars in different fields could suggest candidates for the word list. Put together, these would yield a lexicographic history of the past two centuries that might give some fresh insights into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns to the study of suicide. Why not take a look at the word in dictionaries of the past couple of hundred years? Authoritative definitions are important. Indeed, dictionaries might provide us with a microcosm of what was happening in the encyclopedias of their times. <p> I believe I have good reason, beyond the fact that it is my own field, to think that our society 's views of suicide are important to all of us. I learned from a study I once did with the coroner of Marin County, California, that more than a quarter of all deaths -- all deaths, not just overt suicides -- are probably interlaced with threads of imprudence, disregard, excess, indifference, or ennui that bring an end to life sooner than is necessary. In other words, some people who have died what I call " subintentioned deaths " from heart attacks or automobile accidents may have a good deal in common with people who are termed " suicides. " In that sense alone, suicide is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of moving up the dates on our own tombstones. <p> The definition of any important term such as suicide gives it power-and also gives it honorific, neutral, or pejorative overtones. Denotation influences connotation. The connotative meanings of a word govern society 's responses to it. These community responses can cover a wide range : in the case of suicide, one extreme includes scorn, indifference, and punishment, and the other extreme includes empathy and therapy. And even within the realm of therapy, the very modalities are influenced by definition. Whether the therapeutic response is primarily pharmacological( pills), surgical( lobotomy), electrical( shock), institutional( hospitalization), or psychodynamic( talk) -- differences that are not trivial-may depend on the inner, unspoken definition of suicide and its connotative associations that one 's physician happens to hold. <p> Anthropologically speaking, dictionaries and encyclopedias are the two key books in any literate society. Each of us lives within( or rebels against) the reigning mores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words. Much of our English-American Zeitgeist is reflected in the long history of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. As I look at the piles of articles fanned out on my dining table, I feel that the pages, though they all deal with death, are in some sense alive, and that they are spreading their exhalations into many vast and tiny places. <p> By Edwin Shneidman <p> <p> Edwin Shneidman is Professor of Thanatology Emeritus at UCLA. He was the founder, in 1968, of the American Association of Suicidology, and is the author of Deaths of Man, Voices of Death, Definition of Suicide, and The Suicidal Mind. <p>
