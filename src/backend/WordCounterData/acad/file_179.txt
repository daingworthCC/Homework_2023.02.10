4070741 Istanbul, with its historic sights and culture, great shopping, and vibrant nightlife, attracts a growing number of tourists but still remains something of an undiscovered treasure. However, that is all set to change when Istanbul becomes a European Capital of Culture in 2010. <p> Following in the steps of previous Capitals of Culture such as Glasgow, UK, and Lille, France, Istanbul hopes that the prestigious title will breathe new life into the city and attract more tourists it is expecting between ten and twelve million visitors in 2010. <p> The title will also foster closer links with the EU and will serve as the platform for the regeneration of this great city. " Being selected as a European Capital of Culture will give a boost to the city 's economic and political relations with Europe as well as contributing to its cultural relations, " says Nuri olakoglu, executive chairman of Istanbul 2010, the agency that is overseeing the project. <p> Being a Capital of Culture will provide a showcase for Istanbul 's remarkable history as well as create a legacy for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this project, about 750 million euros of which will be used for the restoration and renovation of world heritage sites, including the restoration of the world famous Topkapi Palace Museum, " says Mr. olakoglu. But there will also be an emphasis on new venues, Mr. olakoglu explains : " Istanbul is one of the most important cities in the world in terms of cultural heritage, but it does n't have enough artistic and cultural spaces, so we will create new ones. " <p> New museums will be established to protect and display cultural assets, and historical buildings will be renovated, given new roles, and opened to the public. The Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality is converting the historic slaughterhouse on the Golden Horn( Hali) into a performing arts and conference center and the Ayazaga Cultural Center, under construction since 1995, is set to be the biggest arts venue in Turkey by 2010. <p> Mr. olakoglu says that Capital of Culture status wo n't just benefit tourists but all the people of Istanbul.

Ahu Kerimoglu Aysal, owner of the luxurious Htel Les Ottomans, which is located on the shores of the Bosporus and is a favorite with the international jet set, says, " When I was living abroad, I was able to see what Istanbul needed a hotel that represents our Ottoman ancestors. We send a Rolls Royce to the airport to pick up our guests and then they are transported to a boat and brought to the hotel. Then they go back home and tell everyone they stayed in a beautiful Ottoman palace. " <p> And as the world 's gaze turns to Istanbul in 2010, it will bring long-term effects making the city a year-round destination, drawing in more business conventions, and attracting the cruise market. <p> Raul Salcido, manager of the Ritz-Carlton hotel, one of Istanbul 's top luxury hotels, says that more conferences, delegations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city. He adds, " I always tell our guests that there are many fascinating sides of Istanbul waiting to be discovered. It is a blissful city of contrasts, where you find history, exotic arts and music, wonderful food, an amazing culture, and, of course, the strategic location. " <p> " Being selected as a European Capital of Culture will give a boost to the city 's economic and political relations with Europe.
