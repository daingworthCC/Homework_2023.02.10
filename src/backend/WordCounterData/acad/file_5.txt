4000641 Quaesivit arcana poli videt dei.( " He sought the secret of the Pole but found the hidden face of God. ") -- inscription, Scott Polar Institute, Cambridge <p> <p> Everyone has an Antarctic. -- Thomas Pynchon, V. <p> <p> As a child I was home-schooled on an old schooner in various anchorages along the Gulf Coast of Florida. In a corner of our paneled dark mahogany main cabin sat a globe that turned reluctantly on a rusty metal stand. Rubbing my fingers along the buckled seams of the pasted-on sections of world map, I brooded over the shapes of the continents and the way they seemed to match each other like pieces of a giant puzzle. Florida 's jagged, concave inner curve, if you swept assorted West Indies island bits and pieces along with it, locked boldly onto the north rim of South America, whose eastern edge, like any good jigsaw piece, snapped into place under the jutting bulge of West Africa. Joining the land masses in my head produced in me a pleasure too intense to put into words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continents had united in a single Gondwanaland. <p> I was precociously anticipating, in the early 1950s, the rehabilitation of a then-discredited theory. Continental drift is one of those curious instances where the techniques of empirical science converge with a long-standing human tendency to project inner psychological contents -- images of wholeness, and ultimately of the self -- onto the physical contours of our planet. That this identification is an ancient one in Western culture, and that it continues to flourish long past its allotted historical moment, is the subject of this essay. <p> Representations of planet Earth as a topos of the human psyche derive from the pre-Enlightenment cosmological framework of sympathetic correspondences in which hierarchies of beings in an animate cosmos were believed to function equivalently : the heavens are mirrored, great to small, in the human body and( especially once its roundness was established) in Earth itself. Microcosm and macrocosm converge in the rotundum, the spherical container -- cosmos, globe, and human soul. Renaissance natural philosophers drew their notions directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Plato in the Timaeus, is a perfect living animal, feeding on its own waste, with no need of eyes or ears since there is nothing outside to see or hear, that also happens to possess the perfect form : " a sphere, without organs or limbs, rotating on its axis. " The Republic presents the cosmos as eight hollow concentric spheres set inside each other like " nested bowls " with Earth at the center. The celestial axis holds the Earth still while the three Fates at the North Pole -- apex of the Earth and its interface with the celestial axis and heaven -- wheel the spheres and their attached fixed stars around it. Here Plato also describes " openings in the sky " where souls depart after death and " openings in the earth " where they return to be reborn, later identified by the Neoplatonist Porphyry as the northernmost and southernmost points of the zodiac, or the apex and nadir of the heavens. <p> Though the idea of a round Earth would be abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retained the concept of concentric circles to describe the relationship between our terrestrial regions and the heavens. Meanwhile the Platonic rotundum endured in Western consciousness in other forms. The Hellenistic sciences of the animate cosmos, alchemy and astrology, were preserved by Arab alchemists and widely disseminated in Europe after the twelfth century C.E. Through their experiments in transmuting " living " metals, the Christian and Muslim alchemists of Europe and the Middle East undertook the investigation of their own souls as well as their outer-world materials ; the steps of the Great Work that changed lead to gold, or the prima materia to the lapis or Philosopher 's Stone, were thought to work a similar effect on the experimenter 's psyche by creating a mystic unio between spirit and matter, a conjunction of the macrocosmic and microcosmic on a single plane of existence. This dual transformation occurred, not coincidentally, within yet another perfect sphere -- the alchemist 's crucible, that oval Vase of Hermes, the egg or vessel that was, by sympathetic connection, the heavenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Copernican revolution and the new empirical sciences converted cosmic forces to telluric ones, the focus of attention shifted downward from the celestial and ethereal spheres to the newly valorized elemental sphere, and Earth became the important level in the geocosmic hierarchy. The physical features and sacral nature of the celestial spheres were increasingly downloaded, as it were, onto the orbis Terrarum( Fig. 1). As all the classical attributes of the cosmic spheres -- equator, tropics, and poles -- were transferred directly to the Earth, ontology became, in a very, literal way, geology. Ironically, even as the new sciences put the notion of an animate universe under active attack, the old guard found it no strain at all to fit a spherical Earth into the resonating symbolic framework of Pythagoras, Plato, and Ptolemy. For seventeenth-century alchemists -- unregenerate Neoplatonists still " comprehending, " in Boberr Flood 's words of a previous century, " the true core of natural bodies, " not just the puny " quantitative shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet another level of correspondence in the hierarchy of Hermetic vessels( Fig. 2). <p> Nonalchemists proved equally adept in pouring the old wine into new glasses. Just as the pole star was thought by the ancients to mark a hole in the heavens, the earthly poles were now believed to mark holes in the planet. In his Mundus subterraneus( 1664), the Jesuit Athanasius Kircher described ocean currents as subterranean waters rushing out of an enormous vortex at the South Pole to converge in a giant whirlpool that sucked them back under in a second hole at the North Pole( Fig. 3). In 1692, the astronomer Edmund Halley advanced the theory that the Earth is composed of a series of inner concentric spheres capable of sustaining life. The most fascinating document of the rapidly expiring Platonic natural philosophy of this era, however, is Thomas Burnet 's Telluris sacra theoria( 1689), revised and expanded in an English version, The Sacred Theory of the Earth( 1690/91). Burnet, master of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and John Tillotson, presented his explanation of the divine plan as manifested in the natural laws of Earth 's physical development. Regarded by its author as a devout work of " Christian geology " but by others as highly heretical, The Sacred Theory represents a last-ditch effort to bridge the widening gap between the old and new sciences. <p> Carrying through a tradition of medieval Christian Neoplatonism out of Pythagoreanism, Burner describes Earth as a " Mundane Egg, " with the shell the Earth 's ernst and its interior the yolk. He posits an historical sequence of three Earths : first, out of Chaos, an original Edenic orb that was a fixed star, a Platonic rotundum of unblemished smoothness and regularity ; then the present " broken Globe " whose continents, crevices, mountains and other irregularities are a consequence of its humanlike Fall( a sixteen-hundred-year process of geological " moral degeneration " in which a flood erupted from waters already lying within the hollow Earth) ; and finally a third millennial Earth, restored to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resurrected righteous will rule for a thousand years until, after a final epic fire, the planet will metamorphose once again into a fixed star. <p> It is alchemy as implicit subtext, however, that rules the metaphorical structure of The Sacred Theory. In the story of Burnet 's planet, whose rivers flow like arterial blood and whose fissures embody moral decay, we see geological, cultural, and spiritual transmutations nostalgically coincide. The cyclic births and deaths of Burnet 's first and second Earth are virtually identical with the transmutation process, and the Earth itself makes an ideal crucible. The perfection of this Edenic Earth is ruptured by a Kircherian " Great Abysse " near the Pole that unleashes subterranean waters onto the Earth 's surface in an alchemical dissolutio or Flood to produce the split-apart land masses of its present fallen state( Fig. 4). After purging in a " Refiner 's fire, " Earth will be transmuted by a coniunctio of earthly and divine into its ultimate lapis status as a fixed star. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision of planet Earth also functions as a kind of sacred theory of the psyche. Within the individual human, the apocalyptic sequence occurs as a profound interior transformation of the personality. Much like the tree-cum-Cross protagonist of the Old English Dream of the Rood, Earth is a character whose progress we follow in a bildungsroman narrative of high adventure. Its fall from rotundum to " mighty Ruine " mirrors the human misfortune, its continental drift the emergence of the specific personal topography of character that spoils the perfect regularity of the undifferentiated prelapsarian soul. Both self and globe will regain their perfection after the Resurrection. Winding up his story, Burnet bids an affectionate goodbye, as to a familiar figure : " There we leave Earth ; Having conducted it for the space of Seven Thousand Years, through various changes from a dark Chaos to a bright Star. " <p> The intertwined apocalyptic destiny of self and globe, as we will see, is a theme Burnet 's literary heirs in the twentieth century will often return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Burnet as a redactor of the old science was already a marginal figure. From the next century 's perspective, Erasmus Darwin 's syncretic conceits in The Botanic Garden( 1791) -- his millennial vision, for example, of " Nymphs " towing icebergs to the equator to equalize the climates, thereby allowing Earth to return to its Edenic state -- would seem even quainter. For eighteenth-century Westerners, alchemy and the sympathetic identifications had been increasingly exiled to the realm of ornamental metaphor and -- for wits like Pope -- outright satire. Though Neoplatonic metaphors continued to exert a strong influence on the new empiricists and vestiges of the old Naturphilosophie would be revived by Goethe, Humboldt, and others well into the nineteenth century, after the Renaissance " the means of internalizing the cosmos, " as Ernest Tuveson has said, would be " by the aesthetic " rather than natural science. We must look to literary, not scientific, descendants of Fluddian natural philosophy for the continuing identification of self with globe and cosmos. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary genre of mystical geography out of the same mixture of Christian and classical sources drawn on by the old sciences. From Dante to John Bunyan, the quest literature of Christianity had always boasted authors who, much like the classical and medieval mnemonists, created their own special kind of inner topography. In the concrete allegory of these narratives, outer and inner worlds describe each other ; the spiritual journey enacts itself in the physical journey, and vice versa. Unlike the discourse of natural philosophy, however, the underlying terms of this literary genre were not immediately -- and in some eases, never -- erased by the rapidly changing philosophical, religious, and scientific worldview of the Enlightenment and later. From the Romantic era on, this Neoplatonic tradition would be carried on in a distinct group of literary sea and adventure narratives that, while ostensibly imitating the real feats of Western explorers circumnavigating the globe, became the vehicle for a new kind of soul quest through the geocosm. <p> " O vast Rondure, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to identity himself as " a Kosmos "), PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> The new secularized quest narratives embodied considerably more than " passage to India, " however. Now as earlier, this spiritualizing of physical geography would require that the journey be undertaken by real people and start at a quantifiable point in time and space in the physical world precisely in order to end up in an internalized soul region outside time and space. Using the topographical allegorizing of the religious narratives, they would also oblige their readers to employ, within their own interpretative process, the analogic principles of the old discarded science. For the Romantics and their literary heirs, the artist became Robert Fludd 's Pan who fashions a world that is the perfect mirror of his own insides. Coleridge and Poe would imagine their journeys in a Hermetic mode, creating visionary landscapes in which elements are first hypothesized, then appear ; possibilities are entertained, then materialize. What M. H. Abrams called the Romantics ' " habitual reading of passion, life and physiognomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notions of the Imago Mundi as a mirror of the human soul, contributes the same Demiurgic framing to what I have called elsewhere " psychotopographic literature " of the twentieth century, expressionist fiction in which, naively or deliberately, inner psychic processes are projected sympathetically onto an exterior landscape. <p> Nowhere is this complicated Renaissance heritage more strikingly apparent than in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Western fictional narratives of journeys to the Poles, and particularly( because of its greater remoteness) to the South Pole. The historical path of this identification follows the same development as that for the Earth generally. Pole began as an astronomical term( Greek polos, axis or sky, Latin polus), first as the entire axis of the celestial sphere, then as the two fixed points in the celestial sphere around which the stars seemed to revolve. By the sixteenth century, pole signified the two points at which the earth 's axis met the celestial sphere.( Similarly, Arktos the Bear, the northern constellation, and anti-Arktos, its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Earth their names.) <p> The term pole was also extended to each of the two opposite points on the surface of a magnet, which aligns itself north-south. The magnetic poles of the earth are these two points in the North and South Poles, respectively, where the compass needle takes a vertical position. The magnet, of course, was a crucial tool for mariners in finding their way( lodestone, the old word for magnet, means literally " way-stone "). Thus the Poles, in both their " true " and " magnetic " manifestations, are orienting points. In microcosmic terms, this means they are the orienting loci of the psyche, but by the same token they are also the least known, the farthest from consciousness, the points( inherent in the notion of polarity) where the transcendent and celestial spheres have special access to the human sphere. <p> This association is reinforced in Western fantastic representations across the centuries that present the outer, geographic Poles as either Hells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the inhabited part of the Earth, in a northern temperate zone that had a southern counterpart, the " Antipodes, " on the lower side of the sphere -- a region the Pythagoreans had earlier dubbed the " Antiehthones " because they believed it to be a separate celestial body, an alter orbis completely distinct from our planet. Lucretius and other ancient commentators, however, derided the idea of an inhabited southern area because their position on the sphere( literally " antipodes ") would oblige these people to hang upside down by their feet. Nonetheless, the belief in a large southern land region led Ptolemy in the second century C.E. to posit the " Terra Australis Incognita, " a southern continent completely enclosing the Indian Ocean -- an hypothesis that would be accepted as geographical fad for the next fifteen hundred years. <p> The tradition of the Antichthones and Antipodes as a region of reversals contra naturam was similarly transferred into medieval Christian geography : Higden 's fourteenth-century Polychronicon, for example, contains a mappemonde detailing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fariei, Virgogiei, Troglodytes ") ', in Paradise Lost Milton located a " frozen continent " in Hell. Even as late as the eighteenth century, Shaftesbury could comment, about his map of nature : " In the places most remote from man 's works and occupations we encounter the manifestation of the divine Mind pure and undefiled. " Out of this tradition comes the implicit identification of the Poles with the furthest unknown reaches of the self/world and, for that very reason, with its transcendent center as well. For what is farthest away and most hidden is, paradoxically, always what is most important : the journey to the pole is a journey to the center of the soul. <p> A mystic or occult notion of both Poles also figures strongly in alchemists ' speculations about the resonating inner and outer worlds. C. G. Jung -- the twentieth century 's only notable Hermetic philosopher disguised as a psychologist, and not coincidentally a fervent student of alchemical literature -- uncovered numerous references to the Poles in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " Philalethes " asserts that since the magnet has a hidden center which turns toward the Pole, thus <p> in the Pole is found the heart of Mercurius, which is the true fire wherein its Lord has his rest. He who journeys through this great and wide sea may touch at both Indies, may guide his course by the sight of the North Star, which our Magnet will cause to appear to you. <p> Jung interprets this passage as a description of the psyche 's irresistible journey or impetus toward wholeness, that is, <p> the Deus absconditus( hidden God) who dwells at the North Pole and reveals himself through magnetism. His other synonym is mercurius, whose heart is to be found at the Pole, and who guides men on the perilous voyage over the sea of the world. The idea is that the whole machinery of the world is driven by the infernal life at the North Pole, that this is hell, and that hell is a system of upper powers reflected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Pole " was " a cross from which the four directions radiate " ; that the quest to reach the Pole is symbolic of striving for " wholeness as the goal to which the ' archaic appetite ' points, the magnetic north which gives the traveller his bearings on the ' sea of the world. ' " <p> In the sharply diverging post-Enlightenment histories of natural philosophy and nautical exploration, however, we may safely identify a single shared moment of harmonic convergence : Sunday, 30 December 1774, when Captain James Cook on his journey to the Southern Ocean in the Adventure reached latitude 71 10 's. In place of Ptolemy 's Terra Australis Incognita and a mystic circulus australis there was now a real Antarctic Circle, and a real ship had just penetrated it. Deciding because of the " immense Icefields " that he " could not proceed one Inch farther South, " however, Cook concluded there was no southern land mass enclosing the Indian Ocean from the south. <p> Samuel Taylor Coleridge had read Cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume of his Neoplatonic muses " Iamblichus, Proclus, Psellus, and Hermes Trismegistus " that he purchased in x796 and carried everywhere in his pocket. Whereas Mary Shelley would have her Frankenstein 's Creature disappear into the " darkness and distance " of the Arctic, the South Pole 's greater remoteness seduced Coleridge sufficiently to transpose his extensive readings in Arctic literature to the Southern Ocean when he composed The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, first published in 1798 in Lyrical Ballads and revised in 1800. <p> Universally recognized as " the travelogue of a spiritual journey, " the Ancient Mariner is a profoundly alchemical and elemental poem that most closely resembles the medieval dream vision whose landscape provides fixed points for meditation and self-reflection. Coleridge 's unique amalgam of physical and soul journey was to set the pattern of the southern journey for his many imitators in Western literature : an archetypal sea-trip from a bustling port( consciousness) to Terra Australis Ineognita( unconsciousness), where a transcendental encounter occurs that initiates either integration of the self or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In a not surprising convergence of influences, the poem begins with a quote from Burnet 's Archaeologiae Philosophicae attesting to the reality of Neoplatonic spirits in the air around us. In Burnetian( or even Miltonian) terms, if humans lost their inner vision at the Fall, a journey to the Pole must involve an initial failure to recognize that the journey has an esoteric as well as an exoteric meaning ; this failure must produce catastrophe followed by suffering and eventual redemption. And this is exactly what happens in the Ancient Mariner : a man blind to his inner spirit( the albatross) kills it, but is redeemed when he experiences love for God 's creatures( the sea-snakes) as his ship or body journeys on the larger Body of the globe, pushed by angelic forces in a harrowing voyage of self-discovery. Ultimately, the " lonesome Spirit from the south pole " guides the mariner 's boat back to civilization, where it sinks in a maelstrom, leaving him the sole survivor.( This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounter with an ill-omened white creature.) The journey to the furthest unknown recesses of the psyche discovers a positive force there that supports the ego 's act of self-redemption. We take it as a good psychotopographic sign that the sinking occurs dose to the Ekemene, home base in Europe, because that suggests the experience inflicted on the mariner is more accessible to his( and the reader 's) consciousness than any action taking place at the Pole itself. <p> In the two voices of the Ancient Mariner -- one a pre-Shakespearean sixteenth-century balladeer and the other his Percylike antiquarian commentator, from roughly Burnet 's time -- Coleridge 's obvious strategy, as Jerome McGann and others have shown, is to reproduce not just the flavor of an archaic ballad, but a sense, as in the Old and New Testaments, of multiple textual layers. In fact, the poem amounts to a kind of self-contained Burnetian geological process of its own, a little evolving world of complex textual strata. As in The Sacred Theory, cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The contrasting layers reinforce our sense of the poem and its craggy fissures as no perfect rotundum but a self-conscious and all-too-human Burnetian " mighty Ruine. " <p> When Edgar Allan Poe 's The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym was published in 1838, the same year that the U.S.-sponsored Wilkes expedition departed for the Southern Ocean, the Antarctic continent had still not been reached, and its very existence was uncertain. Poe, like Coleridge, drew heavily on explorers ' accounts, but even more heavily on the old notions of the animate universe : in the warm waters he bestows on the Antarctic Ocean we see the classical legends of the warm waters of Hyperborea, the land behind the North Wind. More specifically, he uses the then-popular theories of John Cleves Symmes, an army captain turned natural philosopher who postulated a hollow earth composed of five concentric spheres( projecting the structure of the Ptolemaic cosmos, as the Renaissance natural philosophers did, directly onto Earth) accessible through holes near the North and South Poles. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Symzonia : A Voyage of Discovery( 1820), by " Captain Adam Seaborn, " probably Symmes himself. Considered the first piece of American utopian fiction, Symzonia describes Captain Seaborn 's most American determination to discover a " new and untried world " because " the resources of the known world have been exhausted by research, its wealth monopolized, its wonders of curiosity explored, its every thing investigated and understood! " He navigates his custom-built steamboat to a temperate southern land mass and follows a wide river pouring into a hole at the South Pole to the first of the five layered concentric spheres( Fig. 5). In this land( which " out of gratitude to Capt. Symmes for his sublime theory " he names Symzonia) Seaborn finds a perfect democracy of albino humans governed by a council of Worthies and a Best Man. <p> Symmes 's theory of the hollow earth was enthusiastically propagated by his follower J. N. Reynolds, whose treatises on the South Pole were both reviewed by Poe and inserted verbatim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bailey once suggested, might just as easily have been titled Pymzonia). Widely disseminated in the early nineteenth century, Symmes 's notions passed into popular folklore as the polar " Symmes Hole, " a belief that kept its currency among hollow earth cultists in America and Europe well into the twentieth century. In 1906 a sixteen-year-old H. P. Lovecraft wrote a letter to the Providence Daily Journal to refute the theory advanced in a new book, The Phantom of the Poles, " that the earth is a hollow sphere, with openings at the poles. "( It is typical of his contradictory conscious and unconscious agendas that this writer, who prided himself on the rigor of his " scientific materialist " views, went on to create, with enormous gusto, just such a Kircherian globe in his own fictions.) Even after World War II -- as Joseelyn Godwin details in his fascinating study Arktos -- a popular myth arose that Hitler had survived the war in a subterranean Antarctic labyrinth with a legion of flying saucers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own predilections toward the vortex that made the Symmes Hole a perfect fit with the inner structure of his psyche. For even more than the Ancient Manner, Pym is an imagined story in the full sense of the world. In Poe 's only novel, action must be imaginatively anticipated before it can be made manifest, events seem only to proceed while the first-person narrator lies in a swoon, and Pym awakens each time to find himself regressed into ever more outrageously claustrophobic and life-threatening predicaments. This repetitive retreat into lowered or obliterated consciousness is a microcosmic journey to his own self 's Terra Incognita, an ongoing dress rehearsal of the outer journey that will end so obscurely. In the macrocosmic terms of the larger narrative, the apocalypse that Pyre and his comrades rush toward in their small boat( a structurally equivalent act to that chronicled in his stories " MS Found in a Bottle " and " Descent into the Maelstrom ") is also the vortex in the unconscious toward which the conscious ego feels both attraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, are congruent and resonate sympathetically. In the symbolic terms of Poe 's magic cosmos throughout his literary works, falling into a hole or pit is the transforming moment of death, and this recurring private and personal Symmes Hole becomes the inevitable destination in both the smaller and larger predicaments of Pym. It is the reason that Poe can provide no depiction of the South Pole itself, or of Pym 's reaching it. <p> Pym presents its own complicated pastiche of textual fragments recounted by at least three narrators, two of whom are unidentified. " Tekeli'li! " one anonymous commentator obligingly recaps for us after Pym 's own account abruptly breaks off, " was the cry of the affrighted natives of Tsalal upon discovering the carcass of the white animal picked up at sea. " It was also, he continues, <p> the shuddering exclamation of the captive Tsalalian upon encountering the white materials in possession of Mr. Pym. This also was the shriek of the swift-flying, white, and gigantic birds which issued from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant white birds Poe is echoing Coleridge 's albatross, but he engages a " polarity " as well : the black island of Tslalal that intrudes itself before the whiteness. <p> The commentator, however, fails to mention the most striking manifestation of whiteness, namely, the giant " shrouded human figure " with snow-white skin who rises before Pym and his companion Dirk Peters out of the ashy cataract filling the southern polar sky. In Poe, as in Coleridge before him, these mysterious white figures embody the transcendental and unearthly dimension of the southern polar region. In Pym, however, does this figure represent the Anthropos, the macrocosmic Original Man of Gnostic and Jewish belief, as Richard Howard has proposed? Or is perhaps the globe itself the true Anthropos here and the giant figure merely its microcosmic equivalent? The enigmatic, open-ended narrative leaves readers looking over the edge of the Great Abyss with no clear view of what lies below. <p> We may note in passing that when Herman Melville drew on Pym for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only very briefly), and so his descriptions of the landscape of the Southern Ocean are considerably less shadowy and mythic than those of the armchair sailors Poe and Coleridge. Melville 's greater involvement in the world of the senses makes his characters ' pursuit of the whiteness an outer world journey first and an inner world journey by extension rather than the other way around. It is no coincidence, consequently, that Melville 's Anthropos turns out to be a marine mammal, a creature of the elemental world rather than a daemon of the next sphere up. <p> As the nineteenth century wore on, the Romantic world view suffered its own continental drift into the Victorian sentimentality of Arthur Conan Doyle on one hand -- whose supernatural story " The Captain of the ' Pole-star ' "( 1883), in which a tormented ship 's captain meets his end on an Arctic ice floe, pursuing a white insubstantial female form( presumably the ghost of his dead fiancee back in Comwall), contains more than an echo of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the techno-literalism of Jules verne in works like The Sphinx of the Ice Fields( 1897), which Verne composed, according to William Butcher, not only to " completely superimpose itself on Poe 's novel but also to cover it so completely as to virtually block it out. " The mysterious Sphinx that Verne 's explorers are seeking at the South Pole turns out to be a giant magnet that strips their vessel of all its iron ; pinned to the lodestone by a stray musket is none other than the frozen corpse of the explorer Arthur Gordon Pym. This decidedly nonoccult echo of Robert Fludd is typical of Verne 's framing consciousness of nineteenth-century scientific materialism. <p> Much closer in spirit to Poe 's mythic journey is Verne 's Journey to the Center of the Earth( 1864), in which scientists retrace the route of a sixteenth-century Icelandic alchemist reminiscent of Athanasius Kircher( who, though no alchemist, once had himself lowered by ropes into Vesuvius to observe an eruption firsthand). Entering the mundus subterraneus through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands and oceans and are ultimately ejected in an eruption onto the island of Stromboli( earnestly asking a local boy, " Is this the North Pole? " because their compass has been magnetically reversed). Although Verne, like his closest twentieth-century equivalent, the English writer J. G. Ballard, flirts with the sympathetic connections in his primal topographies, the deeper possibility of the " journey to the center of the self, " simply because the narrative stays literalized on the level of physical geography, remains unconscious. Verne 's sensibility proved the enduring trend as it helped initiate the popular genre of science fiction, which rationalized the supernatural into " marvelous machines " capable of accomplishing feats formerly performed by angels, nymphs, and Neoplatonic daemons. <p> A century after Poe, a proponent of the new popular fantastic fiction, H. P. Lovecraft, wrote as both a child of this materialist movement and a rebel against it. Yet another explicit homage to Pym, Lovecraft 's South Pole horror novella At the Mountains of Madness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architectural, depicting inner psychic processes macrocosmically in the globe itself and in the city under the globe 's South Pole. The narrator of Lovecraft 's tale is a geologist who has brought to the Antarctic a remarkable new drill that can go to unplumbed depths.( In the symbolic terms of polar romance this means he is an explorer of unconscious strata of the psyche, or, put another way, what Lovecraft most loathed in conscious life : a psychoanalyst.) The expedition uncovers evidence of a lost civilization beneath the Pole whose extraterrestrial builders -- the Great Old Ones, star-headed beings from another galaxy -- entered the planet via the Antarctic Ocean and built marine cities shortly after the moon was separated from the South Pacific. <p> The heart of the story is the narrator 's exploration of the Old Ones ' colossal abandoned underground city below the South Pole. Penetrating the multileveled labyrinth of this mundus subterraneus becomes the story 's true journey within a journey -- its novelty lying in the suggestion that even as we imagine we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet lies beyond and under, something hostile and deeply threatening to human reason. Like Burnet 's fallen Earth, Lovecraft 's Pole is a decayed realm. " If we could open the Earth, " Burnet said, <p> and go down into the bosom of it, see all the dark Chambers and Apartments there, how ill contriv 'd, and how ill kept, so many holes and corners, some fill 'd with smoak and fire, some with water, and some with vapours and mouldy Air ; how like a ruine it lies gaping and torn in the parts of it. <p> For Lovecraft this region is likewise " a haunted, accursed realm where life and death, space and time, have made black and blasphemous alliances in the unknown epochs since matter first writhed and swam on the planet 's scarce-cooled crust. " The cities of the Old Ones, we learn, were gradually destroyed geologically, by seismic upheavals, the wearing effect of rivers, and similar telluric events. <p> This Burnetian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Terra Incognita regions of the human head, which we penetrate at our peril : the assistant goes mad and the narrator barely escapes with his sanity. Microcosmically, Lovecraft in the person of his narrator is telling us not to push the interior journey too far ; there is a fatal structural flaw built into the composition of the psyche/planet. At the very least, only the inaccessibility of certain regions holds in check the sinister transcendent principle that, unleashed, would overwhelm it. Here, finally, the hole at the Pole definitively converges with the proverbial " hole in the head " signifying madness. Lovecraft would find much to identify with in the French asylum inmate 's diagram from the famous Art brut collection in which the globe is overlaid with a sympathetically connected " interior world " that strikingly resembles a medieval mappemonde( Fig. 6). <p> After Lovecraft the fantastic polar journey continues to flourish in any number of twentieth-century literary and science fiction works. In the Polish writer Stanislaw Lem 's Solaris( 1961) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet entirely covered by a living ocean, a regularized surface of animate matter much like Plato 's sphere and Burnet 's flooded Earth( though its name suggests our own planet 's sun and an opposing element, fire). After a century 's futile attempts to establish contact with this creature, the story opens as Earth scientists have beamed X-rays onto the surface of the ocean from the space station hovering above its surface, to surprising effect : the three resident scientists have been visited by simulacra or " Phicreatures, " materialized projections that are the ocean 's living representations of their secret desires. When Kelvin, a psychologist, arrives from Earth, he is immediately sent the simulacrum of his dead wife-a woman who, it is suggested, killed herself because of his emotional neglect. <p> But the true landscape of Solaris, as Gaston Bachelard has correctly observed of Pym, is an inner one : the interface of consciousness and unconsciousness. In Kelvin 's helpless love for his Phi-creature wife and growing contact with his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( as the name " Kelvin " suggests) hovering above an inaccessible unconsciousness that resists control and, sending back as it does inconvenient messages about their innermost psychic contents, shows far greater knowledge of those who study it than vice versa. The scientists are self-deceiving, narrow Cartesian rationalists detached from their own animal and emotional natures, vainly attempting to control and subjugate their split-off desires under the guise of " communication. " As one disillusioned scientist / explorer puts it, <p> We are searching for an ideal image of our own world : we go in quest of a planet, of a civilization superior to our own but developed on the basis of our primeval past. At the same time, there is something inside us which we do n't want to face up to, from which we try, to protect ourselves.... We arrive here as we are in reality, and when that reality is revealed to us -- that part of our reality which we would prefer to pass over in silence -- then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed, is the classic postcolonialist argument : if the Western imagination does no more than project its own psychic Terra Incognita onto the rest of Earth, then we correctly regard such accounts of these regions as portraits of an alter ego, not an alter orbis. The colonialist 's psychotopographic presumption is to seek the Other and find only his own reflection. Solaris presents the exquisite joke that, for once, rejected contents of the psyche are projected onto an Other who is having none of it and -- to the total psychological undoing of the projectors -- reflects these contents right back to them. <p> Inevitably, the planet Solaris is discovered to contain, Chinese box style, its own alter orbis. As Kelvin and the other scientists move the station toward the planet 's southern polar region, they try beaming Kelvin 's own brain waves into the ocean. Of this same region an earlier scientist, whose suppressed testimony is preserved only in lost notebooks( significantly nicknamed the " Little Apocrypha "), testifies that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean after an astronaut falls in it. Is this, as some hypothesize, the ocean 's representation of an artifact of the drowned man 's memory? Possibly so, but Robert Fludd had this to say on the subject of " polarity " in alchemy : <p> The two polar fundamental principles of the universe are form as the light principle, coming from above, and matter as the dark principle, dwelling in the earth.... In the middle, the sphere of the sun, where these opposing principles just counterbalance each other, there is engendered in the mystery of the chymic wedding the infans Solaris, which is at the same time the liberated world-soul. <p> The ocean, our highly erudite author Lem may be suggesting, could be producing the possibilities of an alchemical coniunctio, or mystic union of spirit and matter, a philosopher 's stone of its own. But what, exactly, does the baby, this " child of the sun, " consist of? Is it materialized spirit or spiritualized matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notion of material imagination as he comes to see the ocean as an " imperfect " or " evolving " god " whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose -- a god who simply is. " In his highly alchemical definition, " this God has no existence outside of matter. He would like to free himself from matter, but he can not. " Hoping to maintain his tenuous connection to transcendence through the strait gate of his now fully accepted love, pain, and loss, Kelvin decides to remain on Solaris. <p> The mystic geography of Thomas Pynchon 's V.( 1963) also owes a great deal to Renaissance natural philosophy. In one of the novel 's intricately interwoven subplots, the English explorer Hugh Godolphin, sent on a routine mapping expedition into the heart of Asia, stumbles upon the land of Vheissu, the first letter of whose name, in this novel 's terms, signals its membership in a macrocosmic hidden pattern that shapes human events all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region whose physical features have the magical ability to change color constantly, like a " tattooed skin " ; its emblematic indigenous species is an iridescent spider monkey. Haunted by visions of Vheissu, Godolphin journeys to its direct opposite, the South Pole. There, " at one of the only two motionless places on this gyratic world "( " a country, " he adds simply, " the demiurge had forgotten "), he discovers, shimmering through several feet of transparent ice, the body of one of Vheissu 's spider monkeys. <p> Besides representing the now-familiar millennial convergence of tropics and pole, this image recalls the display of colors associated with the albedo or whitening, the first major transformation in the alchemical process. Yet we learn that this impossible juxtaposition, " the rainbow-colored spider monkey buried beneath the zero point of absolute stasis, " is only a cruel parody of the mystic unio. An unnamed " They, " says Godolphin, deliberately planted it for him to find, as a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was simply an amusing fabrication of theirs. If this is the ease, then whose fabricated world do Godolphin and all the rest of us live in? Another character speculates on the identity of these mysterious demiurges. " A barbaric and unknown race, " he says, <p> employed by God knows whom, are even now blasting the Antarctic ice with dynamite, preparing to enter a subterranean network of natural tunnels, a network whose existence is known only to the inhabitants of Vheissu, the Royal Geographic Society in London, Herr Godolphin, and the spies of Florence. <p> In the elaborate tapestry of V., the rulers of the sublunary sphere are able to elude identification by hiding behind the visible pattern of the natural world.( Or, conversely, in a familiar modernist twist, they may represent no more than the speaker 's own paranoid fantasies.) <p> Warning humans off visiting their Antipodean regions, as Lovecraft and Pynchon both do, may seem a sensible strategy -- Coleridge, after all, once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Centre to live in the Circumference " -- but what of the psyche/globe whose fate is to have its poles invade its central regions? Here we see the polar quest diverging into two distinct types of journeys cure inner experience : going to the Pole and falling into the mundus subterraneus on one hand or, on the other, having the Poles invade the Ekumene, the center of consciousness, in such a way that the ego experiences either demonic conversion( death or psychosis) or a blissful mystical experience. <p> Using the macro-micro polar topos for very different purposes, two British writers, Leonora Carrington and Anna Kavan, employ this second type of mystic journey by sending the ice to their protagonists instead of the other way around. This inversion of the polar ice caps amounts to a translation of the psyche/globe into a transcendent Platonic form that delivers Eden or death, and in both works the globe paradoxically reaches its Burnetian regularized perfection by virtue of the solid sheath of ice encasing it.( The reverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unbearable heat -- informs J. G. Ballard 's 1963 novel The Drowned World.) <p> In Ice( 1967), by Anna Kayan( a name its bearer adopted in homage to Kafka), massive glaciers relentlessly encroach on Earth 's temperate zones, possibly as an unexpected result of nuclear testing. Kavan 's main character is an embodied Coleridgean Life-in-Death -- a nameless albino young woman with snowy white hair and skin transparent as glass who moves from one landscape of sadism to another in a world that is dying of frost. The " girl 's " mute passivity, we are told, is the result of being bullied by a sadistic mother( as Kayan herself claimed to have been). The male narrator, symbiotic alter ego of the brutal men to whom this woman is in thrall, pursues her through one vaguely totalitarian state after another in a phantasmagoric narrative in which points of view and lines of narrative are constantly shifting. In simultaneous parallel stories, the brutalized girl is resurrected from death and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a rollercoaster ride to death. <p> Kavan 's bleak millennial vision communicates powerful excitement about the coming Armageddon. The destruction of life is represented as an enthralling, highly dynamic process : <p> Dazzling ice stars bombarded the earth with rays, which splintered and penetrated the earth, filling earth 's core with their deadly coolness, reinforcing the cold of the advancing ice. And always, on the surface, the indestructible ice-mass was moving forward, implacably destroying all life. <p> The Earth Kavan is describing is a Burnetian sphere, of course ; even allowing such an event as " ice stars " pelting the planet with their freezing rays, it would be impossible, in real world terms, for ice to penetrate the Earth 's core and freeze it from the inside out. Rather, Kavan is giving us a pathetic fallacy description of a seductive, welcomed, apocalyptic death taking place at the center of one person 's soul and physical body as well as in the outside world : <p> Frozen by the deathly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crystalline ice-light, she felt herself becoming part of the polar vision, her structure becoming one with the structure of ice and snow. As her fate, she accepted the world of ice, shining, shimmering, dead ; she resigned herself to the triumph of glaciers and the death of her world. Addicted to heroin, Kavan died of its effects in 1968, age sixty-seven. One may draw the obvious parallels between the street name for heroin, the novel 's title, and the destruction of the world represented within it. The world and the woman are the same entity ; the body of the planet is her body ; man 's sadistic misuse of both has resulted in their deaths. Perversely, this is also an erotic fulfillment. <p> Leonora Carrington 's shifting polar caps in The Hearing Trumpet( 1977) provide a millennial vision as playful and life expanding as Anna Kavan 's are death dealing. Carrington, an English painter whose fiction and art have not received the recognition owed them in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which an elderly expatriate in Mexico, Marion Leatherby, is consigned by her son to a peculiar old folks ' home( whose quirky buildings serve as an expressionistic extension of the inhabitants ' own psyches) run by a Gurdjieffian tyrant. In the course of the entirely unsummarizable plot, Marion and the other old ladies, organized by their secret leader the black servant Christabel, stage a personal revolt, with the macrocosmic result of their invocation of a three-headed Goddess being nothing less than the exchange of the poles with the equator and the release of a winged hermaphrodite called the Sephira( a syncretic version of Isaiah 's six-winged seraph, here the result of the union of the Devil with a priestess of the old religion disguised as a nun) from the tower of our heroine 's own psyche. In such a cataclysmic manner -- as wolves and glaciers joyously invade the tropics -- is Marion 's initial forlorn wish to visit Lapland triumphantly fulfilled. <p> Very much in the spirit of Erasmus Darwin 's eccentric vision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows the protagonist of this psychic navigation to avoid the perils of both the overwhelmed consciousness( as represented by Poe, Lovecraft, and Kavan) and the colonizing consciousness( as represented by Lem). Here the invasion of consciousness by the remote and rejected regions of the psyche creates an icy Eden instead of Lovecraft 's and Kavan 's icy Hell. Marion Leatherby stands still while the Poles( herself, or her Self, the innermost core of her being, representing the true Pole) rise to meet consciousness in an ultimately benevolent encounter. At the climax Marion descends into a mundus subterraneus below the old folks ' home where she dies and -- after an alchemical cooking in a bubbling cauldron/rotundum stirred by her alter ego -- is reborn a greatly enlarged human. This death and rebirth represent the correct outcome of the alchemical work : the mystic unio which results in the shrinking of the Terra Incognita and corresponding enlargement of the " inhabited areas " of the psyche. Self, globe, and cosmos are realigned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, consciousness and unconsciousness. <p> After Carrington and Kavan, do any more polar literary icicles remain to be harvested? Quite a few, in fact, though with one exception they can not be covered here. Though its narrative framework is one of more straightforward realism, the same strands of thinking are visible in a short vignette in William Golding 's trilogy about a converted British warship on its perilous voyage through the South Ocean. In Fire Down Below( 1989), the concluding volume of this underrated masterpiece -- misread by reviewers as, among other things, a " great sentimental journey of the naval kind " -- the motley flock of passengers are Gnostic scintillae Dei whose microcosmically flickering souls resonate with the smoldering keelson in the bowels of the ship that threatens to rend apart at any moment. At one point before the ship reaches safe harbor in Australia, a calving, spinning iceberg( whose " dull and fitful gleam " the narrator first mistakes for the dawn) manifests as an enormous " cliff " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossibly, rotates around it. As, in another optical illusion, the berg seems to rush past the ship instead of the other way around, the narrator tells us he " saw a melange of visions in the ice which swept past me -- figures trapped in the ice, my father among them. " Golding 's ship of self has had a quick brush with the capricious Polar Spirit, who obligingly offers the ego/narrator a tantalizingly quick glimpse into the Narcissus pool orbis own unconscious. <p> The notion of psychological projection, our secularized humancentered construction of the old trope of sympathetic correspondences, now insists that the macrocosm reflects the microcosm instead of the other way around -- a development some of the old Renaissance heretics might well have applauded, since it locates the divine squarely within the human. In these terms, then, the inner wastes of Antarctica have provided a beautifully blank projective screen for post-Enlightenment writers and poets. Out of the Symmes Hole of their imaginations have crawled -- among other creatures -- the Polar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, a huge magnet, snail-like monsters and their star-headed masters, an enormous baby, a winged hermaphrodite, a victimized albino woman, and a multicolored monkey. <p> In Ice, his admirable study of the Antarctic, Stephen J. Pyne claims that now, at the close of the twentieth century, the era of the polar Gothic has also ended : " Once Antarctica and the ocean basins had been generally explored, there were no unvisited geographies within which to set a lost civilization ; fantasy writing had to resurrect old problems, tour other planets, or plunge into the depths of the human soul. " But even as we see this projective mechanism working in a novel like Solaris, it seems likely that our mapped, explored, satellite circumnavigated and much photographed Whole Earth will continue to exert its macrocosmic seductions on the human psyche. Robert Fludd would not find much to quarrel with in the present-day construct of the ecological food chain, a telluric-projected revival of the old cosmogony 's catena aurea, nor in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antarctica, widely believed in our age to leave humans nakedly exposed to malign ultraviolet radii from the heavens, is another perfect replication of Ptolemaic cosmology( Fig. 7). Empirically verifiable it may certainly be, but the polar hole is also a venerable construct of Western culture. <p> Popular storytelling continues to feed this symbolically rendered need. The two Hollywood film versions of The Thing, set in the Arctic and Antarctic respectively, belong to the category of the Other who emerges from the Pole, the desert, under the sea, and all other regions of inner wilderness outside the realm of consciousness. The 1956 Mole People, in which albino descendants of the Sumerians are discovered under a volcano, features a " scientific " introduction by Hollywood 's favorite professor Frank Baxter, who cheerfully cites Symmes and other worthies in defense of a hollow earth. In Peter Weir 's The Last Wave( 1978), Australian aborigines foretell in their dreams the next great Flood, a cataclysm produced by " giant low pressure from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Langoliers( 1994) features a planeload of people who leave sublunary space and time when they fly through a polar aurora borealis that mysteriously appears in the Midwestern skies ; Kevin Reynolds 's Waterworld( 1995) depicts an Earth in which the ice caps melt and the poles reverse to produce a lawless anti-Edenic oceanic planet. And this year will see the publication of a new blockbuster adventure novel, Subterranean, by James Clemens, " about a group of adventurers who travel to the underground center of Antarctica. " <p> In these formulaic narratives, the level of the inner psychological journey remains submerged and unconscious, though we sense intuitively that it is there, just as when as a child I felt the click of the uniting continents. A catharsis of this sort stays locked in reflexive instinct, lacking the fullness of discovery that a completely realized work of art allows. Yet humans never cease in their efforts to bring about the impossible union. The pull we feel the Polar Spirit exerting on us to go to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us, of course. Although Antarctica continues to be earnestly depicted in documentaries and news reports as " a continent devoted to science, " its less allowable representations flourish in a different territory of the human psyche, a region where we have never stopped trying to tow the Poles into our temperate zones. <p> Because if the old woman ca n't go to Lapland it means that Lapland must come to the old woman. <p> PHOTO( BLACK &; WHITE) : Tenniel 's illustration of the anti-Beetonian household. <p> PHOTO( BLACK &; WHITE) : Fig. 1.
