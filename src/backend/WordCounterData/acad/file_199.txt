4089141 Last academic year, I was excited to begin studying for my Master of Fine Arts in nonfiction writing at Big Name School. I had gotten my first MFA from Middle Name School at too early an age, and I, now more mature and exploding with ideas, was ready to start what I considered my " adult MFA. " I bought notebooks, brought my clip file up to date, and envisioned all the networking opportunities my would-be professors were sure to provide. Only one obstacle stood in my path : the big, fat rejection letter I received. </p> Rather than sulk( OK, I might have made mudslides and watched Beaches the night the letter arrived), I decided to spin my situation. I did n't need a fancy school -- or any school, for that matter. I could design my own makeshift MFA program geared toward exactly what I wanted to accomplish. And, best of all, I could enroll myself on the spot -- no application fee required. Turns out I 'd have a use for those notebooks after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled them with the draft of my first book. </p> There are any number of reasons why someone who wants to pursue an MFA does n't make it to the classroom : monetary concerns, time constraints, familial commitments, geographic location, and say-it-ain't-so rejection are but a handful. Whatever the circumstances, designing a self-guided program can, in many cases, bring the same end results : a marketable thesis and an iPhone full of contacts. Here are five steps eager writers can take to navigate their way : </p> 1 Define your goal. Ask yourself why an MFA program interests you. Most likely, you want to produce a book-length manuscript, so let 's take that as a given. Identifying what else you want to gain will enable you to work toward an end result that meets your personal needs. " Do you want to go into advertising or marketing? Journalism? " asks Brian McMillan, a journalist and 2009 graduate of Northern Michigan University 's MFA program. " The answers to those questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such advice holds true for do-it-yourself MFAs as well. </p> Though such a task might seem overwhelming, an easy way to fine-tune your thinking is to create a list. Jot the top five benefits that come to mind on a sheet of paper. Mull them over. Look at them from different angles. Decide which appeals to you most. And do n't hesitate to select more than one objective if a couple strike your fancy. </p> 2 Research existing MFA programs. Take advantage of the legwork other institutions put into planning their programs by adapting elements that scream " I 'm appealing! Consider me! " Look at traditional and low-residency programs, as well as different genres -- even those outside your focus. Your bible will be The AWP Official Guide to Writing Programs( http : //guide.awpwriter.org), which offers a comprehensive database of national and international undergraduate and graduate writing programs. </p> As you research, take note of what interests you -- craft courses, literature courses, workshops -- as well as what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of Arizona 's creative-writing MFA program, thought writing was more important to her development than literature study and chose her program accordingly. " Some MFA programs are overly academic, " Wangsness explains, " and as someone who wanted to focus exclusively on craft, these programs were not the right fit. " Understanding her interests before delving into a program helped guide her successful experience. </p> 3 Outline your semesters. Creating your own program allows you to focus on your growth as a writer ; the key is finding a workable approach. Generally, any training and literature activities should take place in the first part of your studies with heavy writing bringing up the rear.( While you can and should discipline yourself to write from day one, absorbing lessons early on will only strengthen that writing.) Consider how-to guides-such as The Portable MFA in Creative Writing from the New York Writers Workshop or Anne Lamott 's Bird by Bird, both of which offer instruction and advice -- in addition to works you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limitless. " You might try something like Stephen King suggests in his excellent On Writing " McMillan recommends. " He says to read and write for four to six hours per day.... That sounds impossible for someone with a job and a family, to squeeze six hours per day into their schedules. But the closer you can get to that, the better. " Though King talks specifically about novelists, the approach translates to any genre. </p> Evart, Mich., resident Axie Barclay chose a more structured technique. As an alternative to an MFA, which she considered too costly and time-consuming, the dairy worker and freelance writer embarked on " ambitious projects of reading and writing, consuming copious amounts of literature, and trying to write a poem or flash-fiction piece daily. " As a motivated, self-taught student, she noted that " making my own curriculum, so to speak, was fairly easy. " </p> Whatever your approach, I recommend a two-semester syllabus, like I used, to create measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not suit everyone -- and that 's OK. Make your program bend and shape around you. </p> 4 Humanize your program. Students in traditional MFA programs have a built-in audience for readings, brainstorming sessions, and general industry chatter. With a little imagination, do-it-yourselfers can create similar opportunities for themselves -- or, according to Matt Stewart, author of the novel The French Revolution, perhaps even better ones. Stewart, who was already disciplined enough to write every day before getting rejected from 11 MFA programs, takes advantage of his surroundings. " I 'm fortunate to live in San Francisco, " he says, " which is overflowing with terrific literary events -- it can be very distracting, actually-and a sincere, supportive community that rolls out the red carpet for newbie writers. I ca n't imagine how an MFA program could improve on this. " </p> Freelance writer Lisa Sinicki, who decided against the MFA route because of time and finances, has found similar success in engaging with like-minded peers. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer conferences, taken an in-person local class as well as online courses, and joined a writing group. " I 've tried to seek out the best teachers I can, and have selected programs based on what I feel is the next thing I need to improve my writing, " she says, noting that her commitment has paid off in the form of published work. She asks other writers for recommendations and, when she finds a teacher she likes, extends the relationship via private coaching. </p> Additionally, many schools hold public lectures, panels and talks that are free or low-cost. Audience members are frequently able to ask questions and mingle with speakers at these events. Come with a notebook and inquiries. </p> 5 Market your thesis. So you 've finished your program and have a nice, shiny manuscript. Congratulations! But what 's that -- the publishing world is n't exactly reaching out to grab what you know is the next New York Times bestseller, namely your book? Bummer. While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path, an attention-grabbing approach might be more advantageous in today 's climate.( To those who think " gimmicky " diminishes the value of the work, I ask : Would you rather be the published author who used a gimmick or the unpublished author who did n't?) </p> Stewart knows this firsthand. He looked at popular culture for inspiration to sell The French Revolution and began sharing snippets of his work via Twitter, a practice that gained traction and got him a deal with Soft Skull Press. " As a nobody, it was critical for me to build some literary street cred by getting into bookstores and landing reviews, " he notes. " Alas, it 's still really hard to pull that off without a traditional publisher. I think that 'll change, but until it does, I 'd encourage writers to find new ways to attract agents and publishers -- whether that 's through technology or building a platform through easy-to-hit channels( church, veterans groups, professional societies) or something nobody 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let rejection slow you down. </p> Getting a traditional MFA is not without its merits( hello, diploma as wall art!), but it also is n't a guaranteed gateway to fame and fortune. To some, it even borders on extravagant. " An MFA degree is not something I would ever recommend someone go into debt for, because in the end, it 's a luxury, " says John Temple, a journalism teacher at West Virginia University who polished Deadhouse : Life in a Coroner 's Office while studying for his MFA at the University of Pittsburgh. " There are other ways to learn to write. " </p> Indeed, there are. Published authors come from myriad training backgrounds, but they share a mixture of skills and commitment. Writers do n't need an MFA to be good at their craft, nor will an MFA -- traditional or self-guided -- fix discipline problems. But if they want it badly, they 'll make it happen. " There 's nothing like balancing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life, and writing to get a lot more efficient at everything, " Stewart muses. </p> When writers are ready to make a commitment to their craft, developing their own program allows them to eschew a predetermined agenda and keep their own best interests in mind. Now if only a thick skin came standard. </p> By Rachel Eddey </p> Rachel Eddey, whose credits include The New York limes and Newsday, is a writer and researcher at the Big Name School that denied her MFA candidacy.
