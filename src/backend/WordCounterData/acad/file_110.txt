4016441 In this article, we examine the predictive power of selected social and academic variables regarding arrest frequency for 11th-grade boys who 7 years earlier had been judged to be at risk for developing antisocial behavior patterns. Multiple regression analyses indicated that( a) measures of academic and social skills that reflected more skilled and positive profiles were associated with participants ' exhibiting less frequent and less severe forms of antisocial behavior, as shown by arrest records at 11th grade, and( b) antisocial measures on which participants scored higher were associated with more frequent arrests for more serious offenses in Grade 11. We also conducted an analysis of the residuals to study those persons and their characteristics who were misclassified by the predictive model. Implications of these results for future research and intervention, particularly within the context of schooling, are discussed. <p> In the field of emotional and behavioral disorders, one of the most important -- and difficult -- research issues concerns the accurate prediction of individuals ' future antisocial acts based on past and current knowledge of those persons and their behavioral characteristics( Fartington &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is arrest status, which is routinely used as a proxy variable for antisocial risk status in spite of the vagaries and inconsistencies inherent within the legal system and its accommodation of at risk youth( e.g., Henggler, 1989 ; Hindelang, Hirschi, &; Weis, 1979 ; Patterson, 1982). The general public and governing officials place considerable weight on the importance of arrest status as a social status indicator( Farrington &; Tarling, 1985). The ability to accurately predict if an individual will be arrested in the future is an important outcome of research efforts. If a stable set of predictor variables that account for antisocial behavior at some later point in time could be isolated, it theoretically would be possible to( a) identify at an early stage those individuals who are likely to engage in severe antisocial acts in the future and( b) prevent these acts by applying comprehensive supports and services that addressed the at-risk persons ' unique needs( Kazdin, 1987). <p> Such a research emphasis is critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collective impact on the processes and outcomes of schooling. In recent years, the general public has expressed great concern over the escalating incidence of arrests among U.S. adolescents. A recent national survey( Elam, Rose, &; Gallup, 1994) suggested that citizens in our country are very concerned about( a) the perpetration of antisocial, aggressive acts toward other students and school professionals and( b) the capacity of schools to address these growing problems( Walker &; Gresham, 1997). School violence has emerged as a major societal concern in recent years due to the egregious violent acts that have been committed on school grounds and the public 's emerging awareness of just how vulnerable school settings are to criminal activity by students and others( Flannery, 1997 ; Gottfredson, 1997 ; Walker, Colvin, &; Ramsey, 1995). <p> Currently, the public school systems are being required to expand the range and number of services to an ever-increasing spectrum of adolescents who manifest, or are at risk for, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kauffman, Lloyd, Baker, &; Riedel, 1995). Numerous studies documented the importance of family and societal risk factors associated with the development of antisocial behavior patterns among adolescents( Kazdin, 1987 ; Loeber, 1982 ; Loeber &; Stouthamer-Loeber, 1998 ; Patterson, Reid, &; Dishion, 1992 ; Robins, &; Rutter, 1990). One notable characteristic of promising intervention programs for this population is location within the school setting where at-risk children and youth are accessible and intervention resources can be concentrated to address their needs( Dryfoos, 1990, 1993). For many young people, school is one of the most stable experiences in their lives, with the potential to provide important academic and social services( Walker &; Bullis, 1995). Given the dismal record of the great majority of interventions for at-risk adolescents( Kazdin, 1987 ; Reid, 1993), it seems clear that programs for this population must address family, social, and school-related variables if they are to demonstrate positive effects. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressing the problems of antisocial behavior, delinquency, and violence among at-risk youth ; however, because these social problems are now impinging intensely upon school settings, such detachment is no longer tenable. One of our long-term goals is to assist schools and educators in taking a leadership role in addressing these problems and using the context of schooling to divert at-risk children and youth from paths that too often inexorably lead to unfortunate outcomes. The school setting, for example, provides an ideal environment for hosting and coordinating comprehensive intervention approaches -- such as partnerships among the school staff, families, and community agencies -- that can be effective with this population. <p> The purpose of this article is to describe a longitudinal study focused on predicting the arrest status of a selected subsample of adolescents judged to be at risk for engaging in antisocial behavior from data gathered primarily within the school setting. In collaboration with Patterson and his associates at the Oregon Social Learning Center( OSLC ; Patterson, 1983 ; Patterson &; Bank, 1986, 1989 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, we have been involved in a long-term longitudinal study of two samples of adolescent males who displayed differing levels of risk status( severe versus mild) for antisocial behavior patterns at the point of their selection into the study, which was elementary-school age( Walker, Shinn, O'Neill, &; Ramsey, 1987). Both groups were drawn from a larger study conducted by Patterson( 1983) and his associates as part of a long-term( from age 8 to adulthood) investigation into the correlates and longitudinal stability of antisocial behavior patterns( the Patterson Oregon Youth Study OYS). From this point forward, we refer to these participants as the Walker subsample. <p> In this article, we discuss the testing of the power of a model composed of selected variables in predicting the arrest status over a 7-year follow-up period of the Walker subsample participants. The predicted criterion was a scalar outcome variable of antisocial behavior -- ranging from the complete absence of antisocial behavior to differing levels of antisocial behavior -- as reflected by the frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We also examined cases in which persons were misclassified( i.e., an individual was predicted to have an antisocial profile at 11th grade but did not have such a profile) to increase our knowledge of the intricacies and dynamics of the prediction model. METHOD <p> In this section we describe the( a) sample recruitment and selection procedures used for the Patterson( 1983) OYS at-risk sample( N = 206) and for the Walker subsample( n = 80),( b) longitudinal design,( c) data collection procedures, and( d) subgroups of the Walker subsample that were compared on the outcome constructs and the analyses used for this purpose. Sample Recruitment and Selection Procedures for the OYS <p> A cohort-sequential design( Baltes, 1968) was used to structure the longitudinal tracking and data collection procedures for the Patterson OYS. At the present time, the OYS longitudinal investigation is continuing with funding from the National Institute of Mental Health. Participants are now entering adulthood, and the community adjustment experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g., Patterson et al., 1992). <p> Three school districts in the metropolitan area of Eugene-Springfield, Oregon, a medium-size suburban community with a population of approximately 250,000, agreed to participate in the OYS. The purpose of the initial recruitment effort was to identify and include boys with elevated risk factors for antisocial behavior who therefore theoretically were at risk for developing antisocial behavior patterns. This sample thus was not representative of the community at large ; however, in terms of demographics such as race, ethnicity, and SES levels, the sample did appear to be representative. <p> Juvenile court data were used to establish the frequency of delinquent episodes reported by the police for the community, and the incidence of juvenile crime was calculated for the neighborhoods serving each of the 43 elementary schools within the three school districts. The 15 schools located in the areas with the highest incidence of crime were chosen as target schools for recruitment into the Patterson OYS study. In the first year of the study, 14 schools agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then randomly ordered, and the first 6 schools were recruited.( Only 6 of the 15 schools were needed because the recruitment rate was higher than expected). In the second year of the study, this selection process was repeated and 7 targeted schools were recruited. <p> In each of the 2 years in which we recruited participants, all families with boys in fourth grade at the selected schools were invited to participate in the OYS study. Of these, 31 families were deemed ineligible because they spoke a language other than English or were planning to move out of state within the next 6 months. Of the remaining 277 families in the pool, 206( 74.4%) agreed to participate in the study. The first cohort( n - 102) was recruited in the 1983-1984 school year ; the second cohort( n = 104) was recruited in the 19841985 school year. Statistical analysis revealed similarity between the cohorts on all demographic variables : the families were primarily lower income( more than 20% of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families received welfare) and almost all were White, which reflects the community 's demographics. Walker Subsample Recruitment and Selection <p> Since 1984, we have studied a subsample of 80 participants drawn from the larger OYS sample. The purpose was to focus on the educational performance of at-risk males in conjunction with the rich data set provided by the OYS sample. Because limited resources precluded inclusion of the entire OYS sample in this research effort, we chose a subsample representing two levels of risk for developing antisocial behavior patterns : mild and severe( Walker, 1984). Participants were selected from each of the two OYS cohorts and divided into either antisocial or at-risk control groups based upon their scores on( a) an antisocial construct developed by the Oregon Social Learning Center that was composed of a weighted combination of measures constructed from home observations, child and teacher interviews, and peer nominations, and( b) aggression subscale scores from the Child Behavior Checklist( CBCL ; Achenbach &; Edelbrock, 1991) and the Teacher Report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CBCL assigned by parents and teachers. <p> Parent and teacher ratings were critical in determining the antisocial and at-risk control groups in the subsample and also were key components of the antisocial construct scores used in the participant selection process. The CBCL and TRF are well-researched instruments demonstrating( a) more than adequate test-retest reliabilities,( b) highly statistically significant correlations with observational ratings of child problem behavior, and( c) powerful discriminant validity, with the ability to discriminate between children with and without emotional disorders, diagnostic subgroups of children who have emotional or behavioral disturbances, and students in general education classes from those in special education classes( Edelbrock, 1988). <p> The antisocial group within the Walker subsample consisted of 39 individuals. Out of the total sample of 206, members of this group ranked highest on the antisocial construct score, and their parent and teacher aggression subscale scores from the CBCL were 1 standard deviation or more above the mean of the national standardization sample for this instrument. A table of random @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( n = 41) from the remaining pool of approximately 160 subjects. Extensive descriptions of the backgrounds and characteristics of these study participants can be found in Walker et al.( 1987). No consistent differences were evident in the demographic data for ethnicity and parental income for the two subsamples( Walker et al., 1987). The current sample size of 76 represents 95% of the original sample. The four participants no longer in the study either moved or declined further participation. Longitudinal Design and Data Collection Schedule <p> OYS study participants are assessed repeatedly over time on an array of variables measuring( a) personal adjustment and attitudes,( b) family dynamics,( c) parenting practices, and( d) outcomes such as drug use, arrests, school performance, and affiliation with antisocial peers. Measures are recorded annually. Complete assessments are done every other year, and partial assessments are done during the intervening years. Each year 's assessments and resulting data are referred to as a " data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Patterson et al., 1992). The data for this study were drawn from these procedures and measures. Constructs and Measures <p> Seminal work on the development and validation of global construct scores for assessing the status of antisocial populations has been carried out by Patterson and his associates( see Capaldi &; Patterson, 1989 ; Patterson &; Bank, 1986, 1989). As part of their ongoing research, Patterson and his colleagues developed a series of highly sensitive construct scores to describe the OYS study participants and their caregivers. These construct scores( a) are multi-agent, multi-method, and/or multi-setting in nature ;( b) have excellent psychometric characteristics ; and( c) are highly predictive of important outcomes in child and youth development over a number of years( Walker, Irvin, Noell, &; Singer, 1992). Descriptions of the construct scores used in this study -- as well as in the OYS project -- and their development and validation are described and illustrated in Capaldi and Patterson( 1989). @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also evidence considerable validity in predicting long-term outcomes of social importance( e.g., arrest status, drug use, school dropout). Capaldi and Patterson standardized all constructs to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. <p> Six construct scores measured at different data collection waves in the OYS longitudinal study, and a social skills rating by teachers, were considered in the initial pool of predictor variables for this study. The means, standard deviations, and sample sizes for these variables at different data collection waves -- and their correlations with the criterion variable -- are presented in Table 1. Brief descriptions of the constructs used in the current study and of the social skills rating scale follow. <p> Child Antisocial Construct. This construct was based on numerous scales( including Morn, Dad, Teacher, Parent, and Child Reports on the Child Overt and Covert Antisocial measures), a single score indicator from the Parent Report, and two single-item indicators : " How often child exerts negative influence on friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " Items with an item-total correlation of less than.2 were excluded. Many of the items had low variance, which was expected, given the nature of the Antisocial construct. Items with variance less than.2 were not excluded for this reason. Variables were computed for the scale by taking the mean, given that 60% or more of the items in that scale were present. <p> Academic Skills. Four indicators were developed to assess the Academic Skills construct. These were CBCLs completed by the teacher and parent(s), the Wide Range Achievement Test( WRAT-3 ; Wilkinson, 1983) and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test( PPVT ; Dunn &; Dunn, 1981) administered at OSLC, and standardized scholastic tests administered once a year at the student 's school. These indicators focused mainly on the student 's skills in math, reading, spelling, and language arts. The Academic Skills construct has high internal validity, with all indicators loading on a single factor. <p> Examples of items from the CBCL-Parent included in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) Is child in a special class? and( #7:4) Has child ever repeated a grade? Items from the CBCL-Teacher included( #5) Has child been referred for special class? and( #6) Has child repeated a grade? The WRAT( reading achievement test) and PPVT were administered at the child interview. Scholastic achievement tests included Reading, Spelling, Language Arts, and Math. <p> Item analyses were computed on each of these measures. Items with an item-total correlation of less than.2 were excluded. Items with a variance of less than 20% were also excluded. Variables were computed for the scale by taking the mean whenever 60% or more of the items in that scale were not missing. The PPVT was dropped from the analysis because it is not an academic achievement test, but rather an IQ test. The child skill items were also eliminated so that they might be used as an indicator of child self-esteem. <p> Antisocial Behavior. A diverse array of variables was included and analyzed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the CBCL, telephone interviews, and teachers ' self-reports about the student 's behavior patterns. Examples of representative items are as follows : CBCL-Parent : Overt Antisocial( #3) Argues a lot( #22) Disobedient at home( #90) Swearing or obscene language CBCL-Parent : Covert Antisocial( #20) Destroys his own things( #81) Steals at home( #101) Truancy, skips school CBCL-Teacher : Overt Antisocial( #3) Argues a lot( #23) Disobedient at school CBCL-Teacher : Covert Antisocial( #20) Destroys his own things( #82) Steals( #101) Unexplained absences Child Telephone Interview : Overt Antisocial( e.g., In the last 24 hours, did you :)( #15) Argue with an adult?( #20) Tease anyone?( #22) Hit siblings? Child Telephone Interview : Covert Antisocial( e.g., In the last 3 days did you :)( #24) Tell a lie?( #25) Get in trouble at school? Teacher( #11) How often does he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( #21) How likely is it that the student will have future police trouble?( #22) Target child has tattoos <p> Delinquency. Variables used in deriving this construct score included both the Major Index Scale( Giordano &; Cernkovich, 1979) and the Elliott Self-Report Delinquency Scale( Elliott, 1983). Sample items included Major Offenses Scale( #5) Stole motor vehicle( #20) Sexual assault( #27) Sold hard drugs Minor Offenses Scale( #1) Damaged family property( #8) Arson( #41) Obscene calls Number of Arrests During the Wave <p> Substance Use. Sample items from variables used in this construct included Boy 's Substance Use( #1) Has he used tobacco( #3) Has he used beer or wine( #316) Behavior suggests he is trying drugs Peer Task Coder Impressions( #34) TC referred to alcohol use( #36) TC referred to marijuana use Child Interview : Substance Consumption( #36) When drinking, do you usually get high?( #37) How high? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) Child uses drugs, alcohol CBCL-Parent( #105) Child uses drugs, alcohol Parent Telephone Interview Child Telephone Interview <p> Items with an item-total correlation of less than.2 were excluded. Due to the nature of this particular construct, inclusion of low base-rate items was considered important. Items with a variance of less than 20% were not excluded for that reason. As before, variables were computed for the scale by taking the mean whenever 60% or more of the items in that scale were present. <p> Deviant Peer. The role of deviant peer affiliations in relation to boys ' antisocial behavior is of critical importance and has been discussed in detail elsewhere( Dishion, 1987 ; Patterson, et al., 1992). The Deviant Peer construct assessed peer-related behavior such as drug use and stealing, and it was defined by three indicators. Two of the indicators -- Parent Reports of Overt/ Covert Child Behavior and Peer Nominations -- consisted of a single item. The third indicator was the child 's report of friends ' substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this construct, with the indicators correlating in the.10 to.28 range. It was hypothesized that deviant peer groups are not strong for the 9- to 10-year-old age groups, but that the internal validity of the deviant peer construct increases as the boys enter adolescence. <p> Examples of variables used included CBCL-Parent( #39) Hangs around with children who get in trouble CBCL-Teacher( #39) Hangs around with others who get in trouble Parent OCA questionnaire( #29) Does he hang out with kids who steal? Child Interview : Substance Use( #16) Do you have friends your age who drink alcohol?( #16A) What do they drink?( #16B) Do they ever get drunk?( #16C) How often do your friends drink? Child Interview : Peer Behavior( e.g., During the last year, how many of your friends have :)( #1) Cheated on school tests?( #2) Ruined or damaged something on purpose that was n't theirs? Peer Nominations( #17) Kids who belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social Competence and School Adjustment. In addition to the measures administered and completed under the auspices of Patterson and his colleagues at OSLC, the Walker-McConnell Scale of Social Competence and School Adjustment( Walker &; McConnell, 1995) was completed on the Walker subsample by participants ' teachers in the fall of the fifth grade. The elementary-age version of the Walker-McConnell scale consists of 43 items relating to the social adjustment of children( Grades K-6) in school settings, which load on one of three factors. Factor 1, Teacher-Preferred Social Behavior, consists of 16 items relating to interacting with teachers( e.g., shows sympathy for others). Factor 2, Peer-Preferred Social Behavior, consists of 17 items relating to peer interactions( e.g., makes friends easily with other children). Factor 3, School Adjustment Behavior, consists of 10 items relating to teacher management of the classroom( e.g., attends to assigned task). All items are scored on a 5-point scale of frequency of occurrence, with total scores on each factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Walker-McConnell scale was developed over a five-year period and initially standardized with a sample of 762 cases ; the final standardization sample consisted of 1,800 cases. The scale has excellent internal consistency and interjudge reliability( indexes above.90 for all three factors) and discriminates powerfully between clinical and nonclinical samples across multiple validation studies. Prediction Model <p> Correlations and significance levels between the constructs and the criterion variable were highly statistically significant, and all but one of the correlations were in the " moderate " to " large " statistical effect sizes( Cohen, 1988). The directions of the associations were consistent with our initial theoretical suppositions, with constructs measuring antisocial behavior being correlated positively with the outcome variable and constructs measuring academic performance and social skills ratings being associated negatively with the outcome variable. That is, persons who scored high on the antisocial constructs tended to score higher on the outcome variable and persons who scored high on the Academic Skills constructs and Social Skills scale tended to score lower on the outcome variable. Outcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsample was used as the major criterion variable in this study. Data for this variable were derived from the official databases of police or court reports. Each report listed the date of the offense or court proceeding, date of disposition, the actual disposition, date of final disposition, and the final disposition. The possibility existed that multiple offenses had been listed from the same police or court report, thereby sharing the same dispositions and disposition dates. Also, multiple reports having different dispositions and disposition dates could have been made on the same date. A trained data collector assigned each offense a unique four-digit code based on the definition of offense codes used in the state court system. This assignment was direct and required little inference, thereby minimizing error. Additional offense variables were required when there were multiple charges stemming from one report. For example, if the date of offense, disposition date, and disposition were the same, the offense most often resulted in a different code for these multiple charges. A comprehensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records. <p> We established six levels for the outcome variable : 0 = no dispositions, 1= one minor disposition, 2 = one serious disposition, 3 = two serious dispositions, 4 = three serious dispositions, and 5 = four or more serious dispositions. However, dispositions were counted only if their severity score was greater than zero for purposes of compiling the outcome variable. Examples of typical minor dispositions include traffic offenses and minor found to be in possession of alcoholic beverage who was given probation. Examples of serious dispositions include resisting arrest, burglary, unauthorized use of motor vehicle, assault, and theft. A typical record for a participant from this database is provided in Table 2. Analyses <p> As noted previously, a total of 76 participants from the original Walker subsample of 80 subjects were included in the analyses for this study. We first computed a series of univariate Pearson product-moment correlations between the construct scores at the different data collection waves and the scalar criterion. We then used a stepwise multiple-regression procedure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their association with the outcome variable to create a predictor model( Cohen &; Cohen, 1983). That is, the predictor variable that had the strongest statistical association with the outcome variable was selected into the prediction model first ; the second strongest predictor variable was then added into the model, and so forth. Variables that were not added to the model were those variables where the explanatory variance on the outcome criterion ceased to be statistically significant at the.05 alpha level, as determined by an F test for the multiple-regression procedure. <p> Following the recommendations of Cohen and Cohen( 1983), we identified " outliers " -- participants who scored roughly 3 or more standard deviations above or below the standardized mean of the outcome variable. We did this to gain a greater understanding of the nuances of the predictor model and to pinpoint where in the prediction process the model failed. We correlated the residuals with the variables included in the predictor model and the criterion variable, and we then examined each outlier case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are presented in Table 3. The final model contained five predictor variables that exhibited an R2 value of.803 and a multiple R value of.896. This result is considered to be a large statistical effect, according to Cohen 's magnitude criteria( Cohen, 1988). To adjust the initial R2 value for chance fluctuations in the analysis, we applied a shrinkage formula suggested by Cohen and Cohen( 1983). This formula yielded a " shrunken " R2 value of.786 and a shrunken R of.887. Even with the application of this conservative statistical procedure, the resulting relationship would be considered a large statistical effect( Cohen, 1988). <p> The first, and strongest, variable in the model was the Deviant Peer construct as measured at Data Collection Wave 4, which was roughly 3 years after the inception of the study. The next two variables included in the model were the Delinquency construct and the Antisocial Behavior construct, both collected at Data Collection Wave 6, which was approximately 5 years after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered into the model were the Peer and School subscale scores from the Walker-McConnell measure, which were collected at a single timepoint during the fifth-grade year for participants. Residual Analysis <p> The mean standardized predicted criterion score was.22( SD = 1.12, range = -2.11-3.73), and the mean standardized residual score was.09( SD = 1.36, range = -3.49-3.12). The correlations between the residual scores and the predictor variables are presented in Table 4. <p> Residual scores for the entire study sample are correlated with the five variables selected for the final prediction model. The residual scores were relatively uncorrelated with the predictor variables, confirming the close relationship of the final prediction model to the outcome criterion. The seven individuals who were identified as outliers are profiled in Table 5. Each individual 's scores on the variables included in the final prediction model are presented. <p> Three cases were overpredicted by the final regression model( i.e., it was thought that these persons would have more serious arrest records than they actually did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 49 would have a score of 2.9 on the outcome variable, but his score was 0, because he had no formal arrests on his record at the 11th grade. For this participant, the most important result was his relatively high scores( above the sample means for each factor) on the two Walker-McConnell subscales. For Case 56, the model predicted an extremely high level of antisocial behavior on the outcome variable( 7.4). Even though the model overpredicted this participant 's actual status( 5), this status represents the most extreme end of the outcome variable ; thus, the overprediction discrepancy may be attributed to a ceiling effect. Case 56 had exceptionally high scores on the antisocial variables in the model, a relatively high score on the Walker-McConnell Peer subscale( above the sample mean), and a low score on the Walker-McConnell School subscale( below the sample mean). The model predicted that Case 66 would score 4.3 on the outcome variable, but his actual score was 2. He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score on the Walker-McConnell School subscale( almost 3 standard deviations below the sample mean) but relatively high scores on the Walker-McConnell Peer subscale( above the sample mean). <p> The final regression model under predicted four cases( i.e., it was anticipated that these participants would present less extreme arrest records than they actually did). For Case 62, the model predicted a score of-.6 on the outcome variable( his actual score was 2). In this person 's profile the component that stands out is his relatively high score on the Antisocial Behavior construct at Data Collection Wave 6. Case 60 was predicted to score -.5 on the outcome variable but scored 2. His profile shows low scores on the three peer and antisocial factors and scores lower than the sample averages on the two Walker-McConnell subscales. Case 25 was predicted to score 2.6 and exhibited an actual score of 5. His performance on the Walker-McConnell Peer subscale was lower than the sample mean, and his score on the Walker-McConnell School subscale was much lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the sample mean). Finally, the model predicted a score of 2.7 on the outcome variable for Case 4, but his actual score was 5. This participant had an elevated score on the Antisocial Behavior construct and a low score on the Walker-McConnell School subscale( 1 standard deviation below the sample mean). DISCUSSION <p> This study was conducted in the Pacific Northwest with a small group of predominantly White participants ; thus, the external validity of the results may be limited to this geographic area and this population. Two other points also should be noted : The study was correlational in design, and the results should not be construed as causal in nature ; The outcome variable was based on formal arrest records, which may underestimate the actual rate of antisocial and/or criminal acts within this sample because only a small number of acts for which an individual could be arrested actually come to the attention of the authorities and are formally addressed by the legal system( Hindelang et al., 1979). <p> Clearly, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding generalization of its results to other settings and populations. On the other hand, the care taken in choosing the sample, the comprehensive and carefully constructed measures used, and the high response rates evident in the longitudinal data-collection process provide ample support for the internal validity of the findings( Capaldi &; Patterson, 1989 ; Patterson et al., 1992). Findings <p> The predictive power of the first variable in the model, association with deviant peers in Grade 8, is somewhat startling and by itself accounts for almost 57% of the variance in the outcome variable of arrest status at Grade 11. This relationship is even more impressive given that data for the outcome variable were collected 3 years after this particular predictor variable was assessed. The strong relationship existing between an individual 's having friends who engage in antisocial behavioral acts and that individual 's performance of similar acts has been well-documented through correlational procedures( Dishion, Loeber, Stouthamer-Loeber, &; Patterson, 1984) and is fully consistent with folk-wisdom handed down by generations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prediction model were Delinquency and Antisocial Behavior at Data Collection Wave 6. The inclusion of these constructs in the prediction model provided support for the interrelationship of different forms of antisocial behaviors( e.g., petty crime) and at-risk behaviors( e.g., use of obscene language, noncompliance with instructions of parent and authority figures ; Donovan &; Jessor, 1985) with more extreme forms of antisocial behavior, as reflected in formal arrest records. As these data were gathered at roughly the 8th-grade level, their relationship with more extreme forms of antisocial behavior in the 11th grade is indicative of a progressive, escalating pattern of deviant behavior occurring over the developmental continuum. This form of developmental psychopathology( from age-specific forms of aberrant behavior to socially unacceptable and/or dangerous actions) has been well documented in the literature as a way of conceptualizing and understanding these at-risk behaviors( e.g., Lewis &; Miller, 1990). <p> Finally, the last two variables in the model, the Walker-McConnell Peer and School subscale scores gathered during the fifth grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the outcome variable), suggest the importance of peer relationships and school performance in accounting for arrest status in the adolescent years. These findings are consistent with other findings in the literature regarding the correlation of social skills and peer acceptance during childhood with adjustment in later life( Parker &; Asher, 1987) and with the often-cited connection between academic skills and antisocial/criminal behavior exhibited in later life( Cornwall &; Bawden, 1992). <p> The descriptive profiles of the seven outlier cases provide an interesting profile of participants who did not perform as predicted. The extreme nature of the study sample, coupled with the absence of a comparison sample of persons who were not judged to be at risk, limits our ability to interpret these cases. Interpretation is also hampered by a lack of personal, in-depth knowledge of these persons. Rutter( 1988) recommended that in order to truly understand and make sense of antisocial behavior in individuals, empirical data derived from group studies must be combined with individual clinical observations and awareness. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for future research. First, the replication of this study in other settings and with samples composed of a higher percentage of persons representing cultural/ethnic minorities is essential for confirming the external validity of the results. Further, including comparison samples of peers judged not to be at risk for developing antisocial behavior patterns may help clarify interpretation of the profiles of the current at-risk participants. It would be interesting to examine association of the variables we selected as predictors with self-reports of antisocial behavior instead of formal arrest records. As mentioned earlier, these records reflect only a relatively small percentage of the antisocial acts performed by at-risk persons( Hindelang et al., 1979). It may well be that self-report of antisocial behavior could change the ordering of at-risk participants on a summary antisocial behavior variable( e.g., youth with less extreme arrest records may self-report more frequent episodes of antisocial behavior and of a more serious form) and lead to different associations of the predictor variables with such an outcome variable. Given the relative power of Peer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variable in this study, it would have been useful to have included these same measures, or similar school-based measures, in order to provide a more complete profile of the sample in the same way as their community and antisocial behaviors were described. If schools are to serve as sites for effective interventions with these types of students, the students ' school-based performance must be assessed and longitudinal data for them must be gathered and carefully studied( Rutter, 1988). <p> The impact of the timing of school-based delivery of interventions for antisocial students should also be studied. There is a common belief among practitioners and academicians that interventions for at-risk populations should begin as early as possible and continue over a number of years in order to demonstrate positive results( Zigler, Taussig, &; Black, 1992). However, most interventions for these groups, especially within school contexts, begin only when the individual " steps over " some legal, social, or educational line by exhibiting behavior beyond the accepted standard(s) of the organization(s) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as during middle or high school years), after these forms of behavior have become entrenched in cognitive and performance patterns, would have less powerful effects than interventions offered earlier in the developmental progression( Walker &; Bullis, 1995). Other evidence suggests that adolescence can be an appropriate point to intervene with at-risk individuals, however, because this is a time when many youth are ready and able to change( Albee, 1982 ; Hobbs &; Robinson, 1982 ; Kazdin, 1993). <p> We believe that interventions for the at-risk population often suffer from a lack of treatment fidelity, particularly when administered within school settings. That is, proven interventions are provided in ways that deviate from the manner in which they were originally developed and result in weaker applications( Kazdin, 1987). Any experimental study of these interventions should address treatment fidelity directly in a comprehensive measurement system in order to document implementation procedures when applied in " scaled up " versions of the intervention. <p> The association between antisocial peers and arrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points to the importance of pairing at-risk youth with peers who can model appropriate social behavior and, hopefully, shape and support them. Such mentoring/ affiliation programs could be focused on either school or peer-controlled contexts( Dryfoos, 1990) and, whenever possible, should include the family in monitoring the child 's associations with other children( Patterson, 1982). <p> As school is a primary socialization environment for children and youth, the impact of offering socializing experiences with typically developing peers through intensive learning experiences should be explored as well( Coie &; Krebiehl, 1984 ; Coie, Underwood, &; Lochman, 1991). Many well-designed and carefully developed interventions exist and would have substantial applicability for meeting both the social-behavioral and academic instructional needs of this population( e.g., Carnine &; Kameenui, 1992 ; Deshler &; Schumaker, 1986). In addition, at-risk students who are likely to become juvenile offenders are often in desperate need of( a) social skills training relative to the school context( Hazel, Schumaker, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, &; Greenwood, 1981) and( b) exposure to wraparound services provided by community agencies based in the school setting( e.g., Dryfoos, 1993 ; Epstein et al., 1993). The exact timing of these services, the way in which they are offered, the combination of services yielding the most positive effects, and their differential impact on subgroups of students( e.g., English speaking vs. English as a second language) should also be examined through research. <p> Greenwood, Model, Rydell, and Chiesa( 1996) analyzed the cost-effectiveness of different strategies in diverting at-risk youth from a life of crime. Their comparisons of( a) home visits and daycare,( b) parent training,( c) graduation incentives,( d) delinquent supervision, and( e) incarceration indicated that providing graduation incentives is clearly the most cost-effective in terms of preventing the commission of serious crimes by these youth. This finding highlights one of the key roles schools can play in responding effectively to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relatively dismal record of intervention outcomes achieved so far with this population, it seems clear that comprehensive school-based interventions should be coupled with family-oriented interventions and community-based wraparound programs in order to maximize the impact of such efforts( Kazdin, 1987 ; Reid, 1993). Just as school-based interventions alone will not have maximum positive impact for atrisk children and youth, interventions focused and delivered outside the school setting are likely to have a similar result. Interventions for this population must be as comprehensive and long-term as possible to achieve socially valid outcomes.
