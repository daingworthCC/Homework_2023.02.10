4088841 Alcohol use was studied in 158 adolescents with visual impairments and 537 sighted adolescents in Germany. The students with visual impairments reported lower levels of alcohol use and drunkenness, and between-group differences increased across adolescence. The lower alcohol use by students with visual impairments was explained, in part, by the lower peer group integration of these adolescents. </p> The prevalence of alcohol use increases sharply during adolescence, and at the end of adolescence, most persons in Western countries have consumed alcoholic beverages( O'Malley, Johnston, &; Bachman, 1998). For example, according to a study by the Federal Center for Health Education( 2007), German 12-17 year olds consumed, on average, 50.4 grams( 1.8 ounces) of alcohol per week. Whereas those aged 12-15 consumed, on average, 21.1 grams( 0.7 ounces) per week, those aged 16-17 consumed, on average, 104.6 grams( 3.7 ounces) per week. </p> Getting drunk and binge drinking are risky drinking behaviors that may impair adolescents ' health. According to the Federal Center for Health Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drunkenness, on average, at about 15.5 years. Binge drinking is usually defined as the consumption of at least four( for girls) or five( for boys) standard units of alcohol( Midanik, 1999), often with the intention of getting drunk. In a study by the Federal Center of Health Education( 2007), about 26% of German 12-17 year olds reported episodes of binge drinking during the previous month. Again, the percentage of binge drinkers increased from 12% among the 12-15 year olds to 51% among the 16-17 year olds. Hibell et al.( 2004) reported that 57% of German 15-16 year olds had a binge-drinking episode during the previous month. In that cross-national survey, the percentages of young binge drinkers varied from 15% in Turkey to 60% in Denmark. An early age of first drunkenness and episodes of binge drinking are known to be associated with an increased risk of a number of problems, including alcohol poisoning, alcohol dependence, road accidents, unwanted( teenage) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heeren, Winter, &; Wechsler, 2003 ; Stolle, Sack, &; Thomasius, 2009). </p> It is estimated that 1.4 million children aged 15 and younger worldwide have been blind for many years and that more than 12 million children aged 5-15 are visually impaired because of uncorrected refractive errors( World Health Organization, 2010). Whereas numerous studies have assessed the use of alcohol in general adolescent populations( see, for example, O'Malley et al., 1998), no research has investigated whether the pattern of alcohol use may differ between adolescents with visual impairments and sighted adolescents. </p> Some authors have suggested that visual impairment may lead to higher levels of substance use. For example, alcohol may be used to cope with the frustrations with the disability and low self-esteem and to gain social acceptance among peers( Koch, Nelipovich, &; Sneed, 2002). Thus, Nelipovich, Vergin, and Kossick( 1998) suggested that 20% to 30% of individuals with visual impairments may need treatment for problems related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( 1989) reported that 40% to 50% of adults with low vision or blindness may abuse alcohol. Nonetheless, Kooner, Albdoor, Cho, &; Adams-Huet( 2008) found no differences in the risk for alcohol abuse between adults who were blind and those who were sighted with primary open angle glaucoma, and Jones, Rovner, Crews, and Danielson( 2009) showed that older adults with visual impairments( aged 65 and older) were less likely to report that they were current drinkers than were older sighted adults. Because Kooner et al. and Jones et al. assessed middle-aged or older adults, their results can not be generalized to adolescents with visual impairments. </p> In contrast to the assumption that alcohol use may be more common among individuals with visual impairments, there are two arguments for lower levels of alcohol use in this group. First, adolescents often consume alcohol in a peer context, such as at a party or while dating( Power, Stewart, Hughes, &; Arbona, 2005) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predictor of adolescents ' alcohol use and binge drinking( Crawford &; Novak, 2002). Since several studies( for example, Lifshitz, Hen, &; Weisse, 2007 ; Sacks &; Wolffe, 1998) found that adolescents with visual impairments spend less time with peers and more time alone than do sighted adolescents, they may have fewer opportunities to consume alcohol. Second, in Germany, for example, the legal age for drinking and buying beer is 16 years, and buying and consuming spirits are prohibited before age 18. Thus, younger adolescents with visual impairments may have more problems gaining access to alcohol because they may not have many older friends who could buy alcohol for them. </p> Research questions Given the lack of comparative studies on alcohol use by sighted and visually impaired adolescents, the first research question focused on differences in alcohol use between these groups. We expected that adolescents with visual impairments would report a later age at first drunkenness, fewer episodes of drunkenness and binge drinking, and lower average amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the differences between adolescents with visual impairments and sighted adolescents in the use of alcohol would vary by age. Since alcohol consumption increases across adolescence, we expected that the differences between the two groups in the frequency of drunkenness, binge drinking, and the amount of alcohol consumed would increase across adolescence. The third research question focused on the role of integration into a peer group in explaining differences in alcohol consumption between sighted students and those with visual impairments. Because adolescents with visual impairments, on average, report having more peer problems and most adolescents are likely to drink alcohol in the peer context, we expected that the lower level of alcohol use of adolescents with visual impairments would be explained, in part, by these adolescents ' lower peer group integration. </p> Methods SAMPLE In the longitudinal ongoing Marburg Study on Vision Loss( MARVIL), adolescents with visual impairments were recruited from two German special schools for students who are blind or have low vision. Because most German adolescents who are visually impaired attend special schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools. MARVIL addresses the psychological development of German adolescents with and without visual impairments. A broad range of outcome variables is measured, such as success with solving age-associated developmental tasks( like building friendships and intimate relationships), the experience of discrimination, and internalizing and externalizing problem behavior. </p> The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the German Psychological Society. After we obtained permission from the schools and informed consent from the parents and adolescents, 6th to 11th graders answered our questions in their classes. The assessment instruments were administered orally by the assessor, and the students typed their answers into their laptop computers. From 184 potentially available students, 161 participated in the study( participation rate 87.5%). Three participants were excluded from the analysis because they were older than age 20. Fifty-nine participants were blind a visual acuity of less than 20/400( 6/ 120) or a corresponding visual field loss of less than 10 degrees in the better eye with the best possible correction and the others had low vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, or a corresponding visual field loss of less than 20 degrees in the better eye with the best possible correction) according to the International Stastical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision( ICD-10 ; World Health Organization, 2007). About 13% of the students with visual impairments also had a second disability, such as a hearing impairment( n = 4) or mobility impairment( n = 2). The sample included day students( 87%) and residential students( 13%). </p> Sighted 6th to 11th graders were recruited from schools in the surrounding areas of the schools for students with visual impairments. After we obtained the permission of the schools and the parents, the students filled out a questionnaire in their classes. About 5% of the students did not participate in the study because of their lack of interest or absence on the day of data collection. Furthermore, 32 students were excluded because of missing values on alcohol use. In total, data from 537 sighted students were included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were more likely to be male than were the sighted students F( 1,725) = 5.99, p &lt;.05,? =.008, we controlled for this variable in the analyses. </p> Because we plan to collect longitudinal data, we collected only data from students from the highest school track( gymnasium), since they can be contacted in their schools for another four years. The participants were, on average, 15 years old( SD = 1.9 ; range 12-19 years), and 52% of them were female. </p> MEASURES Visual impairment A dummy variable was constructed comprising the information on school membership( visual impairment = 1, no visual impairment = 0). We also asked the sighted participants whether they had trouble seeing that could not be corrected with eyeglasses( 0 = no ; 1 = yes), and no student answered this question affirmatively. In addition, we asked the participants who were blind or had low vision about their level of visual impairment according to their certificate of disability. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the respondents are blind according to the ICD-10 criteria. </p> Drunkenness With a single-item indicator, the participants were asked whether they had already experienced drunkenness( 1 = yes, 0 = no). If they said yes, they were then asked about their age at first drunkenness and about the frequency of experiences of drunkenness during the previous 12 months. </p> Alcohol use First, the participants were asked about the number of days they drank beer, wine, alcopops( beverages containing alcohol and added ingredients, such as fruit juices or other flavorings), and distilled spirits during the previous month. Second, we assessed the average number of consumed glasses of alcohol per occasion of drinking. We computed the total amount of alcohol consumed by multiplying the number of days they consumed alcohol, the average number of glasses of alcohol they consumed, and the number of grams of alcohol per glass taken from standard tables, and summed the amounts across the assessed types of beverages( Federal Center for Health Education, 2007) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of glasses of alcohol consumed on one occasion during the previous month, we classified adolescents as binge drinkers if male adolescents consumed five glasses or more on an occasion and if female adolescents consumed four glasses and more( following Midanik, 1999 ; 1 = yes, 0 = no). </p> Peer group integration With single-item indicators, we asked whether the participants ever belonged to a peer group( 1 = yes, 0 = no) and how successful they were in becoming a member of a peer group( 3 = have finished this task, 2 = in the process of building a peer group, 1 = not yet started this task). </p> Results About 32% of the students with visual impairments and 49% of the sighted students reported that they had been drunk. We used the Cox regression analysis( Cox, 1972) to analyze whether vision status and gender would predict the age-at-first-drunkenness score. Cox regression has the advantage over logistic regression in that it takes into account the age of the participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called censored cases). Vision status and gender were entered as independent variables. We found significant effects of vision status( B = -1.06, Exp(B) =.35, p &lt;.001) and female gender( B = -.38, Exp(B) =.69, p,.001). As Figure 1 shows, the participants who were visually impaired had a later age-at-first-drunkenness score. The median age at first drunkenness was 15 years for the sighted students and 18 years for the students with visual impairments. Similarly, all the female participants were less likely to have experienced drunkenness( 41%) than were their male peers( 49%) and were estimated to experience their first episode of drunkenness at age 16, compared to 15 years for the male adolescents. </p> In the next step, we analyzed predictors of the frequency of reported episodes of drunkenness during the previous 12 months. The participants reported, on average, 4.5( SD = 10.7) episodes of drunkenness. An analysis of covariance was computed with the frequency of reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as independent variables, and gender as a covariate. Because relatively fewer 18-year-old( n = 55) and 19-year-old( n = 12) students were available than were 12- to 18-year-old students( n = 94-126), we combined two successive age groups into four joint categories( 12-13year olds, 14-15 year olds, 16-17 year olds, and 18-19 year olds) to get more robust results. We found significant main effects of vision status, age, and gender and a significant interaction effect of vision status and age. Vision status explained 6.3% of the variance in the dependent variable, and the interaction effect of vision status and age explained another 4.1%( see Table 1). The participants with visual impairments reported, on average, fewer episodes of drunkenness( M = 1.4, SD = 3.7) than did those who were sighted( M = 5.5 ; SD = 12.0). As Figure 2 indicates, the participants with visual impairments started at a lower level and showed a lower increase in the frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the female participants reported, on average, fewer episodes of drunkenness( M = 3.7, SD = 8.8) than did the male participants( M = 5.5, SD = 12.4). </p> Overall, about 36% of the participants reported at least one episode of binge drinking during the previous month ; 39.7% of the sighted participants and 15.5% of those who were visually impaired answered the question affirmatively. With an analysis of covariance( ANCOVA), we found significant effects of vision status and age and an interaction effect of vision status and age. However, we found no significant gender differences in binge drinking( see Table 1). The vision status x age interaction effect indicates that differences between the sighted students and the students with visual impairments increased over time. For example, 5% and 8% of the 12-13 year olds with and without visual impairment, respectively, reported binge drinking during the previous month. However, among the 18-19 year olds, the sighted binge drinkers( 74.1%) clearly outnumbered the binge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next step, we analyzed the amount of alcohol consumed during the previous week. The participants reported consuming, on average, 50.5 grams( 1.8 ounces) of alcohol during that time( SD = 95.64). An ANCOVA was computed with the amount of alcohol as the dependent variable, vision status and age group as independent variables, and gender as a covariate. We found significant statistical main effects of vision status, age, and gender and a significant interaction effect of age and vision status( see Table 1). In line with our expectation, the participants with visual impairments consumed, on average, lower amounts of alcohol( M = 20.5 grams 0.7 ounces per week) than did the sighted prticipants( M = 58.9 grams 2.0 ounces per week). In addition, the main effect of age indicates that alcohol consumption increased with age( from 4.7 grams 0.2 ounces per week among the 12-13 year olds to 82.9 grams 2.9 ounces per week among the 18-19 year olds). Furthermore, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( M = 59.9 grams 2.1 ounces per week) than did the female participants( M = 41.5 grams 1.5 ounces per week). Finally, the interaction effect of age and vision status indicates that the size of the differences between the participants with visual impairments and the sighted participants increased across adolescence( see Figure 3). </p> We also tested whether the level of alcohol use differed between the participants who were blind and those with low vision. Although the participants who were legally blind had slightly lower scores on all measures than did those with low vision, the differences did not reach statistical significance : drunkenness : F( 1,156) =.67, n.s. ; binge drinking : F( 1,156) =.37, n.s. ; grams of alcohol per week : F( 1,156) =.05, n.s. </p> A higher proportion of students with visual impairments( 26%) than of sighted students( 10%) reported that they had never belonged to a peer group : F( 1,720) = 29.69, p @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported lower success in belonging to a peer group at present : M = 2.45 versus M = 2.64 ; F( 1,725) = 11.01, p &lt;.001. With regard to the final research question, we analyzed whether the observed effects of vision status would be explained, at least in part, by the lower peer group integration of students with visual impairments. We reran the ANCOVAS and included the two indicators of peer group integration( ever belonged to a peer group and peer group membership at present) as additional covariates. We observed that the amount of variance explained by vision status dropped from 6.3% to 4.9%( drunkenness), from 7.1% to 5.6%( binge drinking), and from 5.9% to 4.7%( grams of alcohol during the last week). Thus, the proportion of variance explained by vision status was reduced by 20% to 22%. However, the effect of vision status remained statistically significant in all the analyses. </p> Discussion This study was the first to show that adolescents with visual impairments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drunkenness and binge drinking, and experience their first episode of drunkenness at a later age than do their sighted peers. The reported alcohol use of the sighted participants was similar to reports of representative studies on German adolescents( Federal Center for Health Education, 2004, 2007 ; Hibell et al., 2004), thus supporting the validity of the measures we used in our study. </p> Although several authors suggested that individuals with visual impairments drink more alcohol, for example, to cope with their disability and associated stressors( Buss &; Cramer, 1989 ; Koch et al., 2002 ; Nelipovich et al., 1998), our results indicate that they drink less, at least in adolescence. The lower alcohol consumption of the participants with visual impairments was explained, in part, by their lower peer group integration, which is associated with less access to alcohol and fewer opportunities to drink. We may even have underestimated the effect of peer group integration, since we used only two global questions and did not ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nonetheless, because our measures of peer group integration explained only slightly more than 20% of the effect of vision status, other factors have to be considered that may explain the relatively low levels of alcohol use in students with visual impairments. Since a recent meta-analysis found lower levels of psychological distress in children and adolescents with visual impairment than in adults with visual impairments( Pinquart &; Pfeiffer, in press), our findings suggest that adolescents with visual impairments may be less likely than adults with visual impairments to require alcohol to cope with their disability and associated stressors, perhaps because of additional support provided by schools for students with visual impairments. In addition, since a study on older adults with visual impairments also found lower levels of alcohol use than in sighted older adults( Jones et al., 2009), one may also speculate that visual impairment sensitizes individuals to health risks and may promote positive health behaviors. </p> Limitations and conclusions This study had some limitations. Similarly to other studies, we had to rely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies have shown that adolescents give reliable and valid responses to these questions( see, for example, Williams, Toomey, McGovern, Wagenaar, &; Perry, 1995). Although it would have been possible to collect additional information on adolescents ' alcohol use from parents or teachers, we do not believe that these persons would have sufficient knowledge to provide valid answers. We also had no reason to believe that sighted students and students with visual impairments would differ in their willingness to report alcohol use. In addition, we focused on students from the highest school track. Students from lower school tracks are expected to show higher substance use( Federal Center for Health Education, 2007), but this higher use would probably be found in both those who are sighted and those with visual impairments. Thus, the selection of students from the highest school track is unlikely to have affected the observed differences between the two groups of students or the observed age differences. Furthermore, drinking habits in the United States and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, research is needed on whether similar results would be found in other countries. Finally, because age differences may be confounded with differences among cohorts, we plan to collect follow-up data on changes in alcohol use over time. </p> Despite these limitations, we conclude that although the prevention of alcohol misuse may be a less relevant goal for students with visual impairments than for sighted students, there are a minority of binge drinkers and those who experience drunkenness who may benefit from prevention efforts. In addition, several authors have highlighted the need to promote the peer group integration of students with visual impairments( see, for example, Sacks &; Gaylord-Ross, 1989). When following this requirement, practitioners should keep in mind that these measures may be at the expense of a health hazard, since the increase in peer group integration is likely to be associated with an increase in alcohol use, binge drinking, and drunkenness. Thus, those who help adolescents to develop general social competence for building and maintaining social relationships should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry on a conversation with people at a party or to promote peer relations in general( Wenzel, Weichold, &; Silbereisen, 2009). </p> Since this was the first study on alcohol use by adolescents with visual impairments, we recommend that more comparative research on drinking habits from different countries should be conducted. Second, research is needed on the social contexts of alcohol use of adolescents with visual impairments. For example, how do the observed lower levels of alcohol use of students with visual impairments relate to differences in patterns of leisure activities, such as partying or attending discotheques? Do students with visual impairments from integrated schools have more access to alcohol than adolescents from special schools for students who are visually impaired? Third, because it has been suggested that alcohol may be used to cope with visual impairment, research is needed on the motives for using alcohol of adolescents with visual impairments. Finally, from a lifespan perspective, more research is needed that compares the drinking habits of individuals with and without visual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grant Pi291/9-1 from the German Research Council. </p> Table 1 Associations of vision status, age, and gender with drunkenness and the amount of alcohol consumption. pre-formatted table GRAPH : Figure 1.
