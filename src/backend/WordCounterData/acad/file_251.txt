4170541 # Martha Divine is afraid to fly. It is not the cascading space entered upon reaching altitude at thirty thousand feet that causes her fear. Rather it is the take off and the landing, the interstice between two geographic spaces, the space between ground and air. This intermediary space between being grounded and in full flight piques Martha 's fear surrounding her identity. For Martha : "... los aterrizajes y los despegues siempre le revuelcan el ansia. Y no hay ansia en este mundo que no le provocara a Martha pensar en su cuerpo. Oh sf, su cuerpo, el disfraz que era su cuerpo. Temblaba de solo pensar que alguien, en pleno take-off, la se&ntilde;alara con el dedo y gritara : -Miren eso. Eso no es una mujer "( Santos-Febres 23). Martha 's anxiety surrounding the intermediary spaces of air travel is grafted on to her pre-operational body. The fear of discovery, of not passing assimilated, manifest in a physical and psychic space between national and geographic boundaries and the borders that mark and make bodies intelligible. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claiming the self, is a perceptible trope in contemporary Hispanic Caribbean literature. It is my aim, then, to put Martha at ease ; to investigate the ways in which this intermediary, interstitial, and still very real space becomes a location where authors begin to reshape the relationship between temporal, spatial, and social borders and the bodies these borders attempt to define. # Specifically, I analyze the ways in which Mayra Santos-Febres ' novel Sirena Selena vestida de pena( 2000) challenges the construction and enactment of subjectivity with relation to categories of identity. Specifically focusing upon the markers of nationality, sexuality, and race, Santos-Febres represents bodies that, while still identifiable by certain markers of identity, challenge the reduction of the body to a simplified correlative identification with categories of identity. Santos-Febres represents how transnational subjectivity undoes the concept of identity as a discrete, closed categorization. # It is through the transnational that the body is queered ; it finds itself in a space that is not regulated by the heteronormative demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heterosexual coupling and the propagation of the nation. Rather, transnationality challenges subjecthood as a stable and identifiable position, and complicates the relationship between nationality, expression of gender and sexuality, and affective bonds. Affective bonds are key for the present study, particularly how queer articulations of these connections allows for new formulations of kinship. Queer(ed) articulations of family/kinship networks allow for reconceptualized understandings of subjects as members of a transnational rhizomatic affective network, rather than geographically isolated beings. Importantly, queer, as articulated in this essay, represents more than non-heteronormative relationships ; it is the radical questioning of structures of heteronormative and homonormative affective bonds and family relationships. Kinship is reinterpreted as a malleable social construct that can be altered and adjusted to fit the needs of people and communities. Transnationality facilitates networks of affect that allow for a queer reading of family and kinship. While analyzing the forms of queer kinship that arise in this contemporary Puerto Rican novel, I engage in a theoretical analysis of the relationship between heteronormativity, the structuring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use space. This theoretical background is key to understanding how Mayra SantosFebres challenges traditional structures of family and kinship through narrative. Specifically I underscore the relationship between shifting paradigms of family structures and the emergence of queer transnational identifications. # The traditional mask of heteronormativity is the family, as it is articulated and defined in the United States and the wider Western world. While typically a marker of social stability, the heteronormative family represents a facile security blanket that can lovingly smother nonnormative departures from this supposed familial stability. This is not to say that all traditional families are secretly crumbling from within, but rather, one should not consider the heteronormative family the only option for cultural and social intelligibility. This is especially important when considering the history of marginalized or outcast populations of economically disenfranchised bodies, racially subjugated bodies, and. among many others, queer bodies. Of particular importance for an analysis of Santos-Febres 's novel is the marginalization of trans bodies. Increased scholarly interest in and activist engagement with trans identities have brought more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trans body, new formulations of kinship arise. As the trans body exists outside of the heteronormative framework of the male/female and masculine/feminine binary, kinship ties are not necessarily dependent on marriage or familial bloodlines. In Undoing Gender, Judith Butler notes that # Efforts to establish bonds of kinship that are not based on a marriage tie become nearly illegible and unviable when marriage sets the terms for kinship, and kinship itself is collapsed into " family. " The enduring social ties that constitute viable kinship in communities of sexual minorities are threatened with becoming unrecognizable and unviable as long as the marriage bond is the exclusive way in which both sexuality and kinship are organized.( 5) # The expansion of the family from bloodlines to social interconnectivity provides queer and trans bodies with a network of support and love at times not available within the heteronormative family. Furthermore, trans kinship engages in restructuring rigid notions of kinship, so that " the rights and obligations of kinship may take any number of other forms other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. In the novel, each character represents a new formulation of trans and queer identities. I will analyze the new manifestations of kinship present in Sirena Selena vestida de pena to argue that rather than allegorizing the trans body as something unintelligible, Santos-Febres expands the possibilities of identification of the trans/queer body through the performative, as theorized by Judith Butler. Furthermore, Judith Halberstam 's formulations of queer time and queer space consider space and time outside of heteronormative family time and illustrates how traditional forms of kinship are reconsidered within the newly developed trans kinship. This opening of representation allows new forms of kinship to develop, which break the hegemonic mold of the heteronormative family. # However, in parting with much scholarship on the novel Sirena Selena vestida de pena, I argue that perhaps the most queer body of all is the one that outwardly presents the most heteronormative presence, that of Hugo Graubel, a sugar magnate and hotelier. While the bodies that are visually counter hegemonic( those of the transvestite, the transsexual, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of queer familial stability, the hegemonic body of Graubel exists discontentedly within the heteronormative framework of a wealthy, white family, and seeks companionship with the femme fatale/nubile young boy that is Sirena Selena.1 The purpose of my reading is to dissolve the rigid binaries between male/female, masculine/feminine, and **27;4865;TOOLONG. The visual presence of the body is not enough to determine whether one falls into the heteronormative family time or the newly formulated queer time. This is not to ignore, however, the new queer formulations of familial stability desired by the counter hegemonic body. Rather, I hope to reveal the queer kinship that develops among the queer and trans identified characters, such as Selena, Martha Divine, and Leocadio, as well as to demonstrate that even the most stereotypically heteronormative character in Santos-Febres 's novel exists within the framework of new queer kinship. The destabilization of gender binaries and social and economic divisions allows for a formulation of queer kinship that integrates both the typically marginalized body( the visually different body) and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across geographic spaces expands articulations of queer and trans subjectivity, effectively aligning queer and trans movement with the particular enactments of identity forged by each character. # Sirena Selena vestida de pena focuses on the journey of Martha Divine, a transgender entrepreneur, performer and owner of the Puerto Rican nightclub " El Danubio Azul ", and her prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, Selena, a young transvestite who, after her mother 's abandonment and her grandmother 's death, has taken to the streets as a prostitute and petty thief. Martha discovers Selena 's talent for singing boleros one evening outside of her nightclub, takes her in, and grooms her to become a star of drag performance. The main action of the novel takes place over the weeklong journey to the Dominican Republic, where Martha intends to debut Selena 's talent, since child labor laws in Puerto Rico complicate Selena 's performance. Notably, Selena is constantly referred in the text as a quincea&ntilde;era or fifteen year old. It is this transnational movement that facilitates enactments of queer identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performances in Puerto Rico, it is the geographic and ideological space of the Dominican Republic that affords a place in which Selena 's queer identity is enacted and legitimized through public recognition. In his analysis of Dominican masculinities, E. Antonio de Moya gives an important key to understanding to the title of Santos-Febres 's novel : " In the last twenty years, transvestites have become an important part of show business, sex work and nightlife in large Dominican cities. In the household culture the word vestida( cross-dresser) is frequently used for men raised as women, who presumably look, think and behave as such, often deceiving ' real ' men "( 93). # It is worth noting the multiplicity of identities that form characters such as Selena and Martha Divine. Following Jos&eacute; Quiroga 's ideas( see 194-95), I argue that these bodies exist as sites of multiple identifications. They are not only queer bodies, but also Caribbean bodies, as well as bodies of color. The assemblage of these multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ localized space of an isolated identity world, but to mobilize these identities "( Quiroga 194). In his analysis of the film Brincando el charco, Quiroga notes that # the body has multiple points of contact, but these do not turn it into the site where the American " melting pot " is reproduced. There is constant tension between the different zones that the body may inhabit, but its possible hybridity is not immediately the cause for celebration, for everything conspires to normatize and tame the disruptions produced by different vectors on one self.( Quiroga 194) # This quotation is particularly poignant when considering trans bodies. Selena does not represent an interstice nor is she a third gender blending of male and female. Consideration of her body requires a reconceptualization of the gender binary, as well as a decoupling of the strict ties between male and masculine and female and feminine. The text achieves this decoupling through constant flashbacks that reveal the disintegration of the heteronormative family due to the overly rigid social and economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describes the pasts of Martha Divine, Sirena Selena, a young Dominican boy Leocadio, Hugo Graubel, Selena 's grandmother, as well as many other characters. For the purpose of this analysis, I will focus mainly on the histories of Martha, Selena, Leocadio, and Hugo, as they are the protagonists whose bodies enact my argument. # New forms of queer kinship in the novel exist within what Judith Halberstam describes as a queer space and time. According to Halberstam, there exists a family time as well as a queer time. Family time essentially revolves around the needs of children and supports a heteronormative framework. Furthermore, family time " connects the family to the historical past of the nation, and glances ahead to connect the family to the future of both familial and national stability "( 5). Family time is regimented by the practices of child rearing while queer time " produces alternative temporalities by allowing their participants to believe that their futures can be imagined according to logics that lie outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage, reproduction and death "( 5). As such, queer time and space " requires and produces new conceptions of space... by articulating and elaborating a concept of queer time, I suggest new ways of understanding non-normative behaviors that have clear but not essential relations to gay and lesbian subjects "( 6). In contrast with family time 's preoccupation with past and future, with queer time " speed itself( the drug as well as the motion) becomes the motor of an alternative history... "( 5). While existing within a queer time, which is inherently counter-hegemonic, all of the characters that embody queer subjectivity in Sirena Selena vestida de pena depend on the performative heteronormative standard. As Judith Butler notes, the performative " must be understood not as a singular or deliberate ' act, ' but, rather as the reiterative and citational practice by which discourse produces the effects that it names "( Butler, Bodies 2). As such, Martha Divine 's performance of femininity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Selena, represents an exaggerated manifestation of traditional femininity. However, this is not to criticize any particular manifestation of femininity. I also do not argue that by exaggerating femininity any queer agency is subsumed within the hegemonic representation, negating any possibility of self-formation. Interestingly though, each queer body yearns for a modified version of the supposed stability of the heteronormative family. This search for stability and the subsequent modification of the heteronormative family through its particularly queer formation effectively subverts the normative family model, creating a space of queer kinship. # From here, I will analyze a few instances in the text in which the visually counterhegemonic characters depend on the heteronormative performative in order to enact a personal agency and formation of queer kinship. However, I would like first to clarify my use of the phrase visually counter-hegemonic. It is clear in the text that visually, the bodies of Selena, Martha Divine, and Leocadio do not fit within the rigid binary categories of either male or female. However, one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked as male is that of Hugo Graubel, who I will argue, despite the mask afforded by his heteronormative family, represents perhaps the clearest example of a counter-heteronormative formation of queer subjectivity in the text. # On the flight to the Dominican Republic from Puerto Rico, Martha Divine is described as # ajlta y rubia oxigenada, ya con sus arrugas, con su par portentoso de pechos de siiicona, con piel incre&iacute;blemente tersa por las hendiduras del escote... No exhib&iacute;a ni un solo pelo que la delatara. Solo su altura y su voz. y sus ademanes tan femeninos, demasiado femeninos, estudiadamente femeninos.( 13) # Martha is thorough in her performative appropriation of feminine attributes ; however, she repeatedly speaks of her fear of discovery. Martha identifies as a female and has almost completed her final gender reassignment surgery. Her hopes are to gamer enough money from Selena 's shows to complete her surgery. While on the plane, Martha overlaps the fear of discovery with the interstices of air travel. The liminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dominican Republic becomes an allegory for her pre-operational body. She states her fears : " Oh s&iacute;, su cuerpo, el disfraz que era su cuerpo. Temblaba de tan solo pensar que alguien, en pleno take-off, le se&ntilde;alara con el dedo y gritara : Miren eso. Eso no es una mujer "( 23). Her ultimate desire is " quitarse la ropa y verse, al fin, de la cintura para abajo, igual que de la cintura para arriba, con tetitas y totita. Total. Al fin, poder descansar en un solo cuerpo "( 24).2 While projecting a very feminine performance there is a constant fear of discovery. The representation of travel also highlights the relationship between queer subjectivity and transnational movement. The space of flight, an in-between that is neither Puerto Rico nor the Dominican Republic, becomes a place in which queer subjectivity is articulated, enacted, but at the same time hidden for fear of discovery. The narrative makes the space of travel an opportune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, as well as the boundaries between masculine/feminine, male/female, and masculinity/femininity. While the undoing of these binaries becomes evident to the reader, it is important to highlight that it is not Martha 's objective to embody this queer space, but rather to privatize and hide it from regulatory powers that read the body through binaries. # E. Antonio de Moya underscores the political, social, and economic reality of transgender people, specifically within the Dominican Republic. He notes " most of Dominican transgenders only go as far as putting on make-up, waxing or depilating, receiving hormone treatment, and implanting silicone and similar substances into their bodies to resemble females. Only a few transgendered migrants to the United States or Europe have become transsexuals, undergoing genital surgery, probably because of high economic costs, and primarily because of the social value of being a ' phalic woman ' in a phallicist-homophobic society "( 94). The concept of political and social capital gained through status as a " phallic woman " is, while problematic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hugo Graubel. # As represented in Santos-Febres 's novel, Martha Divine does not benefit from this capital and works throughout the narrative to achieve her gender reassignment surgery. Selena, however, does benefit from this capital, but in a manner very distinct from that which Moya describes. Moya articulates that retaining the phallus extends a fractional amount of social and political power to a subject who, otherwise, is completely devoid of masculinity owing to their physical and social resemblance to females. However, while this can be read as a particularly queer way to access political agency/visibility, it is still couched upon the political power of masculinity embodied through the phallus. Rather, as represented in the novel, it is important to consider the variety of gender expressions at play, and to understand how cultural notions of Dominican masculinity complicate or reinforce these representations. There are no maleidentified characters in the novel that fit within Moya 's category of " hegemonic masculinities. " 3 Importantly, this emphasizes the notion of gender identity as performative, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repetition. # Martha Divine 's almost post-operational body represents the interstices between space and time. As such, it is important to signal the spatial and temporal division between the action of the story( the Caribbean, more specifically Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic) and the sought-after metropolis, New York City. New York City is represented as a utopia of selfexpression and queer embodiment. Martha Divine highlights the notion of space, temporality, and freedom as represented in the space of New York City as opposed to the rural area where she grew up : # All&aacute;, en sus pa&iacute;ses, se reproduc&iacute;an, heredaban, enterraban padres y abuelos, coman caballos por las haciendas y se comportaban como los futuros pr&oacute;ceres de la patria. Pero ac&aacute;. en Nueva York, se aflojaban las corbatas de sus trajes grises, soltaban los maletines con permisos para exportar fanegas de flores, minerales o caf&eacute;, y entre botellas, pastillas polvos alucin&oacute;genos, volaban las boas de plumas, los rubores para labios y efebos con faldas que @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era en verdad el gozo y la perdici&oacute;n.( 126-27) # Underscoring Halberstam 's conceptualization of queer time and space, the space of Martha 's past( and it is important here to note the temporal aspect of space as it relates to memory) represents heteronormative conceptualizations of space and time and the link to projects of representing nationhood. # According to Martha, in rural space( and notably, again, this space is located temporally in the past), heteronormative actions are tied to the politics or respectability and the development of heteronormatively driven people who develop national projects. Furthermore, the space of the rural past is described linearly, marked by those key moments of heteronormative time, such as reproduction, inheritance, and death. Halberstam " tries to use the concept of queer time to make clear how respectability, and notions of the normal on which it depends, may be upheld by a middle-class logic of reproductive temporality "( Halberstam 4). The space of Martha 's past, which represents projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teleological impulse towards the future. The productive relationships described in Martha 's past( which, importantly is linked to rural space) have as their objective procreation and the propagation of a national identity. Queer time, in contrast, represents specific models of temporality that emerge within postmodemity once one leaves the temporal frames of bourgeois reproduction and family, longevity, risk/safety and inheritance( Halberstam 6). My challenge to this particular formulation lies in the word leave. For one, leaving temporal frames of bourgeois time implies that everyone is born into this temporal frame, which, as Halberstam notes, is not the case. As I will demonstrate, Selena is not bom into a heteronormative temporal/spatial frame. Secondly, the act of leaving implies a choice, which is not often the case. In the novel, for example, Leocadio is forced out of heteronormative time/space for reasons beyond his control. Furthermore, social discrimination of queer bodies can also force them out of heteronormative time/space. Lastly, the idea of leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is never truly possible. One is always on the edge of intelligibility, and can never truly leave or exist outside of productive powers. Butler states # for there is an " outside " to what is constructed by discourse, but this is not an absolute " outside, " an ontological thereness that exceeds or counters the boundaries of discourse ; as a constitutive " outside, " it is that which can only be though-when it can-in relation to that discourse, at and as its most tenuous borders.( Butler, Bodies 8) # Transnational Caribbean space further problematizes the notion of leaving a particular space, specifically because, even if the physical space of the island is not present, it is discursively present in conceptualizations of the transnational community as an imagined community, as described by Benedict Anderson in Imagined Communities : Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism( 6). Furthermore, the space of the island is always present in the construction of transnational subjectivity, whether one defines oneself with or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly between the Hispanic Caribbean and the United States, have an extensive history of back and forth movement between nations. Queer Caribbean space and time, as well as transnational articulations of queer Caribbean space and time must be theorized in a slightly different manner than proposed by Halberstam, specifically because of the paradoxical distance/proximity of the geographical and psychological space of the island within transnational communities. # Returning to Martha 's description of the past and future, the space of New York City, in contrast to the rural space of the island, is described as a non-linear m&eacute;lange of alternative sights, sounds, and experiences. New York City exists within the novel as a utopie vision on the part of the characters, but more importantly, in its depiction within the novel, the city defies heteronormative conceptualizations of spatiality and temporality. Notably, in her description of the rural space of her past and the metropolitan space of her past and future, Martha 's terminology again undoes binary divisions of here versus there and past versus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicates a far-away indeterminate space, the English equivalent of " over or back there " and ac&aacute;, which indicates the exact space from which one is speaking or the English equivalent of " right here " complicates Martha 's narration of time and space. This is because Martha is speaking of the past when describing both her rural upbringing and her three years spent in New York City. Yet when describing the temporal events of the past, she uses terminology to spatially mark herself in a hyper-present moment represented by the use of ac&aacute;. As such, this passage describes the queer space of New York City, while actualizing a queer space through enunciation and by complicating the idea that time and space are wholly separate or divided categories. # It is specifically this projected desire towards the North American metropolis of New York City that allows one to theorize queer Caribbean space and time in new ways. The utopie projection of the expanded Caribbean enables characters to reconceptualize space and time beyond rigid divisions between here and there or past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fluidity of the space and time of the island. While New York City becomes a space of unbridled queemess, in which each character can enact personal and professional desires it also presents a space of Caribbeanness that extends beyond the geographic and national boundaries of the islands of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. # Returning to the protagonists of the novel, Selena travels more comfortably amongst borders dividing male and female than her mentor, Martha Divine. For this reason, the text switches freely between masculine and feminine pronouns and markers while describing Selena. Upon arrival at the Hotel Conquistador, Martha scolds Selena for jumping on the bed : # Nena, no brinques as&iacute; en las camas, que no quiero problemas con la **34;4894;TOOLONG Martha, severa, pero aguantando la risa por dentro al ver a su hijita tan feliz, tan risue&ntilde;a, tan despreocupada de la vida. Pocas veces la hab&iacute;a visto as&iacute;... dej&aacute;ndose ser el ni&ntilde;o que era.( 29, my emphasis) # However visually variable( and aurally, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gender may be, her most contestatory asset, or that which destabilizes gender binaries the most, is in fact that which defines gender heteronormatively, her penis. While Martha helps her apply her make up and prepare her body for the show, the reader voyeuristically observes the description of Selena 's genitals : # Martha disipaba la gula y la sorpresa ante el tama&ntilde;o genital de su ahijadita. Asombrada, no se pod&iacute;a explicar c&oacute;mo, de un cuerpito tan fr&aacute;gil y delgado, colgaba semejante guindalejo. La verga de Sirena era inmensa, un poquito grotesca por la falta de proporci&oacute;n que guardaba con el resto del cuerpo.( 55) # In describing these characteristics, Moya signals # paradoxically, feminine behavior in boys with androgynous characteristics may be tolerated and even reinforced in this Dominican culture. This can occur under special borderline circumstances, such as being the only boy in a family of five or more sisters, or being the last boy in a long family( more than five to seven children) and, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is, having a " sacred phallus. ' '( 92, my emphasis) # Selena defies heteronormative articulations of femininity and masculinity. For Butler, the necessity of appropriating heteronormative femininity depends " becoming undone "( Undoing Gender 3). According to Butler, " the T that I am finds itself at once constituted by norms and dependent on them but also endeavors to live in ways that maintain a critical distance and transformative relation to them "( Butler, Undoing Gender 3). The question of intelligibility depends on the performed and consistently reinforced gender norms of prescribed femininity. In pushing the limits of intelligibility, one risks becoming unreal : # Those who live outside the conjugal frame or maintain modes of social organization for sexuality that are neither monogamous nor quasi-marital are more and more considered unreal, and their loves and losses less than " true " loves and " true " losses. The derealization of this domain of human intimacy and sociality works by denying reality and truth to the relations at issue. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the narrative frame of the novel, I argue that owing to the overarching presence of queer subjectivities, the pain and loss of these unreal subjects becomes painfully real. One only need look at the rape of Selena and also the death of her friend Valentina. While these are subjects who typically exist on the periphery of society for reasons of bodily intelligibility and economic standing, within the narrative framework, they are the center. They are the focus of the work and thereby become hyper-real in their narrative presence. # Another significant character in the novel, Leocadio, serves as a parallel to Selena. He is a young Dominican boy who, like Selena, has been abandoned by his mother. Leocadio also represents another visually non-hegemonic body. While not a transvestite, nor transgender, Leocadio 's male identified body is marked by an excess of femininity that is noticed by his mother, by himself, and by various men around him. This excessive femininity creates a need to protect and shelter Leocadio, specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Upon encountering a libidinous man on the beach, Leocadio thinks to himself " hab&iacute;a que regresar a donde estaba Mam&aacute;. Ella era el salvo conducto, la piedra de toque. Si lo ve&iacute;an con ella, lo dejar&iacute;an tranquilo "( 62). The need to protect Leocadio extends to his new queer family established with do&ntilde;a Adelina. She inherits a house from her aunts and with her life savings dedicates herself to informally adopting boys from the streets and taking care of them. The boys in the family help support do&ntilde;a Adelina financially through petty robbery, legitimate jobs in hotels, and prostitution. This example of new kinship demonstrates what Elena GrauLleveria describes as : # Comunidades alternativas que estos grupos marginados crean y c&oacute;mo a trav&eacute;s de ellas se instaura un sistema educativo y se genera un apoyo emocional que prepara a sus miembros para desarrollar proyectos econ&oacute;micos cuya &uacute;ltima finalidad es conseguir una mayor autoestima de s&iacute; mismo y una posici&oacute;n de m&aacute;s poder frente a una sociedad que los niega tanto por tendencia social como por estrato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk about increased self-esteem through prostitution, it must be noted that both Leocadio and his best friend and mentor Migueles also have ' legitimate ' jobs.4 However, the legitimacy and/or illegitimacy of their jobs, in terms of legality, respectability, or intelligibility, does not regulate nor impede upon queer practices. It is obliquely stated that Migueles, while working as a waiter at the Hotel Col&oacute;n, has more intimate interactions with the male guests. When Migueles insists that he does not want two of the same watch as a gift from a client, he reveals his encounters with North American and European men, while at the same time renouncing homosexuality. Speaking of the differences amongst clients he notes # los europeos son mejores que los gringos. Saben respetar a los hombres y no se ponen con eso de querer besar a uno, ni cogerle la mano en p&uacute;blico. Hacen lo suyo, si acaso, y ya. Pero al fin y a la postre, todos ellos se parecen. Les encantan los dominicanos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ las mismas bober&iacute;as.( 218) # This discourse on sexual tourism mixes Migueles 's sexual relations with men with a need to maintain or affirm his masculinity. The dialogue becomes queer in itself. He speaks of how well men respect him, while emphasizing that they do not try to kiss him in public. The privacy of affection, for Migueles, becomes a form of respect, because he does not want his masculinity questioned publicly. However, it is important to consider the culturally variant notion of homosexuality in certain Latin American contexts. In Mexican Masculinities, Robert McKee Irwin notes that in Mexico, and I would argue in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico " acts of affection between men, which might be read as homoerotic today, passed unnoticed as long as those men involved appeared to be masculine "( xxii). As such, the interactions between Migueles and the tourists would not be read necessarily as homosexual if Migueles maintained the binary division between male versus female and masculinity versus femininity. However, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship that develops between Migueles and Leocadio. The desire for intimacy( although not necessarily sexual) and interpersonal contact trumps the need to maintain a macho fa&ccedil;ade : # Pero &eacute;l Migueles era un hombre ya, y un hombre guarda sus secretos. No anda por ah&iacute; &iquest;iri&eacute;ndole a todo el mundo lo que piensa ni lo que hace. Los hombres son reservados y no les gusta el chisme. Y Migueles insist&iacute;a en que &eacute;l era un hombre hecho y derecho. Pero le gustaba conversar con Leocadio.( 214) # Importantly, the narrative also highlights the implications of North American and European sexual tourism in the Caribbean, a form of tourism that directly affects Migueles, Leocadio, and even Selena. # Chapter 15, written entirely in English, demonstrates the perspective of a Canadian sex tourist towards the Caribbean other. When speaking about gay rights in the Caribbean he states, " It is understandable that they are not as evolved as us in these matters. I mean, we had Stonewall, we had Act-up, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "( 207). While noting the dangers of being openly gay in the Caribbean( as if there were no difference between Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, or Cubans who are out of the closet) he clearly states " no, honey, I did not come here to play the spy nor to give free psychiatric counseling to my Caribbean sisters in distress. Done that, been there, without having to pay airfare. That is no way to spend a vacation "( 208). Rather, his intentions are " to be half naked, running around the beach, filled to the brim with pretty boys. And where else can you get that at a fair price? The Caribbean! "( 208). These statements clearly demarcate the rigidly established division between developed and developing world economies, as well as between races. The speaker objectifies the boys ' " pretty chocolate skin "( 209) and finds it " cute " when, after having sex, " they the boys revert back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "( 209). # Migueles must work against these stereotypes and imposed identities. Migueles and Leocadio, like Selena and Martha, inhabit sites of multiple identifications. According to Jos&eacute; Esteban Mu&ntilde;oz " identity is enacted by minority subjects who must work with/resist the conditions of( im) possibility that dominant cultures generate "( 6). I argue here that Migueles, like Selena, enacts a form of disidentification, which according to Mu&ntilde;oz # is a strategy that works on and against dominant ideology. Instead of buckling under the pressures of dominant ideology( identification, assimilation) or attempting to break free of its inescapable sphere( counteridentification, utopianism), this " working on and against " is a strategy that tries to transform a cultural logic from within...( II) # Migueles disidentifies with the perceived role of a young boy who works in a tourist hotel. He utilizes and works against this prescribed role for the purpose of economic survival. Furthermore, he enacts an agency : while he depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain, he will eventually subvert it, being that his ultimate goal is to escape the Hotel Col&oacute;n in order to open a business in Puerto Rico. One can assume that Migueles interacts with men like the Canadian sex tourist at his work, considering the Canadian tourist is staying at the Hotel Col&oacute;n. # However, the power of Migueles 's new found economic standing garnered through his encounters with clients must be analyzed. He gains respect from the other boys in his extended family, as well as inspiring and eventually helping Leocadio to get a job at the hotel as a dishwasher. Leocadio is also seduced by the power of this economy, and always hopes to steal a glance of the forbidden bar. The bar at the Hotel Col&oacute;n is where the men and the boys rendezvous and it is also where Leocadio and Migueles reveal the deeper relationship that exists between them. Migueles shows Leocadio how the men dance together and explains to him that it is not always the larger man that leads, but rather " el @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ El otro es la mujer "( 273). Migueles establishes heteronormative gender roles are established, even between non-heteronormative couples. However, this statement also skillfully decouples masculinity/femininity from maleness/femaleness. The roles of masculinity and femininity are adopted and performed by either sex, depending on how each partner negotiates these roles. # Importantly, masculinity is discursively constructed and patrolled through performative repetition. While homosocial relations between men regulate the policing of gender roles, Moya signals the importance of women in policing gender expression in the Dominican Republic, stating # Women have been seen as playing a pivotal role in the cultural transmission of gender anxiety and homophobia to the younger generations. Parents strongly fear that their children could eventually " become " homosexual and, because of this, the mother tends to behave as the guardian of child sexuality....( 72) # Moya highlights the relationship between class and gender expression : # Mostly in the upper-middle and middle classes in the Dominican Republic, who are mainly concerned with social power, there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) etiquette for gendering both the verbal and non-verbal behavior of young boys away from " femininity. "( 72) # This is visible in the way Hugo GraubeTs father handles his son 's masculinity at a young age, but is also demonstrably inverted in Martha Divine 's cultivation of Selena. Significantly, Martha acts as a guardian of Selena 's sexuality as mentioned above. # Moya demonstrates the intersections between race and class in perceptions and articulations of masculinity. He states, " instead of thinking about a single masculinity, ' hegemonic ' and ' subordinate ' forms should be recognized and studied, thus positing masculinity as a hierarchical construct "( 74). This perspective elucidates the paradoxically rigid while simultaneously fluid articulations of masculinity that occur in the Dominican Republic. Masculinity is not categorically definable as a binary position in opposition to femininity. Rather, the categorizations delimited by Moya( hegemonic, subordinate, marginal, and residual masculinities) demonstrate the relative fluidity of gender identity in the Dominican Republic. Significantly, however, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but rather of categorical imposition from naming powers. Despite the oppositional rigidity versus fluidity, there seems to be a wider variation of possibilities, especially when compared to conceptualizations of gender, race, and class identity in the United States. # For gender identity in the Dominican Republic, specifically for masculinity/masculine identification, Moya argues that " homosociai relations among men are experienced as competitive gendered relations in terms of domination-subordination, at least in the ' definitely state ' of new dyadic relationships, where they establish, probably on an unconscious basis, who is the ' male '( leader, initiator) and who is ' the female '( follower) among them "( 78). Moya 's analysis of Dominican masculinity asserts that what exemplifies masculinity is its oppositional relationship to femininity, and that being a man is exemplified by its status as not female. This dynamic sets up a relationship in which masculinity is not necessarily defined by sexual desire, while it is, however, affirmed or denied because of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male to masculinity is a diametrically opposed identification to femaleness. This relationship is couched upon the division between active( masculine) and passive( feminine) roles. According to Moya, homosexual desire is not necessarily emasculating, at least for the active participant, and " the stigma against male homosexuality partially results in the perception of this role as feminine, weak and lacking power "( 90). Masculinity is couched upon power relations rather than sexual desire. # The newly formulated queer kinship bonds between Martha, Selena, Leocadio, and Migueles demonstrate the relatively heteronormative framework of their relational bonds. Each has an ultimate desire that fits within family time as formulated by Flalberstam. Martha hopes to be comfortable in her post-operative body, Selena hopes to be economically self-sufficient, Leocadio wants a home for his family, and Migueles, like Selena, hopes to make money and establish himself. While these new queer kinships break heteronormativity in their outward presence, being that they do not fit the circumscribed definition of kinship through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the trans or queer identifications demolish the heteronormative classification of family heads as one male and one female, their ultimate life goals fit within Halberstam 's heteronormative family time. Or to quote Irune del R&iacute;o Gabiola, " both Sirena and Martha are depicted as complex individuals driven by heteronormative desires enacted through non-normative social practices "( 86). There is one character who, perhaps owing to his seemingly heteronormative and patriarchic position, has been somewhat overlooked in the analysis of new forms of kinship in Sirena Selena vestida de pena : Hugo Graubel. # Hugo Graubel represents the colonial legacy of the Dominican Republic, as well as its neoliberal future. He is the son of a wealthy sugar magnate, and has become a hotel and resort investor. He lives in a mansion in the wealthy beach resort town of Juan Dolio, outside of the capital Santo Domingo. Despite his privileged position and his seemingly perfect bourgeois family( a young wife, two lovely children, a mansion on the beach) Hugo too can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leocadio 's, was spent under the constant protection of a parental figure. However, while Leocadio 's mother protects her son 's emerging sexuality, Hugo 's father exposes and regulates it. Upon determining that his son may not be sufficiently masculine, Hugo 's father pays a woman named Eulalia to have sex with Hugo, which is described as a traumatic experience. After reaching orgasm : # Cerr&oacute; los ojos, se vio enterito por dentro, tan lejano de todos, de s&iacute;, y el terror fue tan grande que, de espanto, se ahog&oacute; en un mar. Entonces, solt&oacute; un bramido desesperado. El padre, que lo esperaba afuera, crey&oacute; que aquel bramido era serial de que el pupilo hab&iacute;a aprendido el oficio de macho. Pero el pupilo bramaba de miedo, el sentimiento m&aacute;s fuerte que hab&iacute;a sentido en toda su vida...( 144) # Hugo 's initiation into manhood becomes an irreconcilable moment around which his life spins. He describes his desire : " quer&iacute;a volver a sentir aquella sensaci&oacute;n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return, " ni borracho, ni acost&aacute;ndose con siete mil mulatas, ni dej&aacute;ndose clavar por wachimanes, ni en los ba&ntilde;os turcos, puentes y callejones del extranjero "( 145). Not even his marriage to the young Solange pacifies his trauma. A year after their union, Solange complains that the marriage has yet to be consummated. The moment of penetration dissolves his temporarily found peace, which " lo distrajo de las tardes de la playa, de los bugarrones por contrato, del deseo por los hijos preadolescentes de sus compa&ntilde;eros de la industria "( 155). The moment of consummation completely destroys this temporary satisfaction and the search for his body at peace continues. # From an outward perspective, Hugo Graubel is the epitome of the heteronormative family man. However, while characters such as Martha, Selena, Leocadio, and Migueles search for a seemingly normative future. Hugo Graubel 's desire seems counter-normative, in that, instead of conforming to the family time norms of familial sharing, he desires self-satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimate desire rests in Selena, being that she can potentially embody all that he desires : masculine, feminine, youth, experience, and such. Selena becomes emblematic of Hugo 's desire for queer time because a relationship with her will not carry the markers of heteronormative family time. With Selena, Graubel can exist within a quasi-liminal space that is not regulated by birth, child rearing, and death. Rather, a relationship with Selena begets a return to a pre-violated state, the state that Hugo so desperately searches for in his wife 's body and in his encounters with various young men. The queering, as it is represented through Graubel, becomes unmarked by family time. This allows for a relationship that deviates from one standard marker of heteronormative development : initiation into manhood. The text reveals the trauma of this event. However, in his relationship with Selena, Hugo finds a type of catharsis, which helps to heal the trauma of his forced sexual encounter. The love making between Selena and Graubel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nota cuando le cae un poco de saliva tibia entre las nalgas, y luego, sonr&iacute;e al sentirse arropado por la presi&oacute;n de un cuerpo menudito que se le trepa encima y le coloca la punta de su misterio en la boca de atr&aacute;s. Hugo se retuerce, el calor del roce lo adormila y ya no sabe nada m&aacute;s que aguantarse a las s&aacute;banas de aquella cama, mientras su sirenito lo cabalga despacio ; despu&eacute;s, m&aacute;s r&aacute;pido y m&aacute;s. Hugo se deja transportar por un susurro de carne, por una corriente de fri&oacute;, como si estuviera al fondo de algo muy azul y muy profundo.( 278) # This moment demonstrates a cathartic release on the part of Hugo Graubel, while narrating the revelation of Selena 's masculinity. This moment of calling Selena ' sirenito, ' the masculine form of ' sirena, ' allows Selena to exist outside of the highly constructed and performed act of femininity. While Selena enjoys performing, her desire to be recognized as ' sirenito ' is evidenced in the text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sirenito "( 277). At the same time, this moment further reveals Hugo 's queer subjectivity, because, rather than upholding the masculine/feminine binary in an encounter between he and Selena, recognizing Selena 's masculine sex allows him to truly recognize his desire. Furthermore, this moment decouples maleness from masculinity as well as femaleness from femininity. The fluidity of identifications opens a space of self-identification and self-actualization that does not depend on rigid social and sexual binaries. # Hugo 's desire rests in the other( Selena), and this particular other is one that embodies many possible identifications of queer subjectivity. Despite his outward heteronormativity, Hugo is in fact also identifiable within a queer subjectivity. I argue that his desired outcome is the only one that fits within Halberstam 's description of queer time. His desire is to remove himself from the family time of his current situation and to inhabit a queer time that is not demarcated by the traditional events of marriage, birth, and death. However, Selena 's drive toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Selena recognizes the lack of agency that comes from depending upon another person. She has already, although not maliciously, left Martha Divine in order to pursue her private contract with Hugo Graubel. Furthermore, she recognizes in Solange, Hugo 's wife, the entrapment that comes with being financially supported by another. Grau-Lleveria notes that Solange # crea escenarios perfectos para que otros crean lo que ella quiere ser. Sin embargo, las escenificaciones de Solange no le dan un espacio a ella ; ella se diluye como una pieza m&aacute;s del montaje general que ha dise&ntilde;ado. Su nueva identidad no depende de lazos personales sino de la imagen que recibe como la se&ntilde;ora de Graubel.( 244) # Solange, like Selena and Martha Divine, depends on the performative impulse of femininity for her economic and social survival. Societal conventions of femininity force Solange into a role that confines her to her mansion and obliges her to play the role of the good wife. Her husband is trolling for young men on the street, so she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lo necesita ahora es para ser una se&ntilde;ora, saber de tenedores, tener su puesto asegurado por toda la eternidad "( 179). Just like the female identified characters that depend on the construct of femininity for survival, so too does Solange. Furthermore, Solange, like Selena and Martha Divine, aspires to a higher social position garnered through various forms of prostitution and performance. While Solange does not work the streets, her father essentially prostitutes her to a wealthy associate( Graubel) to ensure the family 's dwindling fortune. Interestingly, Solange then also works as a foil to Graubel, who was also forced into a sexual relationship to ensure his masculinity and his father 's image. # As such, Graubel 's ultimate desire is problematized because it depends on the other. The new formulations of queer kinship represented in Sirena Selena vestida de pena depend on interconnectivity but ultimately rely on a type of personal venture capitalism, in which each member of the neo-family must depend on themselves, rather than on others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reintegration of new family members into the lines of queer kinship. Just as Selena was Martha 's prot&eacute;g&eacute;e in the beginning of the novel, there exists the possibility of finding a new prot&eacute;g&eacute;e. Upon seeing Leocadio and Migueles dancing in the bar, Martha notes, " tiene algo ese nenito, tiene algo, igualito a lo que ten&iacute;a la Sirena. Qui&eacute;n sabe. La vida da muchas vueltas. A&uacute;n le quedan br&iacute;os en los implantes. Quiz&aacute;s pueda volver a empezar "( 282). Sirena Selena vestida de pena effectively demonstrates new formulations of queer kinship, while highlighting how visually hegemonic bodies can dismantle the heteronormative drive that forcefully identifies masculinity with male and femininity with female. The characters create new bonds of kinship that depend on experience rather than blood ties and marriage. As such, these new forms of kinship would seemingly fit within Halberstam 's formulation of queer time, rather than family time. However ironically, the character that best inhabits of queer time is the wealthy sugar magnate Hugo Graubel. His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemingly compulsory identification between male and masculine, since for Graubel, Selena consistently performs the role of the femme fatale. However, at the moment of Graubel 's consummation of sexual desire, Selena is envisioned as a young boy. In this moment it is Selena who penetrates Graubel, yet this is not to argue that one plays the masculine role and the other the feminine. Furthermore, the scene of penetration is described almost as a non-penetrative act. Rather, this moment at the end of the text demonstrates the malleability of identity that works upon and against dominant identification practices, affording each character a space of self-identification that begets personal agency. # Sirena Selena vestida de pena explores how visually counter-hegemonic bodies challenge existence within a queer space or time, while demonstrating the ways in which bodies move on and against heteronormative understandings of intelligibility. Through her writing, Mayra Santos-Febres represents bodies in movement, whose subjectivities are understood beyond binary frameworks of identity. However, even those visually hegemonic bodies within SantosFebres 's work demonstrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the queer counter-discourses enacted, in varying degrees, by all of the characters in the text. Throughout Sirena Selena vestida de pena, Mayra Santos-Febres 's characters challenge identity as a discrete categorization. Whether through the kinship bonds forged between Leocadio and Migueles, or the cathartic sexual encounter between Hugo Graubel and Selena, each moment in the novel opens a space for queer representation, a space in which, perhaps, the matriarch Martha Divine will finally find comfort and belonging. Footnote # 1 Visually counter hegemonic within the space of the novel refers to bodies that, through their physical description, are clearly divergent from **25;4930;TOOLONG notions of masculine or feminine. Their purely visual presence sets up a particular expectation of difference. Footnote # 2 It is important to keep in mind that all gender representations are performances ; I do not wish to insinuate that any character 's gender as performative is in any way disingenuous. # 3 Perhaps with the exception of Graubel 's father, who forces a sexual encounter upon his young son in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son and of himself, as his son functions as an extension of his own masculinity. Footnote # 4Prostitution, while a line of work that is historically read through heteronormative interpretations of exploitation, disenfranchisement, indecency, and/or illegitimacy, can, in certain cases, be read as a form of agency, enfranchisement, and power. It is important to consider the ways in which prostitution, as represented in this text, becomes a queer form of capitalist entrepreneurship, in which subjects can gamer access to power.
