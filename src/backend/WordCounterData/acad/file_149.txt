4020441 Section : FEATURE ARTICLE <p> SCHOOLCHILDREN WHO ARE GRIEVING MAY SUFFER FROM AN INABILITY TO FOCUS ATTENTION ON INSTRUCTION AND RETAIN LEARNING. HOWEVER, TRAUMATIC AND EMOTIONALLY PAINFUL EXPERIENCES BEAR SIMILARITIES TO AESTHETIC EXPERIENCES IN THAT THEY INITIATE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WORKINGS OF THE WORLD. THE IMAGINATIVE MIND MAKES SENSE OF AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE THROUGH IMAGE, VISUAL AND LINGUISTIC RHYTHM, METAPHOR, AND SIMPLE NARRATIVE, WHICH ARE THE STUFF OF PICTURE BOOKS. PICTURE BOOKS, THEREFORE, MAY BE PARTICULARLY USEFUL TOOLS FOR REASSURING CHILDREN WHO ARE IN EMOTIONAL DISTRESS. RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE FOR PICTURE BOOKS THAT ADDRESS ISSUES OF SEPARATION AND DEATH, WAR AND HUMAN CONFLICT, AND NATURAL DISASTER. CHILDREN WHO ARE SUFFERING EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, AS WELL AS THEIR SYMPATHETIC CLASSMATES, MIGHT BENEFIT FROM DISCUSSIONS INSPIRED BY SENSITIVELY CONSTRUCTED PICTURE BOOKS. <p> In their efforts to focus student attention on academic achievement, educators aim to prepare classrooms as sheltered spaces where children may work undisturbed by the woes of the world beyond the schoolyard walls. Yet, however diligently educators may strive to prohibit worldly sorrows, disappointment and misfortune will spill into classrooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn. Unhappiness adversely affects a student 's ability to focus attention on instruction, and it impedes retention of information( Goleman, 1995). Because visual and audible rhythms and sensitively constructed narratives have been found to have calming, therapeutic affects on emotional suffering, picture books may be particularly helpful resources for reassuring emotionally distressed children and redirecting their attentions back to classroom instruction. THE AESTHETICS OF SORROW <p> The notion of the picture book as potential agent of emotional healing is grounded in an understanding of emotionally painful experiences as characteristically similar to aesthetic experiences( Csikszentmihalyi, 1997). Csikszentmihalyi describes the aesthetic experience as unfolding in a sequenced order. A sensory stimulus triggers a powerful emotional response, which compels one to pose fundamental questions : " What does this mean? " " Why did this happen? " and " What do I do now? " If one can put attention to work ordering and making sense of the triggering event, one may ultimately arrive at a sense of resolution or of being somehow qualitatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, curiosity is stimulated and learning occurs( Manifold, 2005). Picture books may play a role in this process, given that art images draw on feelings, abstract memories, and metaphoric associations whereas narratives spark the reader 's imagination to weave explanation and meaning. Images with narratives become tools of imaginative thinking in guiding young readers through and out of sorrow. STRATEGIES OF IMAGINATION <p> Egan 's stages of imagination( 1997,2005) present a framework for making sense of emotionally painful experiences. Egan understands imaginative thought as the sine qua non of meaning making and argues that imagination awakens in evolutionary stages as somatic, mythic, romantic, philosophic, and ironic thought. From early somatic through mythic stages, the specialized cognitive abilities that contribute to meaning making and learning include( a) response to rhythm as a means of finding attunement with the natural world and with an intimate community ;( b) using metaphor as a bridging of abstract and logical thinking ; and( c) developing narrative as ordering, organizing, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time, space, and things. <p> Egan describes romantic thinking as the imaginative process used by elementary and middle school students between the ages of 7 and 14 to make sense of the world. During the romantic stage, children organize knowledge as narratives bound by binary opposites, such as good and bad or life and death. As romantic thinkers mature, these stories grow increasingly complex with multiple subplots and layered meanings. There is a need to explore extremes and depths of these opposites and to list, collect, and catalogue in minute detail the ground between opposing polarities. There is a sense of awe, wonder, and curiosity about what lies at the parameters of the ordinary ; these give clues to how the world works. The romantic imagination wonders how pieces of the world fit together. Puzzles, riddles, and metaphysical conundrums compel a pitting of wits against the logical universe ; to solve a puzzle is to see the universe as within grasp. <p> Youth beyond early adolescence are capable of engaging philosophic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier stages, deeper and more complex understandings of the universe are sought. Dualistic distinctions and parameters are challenged and collapsed onto an ambiguous ground. The philosophic thinker searches beneath the surfaces of ideas and phenomena for subtleties and complexities ; he or she entertains multiple interpretations and seeks to know the viewpoint of others. Eventually, philosophic imagination may lead to an acceptance of the ultimate irony -- that secrets of the universe may never be known, yet life has meaning within this mystery. THE HEALING POWERS OF IMAGINATION AND PICTURE BOOKS <p> When a person encounters a deeply stressful situation, regardless of the imaginative developmental stage that he or she might normally be in, the human instinct is to call on the early, deeply rooted somatic and mythic tools of visual rhythm and metaphoric synesthesia to regain harmony with the world ; for example, an injured child may rock herself to internalize comfort. The most sensitively composed picture books allow narratives to unfold slowly in a rhythmic fashion similar to this physical motion or to the gentle cadence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and other meaning-making processes associated with somatic and mythic stages of imaginative work. Picture stories also may deal with life problems in ways that alternately highlight, then soften the romantic boundaries between dualistic opposites of good and bad, thus preparing a space between polarities that might be explored. The most sensitively designed books stimulate philosophic or ironic modes of imaginative thought in ways that can be appreciated by readers of all ages and in all the developmental stages described by Egan. SELECTING APPROPRIATE PICTURE BOOKS <p> Words and images of a thoughtfully composed book are woven in ways that lead readers along narrow paths toward an author 's notion of how that universal question that has been posed by the narrative tale might be resolved. Readers do not need to attend critically to details and nuances of the visual tale, because the imaginative mind responds intuitively to subtle rhythmic, metaphoric, and narrative cues as it is swept along toward the story 's finale. For this reason, parents, teachers, and teacher-librarians who share picture books with students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrator provide. If picture books are to elicit the calming and healing effects of imagination, it is important that the answer proposed by the author and illustrator <p> -- treat the universal question with dignity ; <p> -- take an ecumenical approach to the answer ; <p> -- avoid presenting the answer as an absolute certainty, thereby allowing room for a reader 's imaginative interpretation ; and <p> -- carefully balance and harmonize the book 's imagery with its narrative text in a dance of synesthesia. <p> Because readers do not need to critically consider the interplay of image and texts to experience the messages of picture books, making therapeutic picture books available to all children as reading choices in the school library setting would allow any anxious child to explore personally painful topics in a private way. However, when it is known that a particular child is in emotional distress, teachers might be encouraged to engage the entire class indirectly in discussions of the stressful issue through the mediation of picture books. Children should be drawn to notice details of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Children in the romantic stage of imaginative development might be particularly responsive to comparing visual elements of extreme contrast, such as gently expressive facial features set against harsh colors or shapes. Attention might also be drawn to dreamy visual sequences that mirror the poetic consonance or alliterative rhythm of text, deeply toned or sharply outlined forms used as visual onomatopoeia, or stunningly beautiful images used to describe sorrowful emotions or events. Such close attention to detail permits the viewer/reader to identify with the story, project his emotional feelings and responses outward, consider these feelings intellectually, and reprocess them in an ordered way. Both the suffering child and her classmates may benefit as each is led to more empathetic understanding of self and others through the mediation of the picture book. PICTURE BOOKS ABOUT SEPARATION AND DEATH <p> When death separates a child from a loved one, in the child 's despairing loneliness, she may wonder, Where does the life essence of the loved one go? How might the chasm of separation be spanned and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love and who will love me now that my beloved is gone? The beautifully illustrated Carmine the Crow( Holder, 1992) and An Angel for Solomon Singer( Rylant, 1992) suggest passage into death as a subtle dreamlike refocusing of attention from unhappiness to a state of awakened joy and beauty. These are comforting images for the child whose loved one suffered before death. The Moon Quilt( Warner, 2001) presents the subtle transition to death as one that occurs at the completion of a full and happy life. However, because these stories focus on the experience of death as a gentle conclusion to life, they offer no explanation for lives cut short, nor do they suggest how those left behind might address feelings of loss and separation. These issues are addressed in books such as A Pillow for My Mom( Sgouros, 1998), which looks at a child 's loss of her young mother ; Abuelita 's Paradise( Nodar, 1992), which suggests how one may remember the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( Fraustino, 2001), which reassures the continuance of love long after death. These books are appropriate for younger children. Granddad 's Prayers of the Earth( Wood, 1999), Waiting to Sing( Kaplan, 2000), and Through the Mickle Woods( Gregory, 1992) are works that call on philosophic and iconic imagination and, therefore, might comfort older children. <p> Children who are temporarily separated from a parent may wonder if they are still loved. Zolotow( 2002) and Vitale( illustrator) address this topic in the gentle storybook If You Listen. Temporary separation also is tenderly addressed in Coming on Home Soon( Woodson, 2004) and the painfully beautiful Always My Dad( Wyeth, 1994). The exquisite mood picture-poetry of My Men Blue( Grimes, 1999) is told in the voice of a fatherless boy. To children who have been abandoned or have never known a biological parent, the story offers hope that a caring adult might love them. These visual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who long to be reunited with absent parents. As such, they challenge children 's romantic notions of what family life should or should not be. Although these stories do not pretend that the pain of missing or longing for a parent might be removed, they guide children to a philosophic acceptance of love under less-than-ideal circumstances. <p> The loss of a beloved pet may be traumatic for students and, for many children, may represent a first experience with death. Among the more sensitively developed books dealing with this topic are I 'll Always Love You( Wilhelm, 1990) and Viorst( 1971) and Blegvad 's( illustrator) classic work The Tenth Good Thing About Barney. Children also may deeply mourn the loss of familiar places and things. What You Know First( MacLachlan, 1995), My Name Is Yoon( Recorvits, 2003), and In the Small, Small Night( Kurtz, 2005) remind us that self-identity is embedded in environment, culture, and language. Many children of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self that might be comforted in knowing that others have suffered similarly and found resolution. <p> Sky Sash So Blue( Hathorn, 1998) sets its story against the backdrop of 19th-century slavery. Yet, older elementary school readers may recognize this as having metaphorical significance. Sorrow may be a kind of enslavement, and the unsympathetic mistress of this tale may be an analogy of the indifferent world beyond one 's intimate local community. Children of the romantic stage who explore the book may -- with guidance from a caring adult, parent, teacher, or teacher-librarian -- come to understand the blue sash as a symbol of secretly held hopes, dreams, and wishes that might one day come true, not by magic outside of self, but through human efforts to bring them into being. PICTURE BOOKS ABOUT WAR AND HUMAN CONFLICT <p> War is especially problematic as a topic of classroom discussion, given that even within a single classroom or community, children and their parents may hold different points of view about the correctness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagree about how wars should be initiated or played out. In some instances, a parent or member of the extended family of a child may be involved in combat. Therefore, educators should be aware of the degree to which children within a given classroom might be personally affected by conflict, before initiating classroom discussions of the topic. The views expressed must quiet, not increase the fears and concerns of children about war ; however, the conversation must not sugarcoat the cruelties of human conflict. <p> Although as educators we hope that our students will never experience war firsthand or come to harm from its effects, it is important that schoolchildren be sympathetic to the suffering of those who have experienced such tumult. Through powerful narratives and understated imagery or through poetic descriptions of small details that serve as metaphors for overwhelming realities, books such as Sami and the Time of the Troubles( Heide &; Gilliland, 1995), The Roses in My Carpets( Kahn, 1998), and I Never Sow Another Butterfly : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1942-1944( Volavkova, 1994) deal with the awful consequences of war. Yet, these stories do answer the question of why or how people come to inflict such suffering on one another. <p> Like most adults, children are helpless to resolve the complex issues that escalate to war, incapable of processing the irrationality of war, and bewildered by the magnitude of suffering that war produces. They might, however, be led to recognize the genesis of all conflict and war as residing in individual decisions. Through somber colors that mirror the heartbreaking message of Terrible Things : An Allegory of the Holocaust( Bunting, 1989), young and old readers are led to see that the seeds of war lie in a lack of caring or concern for others. The wordless picture book Why?( Popov, 1998), lushly illustrated Feathers and Fools( Fox, 2000), and child-centered I am I( Fitzpatrick, 2006) appeal to romantic imaginations and, through analogy, suggest how extremes of violent behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and intolerance. Picture stories that project ideals of acceptance, forgiveness, and compassion may empower children to see how reversals of injustice and intolerance defuse conflicts. Extraordinary works that present these concepts include The Other Side( Woodson, 2001), Henry and the Kite Dragon( Hall, 2004), and the subtle fairytale The Tomten and the Fox( Lindgren, 1997). Finally, the deeply moving yet gently told tale The Rag Coat( Mills, 1991) demonstrates how integrally the stories of our own lives and sorrows are intertwined with the lives of others in ways that bind us into community. Children may be guided to understand that when we hurt another, we wound ourselves. PICTURE BOOKS ABOUT NATURAL DISASTERS <p> Natural disasters, from earthquake, fire, wind, and flood, are inevitable aspects of the earth 's changes and, as such, are beyond the power of humans to contain or control. Children must be prepared to accept that catastrophic events are woven into the history of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Great Flood, Noah 's Ark( 1977), which unfolds almost entirely through imagery, tells the store of an ancient, globally experienced calamity. Although Spier visually suggests war as the cause of the flood, there is room for the reader to ponder and imagine cause and effect, while repetitive motifs of animals, gathered into pairs of two by two, comfort the disrupted senses of a frightened child. Pinkney 's more recent version of the story Noah 's Ark( 2002) relies on exquisite visual texture to convey a similarly calming effect. Stories of the Flood( Krishnaswami, 1994) presents nine variants of the legendary event as recalled by cultures around the world. Each offers a somewhat different explanation for the cause of the Great Flood, thus leaving the definitive cause of global disaster unresolved. However, every version of the story describes an aftermath of renewed order. <p> Because those who suffer during natural disasters wonder why this misfortune has befallen them and because some myths suggest that such things occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents, teachers, and teacher-librarians help children understand that catastrophes can and do happen to anyone, including to those who have done nothing to warrant suffering. Although people can avert certain kinds of natural disasters by respecting the ecological balance of the earth, as is suggested by Shearer 's Praying Flute : Song of the forth Mother( 2004), cataclysms of earth, fire, wind, and water are cyclical, impersonal, and pay no respect to the innocence or righteousness of the people they affect. Picture books that provide soothing visuals and rhythmic beats combined with reordering mythic motifs may be helpful in calming children 's fears of devastation. Besides Shearer 's book, examples of calmative tales include Oughton( 1996) and Desimini 's( illustrator) How the Stars Fell Into the Sky : A Navajo Legend. Storm in the Night( Stoltz, 1990) quells younger children 's fears through a visual narrative of generational continuity melded by onomatopoeic verse and nocturnal color tones. Also, books that present allusions to recurring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mouse( Barbey, 2005) relates a transformative tale that repeats in an endless loop that may be recognized as a metaphor for cyclical change. <p> Children in the romantic stage of imaginative thinking might need direct analogies to their personal experiences, because experiences of trauma would contrast sharply with their emerging senses of justice. The Fire( Griessman, 2005) relates the story of a house fire from a child 's point of view. The softly focused faces of a terrified sister and brother are contrasted against dark smoke and the menacing colors of a furious blaze. This appositional visual effect may reinforce the reader 's awareness that great loss sometimes befalls the innocent. Without resolving the conundrum question of why, the story ends with reassurance that, so long as people cling together, lives may be mended. Similar themes run through several books dealing with survival from floods. Kurtz( 2000) and Brennan 's( illustrator) unfolding poetic story River Friendly, River Wild, the muted imagery and powerfully understated lyricism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of excited and crowded images With flowing text in Nora 's Ark( Kinsey-Warnock, 2005) all present messages about the value of life over possessions. Yet, these books also downplay the fact that people 's lives may be lost as a result of natural events. Tsunami : Helping Each Other( Morris &; Larson, 2005) is a stark photo essay of how the lives of two young boys were changed forever by the Southeast Asian tsunami of 2004. Once again, the author and illustrator describe how a community comes together to address the wounds of broken families, and readers must reach beyond notions of ideal justice and simplistic rationales of good and evil to come to terms with the capriciousness of nature 's wrath and irrevocability of death. <p> Finally, although the terminal illness that the protagonist of Sadako( Coerr, 1997) faces was brought about by human-induced nuclear holocaust, its inevitability, like that of all natural events, can not be averted. Nevertheless, through powerful imagery and text, readers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inexorable tragedy. THE HEALING AESTHETIC OF SORROW <p> Sorrow is an emotion that can not be avoided and should not be ignored, Because the intense emotions that result from trauma or misfortune have characteristics similar to dimensions of aesthetic experiences, sorrow that is properly addressed can resolve in learning, and the imaginative mind may lift the sufferer to profound understanding. The deepest levels of imaginative understanding make meaning of the world through image, visual and linguistic rhythm, metaphor, and simple narrative. These tools, which children use to reweave psychological places of safety amid chaos, are the stuff of picture books. <p> As the imagination unfolds, it considers increasingly complex narratives and reaches beyond its fascination with extreme oppositions to comprehend ambiguities and mysteries that are beyond logical explanation. Eventually, philosophic imagination may lead to an acceptance of the ultimate irony that ordered meaning is born of chaotic mystery. Carefully constructed picture books, which attend to the imagination not only in form but also in sensitively considered philosophic content, may guide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences. Yet, these literary tools should not be reserved for the suffering child. They should be shared with and discussed among all of the student 's classmates. In this way, children may be guided to feel and act with empathetic compassion toward one another. Then, having cairned the suffering child and brought the child into the caring community of learners, the attentions of students may be refocused on tasks of academic learning.
