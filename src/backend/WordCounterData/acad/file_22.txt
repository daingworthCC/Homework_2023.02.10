4003141 Section : Editorial 18 <p> According to reports, after the careful solicitation of all kinds of opinions, the department of interior affairs has invited relevant agencies and scholars and formed a special committee. The revision draft of the law of welfare for disabled people will be started soon. It clearly regulates that state-run businesses should contribute to the welfare of disabled people at a ratio of 3 percent. Agencies that surpass this ratio will be praised, whereas those below the ratio will be required to compensate. The government will establish a welfare fund for the disabled, with money to be used specifically. The main officials in the department of interior affairs have pointed out that since the implementation of this law in June 1980, various responses have been evoked. The rapid change of society has outdated some of the statutes in the law and it is necessary that it be revised. First, the opinions of relevant agencies and people with various social backgrounds were sought. Then the managers of relevant agencies, the representatives of public opinions, experts and scholars, and the persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting. Now, all the preparatory work has been finished. The social bureau in the department of interior affairs has included such crucial points as expanding the range and type of disability to be included, considering facial injuries as disability, and regulating clearly the welfare-fee ratio between different levels of government. <p> We feel very glad that the department of interior affairs has brought out this revised draft with timeliness. At the same time, it can be receptive to all kinds of opinion, according to the principle of eclecticism. After having been demanded for over thirteen years, the law of welfare for disabled people was finally implemented in June 1980. However, many flaws in this law still need correction. Moreover, there is a shortage of funds. In all areas of society, including the governmental agencies, people have not shown enough respect for our disabled fellow countrymen. Much good will in the law has not been realized in reality. In recent years, we can frequently see disabled people being denied jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society. <p> The current law concerning disability has included visual, listening, and balancing disabilities. It also covers vocal or linguistic malfunction, physical deficiency, intellectual disability, complex disability, and other types that have been ratified by the central agency in charge of the issue. In our country, mental disability and facial injury are not included in the law of welfare for disabled people, and therefore many people who need help have been excluded from the protection of the law. This is one of the weaknesses of the disability welfare law. The department of interior affairs is planning to count facial injury as a disability, a progressive action. We believe that mentally disabled people( with serious mental diseases) in this industrial society, increasing in number, should also enjoy reasonable protection. <p> The content of our disability welfare law is very substantial, with regulations on the employment, education, medical care, and rehabilitation of disabled people. However, it lacks the cooperation of society. This has reduced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sufferings of the disabled people. The families of disabled people have spent huge amounts of energy and time on their unfortunate members. This may not be known to others. In a progressive and modernized nation, the government and the people have the obligation of helping the disabled with collective power to overcome some of their weaknesses and become active members of society. Therefore, it is extremely necessary to offer basic assistance to our disabled people. We have a disability welfare law, but a skillful wife can not cook without rice. All the agencies are limited in funding, and the real help they can offer to the disabled people is very limited. As we know, due to the limited help from the government and the society, more than half of the disabled people and their families have not registered with the relevant government agency or applied for assistance. Therefore, what the government knows about disabled people, their number, and their needs is insufficient, not to mention other welfare policies. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been implemented. For example, the twelfth article says " the government should set in public buildings and other places of activities the equipment for disabled people. " If we go to the developed countries of Europe, America, or Japan, we will see that the governments there have implemented those regulations in reality. There are very careful considerations for disabled people in public buildings, offering them freedom of moving around. In comparison, although we also have similar regulations in our country, they have not been implemented. This is also protested by many people who care about the disabled. This time, the department of interior affairs plans to regulate clearly the ratio of disabled welfare fees between different levels of governments. This is a correct and timely action. We have laws but not the experience of implementing them. This explains why it is not easy to implement welfare in our country. <p> Job opportunities for disabled people are one of the main points of the disabled welfare law. The seventeenth article of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disabled people by public or private organizations. However, there is not enough love for the disabled people in the society and the regulation has not been realized. Job opportunities for disabled people have not been protected, and sometimes the disabled may even face obstructions that are more serious. Last year the central bank once refused to hire a disabled person who had passed the college entrance exam and been assigned to the bank. Another time it refused to allow a disabled person to take the membership exam of the central bank. Recently, the dispute over whether to accept disabled people as justices has become another vivid example. If the government can not be an example, how can it expect the private companies to follow? We consider it necessary for the personnel department of the government to form a special committee and completely set the regulations for the employment of governmental agencies. It should regulate what kind of job is not suitable to disabled people and what kind of job is not allowed to have restrictions. Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give disabled people priority in employment, based on the fortes of the disabled. Thus, job opportunities can be provided to the disabled, and limitations in other jobs can be compensated. After the government has done this, the private businesses may follow suit or relevant laws may be established. Otherwise, even if there is a law, it can not be implemented. We hope that the department of interior affairs will consider the above principles and cooperate with the personnel department to make the law concerning the employment of disabled people as soon as possible. <p>
