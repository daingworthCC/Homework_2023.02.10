4003441 This paper is a report from the field rather than the result of formal research into comparative education. For the academic years 1995-1998 I, an American medievalist, have been teaching European and American history at the European Humanities University in Minsk, Belarus. For the last two years, I have done so through the auspices of the Civic Education Project, an international voluntary educational organization that places western-trained lecturers in partner universities in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe. My students and I rapidly discovered that we had very different assumptions about the purpose and methods of university teaching and student evaluation, and we have both learned a great deal from our mutual culture shock. <p> One of my senior students asked me once how Belarusian students were different from American students, and I replied that to some extent students everywhere were the same : some come regularly to class and some do n't ; some do the reading and some do n't ; some work steadily through the semester and others try to learn everything in the last week before the exam. Every country has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are produced by a mixture of different abilities and levels of motivation. This is all I said to my student. However, I have noticed some real differences differences in learning styles, which I think have been produced by radical differences in teaching styles. In a traditional post-Soviet university classroom, as I have been informed by numerous students and professors in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine, professors read lectures, students copy them down word for word as much as possible, memorize them, and then repeat them to the professors at oral exams. Students avoid asking questions in order not to be made to look like a fool. While senior students may take seminars involving class discussion and research papers, first and second year students generally do not speak in class or do independent writing. <p> This is quite different from the usual style for the social sciences and humanities in the United States, where factual content is conveyed as much through assigned reading as through lectures, even introductory courses normally involve some discussion, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all advanced courses in the humanities or social sciences, and students are tested by written exams which include, or even consist of, analytical essay questions. Even in large lecture courses at large universities, professors normally answer questions, and discussion sessions led by teaching assistants allow some discussion. While some students are quieter than others, and naturally students who have n't done the reading tend to sit at the back and not volunteer, an invitation to ask questions in an American university classroom usually produces questions. <p> I have appreciated one advantage of the traditional system in Belarus, namely that Belarusian undergraduates seem far more willing and able to memorize facts than American undergraduates. When I have provided a study sheet of names and dates which will be covered on an exam, even many of my worst students in Belarus memorized it ; in the United States only the better undergraduates would do so. Some American students will refuse to learn any facts unless they are presented as dramatically as possible ; unless the professor, in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States, " behaves like an actor. " In fact I do try in my lectures to " behave like an actor " in both Belarus and the United States, but for different reasons. In Belarus I use exaggerated expressions and gestures to make it easier for non-native speakers of English to understand what I 'm saying. In the United States I do it to force the students to pay attention and actually learn a few facts. <p> In my own field of history, names and dates are the basic building blocks of knowledge ; one can not analyze or theorize successfully about the past without first making some attempt to learn at least the bare outlines of what actually happened. On the other hand, these facts are useless and irrelevant until they are arranged and interpreted : until they are used to understand what happened, how human societies have been and can be organized, and the interaction between politics, economics, social organization, religion, literature, and art. It is here that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greater advantage. <p> Students do not learn critical thinking or communication skills from listening to and regurgitating lectures ; more active learning methods are needed. Active learning methods include but are not limited to class discussion, interpretive essays, and research papers. However, critical and independent thought can also be encouraged by the choice of material taught. Fortunately, all of these methods are available even to faculty working with the limited resources of a post-Soviet university ; they do not require computers or audio-visual equipment. Over the course of two years ' teaching in Belarus, I have found myself making more and more of an effort to involve my students in active learning situations requiring critical thought, through class discussion, written assignments, and the choice of material ; and these efforts have met with increasing success. CLASS DISCUSSION <p> In Belarus, more than in the U.S., I have found it very difficult to get each new group of students to speak in class, or even to ask questions. Yet speaking in class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organize and articulate their thoughts ; and those abilities, in turn, affect their later job potential, whether they remain in academia or work in business or one of the professions. Their reluctance is not due to lack of intellectual curiosity ; I have had some very bright students in Belarus, and some of them have come up after class to ask the questions they were too shy to ask during class. Nor is the students ' reluctance to speak up in class only due to the obvious difficulty of speaking in a foreign language. Belarusian and Russian colleagues who attempt to use active learning methods have told me that they also have difficulty in getting students to speak up in class. The students themselves have told me, when I urged them to ask questions in class, that " this is not our custom. " <p> This custom has not changed much in recent years, even at universities with a relatively high level of international cooperation. A recent study of social science teaching at central and east European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the professors ' participation in international conferences or study abroad, nor the presence of western lecturers -- had yet had any measurable positive effect on teaching methods that give students an opportunity to participate actively in learning, such as question and answer exercises, in-class discussion, laboratory exercises, role playing, or case studies. Even teacher training workshops produced more changes in course content than in teaching methods(n2) <p> In spring of 1997 I taught a course that was a fairly radical departure from the usual teaching methods in this part of the world. The course, called " Readings in American Historical Documents " involved the students ' required weekly readings in original documents in American history. I was able to provide the fourteen students with individual textbooks( itself a novelty in Belarus) through the generosity of the United States Information Service, which provided copies of its Basic Readings in U.S. Democracy free of charge.( n3) Since the book did not cover all the topics I wished to cover, I supplemented this text with photocopies from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( n4) During class time, I provided a brief historical background, and the students then analyzed the documents in detail. Seventy percent of the grade was based on their classroom participation, and the remaining thirty percent was based on a written exam which included both objective and analytical questions. Needless to say this was very strange for the students. I tried to make it less so both by the American custom of providing a syllabus or written document explaining the class requirements, schedule of class topics, and the grading system, and by explaining the purpose and methods of the course verbally. <p> How did I get students to participate in this class when " it is not our custom "? For the first half of the semester I had to remind the students repeatedly that every student was expected to speak in every class ; even if they did not have a comment to make, they should at least be prepared with a question. I was very open about my evaluation process, telling them that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was present, who spoke at least once, and who either spoke often or else made an unusually insightful or analytical comment, without making any notes about which students took what point of view. Being open about the evaluation process is crucial. While professors ' teaching strategies will depend on the content and skills they wish to convey, students ' learning strategies will depend on how they expect to be evaluated. If students in Belarus have a phenomenal ability to memorize and regurgitate set facts and set opinions, this is due to the fact that their academic performance has depended on their ability to do precisely that. Students are most likely to make the effort to learn different skills, such as critical thinking and communication skills, if they understand that their progress in this area, too, will be evaluated. In my first semester of teaching in Belarus, I did not understand how strange my methods of evaluation, none of which were in the least revolutionary in an American context, appeared to my students. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students from the beginning, orally as well as in the syllabus( since they are not accustomed to receiving a syllabus), exactly how their grades will be determined, and how that relates to what we do in class. <p> To break the ice, I began every discussion with an activity in which even the less sophisticated students could participate : asking questions about the meanings of words or phrases. Often an explanation of the more difficult or colloquial words, which did not appear in the students ' dictionaries, led directly into a substantive discussion of issues. I then asked students for their general reactions. Sometimes this open-ended question produced unexpected or in, sightful remarks, as when students commented on Lincoln 's magnanimity to the South in the Gettysburg Address. Often, however, an open-ended question produced only silence. I had more success asking specific questions about what the text has to say, and then what the significance of that was. Most often, class discussion moved from what words meant, to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did. <p> Over the course of the semester, the students ' performance improved with practice. In the first class only 60% of the class spoke at all, even to ask a question, and no one made a really substantive comment or spoke several times. By the third class session, nearly 80% of the class spoke at least once, and some were beginning to make insightful or analytical comments beyond the basic vocabulary questions and document summaries. For the second half of the course, all but one or two students in every class made some contribution, and a few students who at the beginning never spoke began to offer substantive comments as well as asking questions. It is worth emphasizing that most of the students in this class were secondyear students and none were history majors ; it is not necessary to limit class discussion to advanced students even in eastern Europe. WRITTEN ASSIGNMENTS <p> Even when the main purpose of the course is to convey a large body of knowledge, so that more of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, students ' ability to think independently and critically can be fostered through written work. Independent written work is a normal part of a university-level history class in the United States, Canada or western Europe. Students are expected to produce either one or more short interpretative essays or a longer research paper. This is most often in addition to, not instead of, a written examination which consists either wholly or in part of written essay questions. <p> Unfortunately this kind of writing assignment is relatively rare in Eastern Europe. A recent study found that although either the presence of western visiting lecturers or a high level of professors ' attendance at international conferences caused East European social science departments to assign students more written work, nevertheless overall East European social science undergraduates were assigned essays in less than 1 out of 4 courses and required to write research papers in only 1 out of 5 courses.( n5) The background for the low number of written assignments, at least in Belarus, is the high number of courses required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive a recognized diploma. While students in the United States normally do not take more than 4 to 6 courses per semester, students in Belarus might take 10 or 11 courses at a time. Faculty work loads are also different. While non-adjunct American faculty rarely teach more than three or at most four courses per semester, many Belarusian professors teach more than twice that many courses at their primary university.( n6) Furthermore, due to the difficult economic situation, even faculty with a full-time job at one university usually teach extra courses for extra pay at other universities. While I have not had to work at more than one university, students ' workloads have meant that I am not able to assign nearly as much work outside class as I normally would in the United States. <p> Yet the educational value of independent written work can hardly be overestimated. The value of longer research papers in developing students ' abilities to work independently, think critically, and express themselves clearly, is fairly obvious. Both Belarusian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect to continue academic work at the graduate level. In most American universities, however, some research papers are assigned even to first-year students, and therefore the better American high schools( though unfortunately not all) provide some training in writing such papers. My students in Belarus have not received such training, and indeed some asked me to teach a course in Academic Writing, even though this extra course would be a heavy addition to their already heavy load. <p> I have not assigned long research papers in the history and art history courses I have taught in Belarus, partly because I do not have the Russian language ability to check their sources and make sure they are not plagiarizing, and partly because I know the students are taking so many other classes. An additional problem is the fact that most post-Soviet libraries are not well equipped for research papers in American or west European history ; prior to 1989 books had to pass an ideological test, and since then the acquisition budget for foreign books has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essays in lecture courses in which students were not otherwise required to express their own opinions. I have usually assigned short interpretative essays based on students ' choice of a single long reading from original source material. The questions they were given to answer required some independent analysis, rather than just summarizing the reading. Some students rose to the occasion, read the material critically, and presented their own opinion in a way which differentiated carefully between fact and opinion. Some unfortunately ignored the question and merely summarized the work they had been given to read, or even plagiarized published work. Most, however, fell somewhere in between ; typically, they had not read the material very critically, but made some effort to offer their own opinions. <p> Even when these opinions were naive and uncritical, they had educational value, since they represented the beginnings of independent thought applied to the material. A Belarusian who did graduate study in educational methods in the United States told me that his favorite professor there had been one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of independent thought, " even when these first efforts were naive or weak, rather than attacking or humiliating the students. This encouraged students to make further attempts at independent thought, with the result that later efforts were less naive. <p> In the discussion course Readings in American Historical Documents, I did not assign an essay based on a single long document, as the students were already reading so many. Instead, I had them write an essay question as part of their exam. In order to prevent simple repetition of class discussion or summary of documents by my skilled memorizers, all the essay questions from which they could choose required students to draw on material from at least three different class sessions.( n7) I passed out the questions and explained what was expected three weeks in advance, to give time for reflection, but did not allow the students to bring written notes to class, in order to prevent cheating. These techniques worked very well. No students cheated, and every student cited documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few students merely cited two documents as illustrating the principles found in a third, more than half engaged in some real comparison, and the best produced thoughtful, well-supported essays. <p> Several groups are trying to compensate for the relative lack of writing experience among east European university students by sponsoring student conferences. The American Studies Association of Belarus sponsored a student conference in May 1997, in which more than twenty students delivered academic papers to a jury ; the best were awarded book prizes. The Civic Education Project regularly sponsors country-wide or regional student conferences on post-Soviet society, including an annual international student conference in Budapest. Students from a variety of social science disciplines write and present papers, and a few of the best are published. While preparing these papers is a lot of extra work for students who already carry a heavy load, many students have told me that participation in Civic Education Project conferences was a high point in their intellectual development. CHOICE OF MATERIAL <p> In addition to class discussion and independent written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the choice of material taught. Some might wonder how choice of course content is relevant to a discussion of teaching methods. In practice, I think there is a very clear relationship between the skills we seek to impart, the methods we use in teaching, and the material we choose to teach. Certainly in my own field of history, the most difficult question to decide in designing a course is what material, from the vast sum of the totality of human learning, will be included. If you are teaching a history survey covering several countries over several centuries, most of what actually happened will have to be left out. The choice of what tiny fraction of this vast sum of knowledge to include reflects what the professor considers important. For example, if your world view says that only wealth and power are important, you will teach the history only of political and economic elites, and ignore social or cultural history or the history of the less powerful. If you teach the history only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the message is that women are not human. If you teach the history only of western Europe and America and label it " world history, " as was sometimes done in the United States when I was a schoolgirl, you are saying that the rest of the world does not matter. <p> Students are most likely to do the difficult work of becoming intellectually involved with a historical issue when the professor is able to select issues which in some way parallel students ' current concerns, so that they want to think and discuss. For example, in teaching the conflict between pope and emperor in medieval western Europe, a conflict which has many facets, I have chosen in Belarus to focus on the fact that neither pope nor emperor gained absolute power over the other, and that both sides developed theories of resistance to unjust use of power. Both these facts were crucial to the development of western concepts of democracy, and thus are relevant to post-Soviet society. Similarly, when selecting readings in American history I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform movements, Horace Mann 's arguments about the value of public schools for civic education. This was obviously relevant to students at a non-state university in a newly independent state, and I was rewarded for my choice when the class discussion on this topic was one the liveliest and most substantive we had. <p> What is less obvious is that the choice of what material to present is also directly relevant to the question of what skills we seek to impart. Analytical thought is best taught when the course material presents more than one point of view. It is not enough to simply say " bad people did bad things ; good people did good things ; " the self-justifications of the different sides of a conflict must be presented. For example, in teaching the crusades, I teach the students both the theological justification and inspiration for the crusades and the pogroms and bloodshed that resulted. In my course on American historical documents, the documents on westward expansion included both an editorial advising western settlement as a way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and appeals from Native Americans against the settlers ' violation of their personal and property rights. <p> In practice, this last topic proved one of the more difficult discussions to lead. The students, having identified President Andrew Jackson 's violation of the Supreme Court ruling in favor of the Cherokees with their own President Lukashenko 's violation of the Belarusian Constitutional Court 's rulings, saw westward settlement solely as a Bad Thing. They could not understand how westward settlement could possibly be seen as a way of broadening opportunity for the downtrodden, and were reluctant to consider the argument of the editorial Vote Yourself a Farm. Yet a few weeks later, when westward settlement was discussed again in the context of the rise of European immigration and Emma Lazarus ' poem The New Colossus, westward settlement was a Good Thing ; not one student brought up the issue of dispossession of native Americans. These difficulties confirmed for me how necessary it was for the students ' intellectual growth to present different points of view. IDEOLOGY AND HISTORY <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) tend to accept whatever they read uncritically, the professor needs to set an example by demonstrating how to read to a document critically. However, this can lead to another problem in teaching independent critical thought : the tendency of students to accept, or pretend to accept, the professor 's point of view. This seems far more common among my Belarusian students than among American students. I have used two methods to try to combat the problem. First, I have been explicit about my marking system to the students : that after each class, I note down the students ' degree of participation, but not what they said. In other words, I was not looking for a particular interpretation, but for intellectual engagement with the ideas and situations presented. My second tool has been to point out omissions and persuasive techniques even in texts the class had agreed to admire, and to discuss why these are present. Examples of two different class discussions from the American Historical Documents course illustrate these points. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Deal and Social Security. I had chosen this topic, despite the fact that it is not covered in Basic Readings in US Democracy, partly because it is an issue which is currently relevant in both the United States and in Belarus, which has an aging population. By the time this subject came up towards the end of the semester, my students were fairly adept at summarizing the point of view of the document, but still preferred to judge every document as either all good or all bad. They could tell from my historical introduction that the New Deal was intended to solve specific and urgent societal problems, and so they summarized the document 's content approvingly. When I then challenged them to discern that Social Security was presented as a savings plan, but was actually a tax-funded social welfare program, students appeared very confused -- I could almost hear them think " Is she for it or against it? " One student however quickly argued that the funding problems of Social Security meant of course it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the student what economic justification President Roosevelt and Frances Perkins had offered for the program, he not only summarized their justification for these programs( that minimum economic security makes a society more stable and therefore provides a better climate for economic growth), but changed his mind a second time and began arguing along New Deal lines himself. It was hard for me to know whether this represented solely a desire to please, or also a genuine effort to grapple with different sides of an issue. <p> Another, somewhat more successful effort at a nuanced historical analysis occurred during our discussion of the Emancipation Proclamation. Obviously both the students and I felt that the Emancipation Proclamation was a Good Thing. However, this simple judgment was very far from a real understanding of the Civil War period. I asked students what attitude the proclamation took toward slave rebellions, and why. As we were attempting to define this precisely, one student suddenly asked what the point of Lincoln 's exhortations to the slaves was, since most slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said, " So why do you think it 's in there? " In our ensuing discussion of southern fears and the course of the civil war, we succeeded finally in reading the document both critically, as careful piece of war propaganda aimed primarily at whites, as well as admiringly, as a step toward realizing the ideal of equality. <p> This discussion, and every discussion in which students showed an ability to separate analysis from judgment, was a breakthrough in a country in which most schools still use textbooks from the Soviet era in which fact is never allowed to interfere with ideology. Knowing the kind of history to which my students have been exposed in the past, I have been particularly careful in my treatment of the relationship between history and ideology. Every thinking person has an ideology, more or less conscious. Yet anyone who wishes to teach students to think independently will need to distinguish clearly between fact and opinion, between events and their interpretation. This means that factual material must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution has been to let my ideology guide my selection of what is worthy of study, though even there I try to measure my judgments against others ', so as not to leave out important topics which do not happen to interest me. My ideology has also guided my choice of teaching methods ; I try to teach independent critical thinking because I believe it is valuable. But once I have chosen the subject and methods, I try to distinguish as clearly as possible between factual material and its interpretation - and most important of all, I try not to simply leave out the uncomfortable facts. <p> I had not realized myself how automatically I, coming out of the western tradition of history teaching, was doing this in my teaching, until one of my students exclaimed with dismay : " We 're used to being told what to think, but you just tell us what happened! " This was not a positive comment for the student who made it ; she found that being expected not only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on her own in an independent essay, very hard. She was confused because I did not provide an ideological structure into which I squeezed all of human history, eliminating everything that did not conform to my beliefs, or pretending that uncomfortable facts did not exist. The same confusion showed up in many of the essays I read ; students often had trouble distinguishing between fact and opinion. This difficulty is of course not limited to Belarusian students ; many American undergraduates, and indeed I suspect all people, have trouble distinguishing between fact and opinion until they are taught. The important thing is that they be taught, and the younger age at which this can begin, the better. <p> Distinguishing between fact and opinion is not the same as having no opinion. My beliefs, my personal ideology, do not include a belief that beliefs themselves are wrong. On the contrary, I think awareness of our own beliefs is essential for understanding both ourselves and our world. One of my beliefs is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this belief is shared by almost all of my Belarusian students. Both from an ideological and a practical point of view, it is crucial to the intellectual development of all people who hope to live in a democratic society to learn the difference between fact and opinion, and to do this they need practice. This ability to distinguish between fact and opinion can and must be fostered in university classrooms. <p>
