4010041 An increased supply of interactive videodisc programs, coupled with the push to integrate technology within the education curriculum, compels educators to examine the components and effects of interactive videodisc technology. A search of the literature reveals a proliferation of articles dealing with the perceived benefits of interactive videodisc instruction as well as a number of research-based studies and reviews. Reports of studies which have been conducted exhibit the focus of researchers primarily on the following questions :( 1) Is learner performance improved through the use of videodisc instruction?( 2) What are learner attitudes toward the use of interactive videodisc instruction : and( 3) Is learning time reduced through the use of interactive videodisc instruction systems? This article examines the three areas( learner performance, learner attitude and learning time) through a review of the empirical studies conducted by researchers in the military, education, and business sectors. <p> Business, industry, and the military have employed interactive videodisc as an instructional strategy for over a decade with reportedly positive results( Debloois &; Woolley, 1981 ; Gibbons, Olsen, &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supply of programs available for the K-12 curriculum is still considered inadequate, vendors are developing new programs aimed at that market in growing numbers( Phillipo, 1988). The increased supply of interactive videodisc programs, coupled with the push to integrate technology within the public school curriculum, compels the educational community to examine the components and effects of interactive videodisc technology. <p> A search of the literature reveals a proliferation of articles dealing with the perceived benefits of interactive videodisc instruction( IVI) as well as a number of research-based studies and reviews. Reports of studies which have been conducted exhibit the focus of researchers primarily on the following questions :( 1) Is learner performance improved through the use of videodisc instruction?( 2) What are learner attitudes toward the use of interactive videodisc instruction? and( 3) Is reaming time reduced through the use of interactive videodisc instructional systems? This article examines the three areas, reamer performance, learner attitude and learning time, through a review of empirical studies conducted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Researchers have investigated interactive videodisc instruction comparing it to traditional instruction as well as comparing selected IVI program components : the effects of added simulations, varying degrees of feedback, methodology, and program content. The early studies were conducted as evaluation segments of military projects. <p> As early as 1979, Holmgren, Dyer Hilligos, and Heller reported on an experimental pilot study of the effectiveness of interactive videodisc on learner performance. This study of 298 military personnel compared the performance results of three groups on Army Training Extension lessons. The control group, receiving traditional instruction, scored significantly higher than the two videodisc groups at the.05 level. However, as is true of many of the early IVI studies, this one has been criticized for the poor quality of the videodisc programs themselves. Additionally, the subjects were not randomly selected nor was a pretest administered( DeBloois, Maki, &; Hall, 1984). <p> A military training program was again used in an experimental study( Gibbons et al., 1982) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control group( n = 16) received traditional classroom instruction. One treatment group( n = 10) used the HAWK Training System lessons on IVI ; the other( n=20) used the same IVI course with an added simulation component. A posttest consisting of one test question revealed that only 25% of the subjects in the control group were able to solve the test question in contrast to 100% of the subjects in the two treatment groups. Moreover, the subjects who received the lessons with the simulation component solved the problem in half the time of the lesson-only group. Based on these results, the researchers concluded that the simulation component has the effect of improving students ' efficiency at problem solving. However, there is some concern that using a posttest containing only one question is not a sufficient indication of IVI 's instructional effectiveness. <p> Students from the U.S. Air Force Academy participated in a study( Verano, 1987) employing the use of a beginning Spanish instructional videodisc, " Zarabanda. " The study focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interaction on reaming performance. Subjects( n=92) were randomly assigned to three treatment groups and a control group. <p> Each of the three treatment groups received instruction using the interactive videodisc with a varying degree of feedback :( 1) passive viewing of the videodisc ;( 2) viewing with minimal feedback ; and( 3) an interactive viewing mode. The control group viewed a videodisc in English totally unrelated to the material shown the other groups. Scores on posttests for the third interactive instruction group( with increased feedback) were significantly higher( p <.01) than all other groups. The researcher concluded that interaction is most likely the factor that accounted for the superior achievement of this group and that the results support the learning theory research on the importance of involving the student in the reaming process. <p> Although the military sector was the first to attempt to measure the effectiveness of IVI, many studies have been conducted by educators in such areas as foreign language, nursing, biology, reading and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams, Quin &; Gale, 1983). These studies involved college and public school students in many disciplines. <p> The use of interactive videodisc instruction in foreign languages was investigated at Brigham Young University by Williams, Quin, and Gale( 1983). Three groups were established :( 1) a control group which viewed the Spanish videotape " Micario " and received a 50-minute lecture ;( 2) a control group which viewed the " Micario " film as many times as they wanted but received no instruction ; and,( 3) a treatment group which viewed the same material in an interactive form. A 100-item pretest determined that the groups were equivalent ; however, the interactive treatment group outperformed the control groups on the posttest of concepts. The researchers concluded that the use of interactive videodisc was an effective instructional strategy for teaching Spanish. <p> Branch, Ledford, Robertson and Robison( 1986) concluded that the use of interactive was effective when compared to traditional techniques in their study involving 87 first-year veterinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilized random assignment of students and a pretest determining that the two groups did not vary significantly. The control group was exposed to audio heart sound recordings as done traditionally ; however, the experimental group was exposed to a videodisc. A multivariate analysis indicated that there was no significant difference( p >.05) between the treatment and control groups ; both forms of instruction, traditional and interactive, were effective. <p> Lawrence and Price( 1985) used videodisc instruction to teach preservice elementary education students the Language Experience Approach( LEA) to teaching reading. This study featured random assignment of students to a control group( n = 18) utilizing traditional instruction and IVI treatment group( n = 18). The Nelson Denny vocabulary and comprehension test was administered revealing no differences in participants ' reading abilities. A teacher-prepared test of 50 recall questions was also administered as a pre- and posttest. The posttest scores indicated no significant difference( p,.05) could be observed between the two groups. The traditional and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEA approach to reading. <p> A number of studies have been conducted employing public school students as subjects and IVI as the instructional strategy. Williams, Quin and Gale( 1983) report on an experimental study involving two classes of high school students using Spanish videodisc instruction. Students were randomly assigned 10 one of three treatments :( 1) an interactive video group in which the students worked individually ;( 2) classroom interactive video in which the students as a group viewed the interactive video ; and( 3) a traditional classroom approach. <p> Students were pretested using the Spanish Modem Language Association( MLA) test with no significant group differences found. The posttest consisted of a Spanish listening comprehension exam. Results showed that both of the interactive videodisc groups scored higher on the outcome test than the traditional group( p <.01). The researchers concluded that interactive videodisc was an effective means of teaching Spanish for this grade level and noted that this medium is also effectively employed as a group teaching strategy. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Hofmeister, Engelmann, and Carnine( 1985) who utilized the Mastering Fractions program for teaching basic fractions. The study involved 40 students( 12 fourth-grade students and 28 remedial and special education students). The total instructional time was the same for both the control and treatment groups ; the program did differ in the delivery medium( one group with videodisc and the other with textbook). <p> Students were given pre-, post- and maintenance tests on basic fractions skills with a significant difference found between treatments on the post- and maintenance tests. An interesting aspect of this study was that data were also collected on the percent of six-second intervals during which students were on task. The results, averaged across five sessions, were 96 percent on-task for the interactive videodisc group, and 84 percent on-task for the basal group. <p> The interactive videodisc program, Mastering Fractions, was also the focus of a research study in the Nashville public schools( Hasselbring, 1986). This two-part study examined the effectiveness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of IVI in a variety of settings. <p> Part 1, examining the program methodology, compared three treatments :( 1) a teacher replication of the Mastering Fractions program using all of the materials but not the videodisc itself ;( 2) the Mastering Fractions videodisc ; and( 3) a traditional teacher presentation using the current fractions curriculum. <p> All students were administered a 69-item pre-post test ; an analysis of covariance showed that the overall gains from pretest to posttest were greater for the Mastering Fractions students and that these students scored higher than did the control group who used the current fractions curriculum. Findings suggested that gains from the use of the Mastering Fractions program can be attributed to instructional content and methodology and not to the novelty effect of the videodisc medium ; further, the Mastering Fractions program was more effective than the existing fractions curriculum. <p> The second part of this evaluation involved examining the effect of the Mastering Fractions videodisc program on student learning in a variety of settings. Participants included 78 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students, and 25 eighth grade students. All the students were given the 69-item pretest developed for the experimental study, mastery tests after every five lessons, and the posttest. Teachers were instructed to use the Mastering Fractions program as outlined in the instructor 's manual and to keep a log describing their use in class. While all students made significant gains in the pre-post analysis, the researchers noted that the largest pre-post gains and percent correct on the posttest were found in classes where all of the 15 Mastering Fractions lessons and tests were completed within an eight-week period. In classes where the use of the program was spread over a longer period of time, the pre-post gains and percent correct on the posttest were much lower. The researchers stated that it is the videodisc medium utilizing sound instructional content and methodology which was effective in producing student gains and not the medium itself. <p> The early studies, which have been criticized for the quality of programs and equipment utilized, did not consistently report interactive videodisc instruction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies have either shown significant gains for students using IVI or reported that although there is not a significant difference between the instructional modes, interactive videodisc is an effective instructional strategy. Learner performance has been the focus of many empirical studies ; however, when evaluating an instruction medium, reamer attitude toward that medium is also a critical assessment component. Effects on Learner Attitude <p> Many of the studies involving IVI examine the attitudes of learners toward the technology itself and enlist learner evaluation of the medium. Learners ' attitudes toward this medium of instruction are usually quite favorable and perhaps the strongest supporting reason for using interactive videodisc instruction( Andriessen &; Kroon, 1980 ; DeBloois &; Woolley, 1981 ; Gibbons, et al., 1982). <p> Feedback from reamers was elicited as a component of an early military study( Gibbons, et al., 1982). The most popular features cited by the subjects were the self-pacing, clarity and understandability of the material, the inherent interest in the system, and the realism of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audio and high degree of reading ; moreover, some of the subjects complained about the quality of the display. However, these dislikes would appear to be more a product of the program itself and not the instructional system. <p> Lawrence and Price( 1985) in their study of the videodisc instruction of the Language Experience Approach to reading reported the favorable attitudes of the students toward the videodisc. Students stated that they enjoyed the feeling of control coupled with the ability to review material at will and return if needed at their own convenience. <p> The Mastering Fractions evaluation studies( Hasselbring, 1986) provided for interviews of participating students and teachers. Teachers reported the positive aspects of the videodisc as a medium which allowed interesting presentation of material, reinforcement, and effectiveness in keeping students on task. <p> When questioned about the negative aspects, teachers felt that students were bored with copying problems from the video screen, the lessons were too long, and the program did not emphasize simplification. When asked how the students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked the program more at the beginning than at the end of the study. However, the teachers indicated that the students now wanted to know when they could use the disc players again. A typical comment which characterized how the teachers felt was : <p> I loved being able to access a disc. The fractions program was well thought out and used sound teaching concepts. The problem is that we " human-type teachers. like to do things our way and we are all different. l would prefer to integrate the use of the disc in with my regular program and not use it in a canned approach( p.30). <p> The student interviews included comments about such positive aspects as the benefits of clear program instructions, good illustrations and animation, and ease of understanding. Negative remarks included comments about there being too many reviews and quizzes. When asked which they prefer as a choice to learn fractions, three-fourths said they would use the Mastering Fractions interactive videodisc program and the remaining said they would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a teacher. Again, as in other surveys, the overall responses were quite positive. <p> There are other descriptive studies which focused primarily on learner attitude toward interactive videodisc instruction. One of the earliest was conducted by Andriessen and Kroon( 1980). Twelve subjects, who spend an average of 55 minutes interacting with a videodisc lesson( Work of the Heart), were observed. The range of time spend on the lessons was 26 minutes to two hours. The subjects were then given a post interview that revealed what they enjoyed about the instructional system :( I) the personal control of the materials,( 2) the ability to repeat segments,( 3) jumping through the material, and( 4) easy rewinding. A negative comment by several subjects was that they missed the social interaction provided by other students and/or a teacher. <p> Nursing students( n = 96) in a study conducted by Lynnes( 1987) identified favorable and unfavorable aspects of the IVI medium. Favorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90%), self-pacing qualities( 59%), and the ability to review and practice( 57%). Unfavorable responses included : the medium was sometimes frustrating( 38%), faults were detected too precisely( 27%), and preference fore live instructor( 25%). <p> An observational study( Merlin, 1987) investigated the use of a prototype interactive videodisc, " Seeing the Unseen, " using a group of 116 middleschool students. Three groups used the videodisc for instruction in whole-class sessions( n = 86), pairs( n = 18), and individually( n = 12). Five instruments were used : observation data sheets, post-use interviews, lesson interviews, student and teacher questionnaires. <p> The students reported that the disc was easy to use, and they welcomed the high level of participation. They emphasized their enjoyment of the TV-like qualities of the medium and the control they had over their reaming. Students found the experience to be beneficial since they could replay segments of the videodisc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupting the teacher 's presentation. The students( 71%) stated that videodisc was similar to television but more participatory ; the interactive capability not only encouraged them to pay attention but also helped them learn. When comparing the videodisc to books, 33% of these students mentioned similarities between the two media based on their ability to enjoy a self-paced reaming experience. Additionally, the students preferred working in pairs. <p> Mellin 's study( 1987) also viewed the teacher 's perception of this medium. Teachers indicated that the technology encouraged them to act as guides or facilitators ; however, many had difficulty actually assuming that role. <p> Although teachers and reamers report that there are some negative aspects associated with interactive videodisc instruction, the overwhelming attitude toward the medium is a positive one. Learners miss the personal attention of a teacher and are sometimes frustrated with the technological aspects of the medium ; but, they are enthusiastic about the ability to control reaming at their pace, receive immediate feedback and participate in active reamer involvement. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lessened when using the interactive videodisc mode. Effects on Learning Time <p> Research studies have utilized the time factor as an IVI evaluation criterion. Lawrence and Price( 1985) noted the time differential in their study of a traditional classroom approach to teaching the Language Experience Method of reading and the videodisc approach. The interactive videodisc group completed the lesson in 40 minutes while the traditional classroom lecture group required a 90-minute lesson. Additionally, the researchers cited the time advantage realized by using the videodisc as a means of reteaching as well as for initial instruction. Significantly less reaming time required for videodisc learner groups compared to traditional classroom instruction was reported by Bunderson( 1984). It was estimated that there was a 30 to 40 percent time savings with videodisc instruction in comparing the two groups on the variables of presentation time, outside study time, and total reaming time. The author concluded that the time savings involved in using the videodisc instructional strategy should be taken into consideration when evaluating the medium. <p> The Digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( Interactive Video Information System). A study was undertaken( May, 1984) to determine if the videodisc medium would take less time than a self-paced instruction course and if it would be more motivating than traditional courses. The control group of 48 engineers completed the courses using a self-paced instruction program. The treatment group of 51 engineers received instruction using the IVIS program. The data analysis indicated that the average time students needed to complete the IVIS courses was 23.1 % to 46.5% less. Using t-tests, these differences were significant at the.01 level for two of the courses and at the.05 level. successfully. The time factor involved in instruction is of particular importance to those in the business field but not dealt with as often by the educational community. Conclusion <p> The literature reveals that researchers in the military, business and education sectors have focused on three areas in evaluating the effectiveness of this technological medium : learner achievement, learner attitude, and instruction time. These three measures have provided a blueprint upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that interactive videodisc instruction can be used effectively as an instructional medium for many disciplines and in varied settings. In many cases, researchers indicate that it was more effective than the traditional lecture method. <p> Since learner attitude has been shown to be very positive, this is a further stimulus for the study and use of this technological medium. The reamer controls the teaming time and is able to be actively involved. This appeals to most reamers and was cited by many of the subjects of research studies as the medium 's most favorable feature. This positive reamer attitude toward interactive videodisc is true of all age levels and content areas investigated in this research review. This attitude is further heightened by the appeal of the television screen and computer capabilities of interactive videodisc technology. <p> All of the studies of interactive videodisc instruction involved with examining the time it takes to complete instruction as an effectiveness factor concluded that less time( to varying degrees) is involved in learning when compared to more traditional intructional strategies. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used as a teaching strategy. As with any teaching strategy, it should be used with the abilities of the reamer and the content of the program in mind. The self-pacing and interactivity features of the medium make it especially beneficial to reamers. <p>
