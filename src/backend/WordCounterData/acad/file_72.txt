4010941 This presentation describes in some detail the gifted programme that has been in place for five years at a large comprehensive high school near Montreal. As a " school within a school " the Tags( talented and gifted) programme serves approximately 7% of the student body of 1700 students. Special classes, facilities, and opportunities highlight the benefits of belonging to the programme. A core group of teachers dedicate considerable extra time to the pursuits that interest these curious and intellectually astute students. Introduction <p> The Talented and Gifted Programme TaG at Centennial Regional High School in Greenfield Park, Quebec, excels as a " school within a school. " The 5-year experience is set up to encourage specialization as students become increasingly familiar and comfortable with their talents and their interests. Highly academic in its concentration, the programme telescopes certain courses according to the capacity and curiosity of the student concerned. In this way academically talented individuals escape the boredom so often associated with bright students. Each participant is encouraged to progress at a level of individual capability. As a result, most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science, can be completed by the end of Secondary IV( Grade 10). Then, during their final year in high school( Secondary V), students are able to participate in Advanced Placement Courses at a local CEGEP( junior college) or to pursue individual enrichment opportunities according to their personal desires and expectations. A Pyramid <p> The entire programme is structured like a pyramid. Secondary I( Grade 7) forms the foundation wherein students are introduced to the Tags philosophy of study, as they begin their concentrated programmes in mathematics and science. In the former discipline they cover all of the Secondary I and much of the Secondary II curriculum. Scientific studies include Physical Science and Ecology, which is linked with Geography. In Secondary II( Grade 8), Introduction to Physical Science and Biology provides the scientific fare, while math explores the remainder of the Grade 8 and all of the Grade 9 curriculum as it is defined by the Ministry of Education in Quebec. <p> In the meantime all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual initiative and independent study. For those students who have earned self-enrichment time by showing their capability to do required class work and to meet evaluation requirements independently, classroom attendance becomes optional. Self-Enrichment <p> Those students who prefer to work on their own or in small groups are provided time, space, and supervision, whereby they can develop valuable study habits and explore areas of personal interest. <p> The space provided is a brightly lighted resource room equipped with Macintosh Plus computers and printers, as well as Apple IIe computers, with electric typewriters, spirit stencil machine, overhead projector, tape cassette decks, study areas, and resource books in a variety of fields. Students may also choose, at any time during the day, to work in the library, where access to an Apple IIe computer is also provided. opportunity for independent field trips is readily available to any individual or group wishing to carry on research outside the school building. <p> Supervision for such individualized study is provided by teachers who are assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction and guidance on project work. Expanded Opportunities <p> In each of the required subject areas, required course material is covered in considerably less time than is afforded to those courses within the regular stream of studies. The extra time that accumulates is readily utilized by expanded interest programmes within the school. Students can join the school band, pursue graphic arts enrichment, participate in the library 's " Reading is Fun " project, plan for participation in the school 's annual Science Fair or Geography Fair, develop skills in public speaking or debating, and write, produce, and direct school dramatic productions( two such full scale productions have been undertaken by the TaG students since the programme began four years ago). <p> All of these opportunities are available because of the time that the students garner as they work at the leading edge of their intellectual and talent capabilities. Cycle II - The Pyramid Comes to a Point <p> As the TaG students move into Secondary III( Grade 9), specialization begins to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chemistry I, as well as Functions in math. In Secondary IV they complete the high school regimen of Physics and Chemistry, as well as Maxi-functions and Vectors. Thus they have paved the way for Advanced Placement in Secondary V, their final year of high school. Some TaG students opt for a two year course in aviation that is being pioneered at the school because of many aviation-based industries situated in the Montreal area. <p> Increased specialization and clarification of desired goals takes place in Cycle II TaG( Grades 9, 10,11). Students are urged to study seriously their occupational aspirations, with a view to fashioning their academic curriculum accordingly. Those who have little or no idea of future plans are encouraged to consider a broad spectrum of possibilities in order to keep many options open. To that end, they are urged to participate in the Guidance Department 's " Choices " Programme, which gives direction and clarification to otherwise scattered values and unsettled inclinations. <p> Those Secondary V students who do not participate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variety of enrichment classes. Beyond those mentioned earlier, these include computer technology, business law, and taxation. Staff <p> The core of teachers primarily responsible for the success and supervision of the TaG programme come from many backgrounds. They form a team that meets regularly to discuss field trips, projects, and student performance. Three of the staff have received their Diploma in the Psychology and Education of the Gifted from McGill University 's Faculty of Education. All team members are available at different times throughout the day to assist students in the Resource Room or on individualized project work. other faculty members assist by giving their individual expertise in specialized fields beyond the regular curriculum. <p> Because the students pursue their interests outside the traditional classroom setting, greater demands are placed upon the teachers in terms of supervision and evaluation. While every student must obviously meet the requirements of each course as set down by the Quebec Ministry of Education, each focus on some specific interest which might develop deeper and broader familiarity in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool that the TaG teachers provide to the students and their parents comes as semi-annual reports in each subject area. These reports give individualized analyses of the student 's aptitude and progress. A copy of each report is kept in the students ' personal files in order to guide the pursuit of their most productive abilities and interests. These reports are considerably more helpful than the simple recorded grades, because students can analyze teachers ' perceptions and judge their applicability to individual performance. Mentors <p> The programme is in the process of gathering a core of interested people from the community to tutor gifted students in subjects or interests outside the regular curriculum. other professionals are being asked to allow interested students to shadow their activities in order to learn first hand the abilities and expectations associated with given professions. Multicultural Awareness Programme <p> After-school classes in modern languages broaden linguistic familiarity beyond the required French, English and Latin courses built into the programme. Italian, Spanish, Russian, Greek and Punjabi have drawn wide interest among students, who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Because Centennial Regional High School caters to a wide variety of ethnic groups who live on the South Shore of Montreal, the school heightens students ' awareness of the richness of its many cultural backgrounds through an annual cultural extravaganza. A particular ethnic group is highlighted each year, and a gala evening of dinner and entertainment focuses on the best that culture has to offer. <p> The TaG programme interfaces with this experience in a very involved way. Its students plan much of the decorative transformation of the cafeteria. They help with the preparation and service of the meal, and many are participants in the evening 's entertainment. " A Night in Rome, " " A Night on the Nile, " " A Night at the Taj Mahal, " and " The Night of the Dragon " have tested the creative genius of the fine arts, home economics, and drama departments to bring about a richly diverse experience not only for the members of each cultural group, but for all those interested in broadening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks of June, after the Cycle I students( Grades 7 and 8) have completed their required curriculum, they participate in a Remedial and Enrichment Programme. The TaG students use this time to take specialized courses in philosophy, logic, psychology, and drama. These opportunities for enrichment offer the gifted students intensive exposure to three fields which can be of considerable assistance as they progress through the entire programme. <p> This June experience is intended to augment the dramatic endeavors undertaken during the school year. The students have taken their productions into the local elementary schools to entertain their former schoolmates and teachers, and to demonstrate some of the fun elements of the Talented and Gifted Programme. Identification of TaG Students <p> There are probably as many criteria identifying the talented as there are gifted programmes, searching for a more reliable and perfect vehicle of selection. At Centennial, several factors are considered in the identification process. Students in their final year of elementary school( Grade 6) who are interested in the TaG programme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early February. This is the first step in the selection process. <p> Subsequently, parents are asked to complete an inventory of their child 's apparent interests and skills as evidenced around the home. The students themselves are asked to fill in a personal interest file, and, finally, the Grade 6 teachers are asked for a statement of student aptitude, talent expression and overall impressions. All this information is analyzed by a three-member admissions committee composed of the principal, academic vice-principal, and TaG department head. Approximately 30 students are then invited to become members the TaG programme, either as members of the enclosed class, or as participants in those specific academic areas where they show high aptitude. <p> During the year, all students in Secondary I and II take the Gates-McGinitie and the Canadian Test of Basic Skills. The TaG I students also take the WISC-R to complete their battery of standardized tests. From all of these results a well rounded picture of aptitude and performance is compiled. If any student in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the introductory year of high school, that individual is invited to consider entering into the TaG programme on either a part time basis( specific classes) or as a full time participant. Elitism <p> It seems that every specialized programme in education has to dodge the cruel darts of alleged elitism. If anyone wants to destroy a possible enrichment opportunity on any level, all that is necessary is to accuse it of elitism. our TaG programme does not cater to the pernicious platitudes of egalitarianism. We believe that the special talents of every student should be developed to the ultimate of which we are capable as concerned educators. Those talents are not doled out equally to every student. Therefore every student is not treated the same. We feel that the cultivation of a talented and gifted clientele is no more elitist than the encouragement and support of varsity athletic teams and their necessarily selective identification, nor the attention that is appropriately given to Special Education programmes. <p> We seek to provide the best opportunities for our student body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gifted Programme is only one of the many challenges to excellence that have helped to make our high school outstanding quality secondary education in the Montreal area. <p> By Cajetan J.
