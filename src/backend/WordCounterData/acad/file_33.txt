4004241 ABSTRACT. Rapid construction of new spaces like hotels, malls, private clubs, and gated communities in Greater Cairo, Egypt produces structures disconnected spatially and conceptually from most of the existing urban fabric. Their spatial concepts and practices, as well as architectural forms and expertise, are based largely on globally available models. Planning and construction are guided by the search for security in the face of real or imagined fear of the urban masses and political upheaval. Concrete walls, guarded entrances, and high-tech security technology bear witness to these fears. Analysis of the Mena House Hotel, the Grand Egyptian Museum project, and the First Mall in Giza shows how these projects globalize Cairo and localize the global. Often these globalized spaces are remade by creating local and regional ties and design features that were not anticipated by the planners. Such changes shed light on underlying dynamics and contribute to a better understanding of in situ globalization. Whereas their physical features tend to accentuate their globalized nature, these spaces do not exist in isolation from their geographical and cultural contexts. Their everyday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholarly debates. <p> Keywords : Cairo ; Egypt ; exterritorial spaces ; Giza ; globalization ; reterritorialization <p> The Web site of the Mena House Hotel in Giza, Egypt boasts an impressive list of awards the hotel has received. In 2002 and 2003 the Mena House, located at the foot of the Cheops Pyramid, was listed among " The Most Exclusive Hotels in the World, " " Top Ten Hotels -- World 's Best Service " and " The Best 500 Hotels in the World "( Oberoi Hotels 2005). Of the twelve awards listed, only two -- " Best Landscaped Garden in Egypt " and " Highest Guest Service Standard Amongst All Hotels in Egypt " -- situate and compare the hotel in its immediate geographical context ; that is, Egypt. The other awards use larger, regional -- Africa, Indian Ocean, and Middle East -- or global references in evaluating standards and achievements of this prestigious hotel. Similarly, announcements and debates of the new Grand Egyptian Museum mention that this megaproject, which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pyramids, is " not only the largest museum of Egyptian artifacts in the world, but also one of the largest museums in the world "( Ionides 2004). Like the Mena House, the museum project uses global comparisons and points of reference to illustrate its grandeur and envisioned role in the world. Reflecting similar quests for global competition and recognition, new shopping malls and other places of leisure and consumption in Cairo compete with their peers regionally and globally for setting new records, not only in terms of size but also with regard to outlandish features, such as ice-skating rinks or even skiing facilities in the midst of desert conditions. The Mena House, the Grand Egyptian Museum, and various malls are located on Egyptian soil, but where are they on the powerful symbolic map of globalization? Where are their cultural and economic points of reference? Do they globalize Egypt, or do they localize the global? How far do local, national, or regional forces interact and possibly contest these icons of globalization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cairo, like many postcolonial metropolises, has witnessed the rapid construction of new spaces that seem to be separate and disconnected, not only spatially but also conceptually, from most of the existing urban fabric. Examples include hotels, shopping malls, private clubs, and upscale, gated communities on the city 's desert outskirts. This highly fragmented new spatiality also includes a small number of older spaces, which have successfully kept pace or smoothly inserted themselves into the race of global competition, profit, and recognition. One such example is the Mena House Hotel. As different as their histories and functional uses are, examples at the forefront of the new spatiality are closely linked in their underlying models, in their firm integration into networks of global capitalism, and, in particular, into the rapidly growing global service industry of leisure, consumption, and tourism. These projects ' spatial concepts, architectural forms and expertise, and definitions of spatial practices are based largely on globally available models. Frequently the planning and construction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances planning and construction processes are guided by the search for security in the face of real or imagined fears of the urban masses and political upheaval. Concrete walls, guarded entrances, and high-tech security technology bear witness to these fears. A characteristic feature of these new, globalized spaces is that most are physical enclaves, often quasi-fortresses, which are largely inaccessible to most urban residents except as workers. The paramount nature of security concerns and the exclusion of the urban masses hints at the contested nature of these new icons of globalization. <p> This article examines the cases of the Mena House Hotel, the Grand Egyptian Museum project, and the First Mall in Giza as examples of in situ globalization. It addresses the underlying dynamics of the making and remaking of these globalized spaces, particularly those that counter their exterritorial nature and reterritorialize elements of their existence by creating local and regional ties and features that were not anticipated by the planners. <p> Conceived and negotiated in the context of a largely Western-dominated, rapidly globalizing, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general by a complex articulation of global fashions, lifestyles, politics of knowledge, and architectural possibilities. They possess distinctly exterritorial characteristics, in that they represent spatialities that differ from their physical environment. In their everyday dynamics, these spaces appear to respond and cater to the needs and demands of a globalized clientele of both local and global origin. Globalized spaces tend to be exterritorial, in that their construction, maintenance, and economies are largely controlled by global forces. Locally, these projects underline the ever-sharper distinction between the haves and the have-nots and occasionally give cause to horrific visions of future cityscapes of " creeping slums and rampant poverty, coexisting cheek by jowl with international hotels and large spaces dedicated to consumption and leisure time for those who can afford it "( Abaza 2004). <p> The increasing polarization of city dwellers underlies the often-dormant tensions that accompany the recent transformations of many postcolonial cityscapes. The existence of new fortresses of leisure and consumption next door to poverty and in the midst of different cultural and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among local poorer populations. Whether these are expressed out loud or maintained in closed quarters, they exist and need to be taken into account, for they can be translated into action at any given moment, particularly in times of heightened public or political tension. Thus, although globalized urban projects are products and properties of global dynamics and actors, they also harbor and produce distinctly local features in a constant struggle with the global forces. Whereas their physical features tend to accentuate their globalized nature, these spaces do not exist in isolation from their geographical and cultural environments, and their everyday realities tell tales of reterritorialization that are frequently overlooked in scholarly debates. These projects are duplicates of globally available models, but the moment their doors open they set in motion a complicated process of localization or reterritorialization that takes place on two levels. On one hand, this involves users and patrons of the local elite, as well as wealthy expatriate communities and tourists who appropriate and remake planned spatialities for their own purposes. On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in specific manners by those who work there and maintain them and by the few who manage to " sneak in " despite being excluded or unwanted. These processes are far from democratic and do not include large segments of the population. They are significant in a larger context of national, regional, and global transformations. GLOBALIZATION AND URBAN SEGREGATION <p> Recent observers have been alarmed by the dramatically uneven impact of globalization. Zygmunt Bauman voiced concerns about the growing disparity between the world 's rich and poor. He observed that " the so-called ' globalizing ' processes rebound in the redistribution of privileges and deprivations, of wealth and poverty, of resources and impotence, of power and powerlessness, of freedom and constraint "( 1998,70). This initiates a " world-wide restratification, in the course of which a new socio-cultural hierarchy, a world-wide scale, is put together "( p. 70 ; italics in the original). He underlines that individuals and territories do not enter this process as equals or with equal chances. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the context of these globalizing processes is ironic, even an outright slap in the face of the majority of humanity. Bauman further explained : <p> What is a free choice for some descends as cruel fate upon others. And since those ' others ' tend to grow unstoppably in numbers and sink ever deeper into despair born of a prospectless existence, one will be well advised to speak of ' glocalization '( Roland Robertson 's apt term, exposing the unbreakable unity between ' globalizing ' and ' localizing ' pressures -- a phenomenon glossed over in the one-sided concept of globalization), and to define it mostly as the process of the concentration of capital, finance and all other resources of choice and effective action, but also -- perhaps above all -- of the concentration of freedom to move and to act( two freedoms which for all practical purposes have become synonymous).( p. 70 ; italics in the original ; see also Robertson 1992) <p> Bauman leaves no doubt that globalization is uneven and produces distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excluded populations who are locked into tightly packed spaces of poverty and hopelessness. " Flexibility, " " mobility, " " freedom of movement, " " choices, ' " global networks and connections, " " free flow of goods, knowledge and information, " " leisure and consumption, " and similar terms frequently used to describe the blessings of globalization are the exact opposite of the poverty and exclusion experienced daily by the disadvantaged. <p> Bauman employs the concept of " exterritoriality " to identify sites that accommodate the global flow of wealth and consumption, which are central to the new regime. He notes that the " centres of meaning-and-value production are today exterritorial and emancipated from local constraints "( 1998, 3), which contrasts with much of the local and situated human conditions -- here first and foremost poverty. Globalization implies a segregation of activities and population, but it is misleading to posit the results of globalization in strictly oppositional terms. The processes of globalizing and localizing are part and parcel of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together and against each other in the same setting at different times. Although the sum total of globalizing processes is the production and defense of the wealth, freedom, and mobility of those who already have it, as well as the recruitment of some new members to these privileged circles, in their everyday workings these processes are often less clear and marked by irrationalities, some failures, and local interference and appropriations. <p> In spatial terms, these transformations have fostered the emergence of cityscapes marked by segregation and exclusion. Globalization and its local( dis) contents, or spatial violence, have become a pressing concern as segments of urban populations have been locked into specific spaces and barred from others. Living and moving through city spaces turns into a difficult and often painful task for ordinary citizens. Farha Ghannam( 2002) examines the lives of lower-class residents of Cairo who were pushed to the relative margins of the city in an attempt to globalize -- that is make available high value for investment capital -- downtown and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from globalizing spaces, Ghannam notes, they are nonetheless closely tied into the processes of globalization by way of their experiences as migrants and by their sheer presence as workers and consumers in the globalizing metropolis. James Farrer( 2002) observes how globalization in Shanghai has rapidly pulled whole sections of the city, and segments of the younger generation in particular, into its orbit. The physical landscape of Shanghai, probably more than any other city in the world, has changed in an impressive and unparalleled manner since about 1990, serving as a fast-paced model for the slower changes of other globalizing metropolises. <p> As global cities experience the proliferation of segregated and guarded, privatized public spaces such as malls, clubs, and gated communities, concern about spatial segregation is growing( Davis 1992 ; Ellin 1997). Teresa Caldeira( 1996,2001), Setha Low( 1997,200l, 2003), and other scholars( Glasze and Alkhayyal 2002 ; Juergens and Gnad 2002 ; Leisch 2002 ; Webster, Glasze, and Frantz 2002 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban spaces reflects and reinforces the polarization of urban residents. Caldeira is concerned about whether the loss of public spaces and encounters ultimately foreshadows the end of democratic society and thus poses a serious threat to societies. Many observers would agree with Mike Davis( 1992) that a distinct line exists between the in-crowd and out-crowd, with the in-crowd inhabiting comfortable and luxurious gated communities, spending their leisure time in equally fortified malls and hotels, while the out-crowd is left to populate increasingly underserviced and overpopulated urban quarters. <p> Waleed Hazbun uses the concepts of " deterritorialization " and " reterritorialization " to emphasize the processual nature of changes. Deterritorialization " refers to the condition of economic activity becoming less dependent on resources and markets which are place specific "( Hazbun 2002, 54). This process is not limited to the economic sphere but also includes cultural, political, and social aspects. Analytically more significant and intriguing is the concept of reterritorialization, which Hazbun employs for " forms of territorialized production where decreases in some spatially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased dependence on transaction with spatially dependent transaction costs which allow for the exploitation of locationally defined positive external economies and rents "( p. 61 ; italics in the original). Hazbun 's more economically oriented concept can be expanded to address broader processes and transformations that trigger political, cultural, spatial, and social transformation. In this article I use " reterritorialization " for a larger array of dynamics that situate and localize, negotiate, and even challenge globalized and exterritorial spaces and processes. Moments and spaces of reterritorialization are analytically relevant because they often constitute inroads into the more generic or planned universe of globalization and, as such, exemplify the potential of local actors to challenge and remake globalized and exterritorial spaces. These moments and spaces can illustrate the localization of the global and point to potential entries for critical voices and practices. GLOBALIZATION IN EGYPT <p> The processes of globalization since the late 1970s have had different repercussions in different locations. Aspects of Egypt 's recent globalization are marked by the country 's long history as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's recent economic transformations. Modern mass tourism was launched in Egypt when Thomas Cook organized his first packaged tours in the 1860s to travel up the Nile River and visit pharaonic monuments. Early Egyptian tourism was founded on the uniqueness of Egypt 's pharaonic past, Egypt 's relative geographical proximity to Europe, and its favorable climate. Competition with other tourist destinations was next to irrelevant until well into the twentieth century. Egypt was a constant on the global map of tourism, attracting well-to-do tourists throughout British colonial rule( 1882-1952). In the 1950s and 1960s the Egyptian state-controlled, but partly privately managed, tourism sector expanded in small increments, as reflected in the construction of the Nile Hilton in 1958 and the launching of the Sound and Light Show at the pyramids in 1961( Nelson 1997 ; Gray 1998). By the 1970s the relatively low-key, more exclusive tourist industry began to change dramatically. <p> Hazbun observes that, for the Middle East at large, dropping oil prices and the crisis of early postcolonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costly welfare benefits for large segments of society by way of public-sector jobs, public education, and health care -- and also, to a certain extent, through public-sector contracts -- had triggered the necessity for change in the 1970s and 1980s( 2002, 19). In Egypt the need for change was pressing, considering its limited oil resources, scarcity of arable land, high level of military expenditure because of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and relatively large and growing population. Promises of high-quality public education and health care became more difficult to deliver. Liberalization of the economy and the concomitant shift of the state 's constituency became paramount tools and agents of change, reflecting models negotiated simultaneously by other postcolonial states. Under the leadership of President Anwar Sadat, the 1970s marked Egypt 's accelerated entry into the global capitalist economy and the fierce global competition for resources, markets, and customers. In the absence of oil or large manufacturing industries, tourism based on the more intense and targeted marketing of the pharaonic heritage was identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New tourist projects differed from earlier ones in size, aspects of control and ownership, characteristics of investors, and dynamics, and awareness of global competition. <p> Economic decisions and changes in Egypt paralleled or succeeded economic changes in Western or industrialized countries. Post-World War II economic prosperity and the general expansion of airline traffic slowly enabled ever-larger segments of Western populations to travel longer distances and afford more expensive accommodations and forms of leisure( Hazbun 2002). By the late 1970s the dynamics of the emerging global tourism industry and the characteristics of tourists bound for Egypt were in flux. Whereas earlier travelers to Egypt had been members of the Western European and U.S. elite, Egypt now started to appeal to the European and Japanese -- and, to a lesser extent, the American -- middle class, and, by the 1990s, to the lower-middle class as well. The fast-paced expansion of the clientele for international travel was paramount to underwriting Egypt 's ambitious plans for global integration and prosperity( Gray 1998). In 1998 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiatives : " After having passed through a successful period of economic reform, incentives, guarantees and legal administration, investors from Egypt and abroad have been encouraged to take part in the tourism development process. As a result, lodging capacity was raised from 18,000 in 1982 to 75,000 in 1997. And we now have 603 projects under construction.. Egypt has invested more than $50 billion. to improve the infrastructure and public utilities "( al-Ahram Weekly, 21-26 May 1998). <p> From the early 1980s onward, considerable public and private resources were invested in the rapid improvement of the tourist sector under President Hosni Mubarak. Until the mid-1980s, pharaonic Egypt remained the single most important marketing tool for Egypt 's mass-tourism industry. The pyramids were " the " symbol for Egypt that guaranteed instant product recognition( Beirman 2003). Growing numbers of European and Japanese tourists flocked to Egypt. The arrival of thousands of tour groups necessitated further additions to the local tourist infrastructure. New hotels were constructed, not only along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the vicinity of Cairo 's airport and in other parts of the city( Cole and Altorki 1998). <p> The expansion of Egypt 's tourism industry was neither smooth nor consistently profitable. It encountered periods of crisis and setbacks. During the first Gulf War, in 1991, tourism in the Middle East plunged dramatically. Closer to home, the slowly escalating confrontation between Islamic militants and the Egyptian government became a pressing concern that spilled over into the public sphere beginning in about 1992. In order to hurt government politics and gain an international platform, militants started to target tourists and tourist sites. Militants and the government began a bloody game of attack and counterattack. During the 1992-1995 period alone Egypt lost an estimated v.s. $1 billion in tourist revenues because of this ongoing conflict( Gray 1998). In the mid-1990s officials repeatedly claimed that they had successfully eliminated all militants, only to be proven wrong when yet another militant attack took place. In order to remain globally attractive and competitive, Egypt had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The government chose to work on both options. <p> Starting in the 1980s, beach and diving tourism were added to Egypt 's catalog of attractions. Superb beaches and beautiful coral reefs, along with Egyptian efforts to integrate the Sinai Peninsula more closely into the state and economy, facilitated the rapid expansion of sites like Sharm el-Sheikh and Naama Beach -- on the southern tip of the peninsula -- and Nuweiba and Dahab -- on the Gulf of Aqaba. Similar dynamics unfolded around places like Hurghada, on the western coast of the Red Sea, where hotels and numerous holiday villages were soon constructed( Cole and Altorki 1998). Overspeculation, overconstruction, and low-quality construction around Hurghada pushed some sites into the lower-priced range of European beach-tourism packages. <p> While the tourist industry was being massively upgraded and made attractive for the fiercely competitive global market, similar transformations took shape in other economic sectors, as the Egyptian government started to sell off considerable parts of the state-run industrial sector, was able to attract new companies, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among them Mercedes Benz and Opel, a German subsidiary of General Motors, set up assembly plants in Egypt. Regional considerations played a major role for Mercedes, because automobiles manufactured in Egypt can easily be shipped to the countries on the Arabian Peninsula, where the company has many loyal customers. Along with production of commodities and, increasingly, luxury commodities came construction of the appropriate outlets, particularly malls. Cairo has witnessed a veritable mushrooming of malls since the early 1990s( Raafat 1998 ; Stryjak 2000, 2001 ; Abaza 2001). Malls not only are commercial outlets but also fulfill the parallel mission of accommodating leisure and related consumption by including features such as restaurants, movie theaters, video-game arcades, and even ice-skating rinks. In the process, a particular type of consumer culture is introduced and locally negotiated. The emergence of gated communities in Cairo in the mid-1990s has allowed yet another form of retreat from urban and public life( Kuppinger 2004). <p> Economic policies and changes in Egypt since the 1990s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global race for investment and profit. In this climate of competition Egypt has been trying to attract companies to produce, tourists to come and spend, and nationals to consume. In many aspects its efforts have been successful, for numerous companies have settled in the country and produce many consumer goods for local, regional( Mercedes Benz, for example), and global markets( for instance, textiles). Tourists flock to pharaonic sites and Red Sea beaches, a flow occasionally disrupted by regional political crises. Malls, new hotels, private clubs, and other sites of leisure and consumption have opened their doors to Egyptians and to regional Arab and global tourists, who consume and spend. CAIRO 'S GLOBALIZING CITYSCAPE <p> Since the early nineteenth century, Cairo 's spatiality and infrastructure have undergone dramatic changes( see, for example, J. L. Abu-Lughod 1971 ; Scharabi 1989 ; Raymond 1993, Raafat 1995a, 1995b, 1997, 1998), reflected particularly in its urban quarters and their residents ' everyday lives( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in changes in popular culture and everyday practices( Armbrust 1996 ; Abaza 200l ; L. Abu-Lughod 2005). <p> All three of my case studies are in Giza, a city that, though independent, forms an integral part of Greater Cairo. The following summary of the urban transformations that shaped Cairo at large and Giza in particular focus on two contexts to illustrate some of the political and cultural circumstances that interacted with the economic processes outlined above. I look at the urbanization and construction of a modern Egyptian cityscape in Giza in the early decades of the twentieth century and provide an overview of the emerging cityscape of leisure and consumption at the beginning of the twenty-first-century in Greater Cairo. <p> By the beginning of the twentieth century Cairo was a dense and diverse cityscape. It included the Fatimid city, Old( Coptic) Cairo, old neighborhoods such as Ezbekiya or Husainiyah, the port town of Bulaq( now absorbed by the city), emerging European developments such as Maadi or Heliopolis, a modern downtown centered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and growing modern Egyptian neighborhoods such as Sakakini and Bab El-Luq. The complexity of the city and its neighborhoods can not be described in simplistic terms of " modern " or " traditional " ; the cityscape was made and remade by its authorities and residents in long and complex processes of expansion and modernization. Nineteenth-century rulers of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty, precolonial local and foreign architects and builders, and late-nineteenth-century British colonial policies, as well as Egyptian, regional, and European capital all worked to build a city that none could claim as their product and none could ever completely control. At the beginning of the twentieth century this multilayered city was home to an equally complex, diverse, and growing -- colonial and colonized -- population guided by radically transformed politics, dreams, and visions. <p> Because the city was limited in the east by the Moqattam Mountains and had already considerably extended northeastward into the surrounding desert( Heliopolis), the look to the west, across the Nile, seemed promising( Kuppinger 2000) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, agricultural landscape interspersed with villages and the town of Giza extended all the way to the pyramids, which were connected to Cairo by the Pyramid Road. A basic tourist infrastructure was already in place, and more amenities were added in the early years of the twentieth century. A few elite Cairene families owned agricultural land in this area or had recently purchased garden lots for villas or summer residences. In effect, they pioneered the " suburbanization " of Giza. The first two decades of the twentieth century witnessed dramatic transformations as Giza became a central site of urban expansion. By the 1920s it boasted modern institutions such as the new national university, the zoo, the juvenile penitentiary, and emerging modern, middle-class neighborhoods, such as Agouza( next to the old Agouza villages) and Doqqi( surrounding the old village of Doqqi). The Ministry of Agriculture and the Museum of Agriculture followed in the 1930s and, eventually, so did the Royal Shooting Club. The Muslim, Christian, and Jewish Egyptian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Giza was " hot " in that it provided ample space for urban expansion -- at the expense of destroying valuable agricultural land -- unhampered by an existing cityscape. Some older Giza villages were destroyed for new developments ; many others were simply engulfed by the modern city and slowly turned into lower-class urban quarters. Although Giza on the whole remained an independent city and the capital of the Giza Governorate, its spatial transformations were directed by larger processes in Cairo, for most of its new residents were " migrants " from across the Nile. <p> The pyramid tourist infrastructure accommodated residential growth, and soon the Pyramid Road became an exclusive stretch of villas and mansions. British and other European nationals joined in the Giza mania, but Giza, more than any other elite neighborhood, remained an urban extension dominated by the modern Egyptian elite. Egyptian professionals, businessmen, politicians, and rural notables moved to central Giza( between the town of Giza in the south and the village of Agouza in the north, extending westward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects Giza was the first modern Egyptian city, for it was home to many nationalist intellectuals and professionals and reflected their visions of and plans for a modern and independent Egypt more than did any other residential area. <p> Guided by neoliberal economic policies, Giza, along with Greater Cairo, had entered another period of rapid transformation by the end of the twentieth century. Absorbed into the machinery of globalization, the city underwent visible changes of different kinds. Starting in the late 1980s, and soon gaining tremendous momentum, international food and fashion franchises -- Benetton, Pizza Hut, McDonald 's, Mexx, Baskin-Robbins, and others -- ever-fancier and larger malls, and new five-star hotels started to dot Cairo 's cityscape. Cairo 's notoriously jammed streets became even more crowded with new imports and ever-larger numbers of locally assembled foreign automobiles. By the mid-1990s Greater Cairo 's urban fringes became the object of dramatic speculation and construction activities. Gated communities and sports and other clubs mushroomed at unprecedented rates. This proliferation of new places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one such establishment to another, where those with enough financial resources could engage in a growing variety of( globalized/exterritorial) leisure activities without interacting much with the rest of the city. Not only the physical cityscape but also the cultural and social landscapes changed. Whether it was the new Mercedes for the elite, the Opel for the middle classes, the washing machine for the lower-middle classes, or the use of Ariel laundry detergent instead of the local Rabso brand for the lower classes, almost all urban residents have been drawn into the ever-faster circuits of globalized consumption. Lower-class youths can be spotted in their finest, four teenagers over two Cokes at McDonald 's. Growing numbers of young people across classes carry cell phones. <p> At the beginning of the twenty-first century, it is possible in Cairo, as in any other global city, to watch MTV in one 's air-conditioned apartment, eat out at MacDonald 's, watch a Hollywood film, shop for Western designer clothes, drive a European automobile, send e-mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawn on the urban outskirts, and engage in many other such icons of consumerist globalization. Whether this translates into a generic globalized lifestyle is highly questionable, however, because Cairo residents -- and others across the globe -- are more than globalization 's cultural and social clones. Individuals and groups enthusiastically frequent new places and splurge on leisurely activities and other consumption, true, but they do so using their own cultural and social rationales and habits. In the process, they claim ownership of these places and remake them in unpredictable ways. Similarly, the tensions of exclusion remain, because many Cairenes are denied access to the new spaces. It is within this context of rapid transformation, seemingly limitless opportunities, and harsh exclusion that I situate my analysis of the three exemplary cases to illustrate how globalized spaces work and are reterritorialized in their everyday contexts and uses. THE MENA HOUSE HOTEL <p> The Mena House Hotel is one of the older examples among contemporary exterritorial spaces in Cairo/Giza( Kuppinger 2000, forthcoming a, forthcoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a hunting lodge, the original building, which still forms the core of the hotel -- rebuilt and renovated numerous times -- was later enlarged to accommodate visitors for the festivities surrounding the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. In the 1870s the lodge became a private mansion before being turned into a hotel( Nelson 1997). At the beginning of the twentieth century the Mena House( named after a pharaoh of the early dynasties) was bought by the Egyptian Hotels Company, run by George Nungovich, the self-made magnate of the Egyptian hotel industry( Nelson 1997 ; Kuppinger 2000). As owner of the Savoy, the Continental, and the Helwan Hotels, he added the Mena House to a group of Cairo 's best hotels. In the early twentieth century the Mena House was frequently described as an elegant hotel with exclusive entertainment and superior amenities. Its events and patrons were subjects of debate on the social pages of the colonial Egyptian Gazette. Members of the local colonial elite and wealthy tourists mingled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chronicled. Quickly, the Mena House became a bastion for foreigners, foreign entertainment, and foreign profits -- and its reputation started to transcend Egypt 's boundaries. Despite the foreign or culturally detached nature of most of its clientele, entertainment, and economy, the hotel had one feature that was place bound : its location close to the Cheops Pyramid. Activities, entertainments, and, ultimately, part of its exclusive nature -- rooted partially in the possibility of charging for the fantastic view -- were tied to this unique location. As one early observer noted : " It would be difficult to find a more delightful place to be idle in than the Mena. Those majestic masses that tower like mountains nearby seem to induce disinclination to movement. Then, too, sitting down on the desert, with the pyramids for companions, it were impossible that any creature of average sensitiveness should not be conscious of the atmosphere of bygone ages which perennially abides about them "( Egyptian Gazette, 15 January 1902). This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court its customers, in order to assure that they came back and never tired of the magnificent place. Modern amenities such as a swimming pool and a golf course were added around the beginning of the twentieth century( Egyptian Gazette, 18 April 1904 ; Nelson 1997). By 1900 a pyramid tramline connected the pyramids to Cairo by way of the Kasr El-Nil Bridge( Egyptian Gazette, 2 August 1900). This allowed for easier travel to the pyramids and made the Mena House a feasible destination for afternoon visitors. The hotel 's location also made it a perfect stage for various spectacles, such as the two daredevil " airmen " who circled the pyramids in airplanes in January 1914( Egyptian Gazette, 13 January 1914). <p> During World War II the Mena House accommodated another important global spectacle : diplomacy. In November 1943 Winston Churchill, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and Chiang Kai-Shek met " under the shadow of the Pyramids "( New York Times, 1 December 1943, 29) to discuss Allied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice, the hotel had been cleared of its guests so it could serve as the headquarters of the British and American staff( Nelson 1997). " The three great present enemies of Japan " convened at the Mena House for a debate on " the strategy of war and peace in the Pacific "( Nelson 1997, 66) and to " settle the German fate "( New York Times, 6 December 1943, 7). The three leaders stayed in private villas in the vicinity of the pyramids ; the meetings were held in the hotel. The Mena House had turned into a first-rate global location that provided all the necessary features of transportation, communication, and -- increasingly important -- security to accommodate world leaders in most difficult times. <p> In the early 1970s the Mena House was taken over by the emerging India hotel giant Oberoi, which runs luxury hotels, largely in countries bordering the Indian Ocean( Clark 1997). The Oberoi company was founded and run by Mohan Singh Oberoi, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started his career " as a penniless hotel clerk in Simla, India, who had mortgaged his wife 's jewelry to buy the first hotel "( Hotelier 2002b). One of Oberoi 's specialties was " spotting and refurbishing run-down and undervalued properties, " which he would then renovate with painstaking attention to details, even " to the amount of down in every pillow and the exact length of the stem of every restaurant flower "( Hotelier 2002b). In the early 1970s the Mena House -- located in a country in relative crisis and economic stagnation after the 1967 war and the death of Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1970 -- in retrospect was a profitable deal with regard to the political and economic changes initiated in the 1970s. Under Oberoi management the Mena House received a thorough make over( Clark 1997) and was added to this growing chain of luxury hotels which was set on catapulting their establishments to the top of the hotel world. By 2002 the chain owned a total of thirty-seven " luxury and first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @). The change in ownership placed the Mena House on a new map of regionalist globalization in the Indian Ocean. A practical result of the Indian takeover is the fine Indian restaurant now featured at the Mena House. <p> Remodeled and also reconfirmed in its earlier role as a high-class cosmopolitan or globalized establishment, the trajectory of the Mena House continued. In December 1977 the hotel accommodated meetings at which the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel was drafted( New York Times, 15 December 1977). It is not surprising that the Mena House -- " a carefully groomed historic hotel "( New York Times, 15 December 1977, 1) -- was chosen once more for high-strung and potentially difficult international meetings, for it had long since proved its capabilities to provide amenities, technology, and security for such occasions. Although the view of the pyramids was a nice perquisite, the hotel 's location -- then still somewhat distant and apart from the city -- was an additional advantage for a politically sensitive conference. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert, security is less of a challenge at the Mena House than in downtown locations. Symbolically and geographically the hotel is as much in Cairo as it is outside and beyond it. Thus it was a perfect choice for a dramatically controversial event. Years later, in 1990, a full-fledged business and conference center was added to the hotel to underline its claim as a location for political and other conventions( Clark 1997). <p> In its contemporary everyday existence the Mena House is a hub for people and activities. German, Japanese, a few American, and other tourist groups rub shoulders in the winter season. Upper-class Egyptian families celebrate their children 's weddings or spend leisurely weekends at the hotel 's superb facilities. Families and individuals from the Persian Gulf come for their summer vacation. Expatriate workers and foreign-exchange students crowd the Indian restaurant year-round. The hotel 's lobby provides air conditioning and a space to sit for thrifty backpackers who stay in much less expensive downtown hotels. For waiters and other workers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who pass through its spaces for very different purposes. No one group can claim symbolic ownership of the place, yet all somehow contribute to it. The hotel remains an exclusive space, in that its guards and doormen will politely refuse access to those whom they deem inappropriate ; that is, the mass of lower-class Cairenes. <p> It is insightful to probe further into the Mena House 's curiously exterritorial, yet deeply local, characteristics. One of the more striking globalized spectacles in recent years that bespeak such seeming contradictions in the hotel 's vicinity was the millennium celebration, in which cutting-edge technologies and ancient glory were combined for utmost effect and profit : " Lasers, floodlight and fireworks lit up the ancient pyramids at Giza at midnight as Egypt greeted the new millennium with a lavish electronic concert that officials said drew more than 120,000 people. French composer Jean-Michel Jarre laid on an extravaganza of song, dance and music featuring 1,000 performers, entitled ' The Twelve Dreams of the Sun ' "( Reuters 2000). @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show was part of his government 's attempts to reestablish Egypt 's image as a safe tourist destination even as the country was still recovering from the 1997 Luxor massacre, when fifty-eight tourists were killed. As huge crowds stood at the foot of the pyramids, " some 8,500 wealthier people were wined and dined in luxury tents at $400 a head "( Reuters 2000). Rajiv Kaul, vice president of the Oberoi Hotels of Egypt and general manager of the Mena House, proudly noted that " Egypt has become one of the top three destinations for the millennium "( Reuters 1999). Kaul also predicted that Egypt was once more on its way to becoming an upscale tourist destination. For the millennium extravaganza the Mena House hosted the upscale clientele, for it raised its prices to between U.S$350 and U.S.$3,000 per night( from the regular U.S.$150-U.S. $1,450) for the glitzy spectacle( Famous Hotels 2002). <p> The Mena House Hotel contributes two features to the globalized landscape of Egypt. As a branch of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operates luxury hotels in India, Indonesia, Australia, Mauritius, and Egypt( Oberoi Hotels 2005), it represents the exceptional case in the global scenery of luxury hotels, which is dominated by American( Hilton, Marriott, Sheraton, Hyatt) and European( Intercontinental, Mvenpick, Meridien) companies. This circumstance situates the hotel in an Indian Ocean economy that is frequently overlooked. The hotel also represents Egypt 's presence in the competition for the finest and most luxurious establishments on the globe. THE GRAND EGYPTIAN MUSEUM <p> By the beginning of the twentieth century, under British colonial rule, the Egyptian Museum had been constructed in a central Cairo location on Ismailiya Square( today 's Midan Tahrir). Taking almost five years to build, the museum, whose main aesthetic idea had been " to maintain classic proportions, but in no way to make the building a copy of any ancient monument, " cost E 189,220( Egyptian Gazette, 15 January 1902). The museum was formally opened on 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests of Egyptian and colonial dignitaries( Egyptian Gazette, 17 December 1902). Providing a home for thousands of pharaonic artifacts, it soon became a must-see for foreign tourists and, later, for Egyptian schoolchildren. <p> For almost a century the museum was the destination of thousands of eager visitors of various origins. In the last decades of the twentieth century, however, a number of problems arose. First, complaints were voiced that the museum is totally overloaded with antiquities, many of which are stored in basement spaces which are not conducive to the preservation of age-old treasures. Second, the museum is located on the busy Midan Tahrir, the " hub of Cairo "( Farag 1999), where traffic jams are frequent. Uninitiated tourists have difficulty crossing streets in the vicinity of the museum : Fatemah Farag quoted a desperate foreigner who describes this undertaking as a " real nightmare "( 1999). Despite the fact that the square has continually been the object of development plans for " putting up footbridges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- a labyrinth of underground garages in the first years of the new millennium, " it remains a serious logistical challenge( 1999). <p> Existing logistical challenges were soon augmented by new ones, as Egyptian militant Islamic activists started to engage the state in a political battle in the 1990s and quickly learned that targeting tourist sites guaranteed instant international attention and coverage. Such attacks severely hurt the economy and the vast investments that had been made in the tourist industry. By illustrating the government 's dependence on Western economies, the militants hoped that their fellow citizens would understand how much their government had become a pawn in the hands of the West. In this context of political controversy, the parking lot outside the Egyptian Museum twice became the target of attacks, once in March 1993 and again in September 1997. In the first attack only vehicles were damaged when a bomb exploded among parked buses. In 1997 gunmen killed eleven German tourists in the parking lot( Moussa 2001). <p> Lack of space, substandard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political conflict triggered debates and considerations for the museum 's future. The museum was in need of a larger, technologically superior( in terms of the preservation of artifacts), more accessible, safer, and more easily controllable location. These necessities combined with other ideas -- such as that the museum should be not just a warehouse of treasures but a center for knowledge and scholarly exchange -- to form the background of the Grand Egyptian Museum project that germinated in the 1990s. <p> The ideal geographical, symbolic, and economic site for this gigantic project was soon found at the pyramid plateau in Giza. Planned to cover approximately 117 acres( al-Ahram Weekly, 7-13 February 2002) and to cost U.S.$350 million, this megaproject " will not only be the largest museum of Egyptian artifacts in the world, but also one of the largest museums in the world "( Ionides 2004). Minister of Culture Farouq Hosni even claimed that the museum will be " the biggest museum in the world "( ESIS 2003) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2002( Arabic News 2002). The international contest for the museum design yielded 1,557 entries from 83 countries. A jury consisting of Italian, French, British, Korean, Romanian, and three Egyptian experts presented the first prize to the Irish firm of Heneghan Peng Architects( IUA 2003). Despite their 126 entries, Egyptian participants did not even receive an honorary mention( Asfour 2003). <p> From its inception the Grand Egyptian Museum project has vied for global reach and connections. Physical features, scholarly facilities, and general services reflect the search for global recognition and integration : " With extensive conference, library and multimedia provisions, the building is intended to be more than a mere container of artifacts devoted to Egyptology, becoming instead an international centre of culture, and a spectacular landscape feature "( Gregory 2003). The museum will " serve as a fully computerized information centre for Egyptologists " and, for the convenience of tourists and scholars, the structure will house " extensive restaurant and shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " publication centre for books, CDs, videotapes,. etc. "( El Zahlawi 2000). Exclusively for scholars, it will provide " proper laboratories for scientific research, conservation, restoration and photography according to the latest technology "( El-Aref 2002). Hoping to attract thousands of visitors a day, the project reaches out globally and will hopefully " contribute to the development of tourism in Egypt and meet the varied tastes and needs of visitors from around the world to promote learning about Ancient Egypt "( El-Aref 2003). <p> The frequently voiced claim that the Grand Egyptian Museum will be among of the world 's largest museums moves its point of reference beyond Egypt 's boundaries. The new museum aims to compete with its counterparts across the globe and not with local museums. A project of these dimensions can not be realized by one nation. In 2003 Hosni " announced the establishment of a coordinating committee made up of Egyptian and international figures, " including World Bank President James Wolfensohn( al-Ahram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and authority at least partly to the global sphere. Similarly, the financing of the project is shared by local and global sources, including the Egyptian government, investment companies, and " donations and grants from within Egypt and abroad "( Arabic News 1997 ; see also Ryan and Elbendary 2002). <p> Some local observers were critical of the competition, its results, and the winning design. One critical voice suggested that it was " unjustified to have a concrete building that is almost fully air conditioned " in a city " where power cuts are common place "( ArchNet.org 2003). Another critic added that the museum should really be located in downtown Cairo, so that it would " bring new life to deteriorated areas "( ArchNet.org 2003). The latter comment is interesting because it more closely localizes the project in an Egyptian cultural and social context, where the museum not only houses antiquities but also assumes the additional task of urban renewal. This charge is not envisioned by the planners, however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoid of direct spatial and social links to its environment, although it is dependent on its geographical environment because its plans play on the idea of proximity to the pyramids. Despite this important localizing factor, the project is largely inwardly focused and aims for an international horizon. THE FIRST MALL <p> Monday, 21 July 2003. It is 1:00 p.m. on a hot Cairo summer day. I am walking south on Sharia Giza on the east side of the street. Few people are walking at this hour of the day. I am on my way to the First Mall, an upscale mall that, even in its brief existence, has become a symbol of Cairo 's new elite consumer culture. Taking up the entire block between Sharia Ibn Nuf, Sharia Ibn Abraha, the Corniche, and Sharia Giza, this vast complex that houses the First Mall, the First Residences -- an upscale residential tower overlooking the Nile River -- and the Four Seasons Hotel impresses with its elegant architecture of large arched, seemingly gold-framed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not overwhelming or bulky, despite its size. Neither tacky nor plain functional, the complex reflects lessons and debates of recent global design and contrasts favorably with the surrounding uninspiring concrete facades. The structure is a novelty in its neighborhood of 1970s and 1980s high-rise buildings and a few older villas. Looking for the entrance, I am struck by the incongruity between the building 's inviting large windowpanes and its not immediately apparent entrance. I had first turned on Ibn Nuf, only to realize that this was an entrance to a parking garage. Back on Sharia Giza, down the block I finally find, among the large windows( not shop windows -- nothing outside indicates that this is a mall), a small set of steps that lead up to a few small, black, glass doors. Above one of the doors a very inconspicuous sign with letters only about five inches high announces in English that this is the entrance. No similar sign is posted in Arabic. <p> On entering the door, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a security desk, staffed by four or five people. Entering from the hot street, I am immediately struck by the change of physical environment. Gone are the heat, dust, and traffic noise from the street ; I am now surrounded by cool, clean air. After I pass the security check, I notice a Versace store on the left before entering the vast food court. Central to the food court is a fountain that feeds into a system of small waterways that form the shape of an oud or other stringed instrument. The body of the oud forms a stage for a grand piano. This stage extends into a second stage beyond the oud-body, The water from the fountain, combined with low-volume Arabic music, establishes an appropriate background for the tranquil and serene atmosphere of this eatery. A young waiter shows me to a table. As I take in the scenery and people around me I notice that almost two-thirds of the patrons are women of all ages, mostly in small groups of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I am the only person who did not immediately on arrival, as I am quickly to find out, place a cell phone on the table. The food court is beautifully lit by a mixture of artificial and sunlight that comes in by way of glass skylights that surround two large domes, each about 25 feet in diameter. The curving side panels of the ceiling are painted to resemble blue skies with little white clouds. Suspended from the domes are two giant stars. Between the tables are small, potted palm trees and wrought-iron lamps that create the illusion of an outdoor space. The menu promises international taste and expertise. The place leaves nothing to be desired. <p> I sit quietly for an hour, write notes, and observe fellow consumers. A few tables down, two young boys no older than thirteen are all by themselves. Some younger women are pushing baby strollers of the latest European or U.S. models, something one never sees on Cairo 's high and badly maintained sidewalks. A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sip coffee. The dominance of women in the food court is immediately obvious. At this late lunch hour, it seems that a number of women have chosen this space to meet up with other women for food or coffee. With its relative silence, cool and clean air, uncrowded and smooth passages, the place invites those with the appropriate financial resources to enact a spectacle of public life very different from that on Cairo 's streets. The absence of lingering groups of young men makes this an attractive place for women, both individually and in groups. By its exclusive access, superior amenities and services, and prices, the mall produces a social stage defined by its distinct opposition to that outside its doors. <p> On this early afternoon only a few, mostly female shoppers are frequenting the shops where high-priced local and international brands have outlets, or sections within larger stores. Consumers can buy Boss suits, Rolex watches, combine them with locally designed Concrete shirts, and indulge in jewelry and perfumes. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere -- all blend this mall into a coherent entity. The contrast between the mall 's interior and the outside street and larger urban context is striking. <p> The spatial context and history of the First Mall are worth examining. The eastern front of the block, where the First Residences are, is on the Nile front, which has been prime real estate since the late nineteenth century. Raafat called this historical strip " Giza 's Riverside Drive "( 1995a), where the rich and famous built their mansions in the early twentieth century. Senators, bankers, pashas, and royals all called this beautiful stretch of land home. Cairo 's cosmopolitan elite competed in the size and luxuriance of their villas. The site of the First Mall, Raafat recounted, once was the home of Wafdist Foreign Minister Wassef Boutrous Ghali( uncle of the former United Nations secretary-general) and his French wife, Louise. They had bought the property in 1919, the year of national upheaval that landed Wassef Ghali and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a local Italian architect, witnessed important political moments, such as the endorsement of Mustafa al-Nahas as the leader of the Wafd party after Saad Zaghlul 's death in 1928. After Egyptian independence the property was sold to the U.S. Department of State, which left it unused for years. In the 1970s Ghali 's villa was replaced by " a colonial-type villa " designated as the residence of the U.S. ambassador to Egypt. Never used as such, the property was auctioned off in the 1980s and " was picked up by eager Gulf-moneyed developers "( Raafat 1995a, part 6). The ill-fated ambassadorial residence was torn down for a speculative project that remained mysterious for some years. Raafat noted that " the new luxury twin tower is and undoubtedly will remain for years to come the subject of animated conversation : ' Who, from among Egypt 's rich-raft sic, new pashas and megabuck bellydancers will live there? ' What we do know for the time being is that one of the towers is earmarked to become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The tower did indeed become a hotel, the Four Seasons Hotel Cairo at The First Residences, which advertises itself as a " gracious sanctuary on the west bank of the Nile, with impressive views of the Great Pyramids over the old-growth canopy of Cairo 's ancient Zoological and Botanical Gardens "( see **38;1947;TOOLONG). The hotel attempts to localize itself in a unique local position, although only the top floors provide a view of the pyramids and the zoo, far from being ancient, dates from the colonial era. Thus the Four Seasons Hotel is another globalized space. Like the mall, its entrance is difficult to find. The hotel does not have a grand lobby ; rather, it is a somewhat maze-like, totally introverted structure that prevents outsiders from entering. <p> Clearly, the site and the neighborhood have a history of cosmopolitan and regional involvement, so it is not surprising that the mall entered the globalizing circuit at an early moment of contemporary globalization in the late 1980s. Through the years the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power, to nationalist politics, and, more recently, to the newly emerging regional Gulf oil and investment economy. MENA, MUSEUM, AND MALL : EXTERRITORIALITY AND RETERRITORIALIZATION <p> When one examines globalization on the ground, it becomes apparent that the phenomenon is much less straightforward, universally standardized, and even unidirectional than one had expected. Under close scrutiny in small places, globalizing processes disclose the multiple ways in which they unfold in different and unpredictable directions. Sometimes they even fail to realize their goals. In situ, globalized projects become dependent on local conditions and dynamics, become firmly localized, and may subsequently escape aspects of their global rationales. This is not to say that the local takes over the global, but that the global becomes tied to localities or that it benefits from localities in ways that make the global more responsive to local political, economic, cultural, and social processes. It becomes clear that the global relies heavily on local or national infrastructures for its existence and survival. In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important, for these are the sites where the local defines, uses, or even dominates globalized projects or exterritorial spaces for local or regional gains that may ultimately counter global rationales. <p> Because it brings together an unparalleled scope of historical, cultural, spatial, and economic dynamics, the Mena House Hotels presents one of the most complex examples of globalization. Drawing on the majestic beauty of the almost 5,000-year-old Cheops Pyramid, the hotel represents a local ruler 's attempt to impress Europeans. This attempt was turned into an immensely profitable colonial financial venture, which gained a splendid reputation in European and U.S. elite circles. Trying to understand the Mena House Hotel in the context of recent rapid globalization, one is immediately struck by its long history as an exterritorial space. Khedive Ismail 's old hunting lodge was the product of Ottoman and old-time royal practices of building numerous domiciles for all sorts of practical uses. With the British occupation and the attempts to retrieve Egyptian debts, the lodge was put on the real estate market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view -- another indicator of its dynastic origin -- was channeled into emerging colonial and global circuits of profiteering by way of tourism. Its interlude as a private mansion was brief, for it could not forgo the immense profits that were about to come from the emerging tourist industry. To have as many people as possible partake in the breathtaking beauty of the hotel 's environment for an appropriate fee seemed to be the only and best destiny for the old lodge in a new world. The hotel entered the trajectory that foreshadowed current globalization processes decades before they were named as such. Unlike its downtown peers, like the famous Shepheard Hotel, the Mena House never participated much in the ups and downs of Egyptian history and economy because of its dramatic spatial edge. Throughout the twentieth century it remained an outpost of exclusive consumption and social life, frequented by both local and global patrons. <p> Despite its exterritoriality, throughout its history the hotel remained very local because of its unique site. It is not one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner. The Mena House can not exist without the pyramids and has always been a playground for local( and later regional) elites who spend weekends or vacations, dine, or celebrate the weddings of their children. With the takeover by the Oberoi Company, the Mena House entered a new regionality of the Indian Ocean. This is reminiscent of Amitav Ghosh 's In an Antique Land( 1992), in which he illustrated a medieval Indian Ocean regionality. On the other hand, the hotel 's history is tied to Egyptian history, to khedivial lifestyles and splendor. <p> The Mena House is situated in a liminal location. Geographically and symbolically, the hotel occupies multiple locations. The hotel has been and is simultaneously located in Egypt and outside Egypt. It is in Cairo and outside Cairo. This liminal location was best illustrated by the choice of the hotel as the site of the 1977 Israeli-Egyptian peace talks. The choice was perfect, for the Mena House is simultaneously in Egypt and Cairo yet at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban institutions. Its location on the urban margins situates the place out of the urban masses ' view and also makes it easier to police. <p> Contextualizing and analyzing the Grand Egyptian Museum are more difficult, because its physical structure has not yet been completed. Debates about its planning and construction and some of its physical features, however, point to similar characteristics. Like the Mena House, the museum is localized because of the choice of site. Envisioned next to the pyramids, one aspect of the architectural competition was to integrate the new museum into the existing natural and built environment-the desert plateau and the pyramids. The museum also reflects ideas rooted in recent experiences of globalization. It is removed from a busy urban center, thus avoiding the dust, noise, crowding, and dangers of the urban masses. Instead of fences, geographical distance is planned to keep the masses -- and, more specifically, Islamic activists -- under control. The more isolated location, as in the case of the hotel, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different level, the museum is an attempt to reterritorialize science and knowledge, especially Egyptology. Providing cutting-edge facilities and technologies, the museum is an attempt by the Egyptian government to reterritorialize the study of Ancient Egypt, which has long been dominated by Western scholars and universities. By creating a state-of-the-art hub, Egypt hopes to reinsert itself on the scholarly map not just as a site of study or a source of data but as a serious or even central participant in this scholarly field. The museum will not only display artifacts but also, ideally, convert Egypt into a research center and disseminator of scientific knowledge. <p> One danger looms on the horizon of the current project : the division of the pharaonic artifacts into two circuits : one local and one global. With the new museum 's cutting-edge and expensive facilities, it is difficult to imagine that busloads of Egyptian schoolchildren will be brought here. One solution might be that the downtown museum maintains the " lesser " artifacts for local educational purposes while the new facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, tourists, and scholars. Time will tell how these details will be organized. <p> From an analytical perspective, the First Mall may be the most intriguing of the three spaces. What at a first glance looks like just another sterile, glitzy mall for the privileged few harbors some noteworthy dynamics of reterritorialization. It is important to identify moments and spaces where the global is locally remade or inserted into emerging regionalities and the contexts in which the global is used to the benefit or advantage of various local, national, or regional interests. <p> One of the side effects of the First Mall is that it offers local designers and companies prime retail spaces in the same venue as global designers. The Concrete Company, for example, exhibits its shirts in the neighborhood of Versace and Boss, with their classy and expensive products. This provides Concrete and other local companies with the unique opportunity to boost their image in ways they otherwise could not. Local manufacturers thus stand to gain tremendously from this new location, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger political and economic context of the mall, the emergence of an Egyptian commercial culture of leisure and consumption since the late 1980s needs to be understood in the larger context of the remaking of the Egyptian state and its constituency. With the switch from state functionaries and bureaucrats to private entrepreneurs as the spine of the state in the context of neoliberal policies, Egypt 's economic and social landscape has changed dramatically( Gray 1998 ; Abaza 200l). The increasing production of consumer and luxury goods needed outlets to satisfy the growing demand. This in part accounts for the proliferation of malls in Egypt since the early 1990s. The new business elite demanded appropriate services and sites for leisure and consumption ; malls, hotels, clubs, and movie theaters were the answer. The First Mall forms part of a larger project of remaking the Egyptian state, the elite, and elite culture. As such, it is highly localized. The mall contributes to the increased circulation of capital inside Egypt. Why go to Europe or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? The First Mall and its local counterparts constitute a successful attempt to reterritorialize wayward elites and their purses. <p> The First Mall is also a site in the oil-based regionality centered around the countries of the Persian Gulf. This regionality is not only based on financial capital but also has its cultural dimensions, in that new places of leisure and consumption in the region are frequently inspired by the dramatic opulence of such spaces in Dubai( malls, hotels, the skiing project, and others ; Abaza 200l), for example. This regionality is marked by its Islamic nature and constitutes a specific articulation of a Muslim modernity and Muslim consumerism. Mona Abaza( 200l) refers to the larger regionality of the Indian Ocean when she traces links all the way to the malls in Southeast Asia( Kuala Lumpur and Singapore). Her research describes the same spatial framework as the one in which the Oberoi chain and the Mena House operate. <p> To a much more limited extent, the First Mall and other malls are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not insignificant, number of younger women who are employed in the stores. Where some of these negotiations will lead is unclear, but lower-middle-class women who work in these luxurious environments will be influenced by their presence there. Whether they will submit to various forms of consumerism or come to detest it, because its products are largely beyond their reach, is a question for further research. Despite their fortress-like nature, the new malls form windows onto the new consumer culture, through which many more than just the targeted customers peek. Simultaneously, the saleswomen insert a local element, in particular the Islamic head scarf, to this globalized scene. Elite customers also wear the head scarf, but in smaller numbers than the employees. <p> Abaza notes that less classy downtown malls in Cairo, among them in particular the Bustan Mall, opened in the mid-1990s, have become preferred meeting grounds for lower-middle-class youths. She observes that, in the mall, " cheap, popular coffee shops, Internet coffee shops, and large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class youth, who wander about in the afternoons and evenings "( 2001, l08). The Bustan Mall -- part of a larger structure, the main feature of which is a parking garage -- is located close to the elite American University, whose students have also frequented the mall since the mid-1990s. This accounts for an interesting cross-section of youths of different class backgrounds. Over its short history the mall, which also offers a place to smoke the traditional water pipe, has developed into a place where young Egyptians, especially, renegotiate and localize cultural forms and patterns of consumerism. " With loud Egyptian music and with dark corners for secret lovers ' encounters, " local youth have helped to create a space that fits their local tastes and preferences( Abaza 2001, 108). TOWARD A REGIONALIZED GLOBALIZATION? <p> The exclusive nature of globalized/exterritorial spaces remains a pressing concern in Greater Cairo, for the urban masses are barred from entering most of these fortresses of leisure and conspicuous consumption. Repercussions from these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or larger contexts. Given how centrally important these concerns and glaring injustices are, a first step is to understand how globalized spaces are created and maintained. As my three case studies illustrate, globalized exterritorial spaces are not lone seeds thrown into barren landscapes. Instead, these seeds germinate best in contexts where they find a fertile soil with previous ties or exposure to globalizing, cosmopolitan, and regional engagements. In order to blossom, these seeds -- that is, planned projects -- also need to perform local functions and be integrated into existing local, national, and regional networks. In this process of local uses, practices, and negotiations new spatial patterns and practices, users and patrons, alliances, and claims to physical and symbolic ownership emerge that are difficult to predict and frequently impossible to prevent. These developments are somewhat random and unpredictable, and their results can neither be totally guided nor controlled. The developments pull individuals into their orbit ; for example, female sales personnel in Cairo 's malls, who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as customers to the very malls they help to run. Similarly, the onslaught of lower-middle-class youths was certainly not part of the original scripts of some of the less exclusive downtown malls. <p> Most important, however, the new projects are a terrain where local elites actively negotiate their standing, in the context of the nation-state, emerging regionalities, and a globalizing world and economy. Today 's Cairene elite consumer market and shopping practices constitute a departure from the practices of the 1970s and 1980s, when the city had only very few outlets for high-priced local and global goods. A look at the wares tastefully arranged at the First Mall 's bath-and-bedding stores reveals that many of these high-quality products are locally manufactured. Equally important is the opportunity for Egyptian designers and brand names to exhibit their products in close proximity to such global icons as Chanel, Boss, Dior, Yves Saint Laurent( all of which are sold at the Felopateer Palace " Luxury and Style Forever " store, www.felopateerpalace.com). Concrete 's clothes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books published by Dar El Shourouk, local arts and knickknacks on display at Genny 's, and Mohamed It 's hairstyle establishment are all door-to-door with their global peers. In exclusive malls, the Egyptian upscale market situates itself not with reference to local competitors but in line with or on display next to global peers. If the new Grand Egyptian Museum lives up to its plans and promises, it would create a similar scenery for the scientific community, in that it would allow Egyptian scholars to work next to foreign scholars. Thus the local scholarly community would situate itself next to its global peers, yet at a symbolic distance from those excluded from the state-of-the-art facilities. <p> A close look at various globalized and exterritorial spaces reveals important processes with regard to the making and remaking of old and new regionalities centered on the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean. In an age of increasing isolationism of the United States, such regionalities may emerge with unpredictable strength and power, so they deserve further study and analysis. <p>
