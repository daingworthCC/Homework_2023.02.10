4005041 The purpose of this study was to assess the control and administration of athletic programs as viewed by the faculty. Satisfaction regarding perceived knowledge, academic environment, and locus of control were investigated by both division affiliation( i.e., Division I, II, III) and current faculty athletic board service. The sample consisted of full-time faculty members ' responses from 48 institutions equally representing the three divisions as established by the NCAA. Forty faculty members and all current faculty athletic board members were selected at each institution to receive the study questionnaire. Results indicated that the faculty of Division I institutions were significantly less satisfied with their respective athletic departments than the faculty of Division II institutions. Division Ill faculty were significantly more satisfied than Division I and Division II. Current faculty athletic board members from Division I and Division II were more satisfied with athletic programming at their institutions than the general faculty. Division III comparisons illustrated a lack of significant difference. No significant differences were found in satisfaction levels of current faculty athletic board members according to Division affiliation. Future research into faculty participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the overall institution environment. <p> There is an abundance of literature on the condition of intercollegiate athletics. Research conducted on academic achievement in student athletes has examined grade point averages, hours of credit in major, graduating times, and elective courses( Adler &; Adler, 1985 ; Eitzen, Purdy, &; Houfnagel, 1982 ; Kiger &; Lorenzen, 1986 ; Marcotte, 1986 ; Messer &; Grossier, 1982 ; Stuart, 1983). Additionally, research has explored the pressures and exploitations experienced by the athlete( Armenta, 1986 ; Miller, 1980, Sack, 1988 ; Zingg, 1982). However, research pertaining to faculty perceptions about their own institutions is scant( Shea &; Weiman, 1987). <p> The issue of faculty involvement and/or control over intercollegiate athletics has been debated throughout the historical breadth of sport in higher education. The faculty perception of the relationship, function, and responsibilities of the athletic department in regard to their institution 's educational mission is crucial. The faculty are in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrumental in the success and development of the student athlete. <p> The purpose of this study was to assess the control and administration of athletic programs as viewed by the faculty. Satisfaction regarding perceived knowledge, academic environment, and locus of control were investigated by both division affiliation( i.e., Division I, II, III) and current faculty athletic board service, A study that researches faculty perceived knowledge compared to their desired status of athletic practices in order to generate a measurement of satisfaction is certainly overdue. Methods Subjects. <p> The sample consisted of full-time faculty members ' responses from 48 institutions equally representing the three divisions as established by the NCAA. Sixteen institutions from each NCAA division were randomly selected. All institutions selected had a co-educational intercollegiate athletic program. Forty faculty members were selected to receive questionnaires by the selection of assigned random numbers applied to an alphabetical list of faculty from each of the previously selected institutions. Faculty found to have served on the athletic board in the past or have job responsibilities in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members at each of the institutions were also included in the sample. In order to determine the appropriate sample size needed for data analysis alpha level, power, effect size, and an acceptable return rate were set a priori. Instrumentation <p> The survey instrument consisted of 21 paired questions identifying agreement and level of perceived knowledge regarding athletic program policies and procedures at the faculty member 's institution( see Table 1). The available responses for each statement were yes, no, I do n't know, or no response. If a response of I do n't know or no response occurred with either of the paired statements then the pair of statements was removed from consideration. A measurement of satisfaction for each subject was obtained by dividing the number of paired agreements by the number of paired disagreements. <p> The first of the paired statements asked the subject to determine if a particular policy or procedure existed at their institution. The measurement of perceived knowledge, therefore, was found by dividing the number of responses marked either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining paired statements. Questionnaires were sent to 2121 randomly selected faculty. A second mailing occurred 14 days after the initial mailing. Analysis <p> Comparisons by division affiliation for both faculty and current board members were analyzed through the application of the KruskaI-Wallis One-Way Analysis of Variance by Ranks test. Comparisons by faculty of one division to current faculty athletic board members of the same division were analyzed by the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Results and Discussion <p> The return rate for questionnaires was 38.2% of the 2121 surveys sent to 48 institutions. The return rates by division were 32% for Division I, 37.3% for Division II and 45.3% for Division III. The 38.2% overall return rate surpassed the minimum set a priori of 25%. This overall rate of return was considered largely a result of the topic, given the current intercollegiate climate on athletics. The apparent difference in return rates between faculty( 34.8%) and current facuty athletic board members( 70.7%) was expected, due to the current boards ' obviously high interest level with the topic. However, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readily lend itself to explanation. This may have been due to differences in faculty perceptions. Faculty from large institutions may be more self-contained and have less involvement with athletic department policies. These faculty may perceive themselves with limited input and hence little desire to participate in a study examining athletic policies and procedures. <p> Post hoc power was computed for the comparisons of division by faculty and by current faculty athletic board members. Since these comparisons utilized the Kruskal-Wallis test as a statistical procedure, an F test( one-way ANOVA) was used to approximate sample size and power approximations( Division 1=.85, Division 11=.62, Division III=.74 ; alpha at.01). <p> The study examined differences in satisfaction levels( a) between the faculty according to division affiliation,( b) between current faculty athletic board ' members according to division affiliation, and( c) between faculty and current board members of the same division affiliation. General faculty by division data, as well as current faculty athletic board members by division data, were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test. For general faculty, this procedure yielded significance at the.01 alpha level. Multiple comparisons between pairs resulted in a significant difference in mean ranks between all pairs. Division III faculty were most satisfied, followed by Division II, and then Division I. Procedures for current board members resulted in no significance at the.01 alpha level( see Table 2). <p> Results of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test indicated that current faculty athletic board members were more satisfied than faculty in the same division affiliation except the Division III comparison, which yielded no significant difference in policies and procedures( see Table 3). <p> Faculty satisfaction level as a function of divisional affiliation was anticipated to discriminate athletic programing of different sizes and intensities. Armenta( 1986) also found that faculty from smaller colleges felt more positive about their athletic program 's policies and procedures than did faculty from larger institutions. McLaughlin( 1986) also suggested that institutions of different sizes are operating under dissimilar philosophies. <p> Faculty athletic board member satisfaction level, as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any significant differences. Karner( 1984) investigated board members from all three divisions and found that the functions of board members were similar and therefore did not correlate to division affiliation. Considering the existing studies on board members and the vast amount of negatively ekewed perceptions of faculty found by Armenta( 1986), the significant differences between faculty of Division I and Division II and their current faculty athletic board counterparts was anticipated. Additionally, the differences between faculty and the faculty athletic board members was in congruence with Shea and Wetman( 1987) who reported that faculty athletic board members did not represent the views of the general faculty. <p> The satisfaction level of Division I faculty was found to be the lowest of all groups( indicating a higher level of dissatisfaction). Also, this group was the only group to have items with 50% or greater dissatisfaction. Faculty reported dissatisfaction with item 3, academic eligibility requirements for all students to participate in student organizations, reflecting concern with appropriate courses, papers and tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maintain a specific grade point average was not indicated as an area of dissatisfaction among groups. <p> Item 9, faculty opportunity for policy making, indicated a desire for greater opportunity for faculty input into the decision-making process. Item 14, sport related absences : a factor in class achievement, Item 15, athletes : conscientious students, and Item 21, athletic programming : providing a positive educational experience, focused on the faculty perceived academic conscience of the athlete and to some degree the athletic department. This finding of dissatisfaction coincided with Armenta 's( 1986) conclusion that faculty felt that student-athletes aligned priorities in favor of academics in direct relationship to the size, intensity, and visibility of the athletic program in which they participate. <p> The study also examined differences in perceived knowledge of policies and procedures( a) between general faculty according to division affiliation,( b) between current athletic faculty board members according to division affiliation, and( c) between general faculty and current athletic faculty board members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as current faculty athletic board members by division data, were analyzed using the KruskaI-Wallis One-Way Analysis of Variance by Ranks test. For general faculty, this procedure yielded significance at the.01 Alpha level. Multiple comparisons between pairs resulted in a significant difference in mean ranks between all pairs. Division III faculty had a higher level of perceived knowledge than Division II faculty, and Division II faculty ranked higher than Division I faculty. Procedures for current faculty athletic board members resulted in no significance at the.01 alpha level( see Table 2). <p> The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used to determine if differences existed between faculty and current faculty athletic board members of the same division affiliation. The Division I pair was found to be significantly different at Alpha.01 with current faculty athletic board members having the higher perceived knowledge level. In the Division I and Division II comparisons no significant differences were found at Alpha.01( see Table 4). <p> The data indicated that Division III faculty were more satisfied than Division I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I faculty with athletic department policies and procedures. Faculty of smaller institutions would appear to have an advantage due to the likely greater awareness of campus activities in general. Whereas in larger institutions perceived knowledge levels are seemingly lower because of such factors as interest in athletics, professional responsibility that would cause disassociation, and role-distancing or self-containment associated with large organizations. Often a subject tended to either mark a lot of I do n't know or very few I do n't know responses. <p> Four items( item 8, item 9, item 10, and item 11) appeared to be most responsible for the current faculty athletic board 's comparably high perceived knowledge level. Item 8 and Item 9 dealt with advisory and policy making input by faculty and were expected to produce a different level of perceived knowledge from faculty serving on boards than general faculty. Faculty, when serving on boards, not only are privy to the amount of faculty input, but also, to information specifically associated with the athletic program. Item I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sort to which board members have access and should therefore have a higher awareness level, <p> The results from the comparison of faculty and current faculty athletic board members suggest that given that Division Ill faculty were the most satisfied of the faculty groups and the current faculty athletic board members were equally satisfied, it follows that Division III faculty 's satisfaction level would likely be in the same range as their faculty athletic board members. Summary <p> The results of this study indicate a difference in satisfaction and perceived knowledge between faculty at Division I and Division II institutions and faculty at Division III institutions. This difference may be explained by the essential difference in athletic programs at those institutions ; Division I and Division II institutions offer scholarship athletics ; Division III offers nonscholarship athletic programs. It appeared that Division I and Division II faculty felt that athletic programs are largely influenced by external forces( primarily funding), and expectations of success by groups both internal and external to the institution. These forces appear to have caused faculty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall institutional mission. On the other hand, Division III faculty appear to have greater satisfaction with the role of athletics in their respective institutions. These faculty perceive that they have more input into the decision-making process regarding athletics. Possible influential variables may include greater personal contact with student-athletes, less external and greater internal control of athletics, and greater academic expectations for the student athlete. <p> Future research into faculty participation in athletics may suggest appropriate roles for greater faculty involvement in the overall institution environment.
