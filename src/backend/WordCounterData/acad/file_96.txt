4014241 Section : Sky Event <p> The eyes of the world will be on Saturn during December and January. Not only does the ringed planet reach the peak of its current apparition, shining brighter and appearing larger than at any other time of the year, but it also receives the most intense scrutiny ever from a pair of robotic spacecraft. <p> From an observational viewpoint, Saturn could n't be better. The planet reaches opposition on January 13, when it lies opposite the Sun in our sky and remains visible all night. Because the orbits of Earth and Saturn are nearly circular, opposition marks Saturn 's closest approach to Earth, which is why it appears so big and bright. <p> During December and January, you can find Saturn among the background stars of Gemini, not far south of that constellation 's two bright stars, Castor and Pollux. Saturn easily outshines those two, however, and is beaten in the evening sky only by Sirius. Saturn rises in the east around 8 p.m. local time in early December and about an hour earlier every two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it already appears conspicuous as the sky grows dark. <p> At opposition, Saturn shines at magnitude -0.4 and appears 20.6? across, with the ring system spanning 46.7?. Even the smallest telescope will show you the rings, which tilt 23 to our line of sight. That hefty angle means you should have no problem seeing the dark Cassini Division, which separates the outer A ring from the brighter B ring. <p> The man who discovered the Cassini Division, Italian-French astronomer Giovanni Cassini, also lends his name to the spacecraft currently orbiting Saturn. On December 13, the spacecraft makes its second close pass by the large, haze-shrouded moon Titan. Then, on December 24, Cassini will release the Huygens probe. Huygens will reach Titan on January 14, parachuting through the dense atmosphere for nearly three hours. It should reach the surface, but scientists do n't know whether it will land on solid ground or in a lake of liquid hydrocarbons. Titan glows at 8th magnitude, bright enough to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the night Huygens lands, look north of Saturn during the evening hours. <p> Only Jupiter joins the ringed planet in the evening sky, and then only during the latter part of January. Jupiter rises around 2:30 a.m. in early December and breaks into the evening sky in mid-January, when it rises around midnight. The view of Jupiter through a telescope improves as it climbs higher in the sky, so wait until dawn approaches to get the best looks. <p> The detail you see on Jupiter should improve during December and January. Jupiter gains nearly 20% in apparent diameter over the two months, expanding from 33? to 39? across. That should make it much easier to spot the two dark equatorial belts, which straddle the brighter equatorial zone. <p> The rest of the bright planets cluster together in the predawn twilight. Use brilliant Venus, the brightest point of light in the sky, as your guide. An hour before sunrise in early December, it gleams 15 above the southeastern horizon. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wo n't mistake it for any other object. The naked-eye view of Venus will probably prove most rewarding. The planet lies on the far side of the Sun and so appears fairly small( 11? in diameter) and nearly full( 93% lit) through a telescope. Venus sinks lower with each passing week, and by the end of January, it will disappear in the twilight glow. <p> In early December, Venus serves as a guide to Mars. The Red Planet lies 3 below Venus on the 1st, a gap that narrows to just 1( two Moon diameters) by the 5th. Mars shines at magnitude 1.7, so Venus appears more than 100 times brighter. Still, it should be easy to pick out the ruddy glow of Mars, particularly if you use binoculars. Like Venus, Mars lies on the opposite side of the Sun from us and so appears tiny, just 4? across. Although Mars pulls away from the Sun during December and January, it remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracking is Mercury, and, once again, Venus and binoculars are the key. During the third week of December, Mercury rises out of the dawn to join Venus. If you imagine Venus stationary each day, Mercury rises from the lower left, climbs above Venus( standing 1 above its brighter sibling on January 1), then makes a hairpin turn before passing 0.3 to the right of Venus on the 13th. <p> You wo n't want to miss the Geminid meteor shower this year. One of the most reliable showers, the Geminids peak on the night of December 13/14, just two days past New Moon. With no moonlight, you can expect to see a meteor per minute if you observe under a dark sky after midnight. As always when viewing at this time of year, be sure to dress in layers to ward off the cold. A Comet Passes the Pleiades <p> A fairly bright comet should grace the evening sky during December and January. If predictions hold, Comet C/2004 Q2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might reach naked-eye visibility at its peak in January. For Northern Hemisphere observers, the comet 's appearance improves rapidly during the course of these two months. It moves steadily northward, from Eridanus through Taurus and into Perseus, and thus climbs higher in the evening sky. <p> If you have clear weather on the evening of January 7, be sure to look for Comet Machholz. That evening, it scoots past the brilliant Pleiades star cluster.( Use the circular star map above to pick out the cluster, which lies in northwestern Taurus.) Even better, the comet 's tail will point directly toward the cluster. If the tail reaches a length of 5, it should pass in front of the Pleiades, making a wonderful sight for those observing with binoculars.
