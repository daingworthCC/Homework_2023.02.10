4012941 THE Libra del Alboraique is a 1480 's anonymous polemical pamphlet directed against conversos. 1 The manuscript, found in the Bibliothque Nationale in Paris, was reprinted in 1954 by Nicols Lpez Martnez. It has been mentioned marginally by a number of historians, but to my knowledge has never been studied in detail by either historians or literary scholars. <p> This is unfortunate, because the Libro del Alboraique is noteworthy for at least four reasons. First, it is a literary document of engaging style and thematic complexity, of interest as an outstanding example of late fifteenth-century polemical literature. In the coherence and originality of its central allegory, which equates the converts to Mohammed 's hybrid steed, it may be unique among this literature. Second, its anonymous author 2 shows an astounding range of erudition, combining Christian, Muslim and Jewish sources to an extent that render him, and this booklet, testimony to the rich cultural diversity of Spain in the late fifteenth century. Third, the book contains an important compilation of customs and attitudes and beliefs about conversos, which adds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inquisitional documents of the epoch. Fourth, in an unusual way the book, particularly in its opening section, elaborates and combines two contradictory themes : that while conversos are to be condemned generically, there are significant differences among groups of conversos so that the condemnation should be selective. The book sits solidly in the mainstream of the anti-converso tracts that proliferated at the courts of Juan II, Enrique IV and the Catholic Kings, but at the same time it uncharacteristically argues against blanket discrimination toward the new-Christians. <p> Let us begin with this last point, the author 's ambivalence with regard to wholesale condemnation of the converts. The author carefully reminds his audience of two things : that since ancient times most Christians are descended from converts ; 3 and that conversion and reversion have always gone hand in hand. The important question is not whether one has converted, but rather whether one is faithful to the new religion. He points out that a number of Jews were converted by Christ Himself, and some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injunction to partake of Christ 's flesh they said, " Duro es este sermn, quin lo creer?... y no quisieron seguir ms a Jesuchristo, pensando que carnalmente lo havan de comer "( 402). Other Jews were converted by the Apostles, and some of those returned to Judaism as well. This process has continued up into modern times. The tone of these passages does not suggest that all converts are to be condemned, but rather that the process of conversion and reversion is an ancient one. Thus condemnation should be reserved only for those people who have renounced their decision to embrace Christianity and have returned to their former practices. <p> According to the author, another difference hinges on the reason for the initial conversion. For example, the manuscript distinguishes two major types of conversos. Some Jews converted only under duress, and are labeled with the term anus/anusim, which is the Hebrew term for forced. Other Jews converted by choice, and are called meshumad/meshumadim which means, in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ con los Xrianos. " 4 This term, derived from the Hebrew root ShMD, which means to be destroyed, is the traditional Hebrew term for apostate. <p> From the second century forward the distinction between these two groups had been an important theme in Jewish responsa literature. 5 In one tradition, centered in medieval France and Germany, the sincere convert was considered an outright traitor, to be shunned by the Jewish community. In contrast the person who converted under duress - generally called in Hebrew anus( the forced one) -, while he could be considered a deserter from the obligation to sanctify the name of the Lord by preferring death to conversion, was to be treated with some respect and if possible reattached to the Jewish tradition. In another tradition, in which the Spanish Maimonides was the most influential proponent, the anus was to be praised, for it is exceedingly difficult to perform the commandments in secret, " knowing that discovery would bring forfeiture of life and property "( Netanyahu 15). @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two types were often inextricably blurred, since " Spanish Jewry had been hit by a wave of conversion already before 1391, and when the catastrophe of that year occurred, the real converts, substantial in number, were not slow to mingle with the newly converted so as to form one social entity. " He points out that in the fifteenth century fear of death or sincerity of belief were not the only two motives for conversion, and that " although fear was clearly still in the air, many were converted more out of despair than out of direct threat of death "( 16). Rabbinic literature of the fifteenth century wrestles with the practical consequences of the blurred distinctions among types of converts in decisions about problems involving the whole range of social intercourse : with whom one was permitted to eat, whom one could marry, with whom one could do business, the necessity for formal reconversion of converts, and so forth. From the rabbis ' point of view, the true converts, called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "( rashsupcim, or poshsupcim), were the despicable enemy, while the anusim were to be courted back into the fold. <p> Since the author of the Libro del Alboraique writes from a Christian perspective, the values that the two categories hold in the Jewish tradition are reversed. What is important is that the author is familiar with an important Jewish polemic of the period. 6 He understands very clearly the difference between the two sorts of converts, he labels the groups with their Hebrew names, and he understands the proscribed differences in treatment to be afforded the two groups : " Y si alguno deste linage llega algn lugar a donde hay aquesta generacin, pregntanle : eres anus, y dest christiano, o mesumad, christiano por la voluntad : Y si responde, christiano soy, anus soy, danle ddivas y hnrranle, y si dice mesumad, no le hablan ms "( 39l). 7 <p> From all this he derives an important political point : conversos are not the enemy ; judaizers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anusim, who have backslid into Judaism, are the problem. He claims that Toledo, Andaluca, Extremadura and Murcia are full of this sort, and that therefore persecution of converts from these regions is justified. On the other hand, the bulk of the converts in the northern kingdoms have sincerely adopted Catholicism and should be treated with some respect ; or at least an open mind : <p> Esto no deven de haver por reproche los buenos de los conversos de Castilla antes lo tienen por honrra, que si huviesen de ser juzgados con los converses andaluces y aun toledanos, todos seran condenados por malos erejes, lo qual no es ans mas lo contrario, ca as en Castilla la Vieja, Burgos, Palencia, Valladolid, Zamora, Salamanca y Len apenas hallarn de ellos los conversos naturales ereges ningunos, as en el reyno de Toledo, Murcia, Andaluca y Estremadura apenas hallaredes de ellos xrianos fieles.( 402) <p> Although the essential point has to do with behavior, since he argues that conversos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion, there are clear regional differences related to the circumstances under which people converted. The difference is patent : " que hasta los rsticos lo conocen "( 402). The argument is probably also self-serving, in that we can infer that the author is himself most likely a northerner. <p> So important is the distinction between the anusim and the meshumadim that the author extends it to the question of the intermarriage of old - and new - Christians. Jewish sources( such as Rabbi Duran Netanyahu 65 and Abravanel Netanyahu 186) and Christian sources( the Libro Verde de Aragon is an extreme example) 8 attest to the frequency with which in the fifteenth century converts of all stripes married into old-Christian families. While both Jewish and Christian conservatives decry intermarriage, the author of the Libro del Alboraique takes a more tolerant approach. The custom of intermarriage, he argues, is ancient and in some cases tolerable. The Bible itself states that the Jewish captives intermarried in Edom and Moab, Egypt and Babilonia( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Temple, the Jews who were brought to Rome intermarried with people of all nations. And in fact, Jews intermarried with Muslims as well. In our times he underscores that some converts intermarried with Christians in Spain out of fear of death, but others with " limpia y con santa yntencin "( 402). Again these paragraphs are most likely self-serving, for from them we infer that the anonymous author is himself partner in or the offspring of a mixed marriage. <p> I do not mean to say that the author is a converso apologist : far from it! For these few positive - or at least less negative - points aside, the characterization of conversos that emerges from the Libro del Alboraique is essentially pejorative. But by insisting that conversion is central to Christianity and that there are differences among conversos, the pejorative force of the work takes on three-dimensional complexity. <p> The organizational plan of the book is relatively simple. After an Introduction which discusses the differences between anusim and meshumadim and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mohammed 's mythical horse, and lists the attributes of the beast, explicitly applying their allegorical significance to the converts : " Las seales que dizen los moros quel Alboraique hava, nombradas todas aqu por sus significaciones, stas mismas han los nephitos por condiciones "( 392). Each part of the beast 's body resembles something else : it has the mouth of a wolf, the face of a horse, the eyes of a man, the ears of a whippet, and so forth. Some twenty-one separate characteristics are listed ; their subsequent gloss forms the longest section of the book. Each of the glosses is anchored with Scriptural references. 9 A short concluding passage lists several Hebrew blasphemous epithets with which Jews and converts are said to malign the Holy Family. 10 <p> Since the ambivalent nature of the converso is the book 's central theme, the controlling emblem of the hybrid beast is well chosen. The name Alboraique identifies the beast which according to Muslim tradition bore Muhammed on his miraculous one-night journey from Mecca to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabic name, Al-Burak, probably has an etymological relationship with the Semitic root BRK which indicates lightning. 12 Early commentaries on the Koran described Al-Burak as a beast in size between a mule and an ass, so swift that it has " wings on its shanks. " In later commentaries and legends this metaphoric reference to swiftness was taken literally and the beast became a flying steed. By the eleventh century it had acquired a human head, and in the Islamic visual arts of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries in Persia it took on aspects of griffins, centaurs or sphinxes( Paret I : 1310a). The author of the book professes to have taken the name Alboraique from popular usage, and then to have searched the Old and New Testaments for the name without success before finding it in the Koran. In Spain the tradition of the Alboraique was strong enough so that it receives mention in the thirteenth-century Primera crnica general de Espaa of Alfonso X. 13 A remnant of the Spanish visual tradition of the Alboraique survives on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cathedral of Seville. 14 From all this one surmises that the Alboraique tradition was known to Spanish intellectuals of the period, and may even have percolated into popular culture through its visual representations. 15 <p> The central point the author makes is that the converts are at their core hypocrites. Alboraique 's first attribute, a wolf 's mouth, indicates " que son yprquitas y falsos profetas, llamndose xrianos y no lo son ; ca todo aqul ques uno y finge otro es ypcrita "( 392). In similar fashion Alboraique 's human eyes indicate that " los nephitos alboraycos miran como hombres humanos, piadosos, falageos, y ellos son ynumanos y crueles "( 394). Although the conversos are broken-down nags, they decorate their manes in order to deceive people about their true nature : " andan por las plazas, ques la corte, y por las calles de los christianos a engaar a las gentes, que se figuran por las crines del Alborayque, por muchos caminos de engaarnos afeytando aquellos engaos, encrinndolos como @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this hypocritical essence more clearly stated than in the description of the Alboraique 's hide, which contains all colors at once. " Quando se hallan con los judos, dizen : somos judos, quando con los christianos : somos christianos. " In this they are like bats, neither birds nor animals : " dizen a los animales : como vos somos, ca dientes tenemos ;... dizen a las aves : como vos somos y alas tenemos para volar al cielo "( 400). <p> The author highlights the deceitful character of the new-Christians. While the charges he levels are hackneyed by their repetition in the polemic literature of the time, their derivation from Alboraique 's attributes is novel. Beneath their deceptions shines a wide spectrum of unpleasant true colors. For example, he says that conversos are cowardly, as fearful as cranes who come among us quaking in fear, and surround themselves with " gran remedio de velas y guardas "( 396). They are lazy and scorn hard work like the nags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in war or in " los trabajos speros de labradores "( 395). Conversos are dishonest : they steal and lie and cheat. They are not even straightforward about their sexual preferences, for like the Alboraique they are neither male nor female, but sodomites, damned by an ancient sin which " de los judios vino a los moros, a los malos christianos, como Diego Arias, el cual fu principio y causa de la perdicin que sera fecha en Espaa "( 401). <p> Diego Arias is the only contemporary person mentioned by name in the Libro del Alboraique, and he is mentioned twice : once as a sodomite, and once as " el mal aventurado Diego Arias,... de quien se dijo... en las Copias de Mingo Rebulgo : quando aso una cabeza y dxola bien estrujada "( 397). 16 Arias was a rich converso spice merchant active in the court of Enrique IV of Castilla. Alonso de Palencia, the chronicler who painted such a devastatingly negative portrait of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converso de oscuro linaje... hombre de bajas inclinaciones "( 40). Arias became a tax collector and administrator of benefices to the crown prince Enrique IV, with whom it was rumored, and alleged in the " Copias del Provincial, " he had homosexual relations. 17 Palencia hints at Arias ' corrupt behavior, and at Prince Enrique 's willing culpability in ignoring his crimes for reasons of personal intimacy. 18 He used his position to pack the fiscal administrative offices with conversos and, in the words of Amador de los Rios, was responsible for " insolencias y desmanes, dando as ocasin a reprensibles cohechos, robos y desafueros "( 625). It is clear that for Castilian nobility in the waning years of the fifteenth century Diego Arias had become the emblem of the insufferably corrupt, haughty converso. 19 <p> By singling out Diego Arias, the author introduces the Libra del Alboraique 's second dominant theme : converso haughtiness. In ancient times the prophet Jeremiah foretold that the Jews would display " altiveces, altiveces desechadas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like peacocks, 20 the Alboraiques are " ponposos, vanagloriosos y llenos de toda vanidad y locura deste mundo "( 396). They are noted for their " gran sobervia, lozana y locura "( 397). Their ostentatious life style is only a cover-up for their deep-rooted corruption. They fill their granaries on the sly : " sus obejas gruesas, sus hijas pintadas, palacios encalados como los templos, mas su diestra toda es de maldad y de traycin "( 395). <p> What makes this haughtiness particularly objectionable is that it is coupled with a desire to attain positions of power in order to do harm to sincere Christians. The author underscores the themes of converso greed and malevolence. Conversas delight in tormenting the souls of Christians( 396). They are eager to " pisar y sojuzgar los christianos de la tierra donde viven "( 397). Taking his inspiration from Psalm 14, 21 the author reinforces this point with repeated images of stamping and crushing : " A el christiano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ como uvas en el lagar y quebrntanlo de muchas maneras, " to such an extent that " se duelen los christianos de las ynjurias, y malos estrujamientos, y robos y invenciones dellos "( 397). In his view the conversos ' financial acumen and high position gives them unwarranted power over kings and nobles. <p> The author asserts that converso dedication to theft is notorious, and that the list of their victims includes the people and institutions most worthy of respect and protection : " viven de rapias, robando las yglesias, comprando los obispados, canongas y las otras dignidades de la madre sta. Yga "( 397). In their roles as landlords they push up rents and rob " viudas y grfanos y pobres y labradores "( 397). Using false sets of books( " quadernos desaforrados " 397) they rob rich and poor alike. According to the author, wealth and power for the conversos had become ends in themselves. " Todo su propsito y fechos de los conversos es @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curan de las riquezas espirituales "( 401). <p> Despite the author 's commiseration with the sincere Castilian convert to Christianity who without ulterior motive had intermarried with old-Christians, the glosses on Alboraique 's attributes are overwhelmingly pejorative. At their heart is the argument that the majority of conversos continue to practice Judaism. They return to their former religion the way dogs return to their vomit : " Como el perro torna al bmito y a comer lo que bos, ansi estos canes tornan al sbado y circuncisin "( 394). <p> Throughout these glosses the author describes three classes of customs : the pro-Jewish, the anti-Christian, and the mixed. With reference to the first group, conversos observe the Jewish Sabbath as well as other ritual feasts and fasts. They continue to circumcise their male children. They continue to pray in the Jewish fashion - the author uses the common Sephardic term meldar como judos( 393) - and they call their God Adonay. Many observe the laws of Kashruth. The anti-Christian practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They eat meat in Lent, and they can be identified by their " nunca confesar ni comulgar, y no guardar el domingo, ni ir a misa, no alabar a la Virgen Mara nra. sra., ni a Jesuchristo, ni leer los evangelios "( 393). Still, in most respects the conversos are hybrid, practicing not one law but rather an amalgam of all three. Nowhere is this clearer than in their dietary customs : " Comen conejos, perdizes muertas de manos de christianos y de moros, y pescado, que ellos comen poco tocino, liebres y otros animales y aves... como judos, y cmenlo en todo tiempo y en la quaresma de los xrianos y en el ayuno de los judos y en el ayuno de los moros los ms dellos, que pocos guardan las ceremonias de los otros "( 401). They do not follow the Talmud, " ni las ceremonias todas de judos ni menos la ley Christiana "( 391). <p> One of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final conversion of the Jews, which is the longest single gloss. It appears in the middle of the discussion of the Alboraique 's attributes. The argument runs like this : Prophesy says that Jews will never again have real power, or govern themselves, until they accept Jesus. They must accept the three-in-one God. In that day there will be a single law : not Jewish or Christian or Moorish but universally Christian. After centuries without God the Jews will convert to Adonay, their true God, and to their King the Son of David. All this will happen soon, after the world is destroyed by Turks and Persians : Constantinople has already fallen, and Rome will quickly follow( 398-400). <p> These visions, and this sequencing of events, fit squarely into the late medieval tradition of apocalyptic millenarianism that was common among both Christians and Jews. 22 In their struggle to understand the significance of current history, and to interpret the crises in which they found themselves, many Christians and Jews in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great historical cycle was coming to an end. From the time of the 1391 riots, Jewish literature in Spain had expressed Messianic yearnings( Baer II : 158ff ; Proceso 111). And indeed, the 1413-14 disputations in Tortosa had centered on messianic themes. Jews saw the mass conversions as a prologue to the coming of a Messiah who would deliver them from centuries of oppression. Christians put the events in Spain into a context which suggested that the final conversion of the Jews was a necessary precursor to the advent of the Anti-Christ and the End of Days that would precede Judgment. 23 <p> The author of the Libro del Alboraique is closer to the Christian tradition. He relates his End-of-Days gloss to contemporary events which he derives from prophecies in the Books of Daniel, Jeremiah and Ezequiel. After taking Constantinople, the Turks, who are the biblical Persians, will come into Italy( i.e., attack Rome, the seat of the Church). Eventually they will be defeated by the Christians. The Anti-Christ will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being defeated, with his armies, in the city of Ancona. This will demonstrate how, because of their sins, the Jews have been captive among the Christians. After the carnage the Jews will emerge in Jerusalem on the third day, and all will be converted, which will trigger the chaos of the Final Days and the Day of Judgment. The process is well underway because Constantinople, the biblical Uz, has already fallen. <p> It may be that this reference to Uz derives from the Jewish tradition, for as Yitzhak Baer has pointed out, there is a late medieval Targum 24 on Lamentations 4:21 which equates the destruction of Uz with that of Constantinople, the second capital of Rome( II : 292). Whether or not this is the case, the fact that these passages emphasize the climax of temporal history suggests that they are as much Jewish in spirit as Christian. <p> Jewish yearning for the establishment of a messianic kingdom comes through strongly in several passages in the Libra del Alboraique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, weak and pitiful as a lion without claws, a people which will never again know power or self-government until they accept Jesus. Like the cranes that come " en tiempo fro y despus quieren tornar a sus tierras, " the Jews " todava quieren tornar a Judea "( 396). 25 Some have left Spain already to go over to the Turk to help him shed Christian blood( 394). In a converso prayer, which bears an uncanny resemblance to a passage from the Sephardic Grace After Meals, 26 they are eager that God " lbranos del poder de los christianos y llvanos horros a nuestras tierras de Judea "( 396). <p> The author of this pamphlet is straightforwardly pro-Christian and anti-judaizer. Yet in some of his own attitudes he seems more Jewish than Christian. One major difference between the two religions is that for Christians, belief in Jesus is the key to salvation, while for Jews close observance of the Law is the key to achieving righteousness. The author of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judaizers than he does in their beliefs, which he mentions seldom, and only in the negative, as when he states that judaizing converso priests " no creen la sta. fe catlica ni la misa que dizen "( 397). Throughout the manuscript references to practice outnumber references to belief by six or seven to one. 27 <p> The Libra del Alboraique is ambiguous enough with regard to the conversos that historians have come to a variety of conclusions about its authorship and its intent. Isadore Loeb( 29) was the first to suggest that the purpose of the work was to lobby against the extension of the Andalusian Inquisition to Castilla and Aragon, a thesis with which Lpez Martnez( 100) agrees. He additionally suggests that the book argues for an understanding of the diversity of the converso existence, that its thesis is " hacer ver cmo la actuacin de los conversos, tan varia y contradictoria, dpende de que son ellos as, varios y contradictories "( 152). Julio Caro Baroja agrees that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time he dismisses the book 's importance, concluding that its message is very simply that the conversos are hypocrites, and that beyond that it has no more value " que cualquier otra diatriba de las que se han publicado en Espaa contra los judos "( III : 275). <p> I think the book is not so easily dismissed. Indeed, it should be recognized as an uncommonly rich testimony to the hybrid nature of Spanish intellectual society of the 1480 's. The imaginative structure of the book is rich in complexity, unique in the late medieval Spanish polemical tradition in its use of a single, unifying allegorical schema. Internal testimony suggests that the author was a Castillan convert, a person with substantial knowledge of Christian, Muslim and Jewish tradition, probably a person with some knowledge of Hebrew and maybe even Arabic, in addition to Latin and vernacular Spanish. 28 This fact alone is eloquent testimony to the cultural vitality both of the age of convivencia and the conflictive age of amalgamation which followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book is unflattering, the book also makes the point that not all conversos are the same. It argues that while the underlying characteristic of the conversos may be hypocrisy, many of them, principally in the north, are sincere Christians, who for legitimate reasons have intermarried with old-Christian families. Therefore conversos should be dealt with as individuals, and not as a class. Each had his or her own reasons to convert. Each practiced according to his or her convictions. The book does not whitewash the conversos, but it does suggest obliquely that each person is responsible for his or her own behavior, and should be judged accordingly. The Libro del Alboraique is brother to the unstintingly negative polemic of an Alonso de Espina, 29 but in this last respect it is also a distant cousin to the world of individualized responsibility that we recognize in La Celestina. Internal references suggest that the pamphlet was written after the founding of the Inquisition in Valencia( 1484) and before the expulsion of the Jews( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book to 1488 has not been challenged( 238). Sanford Shepard speculates that the book " was issued by the circle around the Inquisitor General, Toms de Torquemada "( 24). The common ancestry of all people, regardless of their immediate religious background, is a frequent theme in the polemical literature around the converso question in the Golden Age. Here are three of the many contemporary examples. In La Celestina Areusa states that " Las obras hazen linaje, que al fin todos somos hijos de Adn y Eva "( Rojas ii : 34). In Miguel de Carvajal 's Las cortes de la muerte the hypocritically pompous nun defines herself : " Soy hija de Eva y Adn ; / y si en lo del siglo toco, / llmome, segn vern, / Doa Casilda de Guzmn ; / de Manrique tengo un poco "( 16b). In Cervantes ' Retablo de las maravillas, which satirizes the obsession with purity of blood, Chirinos shouts : " Esa manada de ratones que all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ el Area de No ; de ellos son blancos, de ellos albarazados, de ellos jaspeados y de ellos azules, y, finalmente, todos son ratones "( 583a). These terms occasionally crop up in Inquisition testimony. For example : " Dixo el dicho Diego Arias que callasen, que entraba un mesumad, que quiere decir tornadizo "( 1487)( Proceso 49). Other examples are given in Marn Padilla( 123-25). Responsa are rabbinical answers to legal questions which taken together form the corpus of medieval Jewish case law. Henry Kamen points out that in the 1480 's many Christians also recognized that some converts were practicing Jews, some practicing Christians, and many in-between( 28). Evidently the question about one 's affiliation could still be asked openly, without the sort of encoded interchange we find later in Delicado 's La lozana andaluza where a discussion of recipes is used to reveal Lozana 's religious background( 53). Composed in 1507 in Zaragoza, the Libro Verde de Aragn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with conversos. The book went through numerous editions in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Of the nearly fifty Old Testament sources, the most often cited are Psalms, Deuteronomy, Genesis and Isaiah. Of the seven New Testament references, three are to Matthew and two to Revelations. Contemporary anti-semitic literature alleged that these blasphemies were inspired, and perhaps even prescribed, by the Talmud( Lpez Martnez 190). For a discussion of this tradition see Thomas Arnold 118-22 ; Parct I : 1310 ; and Asn Palacios 9-19, 68, 78-81, 377. Some modern descriptions approximate the complexity of that given in the Libr del Alboraique : an example is that of the 19th century Indian commentator Khwandamir : " Buraq was a riding beast smaller than a mule and larger than an ass, having a face like that of a human being and ears like those of an elephant ; its mane was like the mane of a horse ; its neck and tail like those of a camel ; its breast like the breast of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ox or, according to one tradition, like those of a camel ; its hoofs were like the hoofs of an ox. Its breast looked just like a ruby and its hair resembled white armour, shining brightly by reason of its exceeding purity. On its flanks it had two wings which hid its legs "( Arnold 118). " Another etymology connects Buraq with the Pahlavi barak( the modern Persian barah, ' a riding-beast ') "( Arnold 151). " Cabalgaba en una bestia que dizen en arauigo alborach ;... en aquella bestia fue Mahomat a Iherusalem a fazer oracion. Desta bestia dizen los moros que tiene alas, et aun dizen que non es bestia mas spirito en semeiana de bestia "( I : 270a ; ch. 488). Asn Palacios notes that the Koran was translated into Latin in Pamplona in 1143, that in the twelfth century the Monastery of Leyre library contained a biography of Mohammed, and that early in the thirteenth century Rodrigo Jimnez de Rada composed his Historia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrquez Villanueva for this reference. The two symmetrical figures, which are biting a human skull, appear to have a wolf 's mouth, a dog 's or wolf 's ears, a long curly or scaly mane, and a serpent 's tail which ends in a bird 's talon. Under the image is inscribed the word alboruyques( Mateo Gmez 317-19). Mateo Gmez concludes, more from her interpretation of the Libra del Alboraique than from the image itself, that it comprises " una representacin crtica, desde el punto de vista cristiano, de los conversos "( 320). This claim may be too strong, for, with the exception of the Seville miserere - of which Arnold seems to have been unaware -, the visual tradition of the hybrid Al-Burak is centered in Persia, and not in the west( Arnold 120). To my knowledge Arias is not mentioned by name in the " Copias de Mingo Revulgo. " Copia VIIIb in the edition of Eduardo Rincn includes the verses cited here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The editor notes that the verses refer to Beltrn de la Cueva( " Copias de Mingo Revulgo " 38, 184). Copla 24 : " A ti, Diego Arias, puto / que eres e fuiste judo, / e tienes gran seoro, / contigo non me dispute "( cited in Amador de los Ros 624). " Mas ni aun con esto hubiera acrecentado sus riquezas, a no acudir, segn se dice, a un crimen por dems infame, merecedor de la prisin y pena capital a que le condenaron los regidores, y de la que, ya en camino del suplicio, le libert el prncipe don Enrique, hacindole su secretario, con el apellido de Arias, y juzgndole muy digno de su intimidad. Rico ya, y favorecido como el que ms, los mismos jueces que le condenaron, le distinguan "( 40a). Immediately following this passage Palencia indicates how the " desenfrenada licencia " of the court enriched " no ya a los nombres dados a mujeres, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was later promoted to secretary and then to chief auditor, in which role he was renowned for his corruption( Caro Baroja I : 121-22). Gmez Manrique, for example, dedicated a lengthy " Copia de consejos " to Arias, counseling him to forsake the pursuit of wealth and to look to his spiritual well-being( 85a-91a). A fascinating portrait of Diego Arias as a converso emerges from the 1486-87 investigation that the Inquisition launched against his family. We learn, for example, that he acted as a rabbi, that he spoke Hebrew well, that he was circumcised, that he regularly contributed to Jewish charities, that he had a marvelous singing voice, and that he was very particular about keeping the Jewish dietary laws( Proceso 20-22, 28, 68). This manuscript appears to contradict Arnold 's assertion that the peacock tail was not added to the Al-Burak tradition until the seventeenth century( 122). Psalm 14:4.
