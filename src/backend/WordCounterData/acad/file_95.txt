4014041 Section : research update Modeling A Comet 's Collision <p> The comet fragment approaches with the lightning-quick speed of 60 kilometers/second. As it strikes the first significant amount of atmosphere, it begins to flatten, expanding sideways under the onslaught of thicker and thicker air. Within five seconds, the comet breaks apart and suddenly stops, exploding with an energy of 200,000 megatons of TNT. <p> A fireball, not unlike that in a nuclear explosion, punches up through the cloud tops. Vaporized comet material in the plume of hot gas rises several hundred kilometers above the clouds before splashing back down on top of the stratosphere. Ten minutes after the explosion, most of the action is over. Behind the plume, atmospheric gases condense, forming thick white clouds that, over the course of the next few days, spread out in a band that encircles the planet. <p> This is what astronomers think will happen when each of the twenty-one fragments of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 smash into Jupiter this coming July. The scenario is based on the results of computer programs that model what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, moving at a particular speed, runs into something with a different density, composition and temperature. This particular model was developed by astronomers Kevin Zahnle, of NASA Ames Research Center, and Mordecai-Mark MacLow, from the University of Chicago. <p> Zahnle and MacLow first met when both worked at NASA Ames, in Mountain View, California. MacLow 's research focused on the effects of shock waves from supernova explosions on the interstellar medium. Zahnle also studied shock waves, but he was interested in those created when objects from space collide with planetary atmospheres. <p> As part of his research, Zahnle created a model to run on the personal computer in his office that would test different scenarios for such collisions. " I was trying to bring organic matter to Earth safely, without it getting burned up in the atmosphere, " Zahnle says. Knowing that comets contain organic material, his program modeled what happens to an incoming comet as it travels through the Earth 's atmosphere. <p> The model was simplicity itself, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took into account friction between the comet and the Earth 's atmosphere, a second " ablation " equation that looked at the evaporation of material from the comet, and a third which described how the comet flattened and spread out from the force of the air hitting it. With his program, Zahnle became convinced that comets are not a good way to bring organic matter intact to the surface of the Earth ; they break apart too high up in the atmosphere. Venus and Tunguska <p> When the Magellan spacecraft sent back detailed radar images of the surface of Venus, Zahnle decided to see if his model could help explain the fact that there are no impact craters smaller than about two kilometers in diameter on the surface of Venus. Small cosmic projectiles striking the thick Venusian air should break apart high in the atmosphere, never reaching the ground. Zahnle changed the atmosphere in his model to match that of Venus, and tried to reproduce the observed distribution of surface crater sizes. He wanted to verify that impactors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground. His model worked perfectly. <p> Confident that his program had accurately modeled the Venusian atmosphere 's response to incoming objects, Zahnle turned his attention to the infamous Tunguska explosion. On the morning of June 30, 1908, a brilliant fireball lit up the sky over northern Siberia, followed by an explosion so powerful it knocked a man sitting at a trading post 100 kilometers away out of his chair. When authorities finally reached the desolate Tunguska River region, they found that nearly 2000 square kilometers of trees( about the size of the state of Rhode Island) had been flattened. But there was no impact crater or other evidence of what had caused the explosion. <p> A tremendous blast, equivalent to 15 megatons of TNT, detonating about eight kilometers above the ground, could explain the pattern of fallen trees and the lack of any crater. However, scientists could not agree on what caused the airburst -- a comet, an asteroid, anti-matter, a mini-black hole ; some even suggested an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happens to ice, stone and iron objects traveling through the Earth 's atmosphere. He found that comets blow up too high in the atmosphere to be responsible for the Tunguska event. Similarly, iron asteroids blow up too low, or survive their descent through the air, striking the ground. But a rocky asteroid would blow up at the right altitude and with the right amount of energy. According to Zahnle, Tunguska was most likely the result of Earth 's collision with a rocky asteroid, not a comet as had been widely believed. Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 <p> On March 25, 1993, astronomers Eugene and Carolyn Shoemaker and David Levy discovered an unusual fragmented comet, with twenty-one pieces strung out like " pearls on a string. " As astronomers studied the comet, named Shoemaker-Levy 9 in honor of its discoverers, they were startled to discover that it was on a collision course with Jupiter. Since the giant planet is gaseous, with no solid surface like Earth, astronomers puzzled over exactly what effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zahnle wondered if his little computer program could shed light on what might happen. " I was ready : to put it all away and not work on it anymore, " Zahnle says, " and then along comes this comet about to hit Jupiter. " <p> He contacted MacLow, now at the University of Chicago, about collaborating on a more sophisticated model. Zahnle 's simple computer model told him, in general terms, what would happen, but he wanted a more rigorous model that would provide detailed information about what happens every second of the collision. In his work, MacLow uses a complex computer code that models how gases move and flow. He notes the same physics are involved in modeling a comet moving through Jupiter 's atmosphere as describing what happens when the shock wave from a supernova hits an interstellar cloud ; both can be described as a flow past a round body( i.e., the comet or the cloud). To model the comet collision, MacLow says, " I took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sizes. " <p> MacLow 's model sets up a grid of points, somewhat akin to graph paper. He then sets values of density, temperature and pressure at each point on the grid. These initial values are determined by what is being modeled, in this case, a density profile of the Jovian atmosphere provided by Zahnle, with denser air on the bottom, and rarefied air on top. MacLow then adds a small region of different density, temperature and pressure to mark where the comet is, and starts the program. <p> Using equations that describe how gas flows, the model calculates how all of the parameters for each point change, given the influence of all the other points. For example, gas will tend to move from areas of high pressure to low pressure, and densities and pressures are influenced by temperature, and vice versa. It then recalculates everything again, taking account of the changes from the previous step. It repeats this process of calculation and recalculation of these values for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The grid in MacLow and Zahnle 's model encompassed half a million points. Because of the sheer number of computations involved, they used a Cray C-90 supercomputer at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. The model ran for ten hours on the supercomputer before it was finished. For an idea of how precious such supercomputer time is, MacLow notes, keep in mind that most astronomers who apply for time on supercomputers are allotted only a few hundred to a thousand hours to be used during an entire year. Running his model just once used up a fair chunck of a yearly allotment. Where It Blows Up <p> Zahnle and MacLow 's model suggests that two seconds after encountering the outermost fringes of Jupiter 's atmosphere, a one-kilometer-sized comet fragment, with a density like that of ice, will begin to break apart. Within three more seconds, it explosively halts, depositing all of its energy of motion into the Jovian atmosphere. By then it is below Jupiter 's ammonia and water clouds, roughly one hundred kilometers underneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure at this point is about eight bars, or eight times the air pressure at the surface of the Earth. Exactly where the comet detonates depends on its size and density ; larger or denser fragments can travel deeper into Jupiter 's atmosphere before explosively disintegrating. <p> One problem all collision modelers face is that no one is sure exactly how big the comet fragments are. Original estimates of 15 kilometers quickly were refined downward. Today, the best guesses range from four kilometers to about 100 meters, depending on who you ask. " My feeling is that one kilometer is the order of magnitude, " Zahnle says. " People want three kilometers, but they 're not going to get it. " <p> Because of this uncertainty in size, competing models developed by various groups of astronomers assume different sizes for the comet fragments and can not be compared directly. " For whatever reason, small objects have not been popular to run, and most people have preferred to blow up really big things, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the liberal side. It turns out we 're the most conservative. Everyone else is blowing up bigger stuff than we are. " <p> He is not convinced that observers will be able to pin down the comet fragments ' sizes before the collision. One problem is disentangling the fragments themselves from the glowing cloud of gas surrounding each in images of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9. Even afterward, information from the explosion probably will not answer the question. " I suspect there 's enough differences between the different plausible models, that the explosion... will not be diagnostic for size, " he says. " The temperature of the explosion might be, but that 's another matter and something that I 'm working on. " <p> Within thirty seconds of the explosion, a fireball of hot, vaporized comet material mixed with gases from Jupiter 's atmosphere will punch through the cloud tops and become briefly visible. Heated to 30,000 K by the comet 's explosion, the hot gas will have expanded and cooled by the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redder than the Sun, with a temperature of about 3000 K. The fireball will rise about 100 kilometers above the clouds before its density drops so much that it becomes transparent. The plume of cometary material and Jovian gases will continue to rise, perhaps as high as a thousand kilometers, before beginning to fall back down on top of Jupiter 's clouds about five minutes later. The falling hot gases in the plume generate a shock wave when they hit Jupiter 's stratosphere, heating the gas and causing it to rise again. The hot plume then falls back down, etc. " The stratosphere will bounce up, and it will come down again, up and down, splash, splash, " Zahnle says, until things finally settle down about ten minutes after the impactor 's explosion. What Will We See <p> Virtually all of the material from the comet ends up in the plume of hot gas, splashing about on top of Jupiter 's clouds, spread some 20004000 kilometers from the point of impact. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cometary material escapes into outer space. According to Zahnle, " In a sense, you 're taking the comet and spreading it over the top of a region of Jupiter 's atmosphere and making it hot. " These hot gases should emit infrared radiation which can be studied by astronomers, yielding information about the impacting comet. <p> Within about 20 minutes after the comet 's explosion, new clouds may form in Jupiter 's atmosphere. " Large parts of the plume, particularly parts of the plume which are almost 100% Jovian no cometary material, " Zahnle says, " get lifted above the planet and they become very low pressure and very cold. Volatiles such as water and ammonia from Jupiter 's atmosphere contained in the plume will condense out. " Over the course of the next few days, the ' new clouds will likely spread out farther from the point of impact. " There 's lots of these events occurring all at the same latitude, so you might end up getting a white band, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, pretty much spread out over that whole latitude zone. " <p> Other effects may or may not be visible to observers on Earth. An hour or so after the detonation, seismic waves, similar to those from terrestrial earthquakes, driven by shock waves from the comet 's explosion moving downward through the planet, should be detected over much of the planet by infrared telescopes. A day later, gravity waves may start propagating out from the site of impact, like " ripples in a pond, " according to MacLow. But he doubts they will be strong enough to be seen. The Plume, The Plume <p> Zahnle and MacLow are not the only researchers modeling what will happen when Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 smashes into Jupiter. As competing groups publish their results, the two astronomers will continue to refine their own model. Over the next few months, they plan to concentrate on what happens during the first hour after the explosion, and especially to the plume in the first ten minutes, as it rises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their diverse experiences with shock waves, Venus, Tunguska, supernovae and interstellar clouds, the two astronomers are confident they can shed light on what will happen over the six day period beginning July 16, 1994 when twenty-one pieces of a comet smash into Jupiter. <p> PHOTO( BLACK &; WHITE) : Artist 's conception of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 's collision with Jupiter, as viewed from the perspective of the Galileo spacecraft.
