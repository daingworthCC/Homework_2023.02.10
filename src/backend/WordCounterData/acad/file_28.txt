4003741 In his journal entry for March 2, 1835, the Reverend John Dunbar, missionary to the Pawnee, described the Indian women as " mere slaves " condemned to a " laborious " life and banished to the cold part of the lodge beyond the glow of the fire. The Pawnee men, Dunbar reported, were " abominably lazy, " expending energy only on the " sport " of hunting or raiding.( n1) About a century later, the feminist anthropologist Gene Weltfish, in her brilliant reconstruction of a year( 1867) in the life of the Pawnee, concluded that the situation of men and women in traditional Pawnee society was " decidedly more balanced " than in contemporary American society.( n2) <p> Which depiction is correct? The postmodernist historian F. R. Ankersmit would say neither, because he would reason that the depictions reveal nothing about Pawnee men and women and everything about the observers. Ankersmit refers to this epistemological inevitability as the " contemporization of the historical source. " Yet Ankersmit also writes that " what is most characteristic of a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period itself. It is not revealed until after the period has come to an end. " In this case, Weltfish 's assessment, while no doubt also an " allegorical creation for a human purpose, " is likely to be more representative of past reality than Dunbar 's idea.( n3) <p> With this in mind, my first objective is to go behind the statements of early nineteenth-century observers like Dunbar to try to understand their angle of vision, and hence their conclusions, regarding the roles and status of men and women in the Pawnee and Omaha nations of nineteenth-century Nebraska. <p> My second objective is to take advantage of the privilege of historical hindsight to identify empirical evidence, drawn from activity analysis and demography, which provides a firmer foundation for assessing the places of men and women in these societies. This may well sound positivistic to postmodernist ears, and no doubt Ankersmit would recoil, but even the champion of postmodernist history, Hayden White, has latterly recognized the need to establish the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge of putting those facts together into a narrative.( n4) THROUGH THE EYES OF EARLY NINETEENTH-CENTURY OBSERVERS <p> Dunbar 's assessment of the lives of Native Nebraskan men and women was echoed again and again by early nineteenth-century explorers, missionaries, and Indian agents. These witnesses were all men and predominantly middle-class, or sometimes aristocratic. Some, like the explorers Stephen Long and Charles Augustus Murray, were transitory visitors ; others, like Dunbar, were long-term residents. Ail depicted Indian men as idle and Indian women as mistreated, overworked, and powerless. <p> Long, for example, travelling through eastern Nebraska in the summer of 1820, remarked that the Indian men were " without exception, addicted to habits of extreme indolence " while the women performed all the " domestic drudgery. " Similarly, the British traveller, Murray, who visited the Pawnee villages in 1835, concluded that the women 's lives were characterized by " perpetual degradation and slavery. " Murray was perplexed, however, by the way the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n5) <p> To Euroamericans like Murray and Long, this seeming mistreatment of women was confirmation of the uncivilized state of Indian life. The Moravian missionaries Gottlieb Oehler and David Smith, who journeyed to the Pawnee villages in 1851, explained this connection : <p> The more enlightened people become through the benign influence of religion and the cultivation of the arts and sciences the more the weaker sex attains to that role in society that the Creator intended for them ; but the more debased and sunk in Heathenism a Nation lies, the more is the woman enslaved and held in subjection.( n6) <p> The American ideal( and apparently the Creator 's too) was the cloistered, protected woman, practicing the " culture of true womanhood, " a life of piety, purity, and domesticity. Her place was in the home, not in the fields, and her situtation, as de Tocqueville observed, was one of " extreme dependence. "( n7) Indian women 's heavy labor was an affront to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This assumed low status also was confirmed by the men 's obvious domination of political and religious power. Consequently, federal Indian policy throughout the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth century was aimed at reversing the Indians ' traditional gender roles by transforming the men into yeoman farmers and the women into housewives. The policy failed. <p> Ankersmit, citing Foucault, urges that we should pay attention to what is not said in historians ' accounts.( n8) In this respect it is worth noting that many nineteenth-century American women fell outside this hallowed sphere of domesticity. Frontier women were hardly cloistered( though possibly isolated), and they often shared what were regarded as men 's roles ; and in 1846 two-thirds of the workers in the Lowell, Mass., textile mills were women and girls. Among Americans, their rate of tuberculosis infection was second only to that of Native Americans.( n9) <p> The stereotype of the subordinated Indian woman has been persistent. It 's in Margaret Mead 's 1932 ethnography of the Omaha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the summer of 1930. In Mead 's view, in traditional Omaha society women did all the work yet had no power or respect. " Economically, " Mead writes, " women played a background part, " and although a few women were members of secret societies, their roles were " pallid versions of the men 's. " Mead 's Omaha women walked a few paces behind " their men, " their eyes fixed " meekly " on the ground.( n10) <p> How can such a depiction be accounted for, fifty years after Alice Fletcher had observed that much of the livelihood of the Omaha depended on the women 's labors, for which they were held in high regard?( n11) Perhaps it comes from Mead 's jaundiced view of a people who would not give her information without payment. Perhaps it stems from the fact that Mead was an elitist, not a feminist, who believed that it was women 's own fault if they had n't improved their lot.( n12) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her work on the Pawnee, illustrates that, contrary to some postmodernist thinking, we are not merely ciphers for our times, with. our histories being written through us, but also individuals, asking different questions, adopting different styles, coming to different conclusions. <p> No one, from early nineteenth-century male travellers to twentieth-century feminist anthropologists, denies that Indian women worked hard or that Indian men wielded society-wide political power. What is at issue is whether Indian women were respected for their work and whether Indian men contributed equally to the day-to-day functioning of the society. <p> These issues can, perhaps, be resolved by itemizing men 's and women 's activites in nineteenth century Pawnee and Omaha societies and by analyzing changes in their demographic structures as statistical evidence pointing to a judicious balance of roles and responsibilities in everday life. ACTIVITES, ROLES, AND STATUS <p> The information on activities( Table 1) is drawn mainly from Weltfish 's study of the Pawnee, Fletcher and LaFlesche 's study of the Omaha, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( n13) In keeping with the critical stance of the postmodernist historian, and accepting that " the study of the past is never innocent, " these authors and their feasible biases must first be previewed.( n14) <p> Alice Fletcher and Gene Weltfish had much in common. They were feminists who were alienated from an American society that had mistreated them. They sought refuge by re-creating the distant world of nineteenth-century Indian society, establishing close connections with Indian men( Francis LaFlesche in Fletcher 's case, Mark Evarts in Weltfish 's) who helped them record the old ways before they faded from memory. Perhaps they idealized traditional Pawnee and Omaha life, particularly women 's roles, seeking there a dignity that they found lacking in their own society. Joan Wallach Scott has recently pointed to this risk of conflating the " valuation of women 's experience " with the " positive assessment of everything women said or did. "( n15) But their books are richly detailed, and the Indians ' own voices are heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murie, the mixed-blood Pawnee who devoted his life to recording the elaborate ceremonies of his people, writing down what previously had only been spoken. Murie worked with Fletcher( and later with Clark Wissler), and after Murie 's death Weltfish used her knowledge of the Pawnee language to translate and transcribe his texts.( n16) These are the classic works of Omaha and Pawnee ethnography. <p> Women 's work was arduous and perennial. The women erected and dismantled the tipis, built and repaired the lodges, produced the staple crops, collected wild plants, hauled fuel and water, dug and transported salt, processed skins and furs, bore and raised children, and in general looked after the household. This heavy work load actually increased during the early nineteenth-century as the fur trade raised the demand for dressed skins. Women also carried heavy loads on the long bison hunts, especially if the family was poor and owned few horses. The work was, of course, communal, because polygamy, especially sororal polygamy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the household. <p> It is equally true that Indian women lacked formal political power and played a subordinate role in ceremonial life. Only one Pawnee ceremony-the Corn Planting Ceremony-included women in a major role, but even in this case male priests were in charge of the proceedings. Later, in dealings with the American government through treaties, annuity payments, and even in the allocation of allotments, it was Indian men, not women, who represented their societies. This, of course, reveals as much of American norms as it does of Indian society. <p> Yet in the lodge, and in other contexts, too, women had positions of authority and respect. In Pawnee and Omaha societies( and among the Ponca and Otoe-Missouria too, the other indigenous peoples of eastern Nebraska), the lodge, tipi, and most of their contents were the women 's, a right of property ownership that married American women did not have until after the 1830s.( n17) The women also owned the fields, seeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had the right to trade these products. Women often made the decisions on where to camp on the bison hunts and where, specifically, to pitch the tipis in relation to those of other clan members. The senior wife was the main decision maker in the lodge and controlled the distribution of food. A woman had the right to refuse to marry a man selected by her parents, and she also had the right to divorce. Since the woman owned the lodge, an unkind husband often found himself homeless with only his weapons, clothes, and horse to count his own. <p> Women were held in high esteem for the elemental role they played in the functioning of village life, including the production of food surpluses. They often were largely responsible for their husband 's status( and hence the family 's) because they manufactured the garments, skins, pipestems, and other products that were traded, or given as gifts, to attain or consolidate social position. Some women were especially esteemed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spoons and tipi covers. They earned additional wealth for the family in the form of fees for imparting knowledge of such skills. Women also played a role in healing, especially in problems associated with childbirth, and they had the responsibility of taking care of the religious items, an obligation of the highest importance. Finally, and surely of great symbolic significance, the Skiri Pawnee believed that woman was created first and that " through her all human things came into the world. "( n18) <p> The conclusion is that Indian women 's roles, while different from the men 's, were no less valued. Fletcher and LaFlesche explained this : <p> The Omaha woman worked hard.... In return she was regarded with esteem, her wishes were respected, and, while she held no public office, many of the movements and ceremonies of the tribe depended on her timely assistance. In the family she was generally the center of much affection.( n19) <p> The ethnologist James Owen Dorsey, who lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing that " the woman had an equal standing to the man in society " and " always did the work of her own accord. "( n20) Dorsey, like Fletcher and LaFlesche and Weltfish, was harkening back to earlier times when he wrote this. By the 1880s, with men 's traditional roles increasingly defunct, the weight of supporting the people fell increasingly upon the women, and their relative power in the society may have increased. This process of role reversal has continued through to today.( n21) DEMOGRAPHY AND THE FATAL CONTRIBUTION OF INDIAN MEN <p> Weltfish, Fletcher and LaFlesche, and Dorsey all make a point of stressing that, contrary to early nineteenth-century stereotypes, Indian men Worked hard. " The life of a man was not an idle one, " wrote Fletcher and LaFlesche, " for want and danger were never far distant, and plenty and peace for the family and the tribe depended on his industry, skill, and courage. " Dorsey came to the same conclusion : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man was not accustomed to lead an idle life. "( n22) <p> Men were responsible for hunting, defensive and aggressive warfare, manufacture of weapons, and nearly all society-wide political and religious operations. The division of labor had some flexibility, and men would help with heavy work, such as lodge construction, and there were many instances of women helping defend the village. The complementary nature of the roles, and the high status that went with being a skilled farmer as well as successful hunter, was missed by the early nineteenth-century observers. <p> Part of the problem was that these observers generally saw the men at the villages, not out on the range. Henry Carlton, who led a military expedition to the Pawnee in 1844, drew his conclusions from the village scene : <p> Go into the village at any time of the day, and you will find the men entirely idle ; there may be here and there one or two who will be making a bow or sharpening a lance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, or talking politics, while all the women will be engaged at something.( n23) <p> Men 's work took place away from the village : journeying on foot to raid for horses as far away as Santa Fe( in the case of the Pawnee), hunting on an increasingly contested bison range, and striking deep into the heart of enemy territory to prove courage, gain wealth, or retaliate for past atrocities. Contrary to Dunbar 's ideas, these activities were not " sport " ; they were matters of life and death. In one Pawnee hero story, Lone Chief, son of a chief of the Kitkahahki band, is encouraged by his mother to follow the man 's path : " It is not the man who stays in the lodge that becomes great, " she tells him, " it is the man who works, who sweats, who is always tired from going on the warpath. "( n24) <p> The balance of obligations between men and women is apparent from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of sixty, worn down by a life of childbearing and manual labor ; but the men died in greater numbers and at an earlier age, victims of their dangerous occupations. As a result there were far more women than men in these societies, a gender gap that did not close until the era of hunting and raiding was over. <p> Prince Maximilian, for example, saw very few " vigorous young men " at the Omaha village in 1833, and Carlton described the Pawnee villages in 1844 as being " overstocked with widows. "( n25) Such descriptions could be repeated, though it might be suspected that the men were only absent from the villages, doing their jobs. More persuasive evidence comes from three census counts of the Pawnee, taken in 1840, 1872, and 1887( Table 2). <p> The 1840 count was made by Dunbar. For all his ethnocentrism, he knew the Pawnee well : by 1840 he had lived in their lodges for six years, accompanying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliable. Dunbar 's use of the age often to distinguish between children and adults may seem problematic, but childbearing often began by age thirteen, and boys were hunters from an early age. By 1840 the toll taken on the Pawnee men, particularly at the hands of the Ogalala Dakota, was evident : only 41 percent of the population over the age of ten were men ; the Chaui and Kitkahahki bands had been stripped of their men even more drastically. <p> As the century wore on, the Pawnee became increasingly endangered. They were shadowed by the Ogalala on the bison range, besieged by this same enemy in their villages, and left unprotected by an American government which, contrary to treaty agreements, refused to protect them. Their agent 's census in 1872 shows drastically reduced numbers and an even wider gender gap than in 1840. Barely 36 percent of the population were men. This census, based on annuity lists and in preparation for the allotment of the reservation, may be considered accurate, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between children and adults. <p> After the removal of the Pawnee to Indian Territory in 1875, the gender gap had almost closed. The 1887 census count identified every individual in the Pawnee nation, and its accuracy is beyond dispute. It showed that more than 48 percent of the adults were males, and the Kitkahahki band had more men than women. The total Pawnee population continued to plummet and would do so until after 1905. But this was the result of poverty and dislocation ; hunting and raiding had ceased and death rates were no longer weighted against the men. CONCLUSION : HISTORY AS TRUTH OR ILLUSION? <p> The British historian E. H. Carr, who anticipated many aspects of the recent postmodernist critique, liked to refer to the " center of gravity " between the historian and the facts.( n26) To the positivist historian or historical geographer the center of gravity lay firmly on the facts : their truth value was absolute and historical accounts were facsimiles of past reality. To the postmodernist thinker, like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, fact and fiction blur, and historical accounts are at best " substitutes " for the past.( n27) On the one hand there is " ontological arrogance " ; on the other there is " epistemological angst. "( n28) <p> This paper is an attempt to return the center of gravity to a middle zone between the historian and the facts. The facts here are derived from an analysis of activities carried out by Indian men and women in early nineteenth-century Nebraska and by inference from data describing the gender balance in these societies. Agreement on the validity of these facts would not necessarily lead other scholars to the same conclusions and certainly would not result in the same narratives ; but such agreement would hold relativism at bay and prevent the perpetuation of crude stereotypes such as those of the downtrodden Indian woman and the lazy and exploitive Indian man. <p>
