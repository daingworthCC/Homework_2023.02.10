4011341 Winter concert season is usually a time of great excitement. The school year has barely begun when most music teachers find themselves preparing ensembles to " Deck the Halls " in the newest arrangement of holiday melodies ; Indian summer may be broiling the classrooms, but songs of sugarplums, snowflakes, and silver bells are echoing through the hallways. <p> Yet amid the gaiety of these preparations, a troubling question looms : How can we deal with Hanukkah? The spirit of ecumenical equality forces teachers with the highest musical standards to sample Jewish music by offering up one more tired version of " Havah Nagilah " or the latest dreidel ditty. Winter vacation brings the weary music teacher not only a well-deserved respite but comfort in the knowledge that the next confrontation with Jewish music is a year away. <p> Is that all there is to Jewish music? Of course not! But most of us have no reason to think otherwise. Hebrew is a daunting and( literally) backward language foreign to most non-seminarians ; and even composers of Jewish origin( what few there seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than seek a unique role as advocates of their special cultural heritage. -Why should the average teacher care to pursue Jewish music? Addressing the issues <p> Let 's answer the question by reviewing the " facts " regarding Jewish music : <p> -- Jewish music is not a subject ordinarily discussed in collegiate music history surveys. <p> This statement can not be refuted. The typical music history survey begins with consideration of the Catholic Mass, discussing its musical development from Gregorian chant through Palestrina and the " polyphony crisis " and then progressing to the eventual birth of the contemporary Western musical era with the genius of Bach. But the Mass came from the Jewish rites of the Jerusalem Temple and the early synagogue. The first Christians were left-wing Jews whose musical and liturgical forms came not from the pagan Greek modes but from Jewish models. " A rose by any other name " was true long before Shakespeare 's day, and by his time the Hebrew " Kadosh, kadosh, kadosh "( Holy, holy, holy) had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, sanctus, sanctus. " But that 's just the tip of the historical iceberg. A full treatment of the debt that Western European music( both sacred and secular) owes to Jewish musical tradition can be found in Eric Werner 's The Sacred Bridget " must " reading for any true music historian. <p> -- Even putting historical accuracy aside( and ancient history at that!), how can we begin to approach Jewish music when Hebrew is a truly foreign language? <p> Granted, unfamiliar Hebrew characters, read from right to left, do not immediately invite a warm response -- nor do they fit well at all with Western music, which moves " correctly " from left to right. However, Hebrew can be, and usually is, transliterated into Roman characters. <p> Even Israeli musicians find their language a problem when it comes to reading music. In the heady-and somewhat fanatic -- early years of the state of Israel, many vocal scores were printed from right to left to accommodate the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no reason to reverse their reading practices ; so the pragmatic answer won out, and to this day many Israeli vocal parts -- even for a cappella chorus -- appear both in Hebrew and in transliteration. <p> Moreover, anyone who can properly enunciate the home of the fabled Scotch monster( Loch Ness) or the name of the famous Baroque contrapuntist( J. S. Bach) can handle Hebrew 's most " difficult " pronunciation. Besides, there is more to Jewish music than Hebrew. Many important folk and popular as well as classical works of Jewish music are written in Yiddish( a hebraized variation of German), Ladino( essentially fifteenth-century Castilian, with a sprinkling of Arabic and Hebrew for color), and even English. <p> -- Even if Jewish music, in whatever language, is pronounceable, how can we present it if even composers of Jewish origin do n't seem interested in Jewish music? Is there good Jewish music to perform? <p> The truth is that many important composers of both Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the list is the multitalented Leonard Bernstein, whose Symphony No. 1( Jeremiah), No. 3( Kaddish), and even Mass have significant Jewish liturgical and/or musical content. In addition, Jacques Fromental Halevy( La juive), Darius Milhaud( Service sacre and Ani maamin, with libretto by Elie Wiesel), Aaron Copland( Vitebsk), Ernest Bloch( Israel symphony, Baal Shem Suite, Schelomo, and Sacred Service), Arnold Schonberg( Moses und Aron, Die Jakobsleiter, and A Survivor from Warsaw), and Steve Reich( Tehillim) have explored and exploited their Jewish roots to enrich our concert repertory. Moreover, non-Jewish composers including Sergey Prokofiev( Overture on Hebrew Themes), Max Bruch( Kol Nidrei), Maurice Ravel( Kaddisch and L'enigme Eternelle), and Franz Schubert( Psalm 92) have been drawn to Hebrew texts and melodies -- and this list does not include a host of national Israeli composers. Advantages for study <p> But why, still, should we force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded with too many great works by great composers -- and too little time? If the question is posed from this perspective, the answer is likely to be negative. But if, instead, we ask how a study of Jewish music can help us reach a variety of teaching goals, a number of positive responses will result. First and foremost, we strive to teach our students to value music, to appreciate the many forms in which it appears all around us, and to recognize the unique attributes of a particular type or style of composition. Our studies of anthropology tell us that all civilizations have produced some form of music. The American melting pot has benefited from the influx of many disparate influences, Jewish music among them. We fall short of our universalist goals if we fail to acknowledge the contributions of all kinds of music. While recognizing the " absolute " value of music, we know-and students enjoy discovering-the many manifestations of program music in the literature. Hollywood 's recent penchant for using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to music 's power to communicate not just consonance and form, but specific moods and story lines. Who among us has failed to recognize BolEro or Beethoven 's Fifth Symphony in movies like 10 and A Clockwork Orange? How many generations have been delighted by Disney 's Fantasia? Well, Jewish music, even without text, is by definition always program music. Its extramusical mission is to connect the listener to some plane of Jewish thought or identification. Without entering into lengthy ethnomusicological debate about what makes music Jewish, we can surely agree that it is only by virtue of its thematic content( either musical or programmatic) that instrumental music can lay claim to being Jewish at all. Bernstein 's Jeremiah symphony, for example, won critical acclaim and awards, albeit for its absolute content. The listener loses a great deal, though, by not becoming acquainted with its Jewish themes -- in this case, both musical and programmatic. Among the motivating forces to produce much of the greatest music literature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationalism. Under the influence of their teacher, Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov, a group of Jewish students studying in Saint Petersburg banded together to unearth, compose, publish, and promote their national music-Jewish music. In the same way that Dvorak 's New World symphony weaves authentic and composed " folk " melodies to paint a picture of Americana, the members of the Saint Petersburg Society for Jewish Folk Music devoted themselves to first arranging and finally creating new " Jewish " tunes. Joel Engel 's incidental score to the classic AnSki play Ha-Dybbuk uses both traditional and newly composed Jewish folk melodies ; it was at a performance of this play that Aaron Copland discovered the Hasidic melody he used for the theme of his through-composed 1929 trio, Vitebsk. Joseph Achron 's Hebrew Lullabye, often performed by violinists of all nationalities, is a setting of a generations-old folk tune well known throughout the villages of Eastern Europe, but was never notated until it was " discovered " by urban musicologists on expedition in search of their musical roots. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traces the birth of a genre and its evolution from folk to art songs, from the backwoods to the concert stage. All of us who search for material with which to teach the subtle differences between folk and art music, where " arrangements " of folk song fit in the spectrum, and recognition of " composed folk song " would do well to rediscover Jewish music from Saint Petersburg. A rich tradition <p> We have only touched the surface of Jewish music, in terms of both its definition and its place in our classrooms. There is much more to say about variant types of Eastern and Western Jewish modes and forms. <p> The cross-pollination of Jewish and non-Jewish sources has led to the creation of unique new amalgams. These include but are not at all limited to Sephardic songs of medieval Spain and the klezmer music that revolutionized much popular music of early twentieth-century America and that is now enjoying a renaissance in conservatory as well as in yeshiva circles. <p> It can be most enlightening to explore the effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternatives) on a sacred tradition dispersed in a sea of disparate musical models. There is also much to discover and debate regarding the influence on music-makers themselves of a cultural heritage in which music is omnipresent. <p> Instead of limiting their efforts to Jewish settings and occasions, a host of Jewish composers and performers have contributed to our general musical culture, from Broadway to Burbank and back to Carnegie Hall. There should be no doubt that there is more to Jewish music than meets the ear at holiday concerts -- and that Jewish music deserves a year-round place in our classrooms and curricula.

Invite a local cantor to your classroom. He or she can illustrate the " leitmotives " that identify occasions of the Jewish calendar. Examples may include parallel settings of the same liturgical text as chanted on various holidays or samples of the modes used to chant from different biblical books. <p> B. Ask your theory or composition class to consider the problem -- and challenge of creating a song based on a " Jewish scale. " The best-known and most universal of the Jewish scales( called Ahavah Rabbah in Hebrew and related to the Arabic Hidjaz and Greek Phrygian modes) exploits the augmented second, lending a decidedly Eastern flavor to resulting compositions( including the familiar " Havah Nagilah ") : C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Magen Avot, seems to behave like a major scale. However, it encompasses more than the traditional octave by having accidental alteration of pitches in different registers, giving a distinctive quality to the upper register :( B) C D E F G A B C D E. <p> C. Teach one or all -- of the songs suggested here. In addition to simply covering the words and pitches, discuss the following : " Ale Brider. " This song is set in a simple minor mode. " Minor " has been stereotyped as a trademark of Jewish music. Is this fair? What nonJewish songs do we know that are in the minor mode? Do they " sound Jewish "? This song is in Yiddish( a mix of German and Hebrew) but " oy, oy, oy " has no meaning. The Hasidim( a group of Eastern European Jews who gave special emphasis to music) often inserted these " nonsense " syllables into songs or sang totally wordless melodies called nigunim, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even surpass that of words. What emotions do we feel when we sing this song? The Hasidim would also experiment with a song, singing it very slowly, then gradually increasing the tempo. How does changing the speed change our impression of the song and its meaning? " Hine Ma Toy. " The text of this song is among the most popular of psalm excerpts, probably because of its universal( i.e., nonsectarian) appeal. The two versions offered here( 1 and 2) are very different, though. Notice that <p> a. One is in triple meter, the other in duple. <p> b. One is sung slowly( andante), the other more quickly( allegretto). <p> c.
