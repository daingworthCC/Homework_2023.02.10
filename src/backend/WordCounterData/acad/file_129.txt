4018441 ABSTRACT <p> While the readjustment of combat veterans of the Vietnam War has been studied extensively since the end of that conflict, no studies have focused on the readjustment problems of noncombatants serving in a peacekeeping capacity. Results are presented from a study of the psychosocial adjustment of 121 current and former Canadian Forces military personnel who served in Vietnam as members of an international peacekeeping force during the period of U.S. involvement in the war. These results indicate that the majority of Canadian Forces personnel have not suffered significant long-term adverse effects resulting from service in Vietnam. For a minority of respondents, however, service in Vietnam proved to be very stressful, resulting in symptoms of a stress reaction called Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder( PTSD). The importance of war zone and postwar experiences in the development and continuation of PTSD are discussed. Policy implications for future Canadian Forces peacekeeping efforts are presented. <p> Canada has had a long history of involvement in peacekeeping activities in Vietnam. This involvement began with the establishment of the International Commission for Supervision and Control at the 1954 Geneva Conference. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Poland, and India, whose mission was to report and, hopefully, deter violations of the cease-fire agreement between the French and their Vietnamese supporters located south of the 17th parallel, on the one side, and the Communist and nationalist Vietnamese located north of the 17th parallel, on the other. By the end of 1954 there were approximately 200 Canadians in both North and South Vietnam as well as in Laos. A reduced Canadian presence continued for almost 19 years when the last ICSC representative departed Hanoi in March 1973. Two members of the Canadian delegation( CANDEL) were killed during this period. <p> Canadian peacekeeping efforts continued after this date, however, as part of the International Commission for Control and Supervision, which was formed following a cease-fire agreement signed in Paris on 28 January 1973 by representatives of the United States, the Republic of Vietnam( South Vietnam), the Democratic Republic of Vietnam( North Vietnam), and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam( Viet Cong). Members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Indonesia. Between the period 27 January to 31 July 1973 approximately 250 Canadian military personnel served in Vietnam.( n1) The total number of Canadians who served in the ICCS is estimated at 282 military and 37 civilian personnel.( n2) One Canadian Forces( CF) member of the ICCS, Capt. C. E. Laviolette, was killed on 7 April 1973. <p> The issue of Canadian involvement in the Vietnam war only recently has become the focus of research on the readjustment of Vietnam veterans. This article is based on a study of the psychosocial adjustment of 164 Canadians who served in Vietnam as part of the U.S. military.( n3) Compared to U.S. Vietnam veterans, Canadian Vietnam veterans were found to have a greater prevalence of a stress reaction called Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. PTSD results from exposure to trauma that is generally outside the range of normal human experience. It is characterized by symptoms such as recurrent and intrusive dreams and recollections of a traumatic event, a numbing of responsiveness to the external world( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and additional symptoms( e.g. sleep disturbance, survivor guilt, and memory or concentration impairment).( n4) <p> PTSD has been documented in survivors of such traumas as flood, fire, or rape.( n5) More commonly, the condition has been studied within a military context, particularly that of survivors of the Vietnam War.( n6) Research has not focused, however, on the prevalence of disorders such as PTSD among peacekeeping forces. <p> While the chances of peacekeeping forces being wounded or killed are less than those for actual combatants, there are still risks involved. During the first three months of the 1973 cease-fire agreement in Vietnam, approximately 7,000 violations occurred, some involving extremely large-scale operations.( n7) In the course of investigating cease-fire violations it would not be uncommon to witness the aftermath of such violations( e.g. wounded or dead soldiers and/or civilians). Past studies of Vietnam veterans have shown that it was not necessary to be a combatant to be traumatized by war.( n8) Nurses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, yet they experienced the same prevalence of PTSD as did actual combat troops. This finding lends support to the hypothesis that exposure to the violent aftermath of combat and the constant threat of danger can be just as traumatic as direct combat participation.( n9) The prevalence of stress reactions such as PTSD among CF personnel in Vietnam is unknown. Any problems experienced by Canadian military personnel as a result of their peacekeeping duties in Vietnam are likely to have been unrecognized or misdiagnosed since PTSD was not an official psychiatric diagnosis until 1980. <p> In an effort to determine the effects of peacekeeping service in Vietnam on members of the CF, a research project was initiated in late 1987. The primary focus of the study is on the psychosocial adjustment and prevalence of PTSD among these CF personnel as compared to the results of earlier studies using the same methodology with U.S. Vietnam veterans and Canadians who joined the U.S. military and served in Vietnam. Method <p> Respondents consisted of members of the CF who served in Vietnam with either the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the war( 1961-1975). Potential respondents were located by several techniques. First, advertisements were placed in the monthly magazine published by the Royal Canadian Legion and in the publication Sentinel, which is put out by the CF. Second, personnel data files maintained at National Defence Headquarters in Ottawa were searched to identify names and addresses of all CF personnel still on active duty who were formerly posted in Vietnam. Third, the CANDEL ICCS Association was contacted. This group is composed of military and civilian personnel who served in Vietnam with either the ICSC or the ICCS. <p> A cover letter, questionnaire, informed-consent form, and postage-paid return envelope were mailed to all respondents( N = 39) identified through the first two techniques. Due to concern over maintaining the confidentiality of the membership roster of the CANDEL ICCS Association, the questionnaire packets were sent in blank, postage-paid envelopes to the president of the association, who then supplied the names and addresses of individual members on the envelopes and mailed them. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked against the CANDEL ICCS Association roster to avoid duplicate mailings of the questionnaire. A total of 213 questionnaires were mailed to association members. Canadians who served in Vietnam as civilians with the Department of External Affairs were excluded from the study, as were military members who served in Vietnam prior to 1961. <p> All respondents were sent a modified copy of a research instrument entitled the Vietnam-Era Veterans Adjustment Survey, which has established validity and reliability in studies involving over 2,700 respondents.( n10) The VEVAS provides information on demographics, attitudes and opinions about the war, combat experiences, social support experiences during and after service in Vietnam( particularly during the first year back), and both physical and psychosocial health problems during and after service in Vietnam. Results <p> Questionnaires were sent to a total of 252 current and former CF personnel who served in Vietnam with the ICSC or the ICCS. Twelve questionnaires were returned as undeliverable, and one was returned because the individual was deceased. Completed questionnaires were received from 121 respondents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent. <p> In terms of demographic data( see Table 1), the respondents range in age from 40 to 74 years, with the average being just under 53 years. These respondents are nearly 11 years older than Canadians who served in Vietnam with the U.S. military,( n11) the major reason being that the peacekeeping forces were largely composed of older, experienced career officers and enlisted personnel. Of the 89 officers( 74% of the sample), 47( 53%) held the rank of major or higher while in Vietnam. Of the 31 enlisted personnel( 26% of the sample), 24( 77%) held the rank of sergeant or higher. Data on rank was unavailable for one respondent. The respondents spent an average of 26 years on active duty and just over 6 months in Vietnam, with the overwhelming majority( 86%) serving in 1973. Over 56 percent of the respondents reported that they volunteered for duty in Vietnam. Two respondents reported being hospitalized while in Vietnam for combat-related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-combat-related reasons. <p> Racially, over 96 percent of the respondents are white with only one Oriental, one Hispanic, one black, and one North American Indian or Innuit. The respondents are also highly educated, with 90 percent having graduated from high school and 40 percent being university graduates. Over 90 percent of the respondents are currently married, and just over 9 percent are either separated, widowed, or single. A total of 14 respondents have been divorced, and 4 of these 14( 29%) report that their service in Vietnam contributed to their divorce. <p> Turning to combat experiences in Vietnam, only 2 respondents reported firing their weapon at other soldiers. No respondents reported wounding or killing anyone or being directly involved in killing or wounding civilians, although 2 respondents felt they were indirectly involved in killing or wounding civilians. Fifteen respondents( 12.7%) were involved in firefights in Vietnam, while 22 percent at one time or another found themselves in a combat situation in which they thought they might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being killed or wounded in Vietnam. In terms of exposure to the violent aftermath of combat, 30 percent of the respondents reported seeing others being killed, 72 percent reported seeing bodies of dead soldiers, 60 percent reported seeing bodies of dead civilians, 83 percent reported seeing wounded soldiers, and 73 percent reported seeing wounded civilians. <p> Respondents were asked a series of questions related to psychosocial health problems they might have experienced while serving in Vietnam. Over 40 percent of respondents reported drinking alcohol often or very often while in Vietnam, but only 3 respondents reported using drugs while in Vietnam. Over 10 percent had trouble dealing with bad memories about their experiences, with 16 percent reporting trouble falling asleep and 5 percent reporting recurring bad dreams or nightmares while in Vietnam. Ten percent of the respondents had trouble getting emotionally close to others, and over 31 percent had trouble trusting others in Vietnam. Forty percent of the respondents had trouble tolerating frustration while in Vietnam and 12 percent had trouble controlling their temper. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent felt nervous frequently, and 29 percent felt overly aroused or " keyed up " in Vietnam. Only 6 percent of respondents reported having " flashbacks " in Vietnam in which they felt like they were reexperiencing events. Eleven percent had trouble dealing with stressful experiences, and over 33 percent felt that their actions in Vietnam were not worthwhile. <p> Social-support experiences while in Vietnam were generally quite good. Over 92 percent of respondents often socialized with and felt close to members of their unit in Vietnam. Approximately 89 percent felt that members of their unit understood them and their problems and were supportive. Only 35 percent of respondents reported often writing to friends or relatives back home about their problems in Vietnam. Of those who did write, 46 percent reported receiving expressions of support from friends and 50 percent from relatives. When asked who helped them the most in dealing with their problems while in Vietnam, 23 percent of the respondents reported that members of their unit had been the most helpful. Almost 64 percent reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first year back from Vietnam only 45 percent of the respondents reported positive attitudes from fellow Canadians toward the war itself, but over 80 percent reported positive attitudes from others toward their involvement in Vietnam. Attitudes toward their involvement in the war were slightly more positive( 83%) from Canadian veterans of previous war eras. Over 73 percent of the respondents often initiated conversations about their experiences in the war during their first year back, and over two-thirds reported often getting together with other veterans of Vietnam to talk about their experiences. Only 7 percent of the respondents reported experiencing negative or hostile events after returning from Vietnam( e.g., being spit at or challenged to fight in bars) that were related to their involvement there, and less than 5 percent of the respondents reported that the way they were treated by friends, relatives, or the public in general kept them from talking about their experiences in Vietnam as much as they may have wanted. Thus, most of these veterans did not encounter many negative or hostile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experience of U.S. Vietnam veterans. <p> Physical health data in the VEVAS consist of responses to a 75-item symptom checklist based on the Cornell Medical Index.( n12) The respondent indicates whether he has ever been bothered by a particular ailment or illness since entering the Canadian Forces and, if so, whether he is still bothered. These 75 items comprise six different categories or clusters of health symptoms : respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, nervous system, skin disorders, and general health. Items within each category are summed to provide total scores. The results reveal that the vast majority of these veterans do not appear to have any significant health problems. Only 6 of the 75 items were checked as being currently experienced by 10 percent or more of the respondents. These items include hay fever( 11%), high blood pressure( 11%), frequent upset stomach( 12%), frequent indigestion( 10%), hemorrhoids( 18%), and being overweight( 15%). <p> If one looks at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CF, the number of items checked as being experienced by more than 10 percent of the respondents is 16. These items include : frequent clearing of the throat( 11%), a continually stuffed-up nose( 12%), persistent severe colds( 11%) and heavy chest colds( 11%), hay fever( 16%), high blood pressure( 22%), pains in the heart or chest( 18%), frequent upset stomach( 15%), indigestion( 13%), and loose bowel movements( 12%), hemorrhoids( 33%), skin rashes( 12%), tiredness after working( 14%), exhaustion upon getting up in the morning( 11%), and being overweight( 25%). <p> To determine the relationship between physical health and psychosocial health, Pearson correlations were computed between scores representing the 11 symptoms of PTSD and all 6 categories of current physical health. Results indicate highly significant positive correlations between PTSD symptoms and respiratory problems( r = 0.28, p < 0.05) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.01), gastrointestinal problems( r - 0.40, p < 0.001), and nervous system problems( r = 0.54, p < 0.01). <p> The same questions concerning psychosocial health problems that the respondents answered for the period of their service in Vietnam were also answered for the present. Currently only 13 percent of the respondents report drinking alcohol often or very often, with an additional 54 percent drinking occasionally. No current drug use was reported. While 10 percent of the respondents currently have trouble falling asleep, only 4 percent have trouble dealing with bad memories about experiences in Vietnam, and less than 3 percent report recurring bad dreams or nightmares about events in Vietnam. Sixteen percent have trouble getting emotionally close to others, and almost 18 percent have trouble expressing their feelings to those they care about. Twenty-three percent report trouble tolerating frustration, and 13 percent have trouble controlling their temper. Eleven percent feel depressed a lot while 9 percent feel nervous a lot, and 16 percent report feeling overly aroused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having flashbacks to events in Vietnam. Fourteen percent of the respondents report trouble trusting other people, with an equal number reporting trouble dealing with stressful experiences. Over 21 percent of the respondents currently feel that their actions in Vietnam were not worthwhile. <p> In addition to noting the kinds of problems reported by respondents both during their service in Vietnam and at the present time, particular patterns of problems representing the symptoms of PTSD were identified to determine the prevalence of this disorder. Results indicate that three respondents( 2.5%) are currently experiencing symptoms of PTSD. Six respondents( 5.0%) reported experiencing symptoms of PTSD during their service in Vietnam. This figure includes two of the respondents who also report current symptoms of PTSD, which means that the total number of respondents who have experienced PTSD is seven, rather than nine. <p> By comparing respondents reporting current PTSD symptoms with those reporting symptoms during their service in Vietnam, one can calculate additional prevalence rates representing the categories of acute, chronic, and delayed PTSD. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their service in Vietnam but do not report being bothered by symptoms at the present time. These respondents may be considered to have experienced acute PTSD, although it is possible these symptoms may have lasted more than six months, contrary to guidelines specified in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.( n13) One respondent( 0.8%) reported no symptoms of PTSD during service in Vietnam but does report symptoms of PTSD at the present time. This respondent may be thought of as having delayed PTSD. Two other respondents( 1.7%) reported being bothered by symptoms of PTSD while in Vietnam and report still being bothered by symptoms of PTSD at the present time. These respondents are considered to have chronic PTSD. These mutually exclusive categories may be combined to yield an overall PTSD rate consisting of the percentage of respondents who have experienced symptoms of PTSD at any time during or after service in Vietnam. Seven respondents fit this category for an overall rate of 5.8 percent. <p> In order to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PTSD symptomatology of the respondents, a multiple regression analysis was performed. Variables representing combat experiences( COMBAT), social support received during service in Vietnam( VSS), social support received during the first year back from Vietnam( FYSS), and during the year of respondent service in Vietnam( WARYEAR) were regressed against a variable representing the 11 symptoms of current PTSD( CPTSD) measured in the VEVAS.( n14) Military rank was not entered into the equation on the basis of t-test results that found no significant differences between officers or enlisted personnel on any psychosocial health problem either during or after service in Vietnam. Interaction terms for these variables were computed by standardizing responses via Z-score transformations and entered into the regression equation. This procedure allows the regression analysis to test interactions among the variables similar to analysis of variance, but does not require that the independent variables be grouped into discrete levels. <p> The results of this regression analysis on the variable CPTSD( R-Square = 0.33) revealed a highly significant main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ < 0.01) and main effects that approached, but did not exceed, levels of conventional statistical significance for first-year social support( F1,117 = 2.61, p = 0.10) and for support during the year the respondent served in Vietnam( F1,117 = 3.53, p = 0.06). In addition, a highly significant interaction was found between combat experience and first-year social support( F1,117) = 10.93, p < 0.01). These results indicate that increased combat experience is associated with increased severity of PTSD symptomatology, and respondents whose social-support experiences during the first year back from Vietnam were primarily positive in nature have significantly lower levels of PTSD than do respondents whose experiences were critical or nonsupportive. <p> As a means of determining the nature of the significant FYSS x COMBAT interaction, respondents were divided into four groups on the basis of their scores on the variables FYSS and COMBAT( High FYSS/High COMBAT, High FYSS/Low COMBAT, Low FYSS/High COMBAT, Low FYSS/Low COMBAT). Results of t-test comparisons of the means for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combat experience with high first-year social support( M = 3.54) was associated with the least amount of PTSD symptomatology while the combination of high combat experience and low first-year social support( M = 8.75) yielded the greatest amount of PTSD symptomatology( t88 = 2.07, p < 0.05). <p> In order to determine which factors may have influenced the development of PTSD symptoms during service in Vietnam, the variables COMBAT, VSS, WARYEAR and all computed interaction terms were regressed against the variable VPTSD, which represents the 11 items in the VEVAS measuring symptoms of PTSD during service in Vietnam. The variable FYSS was not included in this analysis since it represents events that took place after service in Vietnam. The results of this analysis( R-Square = 0.27) revealed highly significant main effects for combat experience( F1,119 = 24.18, p < 0.01) and the year of service in Vietnam( F1,119 = 6.64, p < 0.01). The effect for social support during Vietnam approached, but did not exceed, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @). No significant interactions were found. <p> Increased combat experience was found to be significantly related to increased levels of PTSD symptomatology during service in Vietnam. Those respondents who served in Vietnam prior to 1973 with the ICSC were found to have significantly more reported PTSD symptomatology during their service in Vietnam than respondents who served during and after 1973 with the ICCS. <p> Although the respondents do report experiencing various psychosocial health problems, the overwhelming majority continue to look upon their service in the CF and as peacekeepers in Vietnam as positive and beneficial. Over 83 percent report that if another war similar to Vietnam broke out they would be willing to serve in a similar capacity. Seventy-five percent of the respondents report that their military experiences have helped them get ahead in their job or career. Ninety-five percent of the respondents feel that their service in the military has helped them become a better person, and 76 percent report that their service in Vietnam has helped them in this regard. In the event of a future war, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier because of their service in Vietnam. Finally, over 98 percent of the respondents feel that the overall impact of their military service on their life has been positive, and over 83 percent feel the same way about their service in Vietnam. Discussion <p> The results of this study, although unavoidably subject to the problems of retrospective reporting, demonstrate that the overwhelming majority of CF personnel who served in Vietnam on peacekeeping duty have not suffered any long-term adverse effects from their service. Although a fair number of the respondents( 10-30%) reported experiencing various kinds of psychosocial problems both during service in Vietnam and at the present time, these problems appear to be relatively minor in that respondents have continued to cope and are successful, healthy, contributing members of society. <p> While certainly not representative of other military personnel who served in Vietnam as combatants, there is no reason to believe that the respondents in this study are significantly different from those CF peacekeepers who did not respond to the questionnaire. Some respondents noted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since they were peacekeepers, not combatants as were U.S. Vietnam veterans. Thus it is likely that many of the nonresponders felt the same way and chose not to participate on this basis. Given the nature of peacekeeping duties, it is likely that the findings of the present study can be generalized to other peacekeeping forces, particularly Canadian efforts in areas such as Cyprus and Namibia. <p> The data demonstrate that for these respondents military service, including service in Vietnam, has been of great importance to them in their career and personal development. Most of the respondents look upon their service in Vietnam as just another posting. They do not consider themselves " Vietnam veterans " in the sense that other Canadians who served with the U.S. military do. Many respondents are justifiably proud of their role as peacekeepers in Vietnam, although nearly one-quarter still feel that their actions in Vietnam were not worthwhile. <p> For a minority of respondents, however, service in Vietnam was very stressful and resulted in symptoms of PTSD. The reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @), and overall( 5.8%) PTSD compare very favorably with rates found among other U.S. and Canadian veterans who served in Vietnam( see Table 2). The six groups of Vietnam and Vietnam-era veterans being compared consist of active duty U.S. Army soldiers, active duty U.S. Army Nurse Corps personnel, soldiers assigned to troop units in the U.S. Army Reserve, U.S. veterans( civilians) receiving medical compensation from the Veterans Administration, Canadians who joined the U.S. military and served in Vietnam, and CF military personnel who served in Vietnam as peacekeepers. The most comparable sample to the CF personnel in terms of noncombat duty would be the U.S. Army Nurse Corps members. Neither group actively participated in combat but both were exposed to the often violent aftermath of combat( witnessing dead and wounded personnel) and were still in danger, even though they were noncombatants. <p> One may argue that the reported rates of PTSD for CF personnel may not be due to Vietnam at all but rather to other types of traumatic experiences. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the data in Table 2 can support both views. For example, the current rate of PTSD among CF personnel( 2.5%) is virtually identical to that of active-duty, U.S. Army Vietnam-era veterans( 2.3%).( A Vietnam-era veteran is defined as someone who was on active duty during the period of the Vietnam War but did not serve in Vietnam.) If you compare the CF personnel to active-duty, Vietnam-era nurses, however, the rate for CF personnel is over three times higher( 2.5%, vs. 0.8%). Compared to U.S. Army Reserve Vietnam-era veterans, the rate of current PTSD is two-thirds higher( 2.5% vs. 1.5%). The PTSD rate( 10%) for U.S. Vietnam-era veterans who have not maintained any military affiliation( civilians) is much higher. These veterans are experiencing some type of medical/psychiatric problem for which they are currently receiving disability compensation from the Veterans Administration, which increases the likelihood of finding stress-related disorders such as PTSD. <p> Although this comparison only deals with current PTSD rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptoms in the past would have been medically discharged from the military and thus have become the responsibility of the Veterans Administration. The high rate of PTSD found among the sample of civilian Vietnam-era veterans obtained from the VA would tend to support this argument. Thus, rather than the current PTSD rate, a more accurate comparison might be the overall PTSD rate for CF personnel( 5.8%), which is indeed much higher than among Vietnam-era veterans. <p> The results of the regression analyses confirm past findings on the importance of both war zone and postwar experiences( e.g. social support) on the development of stress reactions such as PTSD. The findings confirm the observation that one does not have to be a combatant to be traumatized by war. Exposure to danger and to the violent aftermath of combat( seeing dead bodies and/or wounded personnel) proved to be traumatic for several CF noncombatant personnel, just as it was for noncombatant U.S. Army nurses. Social-support experiences, particularly those encountered during the first year back from Vietnam, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of PTSD and acted as a moderator-variable on the effects of combat experience in Vietnam. <p> Several policy implications for effective performance in future CF peacekeeping efforts may be inferred from this study. One is the need for awareness of the potential negative effects of peacekeeping duties on the psychosocial health of CF personnel. One must look beyond the obvious, traditional forms of stress reactions resulting from actual combat( combat stress reaction, battle fatigue, etc.) to the more-insidious and less-obvious stress reactions such as PTSD. Another implication of the study is the various ways in which stress can manifest itself. Although one can not argue cause and effect on the basis of correlational data, it is evident that exposure to stressful experiences may result in both physical and psychosocial health problems. <p> Personnel returning from peacekeeping duties should be thoroughly debriefed by mental health professionals and given the opportunity to work through any stressful experiences. In this regard, CF mental health personnel should be specifically trained to recognize and treat stress reactions such as PTSD. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the failure of mental health professionals to recognize symptoms of delayed stress and to develop appropriate treatment strategies. General medical officers should also undergo this same training since soldiers are often reluctant to talk about or will deny having mental health problems but will more readily admit to physical health problems which the trained physician will recognize as being possibly stress-related. <p> Societal support for the peacekeeping role should be carefully assessed before troops are committed, to ensure that returning personnel do not have to bear the brunt of negative societal reactions to their participation in such missions. Greater public awareness of the positive value of peacekeeping roles by CF personnel may also help peacekeepers cope with any problems they experience. <p>
