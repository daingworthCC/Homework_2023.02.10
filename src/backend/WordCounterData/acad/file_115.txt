4016941 MAXIMIZING ORGANICS DIVERSION <p> A recent EPA report first estimates quantities of compostables in the MSW stream, then runs through various composting strategies to determine a cost/ton basis for diversion through each method. <p> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 's Office of Solid Waste released a report, Organic Materials Management Strategies( OMMS), in May, 1998. The OMMS explores the national potential for widespread implementation of composting strategies that have been used successfully throughout the United States. These include grasscycling, backyard home composting, on-site institutional composting, municipal yard trimmings composting, commercial composting, mixed waste composting, and residential source separated composting. For each strategy, the report uses information from EPA 's Characterization of Municipal Solid Waste in the United States : 1996 Update to estimate national quantities of organic materials available for composting. Estimates in this article use information from the recently released ' 97 Update. <p> The OMMS report addresses organic materials in the municipal solid waste stream that are recovered by existing composting operations. This focus was chosen for consistency with the EPA 's characterization studies, which only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, commercial and institutional sources. Because of this focus, some organic residuals that may have important implications for composting -- such as biosolids and industrial food processing and agricultural residuals -- were not considered in the report. Information from existing composting programs was used to identify the types of organic MSW materials typically targeted by the compost strategies analyzed. The ' 97 Update indicates that over one-third of the U.S. waste stream consists of organic materials -- 28 million tons of yard trimmings, 21.9 million tons of food residuals, and 24.8 million tons of soiled or unrecyclable paper( see Table 1). Although about 11 million tons of these materials( primarily yard trimmings) were recovered for composting in 1996, most of the remaining 63 million tons were discarded in disposal facilities. ASSESSING POTENTIAL FOR DIVERSION <p> For each of the seven strategies analyzed, a review of six to ten existing operations was conducted to develop the following information : <p> 1) Strategy description providing general design features along with illustrative examples from existing operations throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limitations of each strategy ; 3) Applicable portion of the national waste stream that could be targeted by the strategy ; and 4) Cost per ton diverted -- calculated by taking the capital and operating costs from existing programs to determine a high, low and mid-range cost per ton diverted for each strategy. <p> Table 2 provides a summary of the seven strategies analyzed. One can not get a sum of the tonnage values shown in the " available tons " column because more than one strategy may target the same materials. For example, grasscycling, home composting and municipal yard trimmings programs all target grass clippings and, thus, grass quantities are included in the applicable tons for each strategy. The Compost Strategy Savings Curve discussed in the final section of this article illustrates the most cost-effective combination of strategies that could be used to capture the nation 's compostable waste stream. GRASSCYCLING PROGRAMS <p> Of the 28 million tons of yard trimmings generated annually, approximately 50 percent are grass clippings. Therefore, the available portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 14 million tons. <p> Staff time required for public education often represents the only cost associated with grasscycling. Some programs also offer rebates for mulching equipment. Cost per ton diverted through grasscycling programs can be calculated based on the program cost in the first year. However, once residents have been educated about grasscycling( the start-up program cost), they probably will not need to be educated again each year. Therefore, Table 3 assumes that the cost of educating a given generator to grasscycle is incurred only one time, and that the program 's impact( i.e., the quantity of waste diverted) lasts for five years before additional education or outreach is needed. This is a conservative estimate since most generators are likely to continue grasscycling after an initial training period. The first year average cost per ton diverted was amortized over five years to arrive at an estimated average cost of $1.03. Of the seven programs analyzed, costs per ton ranged from a low of $0.26/ton in Montgomery County, Ohio to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost in Dubuque is likely due to the city 's residential rebate program for mulching blade attachments. HOME COMPOSTING <p> Of the 21.9 million tons of food scraps generated by the residential and commercial sectors, approximately 72 percent are compostable in backyard bins. This includes all food scraps except meat, fish, cheese, milk, and fats and oils. According to the ' 97 Update, about half of all food scraps are generated by the residential sector. Thus, the portion of food residuals generated by the residential sector that are available for backyard composting is about 7.9 million tons( 21.9 million tons of food times 50 percent generated by residents times 72 percent available for backyard composting). Franklin Associates ' 1994 Update of the Characterization of Municipal Solid Waste in the U.S.( the only update that attempted to split residential and commercial data) indicated that about 90 percent of yard trimmings come from the residential sector. Making an allowance of 10 percent for large items( e.g. tree trunks and large limbs) that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trimmings are available for backyard composting( 28 million tons( total) times 90 percent generated by residents times 90 percent available). Thus, a total of 30.6 million tons of organic materials could be targeted by backyard compost programs. This estimate probably is conservative since some areas also encourage home composting of select paper and other organic residuals. <p> Costs for municipally sponsored home composting can vary greatly. Some programs include significant start-up costs associated with bin subsidization and initial education and outreach. In these cases, the costs for initiating the program are high compared to the amount diverted in the first year. But since bins typically last for seven years( and some now have warranties for up to 25 years) and only minimal additional funding may be needed to sustain the program, costs decrease over time. Although bin prices vary depending on the type and quantity purchased, they generally range from $25 to $50. <p> Backyard compost program costs are provided in Table 4. Tonnage impacts and costs per ton diverted assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bin. The programs are organized in Table 4 based on whether bin subsidies are provided. Subsidy programs tend to cost an average of $15.68/ton diverted over a bin 's useful life, while programs emphasizing education cost an average of $5/ton diverted. The average cost of all backyard compost programs is about $12.90/ton diverted. ON-SITE INSTITUTIONAL COMPOSTING <p> Institutions such as universities, schools, hospitals, correctional facilities and military installations are uniquely suited to composting because they typically generate large quantities of organic materials and have land available for composting. Institutional composting can reduce disposal costs or, as is the case at many universities, provide opportunities for research and development of new compost technologies. Data from existing institutional composting operations suggests that up to 2.4 million tons of food, paper and yard trimmings generated by this sector could be captured by compost programs. <p> Costs for five on-site institutional programs are shown in Table 5. Low-tech options include open windrow systems that often rely on low-cost inmate labor. High-tech options include aerated, in-vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Weighted average costs of low technology and high technology operations are $49/ton diverted. YARD TRIMMINGS COMPOSTING PROGRAMS <p> Municipal yard trimmings composting programs represent the most widespread and well-established composting strategy. Municipalities collect yard trimmings in many ways, ranging from curbside operations to drop-off programs. These typically target leaves, grass and brush. As noted earlier, approximately 28 million tons of these materials are generated annually. <p> A variety of factors can influence the cost of yard trimmings programs, including the collection method used( e.g., drop-off, curbside), types of materials targeted( e.g., leaves, grass, brush, some combination, etc.), collection frequency, quantity of yard materials generated, technology used for turning compost windrows or grinding brush( e.g., dedicated equipment versus existing or shared resources), and numerous other factors. <p> To develop a mid-range national cost estimate for leaf and yard trimmings collection, it was necessary to consider the relative quantities and costs of drop-off versus curbside pick up. A study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that curbside yard trimmings collection diverted approximately two times as much material as drop-off collection programs. Therefore, for the purposes of estimating a mid-range national yard trimmings collection cost, a 2:1 curbside to drop-off diversion ratio is used in conjunction with cost per ton collected by curbside versus drop-off programs. For drop-off, the cost of collection for the compost service provider is assumed to be zero since those that drop their yard trimmings off at the compost facility bear the cost of collection. For curbside collection, a cost of $66.56/ton collected is estimated -- based on a study by Barbara Stevens of Ecodata Inc. -- of 60 randomly selected cities that divert 10 to 19.9 percent of the waste stream through curbside yard trimmings programs. This estimate is conservative since the same study indicated that programs that divert larger quantities of the waste stream cost less per ton collected. Combining the curbside and drop-off costs at a 2:1 ratio to reflect the relative quantities of materials collected by each method yields a mid-range national cost estimate of $44.37/ton collected in yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, further costs will be incurred at the facility as the material is turned into finished product. A BioCycle article( " How Much Does It Cost To Compost Yard Trimmings, " September, 1996) presented the results of a survey of seven public composting facilities that process from 2,000 to 23,500 tons/year of feedstock. This survey revealed an average total cost( capital plus operating) of $PA.65/ton, as shown in Table 6. <p> Among the municipal yard trimmings programs analyzed, costs ranged from a low of $21.65/ton diverted( for programs that rely on drop-off collection) to a high of $88.21/ton -- $66.56 for collection plus $21.65/ton for composting -- diverted( for programs that use more extensive curbside collection and processing operations). The estimated national mid-range cost of yard trimmings composting is $66.02/ten diverted( $44.37/ten for collection and $21.65/ton for composting). COMMERCIAL COMPOSTING <p> Commercial generators of organic materials, such as supermarkets, food processing companies and restaurants, have the potential for diverting large amounts of food, soiled and waxed cardboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, organic residuals may represent 75 to 90 percent of the total waste stream. Data from existing commercial composting operations suggests that up to 24.6 million tons of food and soiled or unrecyclable paper generated by commercial establishments could be captured for composting. <p> The city of Seattle, the King County Solid Waste Division and the Washington Department of Ecology funded development of detailed ' cost models for collection and processing of commercial organics as part of the Seattle/King County Commercial Food Waste Demonstration Project. The collection models were based on several factors, including food residuals generation rates per employee for different types of generators, participation rates based on survey information, efficiency of organics separation by participating firms, collection frequency and container weight limits. The model indicated that the quantity of food generated at each commercial site and the distance between generators had the greatest impact on commercial organics collection costs. Collection and transport and processing cost ranges were calculated for several service areas. Model cost estimates are shown in Table 7 along with price estimates provided by other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are estimated at about $72/ton diverted. Cost per ton collected and composted( based on averages) range from a low of about $50 as reported by Shop-Rite, to a high of around $96 estimated by the Seattle cost model. MIXED WASTE COMPOSTING <p> Mixed waste composting refers to a centralized processing system that accepts mixed MSW and separates materials into component parts for composting, recycling and final disposal. In theory, this strategy could divert all organic materials currently available for composting -- approximately 74.7 million tons/year. To date, mixed waste composting operations have had an uneven track record in the United States. <p> Mixed waste composting facilities use much higher levels of technology than other organic material diversion strategies to sort recyclables and compostables from disposed waste. Facilities have dramatically different capital costs, depending on the level of technology employed and the extent of reliance upon low-skilled labor for sorting. Odor control technologies also incur associated design, construction and operating costs that vary widely from project to project. Operating costs include labor, operation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determines labor requirements. Residual disposal can be a very significant cost item, depending on the compost quality and the corresponding degree of contaminant removal needed, as well as the cost of disposal. One study reports estimated costs for capital debt service and operation( see Table 8) at a number of mixed waste composting facilities around the country. The estimates do not generally include the costs for land or siting, as the facilities are all publicly owned and land was already available.( For consistency, no land costs were included for any of the strategies.) The resulting average cost per ton is $49.89. <p> In addition to facility costs, mixed waste composting involves collection costs. However, unlike other organics management strategies, it does not necessarily require a separate collection system. Therefore, the cost of collection for this strategy is equivalent to the cost of garbage collection. Using information from a study conducted by Franklin Associates and Keep America Beautiful, average garbage collection costs are estimated at $63/ton. Combined with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $102 to $126/ton diverted. The weighted average cost of diversion for this strategy is $113/ton diverted. RESIDENTIAL SOURCE SEPARATION <p> Increasing sensitivity about the poor quality of mixed waste compost in Europe started a wave of residential collection programs targeting the organic fraction of the solid waste stream. Several pilot programs in the Netherlands and Germany in the late 1980s demonstrated that compost produced from residentially source separated feedstock contained substantially lower levels of toxic heavy metals and physical contaminants, such as glass and plastic, than mixed waste compost. Like mixed waste composting, source separated organics composting has the potential to target a large portion of the residential organics stream, which is comprised of about 47.3 million tons of compostable MSW. <p> Costs for collection of source separated residential organics are not readily available because such programs have not been widely implemented in the United States. Average collection costs for a wet/dry pilot operation in DeKalb, Illinois ranged from $48 to $62/ton diverted, according to a report prepared by Waste Management Inc. and E &A; Environmental Consultants. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dual collection vehicle. Residents were supplied with cellulose lined bags, eight-gallon containers to hold the bags, and 20-gallon containers to-hold full wet waste bags for curbside collection. On one of the two pilot routes, recyclables were collected with wet and dry organic materials in blue bags. <p> There also is a general lack of complete cost information specific to source separation processing technologies. Swift County, Minnesota built a composting facility designed to receive bagged, source separated MSW as feedstock. The cost for source separated collection and processing at this facility was compared to the cost of mixed waste composting in neighboring counties. The source separated costs ranged between $63 to $86/ton whereas mixed waste composting ranged from $102 to $126/ton. THE COMPOST STRATEGY SAVINGS CURVE <p> The previous discussion focused on national average costs and potential for seven individual compost strategies. Clearly, some combination of the strategies analyzed would be needed to address the entire U.S. organics stream. The question is, which combination of strategies would be most cost-effective? To address this question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was developed. The curve identifies the most cost-effective combination of options available for composting the 74.7 million ton compostable waste stream shown in Table 1. <p> The average cost per ton diverted for individual compost strategies is used as a starting point for constructing the curve. This information is combined with average avoided garbage collection and disposal costs, as well as average revenue for finished compost, to estimate a net cost or savings for each compost strategy as shown in Table 9.( Source separated composting was excluded from this analysis because complete cost information was not readily available.) Avoided disposal costs are calculated using national average tip fees( $38/ton based on adjusted BioCycle 's " State of Garbage in America " survey data from 1995-1996). Average avoided garbage collection costs( $23/ton using Franklin Associates 1994 data) were applied to on-site institutional, municipal yard trimmings and commercial organics because these composting programs are assumed to result in an incremental reduction in garbage collection service. For mixed waste composting, the average cost of garbage collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoided cost( assuming mixed waste composting collection replaces garbage collection). Average revenue per input ton is based on the reported market value for various kinds of finished compost.( See the OMMS report for further explanation of avoided disposal costs and compost revenue assumptions.) <p> To develop the Compost Strategies Savings Curve, savings from column four of Table 9 were plotted on the graph with applicable tonnage information shown in Table 2. The curve shows the strategies analyzed from highest to lowest savings per ton, such that strategies resulting in the greatest savings per ton diverted appear first and are applied to the total quantity of organic material available for diversion through that strategy. Any overlap of targeted materials between options is simply removed from the contribution of each subsequent( i.e., more costly) segment of the curve. Thus, for example, the tonnage attributed to home composting is net of the tonnage attributed to grasscycling and onsite institutional composting ; the three combined are equal to the diversion available through only doing municipal yard trimmings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it results in a net cost of $9/ton.( This strategy, however, could encompass the total quantity of organic materials in the MSW stream available for composting.) <p> The curve indicates that 83 percent of the available compostable stream( about 62 million tons) could be composted at a net savings through a combination of grasscycling, home composting, on-site institutional composting, leaf and yard trimmings composting, and commercial organics composting. Composting the remaining 17 percent of the organic waste stream could be accomplished through more costly mixed waste composting programs or perhaps through source separation strategies once they become better established in the United States. <p> Table 10 illustrates the maximum savings to local governments from composting strategies. Grasscycling, on-site institutional and home composting programs -- three source reduction strategies -- could target 50 percent of the organic waste stream at a net savings to local governments of over $1 billion annually. Alternatively, yard trimmings composting programs could be employed to target many of the same materials at a savings of about $240 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divert more of the organics stream( because they also include food residuals) at a savings of anywhere from about $25 to $37/ton versus municipal yard trimmings composting, which diverts less organics at a savings of roughly $11/ton. Commercial compost strategies could capture another third of the organic waste stream at net savings of about $211.5 million annually. The compost strategy curve underscores the major impact that a few proven strategies could have in achieving substantial and cost-effective incremental reduction in the U.S. waste stream.
