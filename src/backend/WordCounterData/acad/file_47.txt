4008041 In the last two decades, Mexico has emerged as one of the most important countries in the world from the point of view of U.S. foreign policy. For the first sixty years after the Mexican Revolution of 1910-1920, the United States took Mexican stability for granted, and we seldom worried overly about the large, populous, Third World neighbor on our southwestern border. Mexico was a top-down, authoritarian, patronage-based, single-party regime that incorporated major social groups into the political system ; this, coupled with an economy that expanded impressively for several decades, seemed to guarantee Mexico both political and economic stability-the primary goal of U.S. policy.( n1) <p> But it was Mexico 's admission in 1982 that it could not pay its obligations that triggered the great Third World debt crisis of the 1980s. Shortly thereafter, the political system began to wobble as well, giving rise to the fear that Mexico would destabilize or that a left-wing, populist, anti-American regime might succeed the long-dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party in power. Suddenly it began to appear that the United States could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small, destabilized, but still-distant Central American " banana republic, " but a populous( 100 million), important country right on our border, whose destabilization would have immense implications for the United States both domestically and strategically. <p> Its potential for instability, either economic or political or both, has vaulted Mexico to a position of importance in U.S. foreign policy comparable to that of Japan, Germany, or Russia. It is not that Mexico represents a threat to the United States in any classic strategic or military sense. Mexico is not about to invade the United States militarily, nor are there Mexican missiles armed with nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons aimed at the United States. Instead, Mexico is important to us because of its ability to affect us domestically in many ways. Even the slightest hint of actual or potential economic or political instability in Mexico sends tens of thousands of Mexicans fleeing toward or across the U.S. border. And that has immense consequences for U.S. school systems, housing, employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs -- mainly in the Southwest, but now increasingly in other areas as well. It also triggers a domestic political backlash, resulting in pressures for increased border patrols, immigration restrictions, and insistence on English as the official U.S. language. These measures in turn trigger their own backlash in Mexico, which exacerbates the problem and increases the pressures on Mexican stability.( n2) <p> Therefore, the best way to think about Mexico in an international relations sense is not through the lens of hardheaded, classic realism -- Mexico is not a military threat -- but through the newer prism of what Joseph Nye and Robert Keohane called " complex interdependence. "( n3) Mexico is interdependent with the United States on a host of issues : oil and natural gas, tourism, trade, NAFTA, water rights, pollution and the environment, immigration and labor supplies, banking and investment, manufactured products, and now drugs, crime, gangs, and violence. There is perhaps no other country in the world, besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on such a wide range of issues. Note that most of these issues are not what we might call " hard " strategic threats, but rather what Nye and Keohane call " soft " interdependency issues. Note also that most of these are not what we think of as classic international relations issues over power and dominance( although that is also involved) ; rather, they are issues that are both international and domestic -- what we now call " intermestic. " Moreover, all of them are hot, post-cold war, front-burner issues. <p> That means that a host of U.S. agencies -- primarily domestic affairs agencies -- have jurisdiction over and are interested and involved in U.S. policy toward Mexico. Few of these traditionally domestic agencies -- EPA, FBI, DEA, and so forth -- have a long history of involvement in foreign affairs or in Mexico ; they frequently lack the language skills, international affairs experience, or foreign policy background to carry out their assigned roles successfully. Perhaps of even greater importance, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jostling and even rivalries among agencies -- that has long characterized and often frustrated the successful carrying out of U.S. policy. We do not have a single U.S. foreign policy in Mexico ; instead we have approximately sixty-seven policies-one or several policies for each of the U.S. agencies operating there. It is the thesis of this article that the bureaucratic politics of U.S.-Mexican relations has now become so complex, so multilayered, so conflicting, that it hamstrings, frustrates, and often paralyzes policy and makes it virtually impossible for the United States to carry out a successful foreign policy there. BUREAUCRATIC POLITICS <p> In a justly famous book written some years ago about the Cuban Missile Crisis, Harvard scholar Graham Allison described the " rational actor model " of American foreign policymaking.( n4) This model suggests that a series of options, with the pros and cons carefully weighed, are presented to the president or foreign policy decisionmaker, who makes the decision based on a " rational " calculation of which option best serves U.S. interests. Allison pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rational actor model, though that was how most Americans conceived of foreign policymaking -- when and if they thought about it at all. <p> But Allison argued that at least two other " models " were also present in foreign policy decisionmaking : an organizational model and a bureaucratic model. The organizational model indicates that foreign policy agencies have habits, guidelines, cultures, and standard operating procedures of their own quite independent of presidential decisionmaking ; in the case of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Navy went ahead with its own way of blockading Soviet ships regardless of President Kennedy 's detailed instructions, even though the " Navy way " had the potential to trigger World War III. The bureaucratic model( the main focus of our analysis here) suggests that agencies such as the State Department, the Department of Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency, and others have independent bureaucratic interests( budgets, power, prestige, access to the White House) that they seek to enhance and protect, which are also quite independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted during the 1980s, for example, at the height of the cold war, State Department officials frequently lamented that dealing with the Soviets was easy compared with their discussions with a certain rival agency in a five-sided building in " foreign territory " across the Potomac.( n5) <p> In the years after Allison 's book appeared, the models were refined, adapted, and expanded. Critics suggested that the organizational and bureaucratic models operated in circumstances when the foreign policy debate was long and protracted, but that in crisis situations where quick decisions were necessary( such as the Dominican Republic intervention of 1965), the president acted expeditiously without these other models coming into play. Then, on the basis of his experiences in the White House, Roger Hilsman refined Allison 's model, added new cases to it, and explored the role of additional groups and interests not included in Allison 's scheme.( n6) In my own contribution to this approach based on my involvement in policymaking in the 1980s, I analyzed both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debt issue ; Justice -- drugs and immigration ; Commerce -- trade policy ; Environmental Protection Agency-pollution) and added two other models to Allison 's original three : a political process model, based largely on Congress 's increasing role in constructing foreign policy and the log-rolling involved in that process ; and a personal aggrandizement model, based on the rise of the self-interested " me generation " and on the data generated by political scientists, who demonstrate that if all other variables hold constant -- party, state, region, district, gender, rural-urban, and so on -- the factor that most explains congressional voting and political decisionmaking is the desire to be reelected.( n7) <p> Now let us apply the bureaucratic politics model to Mexico. In the following I present my conclusions in the form of an executive summary ; I will offer much of the data and analysis on which they are based later in the article. Mexico has become a high-priority country in U.S. foreign policy. Evidence of this includes the growing number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico issues to cabinet or White House levels ; the frequent visits of cabinet members to Mexico ; the presence of cabinet officers as ambassadors to Mexico have been sworn in( e.g., Janet Reno and Barry McCaffrey at the swearing in of U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Jeffrey Davidow) ; and the amount of newspaper attention to Mexico issues. There are more U.S. government agencies assigned to the American embassy in Mexico than to any other country in the world : thirty by my count. There are over 1,200 official, civilian, U.S. government personnel in Mexico, again the largest number in the world. These numbers do not include the significant number of CIA, DOD, and Defense Intelligence Agency personnel in Mexico. The bureaucratic politics of foreign policymaking used to be confined to three main, sometimes rival agencies : State, DOD, and CIA. Now it includes many more. There are no less than forty-three agencies involved in the drug war alone, and almost all of these are in one way or another involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mexico policy. Mexico affects their constituents and districts on issues such as jobs, drugs, trade, and schools. Some congressmen carry out their own foreign policies in Mexico. At Davidow 's swearing in, most of the congressmen present were from the Southwest. Congress adds a new and vastly complicating factor to the bureaucratic politics phenomenon regarding Mexico. Not only is there often rivalry and bureaucratic politics between cabinet departments, but there are other rivalries within departments -- for instance, between the Army and Navy within Defense, between Customs and INS within Treasury, between FBI and DEA within Justice. To say these agencies are not always on the same wavelength would be an understatement. Although the ambassador is the titular chief of mission, with all agencies ostensibly reporting to Washington through him, our research revealed that each U.S. agency operating in Mexico conducts a quasiautonomous policy, which it may or may not coordinate with the ambassador. Most agency representatives report directly to their own Washington departments virtually on a daily basis without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mission( DCM). Of course, this will vary depending on the strength, skill, and orientation of particular ambassadors and other personnel. The ever-present problems of bureaucratic rivalry, lack of coordination, and agency secrecy and back-channeling were exacerbated in Mexico during the period when we carried out our research by the absence of an ambassador -- the strong hand at the helm -- for an extended period. Paradoxically, we also found a disconnection between the Washington agencies involved and their representatives " in the field " -- Mexico. It became clear that some Mexico desk officers in Washington, as well as their larger international departments, had no idea what their own agency representatives were doing in Mexico or what specific policies they were carrying out. It is obviously difficult to coordinate policy when Washington officials do n't know what their own agency officials are doing in Mexico City. This is due partly to lack of coordination, partly to Washington 's inability oftentimes to control fully its own representatives in the field, and partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear direction out of their own departments. Clearly, some agencies do not trust others with information and do not inform them of major policy initiatives. The most striking case, analyzed in detail below, involved the Justice Department 's sting operation in Mexico, Operation Casablanca, which nabbed members of Mexico 's banking community on charges of laundering drug money. Justice carried out this operation without informing the White House drug czar 's office or the State Department -- because they feared that State and the drug czar might object and scuttle the operation. From this episode it became clear that the United States has two drug policies in Mexico : one run by Justice and DEA and one run by State and the White House. Neither the right hand nor the left knows fully what the other is doing. Actually, our research shows we have not just two but multiple, often unconnected, sometimes rival drug policies toward Mexico. Because Mexico is so important, many of the big issues in U.S.-Mexican relations are immediately bumped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels. But that is the level at which the least Mexico expertise is brought to bear and at which Mexico issues, rather than being resolved quietly, become the most politicized and controversial, and therefore become virtually incapable of resolution. At this level, also, attention spans may vary, other more immediate issues may suddenly take precedence, or the sentiment may develop that we 've already done enough( with NAFTA) for Mexico. A high priority has been placed on interagency cooperation in implementing policy regarding Mexico. That is why so many issues regarding Mexico get bumped up to cabinet level( at lower levels there would otherwise be very little cooperation, let alone resolution of interagency disputes), why there is a drug czar in the White House( so he can coordinate among cabinet secretaries), and why there are so many interagency task forces on Mexico. However, there is often less cooperation than meets the eye ; the sharing of equipment and resources has not worked out very well, and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating in Mexico. U.S.-Mexico relations are so sensitive in many areas that U.S. representatives must sometimes deny that they exist. For example, the Department of Defense has as least forty-seven cooperative programs with the Mexican military. Yet because of Mexican nationalistic sensitivities on one side and congressional concerns over human rights on the other -- and because DOD has been " burned " numerous times previously on some of these programs -- DOD insists publicly that it has " no programs " in Mexico. More on this deception below. The Mexico case is complicated by the fact that U.S. states, counties, localities, regional entities, and border areas are all conducting their own foreign policies in Mexico with their Mexican counterparts without necessarily involving the State Department or the federal government. The U.S. Constitution and numerous Supreme Court decisions give the federal government a monopoly on foreign policymaking, yet this is violated so often that a whole body of literature has sprung up on what is called " local foreign policy. " These are not just innocent " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as water, immigration, drugs, and border patrol. There are so many U.S. programs operating in Mexico that it is impossible to keep track of them all. Even ambassadors and DCMs are sometimes unaware of all the programs being run through their embassies. In addition, quite a number of these programs are hidden from view, even from embassy officials, for fear of public disclosure and resulting embarrassment -- either to Mexico or to the United States. We are used to seeing, let us say, USAID operating perhaps five or six major programs in a specific country, a number that is usually manageable in terms of embassy and policy administration. But every U.S. agency surveyed seems to be running scores of programs in Mexico. And with approximately thirty agencies listed officially on the embassy roster, this adds up to approximately one thousand programs operating in Mexico. That figure does not include the programs of the many agencies operating in Mexico that are not listed on the embassy roster, nor does it include the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entities who carry out their own programs in Mexico quite independent of the embassy. When these programs are added in, the figure rises to several thousand( not including the private sector -- see below). No one person could be aware, let alone fully apprised of so many programs. Administrators produce a bureaucratic nightmare when they fail to coordinate, work at cross purposes, drop the ball, and contradict each other. Not only are there bureaucratic politics operating within the U.S. embassy in Mexico City and among agencies in Washington, but the border area itself presents a whole separate arena, complicating U.S.-Mexico policy in a new way. The two thousand-mile border contains gaping holes through which, despite a massive U.S. effort, tons of cocaine and marijuana and thousands of illegal immigrants continue to slip. Part of the problem is again bureaucratic : at least ten primary federal agencies, plus numerous state, county, local, and regional agencies, operate in the border area. These agencies render themselves ineffective because of lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and duplicated assignments, and bureaucratic rivalries. New steps are being taken to harmonize border activities through a Southwest border coordinator. Probably these are steps in the right direction, but it seems unlikely they will solve the problems. Because Mexico is a large country and shares a long border with the United States, we conduct more private activities and transactions vis-a-vis Mexico than we do with any other country in the world, except Canada. Involving parties as diverse as the Ford Foundation, human rights groups, soldiers of fortune, tourists, investors, maquiladores, drug runners, and coyotes carrying immigrants into the United States, these private transactions -- accelerated by NAFTA -- have reached a stupendous volume. Although many involve major policy issues, few of these activities are ever coordinated with official U.S. government policy, and some may even be at odds with it. The result is an incredible, uncoordinated cacophony of uncontrollable voices and activities in U.S.-Mexico relations. <p> Virtually every U.S. government agency operating in Mexico is pursuing its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are often secret, contradictory, and conducted with varying levels of coordination with the ambassador. Although this means that each agency has a piece of the action and a vested interest in its own programs, the agencies lose overall coordination, harmony, and focus on the larger goals. The lack of coordination, including the downright secrecy in which some programs are shrouded -- as evidenced by the infamous Justice Department sting operation -- have damaged both U.S. interests and U.S.-Mexican relations. The United States does not have one single, well-thought-out policy that it arrived at through the rational actor model. Rather, it has scores of policies toward Mexcio. Ultimately, having so many policies means having no policy at all, and that is both dysfunctional and self-defeating. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AS FINDINGS <p> Normally in an article of this kind, any mention of research methodology is confined to a dreary appendix. But in this case the methodology itself merits mention, since it turned up a variety of interesting findings about the bureaucratic politics of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan was to inventory all the U.S. government agencies operating in Mexico and request information on their Mexico programs. Our list of U.S. government agencies operating in Mexico was derived from three sources : the Federal Staff Directory, the State Department 's Key Officers of Foreign Service Posts( June 1997), and a list provided by the State Department of agencies accredited to the U.S. embassy in Mexico City, entitled " Agencies for FY98. "( n8) <p> Obviously for a research project like this we employed a variety of sources : in-depth research, library and archival materials, interviews, and when possible, participant observation. But to see what information was available in the public domain, we determined to begin our research by having research assistants contact the U.S. agencies involved and request a statement of each agency 's policies and programs in Mexico. The research assistants were told to describe the research project, to be as open as possible, and to ask politely for whatever public information on Mexico policy was available. The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of these responses, a selection of which are included here, tell us a lot about U.S. policy, or the lack thereof, in Mexico : <p> Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. We were told by the Washington office that ATF policy in Mexico would be " the same as anywhere else, " " like Florida. " However, " to be 100 percent sure " of this, we would need to submit a formal written request according to the guidelines of the Freedom of Information Act. When we called Mexico City, we received a much more cooperative response from ATF officials there. They said it was " no big secret " : ATF 's role is " to assist the Mexican government in tracing all U.S.-source firearms seized in Mexico. " <p> Department of Agriculture. General information about the department was available on the department 's Web page. However, even though it has numerous programs in Mexico, Agriculture headquarters in Washington, including the international office, did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agricultural Affairs office at the U.S. embassy in Mexico. But that office would not give out any information about its programs( presumably because they touch on the hot drug issue) without an official request letter sent to the office director in Mexico City. Center for Strategic and International Studies( CSIS) faxed such a letter on 29 June 1998, but has yet to receive a response. <p> Department of Commerce. The Department of Commerce was generally unhelpful but did send a packet of materials. The materials contained no information specifically on Mexico, though they did provide Web site addresses that offered public relations descriptions of investment opportunities in Mexico. <p> Department of Defense. DOD is extremely sensitive these days after a number of recent, well-publicized gaffes and exposures, including revelations of Mexican drug czar General Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo 's associations with " The Lord of the Skies, " drug cartel leader Amado Carrillo ; controversial sting operations directed at Mexican banks ; revelations of possibly illegal U.S. training of Mexican troops in counternarcotics and counterinsurgency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the military attache 's office. DOD at first told us that there were " no programs " and " no military operations " in Mexico. Probing deeper, since we knew that was false, we were told that there were " several programs " that were " tailored to what each country can live with. " With regard to the Personnel Exchange Program, we were informed that U.S. military branches send their officers to Mexico to provide information on U.S. culture to Mexican officers.( Culture?) In the United States, on the other hand, Mexican military personnel are employed as language instructors in military academies.( Language instructors?) <p> Better and more forthright answers came from the office of International Security Affairs at DOD. We were told that most of the work DOD is doing in Mexico deals with counternarcotics. The United States, we were informed, provides helicopters and other equipment, as well as training in counternarcotics. A special office of Drug Enforcement Policy and Support has been established within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drug Enforcement Agency. We were informed that the only information available to the public is on DEA 's Web site. That information is very general and nonspecific. In addition, we were advised to consult the National Narcotic Intelligence Consumer Committee annual report, as well as congressional testimony, both of which proved to be quite uninformative. <p> Department of State. The packet we received from the State Department failed to provide the information we requested on Mexico or State 's programs there. On State 's Web site, we found a useful description of priorities for the U.S. embassy in Mexico. The Mexico office at State was helpful in providing the list of agencies that are part of the U.S. embassy in Mexico. Because of its proximity, and because Mexico is a( maybe the) primary producer and transshipment point for drugs entering the United States, Mexico has become the primary focus for every government agency involved in counternarcotics. <p> Department of the Treasury. The Treasury Department, Bureau of Customs, said it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was necessary to call the U.S. embassy in Mexico. The Customs official at the embassy told us he could not give out any information without " making a few calls. " Ultimately we were directed back to the Policy Division of the International Affairs Office of U.S. Customs in Washington. <p> Federal Bureau of Investigation. We spoke with several offices at the FBI. We were repeatedly transferred( from the Mexico desk to public affairs to research to the press office) because no one was sure what information they were allowed to disclose. Finally the press office instructed us to fax a request letter, which we did on August 7 ; we have yet to receive a reply. <p> Internal Revenue Service. We were told that the information we were requesting on IRS activities in Mexico is " not that basic. " Nevertheless( or is it because of that fact?), we would need to file a formal request under the Freedom of Information Act and guarantee payment of all research and search expenses. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available on the Web page, we were told, and is " applicable to all countries. " Specific information on Mexico can be found in the country report. That report proved to be both forthcoming and informative. <p> Obviously, this brief survey represents only one attempt -- and a quite superficial one at that -- at coming to grips with U.S. policy toward Mexico. Clearly, we have employed other sources of information and other methodologies. Furthermore, some of the responses cited can be ascribed to incompetent, unresponsive, bureaucratic( not entirely unheard-of in Washington, D.C.), or ill-informed public affairs officials who do n't know and do n't care what U.S. policy is in Mexico or who are uninterested in being helpful to the public. Nevertheless, even at this superficial level, these responses tend to support the conclusions reached in the first section of the paper about( a) the huge number of agencies and programs involved in Mexico,( b) the lack of coordination between and within the agencies, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of these programs are shrouded, and( d) the effort to shield or disguise what American policy is doing in Mexico. PROGRAMS ASSESSED <p> It is impossible, in a brief article like this, to assess all the complex, often overlapping U.S. policies toward Mexico. Much of the preliminary information, in terms of formal, official statements of U.S. policy, is contained in the appendix. In the next section, therefore, we focus on two policy arenas, U.S. drug policy and military cooperation, because they more or less represent the major U.S. policy priorities in Mexico and because they illustrate many of the general points made earlier. Because of space considerations, we focus mainly on aspects related to the main theme of bureaucratic politics. Drug Policy <p> There are, at last count, no less than forty-three U.S. government agencies involved in counternarcotics. Because of its proximity, and because Mexico is a( maybe the) primary producer and transshipment point for drugs entering the United States, Mexico has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Heroic efforts have been made, particularly by the Office of the Drug Czar, to coordinate these agencies and present a single, clear, coherent policy and strategy. The creation of the drug czar 's office during the Reagan administration was itself an admission that the then-existing drug policy needed better coordination. Then, as now, State, Defense, DEA, Customs, Coast Guard, and others were all independently carrying out their own counternarcotics policies, meanwhile entangling in bureaucratic rivalries, jealousies, turf battles, and fights over budgets and responsibilities. The drug czar 's office was therefore located in the White House to give it added clout, and the drug czar was supposed to be a cabinet member. The elevated status would enable him to meet and negotiate with other cabinet secretaries as an equal, knock heads if necessary, and arrive at a coordinated policy. The key question has always been whether the drug czar would be a member of the cabinet or not, and administrations have changed direction several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barry McCaffrey, is not a member of the cabinet. Therefore, there are severe limits on his ability to coordinate drug policy among the several departments. The law enforcement agencies see State as " soft " on drugs and have even threatened to bring obstruction of justice charges against U.S. officials who refuse to go along with some... schemes. <p> A variety of coordinating groups, interagency task forces, undersecretaries, assistant secretaries, and subprincipals ' groups operate below the drug czar. Quite a number of these serve useful functions, particularly by sharing information. But below the top cabinet level, almost no decision can be made -- unless the principals also concur, which happens irregularly. Many of the meetings of these groups are not necessarily full information-sharing meetings ; rather, one agency hosts a briefing that may or may not provide full information. The other agencies may listen and take notes, but they will not necessarily share their own full information or report fully on the policy initiatives of their agencies. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the policies of their own agencies. Nor can lower-level officials be expected to reach agreement, let alone have the authority to coordinate policy, since their principals may not be in agreement, fully informed on new initiatives, or yet " on board. " Hence at all levels, but particularly at the very top, there is neither full coordination of U.S. drug policy nor the incentives or authority to achieve it.( n9) <p> The basic split in policy is between those agencies that have primarily law enforcement backgrounds, orientations, and responsibilities( Justice, Treasury, DEA, FBI, Customs) and those that are primarily political and diplomatic( CIA, State, White House, including the Office of the Drug Czar). My earlier research( n10) revealed that these law enforcement agencies( Justice, DEA, and FBI) are mainly staffed at policy levels -- not surprisingly -- by lawyers. All of these agencies are relatively new to the foreign affairs arena ; they tend to have few personnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, to be dominated by ethnocentrism, and often to have a tunnel vision concerning policy. That is, as law enforcement agencies, legitimately and quite properly charged with the responsibility of implementing and enforcing the law( U.S. law -- and there is one of the nubs of the problem), their job is to carry out U.S. counternarcotics policy. If carrying out this responsibility means harassing, arresting, or ousting military officers, cabinet members, or even the president of another country( as in the case of Colombia 's Ernesto Samper), then so be it. If it means kidnaping Mexicans from their own nation and bringing them to the United States for trial, then so be it. If it means violating Mexican law by carrying guns while operating in Mexican national territory, then that must be done too. If it means conducting a sting operation among bankers in Mexico( also illegal under Mexican law) and luring them to the United States for arrest, then that too must be approved. There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies whose single-track vision and legitimate responsibilities oblige them to enforce the law -- even if that implies enormous costs in terms of overall U.S.-Mexican relations and even if that is often self-defeating on its own law enforcement terms. <p> The second set of agencies mentioned above has a different set of priorities and responsibilities. State, CIA( at least its analytic arm), and the White House -- including, although the orientation is not 100 percent, the drug czar 's office -- tend to emphasize the larger picture of U.S.-Mexican relations. They tend to see the law enforcement types as cowboys who may well damage U.S.-Mexican relations by their one-track policies and overzealous implementation of them. They do not believe that arresting high-level Mexican officials or drumming high-ranking military officers out of the armed forces is the correct policy. Kidnaping Mexican officials from their own territory, riding roughshod over Mexican laws, and de facto taking over some Mexican government functions is not, they believe, in the long-term best interests of either Mexico or the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a number of these officials are opposed to much of the U.S. counternarcotics strategy, since they believe that drug sales are a crucial element in the Mexican national economy and that successfully removing that component might well destabilize Mexico. Many are not convinced that a " war on drugs " is the right course to pursue or that the drug problem can be solved by focusing on the supply or production side. These agencies, in other words, are concerned with the big picture of U.S.-Mexican relations, which takes place on multiple, complex, interdependent levels and which may well be harmed by a too zealous, unilateral, single-agency enforcement of the U.S. drug policy. In response, the law enforcement agencies see State as " soft " on drugs and have even threatened to bring obstruction of justice charges against U.S. officials who refuse to go along with some of Justice 's more harebrained schemes. When one agency of the U.S. government threatens the officials of another( including a U.S. ambassador, although in another country besides Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry out what the first agency wants to do, that is more than bureaucratic politics run amok ; that is complete chaos and dysfunction. In other words, we have no single counternarcotics policy towards Mexico, but two( and many more) conflicting policies, run by conflicting agencies, whose constant feuding and competition threaten to destroy U.S.-Mexican relations. <p> The case that best illustrates these destructive bureaucratic conflicts is the sting operation known as " Casablanca, " carried out by the Justice and Treasury Departments against a number of Mexican bank officials in an effort to catch them on a money laundering charge. Over a three year period, U.S. undercover agents apparently lured bankers working mainly with Mexico 's Juarez narcotraffickers to launder drug money, using such techniques as wire transfers and bankers ' drafts. For their service, the bankers received 2 to 3 percent of the transactions. The culmination of the sting came when American officials lured the bankers to the United States with the promise of a free holiday in San Diego and Las @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico was often viewed by U.S. policymakers as a difficult, prickly, noncooperative country on such issues as Mexico 's failure to break relations with communist Cuba or to adhere to the U.S. blockade. This case is particularly interesting for a number of reasons. First, Mexican law does not allow sting operations, so U.S. officials were using U.S. laws to indict Mexican bank officials operating in Mexican national territory. Second, for the reason just cited as well as Mexican nationalism -- specifically the sense that Mexican officials were cowed by the United States -- the sting elicited a howl of protest in Mexico, which not only formally objected but threatened to prosecute the U.S. officials who ran the antidrug sting. Third, although we are supposed to be cooperating with Mexico at all levels in the drug war, the sting was carried out without informing Mexican high government authorities or gaining their legal approval for the U.S. actions-apparently because of American impatience with the failure of Mexican prosecutors to make any real progress against drug corruption and for fear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sting. Fourth, and most important for our discussion of bureaucratic politics, the Justice-Treasury sting was carried out without informing either the Department of State or the Office of the Drug Czar, or informing them at such low levels and in such a purposely obscurant way that no one would recognize the larger policy implications of the sting. The reason for not fully informing the latter two agencies was Justice 's and Treasury 's fears that State and the drug czar, with their " softer " attitudes on drugs and focus on " the big picture, " would object, leak the information, or scuttle the operation by appealing to President Clinton. Needless to say, State and the drug czar 's office were very angry over being left out of the loop on Casablanca. <p> In an editorial, the New York Times denounced the sting as both unlawful and undiplomatic.( n12) It said that Washington 's failure to obtain Mexico 's approval for an undercover operation carried out on Mexican soil was inexcusable and had turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton was obliged to express " regrets " to Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo after a wave of denunciation and threats from Mexico. But elsewhere in the United States, denunciations were rather muted, reflecting American impatience with apparent Mexican foot-dragging on the issue and the tendency( or preference) of Americans to blame Mexico for our own drug problems. The public undoubtedly supported the sting, and DEA was quick to claim credit for the operation regardless of State 's views. <p> A far more informed and biting criticism came from CSIS 's Mexico Project director Delal Baer,( n13) who at the time of the sting was living and conducting in-depth research in Mexico. She was thus able to assess the impact of the sting as well as of overall U.S. drug policy in Mexico at a level far deeper than U.S. editorialists. Baer criticized a policy in which law enforcement agencies( Customs at Treasury and DEA at Justice) are in the pilot 's seat and allowed to operate autonomously from other U.S. agencies and from overall U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. government, untrained in foreign policy, have little understanding of the larger consequences of their tactics. Not only was the sting a diplomatic embarrassment for the United States, but its consequences reverberated negatively through the whole Mexican political system and the entire U.S.-Mexico bilateral relationship, of which Customs and DEA are often blissfully unaware. For example, the timing of the sting threw a monkey wrench into delicate negotiations President Zedillo was conducting with the Mexican Congress over financial reforms -- reforms which are in the U.S. interest to see enacted. The sting also panicked investors -- whom U.S. policy has an interest in encouraging -- who interpreted the operation as indicating the U.S. government lacked confidence in Mexican institutions. The sting and the intense Mexican reaction to it also led to several calls in Mexico for the resignation of their central bank governor and attorney general -- officials whom the U.S. has tried discreetly to support.( n14) <p> Baer goes on to say that while it may not be the responsibility of U.S. law enforcement officials to monitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico, it is the responsibility of senior officials to coordinate policy among the various agencies involved. They should ensure that such operations are conducted with at least some respect for signed agreements and rules of bilateral cooperation between the two countries, as well as with a sense of the impact of such policies in Mexico and their effect on overall U.S.-Mexican relations. Apparently that was not done in this case -- and indeed this case is part of a pattern in overall US. -Mexican relations. The stage is thus set for a new and recurring confrontation between the United States and Mexico. For instance, Justice and Treasury can be expected to pressure hard for decertifying Mexico as a country cooperating in the drug war, while State and, one hopes, the White House will be scrambling to present the larger picture of U.S.-Mexico interrelations to prevent Congress from making that blunder. Baer concludes sarcastically : What a " victory " for Janet Reno, Customs, and DEA! They have proven that if the United States dangles $30 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can corrupt them in the same way drug traffickers already have. For this dubious revelation we have put the entire framework of U.S.-Mexican relations at risk. <p> Unfortunately, this case is not atypical of a wide range of U.S. policies -- on drugs and a host of other issues -- in Mexico that emerge as the result of the bureaucratic politics of American policymaking. Reviewing only my own files on Mexico from the last few month reveals such headlines as " The U.S. at Odds With Itself on Mexico, " " Drug War Leader Is Frustrated : Kramek Says Politics Hamper Coast Guard, "( n15) and " 2000 Miles of Disarray in Drug War : U.S.-Mexico Border Effort a Shambles. "( n16) Meanwhile, through the Southwest Border Initiative, the Justice Department continues to operate in Mexico with the same coalition of law enforcement agencies( Customs, DEA, FBI, the Criminal Division of Justice, the U.S. Attorneys ' Offices, the High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Program, and state and local counterparts) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither State, CIA, the drug czar, or the NSC is represented. Finally, we have the devastating reports of the General Accounting Office -- about as objective a voice as we are going to get on this issue -- whose consistent conclusion through a series of reports has been :( a) " Mexico continues to be the principal transit country for cocaine entering the United States " ;( b) " despite U.S. and Mexican counternarcotics efforts, the flow of illegal drugs into the United States has not significantly diminished " ; and( c) the effectiveness and usefulness of new laws, new counternarcotics agencies, and new initiatives is limited " due to inadequate planning and coordination among U.S. agencies " emphasis added.( n18) Military Cooperation <p> Over the decades, U.S. military cooperation with Mexico has been exceedingly sensitive and therefore quite limited. While the United States is eager to engage its Mexican counterparts in joint, cooperative activities, the Mexican side has been very reluctant. This stems from a variety of factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the United States defeated Mexico and took 40 percent of her national territory ; constitutional prohibitions against training military units in foreign countries ; Mexico 's extreme sensitivity to U.S. slights and/or intervention in Mexico 's internal affairs( e.g., Operation Casablanca) ; powerful anti-Americanism in the Mexican foreign service, at universities, and among leftist groups ; a strong sense of inferiority on the part of Mexican military officials about their professionalism compared to that of U.S. officials ; a Mexican foreign policy that was historically oriented toward frustrating or opposing the United States on all issues ; a tradition stemming from the Mexican Revolution of 1910 that leads Mexico to be sympathetic to revolutions( Cuba, Nicaragua) and revolutionary movements( the FMLN of El Salvador, for example) that the United States opposes ; and resentment and jealousy that the United States is a First World country while Mexico remains in the Third World. Doubtless other more immediate factors( corruption, far lower salaries for the Mexican military than for their U.S. counterparts) are involved, along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So long as Mexico was peaceful and stable, and the cold war was still on but centered elsewhere, the United States was not preoccupied with these Mexican sensitivities or the lack of contact with the Mexican military. Mexico was often viewed by U.S. policymakers as a difficult, prickly, noncooperative country -- a pain in the neck -- on such issues as Mexico 's failure( alone among countries of the hemisphere) to break relations with communist Cuba or to adhere to the U.S. blockade ; her failure to support the 1965 U.S. intervention in the Dominican Republic ; her obstreperous and often anti-American support of guerrilla forces in Central America in the 1980s ; and her consistent refusal to support the creation of a U.S.-favored inter-American defense force( seen as " imperialist, " " antirevolutionary, " and a fig leaf for U.S. unilateral intervention) or the expansion of responsibilities of the Inter-American Defense Board -- for fear the United States would dominate it as well. <p> But then a number of things happened to force a considerable reappraisal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mexican side. First, in the 1980s and 1990s Mexico began to look far more shaky both economically and politically ; the United States( and perhaps Mexico too, though reluctantly) realized it could no longer take Mexican stability for granted. Second, the growing realization of their complex interdependence on so many issues led the two countries closer together. Third, there was NAFTA, which the United States initially saw more as a security strategy to help stabilize Mexico than an economic trade agreement. NAFTA made Mexico a " North American country "( which the Mexicans as well as the rest of Latin America are still trying to get used to), established the United States the guarantor in perpetuity of Mexican economic and political stability, and brought the two countries closer together on a variety of issues. Fourth, the end of the cold war not only led the United States to pay greater attention to what military strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan a hundred years ago called its " soft, vulnerable underbelly, " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Third World game " of balancing off the United States against the Soviet Union ; the United States was now " the only game in town. " Fifth, the growing traffic in narcotics led Mexico, belatedly, to the conclusion that drugs were not just an American consumption problem, but they could also, as in Colombia, damage Mexican institutions and society as well. From the mid-1980s on, the role of the Mexican military in the counternarcotics effort increased exponentially. Sixth, the uprising in Chiapas and guerrilla activity elsewhere in Mexico revealed how poorly equipped Mexico 's military was to conduct counterinsurgency warfare against a foe that was dedicated, organized, and skillful( e.g, able to use the media and the Internet to mobilize domestic and international support). All of these factors, and doubtless others besides, began to push the United States and Mexico not into a military-to-military embrace but into a slowly evolving, closer yet still prickly relationship, marked by numerous sensitivities and many ups and downs. <p> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States moved slowly in creating confidence-building and cooperative programs over the course of the last three decades.( n20) They took very low-level cooperative steps : welcoming a Mexican military officer at the prestigious U.S. National War College ; accepting a U.S. officer at the Mexican national military academy ; upgrading the U.S. military attache in Mexico City to brigadier general status ; conducting a low-key and low-visibility annual exchange of a small number of officers at the service academies, in foreign language instruction programs, and so forth. Meanwhile, other, potentially larger and more encompassing programs, such as the World War II-created Joint Mexican-United States Defense Commission( JMUSDC), either languished or, as in the case of military assistance programs, remained limited, or in terms of joint exercises were virtually nonexistent. But Mexico has made it plain it does not want to see JMUSDC 's mandate broadened and was particularly opposed to its assuming an operational role. And the hardware or military assistance approach relies entirely on Mexico 's deciding to make a major purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Mexico buys significant amounts of equipment from France, Russia, and other sources and thereby purposely limits U.S. influence ; at the same time on the American side, Congress or the State Department may block the sale -- particularly when facing the scrutiny of human rights groups after the 1994 Chiapas uprising. <p> In 1988 the Defense Department adopted a new program for closer bilateral military relations with Mexico.( n21) This program, which predates the end of the cold war as well as the emergence in the 1990s of an entirely new gamut of intermestic issues, still appears to be guiding U.S. policy, although it has been updated. The program directed the armed forces to forge greater military-to-military relationships with their Mexican counterparts through two open-ended stages. The first involved efforts, through exchange and other programs, to provide Mexico with a better understanding of the U.S. armed forces. The second stage involved increased contact, but now on a reciprocal basis. Given the Mexican sensitivities listed above, the program required patience, flexibility, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire for high-level talks or joint exercises ; U.S. military officials recognized that by law Mexican armed forces were forbidden from participating in any combined or coordinated exercises with any other country and that military units could not leave Mexico to train in the United States. For the Department of Defense, this kind of high-sensitivity relationship was relatively new and unique, but not universally accepted within DOD. It was a remarkably enlightened program, designed by Defense intellectuals who actually knew something about Mexico and were able to see their ideas translated into policy terms. <p> During the course of the early 1990s, these kinds of low-level, low-key contacts gradually increased. Most of them emphasized interservice contacts, primarily involving the Coast Guard and the Navy 's Third Fleet, which is headquartered in San Diego. These included U.S. port visits in Mexico, cooperative search and rescue operations at sea, " coincidental interaction "( passing information and sharing experiences), counterdrug cooperation at sea, antismuggling operations, environmental protection efforts, establishment of a permanent " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of visiting military or military war college delegations, and so on. This " slow and steady " approach was eventually expanded to include some unprecedented joint training missions in Mexico, like airborne exercises in which U.S. aircraft served as jump platforms for Mexican paratroopers. The DOD strategy clearly was to use these low-level contacts and interchanges both to build confidence with the often hypersensitive Mexicans and to pave the way for bigger and higher-level cooperation in such potentially controversial areas as counterinsurgency and war on drugs. By the mid-1990s, the Department of Defense was proudly( but still quietly) saying that it had over forty-five cooperative programs with the Mexican armed forces. <p> But then things began to get out of hand, to go beyond the pale. Part of this had to do with the military 's political culture -- Allison 's organizational model. DOD has many able, energetic, ambitious, gung-ho officers -- Type-A personalities eager to overcome all obstacles and " get the job done " -- who, once they receive their orders, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would suggest. But part of it also had to do with purposeful secrecy aimed at deceiving or going around Congress, as well as circumventing other agencies -- the bureaucratic politics phenomenon. Our focus here is mainly on the latter. <p> To begin with, the context changed. First, U.S. military assistance and sales to Mexico increased dramatically. A country that had long been purposely low-profile from both the U.S. and Mexican perspectives now vaulted quickly to the midrange of U.S. military assistance.( n22) Second, the stakes dramatically increased : Mexico became the primary transshipment point for drugs entering the United States ; guerrilla uprisings, economic collapse, violence and assassinations, and rising crime threatened social upheaval and political instability ; and high-level U.S. officials became increasingly concerned for the fate of its large neighbor to the south. Third, in contrast to the low-key, low-visibility policy of the past, Mexico became high profile and high visibility with the visit of Defense Secretary William Perry in 1996, followed by a parade of other cabinet-level visits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure from the Congress, the public, and the press, abandoned its earlier cautious, deferential, patient, and nonthreatening approach and began a more blatant, high-pressure, even interventionist policy. Instead of allowing Mexico to conduct its own reform program at its own pace, the United States began increasingly to take the lead, increase the pressure, and treat Mexico as " just another banana republic " -- albeit an especially large and proximate one. <p> A few specific examples( among many) of the bureaucratic politics of this new relationship will suffice to make the point. First is the celebrated case of General Gutierrez Rebollo, Mexico 's drug czar. That special position had been created in Mexico at U.S. urging and with considerable U.S. pressure. General Gutierrez had been appointed to the post to emphasize that Mexico was serious about counternarcotics, that this was a war on drugs, and to make the position comparable to that of General Barry McCaffrey, the U.S. drug czar. McCaffrey had confidence in General Gutierrez and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What McCaffrey was not aware of was that General Gutierrez was in the service of one of the Mexican drug lords. More than that, this information about General Gutierrez 's drug connections was available to U.S. intelligence, specifically the Defense Intelligence Agency. But in another instance of the right hand not knowing what the left was doing, it was never shared with McCaffrey and the drug czar 's office. <p> Another example is the Joint Combined Exchange Training( JCET) program.( n23) The JCET program is funded under a 1991 law that says U.S. troops may go on joint, combined training exercises with foreign militaries overseas if the primary purpose is to train U.S. troops. Oversight of the program is the responsibility of the secretary of defense, specifically the assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict, and ultimately the Congress, which passed the measure. But over the years JCET was vastly expanded to encompass activities not intended or anticipated in the original legislation. Under JCET, U.S. forces have trained former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colombian armed forces in counterinsurgency and counternarcotics policy, done the same in Peru and other countries, and in general used the program to evade the restrictions governing other assistance programs that involve aid to militaries that abuse human rights. Virtually no oversight of this mushrooming program was carried out by DOD or Congress, and the State Department was seldom informed about the full extent of the training. Some of these agencies preferred not to know too much.( n24) <p> In Mexico the JCET program has been used to train Mexican troops on Mexican soil. This is a dangerous step because of extreme Mexican sensitivities, for historical and nationalistic reasons, concerning the presence of any foreign troops on Mexican soil -- especially American troops training Mexicans in exceedingly touchy counternarcotics and counterinsurgency issues. These issues are especially sensitive because, unlike most Americans, Mexicans are not convinced that drug trafficking for the U.S. market and the presence of Zapatista guerrillas in Chiapas are such unmitigated evils. In addition to the training on Mexican soil, U.S. Army Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican troops who form elite counter-narcotics and counterinsurgency battalions. Because Mexico 's constitution forbids training Mexican units in foreign countries, the members of these battalions are flown to the United States in small groups, trained, and then flown back to Mexico, where these smaller units are reassembled.( n25) But Mexico 's constitution is a hallowed and revered one, and this transparent subterfuge by the Americans to avoid its prohibitions can only be described as stupid and self-defeating. Apparently the U.S. government is under such intense pressure to solve the drug issue that it is willing to violate the Mexican constitution -- one of the main institutional pillars still holding Mexico together -- to achieve that goal. Moreover, once the JCET training is complete, the United States can not control how Mexico uses these troops. In fact, in both Colombia and Mexico these U.S.-trained elite units have been employed less in counternarcotics( the U.S. priority) than in counterinsurgency( the Colombian and Mexican priority), where they have committed widespread human rights abuses. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups and within the U.S. Congress which, exempting itself, of course, blames DOD and State for not overseeing these programs more closely. <p> These and other issues have led to storms of protest in Mexico. In summer 1998 Mexico issued increasingly sharp attacks over what it views as " unacceptable interventionist attitudes on the part of the United States. " It was incensed over Operation Casablanca and demanded that those U.S. officials responsible for the sting be brought to Mexico to stand trial for violating Mexican laws. Most Mexicans are convinced( and Comandante Marcos has charged) that U.S. special forces are working with Mexican armed forces in Chiapas to wipe out the Zapatista guerillas. Mexican sentiments were further inflamed when two out-of-uniform U.S. military officials from the military attache 's office in Mexico City appeared at the site of recent violence in Chiapas ; after being detained by local villagers, they lamely said that they were there only " to learn the countryside and the culture. " These repeated and often illegal interventions in Mexican internal affairs have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only of JMET but of a wide range of cooperative U.S.-Mexico programs built up over the years. At the time of writing, the relations between the United States and Mexico were extremely tense on a wide range of important issues. <p> I have treated these two programs, drug policy and military cooperation, separately, but in fact they are intimately interrelated. One need not be an advocate of " militarizing the drug war " to recognize that some degree of involvement and cooperation from both the U.S. and Mexican militaries is necessary to solve the drug problem. At the same time, reforming the Mexican military is essential if overall policy toward Mexico, including democratization and a better human rights performance, is to succeed. However the bureaucratic politics practiced by different agencies in each of these areas has a multiplier effect when applied to U.S. policy as a whole based on democracy, stability, open markets, and free trade. Multiple agencies ' practicing bureaucratic politics in numerous policy arenas compounds the aforementioned problems of chaos, dysfunction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to also focus on other U.S. policies toward Mexico, including energy policy, immigration policy, environmental policy, and border policy, we would find many of the same problems of bureaucratic conflict, turf wars, battles for bureaucratic prestige and budgets, ignorance about what other agencies are doing, and the like. The result is not just a confused U.S. policy with the main policy goals often lost in the bureaucratic maneuvering and manipulation, but the possibility of a breakdown in policy, defined as the inability to accomplish major policy goals in Mexico. When U.S. policy ineptness, overreaching, conflict, and sometimes too-heavy-handedness are added to the possibilities for fragmentation and ungovernability in Mexico itself, they become truly frightening indeed. CONCLUSION <p> The United States can not continue to run its foreign policy on this basis. With the end of the cold war, it is domestic politics and bureaucratic rivalries that almost exclusively drive U.S. foreign policy, rather than a hardheaded but enlightened calculation of the national interest and a sense of how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large, important neighbor like Mexico. Congress and the White House play politics with foreign policymaking, doling out whole programs to different agencies on political and bureaucratic grounds. Then each agency conducts its own foreign policy with little or no attachment to a central core of principles and interests. And there is precious little coordination between, among, or even within the distinct agencies involved. Both the politicians and the agencies involved seek to curry favor with particular constituencies and pursue their own organizational and bureaucratic self-interests. Operation Casablanca and the JMET programs are the two most blatant examples, but there are many others.( n26) <p> The bureaucratic politics of U.S.-Mexican policymaking has now snowballed way beyond Allison 's original formulation to encompass dozens of offices, departments, and agencies carrying out hundreds if not thousands of programs. The White House, the president, and the National Security Council are supposed to coordinate all these distinct programs, but that is being done ineffectively or so superficially that each agency continues to follow its own route. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington but also the myriad offices in the Mexico City embassy, which has more U.S. agencies represented than any other U.S. embassy in the world. What in the embassy is supposed to be a coordinated " family " of operations has become dysfunctional. It is said that " we have no one policy toward Mexico but sixty-seven policies. " <p> The incredible pluralism, verging on chaos, has by now begun to affect the substance of American policy toward Mexico. There are two things that exercise the Mexicans : one is the specific contents of individual U.S. policies -- not our main subject here ; the other is the sheer confusion in U.S. policy, the lack of clear direction, the fact that the United States speaks with many voices on foreign policy, not one. Other nations in this and other times have lamented these characteristics of American foreign policy, but now, and specifically in the Mexico case, the situation is far worse and going beyond the pale. The sheer proliferation( the world 's largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left hand of U.S. policymaking seldom knows fully what the right hand( actually, fifty or sixty other " hands ") is doing, and increasingly the political and bureaucratic " games " that one part of the American government tries to play on others( as in Casablanca) are now becoming exceedingly destructive and self-defeating. Not only is there rising anger and indignation in Mexico( n27) -- hardly conducive to gaining Mexican cooperation on a host of issues -- but policy effectiveness is also breaking down. This is more than Allison 's famous model run amok ; it is Allis ' n Wonderland. <p>
