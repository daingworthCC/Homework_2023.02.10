4011741 A general elementary music teacher describes the steps involved in becoming a National Board Certified Teacher. <p> When I first heard of National Certification, I was confused by it all. I heard bits and pieces, but not the whole story. The idea was intriguing, though, so I began the process and became a National Board Certified Teacher, joining the ranks of more than thirty-two thousand teachers nationwide who have earned certification since it was first offered in 1994. Certificates in music -- Early and Middle Childhood( ages 3-12) and Early Adolescence through Young Adulthood( ages 11-18+) -- first became available in 2002. In the last two years, more than six hundred music teachers across the country have become certified. But what is the certification process really like? Now that I am on the other side, I will give you my thoughts and advice in case you would like to try it yourself. <p> First, the downside : Becoming nationally certified takes money and time, as does an advanced degree. The $2,300 cost does seem steep, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards( NBPTS), which administers the certification program. In my case, my school system reimbursed a portion of the cost. Do n't be discouraged -- there are monetary resources out there to help with the expenses. <p> Beyond loans and scholarships, each state has its own set of incentives, some giving a one-time bonus, others giving a pay raise. In my own case, both the local system and the state gave a percentage pay raise, and I am not required to take any staff-development courses for ten years. If, after reading this article, you are interested in pursuing National Certification, you should contact your school system for information on financial aid and reward incentives. <p> Time, though, is another matter. When I was working toward National Certification, I went to school early to spend quiet moments at my computer, organizing documents and writing commentaries. I stayed late many days too, revising what I had already written. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule as necessary. But if you have family or other obligations, you will need to plan your time very carefully. For alternatives to becoming a National Board Certified Teacher, see the Alternatives to National Certification sidebar. Portfolio <p> Upon completing your registration, NBPTS will send you what teachers call " the box, " which contains instructions, forms, checklists, and other information needed to complete the portfolio section of the National Board Certification process. You need to save the box to return your completed portfolio for grading. The portfolio itself is divided into four entries, three of which address a specific phase of instruction : planning, delivering instruction, and demonstrating and developing musicianship. These entries require a videotaped lesson for the assessors to view as they read your written commentary about that lesson. The fourth entry, on the other hand, is used to document your accomplishments -- extra duties, peer collaboration, and community outreach -- as they relate to student achievement. <p> The step-by-step instruction book included in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ http : **47;7625;TOOLONG. The first half of the book is devoted to general tips and instructions, such as how to make a quality video and how to choose a topic or a class. Then, about twenty-five to thirty pages are devoted to each entry, with specific instructions. These pages describe the requirements of each entry in detail, from the length and focus of the video segment to the questions required in each section of the written commentary. By reading these pages carefully, I learned the parameters and expectations, and the tasks became less overwhelming. Since each entry assesses a different aspect of teaching, you must answer different questions in each commentary. By reading each set of questions several times, I was able to choose a lesson that would show those answers clearly in the video. <p> Entries 1-3 are classroom based, each one pertaining to a different aspect of teaching. I had to create a video for each entry, showing my teaching personality, my interaction with students, and my lesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in writing the questions that were provided in the instruction book. <p> Entry 1, Planning. This entry focuses on planning and implementing a unit. I needed to provide proof of sequential, age-appropriate instruction with modifications provided to meet the needs of special students. Because Entry 1 is based on a whole teaching unit, my written commentary included a one-page summary of my unit plan. The entry actually required two short video clips, one early in the unit and the other near the end, to show student progress. <p> My written commentary for this entry began with a page of instructional context, informing the assessors of class size, age, and grade. I let them know of any instructional challenges in the class, along with anything else that I thought might be relevant. For example, in one class, three students come straight from a speech class and are always late to music. It can not be helped. I wanted the assessors to know so they would understand why students were coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the class. In another class, I mentioned a boy with physical challenges who had no purposeful motion in his arms. <p> Questions for Entry 1 focused on the differences between video segments, how much progress was made, who had problems in the first segment, and how I worked with those students. For example, I noted that a certain student had problems playing a crossover bordun in the first video segment, but in the second video she had mastered it. Since the videos did not show my process of remediation, I wrote that I had worked one on one with her, moving her hands to the right note as she learned the feel. Another question asked about student improvement. A good unit, taught well, should show achievement. <p> What if the students did not achieve? The final section of the commentary offers teachers a chance to reflect about the lesson. What could I do to make the unit better for future classes? My video segments showed some individual improvement, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was glad to know that I did not have to begin the entry again. I could answer honestly that a lot could be done to improve the unit. I mused that maybe the unit was too difficult for much of the class. I listed several possible improvements, including changing the goal to an easier one or even not using that unit again because of its many problems. <p> NBPTS is not looking for perfect teachers with perfect students in perfect classes. They are looking for teachers who know how to adapt to situations, who can provide for different learning styles, and who want to become better. The process gives teachers a chance to review their teaching practices and plan improvements, or even to pat themselves on the back, if warranted. <p> Entry 2, Delivering Instruction. This entry has one longer video that deals with just one lesson. I read that the assessors would be looking for a well-paced lesson featuring sequential activities that were appropriate to the learners and good transitions between activities. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all times. <p> I chose to use a kindergarten class because of the children 's wholehearted enthusiasm for every activity During my thirty-minute lesson, I reviewed a poem that describes high and low, had the students move their hands up and down to signify high and low, echoed some sirens to get their voices involved, had them slide their voices higher and lower to go with the words of the poem, and then introduced the xylophones. I had stacked books under the high end of the instruments to help the students visually. As I read the poem again, they could walk up the hill, tumble down the hill, swing high, slide low, and so on with their mallets. Every activity was about high/low, culminating in an exploration of xylophones. <p> In my written commentary, I explained why I chose these particular activities. I used them to review up and down before we played the pitched instruments for the first time and to remind them of the poem 's story. In answering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video as I instructed the students. I also referred to several students ' videotaped activities as they immersed themselves in the lesson. One question for Entry 2 asked about learning styles. I mentioned several activities that were shown on the video -- moving arms, moving bodies, speaking, singing, and playing -- that would appeal to different learning styles. <p> Entry 3, Demonstrating and Developing Musicianship. For this entry, I was asked to show my musicianship in a way that would encourage my students ' skills. I chose a fifth-grade class and focused on syncopation. I wrote a poem about syncopation that had both straight rhythms and syncopations. The video showed us reading the poem together and discussing the rhythms. I underlined the syncopations and we clapped them. I let my students know that I wrote the poem and asked them to perform it several ways -- saying it, clapping it, saying the straight section and clapping the syncopations, and so forth. Then I moved to a xylophone and improvised the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, which led to a discussion of the rhythm itself as well as the possibilities of perfection. Then groups of students improvised the rhythm on the xylophones. <p> Questions I answered in this written commentary included, How do your students respond to your modeling? and, How do you assess their musicianship in this entry? My students responded with enthusiasm and carried that over into their playing, as was evident in the video. Each group of players made the poem their own, adding stick clicks at the beginning or whispering the straight section instead of playing it. The whole lesson became uniquely theirs. And they truly understood the difference between straight rhythms and syncopations. <p> Entry 4, Documented Accomplishments : Contributions to Student Learning. This final entry of the portfolio is very different. It does not require a video or any interaction with the students. This entry asked me to consider things I do outside of the classroom that help the students learn. It is divided into three areas : my own continuing education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and community involvement. Many things can be included here -- for example, musical programs, field trips, teaching a song at the request of a classroom teacher, and attending conferences. <p> I wrote about musical performances I had directed and written the music for, and as evidence I included a copy of the program or a thank-you note from the manager of a nursing home where my students had performed. I mentioned that performance opportunities allowed my students to gain confidence and stage presence, as well as a broader understanding of musical styles. I also wrote about attending my state 's music conference and described how I had used the activities I learned there in my classroom. I included a note from a second-grade teacher who had asked me to teach a song about simple machines. She was amazed that the students sang the song and understood the topic before she introduced it. I included a copy of my county 's newsletter, " Music Memos, " because I am the editor. <p> One thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to student achievement. For example, I sometimes play in the orchestra for local theater productions. I enjoy it and am proud of it, but it does n't relate to my classroom instruction. On the other hand, during Music in Our Schools Month, I invite the parents to sit in on a music class. The students sing and play for their parents, then have the opportunity to teach their parents what they just did. That boosts the children 's pride in their musical accomplishments, and it communicates my classroom procedures to the parents. <p> That is the essence of the portfolio. Completing it forced me to take a good look at what I do in the classroom and beyond. I became more deliberate in my planning and more excited about the outcome of my teaching because my lessons were better. It was also exciting to review my accomplishments, noting how much music I had written for my classes, how often I had received a special note from a parent, and how much other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assessment Center Exercises <p> The Assessment Center Exercises are the written test portion of the certification process. For me, this part was much more intense than the portfolio, for two reasons :( 1) time is limited to thirty minutes per question, and( 2) this portion does not document how I teach, but rather what I know. I had not thought about some of the assessment topics since college. Most candidates I talked to felt the same way. <p> I did not begin studying for the assessment until I had packed my portfolio and mailed it back to NBPTS. Then I began reading the assessment topics and their descriptions, which can be found at http : **32;7674;TOOLONG. The topics included diagnostic skills, music history, theory/composition, instructional strategies, world music, and curricular applications. Besides the descriptions on the Web site, the elementary music series helped me review examples of world music. Also, many universities have begun to offer daylong review sessions. <p> Several of the questions involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. For example, in Exercise 1, I heard a recording of a children 's choir. Using the score, I was instructed to point out problems with the performance, tell why the problems occurred, and explain how they could be fixed. Questions for Exercise 2 on music history and Exercise 5 on world music were also based on recordings. I had to explain the historical or geographic context of the music and give reasons for my answer. <p> Exercise 3 described a certain school situation, and I was instructed to write a short piece of music for it. Parameters for the composition were given. The situation and parameters are different for general music teachers than for orchestra, choral, or band teachers, so an elementary vocalist would not be asked to write a piece for high school jazz band. <p> Assessment Exercises 4 on instructional strategies and 6 on curricular applications are more familiar to general music teachers. Often while teaching a song, I will notice that it can be used to teach a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course, whatever topic I am teaching, I try to find a variety of ways to teach it, which is what was asked for in Exercises 4 and 6. And because of my years of experience, I felt very comfortable with these two questions. For more pointers on getting through the process, see the Tips for Your Journey sidebar. Conclusion <p> I feel that becoming a National Board Certified Teacher has made me a better teacher by forcing me to think about how I plan my lessons and how I react to those unforeseen little events that happen. I had to actively include all students and plan for everyone, not just for those who are in the middle. I learned that careful planning is better than a quick fix when something goes wrong. I learned how to think ahead and fix problems before they happened. I also learned to reflect and analyze any problems that do happen, and to correct them. On the other side of the coin, I realized just how much I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence to step into leadership roles and to try new things. Alternatives to National Certification <p> National Certification is not for everyone. Many other options are available to teachers interested in furthering their education. The decision to pursue National Certification or one of these other options is a personal one. Some of the options below will result in a salary boost. Most can help you fulfill your state licensing requirements. <p> -- Get a graduate degree in music. Consider the courses offered, and think about how useful they would be in your professional development. Is the degree offered locally? Research the cost to you and the salary benefit you will receive upon completing the degree. <p> -- Get a degree in administration. Consider your professional goals. Would you like to move into an administration position? If not, this degree might not be as useful to you. Research the cost and the benefit. <p> -- Get a degree in another area of teaching. For example, many school systems in my state have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach at the elementary level and have many beginning readers, this area interests me and might be useful in my classroom. <p> -- Attend music workshops and conferences. Workshops and conferences will allow you to choose from a variety of offerings based on your personal interests as well as your areas of need. These classes often offer Professional Development Units but usually do not result in a salary increase or degree. <p> -- Take various courses offered by your school system. Staff development courses are offered on a wide variety of topics, from American Sign Language to zoology. These courses may or may not be useful in the music classroom, but they can be used to renew your state teaching certificate. Tips for Your Journey <p> -- Find a mentor. Talking to teachers who have been through the process can be a big help. They can answer your questions, proofread your entries, and help calm your nerves. The MENC Web site keeps a list of National Board Certified Teachers, as does the NBPTS site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development courses, which can taken one step at a time, National Certification must be completed in six months. Check your hectic schedule, both at school and at home. You 'll need a lot of time to review your videos, analyze your teaching, and concentrate on your writing. I went to school early and stayed late to find quiet time to concentrate. <p> -- Read the instructions. Even before you apply, you can download the instruction booklet at http : **47;7708;TOOLONG. Read it carefully and often. Then follow the instructions in detail. <p> -- Know your students and teaching style. Each of the first three entries requires you to prove yourself in a different area of teaching. Think about your yearly plans for each grade and decide which ones will best show how you implement a unit, how you pace a lesson, and how you encourage musicianship. Then choose a class from that grade level to use for that entry. <p> -- Talk to the classroom teachers. To describe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consult with the classroom teacher for specific data about the dynamics and demographics of the class. You will want the teacher to know when you plan to tape your lesson. The teachers at my school took extra pains to be on time that day and spoke to their students about the importance of good behavior. <p> -- Talk to the students. After you decide which classes to use, talk to the students about the process and its importance to you. Tell them how they can help you. Stress that they do n't have to be perfect on that day and that they do n't have to dress up. My students were proud that I had chosen their class over all the others. <p> -- Relax. Do n't be nervous in front of the video camera. Just be yourself. If necessary, videotape yourself several times before the actual taping date until you feel comfortable in front of the camera. <p> -- Collect artifacts. Entry 4 needs to be documented with programs, notes to parents, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your involvement within your school and around the community. <p> -- Work on one thing at a time. It 's difficult to concentrate on a portfolio and study for the assessment center exercises at the same time. Finish one, then begin the other, if possible.
