4156341 Apparel design faculty teach students fashion with eyes on the global garment-making network and the diverse cultural influences driving modern styles # From the world 's fashion capital of New York City to the streets of small-town America, the range of clothes we wear reflects our diverse personal tastes and the environments we live in. But our sense of fashion also draws on international influences, such as the diffusion of different cultures into mainstream styles and the global network for designing and creating apparel. # Globalization influences the fashion industry on every level : Stores of all types, from exclusive boutiques to superstores like Target, carry apparel by designers from a variety of backgrounds ; American designers are influenced by symbols and traditions from other cultures ; and the vast majority of our clothing is manufactured abroad. # Learning to understand and respect the global nature of the fashion industry is an essential component of the apparel design program in the Department of Fiber Science &amp; Apparel Design in the College of Human Ecology. Faculty members conduct research on these issues and bring their findings into the classroom, equipping students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the entire process of making clothing -- from sourcing materials to manufacturing, marketing, and selling garments -- as well as understanding the cultural traditions underpinning specific design aesthetics. # Apparel design professors also convey their own perspectives about diversity and globalization, teaching students to think critically about the meaning of multiculturalism in fashion. # " This is a global economy, " explained Charlotte Jirousek, associate professor of apparel design. " There are connections in everything -- in food, in technology, and, of course, in fashion. For our students, it 's important they come to understand the entire path, from a designer working on a mood board to actually dyeing the textiles and sewing them up. " # Grasping fashion 's global history # In classes, apparel students learn about the history of supply chains and textile arts across the globe to understand the complex nature of the modern fashion industry. # Jirousek, in particular, studies interactions between eastern and western cultures in fashion design and dress, particularly Turkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Her research has documented many traditional Turkish textile techniques -- rapidly disappearing due to industrialization -- and has sought to preserve their place in history. # Early in her career, Jirousek came to appreciate the eastern textile tradition and the impact of the Ottoman Empire on the history of fashion, after spending several years in Turkey with the Peace Corps. # " There 's been a tendency to ignore that part of the world even though it was a center of trade and culture, " she said. " The more I learned about that history, the more shocked I was about how absolutely blind we were to anything that happened outside of the West. " # Jirousek teaches about the history and language of design beyond European and American borders in several of her classes, including an introductory class for undergraduates, " Art Design and Visual Thinking, " and two graduate-level classes : " Aesthetics and Meaning in World Dress " and " The History of Color, Design, and Textiles. " # She also curates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 9,000 items of apparel dating from the 18th century to the present, as well as a substantial collection of ethnographic textiles and costumes. The collection allows students to view samples of apparel and textiles from across history and around the world. # Human Ecology students regularly incorporate non-western viewpoints and aesthetics into their work. Case in point : Matilda Ceesay, a senior apparel design major, created a line for the 2012 Cornell Fashion Collective runway show based on cultural traditions of her homeland, Gambia. Ceesay imagined her collection as a blend of traditional African style with more modern western trends. She called it " Njehringe, " which means " worth " in the language of the Wolof people of West Africa. " When creating my silhouettes, the object was to create a collection that was distinctly African, " Ceesay told the online magazine designboom. # Apparel design students also have the opportunity to witness the global nature of the fashion industry firsthand. Students can participate in a course that culminates in a two-week trip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by visiting everything from cotton fields to small handloom shops to state-of-the-art factories. " The whole array is possible, and they see the reality of it all, " Jirousek said. # Assistant professor Tasha Lewis, who joined the FSAD department last winter, teaches about the global economics of fashion. She 's studied, for instance, how small-scale fashion designers and businesses operate under the North American Free Trade Agreement and how designers in Mexico and Panama reference traditional cultural elements in their work. # " A lot of countries have contemporary designers and markets where people are trying to export their cultural identity, " she said. " It 's a way to promote manufacturing in their countries, but also to create something unique and develop their national economy. " # Her research, published in the. Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management, involved a case study of two apparel businesses in Mexico. Based on the results, she developed guidelines to help small business owners and communities promote development through apparel production and export @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion trend spreads widely or becomes popular, it is called " diffusion. " When a trend moves from one culture to another, it is called " appropriation. " Both happen regularly in the fashion world, and understanding these phenomena are an essential part of the curriculum for apparel design students. # " The factor of ' cool ' often starts in a subculture, " explained Lewis, who is studying the evolution of fashion in hip hop culture. " It 's important for our students to understand how the process of diffusion happens, so that when they see something in a store window at the mall, they understand where it comes from. " # She recently completed an article in press with the journal Fashiofi Practice about the influence of hip hop culture on mainstream fashion -- specifically how Russell Simmons, co-founder of Def Jam records, created and marketed the fashion line Phat Farm. # " Early on, hip hop fashion did not have its own aesthetic, " she explained. " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapted by African-American and Latino consumers. Fans imitated what the musicians wore. Then a new wave of musicians developed their own fashion lines. " # Today, Simmons 's latest fashion line, Argyleculture, is displayed in Macy 's next to iconic American brands such as Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger. " Now hip hop brands have a larger, diverse group of consumers, " Lewis said. In her interview with Simmons, he explained the impact of hip hop culture in the context of a post-racial America, where hip hop music has a more global appeal and the fashion has followed along the same lines. # Giving students the tools to understand these types of multicultural dynamics in fashion and teaching them to think critically about all aspects of their work is a hallmark of the integrated learning experience at the College of Human Ecology. # " We teach our students about the process of diffusion and cultural appropriation so they can consider what it means in their own work, " Lewis said. " It is important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We teach them to consider all of the aspects of culture in their work. " # " This is a global economy. There are connections in everything -- in food, in technology, and, of course, in fashion. For our students, it 's important they come to understand the entire path, from a designer working on a mood board to actually dyeing the textiles and sewing them up.
