Arts ' Vital ' to Reform Efforts, Says Riley <p> Secretary of Education Richard Riley called arts education " a vital part of our effort " in a press statement released February 23. <p> The National Coalition for Standards in the Arts applauded Riley 's words in a response two days later. <p> Riley stressed the department 's commitment to supporting arts education. " As we work to improve the quality of education for all children, " Riley said, " the arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The arts -- including music, theater, dance, and visual arts -- are a unique medium for communicating what is common to all of us as human beings and what is special to each of us as creative individuals. <p> " The arts provide valuable opportunities for understanding our cultural heritage and that of all other civilizations. The arts also enhance our nation 's economic competitiveness by developing creative problem-solving skills, imagination, self-discipline, and attention to detail, " Riley continued. <p> The secretary 's statement demonstrates that the current administration is committed to making arts education a vital part of the U.S. educational agenda, according to the coalition. <p> " Secretary Riley deserves credit for recognizing the valuable role of music and the other arts in education, " said MENC Executive Director John J. Mahlmann. " It is more important than ever to have the chief educational leader of the U.S. support the inclusion of the arts in the curriculum for all children. " <p> Congressman Robert Clement( D-Tenn.), long a supporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was delighted to hear of Riley 's pledge. " I applaud Secretary Riley on his commitment to promote and implement education reform efforts that insure every child will have access to a high-quality education that includes the arts, " he said. <p> Larry Linkin, president of the National Association of Music Merchants( NAMM), said administration support " will help us create the public awareness and involvement that will be needed for widespread implementation of the new arts education standards. " <p> When the administration reveals its arts policy, said National Academy of Recording Arts &; Sciences, Inc.,( NARAS) President and CEO Michael Greene, it will become " the seminal call to redeploy resources and insure.that the arts are a mandatory core curriculum. " The coalition is made up of MENC, NAMM, and NARAS. National Culture Hangs in the Balance Says NARAS ' Greene <p> Music can help restore a sense of pride that is dangerously missing in many young people, Michael Greene, president of the National Academy of Recording Arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the 35th annual GrammyR awards broadcast on February 24. <p> " I believe, when given an unencumbered, uncensored opportunity to do so, music can serve as that important pressure release for urban and racial tension and a marvelous healing force for our society, " Greene said. <p> " We gather here tonight just a few blocks from last year 's riots. Through the Academy 's work with the children of South Central Los Angeles, some of these marvelous kids are our guests here tonight. <p> " It 's quite clear that what is dangerously missing from their lives is a sense of hope and a source of pride. Music is their primary means of communication, " he said. <p> " When kids are given the opportunity to study the arts they stay in school. Children who are exposed to music do considerably better in both science and mathematics. And when America 's minority children are shown the beautiful tapestry Of the roots of American music they are handed the keys to their cultural heritage -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mothers. <p> " And that pride instills hope, and that, ladies and gentlemen, is what we are all about here tonight, " Greene said. <p> " You as parents, you as educators, students, and government officials, must let your voices be heard in order to return the arts to the children 's lives. The very culture of our country hangs literally in the balance.
