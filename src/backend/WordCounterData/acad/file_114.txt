4016841 Section : Bioremediation Advances COST-EFFECTIVE TECHNOLOGY <p> Innovative development in recent years have greatly expanded the use of compost and the potential to recover significant portions of municipal solid waste. <p> Use of compost is no longer limited to its role as a soil amendment ; compost technologies are rapidly emerging as valuable tools in pollution prevention and pollution control. For years, proponents of compost pointed to its direct benefit of avoiding the landfill-ing of organic material and often cited enhanced nutrient enrichment in soils that have compost added. Although these benefits are impressive, the ultimate value of compost may be fully realized in its ability to be used in a myriad of innovative applications. Compost can be used for erosion control on highways, clean up of contaminants in storm water runoff, and remediation of soils contaminated with heavy metals or toxic organic compounds. <p> Concern for global warming adds yet an-other dimension to this discussion. The organic fraction of municipal solid waste( MSW) forms methane in the anaerobic environment of a landfill while it forms CO 2 in the aerobic environment of a compost facility. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warming as carbon dioxide, reduced impact on global warming is yet another benefit of composting. <p> Nationally, there are now over 3,000 community/commercial yard trimmings compost facilities, in part because 27 states have banned yard trimmings from landfills. Compost can also be made from food waste, mixed organic MSW, organic industrial sludges, and biosolids( wastewater sludges). As yard trimmings and food waste together comprise about 23 percent of MSW generation, composting these items alone can contribute substantially to meeting state waste reduction and recycling. goals. <p> Recent advances in compost research have made it possible to compost other organic wastes in about the same time as yard trimmings and food waste, improving already cost-effective compost technology. The potential feedstock for compost, then, can be increased to include any paper that has been soiled with liquid or food waste, or that is not being recovered to be made into new paper products. By including paper, yard materials, and food waste, between 40 to 50 percent of municipal solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This article provides an overview of the innovative developments that have greatly expanded the use of compost and, with it, the potential to recover a significant portion of MSW. WHAT IS COMPOST? <p> Compost is a recycled product made from the organic portion of MSW. Compost is often incorrectly confused with peat and mulch. Peat is partially decayed plant matter that is cut from marshes and wetlands and dried. Since formation of peat takes a long time, it can be classified as a nonrenewable, nonrecyclable resource. Mulch is either an organic or inorganic soil cover that is used to retard water evaporation and help maintain an even temperature. Organic mulch includes bark, wood chips and straw. Inorganic mulch includes plastic sheeting, pellets, gravel and stones. As organic wood mulch decays, it has a tendency to use the nitrogen already in the soil, reducing the amount available. This lack of available nitrogen can retard the growth of seedlings and young plants. Immature or incomplete compost is nothing more than an organic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cured compost. <p> Mature compost, on the other hand, is a humus product of microbiological degradation of plant or animal organic matter. In composting, temperatures of 130 to 150 degrees are reached by rapidly multiplying microorganism activity. At 150 degrees the moderate temperature or mesophilic microorganisms multiply with great rapidity. Unlike organic mulch, the chemical, physical and biological properties of mature, cured compost differ greatly from the raw materials used in the compost. Mature compost can degrade metals or totally eradicate many types of hydrocarbons and can permanently adsorb heavy metals making them unavailable to the metabolism of plants, man and animals. The same can not be said for mulch or peat. Different ingredients may be used to tailor the compost to satisfy specific demands for use in sandy soils, clay soils, steep slopes( appropriate particle size), and for mechanical spreading( small particle size and less than 40 percent moisture). This tailoring leads to the production of " designer compost. " WHAT ARE THE BENEFICIAL USES OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental value to its raw materials and has beneficial uses in soil enrichment, pollution prevention, and pollution reduction. When added to soils, compost adds organic bulk, increased earthworm populations, humus, and cation exchange capacity. Compost slowly and continuously releases nutrients over time, which is compatible with plant uptake, and reduces fertilizer requirements by about 50 percent. Compost increases water retention in both sandy and clay soils which results in a savings in water use. Compost has been shown to suppress plant and grass diseases and reduce the use of pesticides. Even after natural soil microbes have been reduced by application of chemical fertilizer, compost restores soil structure and microbial populations. <p> Compost also contributes to pollution prevention in several ways. Organic matter which is composted and, therefore, not sent to the landfill, helps avoid the creation of organic acids which contribute to leachate formation. The use of organic matter for corn-posting also means that there is less of this material in the landfill, thereby, reducing the production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor in global warming. Compost can also reduce both heavy metals and organic contaminants in stormwater runoff, preventing contamination of water resources. Compost reduces silting and erosion when applied to creek, lake, or river embankments or when used on roadsides and hillsides. <p> Compost contributes to pollution reduction of heavy metals as it binds heavy metals which are no longer bioavailable to humans or animals and can not migrate to water, or be taken up by plants. Compost contributes to pollution reduction of organic chemicals as it degrades or completely eliminates wood preservatives, petroleum products, pesticides and chlorinated and nonchlorinated hydrocarbons in soils. Compost also filters out odors and degrades volatile organic compounds( VOCs). TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES <p> The recent research of Dr. Francis Gouin( 1995) at the University of Maryland found that the rate of compost formation in mixed organic MSW was dependent on the carbon/phosphorous ratio. An increase in phosphorous resulted in a faster composting rate and improved cost effectiveness. Gouin 's research indicates that the production time for compost could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to three weeks when the amount of phosphorous is appropriately adjusted. When this research is completed, an analysis of comparative composting costs between MSW and other feedstocks should be made. If mixed organic MSW composting is shown to be competitive, it could become an additional solid waste management option for some communities. <p> Two important uses of high grade mature compost developed in the last few years( Stewart ; 1994) are : 1) Removal of contaminants from the nonpoint source pollution of water at commercial, industrial, and federal installations and ; 2) A compost system to remove volatile organic compounds( VOCs). At one industrial site where this patented compost storm water filter system was installed, the materials removed were phosphorous, nutrients, solvents, pesticides, herbicides, silt, zinc, lead, cadmium and copper. The filter system cost was $17,300 while a similar industrial site on the same road was serviced by a holding pond which cost $45,000. The same industrial research group developed a compost absorption and degradation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( See report on the filter system developed by William Stewart in this issue.) <p> Dr. Michael Cole( 1995), from the University of Illinois, and others have used the hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms in mature compost to reduce or eliminate many toxic materials in contaminated soils. The four groups of contaminants treated were petroleum products, wood preservatives, chlorinated and non-chlorinated hydrocarbons, and pesticides( fungicides, insecticides). Certainly a major goal of EPA activities is protection of human health, and reduction of pesticides is one important aspect. The National Academy of Sciences has stressed the danger of pesticides to young children since residues are not removed by washing organic compounds with water. <p> Dr. Rufus Chaney( 1994) from the USDA Environmental Chemistry Laboratory and others were instrumental in providing data that eventually resulted in the removal of lead from gasoline. Lead toxicity was shown to affect the neurological development of young children. Recent work by Chaney showed that lead is adsorbed to iron-rich compost/soil and does not migrate to the water table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when soil is ingested by children, lead bound by iron-rich compost/soil has significantly reduced bioavailability in the gut as reflected by lead in bones, blood or tissue. <p> Dr. William Sopper( 1993), Pennsylvania State University, demonstrated one of the most dramatic soil remediation successes with compost in Palmerton, Pennsylvania where a zinc smelter had been in operation since 1898. The site had no viable plant life, but in only 15 months both grass seed and alder tree seedlings responded to composted sludge/fly ash remediation. In this demonstration, Dr. Sopper made clear that municipal biosolids when tested and applied according to proper guidelines can be used to revegetate mine-damaged land in an " environmentally safe manner with no adverse effects on the vegetation, soil, or groundwater quality, and do not pose any significant threat to animal or human health. " Dr. Sop-per 's and Dr. Chaney 's work could have far reaching implications since in 1994, the Department of Interior reported 300,000 abandoned mine sites on federal land. <p> Dr. Harry Hoitink( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease suppression from the use of mature compost. He stated that because of the use of compost, " Those truckloads of fumigants such as methyl bromide that all nursery crops( and tobacco seedling plots) used to need are all behind us now. " Also Dr. Herbert Bryan( 1994), University of Florida Tropical Research &; Education Center, reported, " In one of our more startling experiments, compost almost eliminated macrophomina fungus from a susceptible crop of beans... untreated plot showed severe disease. " Dr. Bryan 's compost plot also required 50 percent less fertilizer. <p> The military( Green &; Admire, 1995) is also using compost for a number of innovative applications. There is a major bioremediation effort using compost underway at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina. An abandoned taxiway contaminated with petroleum compounds is being treated with a ratio of 20 percent mature compost and five percent turkey manure to 75 percent contaminated soil, successfully leading to the degradation of the petroleum products. The compost bioremediation costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incineration at $60 per ton, including $10 per ton for clean topsoil ; estimated savings at this Air Force Base is about $200,000. In addition, the U.S. Army is doing extensive research on the composting of explosives contaminated washout lagoons at Umatilla Army Depot in Oregon. The U.S. Navy is experimenting with a closed vessel system, composting mixtures of explosives-contaminated soil and compost feedstock at Bangor, Washington. CONCLUSION <p> The role of compost is no longer limited to its use as a soil amendment. Developments over the past two decades have greatly expanded the use of compost as a cost-effective technology in pollution prevention/control and bioremediation, and with these developments comes the added potential to recover a significant portion of our municipal solid waste stream. Compost has been shown to be effective at treating nonpoint source pollution ; removing VOCs ; degrading hydrocarbons and pesticides, and binding metals in contaminated soils ; suppressing plant disease ; and revegetating barren lands. All this occurs at a fraction of the cost of conventional technologies. <p> Although the last two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production and its use in pollution remediation of soil, some of those using higher cost traditional procedures have been reluctant to compare their methods with compost technology for a variety of reasons resistance to new ideas, loss of market share, and lack of knowledge of its capabilities. During these times of budget constraints, rather than postponing or ignoring compost bioremediation, decision-makers should give strong consideration to using compost technologies( alone or in concert with other procedures) to prevent pollution of air and water resources. <p> PHOTOS( BLACK &; WHITE) : Composted municipal biosolids and lime are applied( left) on a stripmine in Somerset County, Pennsylvania at a rate of 90 dry tons per acre.
