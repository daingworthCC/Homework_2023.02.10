4117141 In this article the author discusses the role that committees play within a university 's bureaucracy. This article takes a close look at key committees on the university campus and how they shape policy and practice. It explores how committees can prove to be a vital and needed avenue to change. The author sees committees as " the life blood of a university " and discusses how they have become ingrained and institutionalize within the university system regardless of the size of the institution. The article concludes that although committees are flawed and often used to trumpet personal agendas they can in the end be beneficial to the smooth and efficient running of a university. </p> The dreaded nine letter word that spreads loathing and frustration throughout the academic community. Those within the university setting know the word all too well. Even though most universities require their personnel to serve on at least one or two annually, z many individuals spend a good deal of their time avoiding participation on them. Both within and outside of academia the perception of committee work is usually quite negative. Fred Allen called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a group decide that nothing can be done. " This belief that committees hinder and forestall needed change is quite prevalent within many universities. As a result, often committees are seen as ineffective and its members ' efforts viewed as a waste of valuable time. The reality is though, that whether or not they are seen as inefficient, they are indeed crucial to higher education. They are in fact the life blood of a university. No matter the size of the school, no matter its mission or focus, no matter the breath of its resources, committees are an integral institutionalize part of the day to day running of any institution. Throughout a university there are many different types of committees designed to fulfill specific functions within well defined areas of influence. </p> The University Level Committee work on the university level is seen as critical to a school 's mission. There are many committees formed on this level to meet specific needs. Some are more important than others. One of the most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps develop a university 's vision as well as formulate strategies to plan and guide the institution 's future. There are also varied leadership committees on the university level that work to teach effective leadership skills to present and future leaders at the school. Other important university committees include budget committees, tenure granting committees, and curriculum committees, to name but a few. Each and every one of these committees is tasked to deal with issues that affect the institution as a whole. </p> The Department Level On the department level there is also a wide array of committees. Some of these are faculty based including faculty hiring committees, tenure recommendation committees, and handbook committees. Others such as department curriculum committees deal with the development, revision, and implementation of new courses or programs. There can be accreditation or assessment committees on the departmental level as well. There can even be committees designed to self police department policies and personnel. </p> The Student Level Universities establish key student centered committees. These include committees dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student appeals about grades, or readmission, or even faculty complaints. There are also committees to monitor the progress of students, and still others to set academic and disciplinary policies and procedures. All are viewed as vital for providing a quality education to the students. </p> The Committee Structure Committees can be standing committees with fixed responsibilities or temporary ad hoc committees, including taskforces established to accomplishing specific goals. These temporary committees include such entities as steering committees for accreditation, budget committees, crisis committees, building committees, fundraising committees, and even flu committees. Within the organizational bureaucratic structure of the committee framework committees are often divided into sub-committees. These smaller versions of the larger committee are assigned specific goals to achieve. The belief is that people working on specific tasks will function more efficiently. These sub-committees also in theory work to promote shared governance by involving a larger number of faculty and staff, who in turn provide more input and greater " buy in " to the goals of the committee. </p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be literally dozens and dozens of committees all working simultaneously and supposedly in coordination with each other. Together they greatly impact the daily work and lives of faculty, staff, and students. </p> Ineffective Committees Charles Kettering said that " If you want to kill any idea in the world today, get a committee working on it. " </p> It is true that some committees are inefficient and some actually hinder more than help the overall goals of a university. In fact, at times some committees make a concerted effort to derail any new initiatives. This can be done for several reasons. Committees may simply decide to maintain the status quo out of fear of causing problems. In conjunction with this is the belief that no one can get into trouble if nothing is done. At other times the thought is that if no initiatives are moved forward, than no extra work and no new resources would be required. When any of these occurs important opportunities to make valuable changes are thwarted. </p> It is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision will be correct or in the best interest of a university or its students. David Coblit points out " A committee can make a decision that is dumber than any of its members. " </p> Although committee participation can be a time consuming inefficient process which can often be frustrating and produce questionable results at times, for the most part the use of committees is preferable to the alternative. This would be a top down decision making model with very little input from departments, faculty, staff, or students. </p> New Initiatives Committees, if utilized effectively, can be successful avenues for planting seeds for important ideas. For example, if an individual wishes to champion a special initiative or bring an important idea to the forefront, that person can begin by introducing the idea at a committee meeting. If that individual then serves on a second committee the idea can then be reintroduced at that committee 's meeting as well with the additionally benefit of being able to state that the idea had been already discussed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divulge the fact that it was the individual who presented the idea initially. It is sufficient to state that the idea was discussed elsewhere. </p> The key here is for an individual to be on as many committees as possible so the process can be repeated over and over again gaining more momentum each time. Eventually, as this momentum grows the individual will be able to reintroduce the idea in committee after committee and report that the initiative is being discussed on a wide scale in multiple committees. </p> Consequently, as the idea is discussed in a number of committees in this manner there is less and less incentive for someone to challenge the idea since " it is being discussed all across campus. " Effectively employing this strategy also gives an individual the opportunity to piggyback one idea on another. </p> Personal Incentives The key for any individual working within a university is to select the proper committees on which to serve. Careful selection and participation in the more important and influential committees will not only provide opportunities to develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's own personal sphere of influence in the process. </p> Committee participation can be advantageous for the individual in several other ways. </p> Actively serving and especially chairing a committee, makes the individual seem dedicated to a university and its causes. These committees also work to build personal power bases by allowing the individual greater input into the decision making process and by providing the opportunity to network with key university personnel. </p> Committee participation also provides those who work on them the opportunity to gain inside knowledge and information not available to those who do not serve. This knowledge allows committee members to have a better understanding of what is occurring on campus and to see the " bigger picture " regarding campus strategies, allocation of resources, initiatives, and even campus politics. They are privy to both current and future university plans and goals. This information can prove invaluable on many levels. </p> Conclusions In the final analysis most committees are effective and are beneficial to the smooth and efficient running of a university. As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an integral part of the operation of any campus. </p> More importantly, committees will also continue to serve as the venue for academic change within a university. Therefore it just makes good sense for an individual to serve on as many committees as time and energy will allow. This service will most assuredly result in both professional and personal gain for any individual who is willing to put in the extra effort. </p> If individuals understand the real importance of committee work they may be able to see that this nine letter word called " committee " can lead to another more sought after nine letter word, " promotion ; " promotion of an individual 's ideas ; promotion of an individual 's professional success ; and promotion of an individual 's personal influence and power. </p> As Graham Summer so rationally advocated " If you live in a country run by committee, be on the committee. " This advice is well worth heeding. </p> References Allen, F.( 2011). **25;53817;TOOLONG </p> Coblit, D.( 2011 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. **25;53871;TOOLONG </p> Summer, G.( 2011). **25;53898;TOOLONG </p> By Joseph Simplicio, Dr., Educational Consultant </p>
