4011241 Go on from where you left off, said Mr. Magershon, not from where you began. Or are you like Darwin 's caterpillar?( n1) <p> Caterpillar logic provides the model for Samuel Beckett 's production, where series upon series go on from where they begin, where " going on " finally takes priority over all ends. And where Beckett leaves off, without having finished, we find Bruce Nauman(n2) revolving it all again, leaving us differently at the same spot somewhere in the middle, so that Nauman 's work agitates in the same way that the events at Mr. Knott 's agitate Watt : <p> What distressed Watt in this incident of the Galls father and son, and in subsequent similar incidents, was not so much that he did not know what had happened, for he did not care what had happened, as that nothing had happened, that a thing that was nothing had happened, with the utmost formal distinctness, and that it continued to happen, in his mind, he supposed, though he did not know exactly what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him, before him, about him, and so on, inexorably to unroll its phases, beginning with the first( the knock that was not a knock) and ending with the last( the door closing that was not a door closing), and omitting none, uninvoked, at the most unexpected moments, and the most inopportune.( Watt, p. 76) <p> Reading Nauman through Beckett, our discussion can only retrace these lines. Nonetheless, by revisiting " The old thing where it always was, back again "( Watt, p. 44), we find ourselves in hot pursuit of nothing, which is exactly where Beckett and Nauman wanted to place us. It 's a little too like running Lewis Carroll 's Caucus-race, and we can start and stop where we like( since everybody wins by sheer virtue of having at some point run). As a matter of consistency, however, we could keep pace with Watt, whose first memory of the Galls coming to tune Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first( the knock that was not a knock)... <p> Think of sound specifically, as the knock that begins an encounter, with Nauman 's single-channel video Wall-Floor Positions( 1968). The work can be seen( without playing the tape) in a succession of photographic stills to reveal Nauman, acting a bad version of the sideshow contortionist. In these closely cropped frames, Nauman assumes every position except for the vertical one, turning the entire body into a single part-object that refuses to produce symmetry. By themselves, the pictures initiate a certain discomfort through an insistence on horizontality. What can not be guessed without playing the tape, however, is that the crucial aspect of Wall-Floor Positions is the first moment, when Nauman enters the frame, falling into focus with a thud. Each subsequent pose is carried off with a similar slam of foot or hand. Each noise, in turn, cocoons itself within what seems an unendurable pause. Such passages " from silence to sound and from sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the incessantly recurring events of Watt 's memory, no less than our experience of Nauman 's looping videos or Beckett 's regressive plays. This passage of sound is what strikes first and hardest in Wall-Floor Positions, making similar impact in Beckett 's 1966 television play Eh Joe.( n3) After moments of solitary quiet, paranoid Joe ventures toward the window of his bare room, suddenly drawing apart the curtains with a violent rattle. A lull follows, broken again when Joe approaches the second window and rips the drapes apart once more. The unexpected noise, jolting enough at first, becomes doubly alarming in its reiteration. For now, concentrate on this fact, that the sound must happen, in Beckett as in Nauman, always more than once. <p> In order for a knock to be a knock, which might be recognized as " someone at the door, " the sound must normally recur, the second proving that the first was not just the banging of a branch but the work of communication. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signals " that the uttered sounds do not represent a babble, but a senseful, semantic entity. "( n4) What if, on the other hand, as Watt proposes, the knock is not simply a knock, in that it occurs not twice, but too many times? What happens, for instance, when a word is repronounced until that senseful semantic entity collapses into a series of too-distinct phonemes? The result is not simply babble. Rather, what the excess finally signals is its own presence. The sound then, not of someone at the door, but of knock-knock-knock-knock -- and this mechanism of repetition.... in subsequent similar incidents... <p> Jacques Derrida describes repetition not as posterior to the origin, but somehow simultaneous with it, " a trace which replaces a presence which has never been present. "( n5) The notion of an autonomous origin, then, is a kind of lure, a fantasy : <p> The first book, the mythic book, the eve prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center was sheltered from play : irreplaceable, withdrawn from metaphor and metonomy, a kind of invariable first name that could be invoked but not repeated. The center of the first book should not have been repeatable in its own representation. Once it lends itself a single time to such a representation -- that is to say, once it is written -- when one can read a book in the book, an origin in the origin, a center in the center, it is the abyss, is the bottomlessness of infinite redoubling?( n6) <p> Affirming, like Jakobson, that signs are born in their capacity to be repeated, Derrida goes on to venture that at the mystical center where there is no such play of origin, we find death. Repetition is thus conceived not as supplementary accumulation, but as an essential operation, as the " bottomlessness " that provides the very grounds for existence. It finds voice in Beckett 's and Nauman 's production, when a spoken phrase becomes a maddening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeming sameness. Through these repetitions, refusing an isolated origin, Beckett anti Nauman show being, so that one might have mentioned to the other, as did Estragon to Vladimir, " We always find something, eh, Didi, to give us the impression we exist "( n7) <p> And this " something, " constantly rehearsed, is often precisely nothing. Nothing but the phrase " lip synch " whispered until the throat dries( Nauman, Lip Synch 1968), nothing but the strum of D, E, A, D on a violin until the arm tires( Nauman, Violin Tuned D E A D 1969), nothing but the sound of a woman 's relentless pacing across the stage( Beckett, Footfalls 1976). These exercises, however, consistently maintain themselves as failed affirmations, as finally only " impressions, " which in their patent actuality always ever return to the question " We exist? " For this is also the function of repetition, to unmake the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of model and copy, as Derrida describes : " We are faced then with mimicry imitating nothing ; faced, so to speak, with a double that doubles no simple, a double that nothing anticipates, nothing at least that is not itself already double. "( n8) Rather than reaffirming the identity of the one, repetition inspires the rabid production of another, from which the one can not extricate itself, but with which it will never be identical. It is this relationship of nonidentity, somewhere between parasitic and symbiotic, which Beckett and Nauman force their characters to endure with every recurrence?( n9) <p> In Nauman 's video installation Clown Torture( 1987), four different clowns, one after another, tell the same joke while balancing on one leg : " It was a dark and stormy night. Three men were sitting around a campfire. One of the men said, ' Tell us a story, Jack, ' and Jack said, It was a dark and stormy night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the men said, " Tell us a story, Jack, " and Jack said, " It was a dark and stormy night... '.... On its own the joke enacts with marvelous economy the disruptive brand of repetition theorized by Derrida. Around the campfire is spun a tale of " infinite redoubling " in which no origin can be isolated. The joke exists without author and, under Nauman 's unfunny direction, is even robbed of its object. The only logic to the joke is one identified by Freud in his famous study, which observes that intrinsic to the " joke-work " is the process of its being told -- in other words, of its being repeated.( n10) Through each recital, performed now by an Emmett Kelly clown, then by a French baroque type, now by a jester, then by a clown in polka dots and big shoes, the similar incident spins into a series of what Derrida would call differends, terms in which " difference inscribes itself without any decidable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( nll) Creating a confusion between two clowns and then four( without there ever having been one in the first place), Nauman 's Clown Torture enacts this doubling, proving that even in the face of infinite regress,( n12) " It 's never going to be the same.... "( n13) <p> Implicated in this specular mechanism is an elimination, partly of narrative and completely of eschatology. Take Nauman 's video Bouncing in the Corner( 1968). Despite dissimilarities among its beats, the stream of thumps produced as Nauman bounces his body into the corner of a studio still engages a continuity, a reassurance that the action is only minimally changing, only repeating. Nauman aptly describes the function of sound, here acting as if " to whistle down a dark space -- say cellar stairs -- and fill the void to make sure that nothing else is in there. "( n14) Sound, in other words, assuring us of an absence, so that we can shut our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thud, be fairly certain that we have missed nothing. The experience, something like listening to the Weather Channel on TV while getting dressed in the morning.... and that it continued to happen... <p> In Clown Torture, no punchline, no denouement, just a shaggy-dog tale constantly rewound. As such, I could run the tape as I would run the Caucus-race, start and stop where I like. The order, while perhaps not irrelevant, is certainly changeable in the fashion of Watt 's narration : " As Watt told the beginning of his story, not first, but second, so not fourth, but third, now he told its end. Two, one, four, three, that was the order in which Watt told his story "( Watt, p. 215). Nauman names such a format " this circular kind of story. " It goes back, he says, <p> to Warhol films that really have no beginning or end. You could walk in at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still asleep, or whatever. The circularity is also a lot like La Monte Young 's idea about music. The music is always going on.... It 's a way of structuring something so that you do n't have to make a story,( n15) <p> In order to understand what Nauman means by referring to a story that is n't a story, but more like circular music, we might first think of tempo. <p> In his introductory essay for Alain Robbe-Grillet 's pair of novels Jealousy and In the Labyrinth, Roland Barthes makes a distinction between two concepts of time.( n16) The first one, classical, transforms with a reason, an ulterior motive : glory, decay, disappearance. Barthes contrasts this with Robbe-Grillet 's temporality, during which " an object, described for the first time at a certain moment in the novel 's progress, reappears later on, but with a barely perceptible difference. It is a difference of a situational or spatial order -- what was on the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "( n17) Transformation here consists of permutation without decay, disappearance, or mystery : " time is never a corruption or even a catastrophe, but merely a change of place, a hideout for data. "( n18) Nauman often refers to his work as data : " Lack of information input( sensory deprivation).... Pieces of information which are in skew ' rather than clearly contradictory, i.e., kinds of information which come from and go to unrelated response mechanism. "( n19) Using information to take time, using time as a way of structuring information, Nauman 's work lends itself to the logic of videotape and television chatter. <p> Mary Ann Doane describes television as " the textual technology of information theory, "( n20) whose effect is rigorous decontextualization and the abolition of narrative. The important distinction Doane makes, however, is that television does not merely transmit this flow of information in its fragmented, multiple form, but dramatizes it through catastrophic interruptions. These discontinuities veil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event, disguising machine time in the operations of classical time. Beckett and Nauman expose these theatrics, using them to insist precisely on the uneventful. Laying bare the structure of what Stanley Cavell calls television 's " undialectical " serial procedure,( n21) Beckett and Nauman harp on noncatastrophic intrusions that fail utterly to destabilize a stable condition, returning always to the show " already in progress. " Understanding that TV flow is really " segmentation without closure, "( n22) Beckett and Nauman make us watch as events cut through the series without ever successfully leaving their mark. <p> In Beckett 's color-television play, Quad I, four mimes pace around a square, " each following his particular course. "( n23) Accompanied by a lively percussion, they walk feverishly, dropping in and out of the race in seemingly ordered sequence. To this fifteen-minute play Beckett wrote a five-minute sequel, Quad II. The action is essentially the same, but now with only two mimes, shot in black-and-white, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue pacing around the square. " Yes, " Beckett said, " marvelous, it 's 100,000 years later. "( n24) Between Quad I and Quad H lies a space of one hundred thousand years, but nothing much has changed. Beckett 's time remains unperturbed by incident. As Barthes describes, " it is an unwonted time, a time for nothing. "( n25) <p> In Nauman 's Violent Incident( 1986) a drama is enacted twelve times simultaneously, in a bank of television monitors. Nauman 's proposal for the work is simple : woman pulls chair out from under man, she gooses him, exchange of epithets, scuffling, she gets shot, he gets shot.( n26) The scene is replayed in several variations : between two men, between two women, roles reversed, in slow motion, as a rehearsal, using differing color schemes, and so on. In these multiple views, the installation mobilizes Cavell 's concept of television as a space of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n27) The bank of screens, Cavell suggests, provides the best access to television, allowing for a " switching " from one instance to the next, conveniently, in case something were to happen. Necessary to the logic of television 's continuance, however, nothing ever does, and we are left in a state of perpetual suspense. The violent incident replays itself over and again, without death ever lending a point to the drama ; the gunshot proves to be not at all what we were waiting for. It was just another piece of information, like Beckett 's Quad, marking an " unwonted time. " <p> Or, to put it differently, in subjugating the event to a constant stream of simultaneity, Nauman has succeeded in mapping spatially what is characteristically conceived linearly, as time line. Jean-Luc Nancy describes the appropriateness of line for graphing " pure time " : " And so it is with good reason that the line representing it represents the static, unidimensional, nonspatial copresence of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the limit where space becomes pure time, but where pure time annuls the event). "( n28) Pure time annuls the event, in being marked not as a thing which itself takes place, which creates and destroys. Rather, pure time exists as a series of " at onces " : " It is the altered sameness of time -- the untimeliness of time -- and it is thus that it is spacing, or that it is insofar as it spaces itself ' out. "( n29) Violent Incident produces this " altered sameness " : in one take the man shoots last, in another, the woman( what was once on the right is now on the left). And, as Nancy argues, this undialectical procedure requires a separation, a displacement ; but now, instead of dashes on a line, Nauman( and Beckett too) will tick, like a clock. <p> As with Wall-Floor Positions, even when the viewer leaves the bank of screens, he/she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describes the audio effect of a particular installation at Whitechapel : " Because it was in a separate room, the sound was baffled ; you only got the higher tones. So the main thing you heard throughout the museum was Asshole! ' "( n30) Imagine it, wandering through the exhibition, surrounded by normal, ambient noise, and then, every few minutes or so, a scream -- " 9! " -- reminding you of the fact that in spite of your absence, the incident continues to take place. Significantly, the scream recurs within spaces, between pockets of rest filled with every other sound, giving the false impression of somehow being over. A kind of rhythm is produced then, an oscillation that marks the persistence of goings-on intermittently, within blankets of white noise, punctuated by a high-pitched yell....( the door closing that was not a door closing)... <p> Consider this rhythm during which, amplified along with the word " Asshole!, " is all that comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves forward. It seems in cases to promise a kind of closure, and instead delivers a prolongation of suspense, "... the perpetual suspense of a tear that can never be entirely formed nor fall.... "( n31) Nauman and Beckett do nothing but point to this almost-shutting that is the sound of Wall-Floor Positions, where a slam is always re-marked by a reopening, a silence. The pause is empty, and noticeably so, in order to distinguish itself as trap, as that space wherein information, data, stuff, accumulates and reformulates irrepressibly. Through Mallarme, Derrida has theorized this blank : <p> A folding back, once more : the hymen, " a medium, a pure medium of fiction, " is located between the present acts that do n't take place. What takes place is only the entre, the place, the spacing, which is nothing, the ideality( as nothingness) of the idea. No act, then, is perpetrated( " Hymen... between perpetration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crime?( n32) <p> A hymen, figured by the white crease between two pages of a book( or fifteen minutes between two acts of a play). <p> Waiting for Godot contains an intermission. The curtained stage marks the space of possibility and anticipation, which make all the more resonant the maddening recurrences on the stage of Act 2 : " Next day. Same time. Same place, " and Vladimir 's first words to Estragon, " You again! "( Waiting for Godot, p. 430).( n33) What becomes painfully apparent then is that the play is precisely this curtained stage, this space of no-event and perpetual waiting. Boasting of their endurance in this place, Vladimir will remark to Estragon, " We are not saints, but we have kept our appointment "( Waitingf0r Godot, p. 458). Godot, however, will never keep his appointment, and the play brackets nothing but this missed encounter : a meeting that was presumed to occur never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Act 2 signals no end, but a lingering nonfinality, the suspense of a pause( a tear) hovering between. Not too much unlike the brief switch between monitors, or as a video loops back around to the beginning. Violent Incident is marked by such hiccups, disturbances that call attention to what seems like the substance, the point of the work. Again, what one finds is that switch and flicker are all of Violent Incident. No crime is committed, nothing is perpetrated. " Asshole! " is only part of the ambient noise after all, signaling nothing, except perhaps an appointment. The incident, it turns out, is about monitoring, waiting in between acts. <p> At the 1997 Whitney Biennial, Nauman 's video installation was called End of the World, leading one to expect an apocalypse, only to be met with some sad song perpetually dying. A series of three projected videos replayed differing takes of the same man( whose body is always cropped so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( too many layers to know for sure), on a pedal steel guitar( every one slightly altered from the last). The videos of each projection were segmented, stopping and starting in a kind of nonthematic orchestration, like entr'acte organ music. Certainly in this constant making and unmaking, there was no cataclysmic explosion then, only a lingering trace, a vestige, characterized by Nancy through " its infinite finishing( or infinishing) and not its finite perfection.( n34) According to Nancy, art defines itself precisely through the vestigial, " infinishing, " nonessential : <p> The vestigial is not an essence -- and no doubt this is what puts us on the track of " the essence of art. " That art is today its own vestige, this is what opens us to it. It is not a degraded presentation of the Idea, nor the presentation of a degraded Idea ; it presents what is not " Idea " : motion, coming, passage, the going-on of coming-to-presence.( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have mentioned, which Nauman and Beckett both insist on, pointing always to the end, traversing it but never arriving there, a perpetual nonpenetration " without breaking the ice or the mirror. "( n36) Steven Connor discusses this compulsive relishing of the ending 's immanence in Beckett, citing the last passage from Ill Seen, Ill Said : <p> Farewell to farewell. Then in that perfect dark foreknell darling sound pip for end begun. First last moment. Grant only enough remain to devour all. Moment by glutton moment. Sky earth the whole kit and boodle. Not another crumb of carrion left. Lick chops and basta. No. One moment more. One last. Grace to breathe that void. Know happiness.( n37) <p> During End of the World, this is the promise of every silence that breaks the stream of steel-pedal guitar, the anticipation of " One moment more, " of the relishing of space within an " end begun, " so that end therefore resides at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version of " The End of the World, "( n39) Nancy, like Nauman, invokes not a dark apocalypse but a clarity of realization : that there is no " end " in the sense of determinable liquidation with its antipode of birth. In other words, no " once and for all, '... but the spacing of all onces. ' "( n40) Brilliantly, Nauman and Beckett engender this finitude, folded within the structure of infinity, the uneventful displacements of " pure time. " And through this spacing, which enables a continual surging forth and retreat, enter End of the World, like Violent Incident, Quad, Footfalls, Wall-Floor Positions... engaged in a rhythm. Nancy characterizes the perpetual progress( not passage) of the vestige 's infinite finishing in just such terms : <p> This rhythm comprises sequence and syncopation, trajectory and interruption, gait and gap, phase and spasm. It thereby cuts a figure, but this figure is not an image in the sense I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, or the vestige, is its tracing, its spacing.( n41)... and though it seemed to be outside him, before him, about him... <p> And what if this spacing were to consist in beating one 's entire body against the corner of a wall, as Nauman did in his video Bouncing in the Corner( 1968)? The knock would signify, once again not someone at the door, but a collision of body and matter. This impact resonates in Nauman and Beckett. Sound produces the difficulty of existing among things, of having sense. In Beckett 's 1957 radio play All That Fall, considerable airtime is given to grunting and groaning, as the heavyset and rickety couple Maddy and Dan Rooney maneuver into cars, tip stairs, down roads.( n42) Again, what makes the performance exhausting to hear is this strained effort, figured in a rhythm painfully maintained, as the Rooneys inch their way back from the train station toward their home. And prototypically for Beckett, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In Beckett 's 1976 stage play Footfalls, the disheveled, aged May speaks with or to an offstage voice accompanied by the sound of her own pacing, to and fro in the dark. While May paces, the single voice recites this schizophrenic narration : <p> The mother : What do you mean, May, not enough, what can you possibly mean, May, not enough? May : I mean, Mother, that I must hear the feet, however faint they fall. The mother : The motion alone is not enough? May : No, Mother, the motion alone is not enough, I must hear the feet, however faint they fall.( n43) <p> Striking the ground, touching it is not enough. There must be an excess of sense, a vestige of movement which consists in this pulse, however faint, of pacing. Slightly different in dynamic, perhaps, from the slam of Wall-Floor Positions, the beat in both is never metronomic, but the irregular pulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In describing the music of Schumann, Barthes describes such a rhythm, of pure violence, invested in the body that " speaks but says nothing. "( n44) Of Schumann 's Kreisleriana, Barthes writes, " No, what I hear are blows : I hear what beats in the body, what beats the body, or better : I hear this body that beats. "( n45) Beating the body into music without the relay of a signifier, this is the power of Schumann 's rhythm, which explodes and rages, but never expresses. Similarly, if in Nauman 's tightly cropped loops of tape, a torso is extracted, a head lopped off, if on Beckett 's darkened stage only a mouth emerges, a cowled figure scurrying, a hooded lump, what bears the body into presence is this beating( shuffling, slamming, bouncing) that is at once the sense of touching or hearing something outside the body, and the vestige that points to the sense of having touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Schumann 's violent rhythm as madness. Incorporating this pulse, Nauman 's installation Learned Helplessness in Rats, Rock and Roll Drummer( 1988) is a laboratory for just such destabilization, engaged here by the double accompaniment of a different sort of beat. On one wall, a video projection alternates, clicking regularly from shots of a rat in a Plexiglas maze, to live footage from a surveillance camera hovering in the room, to a recording of the drum session that produced the installation 's obnoxious sound track. Madness here, however, is not so much caused by the loudly pounding drum riffs, but by the tact that this noise, made somewhere and sometime else by the boy in the video, strikes the body immediately in this small room. What actually sets the viewer reeling is this constant shift, amplified by each mechanical click of the sequencer, switching the projection from prerecorded drummer/rat( then) to live surveillance footage( now). With every shift Nauman strips away the moorings of past-present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tremble in between.( n46) <p> Engaging this perpetual temporal implosion, Nauman pries apart the seam between now and then, the distance typically screened by the television set. Imposing a remote, other vision on a situated viewer, television creates what Samuel Weber refers to as " undecidability, " a condition that the screen itself simultaneously masks and marks.( n47) Nauman wants to expose this " undecidability, " showing how television 's confusion of time also produces a confusion of substance, a sense of being -- as Weber notes -- " neither fully there, nor entirely here. " Appropriately then, while Nauman 's beat attacks before/after, it collapses inside/outside on the way.... in his mind, he supposed, though he did not know exactly what that meant... <p> In Beckett 's stage play Not I( 1972), a disembodied mouth, surrounded by black curtain, is slowly born into light, chattering faster and faster without skipping a beat, slowing only at the intermittent refrain of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!... she! "( n48) In Not I, constant bafflement, about what comes from within the mouth( mind) and what : bombards from without. The mouth struggles to keep pace with its own thoughts( which it can not be sure are its own).( n49) Nauman 's sixty-minute black-and-white video Lip Synch( 1968) uses the same bodiless orifice, this time suspended upside down by the camera. What is most disturbing about Nauman 's mouth is the tempo of repronounced words, " Liiiip... Sin.... k, " which almost seem to come from it, pronounced according to Barthes 's definition, wherein pronunciation emerges " from the depths of the body 's cavities, " manifesting the materiality of signifier-sounds, rubbing against the message in a kind of perverted friction.( n50) We hear and see this grating in Lip Synch when the mouth closes and swallows after a tiring string of speech, when the throat clears itself of accumulated saliva, when the microphone pops with every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ k/Most alarming about these sounds, however, is the fact that their synchronization with the mouth on-screen wavers, engendering a perpetual undecidability, as the embodied materiality of voice collides with the absence of a coherent body. <p> In Think( 1993), Nauman 's head bounces up and down on two television screens, one above the other, the camera tightly focused so that only the top of Nauman 's head comes into full view, with the occasional peep of mouth ostensibly chanting as he bounces, " Think! Think! Think! " The laser-disc recordings are twinned, but once again not synchronized. The looped segments vary : a snowy image with sound distortion, " Think! " punctuated by clashing cymbals, top screen upside down, bottom screen right side up, vice versa, and so on. What remains constantly clear is the initial impression : that it is difficult to match which voice to which bobbing head, that it is preposterous to follow the imperative " Think! Think! Think! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the echo that must, yet does not, seem to come from the on-screen/onstage fragment is a familiar discombobulating technique, one used in the romantic song : <p>... what is suggested, what is here vocally put before us, is the anguish of something that threatens to divide, to separate, to dissociate, to dismember the body. The dark voice, voice of Evil or of Death, is a voice without site, a voice without origin : it resonates everywhere... in every case, it no longer refers to the body, which is distanced in a kind of non-site.( n51) <p> Nauman and Beckett are both expert in producing this voice without a site, afflicting a kind of sitelessness, described by Nauman in terms of an early corridor piece : <p> It had to do with going up the stairs in the dark, when you think there is one more step and you take the step, but you are already at the top... or going down the stairs and expecting there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom. It seems that you always have that jolt and it really throws you off. I think that when these pieces work they do that too.( n52) <p> Playing on an expectation, that the sound will be sutured to the on-screen image, that it will come from a body, Nauman produces a jolt. In Think, shock and frustration are doubly pronounced as Nauman confounds this aural dislocation with an explicit mental sitelessness, making ridiculous the Hegelian notion of thought as a realm of pure interiority : <p> Thinking, however, results in thought alone ; it evaporates the form of reality into the form of the pure Concept, and even if it grasps and apprehends real things in their particular character and real existence, it nevertheless lifts even this particular sphere into the element of the universal and ideal wherein alone thinking is at home with itself.... Thinking is only a reconciliation between reality and truth within thinking itself. But poetic creation and formation is a reconciliation in the form of a real phenomenon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( n53) <p> Nancy articulates an interruption in Hegel 's model, of art " conceived as the derived, external, and unseeing expression of the internal gaze of pure presence, "( n54) and consequently of thinking, which could ever be alone " at home with itself. " Positing sense before signification, Nancy reverses the dialectic : " thought uses itself to touch( to be touched by) that which is not for it a " content " but its body : the space of this extension and opening in which and as which it exscribes itself, that is, lets itself be transformed into the concreteness or praxis of sense. "( n55) For Nauman, like Nancy, to think touches on to jump, to crash cymbals, to scream, to hear. For Nancy, like Beckett, this process( of thought touching its body) is conceived as a step( Footfalls, " Suspended Step "). <p> Trekking back to the mind/body problem, which Rosalind Krauss identifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sound of Its Own Making( 1961), we recognize this same fracturing, whereby no substance is integral, whole. Morris 's Beckettian construction no doubt opens onto Nauman 's, also baffling the notion of founding origin, also tracing the closed circuit of consciousness everywhere to an outside line. The fiction of " internal discourse, " as attacked too by Derrida in 1969( " The Double Session "), is left perpetually under siege. Nonetheless, while mobilizing this estrangement, " exscription, " sitelessness, Beckett and Nauman still preserve the " concreteness " of sense, the specificities of situation. Their acoustic experiments have little to do with Artaud 's, as described by Denis Hollier. If Artaud would open theater to the noises of the street, " to leave the space of representation tot that, precisely of the event, "( n56) by contrast Nauman and Beckett insist on the theatricality of their works, which only mimic events. For them, sound never breaks into an exterior world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edges of stage, screen, installation. Their works depend on a relentless specificity(n57) in line with Nancy 's, in which sense is not indiscriminately dispersed, but zoned, discrete.... with the utmost formal distinctness... <p> If film has been theorized as a visual art, menaced by what Hollis Frampton, for instance, would deem the synesthetic " monster " of sound,( n58) Beckett 's directions for Film( 1964), consisting mostly of outlines and diagrams, are appropriately headed by the motto " Esse est percipi "( n59) Originally titled The Eye, Film inflicts on Buster Keaton an " anguish of perceivedness " through successive camera angles from which Keaton, designated O( the object), can not escape : " We 're trying to find a... cinematic equivalent for visual appetite and visual distaste.., a reluctant... a disgusted vision O 's and a ferociously voracious one E's. "( n60) As such, the film is silent, but not completely. There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman turns to her companion, and " checks him with a gesture and soft sssh! ' " film reverberates with this quiet exclamation echoing in silence, puncturing the circumference of film 's voracious eye with a gaping hole. <p> Addressing the attempt to stage a theater production of All That Fall, Beckett reacted harshly : <p> All That Fall is a specifically radio play, or rather radio text, for voices, not bodies. I have already refused to have it " staged " and I can not think of it in such terms.... It is no more theatre than End-Game is radio and to " act " it is to kill it. Even the reduced visual dimension it will receive from the simplest and most static of readings.., will be destructive of whatever quality it may have and which depends on the whole thing 's coming out of the dark.( n61) <p> When Beckett was proposed the transference of the stage play Act Without Words to film, he similarly replied, " If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or extricate them from the confusion that has them where they are, we might as well go home and lie down. "( n62) Ironically, however, the very means that Beckett uses in order to keep his genres " more or less distinct " rely on a technique of studied confrontation, if not confusion. Writing about All That Fall, Linda Ben-Zvi describes Beckett 's method, which constantly thwarts the medium of radio, giving anything but the impression of another world constituted by sound in its entirety. Instead, the listener remains in wondering frustration, as Beckett issues cryptic clues, pointing mercilessly to the fact that one is sitting in the dark and wants to see what 's going on. Beckett 's medium consciousness resides, then, not in forming clear lines of demarcation but in creating constant friction, always implicating " other zones of sensing " in the manner of Nancy 's toucher : <p> Sensing and the sensing-oneself-sense that makes for sensing itself consists always in sensing at the same time that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are other zones of sensing, overlooked by the zone that is sensing at this moment, or else on which this zone touches on all sides but only at the limit where it ceases being the zone that it is.( n63) <p> Beckett 's work relentlessly pursues these limits, moving increasingly toward a degree of dissolution. His formalism, therefore, could never be characterized as reductive, but more properly as explosive. As such, Quad I and H do not produce a distillation, an essence of what it is to be a television play. Indeed, they border so closely on dance that Beckett must plug the spill with a proclamation : the cowled figures are " mimes, " he says, " not dancers. "( n64) In creating this tenuous structure, however, Beckett does not deny the medium 's essence. Rather, to use Nancy 's terms again, he " entrances " it, seduces it, transverses it.( n65) <p> Like Beckett 's Film, Nauman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black-and-whites from 1969, Black Balls, Bouncing Balls, Gauze, and Pulling Mouth, are silent. Nauman will also agree that " films are about seeing, " and as such he too will produce an anguish, this time of perceiving, straining vision in his painfully decelerated slow-mos, shot at one thousand to four thousand frames per second. His videotapes, on the other hand, will not utilize this form of distortion, profiting instead from the initially accidental effects of a wild track that stretches and tightens, causing sound to go in and out of synch. Nauman himself, of course, will sound far more cavalier about his use of materials : <p> But it was simple in that in the ' 60s you did n't have to pick just one medium. There did n't seem to be any problem with using different kinds of materials, shifting from photographs to dance to performance to videotapes. It seemed very straightforward to use all those different ways of expressing ideas or presenting material. You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could make jokes about parts of the body or casting things, or whatever.( n66) <p> Nauman thus refers to working in video, film, speaking as if it were a matter of convenience, not conviction. And his projects are undeniably invested in a kind of plurality without hierarchy : video, photograph, casting, neon sign, whatever. There is, nevertheless, in this seeming " anything goes " approach, an obsessively disciplined method, which recognizes as discrete " all those different ways of expressing. " As acutely as anyone, Nauman knows what it is to watch a screen, knows the expectations( embodied voices, sutured sound-image), the rhythm( repeated illusion of narrative), the circumstances( somewhat private, somewhat not), the frustrations( endless) that attend a TV viewing. And Nauman, as madly as Beckett, will not desist in unraveling, in making and remaking, until the work resembles a Violent Incident : " I liked all this, keep taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) <p> Obviously, this method of dissection can never produce an autonomous body that one could frame and hang on the wall to look at, because it would be dripping, leaking. Neither, on the other hand, does it produce a space of nondifferentiation, of art in general. On this, Nancy writes, " However, there is no art ' in general : each one indicates the threshold by being itself also the threshold of another art. Each one touches the other without passing into it.... "( n68) Art and sense still intact, defined by thresholds, by spacing. Art that knows itself by rubbing constantly, grating its surface against another " with the utmost formal distinctness.
