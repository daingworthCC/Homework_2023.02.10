4080441 Many authors have noted an association between Mnire syndrome and migraine headache. In an attempt to explore a possible link between these two disorders, we performed an epidemiologic study. The National Health Interview Survey( NHIS) includes interviews with tens of thousands of patients annually to estimate the incidence of various diseases. In this study the data collected from the NHIS for the years 1986 to 1988 and 1994 were analyzed to determine the incidence of Mnire syndrome and migraine headache. A total of 423,400 individuals were interviewed over the combined 4 years included in this evaluation. The incidence of migraine headache was calculated at 3.8%, and the incidence of Mnire syndrome was estimated at 0.14%. The incidence of migraine headache in patients with Mnire syndrome was estimated at 4.5%. The incidence of migraine headache was not substantially elevated in patients with Mnire syndrome when compared to the general population. Mnire syndrome classically involves episodic sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, aural fullness, and vertigo. In his landmark publication in 1861, Prosper Mnire noted that many of his patients presenting with what we now know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " Some hemicranias accompanied by vomiting very often terminate in deafness.... They are accompanied by noise, vertigo, and gradual weakening of the hearing. " n1 Since that time, substantial controversy has ensued regarding a link between these two disorders. Many authors have purported an increased incidence of migraine headache in patients with Mnire syndrome. Radtke et al identified 78 patients diagnosed with Mnire syndrome according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery( AAO-HNS) criteria. n2 Telephone interviews revealed an increased incidence of migraine headaches( 57%) when compared to matched controls( 25%)( p &lt; 0.001) using the International Headache Society criteria. Parker, in a 1995 study, performed a computer review of 1,630 cases of dizziness and found 85 patients with Mnire syndrome. n3 Twenty nine( 34%) of these patients also had migraine headache ; however, the International Headache Society criteria were not used. The quoted incidence for migraine headache in the general population was approximately 18% in women and 6% in men ; this difference was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large retrospective study of migraine headache and identified 6 patients with Mnire syndrome of the 280 patients with migraine headache( 2.1%). n4 They argued that this increase over the usual incidence of Mnire syndrome( 0.05 to 0.1%) was evidence for a pathophysiologic link between the two disorders. Hinchcliffe identified 42 patients with Mnire syndrome and asked them, " Have you at any time suffered from migraine or severe headaches? " n5 He found 76% answered yes, which was statistically significant when compared to a control population. Still other studies refute such a link. In a study by Rassekh and Harker, 38 patients were selected who fulfilled the criteria for Mnire syndrome according to the AAO-HNS. n6 Of the 38 patients, 7( 18.4%) also fulfilled migraine headache criteria. This compared with a 33% incidence of migraine headache in control subjects. n6 A careful review of the literature for a link between the incidence of Mnire syndrome and the incidence of migraine headache remains inconclusive. In the hope of clarifying this controversial issue, an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Survey( NHIS) was performed. The NHIS is an annual survey of the noninstitutionalized population within the United States across ages, races, and sexes. The study is self-reported, such that patients specify whether they have a specific disease without diagnostic workup or laboratory evaluations. Methods The NHIS is a multistage probability sample survey. To ensure equal representation of minority populations, the NHIS oversamples minority groups. As a result, sampling weights must be employed to underweight the oversampled and overweight the undersampled. The survey is performed as follows : A subject is randomly assigned one of six different lists. The six lists are skin/muscle, impairments, digestive, miscellaneous, circulatory, and respiratory. Each list is presented to one-sixth of the population sampled. The exact wording in the survey is as follows : " During the last 12 months, did you have( condition listed)? " Only the diseases on one of the six lists can develop an incidence estimate. This is done by weighting the sample with the basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As migraine headache is an identifiable disease listed within the miscellaneous category, an incidence estimate can be directly generated. If the subject suffers from a disease not on the standardized list, it still can be identified by the subject. When a disease results in a functional limitation, a follow-up interview with the patient allows for identification of the nonlisted disease, which is then tabulated. A functional limitation is defined as any limitation of activity, any requirement of the subject to seek medical care, or any loss of workdays secondary to illness or contact with the healthcare system. A directed interview then identifies the disease. Mnire syndrome, because it is not on any of the surveylists, requires a functional limitation to be present in order to be tabulated. Consequently, only an estimate of the incidence can be calculated. After the subjects were surveyed and interviewed, the data were tabulated and analyzed for this study. Although the survey is done annually, only the years 1986, 1987, 1988, and 1994 were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years which the analyzing author( JA) had sufficient time to format the massive amounts of data into the searchable format required by this study. Results For the combined NHIS years 1986 to 1988 and 1994, a total of 423,400 subjects were interviewed in the survey. Of those, 69,736 subjects were given the list containing migraine as a selection. After the responses were obtained from the subjects, incidence estimates were calculated by the NHIS by first weighting the obtained sample to best approximate the noninstitutionalized population in the United States. Once the corrected sample was calculated, the incidences of Mnire syndrome and migraine headache were estimated. The results are tabulated in the table. Discussion Because Mnire syndrome was not a listed disease on any of the 6 disease categorylists presented to the subjects, the only way it could have been counted was if a respondent reported a functional limitation. As a result, only the sicker individuals with Mnire syndrome were counted because subjects with recurring Mnire syndrome who did not have a functional limitation or contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview were not included. Therefore, the incidence estimate of Mnire syndrome is likely to be somewhat biased toward underestimation of the disease and overestimation of the disease effect. However, it seems unlikely that patients with recurring Mnire syndrome would have been free of any functional limitation or would not have contacted the healthcare system given the substantial impact of the syndrome. Consequently, the bias from this technique would appear to be minimal. This study found an incidence of Mnire syndrome of 0.14%, which is comparable to other estimates reported in the literature. The incidence of Mnire syndrome has been estimated at 0.05% in Sweden and 0.1% in Britain. n7 Its incidence in Japan has been estimated at 0.05%. n8 The 3.8% incidence of migraine headache generated by this study is lower than that of most other large series. The prevalence of migraine headache from large population-based studies has ranged from 11 to 18%, n9 and the incidence of migraine headache in Western countries has been estimated at 10 to 12%. n10 Incidence is defined as the occurrence of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year. Prevalence is defined as the occurrence of a disease over the entire life span of a patient. This study reports the incidence estimates for Mnire syndrome and migraine headache, whereas most studies published have reported prevalence data. Care must be made not to confuse these two parameters. It is important to note that the incidence estimates in this study were based on information reported by the subjects and not based on a physical examination or history taken by a physician at the time of the survey. Although the majority of patients reporting any specific illness have likely been diagnosed with the disease by a physician, subjects had the opportunity to select a disease even if they had never been seen by a doctor. As a result, the incidence of migraine headache is lower than in other reported series. The likely explanation for the low self-reported incidence of migraine headache in this survey when compared to other studies is that many patients are unaware that they are, in fact, having migraine headaches. In this review, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 4.5%, quite close to the 3.8% incidence of migraine headache in the general population. Statistically, one can not calculate a p-value to compare the incidence of migraine headache in the general population with the incidence of migraine headache in Mnire syndrome. This is because the incidence of migraine headache in the general population is calculated directly, whereas the incidence of migraine in Mnire syndrome can only be estimated. However, it remains clear that no substantial increase in the incidence of migraine headaches in subjects with Mnire syndrome was seen in our study. Despite the passage of nearly 150 years since Mnire 's initial report, we still lack any laboratory or quantitative testing to definitively identify either Mnire syndrome or migraine headache. Until such testing is developed, the significant amount of overlap between the diagnostic criteria of both conditions will confound any analysis. Table.
