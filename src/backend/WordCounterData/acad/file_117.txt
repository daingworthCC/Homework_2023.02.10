4017141 ABSTRACT : Environmental participation was examined within the context of a nonformal, field program for two small groups of high school students. A model of positive environmental action was developed and revised. An examination of the model reveals that positive environmental action can not be explained easily by a focus on predictors of individual behaviors nor the manipulation of these behaviors. The results indicate that the relationships between learning and environmental action are interactive, dynamic, and greatly influenced by the participants and the social situations within which they operate. <p> In 1977, the Tbilisi conference on environmental education outlined the objective that environmental education should provide social groups and individuals with an opportunity to be actively involved at all levels working toward the resolution of environmental problems( UNESCO, 1980, p. 71). The World Commission on Environment and Development( WCED, 1987) and the 1992 United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro also reiterated that citizens must take a participatory role in environmental protection. <p> Many researchers and practitioners in environmental education have taken environmental participation goals quite seriously. Fien( 1993 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should promote participation in a variety of forms of social action to help improve and maintain environmental quality. As such, environmental participation is expected to play a role in social transformation. Others have interpreted participation to mean that people should practice environmentally responsible behaviors, and that achieving such behaviors is the ultimate goal of environmental education( Hines, Hungerford, &; Tomera, 1986-1987 ; Hungerford &; yolk, 1990 ; Ramsey, 1993). <p> Inspired in particular by the idea of environmental participation, I developed, implemented, and evaluated a nonformal environmental education program at the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize, Central America. In this article, I show how a practical environmental education experience informed the development and revision of a theoretical model of positive environmental action. During this process, some of my underlying assumptions were challenged, and the study became a critical reflection on methodology in action. I became aware that the relationships between learning in environmental education and positive environmental action can not be explained easily by a focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those behaviors. Instead, these relationships are interactive, dynamic, and greatly influenced by the participants and the social situations within which they operate. <p> Research related to environmental action and behavior has increased. Models by Hines et al.( 1986-1987) and Hungerford and yolk( 1990) show how a behavioral manipulation of many variables can result in people 's participation in desirable environmental behaviors. These works went beyond earlier explorations in environmental action and behavior( Borden &; Schettino, 1979 ; Ramsey &; Rickson, 1976) and have helped guide innovations in environmental education practice, particularly in formal schooling situations( Ramsey, 1993 ; Ramsey &; Hungerford, 1989 ; yolk, 1993). A Model of Positive Environmental Action <p> Although previous models and related research provide important background information, their usefulness was limited in the context of this study. I developed a new model of positive environmental action( Figure 1) whose three main features distinguish it from earlier models. First, it emphasizes positive environmental action instead of environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the integration of multiple student-learning areas( environmental concepts, environmental attitudes and sensitivity, action skills and procedures, and empowerment and ownership) and their combined effect on positive environmental action. Finally, the model focuses on environmental education in a nonformal, experiential setting. An Emphasis on Action <p> In its emphasis on participation, this model is similar to earlier models. However, in this model, the participation goal is more narrowly defined as action, whereas most earlier models focus on behavior, such as responsible environmental behavior( Hines et al., 1986-1987 ; Sia, Hungerford, &; Tomera, 1985-1986), or responsible citizenship behavior( Hungerford &; yolk, 1990). Positive environmental action is a deliberate strategy that involves decisions, planning, implementation, and reflection by an individual or a group. The action is also intended to achieve a specific positive environmental outcome, either small or large( Emmons, 1994). Defined as such, action has an intentional quality that may or may not characterize behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide insight on the distinction between action and behavior. Deci described the following three types of behavioral response :( a) non-self-determining, such as coercion ;( b) automatized or automatic, such as habit ; or( c) self-determined and involving the human capacity for deciding how to behave( 1980, p. 17). Behavior is a much broader concept than action in that it might be voluntary or involuntary, automatic or nonautomatic. Moreover, behavior includes basic, individual responses that may or may not be deliberate efforts toward a certain goal. <p> Environmental behavior as described in the literature may fall under either Deci 's second or third category of behavioral response, but is often presented as a final product, not a combination of product and process. For example, pupils may place recyclable materials in an appropriate container because they have formed habits or want to avoid reprimands, not because personal knowledge and attitudes have helped lead them to a process of planning and action. Thus, their use of classroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come about as a result of cognitive and affective processes, as well as the use of action skills and strategies. Either way, the result is the same. The environmental behavior is achieved, but perhaps not in the way environmental educators intended. <p> Positive environmental action can be classified only under Deci 's third type of behavioral response( self-determined), given that it requires foresight and planning and is designed to serve a specific purpose based on the individual 's decisions. This kind of action is voluntary and nonautomatic and is both a process and a product. In the case of classroom recycling, if students themselves decide to start a recycling program, they may do so in response to their knowledge and attitudes about recycling issues and are able to understand and implement appropriate strategies. They become engaged in the process of action( deciding, planning, implementing, and evaluating), aimed at a particular product( reduction of solid waste, reusing resources). Integrated Learning Goals <p> Prior research has tended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shore, 1975 ; Axelrod &; Lehman, 1993 ; Borden &; Schettino, 1979 ; Hines et al., 1986-1987 ; Hungerford &; Volk, 1990 ; Jordan, Hungerford, &; Tomera, 1986 ; Marcinkowski, 1989 ; Ramsey, 1989, 1993 ; Ramsey &; Rickson, 1976 ; Sia et al., 1985-1986 ; Sivek, 1989). Although I used other research initially in identifying important learning areas in environmental education, I found that the model of positive environmental action treats the areas not only as predictors or variables of environmental action, but also as important environmental education learning areas in and of themselves. Some earlier models present various cognitive and affective aspects in apparent isolation from one another. Others seem to regard the effects as sequential, additive, or even hierarchical. The new model is different in that it explicitly illustrates an integration of the learning areas and does not suggest a timeline for the occurrence of the various effects. The model shows four general learning areas : environmental concepts, environmental attitudes and sensitivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Although each is referred to as a different learning area, their boundaries are not necessarily well defined. <p> There has been much discussion about the integrated nature of cognitive and affective learning. According to some, cognitive and affective learning are interactive and reciprocal( Bloom, 1978 ; Brown, 1971 ; Stancato &; Hamacheck, 1990 ; Zimiles, 981). There is a suggestion within this literature that educational programs that deal with the interactions of cognitive and affective learning are more productive than programs that emphasize one or the other. As Brown 11971) pointed out, it is difficult to make learning challenging and exciting when " a teacher 's methods and curriculum are bounded by limits that ignore the student as a feeling-thinking human being "( p. 5). When considering the goal of environmental participation, educators should treat students as feeling-thinking-acting human beings. Robottom and Hart( 1995) also wrote that when environmental education concentrates primarily on a manipulation of behavior, the development of critical thinking in students is diminished. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental action guides the development of an educational program in a nonformal, field setting. Students have intensive and direct experiences in the natural environment over several days. Some have suggested that environmental sensitivity can be built best through positive contact with the natural environment( Hungerford &; yolk, 1990 ; McKnight, 1990 ; Peters-Grant, 1986) and that positive attitudes about various elements of the natural world can be increased through direct contact with them( Harvey, 1989-1990 ; Newhouse, 1991). <p> I designed the experiential element to help overcome some of the shortcomings that were identified in some school-based environmental education programs. For example, Pomerantz( 1990-1991) found that environmental education materials used in schools tend to concentrate only on basic knowledge and neglect other important learning areas. Singletary( 1992) also provided such evidence and added that many teachers are uncomfortable addressing environmental values. In addition, formal school settings often have few elements of play and enjoyment( Block, 1984). The use of a nonformal, field program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all learning areas together, removed from the constraints of a formal curriculum and school environment. Nonformal educational settings also have fewer curricular and other constraints and can provide certain motivational elements -- choice, challenge, novelty, and cooperation -- that can motivate students to learn( Brophy, 1987 ; Csikszentmihalyi, 1975 ; deCharms, 1984 ; Stipek, 1988). The Program <p> Two small groups of local high school students( a total of 10 females) were invited consecutively to the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize in April 1992 for 5 days. All students were in 9th or 10th grade and ranged in age from 15 to 20. Although environmental education opportunities for Belizean youth are on the increase, the protected areas in Belize are underused for this purpose. Female students in particular are often left out of field experiences and are less likely than male students to visit protected areas( Emmons, 1994). The students did not indicate any specific interest in nature or the environment, but they participated in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenses for the students were covered. <p> The broad learning goals in environmental concepts, sensitivity and attitudes, action skills and procedures, and empowerment and ownership were similar for both groups of students, but there were differences in the types of instruction. As part of the plan, different activities were carried out with each group. The purpose of using two different approaches was to gain an understanding of the differences that might occur in the educational processes and outcomes of the two programs. The two approaches are described briefly below.( A more complete account of the program development and implementation is found in Emmons, 1994.) <p> The first group, which contained 6 students, participated in a tacit educational program that allowed students to pursue learning and recreation at their own pace. This program was designed to resemble Fien 's( 1993) education through the environment, given that the program attempted to use student experiences in the environment as the primary educational medium. Some structured activities had been set, but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objectives remained general. The flexibility of the schedule allowed students to make group decisions on many possible activities. With the plans and goals more implicit, l expected that much of the learning would take place in situ, or as it happened, naturally. For example, an observation during a hike might spark a discussion that lasted as long as students showed interest. Unstructured activities included trail hikes, night walks, and evening meetings. Unplanned activities, such as bird watching and informal discussions, also took place. The most important structured activity for this group was an action project( described later). <p> The second group comprised 4 students. This group engaged in more structured activities, and the instruction was more explicit. This program attempted to resemble a shortened version of Fien 's( 1993) education through the environment given that the purpose was to engage students in exploring and resolving environmental issues with an emphasis on lifestyle and social change. Structured activities included an action project and several discussions, including a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayan village. Students also had flexibility in helping decide the program schedule when it did not interfere with the plans for structured activities. <p> The two programs also differed in ways that were expected, but not planned, such as in group size, ages of students, individual personalities, and teacher experience. Method <p> The program was evaluated through qualitative research methods that use the perspective of the participants to assess the social climate in an educational setting( Cantrell, 1993 ; Erickson, 1986). I based the research in part on models of teacher research( Cochran-Smith &; Lytle, 1993) and action research( Kemmis &; McTaggart, 1982 ; McKernan, 1991 ; Nixon, 1987 ; Robottom, 1985) that outline steps for onsite, systematic research by practitioners who are directly involved in the educational setting. This type of research is formative rather than summative, with a focus on the improvement of the curriculum and methods and not a final judgment on their worth. Data were collected before, during, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviews, and ancillary sources. These are described more fully below.( For a more detailed report of the collection and analysis of the data, see Emmons, 1994.) Participant Observation <p> Participant observation facilitated the collection of extensive data. While the program was carried out, most of the activities were recorded on audiotape and, in some cases, videotape. The data were later transcribed and generally contained conversations between the students and the teacher. Although participant observation methods generally include field notes, the researcher and the assistant in this study were full participants. They had to perform duties as teachers and leaders and were not always able to write, although they occasionally recorded notes on a tape recorder. McKernan 's( 1991) description of episode analysis was particularly helpful as discourse and events were broken down into smaller episodes that allowed an examination of the relationships between phenomena. The data provided a picture of what occurred during the environmental education program and also revealed how the teacher and students interacted with one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for examining similarities and differences within the teaching and learning processes of the two groups. Questionnaires <p> The purpose of the questionnaire was to provide preprogram and postprogram data to help determine where students exhibited growth or change. Both groups of students received the same questionnaire, and preprogram written questionnaires were administered to both groups at a preparation meeting. The postprogram questionnaires were the same as the preprogram questionnaires and were administered shortly before students left the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary. On both questionnaires, students selected from several preset responses, although some students wrote in their own responses or provided written clarification. Data from the questionnaires were then counted and compared with related data. <p> Group discussions followed the postprogram questionnaires and proved useful. Students in both groups had the opportunity to clarify, elaborate, and correct their responses. Students discussed the items in a hypothetical manner and also provided examples from their own experiences. These discussions were audiotaped and later transcribed for analysis. Questionnaire items that were particularly informative in terms of both discussion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to walk in the forest at night. <p> I would like to have a tiger( jaguar) skin in my house for <p> decoration. <p> If I saw a snake in my yard it would be best to have someone kill it. <p> The zoo is the best place for wild animals to live. Interviews <p> All participants were interviewed individually on the first and last days of the Cockscomb visit. Interviews provided data to help determine where students exhibited growth or change. The interviews were semistructured and allowed open-ended responses on the following preset questions : What is the purpose of the sanctuary? What would happen to this area if the trees were cut and citrus was planted? If a friend tells you he shot a tiger( jaguar) and used its skin for a decoration in his house, what would you tell him? If you were given the skin as a present, would you accept it? Do you think it would affect you in any way if there were no more forests in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species, and other environmental problems? What is something you could do about environmental problems? <p> Some of the interview questions were also discussed later with the entire group during the postprogram discussion. In the analysis of interview data, recurring themes across responses were noted and meaningful categories drawn( McKernan, 1991 ; Spradley, 1979). Interview data were also compared and contrasted with data from other sources. Ancillary Data <p> Student work was collected, including rough drafts and final products of projects, letters, and entries in the Cockscomb visitor 's log. The action project outcomes of both groups were particularly important data sources. Program logs and schedules were collected as a record of what kinds of activities took place and approximately how much time was spent on each. A variety of other recorded material was also collected. In place of written journals and written field notes, notes were recorded daily on audiotape by the teacher. These notes were supplemented by teacher self-interviews and discussions between the teacher and assistant. These data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and allowed the teacher and assistant to voice their perceptions and concerns. <p> The data were examined for answers to a series of questions, which in their most general form were the following : In what kinds of activities did participants engage, and what kinds of educational( and recreational) opportunities did these activities provide? What kinds of teaching methods and procedures were employed in these activities? What factors supported or constrained teaching and learning processes? What outcomes and patterns of change were apparent? <p> These questions were employed to guide the process of data analysis to obtain an accurate view of the teaching and learning situations. The Action Project <p> One of the most important activities for both groups was the development of an action project. The project served as a confluence of learning opportunities, but was also helpful in the evaluation of the program. The project provided much of the information for the revision of the positive environmental action model. The voluntary aspect of the project was important. Students were not required to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group to select an alternative activity. As an optional activity, the project served as a test of students ' motivation and demonstrated whether the program as a whole could inspire students to become more than just passive recipients of an environmental education program. <p> After listening to an introduction by the teacher, students decided as a group whether or not to proceed with the project, and students in both groups decided to do so. The students were helped initially by a discussion of project options that could be realistically completed during the 5-day program. They then chose, planned, and completed projects, combining their knowledge, feelings, and creative abilities to inform others about some of what they had learned. Students needed guidance and instruction in action skills and procedures, particularly in making initial decisions and plans. The second group, at the end of the project, also needed help with editing. <p> The first group of students produced a simple but sincere information poster for visitors : Take a Look!! <p> Welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Cockscomb is an enjoyable sanctuary. In order for it to stay that way, we should protect animals and trees. Please be careful NOT to pollute the area. The sanctuary has many fascinating places to visit, such as the river, trail tracks, water fall. You can take a look at the Victoria Peak, walk through the forest and do some bird watching. <p> Note : To visitors we should all stand and help to preserve the sanctuary by giving a little DONATION for its betterments sic. <p> The second group produced the article " What the Rainforest Means to Us, " which was later published in the Belize Audubon Society Newsletter. In their article, students discussed conservation and environmental problems, as well as characteristics and attractions of Cockscomb, and ended with a strong message : We Can Make a Difference! <p> Do you think the rainforest is here because it wanted to be here? No, everything that is here has its reason to be here, and we can not change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country should take more interest and be concerned about preserving the rainforest for the future. Our natural resources such as the forest, all the animals and the plants are important to us. We should be proud of what we have. We should stand up and say what is right about it ; and we will see our success in preserving the beauty of our land and country. <p> In addition, participants in the second group took another form of action entirely on their own when they invited a local environmental activist to speak at their school. This young man had previously spoken to the students at Cockscomb about environmental problems and about personal responsibility for taking action. Reflection and Revision : An Integrative and Interactive Model <p> The analysis of the learning opportunities and learning outcomes of the program suggests that the processes and outcomes of the program fit the model of positive environmental action. Both groups of students participated in and completed action projects as part of a program that also focused on an integration of learning in several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also revealed its weaknesses. Although the model seemed to work, some of the outcomes did not appear to be significant as positive environmental action. The question remained as to whether the students would continue to seek out opportunities for action after the end of the program. There was no guarantee that long-term environmental participation would ensue. Moreover, the model did not seem to illustrate adequately the intentional and independent action of Group 2 students when they invited the activist to speak at their school, an action that occurred outside the boundaries of the program. The new information showed that the original model of positive environmental action did not represent adequately the types of long-term actions that would qualify as part of Fien 's( 1993) education for the environment and its potential for contributing to social transformation. The critical reflection on the study and its results, as well as the questions raised by this reflection, eventually led to a rethinking of the original model and its methodology. The model was then revised to illustrate better the emerging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive environmental action( see Figure 2). <p> The outcomes of the second group of students in particular provided most of the new information for the model 's revision. For this reason, and as a result of space limitations, the illustration of the revised model contains only data from this group. The data serve to illustrate two important features of the revised model. One feature, the integration of the learning areas, was present in the original model, but could be illustrated in more detail with data from the program. The second feature, which is an interactive relationship between learning and action, was added after the analysis of the data was complete. Integrated Learning Areas <p> The revised model of positive environmental action shows that the learning areas interact to create a complex learning system. Program activities provided opportunities for integrated learning( see Table 1). For example, during the night walk activity, students were able to examine and discuss interesting elements of nature( see Figure 3). The night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they could later use in the action project. Instruction in action skills and procedures helped students with the planning and decisions needed for writing the article. Without the project, students may not have had the opportunity for translating an activity like the night walk into verbal form. Interactive Relationship <p> The interactive relationship between environmental education learning areas and positive environmental action is an important feature of the revised model. There is a circularity or reciprocity to this relationship, with the suggestion that students grow and learn as they carry out an action. This interactive relationship may take place entirely within the field setting, or it may begin there and continue in other settings. <p> Data from the action project reflect learning in both the processes and outcomes of the activity. Thus, students ' participation in their project not only resulted in an action outcome, but also appeared to contribute directly to further learning. Data collected through participant observation suggest that the students were learning or refining action skills and procedures, such as planning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( see Table 2). In their reflections on their completed work, students demonstrated realistic perspectives about what their article could actually achieve. They suggested, for example, that the article might help other students in their research. Each student 's contribution to the article reflected what she had learned during the program, and group cooperation resulted in the article 's completion. <p> An important aspect of the second program occurred when students took action entirely on their own by inviting an environmentalist to speak at their school and by asking their principal for permission. This action suggested that students had learned action skills and procedures( such as planning and cooperation) and had gained empowerment and ownership( such as personal responsibility). Their action also took place outside the field setting, indicating that students made use of continued opportunities even after the program ended. The action might have been inspired by the program, but it was not directed by the instruction or bounded by program limits( see Table 3). However, given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place outside of the field setting, some of the processes and outcomes remain speculative. Conclusion <p> The revised model of positive environmental action more adequately represents the continuous and dynamic processes that are believed possible when people in a particular social situation establish goals and procedures for their own actions. The participants within the setting begin to actively influence the processes of their growth and change, even when they may be encouraged initially by an environmental education program or some other event. When students are inspired to take action, follow-up activities that allow for continued cycles of growth and action appear to be important. Ideally, individuals and groups involved in environmental action make use of opportunities to reflect on and evaluate their initial action. They examine their growth and learning from past actions while they plan new ones. In this way, positive environmental action is a formative process as much as a final goal. At any point, the action goal may be achieved, hut the goals can adapt and grow as new information and skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutually created and changed by participants within their social situation. <p> Future ideas and information may provide additional material for revision of the positive environmental action model. The next step is to better document the relationships between learning and action, particularly continued cycles of action within and beyond the field setting. More case studies could reveal how environmental education programs involve students in positive environmental action. More important, such studies might serve to examine the greater issue of how participation in environmental education may bring about meaningful and long-term social transformation.
