4003041 Taiwan 's diplomatic stand in the global community has faced challenges since 1971, when it lost its UN seat to the PRC( People 's Republic of China). More and more countries shifted their official recognition from Taipei to Beijing, and fewer and fewer international organizations accepted Taiwan 's membership. By 1988, countries having diplomatic ties with Taiwan numbered only twenty-two, the majority of them insignificant players in the international arena. Moreover, not all of them had full-fledged diplomatic missions in Taiwan. Although Taiwan 's total world trade volume went from $3.9 billion in 1971 to $39.5 billion in 1980, fifty countries severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan during the same period. In 1989, only 5 percent of Taiwan 's trade was with countries that officially recognized Taiwan. 1 Its official membership in international organizations in 1988 had declined to only eight international bodies. 2 These developments cast doubt on Taiwan 's continuing viability as an independent political entity. In order to break out of its diplomatic isolation, Taiwan has employed its economic strength to gain friendship, not only deepening interactions with friendly countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has beefed up this effort has been through the use of foreign aid. <p> This article focuses on Taiwan 's foreign aid policy since the late 1980s by examining the extent of its success and failure and investigating its scope, durability, and implications. How and where is this foreign aid delivered? What is the limitation of this " dollar diplomacy, " as some Taiwanese politicians call it? Is it designed to allay suffering and promote development in needy nations, or is it intended instead to serve the interests of the donor? The findings will shed light not only on the utility of foreign aid in Taiwan 's diplomacy but also on Taiwan 's future status in the international community. <p> Information on Taiwan 's foreign aid has not been systematically documented and placed in the public domain. The government in Taiwan considers these statistical data and documentary sources to be sensitive and confidential and only discloses information selectively. This makes exhaustive evaluation impossible, but an examination of the available materials offers enough hints for us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aid : Design and Implementation <p> There is no consensus regarding the definition of foreign aid. Some view it as including any flow of materials and financial resources, including grants, loan packages for which the interest is below the market rate, noncompensatory technical assistance, officially guaranteed credits, and reparation pay. Others regard foreign aid as only the transfer of resources on terms easier than those that could be obtained in the capital market. 3 Notwithstanding these various definitions, it is usually considered to be a transfer from the haves to the have-nots for the purpose of economic development, military security, and disaster relief and rehabilitation. <p> At one time or another, most industrialized countries have been donors of aid. The implementation of the Marshall Plan and the wooing of third world countries by foreign aid since the 1950s occurred within the context of the East-West confrontation. Likewise, in the 1950s and 1960s, the competition between mainland China and Taiwan for international recognition also led each of them to offer extensive foreign aid to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid was not only to isolate and diminish Taiwan 's international standing but also to pose as a third choice for developing countries by claiming a noble purpose of offering genuine help, unlike the exploitative intention of both the American capitalist imperialist and the Soviet socialist revisionist. 4 For Taiwan, the purpose of foreign aid was not to bid for a leadership role but to focus on survival by winning friendship and support for its legitimacy as an acceptable actor in world politics, particularly to ensure its UN seat. 5 By the 1970s, however, Taiwan was engaged in a losing battle with Beijing for diplomatic recognition as the legitimate government of the whole China. 6 <p> Most of the financing of Taiwan 's foreign aid programs before the late 1960s came from American surplus agricultural products sold in Taiwan. Even though the idea of aiding other developing countries was partially initiated by Taiwan, the money then was mostly from the United States. 7 The objective was to demonstrate Taiwan 's experience and was aimed at self-sufficiency, but the emphasis was on simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field. By 1980, over two thousand technicians from Taiwan had served in some fifty different countries, mostly African and Latin American countries having diplomatic ties with Taiwan. In contrast, because of its great financial resources and economic clout, Taiwan 's foreign aid program since the late 1980s has been more extensive than this early grass-roots approach. Technical and agricultural assistance projects are still part of aid projects, but financial loans, grants, and contributions to multilateral organizations have been added to the list of provisions. Although Taiwan 's foreign affairs have been less influenced than before by the United States after the latter withdrew its recognition in 1979, its foreign aid policy indicates the trend of its increasing autonomy. Taiwan no longer needs to rely on U.S. financing to launch its aid efforts. <p> Taiwan 's foreign aid program rests in the decision-making process of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs( MOFA) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs( MOEA). Two implementing arms are the Committee of International Technical Cooperation( CITC) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The CITC was initially known as Operation Vanguard, established in 1961 to provide agricultural technical assistance to African and Latin American countries. The IECDF was created in 1988 with a five-year goal of allocating $1.2 billion in aid to friendly developing countries. Although the IECDF was set up by the MOEA and the official who is in charge of daily administration is the political vice-minister of the MOEA, the IECDF is ultimately steered by a seven-member cabinet-level council with representatives from various agencies. 8 Additional agencies and departments are called in whenever help is needed. For example, when the project involves agricultural assistance, the Taiwan provincial government 's Department of Agriculture and Forestry is consulted. When the aid is concerned with extending credit to foreign governments and the financing of outward investment, the Export-Import Bank( Eximbank), a specialized government bank established in 1979, is brought into the implementation process. 9 <p> Although the assumption is that both the MOFA and the MOEA hold joint jurisdiction over decision making, each ministry sees aid from a somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic viewpoint, examining aid proposals carefully in order to ensure efficient and effective use of money. Without denying the necessity of wise planning of aid for the commercial interest and development needs of recipients, the MOFA is more concerned with aid as a diplomatic lever. Aid programs are sometimes employed as expedient political means to win diplomatic favors. The MOEA prefers a detailed and careful screening process, which might take more than a year ; the MOFA tends to favor a shorter period of deliberation for approval in order to take advantage of changing international circumstances or to sustain relationships with countries deemed " politically correct " and important to Taiwan. Most recipients of the MOFA 's aid are friendly countries, meaning that they either have recognized Taiwan or that they are willing to construct substantial relations without fear of Beijing 's reprisals. <p> In the 1991 fiscal year, the allocation for the IECDF was $48 million, and the CITC received $32 million. The MOFA budgeted $188 million for international activities, partly to be used for external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the MOFA 's budget was completely dedicated to external aid and that this funding was used in its entirety, the total of the IECDF, CITC, and MOFA portions -- $268 million in all -- would account for 0.16 percent of Taiwan 's gross national product( GNP). 10 Although it can not be determined if the scheduled budget has been spent completely due to the political sensitivity of some aid programs, and although it is clear that not every penny of the MOFA 's international budget was spent on external aid, a conservative estimate of Taiwan 's 1991 foreign aid spending would be about 0.1 percent of the GNP, less than that of the United States( 0.15 percent) in 1989. Even so, in total dollars, Taiwan 's aid compares favorably with some OECD( Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) members such as Ireland and New Zealand and it is higher than that of most of the OPEC( Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) countries. 11 In the 1992 fiscal year, the budget allocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 Who Gets What <p> Taiwan 's foreign aid covers six geographic areas( Table 1). In Latin America, Taiwan promised $10 million aid to Grenada and $50 million aid to Belize for housing and hydraulic power plant projects in 1989. 13 The amount of aid for Costa Rica and Panama totaled $16.8 million dollars in 1989-90. 14 In August 1991, Taiwan 's vice-president made a highly publicized official visit to Costa Rica, Honduras, and Nicaragua, despite charges from the Taiwanese opposition party of buying friendship with aid pledges of millions of dollars to these countries. 15 <p> The arm of aid has also reached Africa, a target of Taiwan 's aid program since the 1960s, when Taiwan was competing with the PRC for UN membership and recognition. In the 1980s, Taiwan focused on regaining recognition from some previously friendly countries. Liberia received fifteen thousand tons of rice in 1988-89 to relieve its food shortage crises and then $212 million to cover road construction and educational improvement after its decision to normalize relations with Taiwan in 1989. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. In 1991, Nigeria was offered a $38 million aid package. 16 South Africa also received a $60 million low-interest loan in 1991 to provide black people in South Africa with technical and agricultural assistance. 17 <p> In 1989, Papua New Guinea, a country in the Southern Pacific without official ties with Taiwan, agreed to exchange trade missions with Taiwan. This accord was reached after Taiwan 's pledge of $17.65 million in aid and occurred amid Beijing 's protests. 18 The year 1991 witnessed additional aid to Papua New Guinea as well as $710,000 to the Solomon Islands, which recognize Taiwan as a nation. <p> Delegations from Southeast Asia are likewise beating a path to Taipei for aid. Southeast Asia has been the top priority of Taiwan 's foreign aid programs because of its geographical closeness and recent economic vitality. In 1991, for example, Indonesia and Thailand each received $1.7 million in aid to further so-called " substantive " relations. 19 The Taiwanese government has also begun to evaluate the possibility of a $15 million loan to Vietnam( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance to a proposed highway construction project in Vietnam. 20 <p> The latest aid effort in Taiwan 's " flexible diplomacy " is in the Baltic states and other republics of the defunct Soviet Union. The lECDF has included these countries in its list of states eligible for assistance. 21 Though the Baltic states have established relations with the PRC to win China 's crucial vote regarding their UN membership applications, they appear to have a strong sense of affinity toward the thriving capitalist economy of Taiwan. It has become a pattern for newly independent countries to establish diplomatic relations with China first to gain UN seats and then to develop relations with Taiwan later. The possibility of economic assistance, something more tangible than an economic model, led to exchanges of legations or consulates between Taiwan and Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania. Ukraine also allowed the establishment of Taiwan 's trade representative office in Kiev with Taiwan 's promise of food assistance in return. Taiwan also focuses on technical assistance. For example, it has established a variety of training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developments have given Taiwan an " official presence " in these countries, accompanied by limited diplomatic privileges and immunities. 22 <p> In cases where direct assistance has been politically inappropriate, Taiwan has employed a multilateral approach to aid. In Southeast Asia, for example, the IECDF appropriated $15 million in 1992 to the Asian Development Equity Fund, which is supported by the Asian Development Bank. 23 In addition, a $150 million donation was pledged in 1991 to the Central American Bank for Economic Integration to help needy countries in that region in the early 1990s. As a result, the bank revised its charter to allow Taiwan to join in as a non-regional member in 1992. 24 Moreover, the South Pacific Forum, a regional organization of 15 member states in the South Pacific, admitted Taiwan to be the eighth Dialogue Partner in 1992 for its annual Post-Forum Dialogue in order to request economic assistance from Taipei. It is noteworthy that only four member states of the Forum recognize Taiwan( the other seven partners include the United States, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and the European Community). 25 <p> In dealing with cash-strained Eastern Europe, Taiwan has channeled aid through the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development by promising a $10 million contribution to a special fund to help develop market oriented economies. A huge portion of the $10 million subscription will be loans to help republics of former Soviet Union and East European countries ; 20 percent of it will be used to advise Taiwan 's investors in Europe and help make related purchases from Taiwan. As of June 1992, 90 percent of the fund had been used. 26 This gives Taiwan a link with an international financial organization, even though it is not qualified to join the bank because it is a non-European country and a non-IMF( International Monetary Fund) affiliate. In fiscal year 1992, Taiwan 's contribution to the three regional banks -- the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Asian Development Bank, and the Central American Bank -- totaled $32.5 million, accounting for 0.07 percent of the government 's budget. 27 <p> Taiwan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the international community. Amid the intensive pledge efforts to offset the costs of military operations in the Persian Gulf, Taiwan 's initial offer was about $100 million. Although it was not comparable to the amounts offered by Japan and Germany, Taiwan 's offer was larger than that of most other nations. For example, South Korea, which is larger in territorial size and population, responded with an offer of $50 million in cash and $70 million in goods and services over a two-year period. Even after the United States turned down Taiwan 's offer because of its concern with the PRC 's critical vote in the UN Security Council, Taiwan still pledged $30 million to the Middle Eastern countries hurt by the crisis. 28 All of this aid is on top of other humanitarian programs, for example, $20 million to Jordan to offset losses during the gulf crisis and $10 million to Kurdish refugees in Iraq. 29 <p> Several observations about Taiwan 's new aid efforts can be made. First, in all cases, Taiwan apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends " first break ties with China. Instead, Taiwan was willing to accept their dual recognition of both Chinas. Even if countries are not enthusiastic about the idea of diplomatic recognition, Taiwan is still willing to use aid to promote official contacts between countries. Accepting that some developing countries, particularly those in Southeast Asia, more or less realize China 's role and weight in their national security and regional stability, Taiwan 's expectation is not the acquisition of full-scale diplomatic ties but( at least) the establishment of official trade or representative offices under the name of " Taipei " or " Republic of China. " The mere existence of such an office helps Taiwan 's trade and investors in the host country. Moreover, official interaction signifies a breakthrough in diplomatic isolation, a beachhead for further development, and a change of international image. <p> Another example is Europe. Perhaps because of Taiwan 's recent aid programs, in combination with its trade and investment, European countries and the European Community have started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taiwan since 1991. Europe also accounts for 18 percent of Taiwan 's two-way trade in the early 1990s. 30 Reinharde Drifte once pointed out that in the early 1980s, Taiwan was considered only an object of trade and tourism, without any political leverage in East Asia or the international community. There seemed no way for Taiwan to circumvent its diplomatic isolation. 31 In the early 1990s, however, Taiwan 's image has undergone a significant change in Europe. <p> Second, aid and investment are apparently complementary to each other. In 1990, Sam Shieh, the president of Taiwan 's Central Bank, estimated that Taiwan 's total outward investment might reach twelve to fifteen billion dollars. 32 Aid furthers the expansion of Taiwan 's outward investment, as clearly seen in its interaction with Southeast Asia. Given its geographical closeness and cultural affinity, Southeast Asia catches Taiwan 's eyes. In 1989, Taiwan directly invested $1.96 billion, 11 percent more than in 1988, in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1986-1989 period was $4.1 billion, along with $15.9 billion in trade. 33 By 1991, Taiwan had become the largest foreign investor in Vietnam, injecting more than $400 million into the Vietnamese economy. Vietnam also agreed to allow Taiwan to set up a trade representative office to protect the interests and rights of Taiwanese investors there. 34 <p> Aid and investment walk side by side in Latin America, too. In 1988, the MOFA issued a special policy to encourage investment in this region. The program offers eligible projects a lower loan rate, a percentage of financing up to 80 percent of total investment, and an excellent deal in investment insurance. 35 Nevertheless, Latin America has remained a less attractive investment venue, from Taiwanese investors ' perspective, than Southeast Asia because of the latter 's cultural affinity and better work ethics. <p> Even so, experts from Taiwan provided managerial guidance for the establishment of export processing zones in Guatemala, Panama, and Costa Rica. For example, Taiwan paid most of the start-up costs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites and offering tax incentives. It is clear that this foreign aid was based as much on export need as on diplomacy : Taiwan was able to use these countries as duty-free launching pads to enter the U.S. market by taking the advantage of the U.S. Caribbean Basin Initiative, which began in 1983 to assist export earnings of twenty-eight Caribbean and Latin American countries by offering trade benefits in the U.S. market. 36 As U.S. resistance to East Asian exports has grown, the idea of lending a hand to the establishment of export processing zones certainly has benefited Taiwan 's trade. <p> Third, though Taiwan 's aid has concentrated on Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia, South Asia and the Middle East have been relatively neglected, partly because of the lack of regular dialogue and substantial trade relations between Taiwan and some countries in these regions, partly because of the volatile political situation in the Middle East. Another reason may be that certain oil-producing countries have accumulated more than sufficient petrodollars. Upon a recipient 's request, however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of technical and agricultural assistance. <p> Fourth, Taiwan is willing to adopt either the bilateral or multilateral approach to aid, as the situation requires. It seems to be to Taiwan 's advantage to engage in bilateral aid relations, which allow the recipient country to identify the donor more easily than in the case of multilateral aid packages. Such relations give Taiwan more discretionary power in negotiation as a donor and allow it to control the initiative. Even though no political strings are attached, indirect persuasion is at work. As long as give-and-take is established, Taiwan 's goal of " substantial diplomacy " has been partially fulfilled. <p> At times, the multilateral aid approach is employed, however, to reduce the political sensitivity incurred from bilateral aid. Moreover, when the organization in charge of the multilateral aid decides to accept Taiwan 's contribution, Taiwan sometimes acquires membership in order to participate in the management and governance of aid allocation. Even without such membership, the multilateral route establishes communication between Taiwan and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonding " capability, improves its chances of eventual membership in international organizations, and strengthens its claims as a de facto entity separate from the PRC. The Objectives of Taiwanese Aid <p> The political transition of 1986-1988 to a democratic regime, with the establishment of opposition parties and the lifting of martial law, freed Taiwan from its decades-long ideological stance of non-coexistence with the PRC. Though the principle of non-coexistence satisfied the self-justified sense of morality in rhetoric, it in effect entrapped Taiwan in a self-limiting situation without sufficient freedom to maneuver for creative diplomacy. The gradual thaw in domestic politics has been reflected in external relations. Pragmatism seems to be taking the lead in Taiwan 's foreign policy, and foreign aid seems to be an indispensable and effective tool to achieve one of its top foreign policy objectives : to win more international support, preferably official recognition, for Taiwan 's existence as an independent political entity and Taiwan 's participation in international organizations, thus warding off diplomatic isolation and deterring the PRC from taking drastic measures against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some mini-states with which Taiwan has no extensive trade or investment relationship at all. <p> This objective certainly can not be easily achieved. The PRC has consistently argued that Taiwan 's foreign aid policy is " silver-bullet diplomacy " to cloak its intention of establishing a " two Chinas " or " one China and one Taiwan " policy, resulting in the " creeping officiality " of Taiwan 's international status. 37 The PRC still has influence in blocking Taiwan 's aid offensive. For instance, Taiwan was excluded from a two-day conference in Tokyo in May 1992 that aimed at providing economic aid to Mongolia, at which seventeen countries and five international organizations participated. 38 After receiving $2 million in aid from Taiwan during the gulf crisis, Turkey turned down a further $3 million because of Beijing 's protest. Egypt also rejected a $5 million aid offer from Taiwan. 39 Partly because of the changing Middle East situation, and partly because of the reliance on the PRC for missile supplies and satellite launching, Saudi Arabia finally agreed to establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly concerned with security, Taiwan 's money-oriented aid packages still have difficulty in competing with the PRC 's offer of arms. In order to head off further diplomatic setbacks such as those created by Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and Singapore when they recognized the PRC in 1991 and South Korea in 1992, Taiwan has pushed for more aid offensives in the developing countries. <p> Aid supporters, however, claim that aid is not strictly for political purpose. The need to maintain vigorous external economic relations for Taiwan 's sustained growth becomes another top priority. Aid paves the way for increasing Taiwan 's outward investment and acts as leverage to enable its investors to enjoy better treatment in recipient countries. " Aid constituency " in Taiwan apparently includes business groups who see foreign aid as one way to increase trade sales and investment opportunities. The commercial nature of Taiwan 's aid stimulates trade between donor and recipient and indirectly leads to more earnings because of viable trade cash flows. <p> Aid also creates relocation options so that Taiwan 's manufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainland China. Taiwan 's total investments in China reached well over $5 billion in 1991, 41 but the Taiwanese government has long warned that the PRC intends to entrap Taiwanese enterprises and investment in China 's market and production in order to create irremediable dependency for future political blackmail. Dependence on the mainland has also pulled Taiwan into disputes that are not its own making. The United States has constantly threatened economic retaliation against the PRC for its unfair trade practices, lack of human rights protection, and violations of intellectual and property rights. Through its investments in mainland China, Taiwan is indirectly entangled in these disputes. A variety of aid packages in Southeast Asia gives Taiwanese business and industry the option of switching from the mainland to enjoy similar benefits of low labor costs and extensive investment advantages elsewhere. <p> Moreover, overseas investment eases pressures from the appreciation of Taiwan 's currency, labor shortages and wage increases, the growing demand for environmental protection, excessive foreign exchange reserves, and trade imbalances with other countries. Outward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bypass quota restriction in the fenced markets of major trading partners such as the United States. 42 Aid serves the role of lubricant to smooth relations between host countries and investors and makes it easier for Taiwan 's companies to put down roots without stirring up any existing racial resentment against ethnic Chinese and outside Chinese investors in local economies, especially in Southeast Asia. Taiwan 's investment is therefore seen to be of little threat to the local government and societies. Thus, an " underlying rationally " concerning Taiwan 's trade and investment opportunities pushes forward the foreign aid programs. <p> In addition to the two top priorities of a solid international standing and trade and investment promotion, other objectives have been discussed, but they have received relatively lower priority and less attention. One is to address the need to help the less developed countries( LDC), an idea that gained momentum in domestic political dialogues in the 1980s. The government claimed that Taiwan 's aid is considered not only an answer to the call for " burden sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economic power shift to the Pacific. U.S. aid to Taiwan from 1949 to 1965 partially contributed to Taiwan 's political stability and economic prosperity. Now it can be said that it is time for Taiwan to pay back its due. Moreover, using the words of Taiwan 's foreign minister, Taiwan becomes " a potentially valuable contributor to the emerging new world order " by helping others. 43 Although countries still resist the idea of recognizing Taiwan, aid provides Taiwan with some room for diplomatic give-and-take in the international community. " Being there " in the international aid regime at least cultivates a positive image of Taiwan as a burden sharer, not a free rider. Therefore, the U.S. Brady Plan intending to reduce the LDC debt problem in 1989 initially received a positive, enthusiastic response from Taiwan. No doubt the government 's enthusiasm for the Brady Plan is more or less related to image maintenance for the sake of downplaying Taiwan 's trade surplus in recent years. No one can deny, however, that Taiwan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerations of inequality between states. This concern serves as one legitimate reason for policy initiation and reinforces the justification for Taiwan 's continuing aid efforts. 44 <p> Another objective of aid is to enhance national pride. Taiwan 's rush toward advanced economic status has dazzled outsiders. The bestowing of foreign aid fosters a sense of pride because it indicates that Taiwan is capable of assisting others. The hidden implication behind such aid is that the government policies guided by the Nationalist party must have been correct all along in the past because they achieved such remarkable economic prosperity, which in turn has allowed Taiwan to offer help to others. The impact of foreign aid affects domestic politics in that it reinforces regime legitimacy and stability. The Effectiveness of Aid : Criticism at Home <p> Taiwan 's foreign aid program has not been implemented without controversy. At at time when people in Taiwan have been increasingly demanding extensive social and public services and an upgraded economic infrastructure for further economic development, they have been questioning the government 's priorities regarding domestic needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn the government back to the domestic needs and has somewhat restrained Taiwan 's external aid offensive to avoid internal criticism. For opponents of foreign aid, the first beneficiary of any " free lunch " should be the people of Taiwan. <p> Critics are particularly rankled by the Brady Plan. Several advanced industrialized states, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund are all involved in the multifaceted projects of the Brady Plan to relieve the third world debt. Although Taiwan received a tacit invitation to participate in this project, critics of foreign aid maintain that Taiwan has no obligation to join because it is no longer a member of these international organizations and has no diplomatic relations with participating industrialized countries. They add that the United States would use Taiwan 's contribution to promote its own philanthropic image and that Taiwan would remain anonymous. Pointing to the lukewarm response of the United States to Taiwan 's application for the GATT( General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) in 1989, these critics argue that it seems pointless to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge donation to a charity dinner without even receiving a ticket to attend the event. <p> Moreover, critics argue, most aid recipients are developing countries, hardly serious players in the world arena. Spending millions of dollars in aid in exchange for symbolic recognition does not seem to be a smart bargain. After all, Taiwan has been isolated for so long that to add a few more countries to the list of diplomatic recognition hardly improves the situation. <p> The pro-Taiwan independence groups, particularly those inside the opposition party( the Democratic Progressive party), consider this " dollar diplomacy " a waste of Taiwan 's hard-earned foreign currency reserves and a tool to stall the natural course of Taiwan independence. In their view, the governing party, the KMT( Nationalist party), tries to use foreign aid to sustain its claim of the " Republic of China. " They argue that the basic strategy for a diplomatic breakthrough is to claim Taiwan 's independent identity first. Only then can foreign aid be truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, instead of using aid as a bargaining chip to purchase or to cling to a national title that has lost appeal to the international community. 46 <p> Opponents also raise the issue of the effectiveness of foreign aid. Although it is considered to be an excellent chance to participate in the international community, it has raised doubts about the worth of putting money into the deep, dark hole of third world countries. If advanced countries such as the United States and Japan have not been able to solve those thorny problems of debt and economic under development in the third world, how can one expect tiny Taiwan to achieve it? There is evidence that foreign aid has done little to promote economic development in recipient countries. A typical case is Liberia, where two decades of foreign aid seem to have made little contribution to its economic development and agricultural production. 47 <p> Liberia is also an example of the two-China diplomatic tango : Liberia accepted help from Taiwan and mainland China, switching sides in 1977 and again in 1989. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomatic relations with Taiwan twice in 1962 and 1968 but switched recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1964 and 1976. 48 The establishment of diplomatic ties is built upon monetary assistance, but there is no guarantee that countries will not switch sides easily once the well of the aid package dries up. There is ample reason to question the use of foreign aid as a way to win international popularity. <p> In order to placate opponents ' criticism, much of Taiwan 's aid has been given on a request and application basis, which allows careful screening of the appropriateness of aid projects. This screening probably explains why so far the government in Taiwan has been slow to approve grants from the recently established IECDF. Until the end of 1991, the government had budgeted $400 million for the fund, but only $114 million( 28.5 percent) had been delivered to twelve countries. Only seventeen out of eighty-three formal applications for IECDF assistance had been approved by 1991, although twenty were still under evaluation. 49 Most applications have been from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of industrial parks or export processing zones in which Taiwan 's industrial investors can benefit. 50 The Effectiveness of Aid : Donor Interest vs. Recipient Need <p> In order to assess the utility and limitation of Taiwan 's aid, it is necessary to examine whether Taiwan 's foreign aid policy follows the recipient need approach or the donor interest approach. 51 The former allocates aid in proportion to the recipient 's needs, whereas the latter employs aid programs to promote the interests of the donor. The bargaining position of the donor is strengthened during the aid relationship because the donor is able to terminate aid at its option. <p> Because access to government information is limited, no systematic relationship between aid and development can be established to substantiate the recipient need approach. Nevertheless, a variety of Taiwan 's aid programs do allow recipients to improve agricultural production, meet immediate socio-economic needs, and supplement the capital accumulation process. 52 On the other hand, it is undeniable that there is a hidden agenda behind Taiwan 's decisions. As the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right thing to help countries in need, and what 's wrong with getting some political benefit? " 53 In fact, it seems naive to assume that most foreign aid efforts stem from purely humanitarian motives. Political expediency rides along with the aid programs. <p> Moreover, aid creates a reciprocal situation of commitment and reliance between Taiwan and aid recipients. Taiwan relies on the recipients, at least to facilitate investment, trade, and travel for the Taiwanese people, and at most to support its bid for membership in international organizations such as GATT and to help it gain diplomatic recognition. Aid from Taiwan is used as a carrot to reward countries pursuing policies favorable to Taiwan. <p> Aid efforts, nevertheless, are no guarantee of recognition or diplomatic ties. Taiwan 's bargaining advantage is unlikely to increase tremendously after the aid program begins, in part because the recipients see the PRC, a competing donor with Taiwan, waiting outside the door to strike a deal. A recent case is Niger : in 1992 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Taipei 's promise of loans but faced diplomatic pressures as well as a significant aid counter-offer from Beijing. 54 This means that Taiwan may not be able to exact whatever it wishes from the recipient. The existence of the PRC lessens the likelihood of a recipient 's dependency on Taiwan as a donor. 55 Therefore, the argument that the donor 's bargaining position will be reinforced during the aid relationship is limited in Taiwan 's case. <p> This should not lead one to conclude that Taiwan suffers severely from the " reversed dependence " incurred by the aid relationship. Although Taiwan seems desperate to welcome any kind of official linkage, it is unreasonable to believe that Taiwan would fulfill every recipient 's demand. The proliferation of states and the demise of ideological confrontation in the post-cold war era have given Taiwan more access to various channels to improve its international status. One country 's decision to switch sides will not cause great damage. Taiwan has become used to external denials of its status in the international community. The threat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to yield to a recipient 's wishes. Because money talks louder than politics to cash-hunting developing countries, aid donors still have some leverage. Though " reversed dependence " indeed exists, it is hard to imagine that Taiwan would reduce its autonomous position to a significant extent to fulfill any recipient 's demand. <p> Many recipients in fact view Taiwan 's foreign aid as less threatening than aid from other industrialized countries, which usually generates charges of a sellout to imperialism or foreign intervention. Unlike other countries, Taiwan has never explicitly mentioned human rights improvement in the recipient 's society as a contingency for aid. Other than its requests for diplomatic support, trade convenience, and investment benefits, Taiwan offers aid that allows a large degree of freedom for deliberation. In particular, Taiwan 's status as a newly industrialized economy, a country only recently advanced from a developing condition, more or less relieves a recipient 's concern with foreign exploitation. That is, Taiwan 's aid is perceived less as a malignant intention to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societies, as world system approach or dependency approach scholars would proclaim, than as a coherent burst of pragmatism in Taiwan 's diplomatic approach. Aid therefore occurs when both donors and recipients see the convergence of national interests and willingness to accommodate each other. The modification of Taiwan 's stand on coexistence with the PRC in international affairs and the material incentives Taiwan offers give recipient countries a reasonable possibility of accepting the deal. The objectives of recipients and donors can be quite diverse yet complementary. <p> The twin crises of foreign debt combined with the lack of real substantial economic growth in the third world have apparently made Taiwan 's offers very tempting. So far, several countries have taken advantage of Taiwan 's economic aid and established official ties with Taiwan. Even though these nations are just " little friends, " the numbers game remains significant to Taiwan. In comparison with the more than 140 countries that have official ties with the PRC, thirty countries in total recognized Taiwan in 1992, an increase from twenty-two countries in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspension of relations with these countries, a step short of severing relations completely. 56 Conclusions <p> In comparison with other industrialized countries, the total dollar amount of Taiwan 's aid looks small, yet it provides Taiwan with an image of " non-free-rider, " a nation willing to participate in international affairs and ready to offer help whenever needed. Through this image-building process, Taiwan may be able to participate in international organizations such as( GATT, IMF, World Bank, or even the United Nations. Taiwan is learning from the experience of Japan and Germany : both emerged from isolation at the end of World War II into full participation in international politics. <p> Taiwan 's diplomacy, long steeped in straight anti-communist policy, has grown more flexible. Today it has been seen less in terms of a Manichaear struggle between the forces of right and the forces of wrong. Foreign aid is good example of this new tendency. Taiwan 's diplomacy is not strongly affected by a recipient country 's ideological leanings. <p> Taiwan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have accepted this aid and improved their relations with Taiwan. Even if countries are reluctant to endorse Taiwan 's official identity separate from the PRC, the sheer existence of aid programs still serves the function of diplomatic linkage. And even if a recipient country establishes official ties with Beijing, Taiwan 's aid has continued if desired by the recipient, as is shown in the example of Senegal. 57 <p> Taiwan 's foreign aid helps convince industrialized countries, moreover, of its contribution to the international community and willingness to cooperate with the others in international affairs. Undoubtedly, decisions of developed countries to accept Taiwan back into the community in full scale also depend on the PRC 's tolerance of Taiwan 's effort to project itself as an independent political entity and whether the rest of the world is responding to the PRC 's pressure. <p> With the emergence of " donation fatigue " in most industrialized countries and the subsidence of ideological competition in the post-cold war era, Taiwan 's entrance into the club of donors is welcomed. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy comes not so much from recipients but from criticisms of powerful opposition groups and suspicious constituencies within Taiwan. In order to diffuse criticism for its " black box "( secret) operations and the ambiguous delimitation of authority between governmental departments in the decision-making process, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Taiwan has started to draft a law to restructure all aid deliberation as well as implementation under an umbrella body. It would also make aid subject to parliamentary approval. 58 This would avoid the mixture of policy voices and make aid more accountable to the legislative discretion. Nevertheless, the question of whether Taiwan 's international status will be greatly improved due to this restructuring of its aid policy still remains to be answered in the coming decade.
