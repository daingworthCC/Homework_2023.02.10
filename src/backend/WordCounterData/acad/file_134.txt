4018941 A modern chef takes on the challenge of ancient cooking <p> LIKE MANY AMERICANS THESE DAYS, I fancy myself a fairly adventurous cook. And I 've produced some( overly) ambitious stuff in my cramped kitchen, like quail in rose-petal sauce and chicken livers and eggs in aspic. So when ARCHAEOLOGY asked me to fix up some ancient menus, I figured, no problem. I 'll hit up the Greeks and the Romans and that will be that. But I had no idea what I was getting into. Because it turns out Apicius is n't the unchallenged king of the ancient culinary world, after all. <p> Many hungry ARCHAEOLOGY readers are no doubt already familiar with Apicius, the first-century A.D. Roman gourmand and chef who wrote copiously on elaborate food preparation and presentation, leaving us with an invaluable insight into the culinary mores of his contemporaries.( And who can forget his recipe for stuffed dormice?) Apicius is widely acknowledged as the first cookbook writer, but why should Romans have all the fun? <p> Why not give the Mongolian Empire 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court physician can be credited with showing us what in Xanadu did Kublai Khan dine on while decreeing his stately pleasure dome. In 1330, Hu presented the Mongol emperor Wenzong, the great-grandson of Kublai Khan, with an enormous dietary manual, Proper and Essential Things for the Emperor 's Food and Drink, containing more than 200 recipes, and much advice concerning the medicinal values and health dangers of foods.( The full translation of this book, along with extensive commentary and the complete original text, can be found in A Soup for the Qan, by Paul Buell and Eugene Anderson.) In his dishes, from lamb-stuffed eggplant, with basil-garlic yogurt sauce to deep-fried fish cakes flavored with mandarin orange and the bitter spice asafoetida, he was creatively combining flavors from the wide sphere of Mongolian influence, from Baghdad to Beijing, centuries before the words " fusion " and " cuisine " were ever used in the same sentence. <p> Or what about the nameless cooks who scribbled down their tips in cuneiform in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became all the rage in today 's chic bistros, chefs in the cradle of civilization were, if the clues they left on clay tablets are to be believed, dismembering tiny game birds, roasting the legs, and braising the bodies before carefully reassembling them atop a round of flatbread and garnishing them with watercress. <p> The Maya were not lacking for culinary achievements either, as we know thanks to European observers, archaeological evidence from trash heaps, and a direct culinary heritage that can be traced forward to many of today 's Latin American cooking traditions. They made good use of the many foodstuffs native to the New World, such as tomatoes, maize, turkey, and chile peppers, to create a complex and flavorful cuisine, and the tamales and salsas( not to mention chocolate!) they invented today grace tables the world over. <p> Long before superstar chefs started experimenting with trout ice cream or tomato foam, adventurous foodies from Mongolia to Mesopotamia to Mayapn were paving the way. I decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-create some of their most appealing dishes for a group of brave guests. <p> THE FIRST DIFFICULTY a twenty-first-century home cook runs into when attempting to explore cuisines hundreds or thousands of years old is in establishing the ground rules. Does one make use of refrigeration?( The answer, after a brief but definitive analysis of logistics : an emphatic yes.) What about mutton, one of the most common meats throughout the Old World but now almost impossible for the common consumer to obtain in this country? Would I be cheating if I settled for lamb?( In America today, sheep are slaughtered almost exclusively before the end of their first year, making them technically lamb. Anything older is very, very tough -- to buy, I mean, although I presume it also presents a challenge to the incisors.) And what about all those archaic food-preparation methods? I possess neither a horse under whose saddle I can shove meat for tenderizing, as the Mongols did, nor a yard into which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And then there are the Sumerian recipes that call for blood. Is it safe to cook with blood? Is it even legal? <p> Mesopotamians were not the only ones to use blood in their cooking, and they were most likely not the first, either. Blood, after all, is full of iron and protein ; it 's also tasty, with a meaty flavor not unlike liver. And when added to a dish with some liquid in it, say turnips braised in broth, the blood acts as a thickener much like flour or cornstarch, only more so( and with a more disturbing color), creating a thick, dark brown sauce. This binding quality made blood valuable to early cooks trying to raise the bar on their culinary endeavors. The cooks of the Mongol court disregarded the religious taboos of some of the empire 's subjects when they used sheep 's blood as a binding agent in noodles, both to add nutritive value and to make the dough easier to handle. To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood to bind the fillings for their blood sausages. <p> Which is why it 's a little surprising to me that everyone I tried to buy the stuff from thought I was a Satan worshiper. <p> Whether I was talking to ethnic butchers in Queens or a gentlemen farmer selling his organic lamb chops and wool at a bustling, upscale green market in Manhattan, the tenor of a previously amicable conversation would change drastically upon mention of the word " blood. " Friendly, open faces would close up, turning wary, suspicious. The answer to my query was always some variation on, " Oh no, we do n't have that. " One sheep farmer said she could provide blood, but with a condition. " I 'll have to get you to sign a form indicating that the blood will not be used for human consumption. " <p> Not be used for human consumption? What exactly was I getting myself into here? <p> Finally, after weeks of failure, I walked into a Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to get the precious stuff -- a gallon jug of frozen beef 's blood, USDA approved if you can believe the cap. It was n't until I 'd paid 15 bucks -- the going rate for a gallon of cow blood, salinated to prevent coagulation-and was on my way out that the guy asked : " So what are you, a vampire or somethin '? " <p> Ingredients in Hu 's book posed different sorts of challenges. The carp for his fried fish cakes, for instance, is just an overgrown goldfish, which hardly anyone eats anymore. I found mine -- and had it executed by bludgeoning -- at a fish monger 's stall deep in Chinatown. Then I carried the creature 's butchered remains with me uptown a dozen or so blocks to an Indian grocery, where I obtained, for the same recipe, a small vial of asafoetida, which is a powdered resin from a plant in the fennel family, yellowish in color with a distinctive odor not unlike burned garlic. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our foodie forebears-but it was nothing compared to the cooking. <p> Here our shadowy Mesopotamian friends threw a few wrenches into the works. Unlike Hu 's detailed book, clearly intended as an instruction manual for healthy and flavorsome eating, the three cuneiform tablets I referenced -- happened upon unexpectedly among the tablets of the Babylonian collection at Yale University and translated by Jean Bottro in The Oldest Cuisine in the World-are essentially bits of information being passed from one professional cook to another. Knowledge of cooking methods is often taken for granted ; in the recipe for turnip broth, for instance, the cook is to " prepare the water " ; no further clues are forthcoming. In other instances, ingredients themselves remain mysterious. Bottro guesses when he can, based on other direct and indirect sources, but when it comes to ingredients such as samidu and kisimmu, the scholar is stumped. <p> While an author engaged in respectable research must refrain from undue speculation, guesswork is par for the course when you 're a contemporary home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example, the following instructions for " amursnu-pigeon in broth " : "... after cooking in broth and removing the amursnu-pigeon from the pot, you wipe it off. Then you indecipherable the stove, and stoke the fire indecipherable. I then roast the legs at high heat? ; wrap them in dough, and I place the amursnu-pigeon filets on the dish?.... " <p> As you can see, contemporary home cooks have their work cut out for them here. For starters, what the beck is an amursnupigeon? <p> I wound up using quail. First I removed the legs of the birds. These I roasted in high heat in the oven, while the bodies I gently poached in a broth made with a bit of animal fat( I used lamb), vinegar, leeks, garlic, onions, and shallots.( The shallots were my embellishment, an almost certainly inauthentic stab at the ingredient samidu. I thought shallots would be appropriate because the Mesopotamians, according to Bottro, were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to have used leeks, onions, and garlic together as a base in many of their recipes, much as the French use their " holy trinity " of carrots, celery, and onions.) Then I removed the birds from the broth, dried them, rubbed them with garlic, and served them on small flatbreads made with barley flour, baked on a hot dry. skillet -- the Mesopotamians would have baked them on the walls of a clay oven -- accompanied by bitter greens( I used watercress) and sprinkled with vinegar, with the roast legs alongside. Was it anything like amursnupigeon as the Mesopotamians ate it? Who knows? But the elements of what Mesopotamians would have found a worthy dish -- the flavors, the nutritional value, the presentation -- were there. <p> Turnips stewed with blood was, by comparison, a fairly straightforward affair. In one pot I braised quartered turnips in water until tender. In a second I sauted chopped onions in rendered lamb fat. Once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and crumbled in a small cake that I made of ground black sesame seeds, molded into a sort of freeform brick and baked until hardened.( This is my admittedly ad hoc improvisation on the seed " cakes " Mesopotamians made as a sort of pantry staple, to be added to everything from beer to, well, turnips in blood.) Once this flavor base was cooked through, I stirred in the turnips with a couple of cups of its broth, and poured in a quarter cup of blood. The blood looked very much like blood in my measuring cup, but once it hit the hot water it immediately thickened and darkened to an earthy brown color that coated the turnips nicely. <p> The quail broth I used to make an accompanying dish of simple barley porridge, flavored with a garnish of raw leeks, onions, and garlic, finely minced. One of the surprise delights of the meal, the porridge was more successful than the quail as an evocation of the Mesopotamian habit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exotic flavor was also treasured by the members of the Mongol court, if Hu 's book can be taken as an accurate guide. In common with other sophisticated cuisines around the globe, many of Hu 's dishes are named for ones they are meant to emulate in flavor, cooking method, or appearance. " Eggplant Manta, " for instance, is not actually a manta at all -- manta being a sort of stuffed, steamed dumpling -- but stuffed eggplant, the idea being that the eggplant skins fill in for the role of dumpling dough. I cut the eggplants in half, hollowed them out, and stuffed them with lamb( plus some extra fat), onions, and mandarin orange peel, then steamed them. This dish, served with a garlicky yogurt sauce with basil, shows the wide influences cooks of the empire 's court worked with. Stuffed vegetables, as Soup for the Qan authors Buell and Anderson note, were typical of contemporaneous Turkic cuisine, while the orange peel is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, is delicious. A lamb and vegetable stew was a smorgasboard of ingredients and methods gleaned from all corners of the Mongolian world -- yams, ginger, apricot kernel paste, carrots, pickles, and even a ten-egg omelet -- sliced up and stir-fried together before being placed in a lamb broth studded with meat. I flavored cakes of minced fish with ginger and mandarin orange, typical Chinese flavors( this after boning the carp-the arduous process of which goes a long way toward explaining why carp is not so popular these days), but also asafoetida, an ingredient much more typical of the Middle East and India. This and the cooking method -- deep-frying -- made me wonder if the inspiration for this dish might not have come from the onion-loving descendants of the writers of those ancient Mesopotamian tablets! <p> By comparison, Maya recipes seem familiar to our contemporary palates, a meaningful reminder of how much the flavors of the New World have influenced the way we eat today. Using recipes provided by the Legacy Program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Archaeological Research, I made plump corn masa tamales stuffed with turkey( a dish likely used for both rituals and everyday dining), garnished with a lime-spiked salsa, and a thin, bitter version of hot chocolate, sweetened with honey. A simple pumpkin soup of roasted pumpkin, thinned with turkey broth, flavored with honey and allspice, and garnished with pumpkin seeds and scallions, was beautiful to look at and surprisingly delicious as well -- the balance of sweetness, earthiness, and spice, and the textural contrast offered by the pumpkin seeds and onions, made for a complex, contemporary-seeming dish. I finished off with what the UTSA archaeologists call a " Honey-Vanilla Compote. " The dish of mixed fruits -- pineapple, guava, cherries, and grapefruit-stewed with honey and vanilla tasted great. Feasting on these lighter, brighter foods, not so different from what the home cooks of Latin America make today, I felt that it is the Maya 's culinary legacy that will stand the test of time. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Mesopotamian quail with porridge and bloody turnips, Mongolian mutton stew accompanied by stuffed eggplant and fish cakes, and turkey tamales with salsa, pumpkin soup, and hot chocolate, we were in need of a digestif, to say the least. Luckily, I had on hand some homemade Mongolian-style lamb liquor, which I 'd made by soaking a raw joint of lamb in some bottom-shelf vodka for a week. According to Hu, this concoction " greatly supplements and augments a person. " I do n't know about that. But it did sort of taste like lamb chop -- not half bad, actually. <p> While some of my bolder guests sipped the lamb vodka, we considered. The meal was enlightening indeed. Seeing all the ancient dishes side by side, some surprisingly tasty, others less so, it was apparent that no translation of a cuneiform tablet could demonstrate as clearly that, evolving palates aside, the pursuit of good eating is as old as civilization itself. And maybe the ancients still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not that I 'll be mixing up a batch of dry lamb martinis anytime soon.
