4002841 The Middle of the Twentieth Century witnessed the destruction of colonial systems in many parts of Asia and Africa. In the aftermath of the Second World War, newly independent Arab states seemed to brim with the promise of rapid socioeconomic development and an enhancement of quality. of life. Today, a half century later, development, measured in terms of achievements such as the progressive elimination of poverty, unemployment and inequality, seems an elusive goal for many parts of both the Third World and the Arab World. While in terms of sheer population numbers more people are living longer, the social and economic condition of their lives is often bleak. This is true particularly for some sectors of Arab society that have been ravaged by recent warfare, famine, poverty, military occupation, and/or the corrosive influences of internal divisions or external threats. <p> Education has been linked with Arab aspirations for national development at least since the reforms of Muhammad Ali in 19th century Egypt, although it is an even older remnant of the culture-wide appreciation for learning. Education furthers the national capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the most basic level, it is a country 's primary educational system that provides the bedrock for social and economic development. This is so because schooling is of critical importance to a nation 's human resource capacity. It provides young people with the cognitive skills( basic literacy, numeracy, communication and problem-solving skills) upon which they can later build. Thus it is the base for " all further schooling, training, or self-education "( A. Chantavanich et al, 1990:1). In countries where resources are meager and pupil retention rates are low, primary education is not only a base, it is also the ceiling of formal education. <p> While we can not expect miracles from primal, education, we can expect beneficial outcomes( Eisemon, 1987). A large body of evidence demonstrates that completed primary. education improves agricultural productivity and, more generally, productivity at work and in the home, facilitates literacy and communication, increases individual earnings, improves health and nutritional status, raises life expectancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see, for example, Lockheed and Verspoor, 1990 ; Habte et el., 1983 ; Psacharopoulos, 1984 ; Eisemon, 1989). These results, among others, are all indicators of social and economic development. To the extent that primary education can potentiate so much later growth and development, how do we assess Arab society 's preparedness and effectiveness in this area? Often educational development is measured by the proportions of people of a given age group who are in the educational system or who have successfully completed an educational cycle. Greater proportions are seen as reflective of equality of access and equality of access is seen as an indicator of optimal utilization of human resources. <p> Yet it may well be asked : Access to what? Access for what? Increasingly, research attention is shifting from enumerating pupils or graduates to queries concerning educational quality. What was once regarded as a politically sensitive topic has now come center stage : <p>... the experiences gained in two decades of reform and intervention experiments have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, although cultural differences remain, the quality of education can -- and indeed should -- be subjected to technical scrutiny.( Heyneman, 1986:3) <p> It is not just the existence of formal education but its nature which is at issue. Lockheed and Verspoor( 1990:vii) note that " the quality of primary. education in a country must be judged according to the total learning of all its children. To improve the quality of primary education, therefore, is to ensure that more of a nation 's children complete the primary cycle, having learned what is taught. " <p> In a relevant review of the literature on the quality of education and economic growth, Solmen( 1986:14) observes : <p> Improvements in the quality of schooling provided in developing countries may be more important for the future economic prospects of these nations in the long run than will expanded access to poor quality education. Thus the quandary of equity versus efficiency will have to be addressed in these countries as it has been in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quality of schooling has more effect on the cognitive and behavior outcomes for students in developing areas than in developed areas. Fuller et al. ' s( 1986) research in Mexico supports this with a study comparing levels of investment in school quality and the rates of growth a decade later. The reports from regional and international educational authorities suggest that the need to address the quality issue is nowhere more pressing than in developing countries ; even in those Arab countries where educational access is severely constrained, questions regarding the quantity. of education do not replace questions regarding educational quality( see, for example, Lockheed and Verspoor, 1990 ; Solmort, 1986 ; Habte and Heyneman, 1983 ; Psacharopoulos, 1984 ; Eisemon, 1989). <p> This paper examines issues relating to the quality of primary education in the Arab World. The study assesses the relation between excellence in education and national aspirations for socioeconomic development. The reality of development planning in the Arab world is that the constituent countries are not equivalent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevailing institutional arrangements. Hence, while our arguments are necessarily general to allow broad applicability, the practical utility of this analysis is contingent on sensitivity to each Arab country 's unique social, economic, historical and cultural conditions. <p> This discussion is divided into three sections. Following a brief note on research procedure, the first section provides a critical review of trends affecting the educational climate for Arab children. Secondly, we examine the quality of Arab primary education in terms of equity of access. This will be followed by a discussion of selected indicators of educational quality. Throughout the discussion, we suggest strategies and policy options which may help to improve the state of primary education in the Arab World. DATA <p> The statistical data provided in the accompanying tables are extracted from compilations by Lockheed and Verspoor( 1990:165ff). These compilations are based on the UNESCO database for education and the World Bank database for economic indicators. All the member states of the Arab League are included, with the exception of Palestine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Djibouti and Qatar). In these tables, the Arab states are grouped into four major economic groups based on 1986 GNP per capita data :( 1) " low-income " economies( where per capita incomes are less than $450) ;( 2) " lower-middle-income " economies( where per capita incomes range between $450 and $1700) ;( 3) " upper-middle-income " economies( where per capita incomes range between $1700 and $7425) ;( 4) " high-income " economies( where per capita incomes exceed $7425). These four economic groups are based on the World Development Report( World Bank, 1988). <p> Empirical evidence on the quality of education in the various countries of the Arab World is rather sketchy. No government has a system of assessment in place to evaluate children 's learning success or to monitor their educational progress. Programs are implemented but rarely evaluated. Good intentions can not replace informed assessment. Until rigorous Arab evaluation programs are in place, evidence from other developing nations facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDUCATIONAL CLIMATE <p> Generally, primary educational systems in the Arab World have been characterized by both success and failure. The most outstanding success is a quantitative one, illustrating the spread of primary education to include increasing numbers of children. Since the end of World War II, educational development has been a priority in virtually every Arab country. In terms of absolute numbers, the expansion of Arab education has been particularly dramatic at the primary level, with average enrollment growth rates exceeding population growth rates by a large margin. For several Arab countries, substantial gains were made between 1950 and 1965. But, for practically all of these countries the rate of educational growth has been even more spectacular over the last two decades. For example, between 1965 and 1985, enrollments at the primary level in the eighteen most populous Arab states increased by 250%, or from about 10 million to over 25 million( see Table 1). This increase is equivalent to providing schooling for an additional 2,100 pupils every day for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noteworthy trends in primary education in the Arab World include the provision of more teachers, schools, buildings, curricula and resource materials. In addition, school expansion has narrowed the gender gap in access to primary education, increased the proportion of 6-11 year-olds enrolled at primary levels, and improved the " internal efficiency "( i.e., raised the ratio of primary. school graduates to primary school entrants). <p> For most of the post-Second World War period, educational budgets rose steadily, although the rate of educational growth declined somewhat during the 1980s due to deteriorating social, economic and political conditions( Al-Bassam, 1989:70). In terms of financial resources, the recurrent expenditures on primary education in many Arab countries claim around 50% of the total educational budget. The high cost of primary education coupled with the downturn in the economies of many Arab countries may limit governments ' capacity to further develop the primary educational system. <p> While successes in educational expansion are noteworthy, it is important to recognize setbacks and obstacles which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist in sociocultural context. Social and political events at the national and regional level can undermine the experiences of school children. At this macrolevel, in certain parts of the Arab World, including areas which were once educationally advantaged, primary education has regreressed sometimes to the point of devastation, due to internal strife, warfare or military occupation by foreign troops. For example, the ongoing internal struggle both in Sorealia and the Sudan has deprived many children of proper education. Similarly, in Lebanon the civil war which started in 1975 has had adverse effects on the educational system at all levels. During most of the civil war, primary schools experienced extended closures and lost their efficacy and moral suasion in influencing children and maintaining standards. Also, in Iraq, in the aftermath of the Gulf Wax, the mental and physical health of school children is at risk as they face devastated resources and institutions( see Abu-Laban and Aliadin, 1991). In fact the disastrous effects of the Gulf War on school children extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example, close to a million Yemini workers were expelled from Saudi Arabia, severing the economic security, of large numbers of dependent Yemeni school children. Even in oil-rich Libya, school children are potentially vulnerable to geopolitical power plays as a result of the U.N. sanctions approved in mid-April 1992. <p> A similar illustration of educational catastrophe is found in the experience of the Palestinian people in the territories occupied by Israel since 1967. In all primary schools in the West Bank and Gaza, whether public, UNRWA or private, the system has deteriorated since the Israeli occupation. Within two months of the occupation, in August 1967, 78 of 121 textbooks used by Palestinian children were banned and education came under the sole control of the Israeli occupation authorities( Fasheh, 1989:516). Hence, neither in the hiring nor firing of teachers, nor in the continuing technical evaluation of curriculum objectives, development of curricula or new programs, nor in school construction did the Palestinians themselves have decision-making power. The Israeli occupation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years of the intifada, for example, of 210 school days per year, primary schools in the West Bank were ordered to close 63 days in 1987-88 ; 175 days in 1988-89 ; 70 days in 1989-90 ; and 51 days in 1990-91( B'Tselem, 1991). Such arbitrary closures wreck havoc on the education of all students but, given that they are still acquiring the basic skills necessary for independent self-education, primary students are put at particular risk. <p> What we have is a situation where entire cohorts of Arab children have their lives and their primary education disrupted by macrolevel forces rarely anticipated in formulating educational policies for developing countries. The repeated tragedies in their lives suggest that there are large numbers of Arab students with special needs which must be identified and assessed. <p> In addition, as will be illustrated in the following sections, Arab primary education is plagued by other problems including, among other things : falling short of the goal of universal primary education ; inequities in access to schools ; undertrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdated curricula ; poor quality and insufficient teaching materials ; and high dropout and repetition rates. Given that the majority of students in the Arab World do not go beyond the primary level, it is of critical importance that their education be of high quality and that they are cognitively equipped to solve new and more complex problems in their day-to-day lives. <p> While scant, the available evidence on the performance of Arab pupils in international achievement tests, national examinations, and end-of-year school examinations at different primary school levels underlines serious deficiencies in the internal efficiency of Arab primary education systems( Massialas and Jarrar, 1987 ; 1983). In other words, the process of developing children 's cognitive skills, the stated goal of primary education, is tarnished not only by deficits in the academic development of children, but also by wastage. Naturally, there are variations in efficiency across Arab countries and even within the same country, but no Arab country is exempt from the need to improve its system of primary education. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Organization( ALECSO) published a critical, future-oriented document titled/he Strategy for the Development of Arab Education which was as ambitious as it was pathbreaking. It dealt with the broad range of quantitative and qualitative problems confronting Arab education. The strategy was to be implemented in four stages within a fifteen-year span. A sequel to this publication assessed progress made in the implementation of the 1979 strategy( Al-Bassam, 1989). The results of this assessment show that Arab education is still in need of attention and qualitative improvements. The following sections will identify some of the main failings of Arab primary education and suggest remedial strategies( see also Verspoor, 1989 ; and Lockheed and Verspoor, 1990). EQUITY OF ACCESS <p> Access to education, a topic of much current research, is not limited to efforts to increase opportunities for enrollment. It includes, in addition, efforts to improve educational opportunities for all groups in society regardless of gender, geographical location or socioeconomic status, as well as efforts to increase student retention and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantitative and qualitative components in the educational system and, hence, it is multidimensional in nature and can be measured in different ways. <p> An obvious and simple way of measuring overall access takes the form of comparing the total number of students attending primary school at differing points in time. This approach may be extended to cover changes over time in the magnitude of educational resources such as teachers, schools, and educational materials. The evidence on any of these indicators may be presented at different levels : on a country-by-country basis, or for regions within a country, or for the entire Arab World. <p> It should be emphasized that enrollments are not entirely a function of supply of educational resources( i.e. schools and teachers) ; they are also a function of demand, i.e., interest on the part of different groups in accessing educational opportunities. On the demand side of the equation, the literature shows that there are " different patterns of access and retention among wealthy/poor, male/female, and urban/rural children "( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these patterns is determined by comparing the number of students from each relevant category with the total enrollment( e.g., females as a percentage of all students enrolled). <p> As indicated earlier, the total number of students enrolled in primary schools in Arab countries increased phenomenally between 1965 and 1985( Table 1). While absolute numbers provide a striking picture of educational growth, they are inadequate indicators of progress toward the goal of universal education. To assess this, we need to compare the number of students enrolled with the school age population( i.e., the 6-11 year olds). <p> Table 2 shows that between 1965 and 1985, the percentages of 6-11 year olds in school rose considerably for practically all Arab countries. In 1985, these percentages were highest in Libya, Syria, Tunisia, Iraq, Egypt, and Algeria, ranging from about 86% to 107% ; and lowest in Sudan( 45.6%), Mauritania( 33.2%), and Somalia( 9.6%). The remainder of the Arab states were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their wide range, that for many Arab countries, considerable work needs to be done before the goal of universal education is achieved. <p> In all of the Arab countries for which information is available, the proportion of female students at the primary level has been increasing, but there are still some sharp gender inequities in access to education( Table 1). In 1985, for example, the female percentage of the total enrollment ranged widely : 49% for Kuwait, 48% for Jordan and the U.A.E., 47% for Lebanon and Libya, 46% for Syria, 45% for Iraq and Tunisia, 44% for Algeria and Oman, 43% for Egypt and Saudi Arabia, 40% for Sudan and Mauritania, 38% for Morocco, 34% for Somalia, 26% for the People 's Democratic Republic of Yemen, and 20% for the Arab Republic of Yemen. Those Arab governments with gender gaps in access could play critical, innovative roles in improving educational accessibility for females by establishing outreach programs directed toward eliciting community and family support for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inequity in educational accessibility in the Arab World relate to socioeconomic status and place of residence. In many impoverished families, children are removed from school at an early age. In addition, numerous studies indicate that rural residents are markedly disadvantaged relative to urban residents( see, for example, Al-Bassam, 1989 ; and Cameron and Hurst, 1983:543). As with the gender gap, the class and rural-urban gaps in access to primary education could be narrowed by determined action. Efficiency of the Education System <p> A useful indicator of the efficiency of the education system is the graduation or completion rate, which is defined as the ratio of the number of students who complete their primary education to the number of primary school entrants. At the aggregate level, in North Africa and the Middle East, the completion rates have steadily over the years. In the 1940s, for example, 6 out of 10 entrants completed the primary cycle, compared to about 8 out of 10 at the present time. The observe of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hurst, 1983 ; and Horn and Arriagada, 1986). <p> Useful as it is. the completion rate does not take account of another aspect of efficiency and that is, the frequency of grade repetition in the system. Table 3 shows that there are substantial differences among the Arab countries in grade repetition rates, which in 1985 ranged from 1.5% for Egypt to 22.9% for the Arab Republic of Yemen. Between these two extremes are : Jordan( 4.7%), Kuwait( 5.2%), U.A.E.( 5.7%), Syria( 7.5%), Algeria( 7.5%), Oman( 11.7%), Saudi Arabia( 12.4%), Mauritania( 18.3%), Morocco( 19.8%), Tunisia( 20.4%), and Iraq( 20.8%). It is clear that the repetition rates in several Arab states are extremely high and special efforts could be made to cut down on this wasteful duplication. Strategies and Policy Implications <p> The preceding analysis indicates that Arab governments, in varying degrees, need to improve access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue of educational opportunities, planners should be clear on whether education is viewed as a goal in itself, that is, a basic human right, or as a means to achieving other goals such as socioeconomic development and/or national integration. This is important because each view entails a somewhat different set of policy options and priorities. For example, if education is viewed as a basic human right, then the stress would tend to be on universality and disadvantaged groups( such as the poor, distant communities, females, and ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities) would have to be singled out for special attention. On the other hand, if education is viewed as a vehicle for national development, the government would tend to define and target economically relevant groups, such as farmers, while emphasizing educational relevance and quality. <p> While budgetary constraints may discourage some governments from even attempting a start, this would be a missed opportunity because there are cost-effective measures that could be employed to improve both the quantity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature suggests that progress on these goals can be made without even increasing costs. The following suggestions for improving educational access are, therefore, mindful of current economic concerns. It is suggested that planners : Restructure training programs for primary school teachers. Eliminate unnecessary replication with secondary education and provide shorter, more focused programs which emphasize pedagogical training. Institute double shifts, where appropriate, as has been done rather effectively in Egypt and Yemen Arab Republic. Use existing institutions such as mosques for expanding the supply, as has been done effectively in small, distant rural settlements in Pakistan 's Sind province. Such arrangements are believed to be most effective if they take the " form of pre-schooling or after-school classes. "( Lockheed and Verspoor, 1990:107) Develop distance education methods, such as interactive radio programming, and other new learning technologies that are cost-effective and consistent with the cultural traditions. Mobilize community support and involve parents and local resources as much as possible in the educational process. Target specific groups( e.g., @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to support and facilitate their children 's education. Reduce wastage first, by increasing the completion rate and second, by reducing the grade repetition and dropout rates. Another noteworthy aspect of wastage concerns the production of underlearners, but unfortunately we lack systematic information on this. <p> The utility of the above noted policy options is contingent on a given country 's social, economic and cultural traditions. This means that education planners will place differential emphasis on these options to suit their local and national needs. No less important is the fact that access to education implies not only quantitative but also qualitative improvements in the education system. In fact, both of these aspects of accessibility are interrelated. The literature clearly shows that where there is emphasis on quality, a certain degree of quantitative improvement tends to follow automatically in the form of greater demand, community support. higher completion rates, and lower dropout and repetition rates. The next section of the paper examines the available evidence on educational quality and how it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructional methods and strategies, and more efficient management systems. SELECTED INDICATORS OF EDUCATIONAL QUALITY <p> Educators and political leaders have long known that basic education in the Arab countries needs to be overhauled. A legacy of the colonial past, the system is in a torpid condition and both the curriculum and associated educational materials require restructuring and upgrading( Lockheed and Vetspoor, 1990 ; Al-Bassam, 1989 ; Massialas and Jarrar, 1987 ; 1983 ; and Cameron and Hurst, 1983). All efforts to improve teaching and learning have met with partial success, at best. Curriculum <p> Naturally, the curriculum plays a central role in structuring the learning experiences of students. According to Bacchus( 1990), curriculum refers to the content of both formal and informal instructional and learning experiences, instructional strategies, materials and facilities and methods of evaluating the success of curriculum goals. Implied in this definition is an important distinction between the " intended " and the " implemented " curriculum. Actual curriculum implementation brings into focus teachers and textbooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " at the center of any efforts to improve the quality of basic education and implies... a coordinated effort in all the areas included.... "( Bacchus, 1990). <p> It may be useful at this point to make a few observations about curricular content in primary schools throughout the world. The evidence suggests that, worldwide, there are remarkable similarities in the subjects taught and the relative emphasis given to these subjects, regardless of the country 's level of economic development. For example, a recent study of 130 countries representing high, medium and low-income economies, shows that at each economic level about 35% of the available time is devoted to language ; 18% to mathematics ; 8-10% each to science, social studies, music and art, and physical education ; and 5% to moral studies. The main difference is found in vocational subjects( agriculture, domestic science and business), in lower-income economies, where 6-7% of the available time is devoted to these subjects, compared to only 1-2% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( see Lockheed and Vetspoor, 1990:31). <p> The curricular content in primary schools in the Arab World,. in general, is quite consistent with world patterns, but there are variations in emphasis across Arab countries. To a large degree, these variations center around greater or lesser emphasis on religious-humanistic subjects, foreign languages, and vocational and practical training. There are also differences attributable to the movements involving " Arabization " and " nationalization ", of the curriculum in Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco which began in the 1950s and 1960s. While some inter-Arab differences in curricular content are to be expected, there are educators( e.g., Massialas and Jarrar, 1987) who argue that the quality of primary education could be improved considerably by giving more attention to science and vocational and practical training and less attention to religious-humanistic subjects. This argument may be valid, but it should not be made in the abstract or in principle. To evaluate the curriculum, educators need to relate its content to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education. The curriculum may be structured differently, depending on whether education is viewed as an end in itself or as a means to other goals. <p> A much more promising course of action than simply adjusting the curriculum is to critically examine its development and implementation and how these two processes may be improved. For example, in all Arab countries, without exception, the curriculum is centrally developed by education ministry officials, with help from experts. Hence, it is imposed from above, with neither the community nor teachers having much say in the process. In this connection, it is important to note that studies carried out in other developing countries emphasize the significant contributions that parents and community leaders can make to curriculum development and reform. This is even more true where educational goals are directed toward equipping students to live and work successfully within their own communities( Bacchus, 1990). Still, another potential benefit resulting from stronger community-school links is that these may enhance children 's academic performance. Hence, curriculum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In terms of implementation, teachers are, of course, critical. Teachers <p> The curriculum 's stated goals are entrusted to teachers to achieve. It is important, therefore, to ensure teachers ' clear understanding of and commitment to these goals. How is this done? Modern social psychology tells us that participation in decision-making enhances commitment to the decisions made. In line with this, it would be beneficial to involve the teachers in the process of curriculum development and change. As well as improving the quality and relevance of the curriculum, teachers ' involvement would also increase the likelihood that it is successfully implemented. <p> Obviously, the teacher is the most central person in curriculum implementation and in providing opportunities for learning. The quality of education is determined largely by the teacher 's knowledge of the subject matter as well as teaching skills. Current reports on teachers and teaching practices in the Arab countries are not altogether complimentary. While some countries are better off than others, it is nevertheless the case that many Arab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they often employ teaching methods which alienate students and discourage their participation, independent initiative, and critical thinking. Teachers tend to be strict disciplinarian and authoritarian rather than educators with a wide range of instructional strategies( cf. Massialas and Jarrar, 1987). All too often, teachers expect their students to copy from the blackboard, memorize, refrain from asking questions and avoid making mistakes. In addition to being teacher-centered, the system is also dominated by examinations. It is a system for young children which is more fear- and conformity-inducing than discovery oriented. <p> Research evidence suggests that the opportunities for learning in Arab primary schools could be improved by exposing teachers to modern teaching methods and re-orienting them to become child-centered and encouraging of self-learning( Bude, 1990). The teaching practices most conducive to learning are those that involve the student as an active participant, giving him or her the opportunity to practice and apply what is taught in his or her own life( see Lockheed and Verspoor, 1990:42). In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve. In addition, the dropout, grade repetition and absenteeism rates would likely decline. Textbooks and Learning Materials <p> Recent studies and demonstration projects carried out in developing countries show that learning improves considerably with the use of textbooks, so much so that the World Bank Report on Education in Africa views textbooks as the single most important and cost-effective instrument for improving the quality of education( Bacchus, 1990). Like a good teacher, a good textbook is rare but it is necessary to have. Neumann( 1980:11) delineates the qualities of a good text : <p> Just as a lesson taught by a teacher is more than chalk and talk, a textbook page, a unit, or chapter, should be more than a recital of fact or a setting out of exercises. It must be visual : offer structure, variety, and present its materials in different ways ; it should motivate, spiral, and reinforce. A textbook must be organized and divided into units that fit the classroom situation, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide for individualization, for the different abilities represented in the classroom. <p> Judged in terms of the above noted qualities, textbooks in the Arab countries are found to be wanting. Cameron and Hurst( 1983:544) state that " textbooks and other teaching aids in the Arab countries are often in short supply, of poor quality and irrelevant content. " In a similar vein, Massialas and Jarrar( 1983:77) critically note that Arabic textbooks tend to present unrealistic pictures of society and are not up to date on scientific information. In terms of physical appearance, Arabic textbooks, in general, are neither attractive to the learner nor well illustrated. Because of these and other deficiencies, it has been noted that " many ' Arab countries experienced and continue to experience a state of affairs where texts are available but not often read "( Massialas and Jarrar, 1983:331 and 94-98). There is here a clear need to improve the quality of Arabic textbooks and make them relevant to the experiences of a broad spectrum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of instructional materials have impact on the quality. of education. Learning aids, which range from exercise books and notebooks to maps, science equipment, libraries and visual aids, are in limited supply and, when available, they are unevenly distributed. Schools in smaller communities and in rural areas are most disadvantaged. In addition, teacher guides, which are normally integrated with textbooks, help the teacher to use textbooks most effectively, monitor student achievement, and adjust classroom activities to suit the learners ' needs. In Arab countries, as in other developing countries, teacher guides are seldom available. The paucity of these materials further compromises the quality of primary education. Administration and Control of Education <p> To improve teaching and learning we must also look at the administration and control of education. This is an important area because it has a bearing on teachers ' morale, creativity and effectiveness and, ultimately, on student achievement. It is clear from the preceding discussion that in almost all Arab states, all major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other areas such as teacher selection, training and placement, and examinations are highly centralized in ministries of education. In fact, the system also reflects a high degree of centralization at the district( or regional) as well as the school level. With reference to the latter level, authority resides solely in the hands of the school principal. While the principal 's authority is not absolute, circumscribed as it is by higher levels of administration, he or she tends to be a strict, authoritarian administrator, allowing little decision-making power for the teacher to innovate and be creative. School principals are usually recruited from the ranks of teachers and, therefore, they lack the necessary administrative skills as well as specialized training. Given this state of affairs, there is a glaring need to modernize educational administration in the Arab World and to create a better balance between centralization and decentralization of administrative function. Strategies and Policy Implications <p> In the past 20-30 years, there have been many attempts to improve the quality of primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some countries have been more successful than others. However, the need to intensify efforts to improve teaching and learning in all Arab countries has never been more pressing. The evidence suggests that these efforts should concentrate on several areas including curriculum development and reform, upgrading of teacher qualifications and use of modern teaching methods. and modernization of educational administration. Judging from up-to-date studies conducted in developing countries, including some Arab countries. a list of policy options is provided below. While not exhaustive, the policy options proposed below have been identified with a view to cost-effectiveness and potential promise to achieve the desired goal : Involve parents, community leaders and teachers in the process of curriculum development and reform. Invest more heavily in curriculum implementation and, in particular, the production of high quality, relevant, textbooks with integrated teacher guides. Provide a wider range of learning aids and make them available more equitably throughout the system. Institute well designed in-service teacher training programs to upgrade teachers ' qualifications and expose them to modern teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view to placing more emphasis on the development of more appropriate teaching strategies and techniques( i.e. skills of the trade) as well as on student teaching practice. Encourage the utilization of non-directive methods of learning in order facilitate student participation in the learning process. Encourage and reward innovative practices among teachers and support the institution of experimental programs within schools in order to improve student achievement. Provide specially designed training programs for school administrators and others within the system, in order to enhance their administrative skills and modernize the administrative system. <p> As in the case of the suggestions made earlier, the above policy options and strategies may be applied selectively, with varying degrees of emphasis, sensitive to local and national varieties. However, sooner or later, all of these options, along with others, will have to be addressed if the goal of improving the quality of primary education is to be achieved. CONCLUSION <p> Social and economic development is a multifaceted process, an important component of which concerns the educational system( cf. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of primary education is based " on two considerations. First,. the evidence suggests that the social and economic impact of primary education is greater when educational quality is high. Second, with particular reference to the Arab World, a large proportion of children do not go beyond the primary level.
