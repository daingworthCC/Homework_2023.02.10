4021041 Today I awoke in a hurry. I did everything in a dizzying hurry : I bathed, dressed, ate breakfast, everything in a hurry. And quickly, I finished reading Don Quixote and I began The Divine Comedy. <p> I attribute this urgency to the Quixote, and to the date. <p> Yesterday, the 31st of December, the last day of a year, should have been, to be fair, the day I finished the last page of a book. But I did n't. I read : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> I continued reading until a plump man sat across from me at my table. We looked at each other. Silence. <p> I lowered my eyes to read the first word of the following verse. The man pounded the table with his right hand, which I was forced to lift. <p> This happened fourteen consecutive times. <p> I have a certain affinity or a certain superstition about the number fourteen. I stopped. I did not offer a fifteenth. I closed the book even though I felt a brutal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the next year. <p> Today I finished it : <p>. thanks to that of my true Don Quixote, are even now tottering, and doubtless doomed to fall for ever. Farewell. <p> The sense of hurry, now nested in me, kept pushing me. I picked up The Divine Comedy. As if under a spell of vertigo, I arrived at the following passage : <p> Entrai per lo cammino alto e silvestro. <p> Now the sense of hurry forced me to leave the house. <p> I took the book with me. It 's a big, heavy, hard-back book with illustrations by Dor. <p> With my book and my shoes, I ran through the streets. <p> A plaza. On one side a sturdy grey-stone building dominated by a huge tower. At the bottom, a small door whose threshold gave way to a staircase of the same grey-stone. <p> An idea : climb this staircase to the top of the tower, and stare out at the city and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I began to do this. I began to climb. But at the twentieth stair, I stumbled( what a beautiful word!) and The Divine Comedy fell from under my arms and rolled. <p> It rolled down the stairs. It came to the door, crossed the threshold, and tumbled through the plaza. It came to a stop near the center of the plaza, landed open on its back, wide open : page 152, canto 23. On one page, the text ; on the other, an illustration : between two steep and isolated cliffs, on smooth ground, a man of the earth, naked, on his back, arms spread, spread wide, feet together, crucified, there on the ground, on the smooth ground, between the isolated cliffs. <p> Dante and Virgil stared at this man. Beneath the illustration, the words : <p> Attraversato e nudo per la via, Come tu vedi, ed mestier ch'e ' senta Qualunque passa com'ei pesa pria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relentlessly. The Divine Comedy got wet, and oozed. The words melted onto the stones of the pavement. I climbed down the stairs, arrived at the book, bent over, reached out a hand and picked it up, hooking my index finger and thumb around the leather spine. I tossed it towards myself. Now, Attention! <p> Tenderly, slowly, I tossed it to myself. Arm, hand, and book began to shift with the slowness of a snail 's nightmare. <p> My arm folded across my body. My hand moved back, and dosed in. Its prey, the book, was also open. And with the book came the cliffs, the smooth ground, the two figures : Dante and Virgil. <p> Attention! Two figures. Not three. Because the crucified man, eternally crucified, did not come with them. In spite of the three nails, he slid around the page ; more accurately, the page slid, the entire book slid out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped out of the base. His legs, his back, his crossed arms, his nape, hit the pavement with a loud thump. <p> The three nails sunk into his legs. <p> I walked back towards the door with The Divine Comedy, which was soaking wet, and missing one of its characters. <p> I looked : the good man was now growing, taking shape. A strong, muscular man, with a black beard and shaggy hair, naked, crucified, nailed to the ground in the middle of the plaza with rain pouring on him. <p> I returned to my house. <p> My sense of hurry disappeared. Now, as I write, I am calm. I am filled with an incomparable peace. February 1st <p> Today I have had an extraordinary experience. Here 's what happened : <p> But before I begin : my biggest joy is my magnificent tenor voice ; and yet, I do n't sing, and when I do sing I sing like a pig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered my living room, went to the mahogany cabinet, opened it, pulled out a file with some records, and then I took the needle from my phonograph. <p> I stood in the center of the room. There I pointed the index finger of my left hand straight -- as straight as can be -- up to the ceiling, while my other fingers stayed locked in my fist. Ok. Then with my right hand, I positioned a record on my left index finger in such a way that its hole fit exactly over my nail. Ok. With this same right hand I began to quickly spin the record, skimming its side until it spun with astonishing speed. Then I picked up the needle and with my right hand -- arched and graceful like a swan 's neck -- I spun the first notes of the song. <p> And I opened my mouth. <p> I opened my mouth as wide as possible. <p> From my mouth, from my throat, from beneath my palate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips, deafening, thundering through the empty space, the voice of Caruso wildly sang : <p> Di quella pira! L'orrendo fuoco!! <p> An incredible moment! <p> I repeated this experience. But with no results. I repeated this fourteen times. You already know what I think of the number fourteen. I did n't try, thus, a fifteenth time. Which is not to say that this was not a day worth living. March 1st <p> Today I have been mourning. A great old friend has died. He died sitting on the ground, his arms crossed over his contracted legs, in a pose between mummy and drinker of mat <p> When I arrived at his house, he was still alive. He sat in the aforementioned pose on the carpet of his living room. His entire family, his doctor, and various friends were with him, waiting. Everyone, naturally, was standing. <p> After a half hour of waiting, the doctor raised a hand, and whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to shiver, The doctor whispered : <p> -- The last breath. <p> The wife of the unfortunate man then appeared. She stood tall, calm, and impressive. <p> She gracefully lowered her head. Many tears fell from her eyes. They fell on the back of my unforgettable friend 's neck, trickled down and disappeared in his spinal column and into the pressed collar of his shirt. <p> The doctor whispered in my ear : <p> -- Sit on all fours behind your friend. The moment he dies he will fall on his back. Collapsing on the carpet, plush as it is, must not be his first impression of death. Instead you must. Flesh upon flesh, my friend! Death with life! Jacket against jacket! <p> I was scared. It is not the same to see a man die in his bed as it is to receive him in your arms, to feel his jacket, beneath his jacket his sweater, beneath his sweater his shirt, beneath his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you are perched on all fours, in the middle of a living room, surrounded by grieving relatives, still and silent like the sinister alhuaquerecas. It 's not the same. And so I fled. <p> As I crossed the threshold, I heard an anguished cry and a muted thump : the cry of my friend 's unfortunate wife, and the sound of the soft carpet receiving the noble back, the noble head of he who was always the purest of men. April 1st <p> Today I took part in my irreplaceable friend 's funeral.( n1) <p> As I sat in my room weeping, the first stratum of my brain, the one next to the cranium, thought of how life without my friend would be a perpetual disappointment ; meanwhile, the interior stratum thought of how these tears, once dried and solidified, would, if ingested with wine, undoubtedly produce a substance that would make me think that the death of my unforgettable and exemplary friend was of little importance. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somber chords of Chopin 's funeral march. I said : <p> -- Here comes the funeral procession! <p> And I ran like a madman to join it. But I did not arrive at my destination. For the windows of my house, in the colonial fashion, have thick iron bars ; I collided with one of them like a butterfly, like an insect with the radiator of a speeding car. <p> The door? Why did I not use the door? <p> My dear and old friends, you who are alive, if I knew why I ran to the window and not the door, you can be sure that at this moment I would not be writing, instead I would be relaxing, smoking in peace and not thinking about my dead friend, about you, or even about myself. <p> But I do n't know why I ran to the window. <p> From between the bars, I looked down at the procession. <p> At that moment, the cavalrymen passed by. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. They blanketed the buildings ; they blanketed the sky. They marched in perfect formation, each with a wiry smile,( n2) slicked back hair, an astrakhan hat over the right ear. Each rode a big black horse. But as they passed, they got smaller. <p> I could now see the sky. I could now see the buildings across the street. I could see them in their entirety. Now I was forced to look down, at the pavement, to see the strapping cavalrymen. <p> Until the last one passed ; he was as big as a mouse. <p> The hearse then appeared ; it was small, tiny, balancing like a ship in a tempest each time it crossed the groove between two cobblestones. And his relatives who walked on both sides of the car were like ants, like teeny, weeny ants. <p> My unforgettable friend! May 1st <p> Today I crossed the threshold of my library. I had not been in it, not even once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust. It was filled with a dim light that had darkened over time. An insect buzzed around the lamp, seventeen years! And on my work table, the Songs of Maldaror by the Comte de Lautremont. <p> I was overcome with emotion as I once again saw my bookshelf. It gave off a tepid warmth. Fading print clung to the cover of each book. Silence. <p> Silence, yes. And soon my ears, adapting to the silence, heard a trivial, trifling murmur ; a murmur of piercing insignificance, an almost microscopic, yet implacable murmur. <p> I immediately understood what was happening. <p> Those vermin-bibliophiles, whose names I will ignore, those vermin who make their bread from abandoned libraries, were feeding on the words of the thousands of authors that silently formed on my bookshelf so that I -- whenever the Spirit moved me -- could release them from their silence and make them speak once again to my ears. <p> I opened the book by Lautremont and began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one vermin, no more than one. Its cadaver lay on the table, only a few inches away. Desolate cadaver in the plains, an unburied cadaver rotting in the dust. This is the story that had taken place when it was alive : <p> It began with the opening of an orifice in the back cover of the book, just in front of the space occupied by the last letter of the last word of the last line of the last song, which ends : <p> It is nevertheless true that the crescent-moon shaped garments no longer take the expression of their definitive symmetry from the quaternary number : go and see for yourself, if you do not believe me. <p> The vermin had perforated the last e in " believe me. " <p> Then he continued his slow and arduous labor, not as any superficial spirit would imagine it, and definitely not in a direct, vertical line. He continued in an oblique route up a slanting, inclined plane, treading softly, at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunnel of paper and ink, in pursuit of the first letter of the first word of the first line of the first song, which begins : <p> May it please heaven that the reader, emboldened and having for the time being become as fierce as what he is reading, should, without being led astray, find his rugged and treacherous way across the desolate swamps of these sombre and poison-filled pages ; <p> Here, the little beast perforated the first M. <p> And since the book was open, the little beast finally saw, after months, perhaps after years of grief and shadows, of the howls and curses of Maldoror, it saw once again the filtered light of my silent library. <p> It had worked its way through those 280 pages of " poisoned swamps " with a " wild and rugged " desolation and had received in its sleeping little body -- like a new Christ for our modern day brothers -- as much as a man can suffer trying to rebel and fight. <p> Noble little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see hope : in the second song, as it traveled through each page of the hymn to the louse. And when its simple nervous system received the voice that sang : <p> And yet you still do not know why they do not devour the bones of your head, why they are satisfied with ceremoniously extracting the quintessence of your blood. Wait a moment and I will tell you : it is because they do not have the strength. You may be sure that if their jaws conformed to the measure of their infinite desires, your brain, the retina of your eyes, your spinal column and all your body would be consumed. Like a drop of water. <p> at that moment the little beast, from its dark prison, sent its " infinite prayers " of infinite honor up to Lautremont. <p> Everything else it experienced on its journey was exceedingly cruel. As soon as it completed its grueling work it started to run. <p> It fell from the book to the table. It kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and, on imploding, its microscopic soul was taken to the Great Almighty. <p> Noble little beast! <p> Today, I gave it a dignified burial beneath The Song of Songs. June 1st <p> Today I experienced one fury after another, bouncing back and forth between furies, one fury, a second, a third, and so on. <p> First : <p> I left the house. A group of ragged old ladies were standing in line in front of the School of Advanced Polytechnic Studies. Certainly they were waiting for something, but what could eleven old ladies be waiting for at the School of Advanced Polytechnic Studies? <p> This question hit me like a projectile : What could they be waiting for? And that was sufficient : the fury dominated me. <p> I walked through the streets and passed the school : 1) enjoying all the privileges of freedom provided to each honest citizen of a model Republic ; and 2) in full enjoyment of my freedom from the moment I awoke ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> However, after walking only one hundred meters, eleven old ladies nailed me to the sidewalk, keeping me from advancing and denying me my republican liberties ; and then one question appeared before me, and called into question an assumption I had held for forty years : that I am a free man who only asks questions that he, and not others, wants to ask. <p> What could eleven ragged old ladies be waiting for at the School of Advanced Polytechnic Studies? First fury. It took a tremendous effort to move my feet from the concrete and continue my walk. <p> Second : <p> I moved my feet and walked. Alone. The pedestrians I passed slipped off me like ice. Alone, moreover, with my first fury. And a man alone with his fury is a danger. yes, a danger. but to himself, not to his fury. <p> I walked, then, to the house where my friends live. <p> The house has nine floors. On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives one of my friends. In total : nine ascending friends : on the first floor lives a great friend ; but on the second floor is an even greater friend ; and on the third floor, even greater. Thus, as the floors rise, so does the level of friendship, until the ninth floor. <p> When there is absolute peace in my spirit, when not even a swelling can be perceived, I visit my friends on the first and second floors. And when some passion begins to stir in me, I climb the stairs in exact proportion to the potency of that passion. I rarely visit my dear friend on the ninth floor. But when I do visit him, our friendship extends, and explodes, like a powerful bomb. <p> After the eleven old ladies, I arrived at the threshold of the door of the house where my nine friends live. Calculations made and furies weighed, I decided to bypass the first, the second, the third, the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Cordial greetings. Then I explained to my great friend what had brought me to his house. He listened attentively. Finally, he said : <p> What a beautiful morning! Go out on the balcony. No discussion. Although you have walked quite a bit in search of peace, it is not the same, I assure you, as searching for peace while standing still. <p> I went out on the balcony. A beautiful morning, indeed. The beginning of winter. Cool air. And radiant sunshine. <p> Yes, sun, so much sun. Which is why below, on the streets and on the sidewalks, each man who passed dragged along his shadow. <p> Second fury : <p> Irremediably, a shadow for each man. Irremediably, a perfect imitation in the shadow of each movement of each man. <p> Fury. I will explain. I will explain the key to why this fury -- of the shadows -- attached itself to the other fury -- the old ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an explanation for why the second fury remained atop and separate from the first fury, which was able to maintain its own force and presence, just as the second fury maintained its own presence. A double weight, a double anger. Now let us distinguish between them : <p> In the first case the old ladies were the pretext that inflamed my fury. But my complete fury relapsed, and the old ladies, somehow or another, remained outside of it. <p> My fury, perhaps, encircled me, without penetrating me, and I stayed within its sphere, free, calm, ignoring it the way one ignores the air one breathes. <p> The fury then collided with the eleven old ladies, and materialized in the form of an interrogation. It bounced off them. It became empowered within me because the interrogation enveloped me, squeezed the life out of me and asked me how it is possible that a sovereign man can be stopped by the first contradiction he finds on the street : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wide door of the School of Advanced Polytechnic Studies. <p> The fury raged against me, a sovereign forty-year-old man. <p> But in the second case it is completely different. What fury could have affected me, isolated and unattached as I was on the balcony on this radiant morning? But I have an anger, a deadly hatred, of all the men who pass on the sidewalk, who walk from the shady side of the street to the sunny side of the street. <p> They walk past. They pass from shadow to light, from light to shadow. Like a spout of water that splashes feet, they spread a dark appendage against the luminous ground. They enter the shade : their feet suck up the appendage, which loses itself in the legs and disappears. This happens to every one, every single one. <p> I look at their faces. I have a small hope : that in at least a few of them, in two or three, there will be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, as their unraveling is sucked up by the shadow. Nothing! <p> They are preoccupied by everything, everything alters their physiognomy : another pedestrian, a car, a tram, a woman in her window, the newspaper, a cigarette, a dog in the street. Everything, except that which they spread against the ground, which they themselves absorb with their entire body. Which is why this, amid so much else, remains inexorable : shadow in the sun, no shadow in the shadow. <p> They walk past. From all sides, in all directions. Their physiognomy changes at the site of a fly lost between cars and streetlights. <p> But nothing changes in the face of the inexorable. Not one gesture, not one little scowl. Cowardly men! <p> If, at the very least, one, only one man stood today in the center of the street, and protested at the top of his voice, his fists raised towards the sky, protested the unraveling of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silhouette is not drawn resplendently in the shadowy pavement. But nothing! <p> Cowardly men! <p> I lash out at them with my mortal anger. Not at myself, a pure man, elevated in the frame of a friend 's balcony. <p> Earlier against myself, now against the others. That is why the two furies are superimposed, each with its own force. A double anger! <p> And now, slowly, an old Victoria goes by at a short trot, with its old coachman, and in the front an old horse. And the three of them, coachman, coach, and horse, project upon the gold of the pavement three old and bluish dodderers who quiver with each slow trot. <p> The fifth friend on the fifth floor can not calm my rage. <p> I say good-bye. I continue climbing the stairs. I ring the doorbell of my ninth friend on the ninth floor. Onward! <p> Third : <p> My friend does n't say a word to me. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I go there : the beginning of winter, cool air and sunshine. <p> I do not look once more at the streets. I look forward, at another house, as large as the one I am in now. Windows and more windows. Through those windows I spy into the life of the other house. <p> Third. <p> That house across the street. As soon as I saw it, an idea consumed me, detonated within me : the idea of : " a whole " In this whole there were no parts, or if they existed, they were secondary. Floors, windows, walls, etc.. secondary. One house, one totality, one being. The house in front of me, fixed in a spot in the city, in the world. One house, an indivisible house. All of it following one destiny, to its proper and definitive end -- which is, exactly, its destiny. Like my own destiny -- the course of my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if my right hand has a different destiny than my left, this difference is also part of one indivisible, unique destiny : mine. <p> In the house across from me, the same thing. <p> And for those who live in the house, the same. Because they belong to the house, the house includes them, and if any of them try to claim, all the same, their own existence, the totality always takes precedence : the house. <p> From across the street, I stand on my own. My destiny, my fate, is something else. I stand outside of that life current. I look on, alone and distant. <p> On one floor, merchants hard at work unfold and balance silks for a woman who touches and smells them. On a higher floor, several typists. Above them, exactly at my level, a family has breakfast : a man, a fat woman, a girl, and a little boy. And above them, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of an old man appears behind the glass and against the frame ; sometimes I see his eyeglasses ; less frequently, I see his white mustache, but always -- every half minute -- his bald head freezes for an instant, turns, and disappears into the ashes of his home. <p> A totality : the house, the destiny of the house with its globules. <p> Me : a different destiny, a different fate. <p> Thus : <p> Third fury : <p> I could see what they were doing. Yet they could not see amongst themselves. <p> The first was directed at me. The second was directed at others. Now this fury was directed at God. <p> And now I, on my ninth friend 's balcony and across the street from the neighbors, performed, in miniature, like a louse, the role of looking into a world -- though it was only a small part of a house -- and seeing what those within that world saw only in sections. A small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of the half minutes! The moment, for example, when, approaching the window, he pressed his white mustache against the frame. <p> At that very same moment, the man on the floor beneath him coughed, and one of the typists on the lower floor swiftly flipped back her golden hair. So what? <p> Something, something large : <p> I thought of the last century of the human era. I then multiplied all the successive events that could occur, and I launched them beyond the earth, to the planets, to the entire cosmos, to measure them at the same time. An enormity of actions in an immensity of time. <p> But however enormous the actions, and however immense the time, the smallest, most miniscule actions are never, ever, in their fleeting, colorless moments, understood by those who take part in them. The actors never understand. But I do. <p> The old man never knew, never knew that at the moment his mustache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his own totality, had released a cough into the air. And the man who coughed could not know -- however much actions and times are exaggerated -- that his cough occurred at the exact same moment when a woman flipped back her frothy golden hair. <p> This coincidence passed like a needle through these three points of action, forming a line which linked together these actions in one common and isolated instance, a line that will forever be ignored, even if we extend time and events beyond all possible calculations. <p> And I will understand this throughout the course of my own proper eternity. <p> At that moment the lady who touched and smelled the silks was standing still. If she had spoken, or lifted an orange silk, or if she had collapsed into an inanimate state, I would have known. <p> But the old man, never. Never would he know that his white mustache, which touched the wooden walls of the window frame, was in the same line of events, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the silks. <p> But yes, I would know. <p> The woman could have died. Her soul, carrying its virtues and sins, could have flown off to the throne of the Supreme Creator, to become undone, and to be seen and judged. Moreover, it could or could not have been that soul 's destiny, to continue -- its spirit traveling, suffering -- ignorant that its undoing was in the same line of coincidence as the woman flipping her golden hair, as the man 's jolting cough, as the mustache of the old man pointing towards the street like the teeth of a furious dog. <p> She is ignorant. I am not. <p> Something, yes, something large. It is something large to have had a bit -- as small as it may have been -- of God 's vision of four people in one house in one instant who were " one " and who did not know of their union, and never would know. <p> It went against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only for an instant, and even though it kept in check the minuscule nature of my existence -- that I played a small part in His experience. But I want to continue in my role ; I want to continue, without distractions or illusions, to be a human worm who slithers along, and who, when he senses his own helplessness, openly cries to the fires of Hell. <p> Not even my ninth friend could return peace to my spirit. <p> Nine floors in the opposite direction. Streets, long strides. A search for peace down another path. July 1st <p> Today I wandered aimlessly. Behind me, at each step, the finger of God. I have felt it at every moment. Twice it stuck into my neck. <p> He did this lightly, as if mistakenly. Like a glimpse of a glimpse, entwining me in my own ideas about his identity. <p> This is what happened : <p> I was walking along a busy central boulevard. Suddenly, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collided. Commotion, vociferations, and so on. Two men slapped each other. Injuries, one death, Public Assistants, police officers. For a moment I thought this was going to change the direction of the entire city, and thus the entire nation. But in one minute, perhaps less, everything was calm. The disturbance disappeared like a magic trick : arguments, police officers, Public Assistants, curious bystanders, everything. The boulevard 's normal circulation returned without absorbing even a trace of what had occurred. <p> And just as the street had returned to its normal appearance, Estanislao Brun, walking in long, loud strides, appeared at one corner, with his little gold glasses and his curved back and his briefcase of stocks and bonds tucked beneath his arm. And he walked past. <p> He walked past -- what! -- and then walked over, trampling, clicking his heels, on the very site, the exact spot where, only seconds earlier, the two vehicles had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injuries had occurred, where someone had died, and where the public order had dissolved. And he walked past, I repeat, that same spot, step by step, without noticing a thing, without smelling a thing, practically erasing the existence of the accident, an unlikely being coasting along, one millimeter from, a half millimeter from a sensational act, which he had no idea about, and which he never would know about. <p> For twenty minutes I stood still on the corner without understanding, or, more accurately, understanding as absurdity these paths of destiny, these winding threads that intertwine but never make contact, each one lost in its own world of ignorance, side by side, in a world of not-knowing. <p> I continued to wander around. Now I am walking down a quiet street, with little gardens on one side, small residential houses on the other. One of these houses : a friend 's house, an acquaintance, really, whose name I will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be perfectly unfriendly, and because I consider him to be one of the most illustrious examples of our imbecility. <p> It is 3:32 in the afternoon. The upstairs windows of his study are closed, the downstairs windows are open. An unmistakable sign that the man in question is inside. Moreover, there are other signs that he is there. There can be no doubt that he is inside. <p> Ok. This character wants to see me, needs to see me, my presence or absence could alter, for better or worse, his destiny. But various circumstances( about which I must keep quiet) oblige us to meet each other by mere chance, and nothing else. There is no room for any other option. <p> In summary : he is inside ; I am on the street, walking. <p> I walk past his house, slowly. <p> I am his destiny, a possible change in his destiny that he desires and needs. <p> It is exactly 3:33. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man is submerged in his old parchment papers. I walk past. <p> I pass, and move away from the house. Now I am outside of, and far from, his orbit. <p> He has no idea what slow, parallel thread of destiny just passed him, one step forward, would have entwined the various lines that have twisted through his existence. <p> He has no idea. None! Not even the slightest vibration on one page of his old parchment papers. Not even an inopportune insect that causes him, exactly at 3:33, to break from his work and make a different gesture. Nothing! <p> I pass his house, with the finger of God on my neck, pushing me forward. <p> Twice the finger of God. The effect : exhaustion, fatigue. <p> But in the evening, this evening, a distraction will come, a rest. The cynic of Valdepinos will have dinner with my brother Pedro and myself. Cynical he may be, but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worries, and brings peace. <p> At exactly nine on the dot the tall figure of the cynic of Valdepinos came to the door. <p> Before I continue : <p> There are two things, two entities which should always be united, or which -- to state it better -- should have always remained united. Alas, destiny has thrown them from one side of the Earth to the other and does not allow them to be together, for one of them is in the beautiful country of Chile, while the other can not find a way of leaving the sweet land of France : the cynic of Valdepinos is here ; Pernod, is there. <p> But this is in principle, as if someone declared it " the Law " In reality, in a loose and dying reality, life does not always follow the rule of law : some time ago, a friend who lives in Paris sent me two bottles of Pernod. <p> The first one was finished months ago, but the second has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its contents( I keep half of its contents hidden). A half which must be defended, like the land of honor, drop by drop! As if the bottle 's final drop will be the last to ever spill in the history of Chile. <p> The cynic of Valdepinos eats and talks. Behind him, a cabinet which hides in one of its compartments the final half liter : thick, silent, like opal. If the cynic of Valdepinos knew! <p> We eat, we talk. But from time to time I sense something uncomfortable passing above our plates. <p> Pedro is struck by a memory : in the same cabinet, near the back, he once stored an aged bottle of red wine. He gets up in a storm, opens the cabinet, sticks his hand in and pulls it out : he holds between his fingers the bottle of Pernod. <p> Pedro, with his unbearable indiscretion, with his unforgivable absentmindedness, lifts the bottle into the air and, as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places it with the same storminess on top of the cabinet, behind the head of our great and cynical friend. <p> There is the cynic ; I am facing him. The outline of his pointy, suspicious, bird-face, his newly balding head. Above his head, crowning it, like another bird perched on the head of the cynic, the Pernod. <p> And the cynic of Valdepinos swallows and talks, indifferent and undisturbed as he tells the story of a hysterical old woman we all know. <p> Twenty-four seconds! Pedro looks for his bottle of red wine, he finds it, holds it, feels it. Twenty-four seconds! <p> He stretches out his hand, grabs the Pernod. The Pernod disappears. He closes the cabinet. Good Lord! For twenty-four seconds -- I repeat -- the cynic 's most cherished pleasure sat above and behind him. A shift of the eyes, and we would have drunk it to the last drop, and our ideas would have been different, our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In any case, this is certainly true for the cynic of Valdepinos. <p> But he had no idea. He did n't even suspect that for almost half a minute the sweet antidote to his Parisian nostalgia was ten or fifteen centimeters behind his head. <p> At this moment he is probably walking in solitary strides through a dark street. Poor Valdepinos! <p> As for me, I have returned to the seat I occupied during the meal. I have taken out the bottle of Pernod and returned it to where Pedro thoughtlessly left it. <p> The bottle of Pernod had been for the cynic of Valdepinos what I had been for the old man of the parchment papers. And the cynic of Valdepinos, moreover, had been for the bottle of Pernod what Estanislao Brun had been for the accident on the boulevard. <p> Nobody -- neither man nor bottle -- knew anything. <p> Except me. <p> Thus today, once again, I have gone against God. August 1st <p> Today I lived a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Very early in the morning, the writer Csar Mir appeared in my study. He took a seat. And remained silent. Finally, he told me the following : <p> He had woken up in a good mood. He had jumped out of bed full of optimism. He had sat on the balcony, where his sense of happiness and optimism grew stronger : in the middle of the Plaza de Armas, he had seen his " Man dressed in green " speaking in a powerful voice, surrounded by public interest and enthusiasm. A good start to the day! Then he went back to bed and read the newspaper. <p> This was his happy moment and, through friendship, mine. But let 's continue : <p> Mir lies peacefully once more in his bed with two arms at his side. Between them, the newspaper, spread open, and waiting to be read. But this is no time to read. He thinks about the spectacle in the plaza. Yes, let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper release a murmur, as if from the universe, which buzzes around the ears. He has to read. Mir lifts the newspaper up to his eyes, leaving it perpendicular to the surface of his still waters : his bed, his body, the floor, and the earth. He lifts the paper abruptly. He holds the paper, and looks at it. And here begins the second moment, the moment of grave concern : <p> As soon as he lifted the newspaper and brought it to the perpendicular position, every letter of every word on the first page, every one, without exception, came loose, detached itself from the newspaper, and fell with the quivering sound of a bell. <p> My dear friend! Alone in his room with a blank page before his eyes. My dear friend! Covered with thousands and thousands of meaningless, scattered letters. <p> And now the arduous task of putting them back in place, thousands and thousands of letters, one after another, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corners of the world. <p> He picks up two I 's, which must, without a doubt, belong to the words HIS HIGHNESS, who just got married. Progress! But they might also belong to RIBERI, who committed suicide. <p> He picks up an H and he picks up an E. There is not a newspaper that does not print each day on its front page the words His Excellence, which is abbreviated with the letters H. E. He continues, in this manner, down a safe path. But a doubt appears in his mind ; has he made a profound error, for the H may have referred to the Holy sites that were desecrated last night ; and the E could have referred to the Employers who on each continent quietly oppress their workers. <p> What difficult work : so fraught with dangers this interminable task of adjusting each fallen letter to recreate the word that brought them to life. <p> Better to abandon this mess and seek the advice of a friend. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step a letter untangles from his clothes. By my shoes there is an F ; a T hangs from the bars on the window ; an O bounces off the floor, rolls around and collides with an insect calmly bathing in the triangle of sun that visits my study at 9 o'clock each morning. <p> I can not find any advice to give him. <p> He leaves my house. <p> As he crosses the threshold, he drops a lower-case i, a pathetic i from some lost word that at one moment had an actual meaning. There it stands, erect, balancing its little dot. <p> As long as I shall live in this house, I will take care to not step on this i. And I will always turn to salute it. And it will stay in my doorway, like a guard who keeps my domestic worries from leaving the house, and who keeps the outside world from entering. September 1st <p> Today I have come to the coast. So many of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the city and search for equilibrium by the ocean. <p> I have sat on some rocks : the waves at my feet, and all that the poets sing of. <p> I have watched one of these waves for a period of an hour or more. It inflated, slipped, exploded, and dissolved. But the way it returned, always in the same form, it was always the same, throughout the entire hour or more, throughout all of the past, and most likely into the future as well. <p> Having made this discovery, and with an unshakable faith in it, I set out to ponder other thoughts, but before doing so I measured, and precisely demarcated the size of the unique wave, as we so spontaneously do in order to continue our meditations, in front of a tree, an animal, a colleague, or whatever thing that comes before our eyes and asks to be understood. <p> On this task I spent more than an hour, perhaps two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not measure or demarcate anything. Because : <p> The wave comes in hidden beneath its own spine. It comes in with a long and sordid convulsion. Without a doubt, it hides its head, it sinks its head downwards, not wanting to expose itself to the breeze, to the sun, to the sky and the birds. It thinks only of the ocean 's depths. And I only see the pain of its uncovered spine. <p> That was it. There was a vast pain in front of my eyes. But I could not clearly see a definite body to measure. This pain would stay in darkness, in smoke, disorienting spectators across the world. <p> The wave. The wave is one, one solitary entity. It is one, absolute in its existence. This solitary entity is what suffers. It does n't matter that it dissolves. It remakes itself. It remakes itself thousands of times because its pain continues. <p> Fine. But let 's rigorously demarcate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thickens, and howls. <p> Now it twists, edges into white, curves, thunders. Thousands of specks of foam jump. The flowers behind it tremble. The sun in front of it shivers. A man stops. A dog barks. White specks jump across the entire sky. And at my side, here at my feet, in a narrow ridge of wet rocks, a trail of water, agile as a lizard, moves slowly, climbing, licking. It stops, and returns, snaps towards the solitary wave. <p> We measure. <p> The solitary wave, like an octopus, has extended its tentacles. One of those tentacles has come all the way to me. This sibilant water is always the wave ; it is within its limits and demarcation. Proof of this is that it re-gathers near the body. <p> Once more it stretches. Better said, it stretches out a tentacle. It comes. Sprinkles. It stops three meters from my post. It reaches a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, feels, pokes. It must pick up grains of salty, violet patina. It must feel a sweet, velvety pleasure as it pricks the moist and perfumed puddle with its tip. <p> The puddle has two concavities. The first one is big, the second one is smaller. Both are practically circular. They nearly form a stretched out 8, the bottom pointing towards the sea ; the head towards the mountains. <p> The water rolls around inside. It dives into the first section, it searches every nook, it explores every last crack. It touches the joining neck. It examines the neck, quickly, and with certainty. It continues. It springs forward. It fills the second concavity. The solitary wave, submerged now in the ocean, experiences a healthy, salty pleasure, a pleasure repeated a thousand times throughout this vast camp of rocks and crossroads. <p> Fine. I am only responsible for this final bit that 's next to me. <p> The water inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small concavity is looking for an entry into the larger one. Once more it stirs around. Each drop of water wants to be the first to pass into the neck. No drop wants to remain still during the interval between the two movements. The entire small puddle fights, moves, intensifies, cries out for the vast sea from which it came. This homesick water completely enters the blue line of the deep horizon. <p> And I, from my post, observe the limited and disturbed life of the water in the second puddle. <p> It lives. It completes its task. It arrives, takes off, arrives. As I have said : homesick. <p> Therefore, it is not the wave. It is a separate entity, an independent unity. Thus? <p> The end of the large monster has to be marked as the neck of the 8. Its head, which looks out at the mountains, has become independent, has individualized. Throughout all of this immense being lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but which conquers the personality, and sharpens its instincts, if only in between rocks. <p> To measure the neck. But the body of the 8 lives the same life. The same phases, the same tragedy. And not only is there a similarity between the entire stream of water and a lizard : but there is as much life here as in the lizard as well. <p> Ok, then. I followed that trail until it finally fell into the ocean. <p> I glanced at the front of the wave at the moment it broke. A few minutes of contemplating the small puddle completely changed the panorama of the waters. <p> Each section of the waters, each piece in the wave, lived on its own. There was an isolated being in each section covered by my eyes, in each focal point, with its own purpose and passions, in the midst of millions of others, running along a parallel destiny. parallel, but nothing more. Thus the solitary wave, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exist. It stood alone as an aggregate of different destinies bound together by a supreme design : an immaterial design with no body, with no head, no submerged head, no painful spine brushing the air. <p> The solitary wave was nothing more than a collective movement. A movement, a purpose, an abstraction. <p> Living as matter, as body, as nerves, with each circle drawn individually over the whole by the rays of my eyes. Like the spout that shoots white foam straight up to the sky, where it splits into fireworks. Here in my vision there has been no focal point ; I have followed from bottom to top, and sung like a bird. And precisely above, where both water and vision have come to a halt, hundreds of points of water in hundreds of directions have at the same time individualized, and they have created, in the long meters of water, their global destiny, which bends them. <p> I can do nothing but stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living reality, like me, and like all the isolated men and beasts who live and suffer, alone, with one destiny and only one world inside their body. Nothing but these drops, nothing else, because my eyes are not made to divide the world beyond. <p> My eyes stop there. There I stop. Until I begin again -- drops of water, solitary wave, puddles, foam -- leaning over the silence of a microscope. Better to continue inversely. Measure on a large scale, sliding over the enormous spine. <p> That 's how I have done it. <p> I have proceeded like a tube opened at each end which has spread to the infinity of the ocean. No more small individual beings pulsing in a common movement : now, moving parts, members, from one larger being which grows, becomes giant as my imagination navigates above the horizon. But I have not focused my eyes on any one part so as not to awaken and make dance the millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they came into my sight. <p> I have stayed well away from it, to the point where I have been forced to look at the sky : five wild ducks fly past in a triangle. <p> It is preferable to come to terms with ducks -- even if there are five of them -- than with raging waves. Man occupies in size, more or less, the midpoint between an atom and a star ; therefore we are more or less the same in relation to the infinitely large or the infinitely small. But in size, and in all other ways, we are much closer to the duck than to the ocean. Therefore, there is no reason to take a position in relation to the latter when the former passes before your eyes. <p> Proof of this is that if a pain were to come from the ducks -- as it comes from the waters -- my size could right away verify the size and location of the one who feels it. The duck! There it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying duck. Each flap of its wings strikes me. But with him are four other ducks. I bring them together in my line of vision. My focal point is not one, but rather the triangle that cuts through the air. The life of each duck fades into the life of the triangle. And if I could place myself above, high above, so that I could see hundreds of groups of ducks flying and evolving, each small triangle would also fade with life and everything else, and the collection of all the ducks would look uniquely alive and vital, a unified beast, a unified life and purpose. And each group -- which is to say, each bird! -- one member, one pulsing cell, like the globules in our blood and in our entire body. <p> Higher! We must always elevate ourselves more! <p> All of these slippery stains formed beneath us by tiny black points, they are no longer the enormous solitary beast, but rather they are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch of coast and sea -- the region beneath my eyes -- pulsating, feeling, boiling. <p> And even higher? Perhaps the entire Earth would appear as one living reality. And my duck? <p> It passes by. There it goes. But it has dissolved between my fingers. <p> I have now started to jump along the rocks. As I move I am trying once again not to fix my eyes on anything so that the world will not multiply or increasingly unify. I have moved nervously through all that surrounds me, especially the ducks who I knew were passing above my head. I have gone on, feeling the urgent need to peacefully meditate on oceans, waves, puddles, and ducks, and to be able through my meditations to focus clearly on the point from where each independent life originates, or to discover that there is no such point. <p> Fine. Here in this cove there is peace. Sit, and let 's meditate. No more than a meter into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me, the same plump man who interrogated me with his eyes when I had tried to read the Quixote. <p> I will explain everything to him. <p> -- Sir.( In a circular instance I explain to him all that I had contemplated). <p> I skip over a moment full of dubious rocks. <p> -- Sir.( And at this point, as my meditations had already been verified, I tell him with a richness of detail and elegance without par, the results I had obtained. The plump man warmly congratulates me.) <p> Yes, but there is the moment on the rocks : an obligatory moment in the story. The first part is a direct observation of nature ; the other, a silent meditation. And between the two, their union, a conduit that unifies them : the moment the observation asked to be meditated upon. <p> This moment -- which in reality was accompanied by jumps on the rocks-I have to mention it to my audience. I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> -- Sir, then.( There has to be a " then. " How can it be avoided?) Then. I began to meditate. then. I thought. <p> No. It 's best not to meditate or think if to do so we have to go through this. <p> Let 's change the " then ; " this could be the cause of it all. <p> -- In the presence of this scene, sir. I could not keep myself from saying. I reflected in this way. and pondered as such. <p> Worse, worse. It looks like the problem is not in the " then " nor in the " in the presence of the scene : ' Could it be in the meditate, think, say, reflect, ponder? <p> The gap between the two moments bristled the rocks. It 's like a tax that must be paid in order to obtain the necessary permission to elucidate our lucubrations. If there is something clear to extract from what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrive. Bad, bad! Is there not some other way, a hidden path, a detour that evades the rocks? An obligation to pay our old friend " literature " with a little phrase entirely to her liking? <p> I am creating it ; better said, I continue to create it. Because I created it, to be sure, in the peaceful cove. I created it and, in the presence of this creation, I did not meditate at all, not even a hundredth of a meditation, not on oceans, nor on waves, nor on puddles, nor ducks, nor on lives as large as constellations or as small as microbes. October 1st <p> Today I returned to the edge of the sea. I have discovered a wonderful place. To get an idea of it, imagine a rock in the form of a monolith some 30-35 meters high ; place it with the waves, in such a way that they smack its base ; tint with blue sky all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of equal size and form ; put it next to the first rock, with no more than two or three meters between them ; proceed with this rock in the same way with respect to the waves and sky ; cover the space between the two rocks with sand and seashells ; sit sea birds at the top of the rocks ; throw crabs and mussels at the bottom ; surround the rocks with luche and cochayuyo leaves ; heat the rocks in the sun and meditate upon the whole scene, enraptured in admiration. <p> This is what I have done from 4 o'clock in the afternoon until 5:10. At this time, I was struck by a sudden desire : to go between the two tall monoliths, to enter the sea. Five minutes of reflection, and forward! <p> Nothing interesting about my walk ; nothing as well as I passed between the two rocks ; but one small interesting detail as I attempted to enter the sea. Here it is : <p> As I stretched out my foot to kick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the water retreated and my foot struck dry ground. Another step : the same thing. And another : the same. After seven steps, I stood still, hoping that a wave would once again emerge out of the undercurrent of the previous wave. I saw it form in the distance, I saw it come. As it came, I took another step and the same scene repeated itself. Ninth step, tenth. the same thing. Before the thirteenth attempt, I once again stood still. I only had one step left. You already know my feelings about the number 14. <p> Another wave came, the last! I burned my last step. The wave trickled away and once more I struck dry land. <p> Thus, with no more steps left, I buried myself up to my knees in the sand, and waited. <p> One minute, two minutes, three, four. Fourteen minutes, 14! <p> I heard in the air a solemn canticle : trumpets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a banjo. And the sea like me stood still during those fourteen minutes, and when it heard the canticle, it awoke and rolled away. <p> From each side, from all four cardinal points, it moved entirely towards one point on the horizon, before my eyes. And as it moved, it discovered, in my presence, its wet and scented hidden depths. <p> Watery plants with branches like the tongues of monsters stretched forward and then, when they could no longer feel the soft pressure of the sea, they exploded in aromas of iodine and salt. Thousands of creatures like spiders and as big as dogs went wild, running, smashing, and, as they discovered that there was no remedy to cure this illness, they buried their heads in the rocks and died a sweet death. Millions of fish rolled their astonished eyes ; they emitted a groan, and dissolved into gelatin. And the underwater rocks, suddenly finding themselves naked in the sun, sunk into the ground, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And the entire sea, from all sides -- I repeat -- continued to escape towards that one point, forming, as it traveled, an immense globe of water. <p> A pause. All the plants had exploded, all the creatures had died, all the fish had turned into a gelatin ; not even a stone beneath the sun. <p> Then the sea transformed its sphere over the horizon into a curtain that covered the sky and hid the light. <p> Another pause. The curtain moved up and towards the coast. What a spectacular sight! <p> I think it 's difficult for anyone to imagine this without having seen it with their own eyes. A sea, an ocean in place of the sky, ripples of foam in place of clouds, and a few displaced fish instead of seagulls and gannets. A spectacular sight! Beneath it, I was in ecstasy. The mussels swiftly opened and closed their shells, applauding like castanets ; the crabs whistled like sirens from both ends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to climb through their openings, where they stuck out their pincers and pointed them towards the enormous curtain that passed above our heads. <p> Suddenly, high up above, I noticed a red point. I fixed my eyes on it. The sea urchins, mussels, and crabs hid. The red point was falling. It was falling, and growing. It was n't a point. It was a knot of branches, of arms. It was falling. It was going to land behind me. <p> It fell past the first hills behind me. <p> It took only a second to dig out my knees ; my feet, another second. And I started to run. <p> What had fallen was a mass of coral. I sat near it, and this was what I observed : <p> As soon as it hit the ground, this mass consulted each of its individual entities, and they unanimously agreed to hold a vote of protest against all the zoophytes in the entire globe, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plant kingdom. The mass in question then grew larger and released into the air hundreds of intertwined branches, solid, shiny branches in a thousand varieties of red on white zigzags with fanciful trimmings. This is what it looked like from the ground up. <p> From the ground down it released sharp pointy roots. I directed a beam of vision at one of these roots and with it I began to descend, and I descended. <p> We passed through six different layers of earth at an outrageous speed, and when we arrived at the seventh, we stopped. The roots took a seat and asked permission to extract its nutrients. A character with a Mephistophelian face gave them all the permissions they desired. I then went back up along with the first nutritive ration. <p> I sat down, once again, in the same place and stared with astonishment at this coral tree. But something distracted me : standing beneath the tree, smiling, in a wide overcoat, a bowler hat, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plump man. He greeted me with the utmost courtesy, winked his eye and in a slow voice, said : <p> -- Good afternoon. <p> He coughed, smiled, spat, and said : <p> -- My name is Desiderio Longotoma. <p> He closed his umbrella, and continued : <p> -- My good sir : I have the pleasure of telling you that with one eye I followed the depths of your vision while with the other eye I observed you during the entire period of your ascension and descension. <p> In regards to the former, I have nothing to tell you, for you saw as much as I, although I doubt that you have understood in all their breadth the different layers of our planet, above all, the seventh. But in regards to the latter, I should inform you of the following : <p> Through the duration of your voyage -- it is more accurate to say the voyage of your vision -- you slept with your other eye, and in the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The ineffable imbecility of your expression, and the consummate cretinousness of your smile kept me from entertaining even the slightest doubts about the nature of your aforementioned dream. <p> I do not want, thus, to be at all ambiguous when I assure you that you believed with all certainty in a heavenly region that contained all that is good, noble, and beautiful in this world. <p> Nor do I wish to remain in the terrain of falsehood when I assure you that as your vision traveled through the first six layers, and especially as it spent the night in the seventh, you observed with distraction and disdain, and thus you could not refrain from -- human nature, of course -- comparing the sweetness of paradise with this layer 's Mephistophelian character and rotten decay, and concluding that you preferred the former one thousand and one times more than the latter. <p> It is extremely painful for me to refute your convictions in this respect, especially since they are so firmly rooted in your brain. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking, I must proceed by extracting from the center your fixed convictions and reestablishing balance and truth by taking what is at the top and putting it at the bottom, and putting at the bottom what is at the top. <p> Without wasting any time, now that time is pressing, I must tell you that you are correct, in every sense of the word correct, to have classified as Mephistophelian and demonic the beings and objects in the seventh layer, and as pure and celestial all that you observed when you closed your eyes and entered the heavenly vault. But I also must advise you -- and I request that you give this all of your attention -- that it is an incredible and unspeakable human error, which has occurred for centuries and centuries, to attribute an ominous tint to the subterranean beings in the seventh layer, and a benevolent tint to those beings who shine in the blue of the upper layer. <p> An error, good sir, a profound error! <p> In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of magicians have vigorously fought to create this ridiculous change of values, and they have been so successful that it can now be said, without exaggeration, that there is not a human being on Earth who does not believe that evil exists in those creatures with horns, tails, pointy eyebrows, who smell of sulphur, and who carry sharp swords ; and that good exists in what is blue, in what emits the fragrance of lilies, in what glows like quivering candles, in what gently lowers its eyelids. <p> My good sir, I repeat : an error, a profound error! <p> It is exactly the opposite. <p> Centuries ago, evil was seen in white petals, soft silk, and the gentle trill of the night air. I request that you blindly believe me. And I request, as well, that you blindly believe that neither one way of thinking nor the other is definitive : they are only paths, long and tortuous paths that in the end arrive only at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir, that your heart 's deepest desire is to go towards what is good, it pleases me greatly to inform you of the best possibilities to attain this good. <p> This tormented coral tree that takes in nutrients from the seventh layer of demons and vermin, throws, as you see, a great red shadow, which reflects all that is created and accomplished in this layer. Sit in this shadow, and when you feel that you have been inundated by its influence, contemplate, with both body and soul, your deepest thoughts, and perhaps one day you will see for yourself what is good. For not one human being has been able to meditate on this good without having first spent several years sitting in a similar shadow, or under the influence of something analogous. <p> I hope that you will be able to take the utmost advantage of the wise advice that I, your most faithful and revered servant and friend, have given to you. I look forward to seeing you again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Desiderio Longotoma. <p> That said, he finished his good-byes, opened his umbrella, and left. <p> And now I sit, beneath this tormented and magnificent tree, and meditate on his wise words. November 1st <p> Today I had surgery on my ear and telephone. Doctor Huala, in person, administered the chloroform and scalpel. <p> This is how the events took place : <p> For quite some time I have loved Camila, wildly. She loves me one day out of every eight, and during the remaining days she laughs at me, wildly, and there is as much wildness in her laughter as there is in my love. <p> For the past seventeen days, however, Camila 's laughter has gone beyond all previous wildness to the point where today I returned to my house with a greater desire to die than to live. But before putting an end to my existence, I dialed her telephone number(n3) and listened. <p> A few seconds later, Camila spoke. By the tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one day out of every eight. But then I experienced a cruel deception. I said : <p> -- I love you, Camila! Camila, I love you! She responded with a quick little laugh, a sharp laugh, which jabbed into me like the sting of a rattlesnake. <p> -- My Camila, have mercy -- I shouted three times. <p> And her laughter only grew louder. <p> Overcome with anger, I tried with an abrupt and decisive gesture to yank the receiver from my ear, and to decisively cut off all communication between us. But just as I began this gesture, I felt a strong pain throughout my ear, as though it were being pulled by thousands of demons. At the same time, her laughter continued to pierce me with a sharpness that bristled my nerves. <p> -- Camila, I beg you, stop laughing. <p> In vain. Her laughter now echoed interminably. <p> -- Camila, it would be better if you told me you hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove the receiver from my ear. It resisted in such a way that I understood that if I kept trying I would knock over the base to which it was mounted. I tried to pull it away with a gentle touch. Useless. I tried to unscrew it like a bolt. Also useless. And her inexhaustible laughter kept pouring out, and spreading across my head. What could I do? <p> There was only one thing to do : reach for the scissors to cut the cord. I did n't care if the phone was stuck to my ear as long as I did n't have to hear her cold and scornful laughter. <p> I gave the cord a snip and split it in two. Salvation! <p> But no! Her loud and copious laughter kept coming. <p> I ran through the house. Sweet remedy! <p> Silence. As soon as I was a few meters from the phone, silence. <p> What a relief! I would no longer be tortured by that diabolical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. No longer would that symbol of my unfortunate love continue to enter in through my auditory nerve. Silence, silence. But soon I began to notice that, in truth, there was too much silence. <p> Not even a whisper, or a murmur, or a muffled echo, nothing. My feet on the floorboards stepped on cotton ; when I clapped my hands, not even one wave of sound was released into the air ; when I screamed at the top of my lungs, my voice was an underground vault. Complete silence. <p> Terrified, I picked up a bottle of wine from the Rhine Valley and threw it against the bathroom mirror : the bottle shattered, the wine flew through the air, and the mirror was pulverized. All of this in the silence of a cloudless night over a snowy and deserted mountaintop. The peace of a tomb, an absolute peace. A perfect suppression of any manifestation of all auricular life. <p> I wo n't deny it : I turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me from the side of existence on which all other human beings live. <p> Nevertheless, a hope. With cautious steps, I walked towards the room with the telephone. Silence, an ever-present silence. <p> I arrived. I stopped three meters from the phone, and leaned against the wall. Each minute a drop of blood dripped from the severed phone cord. But not a sound nor a whisper, nothing. <p> I walked no faster than the minute hand on the clock. Silence. <p> Silence, yes, throughout the entire interminable first meter. <p> Until I arrived at the very beginning of the second meter. <p> Then, from far away, at an extraordinary distance, I heard, faintly but at the same time with clarity, a jingling, which, because of its distance, made me think of antipodes ; it sounded like crystal shards on ice. <p> I kept walking. The jingling grew louder. Now it sounded like a voice draining the house, soaking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape, vibrates, bounces off the walls. My destiny is marked : defenseless, subdued, I take the last step. And I am nearly deafened by the wounding sound of Camila 's sarcastic laughter. <p> No more precaution, no more deliberation. I jump from one side to the other : towards the telephone, away from it ; towards the piercing laughter, then towards the absolute silence. O the incessant scorn from my one and only love, o the silent abyss between myself and the world. <p> And the days begin to pass, outside of my eardrums. <p> Monotonous days, exactly the same. <p> I sleep well, and I wake up at the same time as always, but I feel three times more tired than before, now that one of the three ways of sleeping is no longer available to me : I can sleep on my back, and on one side, but the telephone receiver stuck to my ear prevents me from sleeping on the other. <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the remaining pieces of my broken mirror. I test out all the possible methods of taking the phone off my ear : force, subtlety, a knife, a lubricant. No success. <p> I walk with soft steps through each room of the house and, from time to time, I entertain myself -- the only entertainment possible -- by verifying and re-verifying -- until I am properly sated -- that everything becomes silent in my presence. <p> I then walk to the telephone, always with the naive and distant hope that silence will have penetrated its domain. No! Camila 's laughter is always there, entrenched in the machine, and suspended in several meters of the surrounding air. <p> I return to my study. I put a record on the phonograph and, as always, I comfortably settle into my armchair. Each day, I like to experience the great pleasure -- unavailable to others -- of knowing that in the entire room there is sound, even when I do n't hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I close my eyes, and meditate, and on each occasion -- like clouds of smoke taking shape, or like small shapes swimming in the clouds -- I sense that another interpretation of the silent world is beginning to form, an interpretation useless to anyone who can hear. Another face, another meaning, another reason, which only begins to form when the silence is definitive unto eternity. <p> But then I remember that for me this is n't the case. For if on one side I do not hear, I hear -- and do I hear! -- the moment my receiver enters the zone occupied by Camila 's laughter. <p> Maybe this time there will be silence? <p> My hope is revived, a double hope : no longer to hear her wretched laughter ; and to walk unblemished through my new perceptions of this insinuated world. <p> I run to the telephone. I extend my neck. And tilt the receiver. <p> Camila laughs, Camila laughs, jingles and drives ice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene repeats itself. The phonograph spins another record. <p> It 's like this every day, every hour. Either the tomb, or the scorn of Camila. <p> Slowly the habit possessed me. My entire organism adapted to this new mode of existence. The tomb filled with silent meanings ; the laughter infiltrated me with the pleasure of suffering. A sweet and sorrowful happiness came more and more to take the place of my previous activities. Thousands of objects which hid from my intimate life beneath the ever-echoing sounds of existence now obediently presented themselves to me like delicate gifts. All the empty space that surrounded me became populated with unsuspected existences. And over this new world, the suffocating pleasure of torment that Camilla inflicted upon me absorbed like pepper in my flesh. <p> It 's been three days since I told myself that, from this point on, I will be happy until the end of my life. But yesterday, doctor Huala appeared at my door. <p> The good man had been informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- and up until recently, I -- considered to be my disgrace. I told him there was no disgrace. But he would n't listen to me. He went to the window and opened it wide. With thousands of faces and gestures, he led me to understand that the entire outside world, all that could be seen of the city, the distant mountains, and the sky, was infinitely flowing with living sounds. <p> The good man tempted me. He has tempted me. I tilted my head. <p> Today he has come ; he has operated on me, and chloroformed me. Afterwards, he reconnected the receiver to the bloody, hanging cord. And today I once again heard the sounds of life. <p> And all of the unsuspected existences, and all of my peaceful meditations have vanished. And all of the pleasure in pain has disappeared. Now everything echoes frantically. And so to know what to expect in this world which provokes in me an infernal chaos, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dial 52061, and wait. December 1st <p> Today I returned from a long trip. A few days after the operation, and at the advice of Doctor Huala, I boarded in Valparaiso the S.S. Orangutan of the H. T. T. K. C. <p> We stopped at the following ports : <p> Coquimbo. -- A cheerful and picturesque town in the middle of a large and peaceful bay. Coquimbo is known as the land of coconut and cherry trees. Everything here is born, grows, lives, fructifies, and dies in accordance with the cherry and coconut trees. What does not follow this line is immediately picked up by the police and thrown into the sea with a stone tied to its neck, and if it does not have a neck, then the stone is tied to its most prominent part. During our stay we had occasion to see two definitive submersions : a) a German scholar who had the nerve to declare in front of the country 's elite that the study of extra-sclerotic orbital pterygoidal worms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherry tree regardless of how many of them there were in Coquimbo ; and b) a mattress which had innocently torn a bit of its fabric, and exposed its contents to the eyes of the authorities : cotton stuffing, and not the coconut filament or cherry sawdust found in all the other mattresses of the city. <p> Aside from those acts which offended our sensibilities as Santiaguinos, the rest of our stay in Coquimbo was wonderful, absolutely wonderful. <p> Wherever we looked and in any way that we looked, our eyes fell on a coconut tree guarded by two cherry trees, and the only variation to this ineffable scene was the rare occasion on which there was one cherry tree guarded by two coconut trees. <p> In fact our enchantment with Coquimbo became so unbearable that the Captain decided to set sail without any further delay. <p> Antofagasta. -- A cheerful and picturesque town in the middle of a large and peaceful bay. A city that has left us with inerasable memories -- for a city entirely of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, wool streets, wool trees, and wool people. And from time to time, a famished fakir, entangled in wool, comes to the city, and yawns. <p> So much peace in that woolen sky. The residents of Antofagasta contemplate the sky by raising their woolen pupils. They subtly alter the name of their beloved " An-to-fa-ga-sta, " and fall into ecstasy at the thought of how in the past, everything -- because it was not made of wool -- deteriorated, and how now -- now that everything is made of wool -- nothing deteriorates. Then they tune all of the instruments in the region to the key of F, and with these instruments -- always in F -- they sing, swaying until the sun sets in the west, leaving in its place the taste of astronomical wool. <p> Iquique. -- A cheerful and picturesque town in the middle of a large and peaceful bay. But how different it is from the previous two cities, almost as though it did not belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the cradle, the universal cradle, of all the birds in the world whose song is shrill and hesitant. <p> Any bird that sings like this, and who did not see the light of day in this land will not survive : it will surely be eaten by serpents, scorpions, tarantulas, and other bacteria. The birds, in contrast, that were born here -- and who later take off in fast flight through the five parts of the globe -- make it to old age, make it to a ripe old age, to that old age without feathers, without wings or beaks, though always with their exquisite song, their sharp and stunning song. <p> The people who live here try to imitate these notes. And with good reason. The sound they release into the air is so enchanting that ten minutes before anchoring all of the passengers aboard the Orangutan began to chirp like these pretty birds. When the captain heard us, he silenced our deafening whistles with the ship 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mollendo. -- A cheerful and picturesque town in the middle of a large and peaceful bay. But this town is completely different. <p> In Mollendo, everything is round, cottony, and brown. And moreover everything is soft and cushy, so much so that its residents recline anywhere and everywhere, wherever they happen to feel drowsy : on a branch, on a rock, in a chimney, on the ocean 's waves, absolutely anywhere. <p> Then they eat. The only thing they eat are earthy-tasting round rolls. Afterwards, they rinse their hands in the sea, and since the water is brown, and since the bread crumbs are also brown, with each rinse of the hands, Mollejo becomes more and more brown. And with the earthy wind that blows here every night, and with the lazy licks of the waves, Mollendo becomes more and more round. <p> The captain has told me that within a few years this entire place will be one round, cottony ball the color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and picturesque town in the middle of a large and peaceful bay. It is also an extremely curious port. It is formed by mountains of transparent salt, just like those salty stones that are licked by cows. The sea, when it reflects these mountains, turns a glaucous color. <p> The people who live here -- it goes without saying -- are like people everywhere, except that when they cross these mountains they acquire strange forms, like frail little figures. <p> As the ship came to anchor, it left behind a trail of colorless, featureless spittle. We watched with dying eyes as glaucous as the sea. <p> Pacasmayo. -- A cheerful and picturesque town in the middle of a large and peaceful bay. But what a difference from the previous towns! What a contrast! What crazy colors! Every imaginable color and many other colors which perhaps I could not see were in the leaves and the fruits of its trees. And each color was bright, vibrant, definitive. A crazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the thick sea was like oil colors ; it moved slowly, and it tinged the hull of the ship with a rainbow that detached itself as we traveled. The sailors would dip a finger in these colors, then suck on it happily. And the strangest thing about this curious port was that a parrot could be seen in each tree, in each branch, in each fruit. <p> All of the parrots screamed at the same time and without even one second of interruption. The noise was so loud that during the twenty hours of our stay we communicated through sign language because we could not hear a word. <p> As we sailed away, Pacasmayo looked like a giant blaze with fiery tongues of red, yellow, green, and orange, which moved and twisted as a bit of wind swayed the branches of the trees and the feathers of the parrots. <p> We heard from the blaze the bitter cry of the birds ; and later we heard an out of tune murmur that lasted until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parrots were silent. <p> Pimentel. -- A cheerful and picturesque town in the middle of a large and peaceful bay. But quite different from the previous town. <p> A splendid Nile green plain, endless, with thousands, millions of trees, equidistant one to the other. Their trunks stood straight as pins ; their leaves were round and almost black, The captain himself told me that these trees produced pepper. Once he said that, we both started to sneeze loudly. <p> During the three days we were anchored here, we saw nothing : not one dog on the street, nor one fish in the water, nor one bird in the air. Bored, the captain gave orders to lift anchor, and the Orangutan set sail. <p> Patia. -- A cheerful and picturesque town in the middle of a large and peaceful bay. Enormous, low-hanging green leaves, which tilt towards the earth, forming blue hollows. <p> The people from Patia recline in the hollows, lazily humming a tune. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the bright blue sea, which flows beneath the leaves. A sea that has no horizon, for where the horizon should appear, the leaves mask everything. <p> Out of curiosity, I picked up a leaf. I too could not see the horizon, but a mountain that hid the horizon appeared, and came closer and closer to me. A mountain that surrounded the entire sea. It was a metallic cherry red, exactly the color of an avocado pit. This cherry red was reflected in short though numerous rays on the bright blue water. The captain told me that the mountain was actually made of metal and that from its base it emitted and scattered liquid into the sea. In response to this, I let go of a leaf and once again the green saturated it. My response was completely useless. <p> Manta. -- A cheerful and picturesque town in the middle of a large and peaceful bay. <p> This town has three inhabitants who rotate the responsibility of completing the three necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the second sleeps, and the third one eats. Afterwards, the one who keeps guard sleeps, the one who sleeps eats, and the one who eats keeps guard. And this, successively, until infinity. <p> The one who keeps guard sits atop a pine tree ; he salutes the passing ships ; he runs to greet those ships that anchor, and he shakes the hands of important officials, passengers, and the crew. <p> The one who sleeps lies in a red tent. He sleeps deeply, and dreams -- always the same dream -- unhappily, of the beauty and grandeur of Guayaquil. <p> The one who eats squats behind a bush. He sticks out his hand and grabs a gannet. He eats it alive, with its beak, its feet, its feathers, every part of it. The bird lets out blood-curdling cries. <p> In effect. Not even an hour after we anchored our ears were drilled with the most horrible, the most frightful howl that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that scream scared the other birds in the area, especially the other gannets : the sky filled with hundreds of thousands of birds overcome with fear. And amongst them were the sad and serene brothers of the victim, majestically beating their wings, as bitter tears fell from their eyes. <p> One of these birds, distracted from its path by the smell, did not fly over the bay, but instead landed on the porthole of my cabin. <p> The voice of alarm instantaneously traveled from one end of the ship to the other. <p> -- Gannet on board! Gannet on board! <p> The flag of danger was then raised atop the mizzenmast ; from the foremast, the flag of resignation flew in the face of evil. And the siren cried lugubriously, as the two anchors, without having been hoisted by anyone, rose pitifully to the deck like two drenched old ladies. <p> The captain grew grave and sullen. His only words were : <p> -- Return. <p> Creaking from its core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the horizon. <p> How sad it was to come so suddenly to the end of our trip! What a disappointment! And to think that we were only miles from our final destination, the port of Buenaventura, which, according to public opinion, is a cheerful and picturesque town in the middle of a large and peaceful bay. <p> But there was nothing to be done. The captain had said " return " and the Orangutan meekly obeyed. <p> Describing a wide circle in the ocean, we returned without docking at any ports. And today, with great joy, we saw once again atop its hills the cheerful and picturesque town of Valparaiso, whitening the middle of its large and peaceful bay. <p> I spent the days of our return locked in my cabin, lying on my bunk, without seeing anyone, without eating or moving a limb. Behind me, and above my head, sat the gannet of Manta, slowly flitting its wings. This was how I dreamed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I happily filtered those distant memories that struck my mind, and how I colored in yellow and green those projects for next year that began to germinate and flutter to the rhythm of the ocean 's waves. <p> And in this way, the noble bird accompanied me, day after day, hour after hour, without screaming, or even batting an eyelid, only flitting in silence his soft cotton wings. <p> And as I set foot on land, I watched the bird fly into the distance, then launch beak-first into the water behind a catfish, who swam slowly behind a sea flea. <p> And we never saw each other again. December 31st <p> Today I slowly and carefully reread this diary. I have no doubts : it must be good for this very simple reason : <p> Each day begins with " Today I. " followed by a participle. <p> " Today I awoke, had, have, crossed, experienced, wandered, lived, came, returned, had, returned, reread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way -- I assure you -- is touched by perfection, for it fulfills the inviolable law -- the sacred law! -- that has been promulgated by every young girl who has poured out her feelings with ink on paper, and by all the wise professors of grammar and rhetoric. <p> Amen.
