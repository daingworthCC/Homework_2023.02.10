4170441 Headnote # Abstract. Theories of legal interpretation have taken a " positive turn " in recent years. Some scholars have argued that disputes over how to interpret statutes and the Constitution should be resolved by looking to the social facts that determine what our positive law requires. Most of the commentary on the positive turn has focused on the substantive claim that what the law requires as a matter of constitutional interpretation is a version of originalism. Less attention has been paid to the more interesting and provocative methodological thesis that we ought to resolve our debates about legal interpretation by looking to " our law " and that doing so requires making claims about the nature of law-specifically, claims about the social facts that determine its content. # Because positivist theories vary with respect to which social facts matter for the purpose of determining the existence and content of law, an obvious( and obviously important) question for the positive turn is whether generating its alleged methodological benefits requires choosing from among rival positivist theories. Yet the chief proponents of the positive turn say very little on this question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This Article thus sets out to answer that question by testing how the positive turn would work under four different positivist accounts of law. The result of the analysis is that the positive turn fails under every approach considered. Although certain aspects of the positive turn fit well with each account of law, not one of those accounts is capable of supporting it. Instead, each approach either leads to obviously false conclusions or fails to produce the normative and methodological payoff the positive turn promises. Even in its failure, however, the positive turn is instructive because it illustrates the difficulty of endeavoring to reconcile legal theory and practice. # Introduction # " Pick up a copy of any law review that you see and the first article is likely to be, you know, the influence of Immanuel Kant on evidentiary approaches in eighteenth-century Bulgaria, or something, which I 'm sure was of great interest to the academic that wrote it, but is n't of much help to the bar. " # -Chief Justice John G. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice Roberts made the comment above, suggesting that much contemporary legal scholarship is unhelpful to the bench and bar, he provoked a fierce reaction from the legal academy.2 Two of the Chief Justice 's former clerks, however, seem to have taken their former boss 's critique of legal scholarship to heart. In a series of articles, William Baude and Stephen E. Sachs have advanced an agenda for public law scholarship, an agenda that has been dubbed the " positive turn. " 3 The core idea of the positive turn is that debates about how to properly interpret statutes and the Constitution ought to be settled neither by analyzing concepts of meaning, interpretation, or authority nor by engaging in normative debates sounding in political or moral philosophy. Instead, scholars should look to the same source lawyers and judges do to resolve legal disagreements : the law. Since both the existence and content of law are determined by certain facts about our legal system, scholars should devote their energies to figuring out what those facts tell us about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at those law-determining facts, you can see that, for instance, what the law requires as a matter of constitutional interpretation is originalism.4 # The positive turn has seized the attention of constitutional theorists, quickly generating a flurry of commentary-much of it critical.5 Most of the criticism has focused on the authors ' substantive claim that our law is best described as originalist.6 Yet the authors candidly acknowledge the limits of their substantive claim that originalism is our law.7 What they really care about, they each emphasize, is the methodological thesis that we should resolve interpretive debates by reference to what " our law " is, whether or not they happen to be right that originalism is our law.8 Lest there remain any doubt about these ambitions, Baude and Sachs subsequently coauthored another article in the Harvard Law Review in which they broaden the argument to include methods of statutory interpretation, in addition to constitutional interpretation, and again frame their argument largely in methodological terms.9 # This methodological thesis, which is the essence of the positive turn, is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. This perplexity arises from the fact that the claim seems at once banal and inventive. How is it that an argument that scholars should look to the law to settle scholarly debates could possibly be a methodological innovation? Have not law professors always argued about what the law requires? Yet the authors do seem to be saying something interesting and provocative. But what, exactly? # The answer lies in two core insights of the positive turn : The first is the observation that " our law " not only substantively regulates our social, economic, and political life but may also speak to second-order questions about how judges should determine the meaning of such substantive law.10 Second, as its label suggests, Baude and Sachs tie their claim about what the law requires to one about the nature of law, namely that its existence and content are primarily, if not exclusively, a matter of positive, empirical fact.11 # The promise and appeal of the positive turn, then, may lie in its apparent capacity to bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chief Justice 's comment highlights.12 It does so in two ways : On the one hand, it suggests that turning to legal practice( " our law ") can help resolve, or at least reorient, our scholarly debates about how to interpret our Constitution and statutes. On the other hand, it suggests that deep questions of legal theory or philosophy may shed light on what legal practice requires. Theory and practice are brought together again in an ingenious sort of way. # This second insight, about the role of legal philosophy, however, remains largely undeveloped. Baude and Sachs insist that the law depends on " the right kind " of social facts13 or " modern social facts, " 14 but they do not say much about what those facts are or how we would know them when we see them. At times they suggest that we can know roughly which facts matter by relying on " lawyers ' assumptions rather than technical jurisprudence. " 15 At other times, they characterize it as an issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be left for another day.16 At still other times, they seem to commit themselves to one particular theory of law, namely that of H.L.A. Hart.17 For Hart, the relevant social facts are the current practices of courts, so that may be one answer to the question which social facts matter.18 But then the authors quickly clarify that they rely on Hart partly for " ease of exposition " because, in reality, " much of our framework should hold true on any mainstream theory. " 19 # The ambiguity on this point matters because legal positivists have long debated which facts are the important ones in determining the existence and content of law.20 So it is fair to ask whether the positive turn will generate its purported methodological benefits irrespective of which theory of law is employed to determine the relevant social facts. There is a world of difference between the claim A that a given theory 's success depends on how one resolves a controversial issue that will be temporarily bracketed and the claim B that the theory succeeds irrespective of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an admission of the theory 's dependence on controversial matters( and hence a theoretical vice), B is an assertion of its independence( and hence a theoretical virtue). # The aim of this Article, therefore, is to see how the positive turn fares under a few different well-known positivist accounts of law. The hope is that it will not only reveal something about the positive turn 's true methodological payoff, or lack thereof, but also yield some insight into the motivations and ambitions behind it. # Examining how the positive turn would work under a variety of jurisprudential approaches demonstrates why the promise of the positive turn is more apparent than real. The turn achieves an air of novelty and plausibility only because the authors are ambiguous, evasive, or downright inconsistent about some of the deepest questions about the nature of law-questions about the relationship between legal validity and judicial practice, about the nature and implications of judicial disagreement, and about the criteria for theory choice among philosophies of law. These are hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions that have, in part, set the course of jurisprudential debate at least since Hart published The Concept of Law in 1961.21 Yet the authors write as if those debates never happened-as if the questions were never raised, let alone answers to them offered and challenged. The result is that what they present as a methodological advance in fact takes us back to some of the foundational debates about the nature of law and legal argument. The positive turn is really a U-turn. # Still, even in its failure, the positive turn is instructive. All of the various ambiguities and tensions one finds in the authors ' arguments for and applications of the positive turn reduce to one fundamental tension concerning the nature and function of legal scholarship. That tension is the one mentioned at the outset between the demands of legal theory and those of legal practice. It may seem that the authors ' ambition to reconcile these twin demands is futile, and the confusions that plague the positive turn might seem to give grounds for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrary, I respect the authors ' ambition( if I understand it correctly) to show both that legal philosophy matters for law and that law itself can be a source of intellectual guidance rather than just a set of rules and institutions to be analyzed from the perspective of some other discipline. Thus, this Article suggests-albeit only briefly-a somewhat different approach to meeting the same challenge, one that rejects the distinction, now so entrenched in legal scholarship, between " internal " and " external " accounts of law.22 # The rest of this Article supports these broad claims. Part I first summarizes the three main applications of the positive turn. It then reveals the common syllogistic structure to which all three applications conform, which I call the " Core Argument. " The Core Argument holds that for any given interpretive rule, that rule counts as law( and thereby imposes a duty on courts to apply it) if it is supported by the kind of social facts that determine the content of law. The positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should evaluate the propriety of interpretive rules by seeing how well they fare under the Core Argument. # Part II, which constitutes the bulk of the Article, shows why the promise of the positive turn evaporates under scrutiny. It shows this by testing the Core Argument under four jurisprudential approaches. The first three correspond to the theoretical accounts of law advanced by H.L.A. Hart, Joseph Raz, and Scott Shapiro.23 The fourth approach is one that makes no claims at all about the nature of law, resting instead on " lawyers ' assumptions rather than technical jurisprudence. " 24 As Part II shows, certain elements of the positive turn fit well with some aspects of each of these approaches but less well with others. This result is just what one would expect because, as noted above, these accounts of law developed in part as responses to difficulties of precisely the sort raised by the authors ' arguments. # In a very brief Conclusion, I suggest an alternative path for pursuing the authors ' scholarly ambitions-or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. The Positive Turn at Work # The best way to understand the positive turn is to see it in action. This Part begins by showing how it has been applied to debates in constitutional and statutory interpretation.25 In separately written papers, Baude and Sachs have each argued that a positive analysis supports particular versions of constitutional originalism. More recently, they have together endorsed taking the same approach to answer questions about statutory and constitutional interpretation more generally. After briefly summarizing each of these arguments, it will be relatively easy to see the Core Argument, which underlies all of them and whose defense constitutes the central thesis of the positive turn. # A.Inclusive Originalism # William Baude argues that debates about originalism have been too focused on conceptual questions about the nature of meaning or authority and normative questions about whether or why originalism promotes democracy, constrains judges, or enhances welfare.26 Given that most people agree that judges have at least a prima facie obligation to apply the law, the relevant question ought to be : What is our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceptually confused or normatively problematic, if that method is required by law, then it occupies a privileged position over its competitors.28 Baude then argues that " inclusive originalism " occupies that privileged position.29 # Inclusive originalism describes the view that " the original meaning of the Constitution is the ultimate criterion for constitutional law, including of the validity of other methods of interpretation or decision. " 30 Under this view, the validity of a rule, whether substantive or interpretive, is determined by whether the original meaning of the Constitution either incorporates the rule or at least permits the rule.31 For instance, the Eighth Amendment might incorporate through the phrase " cruel and unusual punishments " the Court 's doctrine prohibiting death sentences for crimes committed while the defendant was a minor.32 Crucially, then, inclusive originalism authorizes a court to look to other sources of law to resolve ambiguities in the text if and only if the original Constitution included such methods.33 Baude suggests that such is the case with the doctrine of stare decisis.34 Thus, " it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 35 Still, the key point is that for the inclusive originalist, original meaning is not simply one of many legitimate sources of law. Rather, because it is the source of the authority of other methods, such as precedent or tradition, it is, methodologically speaking, " first among equals. " 36 # Baude next argues that inclusive originalism best describes our law because it is reflected in both our " higher-order practices "( widespread conventions about how we treat the Founding era) and our " lower-order practices "( the explicit reasoning of Supreme Court decisions).37 With respect to our higherorder practices, Baude observes that we revere the Constitution and accept the authority of the Framers ; 38 we generally treat the law as being continuous since the Founding, only recognizing a change in the law if that change has been brought about lawfully( as opposed to by revolution) ; 39 and we generally agree about how to decide the " easy cases " of constitutional law, such as how to select the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our lower-order practices also point to inclusive originalism. Indeed, those Supreme Court decisions that remain canonical or " fixed stars " of our constitutional law reflect many interesting facts indicative of inclusive originalism.41 First, the Court generally begins with the original meaning of a constitutional provision and only draws on other sources, such as practice, after finding ambiguity as to textual meaning.42 Second, if there is a conflict between the textual meaning of a provision and another source of law, the text always wins.43 Third, when the Court overturns precedent, it typically does so on originalist grounds, enabling the Court to say plausibly that the overruled case was " wrong the day it was decided. " 44 Finally, one sees that the Court never contradicts inclusive originalism.45 Even famous, seemingly antioriginalist cases like Brown v. Board of Education, 46 Gideon v. Wainwright, 47 Miranda v. Arizona, 48 Roe v. Wade, 49 and, more recently, Obergefell v. Hodges, 50 when properly interpreted, are " consistent with inclusive originalem. " 51 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply the law( as most agree they do) and if inclusive originalism is our law, then it follows that judges have a duty to practice inclusive originalism.52 # B.Original-Law Originalism # Like Baude, Stephen Sachs argues that debates about originalism have been too consumed with conceptual and normative questions.53 He emphasizes the need for and value of " positive " defenses of constitutional originalism, which assert that " originalism, as a matter of social fact and legal practice, is actually endorsed by our positive law. " 54 He then offers " original-law originalism " as a form of originalism reflected in current practice.55 # Original-law originalism interprets originalism as a " theory of legal change " rather than a theory of constitutional interpretation.56 In particular, this view holds that " our law is still the Founders ' law, as it has been lawfully changed. " 57 According to Sachs, " lawful changes " include only those changes made by the application of a " rule of change " that was itself valid at the time of the Founding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @.58 # Sachs seeks to show that our " higher-order " practices are committed to original-law originalism by pointing to various features of conventional legal reasoning that seem to assume this view.59 For one thing, we do not trace the pedigree of legal rules to a period before the Founding.60 Instead, we take the Founding as the crucial event in our legal history and understand today 's law as continuous from the law of the Founding.61 In other words, we( that is, courts) assume that the law at the time of the Founding is still our law today unless it was changed through some legally valid method.62 # According to Sachs, there are three primary ways in which we recognize our law to have changed validly since the Founding. First, it may be that a general term used in the Constitution incorporates something that itself changes( such as what is required for " the public Safety " under the Suspension Clause63) or is stated in sufficiently broad terms that the application of the term changes over time( such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @).65 # Second, the Constitution may be changed through the application of a rule of change that is valid because it existed as law at the time of the Founding.66 The paradigmatic instance of this kind of rule is Article V 's amendment procedure, but there may be other, subtler forms of authorized legal change.67 For example, it may be that under the Founders ' law, a " regular course of practice " could " liquidate &amp; settle the meaning " of an ambiguous provision of the constitutional text.68 # The third and final way the Founders ' law can be validly changed( according to current law) is through what Sachs calls " domesticating doctrines. " 69 Domesticating doctrines validate ex post what were initially unauthorized changes to a legal right or rule.70 These doctrines thus enable courts to treat a legal claim " as if " it were legally valid even though courts recognize that, in some sense, it is not.71 Stare decisis is the most important example of a domesticating doctrine in the constitutional context. Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Founders or " has been lawfully added since, " the Court 's use of it to legitimize even erroneous decisions counts as valid legal change.72 So even if the use of paper money, for instance, would have been unconstitutional at the Founding, if it has been ratified as precedent, then it counts as valid law.73 # In short, Sachs argues that our law cares about the historical pedigree of our rules-even the interpretive ones. Thus, " if we ca n't say when things have changed, that makes it harder to explain how they changed, which makes us less confident that they 've changed. " 74 And this is true even if there have been earlier periods in our history when our law did not have the same concern with tracing the pedigree of our rules to the Founders ' law.75 # C.The Law of Interpretation # In their most recent, jointly authored piece, The Law of Interpretation, Baude and Sachs turn their sights to interpretive methods more generally, particularly methods of statutory construction.76 They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two untenable positions about the meaning of statutes. The first is what the authors call, following Mark Greenberg, " the standard picture. " 77 Under this view, the legal content of a statutory provision is fully determined by the linguistic meaning of the statute 's text.78 Other scholars, skeptical of the idea that texts have single determinate meanings, insist that judges must make recourse to normative values( for instance, democratic or rule-of-law values) to pick out one meaning from among several and thereby establish the statute 's legal content.79 # Baude and Sachs argue for a third way. They concede that the skeptics are right that the text alone does not determine the legal content of a statutory provision, but they deny that judges must-or generally do-rely directly on normative values.80 Instead, the law may direct them to apply interpretive rules to particular texts.81 And there are in fact such interpretive rules in the law-what they call the " law of interpretation. " 82 Much of their article is thus devoted to surveying this interpretive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example, the repeal-revival rule) 83 but much more of which is unwritten law( for instance, the rule of lenity and other canons of construction).84 Still, it is law nonetheless and therefore offers a source of legal determinacy that does not depend on the implausible assumption that statutory texts alone produce determinate meaning.85 # According to Baude and Sachs, recognizing the existence of this law of interpretation " clarifies two of the hoariest and hottest debates " about legal interpretation : the debates about the proper role of canons of construction in statutory interpretation and about the proper role of constitutional " construction " in constitutional adjudication.86 # With respect to the first debate, 87 the law of interpretation provides a framework for " answering endless questions about why the canons have authority and which putative canons are valid or not. " 88 Invoking a familiar distinction in statutory interpretation, they argue that whereas " linguistic " canons derive their validity from their ability to accurately track linguistic usage, what they call " legal " canons are justified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 89 Specifically, the validity of legal canons " turns on the recognized legal practices of those who constitute the legal system( perhaps including judges, officials, lawyers, or the legally educated public), and on inferences from these practices that the participants themselves might not have drawn. " 90 In other words, if judges usually invoke a given canon of construction in a particular kind of case, then that canon properly counts as part of our law. # The second debate Baude and Sachs purport to clarify is the one surrounding the " **27;12860;TOOLONG " distinction in constitutional theory.91 The basic idea of this distinction is that the first task of constitutional interpretation is to decipher the linguistic content of a particular constitutional provision.92 This is a factual or historical question. But if that linguistic content is vague or ambiguous, then the interpreter must engage in " construction, " requiring her to fix the provision 's legal meaning by reference to other sources of law, including moral or political values.93 # Although the authors consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they empathize with its critics who see it as a license for judges to engage in open-ended construction based on their own values.94 The reader can likely guess how the authors resolve the conflict : # When there 's a question about the law that the Constitution made, the right place to turn is n't to just any construction, but to the particular construction prescribed by law. Call it original methods, call it a form of construction ; our point is that linguistic content must be processed through law.95 # D.The Core Argument # Each of these three arguments takes the same basic structure, which- borrowing from Sachs 's own schema-can be formalized as the following pair of syllogisms. I call these syllogisms the Core Argument : #? Major Premise( MP) : The law is whatever is supported by the right kind of social facts. #? minor premise( mp) : X interpretive rule or method is supported by the right kind of social facts. #? Conclusion 1 : Therefore, X interpretive rule or method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) : Judges have a prima facie duty to apply the law. #? Conclusion 2 : Therefore, judges have a prima facie duty to apply X interpretive rule or method.96 # The Core Argument is a way to determine, for any given interpretive rule X, whether X is the proper rule for judges to apply in a given context.97 The " positive turn " may then be understood as a methodological thesis asserting that applying the Core Argument is the proper way for scholars of statutory and constitutional interpretation( and judges) to determine whether any given interpretive rule has the status of law and should thus be used by judges. # Formalizing the Core Argument in this way reveals both the scope of Baude and Sachs 's ambitions and why most of their critics have scarcely challenged those ambitions. As stated in the Introduction, Baude and Sachs profess a stronger commitment to the methodological thesis than to any particular application of it.98 The purported benefits of their approach are twofold. First, the Core Argument offers a way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more generally, to enable fundamentally factual or " legal " arguments to generate normative conclusions.99 One only has to accept the relatively uncontroversial P3( that judges have at least a prima facie duty to apply the law).100 Second, the Core Argument offers more fertile and promising terrain for scholarly debate about interpretive questions because it focuses scholarly attention on traditional legal sources and redirects it away from heady conceptual questions or controversial normative debates.101 The Core Argument thus " clears away some theoretical underbrush " 102 with the hope that doing so will " allow both sides to move forward. " 103 # Despite these methodological ambitions, most of the positive turn 's critics have focused on only one of the many possible minor premises, namely one where X = originalism. Some have argued that the positive turn 's versions of originalism are too capacious to be of any interest.104 Others have denied that they offer plausible readings of the case law.105 Still others suggest that they put too much stock in judicial rhetoric.106 An entirely different line of attack questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguments in the way it seems to assume, thereby questioning the adequacy of P3 to solve the dead hand problem.107 # Such criticisms are valid and important. But the most serious potential problem with the Core Argument is its( first) major premise, MP, which states that " the law is whatever is supported by the right kind of social facts. " 108 Plainly, much hangs on defining the " right kind of social facts. " 109 For unless or until that phrase is given concrete meaning, the Core Argument is empty. The label " positive " implies that the facts are meant to be nonmoral facts or what Mark Greenberg calls " descriptive facts, " to be contrasted with moral or " value facts. " 110 And they are typically dubbed " social " facts to indicate that they are facts about how groups of certain individuals behave. So that is a start. But, as already noted, legal positivists have disagreed about which descriptive social facts determine law 's content and existence.111 Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rules laid down by courts? 113 About the practices of officials? 114 About the intentions of, or the actions taken by, a legal system 's planners? 115 Without knowing which facts are the law-determining ones, judges can not know which interpretive rules they are under a legal obligation to apply. Nor can scholars know how to begin the process of asking which interpretive rules are part of " our law. " # So how do we know which social facts require attending to? Does it even matter? If it does matter, what kind of inquiry does answering those questions involve? Remarkably, Baude and Sachs provide no clear answers to these questions.116 It is remarkable because if it turns out that the content of MP makes a difference as to whether the Core Argument can produce its supposed benefits, then one 's choice of jurisprudential theory is critical to the positive turn. And if it further turns out that any decision to specify MP with a particular theory of law depends on controversial conceptual or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clear away any " theoretical underbrush " 117 at all. We will still be knee deep in it. # II. Testing the Positive Turn # As it turns out, both things are true. It matters which theory of law underwrites the Core Argument, and defending any of them requires engaging in conceptual or normative argument. The burden of this Part is to show why that is. It meets that burden by analyzing how the Core Argument would run under four different approaches to giving meaning to the phrase " right kind of social facts " in MP.118 The first three each derive different specifications of MP from well-known theories of law : those of H.L.A. Hart, Joseph Raz, and Scott Shapiro. The final approach takes the " internal " perspective of a legal participant who denies the need to ground MP in a larger theory of law at all. # Although each of these approaches fits certain aspects of Baude and Sachs 's arguments quite well, not one of them enables the positive turn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false as applied to some of Baude and Sachs 's core substantive claims, 119 or it fails to generate its purported benefits-because it can not reduce the number of( let alone settle) disagreements over interpretive methodology, 120 because it leads to the kind of normative and conceptual debates it was meant to supplant, 121 or because it simply replicates the kind of arguments lawyers already make.122 In either case, we are back to where we started. # The lesson, though, is not simply that Baude and Sachs must find some other theory of law to ground the Core Argument. It is rather that any such effort would be self-defeating. The reason is that the positive turn manages to convey a sense of both originality and profundity only because it elides deep and hard questions about the nature of law and legal argument. Tracing out the implications of each of these different theories of law illustrates why such moments of ambiguity and evasion preclude the positive turn from delivering on its promise. # A. Hart 's Rule of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hart 's theory of law.123 Their embrace of Hart is understandable given how influential and widely accepted his theory has become.124 It turns out, though, that Hart 's model of law is poorly suited to the authors ' purposes. Hart 's theory is well known, so this Subpart gives only a brief outline of his view, glossing over complexities in his theory and exegetical disputes about his meaning. It then considers how the positive turn would look under Hart 's view. # 1. Summary # The problem Hart set out to solve in The Concept of Law was how to reconcile two features of legal systems that seemed potentially in tension with one another. On the one hand, the existence and content of law seemed to be mainly questions of fact ; on the other hand, those who live within a legal system tend to treat its rules of law as normative, or as guides to action.125 Although previous positivists( for example, Austin126 and Holmes127) had offered theories that explained the former quality of law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to solve this problem by introducing two key distinctions, both about the nature of rules( or, more specifically, what he called " social rules " or rules of conduct129). First, he distinguished between two points of view or perspectives with respect to any given rule or pattern of conduct.130 The " internal " perspective was that of someone who took such a rule as a guide for his or her own conduct.131 Such a person would describe the rule using normative language, with words like " should " and " must, " in sentences like " there is a rule that a man must bare his head in church. " 132 But one could also view the exact same behavior from an " external " perspective.133 Taking this perspective did not require the use of such normative language ; instead, one could simply describe the rule as a pattern of conduct in purely descriptive and predictive terms134-for example, " as a rule, men tend to take off their hats when entering church. " Crucially, a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiently large number of people take the internal point of view with respect to it.135 # Hart 's second distinction was between two types of social rules. " Primary " rules are rules of conduct that tell people how they should act.136 They could be legal rules, but they could also be rules of etiquette or baseball or whatever. " Secondary " rules, however, are rules that govern how one makes primary rules.137 So for instance, an organization 's bylaws providing that any change to the bylaws requires a two-thirds vote of the membership is a secondary rule. # In the union of these two ideas, Hart thought he had found " the key to the science of jurisprudence. " 138 The reason is that together they explained how law could exist as a matter of fact and yet also be the source of normative obligations for those who live under it.139 A primitive society with only " primary rules of obligation " can not be said to have a legal system because there is no " identifying or common mark " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morality or etiquette.140 Furthermore, such rules are difficult to define, hard to enforce, and hard to change.141 To overcome these " defects, " societies develop secondary rules, the satisfaction of which indicates that a given primary rule " is a rule of the group to be supported by the social pressure it exerts. " 142 Once a group of people-in particular, a group whom Hart calls " officials " -develops a practice of " accepting as a common public standard "( in other words, taking the internal point of view toward) such a secondary rule, one of two necessary and sufficient conditions of a legal system is satisfied.143 Such a rule, or set of rules, is what Hart famously called the " rule of recognition. " 144 The rule of recognition is shorthand for the set of rules that provide the criteria for making valid law.145 And because the rule of recognition is constituted by the practice of officials taking the internal point of view with respect to it, the key social facts for Hart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The Core Argument and the rule of recognition # What would the Core Argument look like under this understanding of the nature of law? It is tempting to fill out the major premise with something like, " The law is whatever the practice of current officials makes law. " This formulation nicely captures Hart 's core idea that law depends on a current social practice-a view Baude and Sachs repeatedly endorse.147 # So stated, however, this Major Premise contains two ambiguities, one of which can be put aside but the other of which is critical to clarify. The first ambiguity is about who counts as an " official. " Every government employee? Only high-ranking employees? Only judges? Lawyers, as well? Hart was not always entirely consistent on this matter, and other theorists have suggested other answers while remaining faithful to the spirit of Hart 's model.148 To their credit, Baude and Sachs both recognize the difficulty of this question and are upfront about their own provisional answers to it.149 So although making choices about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same problems raised below, this Subpart will not pursue that possibility here. Instead, it will follow Baude and Sachs in assuming that the relevant officials, at least for the purposes of determining the legal validity of interpretive rules, are judges.150 # The second ambiguity, however, must be addressed head on. According to Hart, there are two ways a rule can achieve the status of law : either it satisfies the criteria of the rule of recognition( for example, " it was passed by a majority of both houses of Congress and signed by the President ") or it is simply " accepted " by current officials as law( like the rule of recognition itself).151 In other words, the officials take the internal point of view with respect to it, viewing it as a source of legal obligation. Thus, a fleshed-out version of the Major Premise would state something like the following : # MP(H) : The law is either( a) whatever satisfies the criteria that officials treat as providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operand A) or( b) whatever officials simply accept as law( operand B). # The difference between the two operands of the disjunction, A and B, matters because it determines which kinds of facts are relevant to determining whether a rule qualifies as " law. " Both ultimately depend on the current practice of judges. But whereas B begins and ends with current practice( to determine if judges " accept " a given rule), A asks whether the rule has satisfied certain criteria of validity that current practice requires in order for something to qualify as law. In other words, it asks judges to examine a rule 's pedigree.152 # It is not always easy to discern which kinds of facts Baude and Sachs think matter for determining an interpretive rule 's legal status. Are they facts about whether the rule meets particular criteria of validity, which requires inquiry into the rule 's historical pedigree? Or are they simply facts about the interpretive rule 's current acceptance by judges, which does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separately. # a. Validated by the rule of recognition? # Sometimes Baude and Sachs seem to argue that whether an interpretive rule( or method or theory) is part of " our law " depends on whether it satisfies our legal system 's criteria of legal validity( or Hart 's rule of recognition).153 And they suggest that the relevant procedure is the ratification of the Constitution itself, so that the question of any given interpretive rule, whether constitutional or statutory, is whether it was part of our law at the Founding( or has been added through a valid rule of change).154 The problem with this view is that judicial practice does not require interpretive rules to be validated in this way. # Let us start in the constitutional context. Baude and Sachs provide a total of three examples in support of the claim that judges today require constitutional interpretive rules to have been ratified at the Founding, but two of them actually count as evidence against the authors ' thesis. Their best example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why both authors discuss it.155 In that case, Justice Breyer-in holding that subsequent governmental practice is relevant to the interpretation of the Recess Appointments Clause-quoted James Madison 's suggestion that such governmental practice may " liquidate &amp; settle " ambiguous provisions of the Constitution.156 Justice Breyer thus implied that using practice to interpret the Constitution is an interpretive method that must itself be authorized by Founding-era sources in just the way Baude and Sachs claim. # It is not obvious that Justice Breyer meant to assert that the turn to practice required validation from the Founding, but let us grant Baude and Sachs that one.157 One case is hardly sufficient to constitute a " practice, " and the fact that the other two cases Baude briefly mentions actually contradict his claim rather than support it suggests that establishing the existence of such a practice will be difficult. Baude explains that in the Pocket Veto Case the Court stated that subsequent practice " is a consideration of great weight, " 158 and he observes that in Mistretta v. United States the Court looked to subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provision and its original history.159 But neither of these facts supports Baude 's claim that the Court requires validation of an interpretive rule by its presence at the Founding. The Court in the Pocket Veto Case cited three cases in support of its use of subsequent practice as an interpretive aid, but in none of those cases did the various courts trace the method 's lineage back to the Founding.160 In fact, one of them cited provisions of Justice Story 's treatise on the Constitution in which he explicitly invokes subsequent practice as an alternative to original meaning.161 Nor is it sufficient that the Court in Mistretta looked to text or original meaning before looking to practice as a source of additional guidance. What inclusive originalism supposedly requires is that a court may only look to subsequent practice because of its inclusion in the original Constitution.162 And yet nothing in the Court 's opinion indicates that it saw itself as so constrained. # Baude acknowledges that the Court has not made its " methodological hierarchy explicit " in these cases, but he seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is an obvious alternative explanation for how courts treat interpretive rules. What the Court requires is some historical support for its interpretive approach in order to prove that it is not making the approach up out of whole cloth. The fact that a rule has been around for a long time suggests that it may be considered custom. And customary law is authoritative not because its pedigree is traceable to a particular validating event but rather because its age and endurance over time suggest that it works well or has been broadly accepted.164 Under this quite conventional common law understanding, the Court 's " methodological hierarchy " is not just not " explicit. " It is nonexistent. # The same point responds to Sachs 's suggestion that courts have a deep concern for pedigree when it comes to interpretive rules. Lacking much case law support beyond Noel Canning for this view, Sachs looks to " higher-order principles " and lawyerly intuitions about how we typically think about law.165 " If we found out tomorrow that stare decisis did n't exist at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whole cloth by Chief Justice Burger, " he asserts, " that 'd surely be concerning to many American lawyers and academics. " 166 # Maybe so, but this is surely a false dichotomy. If we found out that our practice of stare decisis in its current form was neither an " invention " of the last half-century nor a feature of the Founders ' law but was instead the result of gradual changes in legal practice throughout the nineteenth century, would that be " concerning to many American lawyers and academics "? I doubt it, which may be why it is easy to find examples of the Court employing methods for interpreting sources of constitutional law without bothering to trace the methods ' pedigrees back to the Founding.167 # Thus, even if Baude and Sachs are right that courts today in some sense " start " with original meaning, " inclusive originalem " and " original-law originalism, " as they describe those theories, require more than that. They require that interpretive rules and methods become part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Founders ' law( or by virtue of having been subsequently authorized by a valid rule of change).168 And yet Baude and Sachs provide scant evidence that courts today are( or ever were) in the slightest bit concerned about tracing the pedigree of second-order interpretive rules to the Founding. # The case for judicial concern with pedigree is even weaker in the context of statutory interpretation. Some interpretive rules( such as the Dictionary Act169) do have a clear legal pedigree, and Baude and Sachs mention some of these.170 But the hottest and hoariest debates among courts and scholars are not about the Dictionary Act. They instead revolve around unwritten interpretive rules and methods-things like canons of construction.171 # When it comes to such rules, Baude and Sachs again say that an interpretive rule 's legal status hangs on whether it was either ratified at the Founding or became part of our law through a valid rule of legal change subsequent to the Founding.172 The most likely candidate for such a rule of change in the context of unwritten law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the term " unwritten law " typically refers to case law). Such a rule might provide, for instance, that an interpretive rule qualifies as law if and only if its use is compelled by a controlling decision.173 So the Chevron rule requiring court deference to an agency 's reasonable interpretation of a statute it administers may be such an interpretive rule.174 It is an interpretive rule that qualifies as law, and it does so because the Supreme Court decided a case in which it articulated and applied that rule. But Chevron is the exception that proves the rule, as even Baude and Sachs recognize. They concede that courts generally do not treat interpretive rules as binding as a matter of stare decisis.175 # Baude and Sachs may object that I have only challenged their minor premise-that the sort of methods originalism they advance is in fact the law. I have done nothing to show that the positive turn as such, which requires looking to " our law, " is not a useful methodological development. So, for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an interpretive rule 's pedigree be traceable back to the Founding as their own personal view, while recognizing that " other people might propose other tests instead. " 176 # But that misses the point of the discussion above. The problem is not just that courts do not adopt original-law( or original-methods) originalism. The problem is that courts today rarely trace the pedigrees of the unwritten interpretive rules they standardly employ to any ultimate criterion of legality.177 Thus, when it comes to interpreting the Constitution or statutes, the first operand of the disjunction in MP(H), A, can not help us distinguish between lawful and unlawful interpretive rules. # b. Accepted by current practice? # Even if interpretive rules are not made part of the law by virtue of having satisfied some accepted set of criteria determining legal validity, those rules may nevertheless attain the status of law on Hart 's view so long as they are " accepted " by judges as part of what performing their official duty requires them to do. Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the rule of recognition itself. This, of course, is the second operand, B, in the disjunction contained in MP(H).178 # Baude and Sachs at various points suggest that this is how they imagine interpretive rules-both constitutional and statutory-becoming law. Sachs, for instance, devotes considerable attention to what he calls " domesticating doctrines " -like stare decisis-which validate ex post changes that did not come about through valid rules of change.179 And Baude and Sachs suggest that we ought to understand canons of construction as part of what they call " general "( unwritten) law.180 Under this view, when judges invoke canons of construction, " they are n't necessarily ' inventing rules of decision out of whole cloth. ' " 181 Rather, " they might be recognizing elements of an existing generallaw tradition-a tradition that makes its appearance in judicial decisions, but is n't merely their creature. " 182 In other words, they encourage us to think of canons of construction and other unwritten interpretive rules as incorporated into our legal corpus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first point to observe about this suggestion is just how starkly it contrasts with Baude and Sachs 's concern with pedigree discussed above.183 Recall Sachs 's insistence that " if we ca n't say when things have changed, that makes it harder to explain how they changed, which makes us less confident that they 've changed. " 184 Now we learn that " a new rule might be slowly absorbed or rejected as general law, rather than imposed through the fiat of a single majority. " 185 Really? But if the new rule is " slowly absorbed " by the general law, then we can not say precisely when the law changed. And if we can not say when the law changed...? # The more important point, though, goes to what is required for a rule to become part of the law if it does not do so by virtue of having satisfied the criteria of validity provided by the rule of recognition. Hart is quite clear on this score : a " social rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the rule is met with criticism among the relevant community, 186 which in this case( we are still assuming) consists of other judges. So, for instance, a judge who failed to treat as binding law a congressional statute passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the President would be criticized by other judges for violating our legal system 's rule of recognition. # Is the same true of judges who fail to apply a canon of construction in a given case? Is there a " general demand for conformity " 187 with respect to the use of any particular canon of construction? Is it the case that the " social pressure brought to bear upon those " who fail to use the rule of lenity or the rule of constitutional avoidance is " great, " as Hart would require? 188 To be sure, one can find criticisms in any given case of a court 's failure to apply a particular canon, but the key terms here are " general demand " and " social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a social rule like the rule of recognition to exist there must be consensus or near-consensus as to its obligatory status.189 Because the rule of recognition derives its legal status from its existence as official practice( rather than from having passed through the rule of recognition), under Hart 's view, there can only be a " law of interpretation " insofar as such consensus or near-consensus exists.190 # No doubt consensus is achieved around some interpretive approaches. A Supreme Court that completely fails to cite relevant precedent( even if only to then overrule it) might be said to violate such an accepted practice.191 Similarly, Lawrence Solum points out that pretty much everyone agrees that the Constitution 's text contributes in some way to its legal content.192 More subtly, Baude and Sachs suggest that reading accessory liability into a criminal statute is a practice largely taken for granted.193 # But recall that the promise of the positive turn was to show how " our law "( of interpretation) could offer us a way out of the scholarly impasse over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely those interpretive methods about which there is not consensus( for instance, whether and how to use canons of construction and how to " construct " constitutional provisions when the text is vague), it is hard to see how the positive turn to " our law " could possibly be of value to either judges or scholars.194 This is why Richard Fallon, whom Baude and Sachs take to task for resorting immediately to normative assessment of interpretive rules, 195 did not linger long on the possibility that the " law of interpretation " could provide answers to such interpretive debates. Fallon recognizes that under Hart 's view, where there is no consensus, there is no law.196 # c. The problem of disagreement # Given these difficulties, it may be tempting to simply deny the requirement Hart imposes. Baude and Sachs might argue, for instance, that such judicial consensus about interpretive rules is too demanding a requirement. They sometimes say exactly that.197 When judges rely on such methods, after all, they offer legal arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to determine what the law requires. In that sense, such interpretive methods properly qualify as " law, " and if that is inconsistent with Hart 's framework, then so much the worse for his framework. # In fact, that is just what Ronald Dworkin argued thirty years ago.198 Pointing to exactly the kinds of interpretive rules and methods that interest Baude and Sachs, he argued that Hart 's theory of law could not account for the pervasive disagreement one sees in judicial practice over the proper methods to employ when interpreting cases, statutes, and the Constitution.199 Dworkin thought that was a problem for Hart because Dworkin, like Baude and Sachs, observed that judges treat these interpretive rules as law-determining ones even though they disagree with each other about whether and when to use them.200 Thus, these rules seem to serve a function analogous to the rule of recognition, yet they do not enjoy the judicial consensus that Hart 's theory requires. Dworkin called this the problem of " ' theoretical ' disagreement, " 201 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critiques of Hart. # There have been various responses to the problem of theoretical disagreement-and we will consider two, including Dworkin 's, below202-but the point now is just to see why Hart 's own response to it is not available to the authors.203 Hart accused Dworkin of taking judicial rhetoric too seriously.204 Although it is true that judges say they use these interpretive principles and methods to determine " the law, " in reality they are implementing a kind of discretion that exists when there is ambiguity as to how to read some statute, case, or the Constitution.205 In other words, they are making law, not finding law.206 # Baude and Sachs can not endorse Hart 's response for two main reasons. First, they repeatedly defend the value of taking judicial rhetoric seriously.207 Their whole point in suggesting that we look to our " general "( unwritten) law or our " legal tradition " to resolve our interpretive disputes depends on the idea that " the law " offers some determinate answers to the questions they raise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is precisely what Hart denied.209 The second and more important reason is the one already stated above : if there is no " law " on these questions, then the second syllogism in the Core Argument fails to go through.210 Because interpretive rules that do not enjoy widespread consensus do not qualify as law( in Hart 's sense), there is no obligation on the part of judges to apply them. And that was supposed to be one of the chief payoffs of the positive turn. # At times, Baude and Sachs seem to recognize the problem of disagreement, 211 but their responses indicate that they fail to grasp its significance. For instance, at one point, they frame the problem of disagreement as a " practical " problem because such disagreement " makes it harder to see what the law is. " 212 But the problem is theoretical, not practical, and it is not that the disagreement makes it harder to " see " the law. At least under Hart 's view, if there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule of recognition, then it can not be part of the rule of recognition, which means that there is no law to see.213 That is why, as Mark Greenberg explains, no defender of any controversial theory of legal interpretation can appeal to Hartian positivism for support.214 It follows that the same is true of Baude and Sachs 's originalmethods sort of originalism. # Elsewhere, Baude and Sachs suggest that in order for there to be " no law " on a topic, a legal system would have to utterly break down, which they quite rightly deny has happened.215 But such deep and pervasive disagreement is not necessary to cause a problem for their approach. All that is needed is for there to be insufficient judicial consensus about whether a particular interpretive rule is a criterion of validity for establishing the legality of other rules. Without such consensus, a rule can not be part of the rule of recognition and( therefore) fails to qualify as law at all.216 # For this reason, it may be tempting for Baude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consensus if the issue is framed at a sufficiently high level of generality. All or nearly all courts agree, for instance, that there has been constitutional " continuity " since the Founding.217 They all recognize, in other words, that there have been " no revolutions " between 1789( or at least 1866) and today.218 Disagreement among courts, on this view, only arises when it comes to applying our shared commitment to the " original law. " As Baude and Sachs put it in a subsequent essay, it is a view that is " catholic in theory but exacting in application. " 219 # But this response is either false or vacuous, depending on what Baude and Sachs mean by " continuity. " If they mean that courts treat the original meaning of the Constitution as the " ultimate criterion for constitutional law, including of the validity of other methods of interpretation, " 220 then it is descriptively false for the reason already given, namely that there is little evidence that courts scrutinize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all, let alone trace them back to the Founding.221 Alternatively, if Baude and Sachs mean that courts see themselves as operating as part of the same constitutional tradition as the Founders, then that seems true but too weak a claim to be of any use in rechanneling debates over interpretation in more productive ways. The reason is that so framed, there is still a lot of room for the sort of theoretical( rather than empirical) disagreement Dworkin observed. Does being part of the same continuous legal tradition as the Founders, for instance, entail that methods of interpretation may be absorbed through an evolutionary, common law process, or does it require a more formal " rule of change " to validly include such methods? Historical facts can not answer that question because whether the Framers ' view on this issue matters is precisely the question at issue. Yet one can imagine reasonable judges disagreeing about it. Indeed, as suggested in their articles, the authors themselves seem to be of two minds about it.222 # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is less " indeterminacy " than one might think because there are interpretive rules whose function is to resolve close cases. First, " closure rules " tell courts what to do in zones of doubt, much as a burden of proof does in the factfinding context.223 The rule of lenity, by which courts interpret ambiguous criminal statutes in favor of defendants, is one example of such a closure rule.224 Second, " when even the closure rules run out, we have authority rules to tell us how to resolve individual disputes- such as a rule that five Justices beat four. " 225 # This response is so bizarre that it practically amounts to a reductio ad absurdum of their whole argument. True, there is widespread consensus supporting rules of court procedure like voting rules, so such rules would indeed qualify as " law " under Hart 's model. And no one can stop Baude and Sachs from including within the scope of the " law of interpretation " such procedural rules for settling intracourt disagreement. But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " reorient " 227 scholarly debates over the proper roles of, among other things, canons of construction, legislative history, stare decisis, executive practice, original meaning, linguistic analysis, purposive interpretation, and political theory in statutory and constitutional interpretation by looking to a rule that says five Justices beat four, then the positive turn is not a U-turn. It is a lobotomy. # In short, contrary to Baude and Sachs 's suggestions, if we fill out the major premise along the lines of MP(H), the Core Argument is not up to the task they demand of it. Hart requires that we look to current judicial practice to determine what counts as law, and yet courts today generally do not trace the pedigree of interpretive rules( in either constitutional or statutory interpretation) back to the Founding or even to any valid rule of change. Nor do the interpretive rules Baude and Sachs discuss qualify as " law " by virtue of judicial consensus in the way that the rule of recognition does. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little " law of interpretation, " which means that the interpretive rules Baude and Sachs discuss impose upon judges no legal obligation. # None of this means that the positive turn is necessarily a failure. What we have been testing here is its consistency with one particular way of conceptualizing law. True, it is the most widely accepted theory of law and the one Baude and Sachs themselves purport to endorse. But the implication of the analysis above may be that we must abandon Hart 's theory of law, not the positive turn.228 So let us see how MP might be filled out with two alternatives to Hart 's approach. # B. Raz 's Sources Thesis # Joseph Raz has developed one of the main rivals to Hart 's version of legal positivism. Like Hart, Raz holds that the existence of a legal system 's criterion of legal validity( and, therefore, the existence of its law) is entirely a question of social fact.229 But unlike Hart, Raz further insists that it is impossible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis for determining what counts as law.230 That is why legal philosophers dub his view " hard " or " exclusive " legal positivism, thereby distinguishing it from Hart 's " soft " or " inclusive " legal positivism.231 To see why Raz imposes this further restriction on which kinds of facts can determine law, this Subpart examines how he develops his theory of law from his understanding of the nature of authority. Doing so demonstrates why Baude and Sachs can not rely on Raz as jurisprudential support for MP without invoking just the kinds of arguments they insist the positive turn avoids. # 1. Summary # Raz 's account is based on the authoritative nature of law.232 According to Raz, every legal system either has legitimate authority or claims to have such authority.233 Authorities in general should base their directives on reasons that already apply to those subject to their authority.234 Someone 's authority over a subject is legitimate if the subject will " better comply with reasons which apply to him " if he follows the directives of the authority " than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him directly. " 235 In this way, an authority 's directives depend on( and preempt) the reasons that apply to a subject, and when the authority is legitimate, they do so to the benefit of the subject. # Not all( or even any) legal systems possess legitimate authority, but according to Raz, they all claim to possess it( which is why we call legal sources " authorities ").236 And if law claims to have legitimate authority, then it must at least be the kind of thing that is capable of having it.237 Any person or persons claiming authority must be capable of issuing a binding directive that possesses at least two features :( 1) it must be " presented as someone 's view of how its subjects ought to behave " and( 2) " it must be possible to identify the directive as being issued by the alleged authority without relying on reasons or considerations on which the directive purports to adjudicate. " 238 Therefore, law-legal rules and directives-must possess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of Raz 's criticism of Hart. Hart allowed for the possibility that a rule of recognition might incorporate moral criteria.239 So, for instance, if the practice of officials is such that they all agree that for a rule to be legally valid it must satisfy the requirements of " due process " or be " reasonable, " and if application of those concepts itself requires moral judgments, then the law incorporates moral rules or principles.240 But Raz argues that this possibility is inconsistent with the second requirement of binding directives mentioned above because it would mean that determining the law requires making reference to precisely the reasons the law was meant to replace.241 # According to Raz, only the Sources Thesis satisfies both of the requirements above.242 The Sources Thesis holds that the existence and content of law " can be identified by reference to social facts alone, without any resort to any evaluative argument. " 243 This is true of each of the typical sources of law in most legal systems : statutes, cases, and custom.244 But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily and exclusively determined by social facts. # 2. The Core Argument and the Sources Thesis # Perhaps, then, the Sources Thesis offers Baude and Sachs a jurisprudential basis for the positive turn. Consistent with their views, it emphasizes that social facts primarily-indeed, exclusively-determine the existence and content of law. Moreover, the emphasis on authority seems to fit well with Baude and Sachs 's suggestion that our practices take seriously the Founders ' authority.246 Because we treat the Founders as authorities on matters of substantive constitutional law, we should also treat them as issuers of binding directives with respect to our rules and methods of constitutional and statutory interpretation. So maybe MP could be filled out along the lines of : # MP(R) : The law is whatever can be found in the relevant social sources, so long as they can be " identified by reference to social facts alone, without any resort to any evaluative argument. " # The first thing to observe about MP(R) is that it may not help resolve the problem of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " relevant " social sources are, and it seems that Raz probably has something like a rule of recognition in mind as the means by which judges are able to identify the law.248 If that is the case, then the problem raised by judicial disagreement, discussed above in reference to MP(H), 249 would beset MP(R) as well. # But even putting that issue aside, there are two related, and deeper, problems. The first is that Raz 's exclusive legal positivism cuts against the whole thrust of Baude and Sachs 's defense of originalism. In their view, quite expansive methods of constitutional interpretation are permissible if( but only if) they were part of our " original law. " 250 Thus, if it turned out that as a historical matter, the Founders intended future judges to determine the law by reference to moral principles, it would seem that Baude and Sachs are committed to allowing for that scenario. After all, the possibility that the Founders may have envisioned more flexible forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticize more traditional, restrictive forms of originalism. " Why be more ' originalist ' than the Founders, or more Catholic than the Pope?, " they each ask.251 Baude even dubs his brand of originalism " inclusive originalism, " explicitly drawing an analogy to the exclusive/inclusive positivism distinction that divides Raz and Hart.252 # Baude and Sachs might object that I have conflated two distinct issues. There is a difference between the Founders ' authorizing( a) forms of constitutional interpretation that allow judges considerable discretion to change the meaning of terms as society evolves( operand A) and( b) forms of constitutional interpretation that involve judges determining what the law is by reference to moral principles( operand B). Baude and Sachs might well concede that their theories of originalism allow for A but insist that, along with Raz, they deny that B is true. In other words, when judges interpret the Constitution 's broad language, they make law rather than find it.253 # But this response leads to the second problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sachs 's resistance to B? Raz has an answer to this question. For Raz, B is conceptually impossible because it is inconsistent with the nature of law, and it is inconsistent with the nature of law because it is inconsistent with the nature of authority. In particular, as we have just seen, it would mean that identifying the law requires referring to precisely those considerations( specifically, moral ones) that an authority 's binding directive purports to settle.254 But because law claims authority, its directives must at least be identifiable without referring to such underlying considerations. Thus, law can not incorporate moral principles in this way. # Whether Raz 's argument is convincing is not this Article 's concern. Rather, the point is that Baude and Sachs can not avail themselves of the argument without undermining the whole rationale for the positive turn. Recall that they offer a turn to " positive " defenses of originalism and other forms of constitutional and statutory interpretation on the ground that " conceptual " arguments are irrelevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophers insist that the nature of " interpretation " requires looking to the original intentions of a document 's drafters, if that is not how lawyers in, say, France read their legal documents, then so much the worse for the philosopher 's theory. French legal practice trumps philosophical theory( in France, at least).256 Presumably, then, the same would be true of the concept of authority. If it appears that judges invoke moral principles in determining what the law is, then it is not at all obvious why, under Baude and Sachs 's view, we should allow such a " conceptual " argument like Raz 's to refute an observed practice.257 # The same point responds to a different objection. Baude and Sachs might( again) insist that I have conflated the methodological with the substantive claim. Perhaps the turn to our( now Razian) understanding of law does not vindicate their version of originalism, but that would just mean that their substantive argument fails, not that the positive turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantive claim about what the law requires based on the Sources Thesis will have to defend that thesis, which is itself the conclusion of a conceptual argument about the nature of authority. # In short, although it is conceivable that one could develop an originalist account based on Raz 's theory of law, the spirit of Baude and Sachs 's " inclusive " versions of originalism seems deeply inconsistent with Raz 's hard positivism. And although it is possible to offer an interpretation of legal practice( originalist or otherwise) that is consistent with the Sources Thesis, any substantive legal claims derived from such an interpretation would depend on the kind of conceptual arguments that the positive turn promised to enable us to avoid. # C. Shapiro 's Planning Theory of Law # Scott Shapiro has recently advanced a theory of law that he calls the " Planning Theory " of law because it conceptualizes law as a type of plan formed by a group of individuals.258 The Planning Theory fits Baude and Sachs 's ambitions better than does either Hart 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive turn on Shapiro 's account would lead to the same sorts of difficulties that plagued our earlier efforts. # 1. Summary # To understand why Shapiro 's account may prove attractive to Baude and Sachs, it is useful to first show how Shapiro builds on Dworkin 's criticism of Hart.259 Dworkin argues that Hart can not explain the way judges disagree with one another about what he calls the " grounds of law, " which are propositions that make legal propositions true or false.260 These include exactly the kind of interpretive rules and methods under discussion.261 A better way to explain this " theoretical disagreement, " according to Dworkin, is to recognize that law is a social practice and that judges are participants in that practice.262 Because they participate in the practice of law, judges must adopt an " interpretive attitude " 263( or what Dworkin elsewhere called an " internal point of view " 264) toward the legal materials they face. Adopting this attitude requires judges to impose meaning on those materials by putting them in their " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretation " constructive interpretation. " 266 Such interpretations must both " fit " the practice( plausibly describe its central features) and justify it as a normative matter.267 So, for instance, even a judge who interprets a statute by reference to its " plain meaning " does so on the ground that it makes best sense of the practice and serves important political values( for example, preserving democracy and rule-of-law values).268 Thus, legal interpretation- all legal interpretation-depends on political and moral values.269 # Shapiro agrees with much of this analysis. He agrees with Dworkin that the interpretive disagreement Dworkin describes is a real and pervasive feature of our legal system and that such disagreement can not be explained by Hart 's rule of recognition, which requires consensus among officials.270 He also agrees with Dworkin that part of that disagreement is disagreement about the point or purpose of legal practice overall.271 He even joins Dworkin in concluding that the proper theory of statutory or constitutional interpretation is largely determined by how well it achieves that purpose.272 But whereas Dworkin argues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political principles, Shapiro insists it is a question of social fact alone.273 To see why that is, one must know a bit more about Shapiro 's Planning Theory of law. # Shapiro holds that laws are best understood as plans and, specifically, plans of a particular sort-they are " shared " plans among groups of people whose purpose is to " guide, organize, and monitor the shared activity of legal officials. " 274 More importantly, they are plans whose existence and content are determined exclusively by publicly ascertainable social facts rather than by moral theory.275 This requirement follows from the fact that the fundamental aim of law, according to Shapiro, is to solve social problems that involve controversial moral and practical questions and require solutions that are often complex.276 Therefore, if determining the content of law required making moral judgments, which are invariably contested and contentious, it would undermine the whole point of having law in the first place.277 # Shapiro then develops a " Planning Theory of meta-interpretation. " 278 A meta-interpretive theory is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans( statutes) or the master plan( a constitution).279 According to Shapiro, one of the central considerations for any such meta270. interpretive theory is the degree of trust it places in different officials.280 " Purposivists " in the context of statutory interpretation, for instance, generally have confidence in the competence and good character of judges to understand the purposes of legislation, whereas those who are " textualists " tend to be more skeptical that judges possess either virtue.281 The crucial point is that under the Planning Theory 's approach, picking interpretive methodologies requires discerning the planners ' judgments about judicial character and competence and then asking whether a particular interpretive approach is consistent with those judgments.282 Under this view, we should resolve our debates about constitutional interpretation by looking to whether-and if so, to what degree-the Framers of and signatories to the Constitution trusted future judges to implement the " master plan. " 283 # Thus, Shapiro argues for a different procedure for settling metainterpretive disputes than does Dworkin. Because Dworkin thinks that the proper interpretive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those methods fit and justify legal practice, choosing from among them requires the interpreter to engage in moral theorizing.284 But for Shapiro, the proper interpretive methods( like all law) are determined by the plan that the planners created-in particular, by the plan 's economy of trust.285 Therefore, choosing such an interpretive theory requires the interpreter to defer to the planners ' judgments about interpretive methodology. # 2. The Core Argument and the Planning Theory # Baude and Sachs hardly mention Shapiro 's account, but in many ways, it seems to be a perfect fit for the Core Argument. We might formulate its major premise as the following : # MP(S) : The law is whatever plans were made pursuant to the master plan, including its " economy of trust, " where the " economy of trust " describes the planners ' plan for how future officials( particularly judges) would go about interpreting the master plan and its subsidiary plans. # MP(S) has a lot going for it. Unlike MP(H) or MP(R), it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, let alone judicial consensus, to determine the criteria of legal validity.286 Instead, it looks to the content of the master plan and, in particular, to the " economy of trust " embodied in it. And yet it remains positivist in orientation because the disagreement over the grounds of law that Dworkin points to is interpreted as empirical, not moral, disagreement.287 MP(S) thus seems capable of fulfilling the promise of the positive turn. It shows how turning to " our law " could offer a genuine methodological advance insofar as it both demands an essentially factual inquiry and applies to methodological issues about which courts and scholars disagree. # It is true that under Shapiro 's account, as under Raz 's, moral principles can not be incorporated into the criteria of legality. So, as with Raz, Baude and Sachs would need to explain why judges who seem to be applying moral principles in determining the law are better viewed as employing judicial discretion to make or develop the law. And, as we will see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty they did in relying on Raz, namely having to defend their choice of legal theory on " conceptual " grounds.288 But for now it is sufficient to observe that Shapiro gives Baude and Sachs more resources than does Raz for interpreting judicial conduct in the way their theory requires. In particular, Shapiro defends his emphasis on the " economy of trust " by showing the extent to which concerns with trust do, as a matter of fact, pervade American legal thought and practice.289 # For these reasons, the fit between Baude and Sachs 's methodological agenda and Shapiro 's account is sufficiently strong that they may want to explore the possibility of committing themselves to something like his view. Nevertheless, the remainder of this Subpart will flag two concerns about whether Shapiro 's account really can save the positive turn in the way I have just suggested. Each questions whether the two advantages just identified hold up under scrutiny : First, does Shapiro 's theory really allow that law can exist without consensus among some relevant group? Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without recourse to normative arguments? I then explain why, even if these worries can be overcome, the positive turn still is incapable of achieving its purported aims. # a.Consensus at the Founding? # Both Shapiro and Baude and Sachs( at times) argue that we should look to facts about the Founding to determine which interpretive methods we should use today. True, they are not precisely the same historical facts. Shapiro 's Planning Theory of meta-interpretation looks to the planners ' attitudes about future judges and legislators( how much the planners trusted them to get the plans right), whereas Baude and Sachs ask us to look at specific interpretive rules embodied in the law at the time. But let us put that wrinkle aside and assume that Shapiro offers support for the basic idea that we should look to the Founders ' law to settle our disputes over interpretive methodology. # The question then becomes : How do we tell which interpretive rules were part of the law at the time of the Founding? Baude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must rely on only those rules that had the status of law, not just custom, at the Founding.290 Once again, though, it is not at all obvious how that is to be done. Baude and Sachs acknowledge that " different theories of jurisprudence look to different facts to identify a society 's law, " but just as we saw above when discussing Hart, it is unclear what kind of facts such theories look to.291 Sometimes it is suggested that the theories pick out different criteria of validity( or " higher-order legal rules "), 292 but other times it seems that we must look to the practices of certain groups of people.293 The ambiguity stems in part from the fact that it is not always apparent whether Baude and Sachs mean that interpretive rules require validation by reference to other " higher- order legal rules " or whether those interpretive rules are the higher-order rules by reference to which substantive interpretive disputes were resolved. # The ambiguity does not much matter, however, because in the end, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about lawdetermining practices at some level. If the " legal " status of certain interpretive rules depends on their satisfaction of some criteria of validity, we must ask what makes those criteria the law-validating ones. We already know that under Hart 's theory, the existence of such rules( of recognition) depends on there being a common practice of officials treating them as such.294 So this approach will mean that the existence of a " legal " answer to questions about interpretive methodology will depend on there being a consensus among judges. As it turns out, the same is true under Shapiro 's account. In his view, for there to be content to the master plan 's economy of trust, there must be consensus with respect to it among those who " created and adopted " it.295 # The worry, of course, is that no such consensus existed. Baude and Sachs discuss the work of historians, for instance, who argue that there was considerable disagreement about the proper way to interpret the Constitution at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observe that those same historians characterize the meta-interpretive conflict as one between, on the one hand, elite lawyers( who adopted Blackstone 's interpretive methodology) and, on the other, popular critics like the Antifederalist Brutus( who challenged the Blackstonian view " on policy grounds ").297 If that is right, and if it is " elite practice that matters, " then what the historians have shown according to Baude and Sachs is, ironically, that the elites actually had a " jurisprudential obligation " to ignore such popular criticisms.298 # But that characterization of the Founding-era debate is more than a little misleading. Cornell, for instance, argues that Brutus, and critics like him, represented a constitutional " middle ground " that embraced neither the elites ' view of law nor the " popular champions of the people 's constitution. " 299 And although those critics challenged a particular, Blackstonian approach to statutory and constitutional interpretation, it is not obvious why their criticisms of the Blackstonian view would not have equal claim to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, although some of the state courts were dominated by elite opinion, the highest courts of some other important states, such as New York and Pennsylvania, were dominated by men " whose approach to law reflected the ideas of the constitutional middle ground. " 300 In other words, there seem to have been genuinely " legal " arguments on both sides of the methodological issue. # Of course, it is open to Baude and Sachs to say that their own " theory of jurisprudence " picks out the relevant social facts in such a way that it includes the views of the elites they mention and excludes those of Brutus. But the question would then be : On what basis do they make that choice of theory? How do we determine whose practice counts? 301 As shown below, this question points to a core difficulty at the heart of the positive turn. # b.Empirical disagreement? # Before taking up that question, however, let us look at the other advantage Shapiro 's account appears to offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence and content of shared plans. Thus, when people disagree about what those shared plans require-either substantively or as a matter of interpretive methodology-those disagreements are factual in nature, even if they are facts that are not always easy to prove. But we need to look more carefully at how MP(S)( and the meta-interpretive approach it requires) flows from Shapiro 's account of the nature of law. # Sometimes Shapiro seems to argue that such an approach to choosing an interpretive theory is entailed by the Planning Theory of law itself. If laws are plans whose purpose is to foreclose contentious disagreements, and if making judgments about the proper " economy of trust " leads to such disagreements, then the " logic of planning " would seem to require interpreters to defer to the planners ' understandings of such an economy of trust as well.302 The same logic by which law forecloses reopening the substantive underlying normative disputes also forecloses reopening second-order disputes about how to interpret the meaning of those settlements.303 # It turns out, though, that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proper meta-interpretive procedure is an empirical inquiry because it depends on facts about current legal practice.304 In particular, choosing the right method requires asking why the current participants of the legal system accept, or at least purport to accept, the system as designed by its planners.305 Different systems provide different answers to that question.306 In " authority systems, " current officials accept " the rules of the system " because " these rules were created by those having superior moral authority or judgment, " which makes the rules ' pedigrees particularly important.307 Under these kinds of systems, the Planning Theory of meta-interpretation that grounds MP(S) above is indeed the proper one. # But not all legal systems are authority systems. Shapiro explains that there are also " opportunistic " legal systems.308 In these systems, the officials accept the system 's rules not because of the moral authority of the planners but because " they judge those rules to be morally good. " 309 For that reason, it is perfectly appropriate in opportunistic systems for officials to make their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods based on what they think are the proper moral or political criteria rather than by deferring to the planners ' views on the economy of trust.310 In these systems, then, MP(S) would not hold. The law would not depend on the attitudes about the economy of trust held by the planners ; instead, it would depend on the attitudes of current officials. # How, then, do we know whether our own legal system is an authority system, which supports MP(S), or an opportunistic system, which does not? For his part, Shapiro asserts that the United States " strongly resembles an authority system. " 311 The reverence for our " Founding Fathers, " the " privileging of democracy to the exclusion of all other modes of political legitimization, " the " political impossibility of criticizing the Constitution, " and the significance assigned to the text of the Constitution all suggest that we live in a system in which the Constitution derives its authority from " its special provenance. " 312 No doubt Baude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, they make more or less the same kind of argument on behalf of their own versions of originalism.313 # But not everyone would agree. It is easy to think of arguments on behalf of an " opportunistic " interpretation of our legal system. One might consider the following facts : most people do not take the Framers as moral authorities on all matters, the relations among races and between the sexes being the two most obvious examples ; even Supreme Court decisions invalidating democratically enacted legislation are accepted when they are in line with general public opinion ; 314 and having a clear textual basis is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for a rule to qualify as a valid and enforceable rule of constitutional law.315 # Nor does Shapiro deny such reasonable disagreement. To the contrary, the pervasiveness of such disagreement is part of the phenomenon he seeks to explain. In fact, it turns out that disagreement about whether our legal system is an authority system or an opportunistic one is yet another example of the kind of " theoretical disagreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way than does Dworkin's.316 His explanation is more satisfactory, remember, because under his view such disagreement is empirical, not moral, in nature-it is about the beliefs and attitudes of current officials.317 It is thus consistent with the logic of planning.318 # Is this really empirical disagreement, though? Shapiro 's own description of how such disagreement plays out gives cause for doubt. The sole example he provides of such meta-interpretive debate is one about how to decide whether the Eighth Amendment 's ban on " cruel and unusual punishments " renders the death penalty unconstitutional.319 Shapiro first imagines an originalist who emphasizes the Founders ' distrust of judges in support of the view that the Founders wished to cabin judicial discretion.320 In response, an antioriginalist might suggest that the tenure and salary protection the Constitution affords judges reflects a greater confidence in their competence and character.321 Such an antioriginalist may even go on to challenge whether the United States is an authority system at all.322 What Shapiro says here is striking : # The text of the Constitution, antioriginalists might point out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Why would those who currently participate in the practice allow themselves to be governed by the " dead hand of the past "? It is more plausible, they might say, that current participants accept the constitutional system because they regard it as independently justifiable.323 # It is true that the proposition in dispute is a factual one insofar as its truth hangs on a question about the beliefs and attitudes of a group of people, namely the officials of our legal system. But moral principles seem to be playing an important role in the explanation of official behavior.324 In particular, the alleged democratic illegitimacy posed by the dead hand problem seems to count as a reason for believing that officials possess certain attitudes about our practices rather than other attitudes. And if that is the case, then the truth of moral propositions will be relevant to the debate. Shapiro would then be correct in concluding that there is " something for everyone " in his picture because it would include even Dworkinians who argue about what the law requires in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is wrong. Suppose Shapiro is right that theoretical disagreement is primarily empirical disagreement, that we do live in an authority system, and that the proper meta-interpretive theory is one that looks to the Founders ' economy of trust. Suppose, too, that it is wrong to suggest, as I did above, 326 that there was meta-interpretive disagreement at the time of the Founding. So imagine we could establish in some relatively uncontroversial way which interpretive rules really were included in the Founders ' law and that looking to such law to settle our meta-interpretive debates fits naturally with( even if it does not follow deductively from) Shapiro 's Planning Theory of law. In short, imagine that MP(S) does offer Baude and Sachs a way of making the Core Argument produce plausible and nonbanal conclusions, rendering its use a genuine methodological advance. # Let us grant all of that, and still we must ask : What if Shapiro 's Planning Theory is wrong? As we have now seen, the Core Argument does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either of two alternative accounts of law-those of Hart and Raz.327 So we have at least established that it matters which account of law one adopts. The next question is : How do we choose from among competing theories? Or put in more technical jargon, what are the criteria for theory choice when it comes to philosophical accounts of law? # As it happens, this question is one of the most fiercely debated in jurisprudential circles these days. The issue is whether jurisprudential accounts are more analogous to scientific theories, on the one hand, or moral or political philosophical theories, on the other. If they are analogous to theories in the natural and social sciences, then the thought is that they should respond exclusively to such epistemic criteria as empirical adequacy, consistency, simplicity, and explanatory power.328 But if they are like moral or political philosophical theories, then( not surprisingly) they must be judged by such moral criteria as, for example, whether they conform to our best understanding of how people should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words, the basic question is whether philosophical accounts of law are best understood as descriptive or normative theories.330 # We need not resolve this debate because under either view, the positive turn leads us right back into the kinds of debates from which it promised escape. If the descriptivists are right, then jurisprudential theories are accounts of the " nature " of law, the discovery of which requires what philosophers call " conceptual analysis. " 331 And we have already seen in the discussion of Raz why taking this approach would undermine the positive turn.332 The whole purpose of the positive turn was to allow scholars to avoid not just normative but also " conceptual " debates about whether, for instance, the " nature " of interpretation or meaning or authority entails an originalist interpretive approach.333 Choosing Shapiro 's theory would require a conceptual defense of the claim that laws are plans( or plan-like norms).334 # What about the other approach? The normativists argue that jurisprudence is and ought to be a fundamentally normative form of inquiry.335 Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premise. It would state something like : # MP(S&middot;) : The law ought to be understood as whatever plans are made pursuant to the master plan, including its " economy of trust, " where the " economy of trust " describes the master planners ' plan for how future officials( particularly judges) would go about interpreting the master plan and subsidiary plans. # The justification for MP(S&middot;) would look to the rule-of-law values and settlement function that sticking to shared plans helps societies achieve. Scott Hershovitz has shown why Shapiro 's Planning Theory may be better understood as a sophisticated elaboration of such a normative brand of legal positivism-one that privileges the political value known as " legality, " which serves as the title of Shapiro 's book.336 # One could easily imagine an argument of this sort supporting Baude and Sachs 's substantive claims.337 They might argue that their approach to resolving meta-interpretive disputes both privileges democratic decisionmaking and preserves important rule-of-law values. Even if many groups were excluded from the Constitution 's ratification process( for example, women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a virtually unprecedented act of popular sovereignty. Of course, the law must change over time to reflect the will of the people as the body politic changes, but because people disagree about the direction legal change should take, we need procedures for settling such disagreements and for enacting particular understandings into law.338 And because the meanings of the texts that form the primary material of our legal corpus are themselves a source of disagreement, we need second-order interpretive rules to settle those debates by determining the legal content of particular texts-whether constitutional, statutory, or case law. Thus, by demanding that we ask whether some particular second-order interpretive rule was part of the law at the Constitution 's ratification, we both vindicate the rule-of-law values that all rules provide( stability, predictability, et cetera) and do so in a way that preserves democratic legitimacy. # The problem with this approach is obvious. The positive turn would no longer be positivist in the methodological sense. Under this view, because " law " is an inherently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core positivist view becomes the thesis that " what the law is and what it ought to be " ought to be treated as conceptually distinct sets of norms.339 That is, positivism itself becomes a normative position the defense of which depends on moral judgments about, say, the moral value of the principles of legality. Yet the whole point of the positive turn was to avoid having to make such arguments. # D. Ignoring Jurisprudence : Lawyers ' Assumptions # A natural response to the problems detailed above would be to deny that the positive turn needs to rely on any theory of law at all.340 Sometimes Baude and Sachs seem to assert as much. Sachs suggests that without having " solved all of jurisprudence, " we can fill out the major premise by relying on assumptions " plausible enough for ordinary lawyers to make accurate legal judgments on a routine basis. " 341 He further emphasizes the importance of adopting the perspective of the " faithful participant " in a legal system.342 Meanwhile, Baude " relies on lawyers ' assumptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in practice by looking to case law to support his claim that our law is originalist.344 # So understood, the major premise of this version of the argument would be something like : # MP(0) : The law is whatever makes the best sense of the relevant legal materials. # The supporter of MP(0) need not be embarrassed by the tautological use of " legal " and " relevant " because the whole point of taking the perspective of a " faithful participant " is that one may leave unquestioned certain assumptions about what counts as law. Nor need this view necessarily interpret " best sense " as requiring a normative judgment in the way Dworkin 's demand that judges interpret legal practice in the " best light " does.345 Instead, that phrase could refer to whatever is the most accurate, coherent, and simple explanation of the relevant legal materials. # MP(0) is in many ways an attractive approach for the positive turn because it can ignore all the knotty difficulties thwarting this Article 's efforts to find an acceptable version of MP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what way law depends on a consensus among officials, nor about the implications of disagreement over which facts determine the content of law, nor about the criteria for theory choice among philosophies of law. None of that matters anymore because now the Core Argument just requires making the kinds of arguments lawyers typically make, using the traditional methods and sources of law. # Under this view, Baude and Sachs 's claim is basically that what the best interpretation of our legal practices overall entails-what the law really requires-is that courts trace the pedigree of second-order interpretive rules back to the Founding( or to a valid rule of change). Support for this claim can be found in the fact that in many areas of law, we care about the historical pedigree of legal rules.346 For instance, we chase back chains of title to ensure that a property is fit for sale.347 Moreover, in the context of public law, the ratification of the Constitution is the crucial historical event.348 We do not look for legal authority before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Founding in terms that preserve a sense of continuity with the Founding.349 # That seems like a reasonable sort of argument, but notice two related implications of going down this path. The first is that it would require Baude and Sachs to jettison their efforts to ground their version of methods originalism in " social facts " or " theories of jurisprudence " because those are precisely what tie them in knots. Sachs insists that " we need to know the social facts of how these participants conventionally justify their legal positions and the arguments they 're willing to accept and defend in public. " 350 And both write that " whether our system is textualist, intentionalist, purposivist, or something else is a legal question, to be answered by our sources of law-and, in the end, by the appropriate theory of jurisprudence. " 351 # If we are taking an " internal " or " lawyer 's " approach, this is all pure confusion. The reason is that lawyers do not " conventionally justify " their claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor does the resolution of a " legal question " in a court of law typically depend on a " theory of jurisprudence. " 352 Recall that Hart 's purpose in introducing the concept of the rule of recognition was to show how such a rule was, from one( external) perspective, a mere sociological fact about the attitudes of a certain social group( namely, officials) and yet, from another( internal) perspective, the premise for making the kind of normative statements that pervade the law.353 By establishing a set of criteria for what makes a rule count as " law, " the rule of recognition introduces and makes intelligible the normative concept of " legal validity. " So when a lawyer says that there is " no rule " prohibiting her client 's conduct, she is not understood to be making an empirical claim about the existence or nonexistence of a particular set of " social facts. " Instead, she is making a claim about legal validity based on traditional legal sources. In other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court in a constitutional( or any other) case and say, " well, Judge, my client wins because social facts of the right sort entail that she does, " you may not lose, but you will almost certainly get a look of justified bewilderment from the judge.354 # The second implication of this approach is just the flipside of the first. Adopting MP(0) for the Core Argument means that the " positive turn " no longer qualifies as a methodological innovation because it just describes the most traditional kind of argument that lawyers and legal scholars have been making for centuries. Now, Baude and Sachs may happily concede that point. Their complaint, they might insist, lies with the recent efforts of legal scholars to focus on normative and conceptual questions, at least when it comes to interpretive rules and methods. But of course those scholars would respond that they do so because they are taking up issues on which the law has run out or fails to provide determinate answers.355 # Interestingly, Baude and Sachs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where there is widespread disagreement about the law, there may still be right answers.356 Lawyers and judges are just not seeing what the law, properly understood, really requires. That view-known as the " right answer thesis ' ' -is yet another deeply controversial position that seems to depend on a controversial metaphysics of law that legal philosophers have long debated.357 Whereas Hart denied it, Dworkin once defended it.358 But under MP(0) there is no room to engage in such debates because once you begin making claims about the nature of judicial disagreement over the meaning of legal sources, you must make judgments about what kinds of facts make some rule, text, or principle count as " law. " And then you are doing jurisprudence- perhaps even " technical " jurisprudence.359 And yet under the approach now under consideration, such inquiry is foreclosed. Thus, Baude and Sachs would not be able to look to positivist jurisprudence to either show how certain social facts in general yield determinate legal outcomes or( even if they so wished) show how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political morality, as Dworkin argued.360 # Instead, the only resources available to fill out MP(0) are the sources lawyers rely on( particular statutes, cases, treatises, et cetera) and the methods they use to analyze them( for instance, analogical and deductive reasoning). As noted above, Baude and Sachs do provide some of that sort of conventional legal support for their substantive claims about inclusive and original-law originalism.361 No doubt they and others will continue to make such traditional arguments on behalf of particular originalist views. That is what lawyers and law professors do. But when they do, they need not seek support( because there is none) from a so-called positive turn. # Conclusion : The Dilemma at the Heart of the Positive Turn # The Introduction suggested that the appeal of the positive turn lay in its apparent capacity to bridge the gulf between legal practice and legal scholarship that Chief Justice Roberts 's quip about Bulgarian evidence law highlights.362 Baude and Sachs seek to put theoretical tools to work in service of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself can resolve( or at least " reorient ") some scholarly debates that seem otherwise intractable. A proper understanding of legal philosophy( that is, positivism) directs us to sources from the Founding( that is, originalism). And those sources not only help us decide actual legal cases but also provide a way of refocusing scholarly and theoretical debates over interpretive methodology. In this way, Baude and Sachs aim to reconcile legal theory and practice.363 # Once we followed through the logic of their proposal, however, we ran into various ambiguities that prompted further questions. Are the lawdetermining facts the positivists seek themselves " higher-order " legal rules or brute practices of officials? Are those facts historical facts about the Founding or facts about current judicial practice? Does discovering them require knowing something about the " nature " of law, or can it be done by relying on " lawyers ' assumptions "? # Stepping back, we can now see that these ambiguities all arise from that original ambition to reconcile legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one underlying dilemma : Does the positive turn-and the Core Argument it endorses-involve making " legal " arguments of the sort a lawyer might make to a court? Or does it require theoretical inquiry about law? If the former is the case, then the positive turn is not a methodological advance because it describes what lawyers and legal scholars have traditionally done. But if the latter is the case, then taking the positive turn leads to just the kind of conceptual and normative debates from which the positive turn purported to offer escape. # Dworkin offered one approach to resolving this dilemma. He famously( and controversially) argued that " no firm line divides jurisprudence from adjudication or any other aspect of legal practice. " 364 In his view, philosophical accounts of law are properly developed from the " internal point of view, " which reflects the " practical " interest of those who seek arguments about the " soundness " of particular legal claims.365 The resulting accounts of law are, as we have seen, what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole.366 That is, they are interpretations that put legal practice in the " best light " in essentially the same way that judicial opinions constructively interpret particular legal materials.367 In other words, Dworkin resolved the dilemma by characterizing the philosophical study of law as the natural( if more abstract) development of the traditional forms of argument one sees in law and legal practice. # In some ways, Dworkin 's approach seems to be an attractive route for Baude and Sachs. Dworkin has made repeated appearances throughout this Article( though not in any of the Baude and Sachs papers discussed here) because there is much in his understanding of law that fits Baude and Sachs 's agenda well : not only their ambition to reconcile legal theory and practice but also( as we have already seen) their( a) insistence that law exists even in the absence of consensus about which facts determine the law ; 368( b) privileging of the perspective of the " faithful participant " in legal practice ; 369( c) commitment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @,( d) conviction that right answers may exist, even in hard cases.371 But Baude and Sachs would not only reject Dworkin 's claim that determining law necessarily depends on moral principles ; I suspect they would also likely chafe against the idea( as have many others) that the purpose of legal theory necessarily involves putting legal practice in the " best light. " 372 # My own view is that Dworkin 's approach goes both too far and not far enough. It goes too far in the sense that it characterizes the legal theorist as someone necessarily driven by an agenda-in particular, a rationalizing agenda that aims to justify current practice. But it does not go far enough in the sense that it holds fast to the core distinction between two " perspectives " on legal practice, one " internal " and one " external, " even as it aims to pull legal philosophy over to the " internal " side of that divide. So, for instance, Dworkin argues that sociological and historical accounts of law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests or ideologies that have actually shaped them, are " external " accounts and thus fail to make a dent against " interpretive " arguments.373 # Admittedly, something like Dworkin 's internal/external distinction runs deep in today 's legal-academic culture. Lawyers and legal scholars invoke it to shield certain forms of argument from attack by other disciplines.374 Meanwhile, scholars in other disciplines invoke something like it to distinguish their genuinely epistemic or truth-seeking goals from the " rhetorical " aims of law professors writing about the law.375 The distinction runs so deep, in fact, that recently two law professors claimed that scholars and judges who ignore it risk committing a methodological " fallacy. " 376 # Nevertheless, in my view, the distinction has outlived whatever utility it may once have had and should be abandoned. I will not defend that view here because I have done so elsewhere.377 But the basic idea is that we ought to broaden our understanding both of what " legal practice " properly includes and what genuine intellectual inquiry involves.378 Legal inquiry may involve " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making controversial moral judgments.379 At the same time, historical or social-scientific accounts of why or how law changes can serve as useful and relevant critiques of legal practice and, thereby, make arguments( pace Dworkin) relevant to the " soundness " of legal claims. The key assumption underlying these suggestions is that the methods of reasoning in different disciplines, including law, ultimately differ less than is sometimes assumed. The result is that practitioners of different disciplines may be able to join in more productive debate with one another than the invocation of the " internal/external " distinction would seem to allow.380 # Which brings us back to the positive turn. If I am right about Baude and Sachs 's methodological ambition to reconcile legal practice and legal theory, the view just sketched may offer them one route to doing so. But I doubt it is one that would attract them. That is because it would require them to give up on the positive turn 's promise of showing how our disagreements over legal interpretive techniques can be settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the right facts are, of course). It would mean recognizing instead that the positive turn puts judges and legal scholars right back where they have always been-in a position where they are bombarded by empirical, normative, and conceptual questions of all sorts, and where there is no way to exclude, without cost, one class of those questions from view. Anyone in such a position- whether " inside " or " outside " legal practice-must decide which features of legal practice are worth investigating, which methods are the proper ones for doing so, and how to proceed once the investigation is complete. Such choices, like any choice about what to do, ultimately involve both intellectual and moral considerations.381 If the positive turn, in its failure, reminds us of that inescapable predicament, then it may have served a useful function after all.

The precise meaning of this distinction, too, has been the subject of debate. For an analysis of some of the ambiguities in Hart 's primary/secondary rule distinction, see NEIL MacCormick, H.L.A. Hart 55-88( 2d ed. 2008), which discusses Hart 's distinction between " duty-imposing " and " power-conferring " rules. # 138. Hart, supra note 20, at 81( borrowing a phrase from Austin) ; see also Austin, supra note 20, at 11. # 139. Some dispute that Hart sought to show how law could generate genuine normative obligations. See, e.g., Brian Leiter, Beyond the Hart/Dworkin Debate : The Methodology Problem in Jurisprudence, 48 Am. J. Juris. 17, 38( 2003)( " Hart has nothing to say about the normativity of law in the main text of The Concept of Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) ; Scott J. Shapiro, What Is the Internal Point of View?, 75 Fordham L.

But see Veronica Rodriguez-Blanco, Peter Winch and H.L.A. Hart : Two Concepts of the Internal Point of View, 20 Can. J.L. &amp; Juris. 453, 460( 2007)( interpreting Hart as seeking to explain how " rules give reasons for actions "). But for reasons I have provided elsewhere, the better reading, in my view, is that Hart did set for himself that goal. Barzun, supra note 22, at 1224 n.65. For what it is worth, one of Hart 's biographers takes the same view. See Nicola Lacey, A Life of H.L.A. Hart : The Nightmare and the Noble Dream 228( 2004)( " Herbert was never convinced that he had satisfactorily resolved this dilemma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligation in law : he returned frequently to the issue, trying to capture the precise sense in which law, its existence in his view a matter of social fact, generates genuine obligations to conform to its duty-imposing rules.

The other necessary condition is that there be general compliance with the system 's primary rules of obligation. See id. at 116. To be precise, this foundational, accepted rule is what Hart calls the " ultimate " rule of recognition. Id. at 107. But Hart frequently omits the " ultimate " when discussing the rule of recognition, as have subsequent theorists. See, e.g., id. at 110( explaining that the " rule of recognition exists only as a complex, but normally concordant, practice of the courts, officials, and private persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) ; Matthew D. Adler, Constitutional Fidelity, the Rule of Recognition, and the Communitarian Turn in Contemporary Positivism, 75 Fordham L. Rev. 1671, 1671( 2006)( " A legal system exists only if the system 's rule of recognition, stating its ultimate criteria of legal validity, is accepted by the persons who count as officials within that system-only if those persons adopt the internal point of view towards the rule of recognition. "). Hart also sometimes used the term in its singular form, e.g., Hart, supra note 20, at 100, and sometimes in its plural form, e.g., id. at 95. # 144. Hart, supra note 20, at 94. # 145.

One might instead say that courts engage in a very cursory kind of pedigree analysis insofar as they typically cite a previous decision in which the court has relied on the rule or method, as in the examples discussed earlier in this Subpart.

Pojanowski and Walsh hint at this problem as well. See Pojanowski &amp; Walsh, supra note 5, at 113( " The positive turn can not identify originalism as our law if there is substantial disagreement about the rule of recognition. "). But they do not further develop the point. They also seem to conflate the problem disagreement poses for the rule of recognition with a methodological objection to Hart 's descriptive form of conceptual analysis. See id. at 113-14.

The same could be said of the argument in Sachs 's earlier article, which defends the coherence of the idea that a constitutional theory( such as originalism) could exist " in exile " -that is, while not currently enforced by courts. See Sachs, supra note 41, at 2255, 2261. Sachs argues that it is possible for courts to be in " global error " as to what the law requires. See id. at 2261, 2268. The reason is that even if what courts actually do becomes radically divorced from our shared higher-order practices( such as the hierarchical structure of legal reasoning), one can still talk intelligibly about the " law " that courts pervasively ignore. Cf id. at 2256. Sachs may be right about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. As Sachs recognizes, for Hart the validity of a rule depends on its satisfaction of the rule of recognition, which exists as a " complex, but normally concordant, practice of the courts, officials, and private persons in identifying the law by reference to certain criteria. " Id. at 2264( quoting Hart, supra note 20, at 110). It follows under this view that a rule no court applies can not be law. Sachs may have been misled into thinking he can enlist Hart on his behalf by Hart 's observation that compliance with a rule is a distinct conceptual question from its validity. See id.( noting that on Hart 's view, there is " no necessary connection between the validity of any particular rule and its efficacy "( emphasis omitted)( quoting Hart, supra note 20, at 103)). But there Hart was talking about a rule 's efficacy as a matter of guiding the conduct of those people to whom the rule has been applied-assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supra note 20, at 103. He was not talking about a rule that is ineffective because no courts apply it. See id. And that makes all the difference because for Hart, as we have seen, the social practice on which law depends is the practice of courts and officials( and perhaps some " private persons, " such as lawyers), not that of most people living under the law.

See Shapiro, supra note 115, at 385. Of course, none of this is to deny that it is possible to run such an argument without any moral premises.

Pojanowski and Walsh aim to provide precisely such an account-one based on the natural law philosophy of John Finnis. See Pojanowski &amp; Walsh, supra note 5, at 110-26. # 338.
