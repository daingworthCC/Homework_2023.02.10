4004641 While research in physical education has been conducted for over fifty years within the United States, it is only during the 1980s that teacher education researchers have started to focus on the influence of the teaching practice experience on physical education student teachers. These efforts may in part have been encouraged by the call from one of the leading figures in physical education teacher preparation, Larry Locke, who in 1979 stated : <p> <p>... if we are to improve student teaching, we must understand it... The appropriate question at this stage is not Are we right? ' but What is out there? '( p. 68). <p> <p> Further impetus for research in this area has also been generated by the realization that the student teaching practice is the most influential of all the experiences included in the teacher preparation process. This is true for both classroom( Book, Byers &; Freeman, 1983), and physical education student teachers( Locke, 1979). <p> One researcher in physical education who has taken a particular interest in the student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and concerns of physical education student teachers is Schempp( 1988 ; 1986 ; 1985 &; 1983). He has stated( 1985) that : <p> <p> If the teaching act is to be improved through the student teaching experience, it appears imperative to understand the conceptions and perceptions of those who perform in that role( p. 159) <p> <p> This view expressed by Schempp( 1985) also gains support from the work of Placek and Dodds( 1988). They suggest that historically teacher educators have paid minimal attention to the views and beliefs that their students already hold concerning the teaching process. However, this acknowledgment of prior student predispositions would seem important because there is evidence that suggests such personally held perceptions influence prospective teachers in their own teaching and learning behaviors( Clark &; Yinger, 1979). <p> Much of the research into the student teaching experience in physical education has data limitations in terms of generalization. This is due to the use of small study samples that have often been derived from an individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do provide some interesting and useful considerations for those teacher educators involved in both college and field-based experiences. <p> The research suggests that physical education student teachers are mainly concerned with their ability to control and manage the children in their classes( Boggess, McBride &; Griffey, 1985 ; Schempp, 1988). This concern appears to remain quite consistent throughout the teaching practice( Boggess et al., 1985). In fact, Schempp( 1985) found that the managerial function appeared to be a major criterion in student teacher perception of the " better teacher. " Further, both Placek( 1983) and Schempp( 1985) indicated that physical education student teachers highlighted ineffective managerial performance as the leading indicator of non-successful teaching. <p> Arrighi and Young( 1987) in their research found that physical education student teachers were more concerned with self rather than children. This represented a shift in student teacher perceptions as initial data indicated they entered teaching practice with greater emphasis on pupil learning orientations. Schempp( 1986) also indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and failing decreased over the duration of the teaching practice. In fact, the concept of children learning motor skills in physical education did not appear to have a significant relationship to physical education student teacher role satisfaction( Schempp, 1983). <p> As Locke( 1984) has suggested, student teaching offers the prospective teacher the opportunity to test and confirm commitment to career choice, learn their role in the gym, and develop the skills and attitudes required to function in the school system. However, as Boggess et al.,( 1985) indicate, by the end of the teaching practice the student teachers in their study may have been "... questioning the worth of teaching as a career choice "( p. 211). This is a disconcerting finding considering that one purpose of the teaching practice should be to send prospective physical education teachers out into the teaching profession, with a positive sense of career purpose. <p> Consequently, the purpose of the present study was to identify and describe incidents that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, which led them to confirm or question their career choice. Again, as Boggess et al.,( 1985) suggest, being able to help student teachers focus on events that have been indicated as confirming career choice, and to understand those events that have led to career questioning, may help more physical education student teachers answer "... yes to the question, ' Is teaching really worth it? ' "( p. 211). Therefore the data produced by the present research might prove useful to teacher educators responsible for working with preservice physical educators on teaching practice. Methods and Procedures Subjects <p> Respondents for this study were 8 female and 18 male( N = 26), Slippery Rock University health and physical education student teachers. These student teachers were all seniors graduating with state K-12 health and physical education teacher certification and baccalaureate degree after the completion of their student teaching practice. All these student teachers completed their 16 week teaching practice in rural, suburban or urban school settings situated in southwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two teaching practice settings. The majority experienced the traditional teaching practice situation with half the semester spent observing/teaching at the elementary level, and half at the middle and/or high school level. The other student teachers spent their 16 week experience observing/teaching at a Teaching Center, which enabled them to work at the elementary and secondary levels continuously throughout the semester. Each student teacher was supervised by one university supervisor, and worked with between two and five cooperating teachers over the duration of the teaching practice. Research Instrument <p> The researcher wanted the data for this study to be derived directly from both the context and the perceptions of the respondents, without any a priori limitations being imposed. Consequently, the instrument used to collect data for this study was the critical incident report form( Flanagan, 1954). Respondents were asked to provide specific, concrete details regarding persons, words, conditions and activities that were involved in incidents during teaching practice they identified as being examples of career confirmation or question. Data Collection <p> Data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successive semesters. Each respondent provided on two occasions a critical incident report focusing on first, incidents that confirmed the student teacher in their career choice, and then-incidents that led the respondent to question their career choice. The respondents provided from one to four incidents in their confirmation and question reports. These reports were written during approximately the eighth and sixteenth week of the teaching practice. The data were collected on both occasions during the semester at a campus based seminar. A total of 121 critical incidents were reported( 67 confirming, 54 questioning) and analyzed. Data Analyses <p> The critical incident reports of confirmation and questioning were analyzed together. This allowed the researcher to group reported incidents and develop a classification system that involved the construction of major categories and subcategories. By combining the incidents of confirmation and question to help produce standardized major categories, it was felt that more meaningful comparisons could be made between these two data forms. <p> The development of the major categories involved the researcher in reading and rereading the critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of incidents. This inductive form of analysis saw the emergence of three major categories. Certain incidents referred specifically to comments and actions made by other people about the development, influence and effect of the respondents during the teaching practice. This was categorized as Positive or Negative Feedback from Others. <p> Further incidents referred to specific student teacher actions or pupil actions/attitudes that directly effected the outcome of respondents ' lessons. These were categorized as Effective or Ineffective Lesson Characteristics. The third classification involved incidents categorized as Positive or Negative Factors External to the Lesson. This category included incidents that occurred outside of the respondent 's lesson and did not involve the student teacher in receiving specific feedback from others on their teaching. <p> Subcategories were then developed from the data to allow a more detailed description of the emergent meanings that had formed the basis for the major categories. A more detailed description of the subcategories is provided in the discussion section of the study. Seventy confirmation and 55 questioning determinants were identified from the data to form the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not match the number of critical incident reports provided( ie. confirming = 67, questioning = 54) is that on a few occasions more than one determinant was evident in a single critical incident. The data were analyzed and presented( ie. Table 1-5) utilizing descriptive statistics. Results are reported by rank, frequency and percentage. Data Classification Reliability <p> To help assess researcher category reliability both inter-rater and intra-rater exact agreement calculations were used. Two persons not involved with the study acted as judges for inter-rater purposes. Having had the three major categories and the specific subcategories carefully defined for them, the two judges were asked to place an identical sample of 20 randomly selected data determinants into what they perceived to be the relevant categories. Comparison of the two judges and researcher inter-rater classifications indicated exact agreement results of 85% and above. <p> An intra-rater reliability check was carried out by the researcher one week after the inter-rater process. This involved the re-categorization of the 20 previously used data determinants. This analysis produced an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inter and intra-rater procedures suggested the study data categorization was reliable. Results <p> The results of this study are presented in terms of the intent of the research. The purpose was to identify and describe incidents that student teachers ' actually focused on during the teaching practice, which led them to confirm or question their career choice. <p> In terms of the classification of determinants of career confirmation by major category, positive feedback from others was the most frequently reported( 54.3%). This was followed by incidents categorized under effective lesson characteristics( 38.6%). The third category related to positive factors external to the lesson( 7.1%). Results for determinants of career confirmation by major category are presented in Table 1. <p> Determinants of career questioning by major category indicate ineffective lesson characteristics as the most frequently reported classification( 58.2). Negative factors external to the lesson ranked second( 40.0%), with negative feedback from others in a distant third position with only one report( 1.8%). Results for the determinants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Results by subcategory for career confirmation indicate that five different groups had a positive influence on these student teachers. In terms of positive feedback from others( ie. 1st major category) that encouraged the respondents to feel they had made the correct career choice, student on-going( 36.8%) and summative( 21.1%) reaction ranked one and two. This is followed by the cooperating teacher( 18.4%), other teachers( 10.5%), parents( 7.9%) and in sixth position, the university supervisor( 5.3%). <p> Student learning( 44.4%), motivated students( 33.3%) and successful activities( 22.2%) are the three subcategories that define the second ranked major category for career confirmation, effective lesson characteristics. Helping individual students( 100.0%) was the only subcategory defining the third ranked major category, positive factors external to the lesson. Results for determinants of career confirmation by subcategory are presented in Table 3. <p> Analysis by subcategory of career questioning indicate that off-task class behavior was the most frequently reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ineffective lesson characteristics. off-task individual behavior( 24.2%) and unmotivated students( 24.2%) shared the second rank subcategory position. <p> Lack of employment opportunities( 28.5%) and unprofessional staffroom talk( 28.5%) were the joint leading subcategories in the second major category of negative factors external to the lesson. Legal liability concern( 23.8%) was the third rank subcategory in this area. only one report was provided in the subcategory student teacher-decisions questioned( 100.0%) which defined the third ranked major category, negative feedback from others. Complete results for determinants of career questioning by subcategory are provided in Table 4. <p> In terms of comparative analysis by subcategory the top three determinants for career confirmation were, on-going student reaction( 20.0%), student learning( 17.1%) and motivated students( 12.9%). For career questioning the leading three subcategories were off-task class behavior( 21.8%), off-task individual behavior( 14.6%) and unmotivated students( 14.6%). Comparison of the top six determinants by subcategory for both career confirmation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of this study was to identify and describe the incidents that student teachers actually focused on during the teaching practice, which lead them to confirm or question their career choice. The results were derived from the critical incident responses of 26 health and physical education student teachers from Slippery Rock University. While generalization can not be claimed for these results due to the small sample, and nonrandom procedures used, some interesting insights and further research questions do emerge from the data. <p> The results indicate that these student teachers without specific researcher direction provided more confirmation determinants( ie. 70), than questioning( ie. 55) in their critical incident reports. Although the data does not provide a reason for this fact, it is reassuring to think that there appear to have been more confirming than questioning experiences occurring for these respondents during their teaching practice. <p> The majority of the confirming determinants( 54.3%) centered around positive feedback statements and actions from others. This feedback focused on informing student teachers ' about their development, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, it is interesting to note that the feedback major category received minimal response( ranked 3rd, 1.8%) when it came to identifying determinants that led to career questioning. The leading major category for student teacher career questioning centered on ineffective lesson characteristics( 58.2%), which conversely placed second in rank for career confirmation( 38.6). <p> Some interesting findings emerge from the above results. It seems that these student teachers predominantly identified career confirmation through knowledge of performance directly supplied by external sources( ie. others). In particular the majority of this feedback was provided by their own students. <p> Subcategory analysis indicates the respondents focused on two forms of student feedback. First, there was clear reference to on-going student reaction. Here children indicated verbally and nonverbally( e.g. hugging) that they enjoyed the student teacher 's lesson, or had experienced learning, or simply liked having the student teacher as their teacher. Second, there was very specific reference to summative student reaction. A number of respondents were clearly effected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards, parties) toward them. In fact three respondents commented that they did not realize the children had such positive perceptions of them until this final day reaction. <p> Further, the subcategories defining positive feedback from others also indicate that after their students, it is the cooperating teacher who is the next most frequently identified source for student teacher career confirmation. This finding supports the research( Bunting, 1988) that suggests the critical role of the cooperating teacher in relation to the student teacher. However, the least frequently mentioned provider of confirming feedback for these student teachers is the university supervisor. <p> This finding concerning the influence of the university supervisor raises an interesting question. Why does the one figure who most closely represents the connection between the collegebased teacher preparation program, and the major in-field experience, have so little influence on student teacher career confirmation? Would the supervisors ' influence in this area have been more frequently identified by the student teachers, if more than 6-7 site visits during the 16 week teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the student teacher be more closely related to the type of supervisor feedback provided( e.g. systematic or subjective)? Again these represent further research questions, the answers to which could lead to the positive development of the university supervisors role. <p> Clearly, for these student teachers what has been categorized as ineffective lesson characteristics are the determinants most frequently identified as leading them to question their career choice. This finding seems to relate to earlier critical incident research( Placek &; Dodds, 1988 ; Schempp, 1985), which indicated physical education student teachers focused on lesson events and conditions when defining teaching nonsuccess and ineffectiveness. <p> In the present study, subcategory analysis indicates that it is childrens ' off-task class and individual behavior, along with lack of pupil motivation that dominates student teachers ' perceptions of ineffective lesson characteristics. Again, this finding confirms past research( Arrighi &; Young, 1987 ; Placek, 1983) that physical education student teachers perceive inappropriate childrens ' response as the prime example of non-successful teaching. <p> Student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schempp( 1985) and Placek and Dodds( 1988), did not place major emphasis on the identification of student learning as a confirming determinant. only approximately one in six( 17.1%) determinants of career confirmation indicated the student teachers specifically focusing on children learning. <p> However, in this study, comparative analysis by subcategory did indicate that student learning was the second most frequently reported determinant of career conformation. This, at least, is a positive finding considering the growing emphasis today on teacher accountability in terms of children learning. Yet we still need to know why this instructional objective is not perceived as being particularly important in career confirmation by more student teachers. <p> A further interesting finding is that these respondents also identified career questioning experiences occurring for them, outside of the lesson environment. Lack of employment opportunities, unprofessional staffroom talk and legal liability concerns dominate the second ranked major category, negative factors external to the lesson. The critical incident reports suggest that a number of these student teachers were now acknowledging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations. Before teaching practice such determinants of career questioning had only been theory in teacher preparation courses. Conclusions <p> In conclusion it appears that the following suggestions might be made based on the study results. First, it is clear how important receiving positive feedback from others is to student teachers, particularly from their own students. Further, the influence of the cooperating teacher and the minimal influence of the university supervisor in the area of student teacher career confirmation is indicated. <p> This emphasis on positive feedback suggests the need for careful selection of student teaching practice sites. Such sites should, in part, be determined in relation to the ability of cooperating teachers to provide sustained, positively phrased feedback to student teachers. If such cooperating teacher abilities are not particularly evident in selected sites, then the opportunity to develop these skills should at least be offered to teachers by the university teacher preparation department. <p> The results of this study suggest that some assessment of childrens ' response toward health( if a dual certification) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site selection. Children in this study were clearly the major contributors toward student teacher career confirmation and question. <p> University teacher preparation programs may also want to take a role in assessing those factors that are highlighted by student teacher evaluations, with regard to the university supervisory process. Such departmental self analysis may help in the development of a supervisory structure that allows the university supervisor to play a more influential, positive role during teaching practice. <p> Finally, student-teachers may also need some help in giving meaning to the many situations they meet in the reality of the teaching practice, and placing the appropriate amount of emphasis on these events. Consequently, it is only through the study of this vital teacher preparation experience that those school-based and university personnel involved with the student teacher, can hope to become more influential. This influence should be directed toward helping the student teachers in their development of a positive, yet realistic picture of the schoolteacher 's life. A picture that hopefully confirms our future generations of health and physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Percentage based on total number of confirmation determinants( N = 70) and total number of questioning determinants( N = 55). <p>
