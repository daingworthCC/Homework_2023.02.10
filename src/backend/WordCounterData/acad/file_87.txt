4012641 Y a-t-il des mots pour la peinture? <p> -- Francis Ponge <p> One need only peruse the long list of texts Ponge devoted to art during the latter half of his life to conclude that painting was a subject of predilection for the author of Le Parti pris des choses. 1 Indeed, thanks to the " verbal still lifes " 2 that comprise his 1942 prose poem collection, Ponge gained considerable notoriety among painters by the time the war came to an end. After the war, no doubt encouraged by the enthusiastic response of artists who had read his work, Ponge began to compose texts in praise of painters who, like the poet, " goutent au supreme degre le mystere, l'obscurite de la matiere et de la nature des choses "( L'Atelier contemporain 312). 3 <p> Traces of Ponge 's interest in painting, however, are not limited to texts published in such collections as Le Nouveau recueil( 1967) or L'Atelier contemporain( 1977). 4 Before Ponge met any of the artists that would one day admire his work, he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, evidence of Ponge 's interest in painting can be found in some of his earliest writings. In his first prose poem, " La promenade dans nos serres "( 1919), for example, Ponge praises the visual qualities of words as they emerge from his pen like lines from the painter 's brush. 6 Similarly, despite the predominance in Proemes of words that stress the distinctly verbal nature of Ponge 's project( " l'avenir des paroles, " " de la modification des choses par la parole, " " caprices de la parole, " " phrases sorties du songe, " " il n'y a pas a dire, " etc.), phrases such as " boucles superbes des consonnes " or " le **36;497;TOOLONG " found elsewhere in Proemes suggest a conscious desire to " visualize " language and to " verbalize " visual forms. From the beginning, it would appear that visual art forms provided an invaluable key to opening a door on the world of poetry as Ponge understood it. <p> Critics have frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry, interpreting the consciously visual, material role that language plays in a variety of ways. 7 Particular attention has been granted to the importance of the physical presence of words in the poet 's encounter with things in Le Patti pris des choses. If, in " Les mures, " for example, blackberry bushes are described as " des buissons typographiques constitues par le pomme " or the sea in " Bords de mer " is perceived as " un livre qui au fond n'a pas ete lu, " it is because, for Ponge, poetic language -- and specifically poetry as printed text -- is of the same order as the things it evokes. This characteristic of Ponge 's style can also be related to his view of painting : reference to typography and books in a collection of prose poems ostensibly about things is part of Ponge 's lifelong attempt to call his reader 's attention to the material presence of words, just as the painters Ponge most often identifies with call our attention to the materiality of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, <p> Sans doute, les ecrivains et les peintres sont-ils des hommes comme les autres, peut-etre un peu plus sensibles seulement, c'est-a-dire( si l'on m'a bien compris) un peu plus realistes( un peu plus materialistes, si vous voulez). Seuls, d'ailleurs, il faut bien le dire, h n'etre sensibles qu'au sensible, c'est-a-dire au present. Seuls " a etre entierement presents. Seuls, si je puis dire, a y etre, integralement. Seuls a y rester.( L'Atelier contemporain 305-306) <p> In light of Ponge 's awareness of prose poetry 's concreteness, it is hardly surprising that Braque and Picasso should be drawn to Le Parti pris des choses, not only because such writing concerns " things " -- the privileged subject of nonabstract painters --, but also because of the ostensibly thing-like nature of the poet 's words. Just as painters are able, in Ponge 's words, to " prendre a la nature ses elements "( L'Atelier contemporain 64), so too does Ponge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him, so to speak, to " prendre a la peinture son bien, " thus creating a poetry that promotes the word 's physical presence, its semantic density. 9 <p> By distancing himself in his poetry from words that do not and can not belong exclusively to him, Ponge opens his prose poetry up to the concrete, material traces of the voices of others. In the following, I would like to explore how this incursion of otherness functions in one of the least commented works in Le Patti pris des choses, " Le Restaurant Lemeunier, rue de la Chaussee d'Antin. " 10 This poem is of particular interest in the present context, inasmuch as Ponge bases his description of the restaurant space on images drawn from the plastic arts, in particular Manet 's ground-breaking work, Un Bar aux Folies-Bergbre( 1882)( see figure 1). 11 If, as Ponge would state in 1971, painters and poets enjoy a special kind of kinship or " fraternite "( L'Atelier contemporain 308), such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Restaurant Lemeunier, rue de la Chaussee d'Antin, " where Ponge invites us to " picture " his work as a reaffirmation of Manet 's modernist aesthetic. <p> Early in the poem, Ponge compares Lemeunier 's Restaurant with two specific paintings, both of which bring to mind certain aspects of the restaurant 's size and decor : <p> C'est une grande composition digne du Veronese pour l'ambition et le volume, mais qu'il faudrait peindre tout entiare dans l'esprit du fameux Bar de Manet. <p> In this passage, use of the elliptical title " Bar " and " le Veronese " testifies to Ponge 's familiarity with visual art in both its traditional and modern forms. Although Ponge does not go on to explain how Veronese 's painting -- no doubt his immense The Wedding Feast at Cana( see figure 2), located in the Louvre-fails where Manet 's Bar succeeds in providing the visual equivalent of his prose poem, a closer look at Veronese 's painting reveals fundamental differences that will later help us appreciate the role of Manet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination, Veronese 's portrayal of the marriage feast, during which water was miraculously turned into wine, brings to mind several aspects of Lemeunier 's Restaurant( see figure 2). The place occupied by the group of musicians -- what Ponge calls " les personnages dominants " -- in the middle of the restaurant, for example, corresponds to the centrality of the musicians, one of whom until recently was believed to be Veronese himself, 13 in The Wedding Feast at Cana. The poem and painting also share a clear thematic similarity, as is underscored by the fact that The Wedding Feast at Cana was originally created to cover the wall of a dining facility -- the refectory in the monastery of San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice -- from which Napoleon had it removed and brought to Paris in the early nineteenth century. <p> Though certain aspects of Veronese 's work provide interesting parallels with the subject of Ponge 's prose poem, important distinctions exist as well. The biblical miracle depicted in The Wedding Feast, for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bustle of Ponge 's restaurant scene. The viewer 's fixed perspective on the wedding feast also makes it seem an unlikely model for Ponge 's prose poem. In Veronese 's painting, all objects are related to a single point of view. Our perception of Lemeunier 's restaurant in Ponge 's poem is, to the contrary, multiple. Although the poem 's plot is straightforward, the distinctly flaneur-like narrator does not always occupy a fixed place in the restaurant, nor is his identity always certain. 14 The affective components of the poem 's narration( degree of subjectivity, intimacy of tone) occasionally shift as well. Only briefly, for example, does use of the first person singular cast a subjective light on Ponge 's poem : " Comme dans une grotte merveilleuse, je les vois tous parler et rire mais ne les entends pas. " Elsewhere in the poem, Ponge adopts the third-person singular, as in the closing paragraph : " l'homme qui attend lies serveuses n'apertioit plus qu'une vaste menagerie de chaises et de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is being observed by Ponge 's erstwhile first-person flaneur, or whether he may be the flaneur himself, observed from a different vantage point by a new and unidentified narrator. Clearly, such shifts depart from the fixed perspective of Veronese 's Wedding. 15 <p> In addition to differences in perspective, the striking chromatic juxtapositions in Veronese 's vibrant painting are all but forgotten in the " monde des fadeurs et des fadaises " of Ponge 's urban portrait. And though " Le Restaurant Lemeunier " shares with Veronese 's canvas a certain effusiveness, the exaggerated gestures of Lemeunier 's guests and staff -- " ceremonieusement attifes, " immersed in " un brouhaha recrudescent de chaises repoussees, de torchons claquants, de croutons ecrases " -- present a degraded image of smug routine that departs from the extraordinary nature of the event depicted in The Wedding Feast at Cana. <p> Ponge also appears to make little effort to blend harmoniously the different strands of social discourse present in the restaurant, allowing them instead to compete for our attention in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and profane elements, Ponge plots one voice against another. To be sure, the narrator traces the different events in the order in which they occur : the poem opens with our entrance into the restaurant followed by a description of the staff and patrons, then, in the closing paragraphs, the exit of the dinner guests, the cleaning of the restaurant, and departure of the waitresses. Such a straightforward narrative progression is, however, forced to coexist with many less homogeneous elements of the text. The underlying dissonance between the musicians ' performance and other, less agreeable sounds -- described at one point as " le tapage des fourchettes et des assiettes choquees, les appels des serveuses et le bruit des conversations, " for example -- does little to nurture a sense of harmony and order in the setting. The garishness of everything in the restaurant, from the effusive Viennese waltzes to the bevelled mirrors and gilded trimmings, belittles the feelings exchanged there. In an apostrophe such as " O confidence, c'est @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as objective a phrase as " Pieces et billets bleus s'echangent sur les tables, " monetary considerations impinge noticeably upon the domain of intimacy. <p> Such characteristics of Ponge 's " Restaurant Lemeunier, " while distancing it from Veronese 's Wedding Feast, simultaneously illustrate the poem 's close affinity with Manet 's Bar. If, for example, we return to the problematic question of narrative perspective, we find that the flaneur 's place in Lemeunier 's Restaurant, though finding little parallel in Veronese 's Wedding Feast, calls to mind the ambiguous position of the male customer in Manet 's painting( see figure 1). The image of the stranger to the extreme right of the mirror 's reflection, neither central to Manet 's canvas nor absent from it, suggests an unwillingness on the part of Manet to assign the place of prominence within his painting to that of the male observer. To the contrary, the centrality of the barmaid in Un Bar aux Folies-Bergere, like the working girls in the closing lines of Ponge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and, in terms of perspective, awkward position in the mirror 's reflection. The fact that the stranger in the mirror does not occupy the place where he should logically be located -- that is to say directly behind the barmaid and not to her left -- renders not only his, but Manet 's and our own positions as observers of the barmaid in the painting, ambiguous at best. 16 Ponge 's remark that the flaneur, at one point, is able to " see " but not " hear " the restaurant 's patrons( " je les vois tous parler et rire mais ne les entends pas ") suggests a further point of comparison between the text 's anonymous male customer and viewers of Manet 's painting. <p> Fragments of events that extend beyond the canvas of Manet 's work -- like the legs left dangling from a trapeze in the upper left-hand corner -- suggest that Manet is not attempting to represent the Folies-Bergere as a whole, nor is his primary subject dance-hall entertainment. In similar fashion, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the restaurant, from " des cupules d'un metal mysterieux, " to " une dactylo magnifiquement ondulee, " to " une vaste menagerie de chaises et de tables, " without ever privileging his contemplation of any one aspect of the restaurant 's space. As readers, we are prevented from dwelling for any length of time on one object before moving on to the next. <p> Certain aspects of his text echo the actual physical layout of Manet 's painting as well. The gold-framed mirror and the balcony on the far side of the room in Un Bar aux Folies-Bergere, for example, reappear in Ponge 's depiction of Lemeunier 's Restaurant : <p> Des glaces biseautees, des dorures partout. L'on y entre a travers des plantes vertes par un passage plus sombre aux parois duquel quelques dineurs deja a l'etroit sont installes, et qui debouche dans une salle aux proportions enormes, a plusieurs balcons de pitchpin formant un seul etage en huit. <p> While it would no doubt be possible to extend comparison of Manet 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengthy considerations of color and imagery, the mirror 's role in problematizing our perspective on the dance hall certainly does the most to bring poem and painting together. The lack of depth in Manet 's painting, its insistence on surfaces, unlike the infinite sky of Veronese 's Wedding Feast, presents the viewer with a two-dimensional space. Like Manet 's mirror, where reality is purposely distorted -- where the barmaid seen in reflection, for example, does not correspond to the one gazing out at us from behind the counter --, Ponge 's text fails to project a purely mimetic representation of the restaurant space. The " grotte merveilleuse " to which Ponge compares the restaurant at one point indeed distorts our perception of reality. In Ponge 's case, this distortion is not exclusively visual ; it is verbal as well. " Le Restaurant Lemeunier " is a place where writing begins to experiment in its contact with the real ; the text becomes an " atelier " where the poet teases out society 's conflicting sounds by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like the crowd that lines the balcony reflected on the flat surface of Manet 's mirror, the different registers of speech cramped into the small space of Ponge 's prose poem are forced to inhabit the same plane. Expressions like " mettre la main a la pate, " " jouer du tube de fard, " " tirer son epingle du " remuer les estomacs et les coeurs, " and " vouloir comme il faut etonner leurs voisins " -- the last of which, as presented in the text, forms an alexandrine mascarading as cheap poetry -- are all bits and pieces of the rich vernacular eloquence Ponge extracts from the otherwise insipid image that the management of Lemeunier 's Restaurant has contrived for its dinner guests. In the following passage, similarly, Ponge suggests a variety of linguistic registers by use of a series of highly ironic poses imparting first sarcastic delight, then condemnation, then again pleasant surprise, only to end on a note of trite conformity : <p> O monde des fadeurs et des fadaises, tu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ y singe quotidiennement cette frivolite tapageuse que les bourgeois se permettent huit ou dix fois par an, quand le pere banquiet ou la mere kleptomane ont realise quelque benefice supplementaire vraiment inattendu, et veulent comme il faut etonner leurs voisins. <p> Use of the adverbial phrase " comme il faut " to emphasize the social motives underlying the parents ' desire to dine out is perhaps the most clamorous intervention of stylized discourse in the poem. Here, Ponge appropriates a phrase commonly identified with middle-class mores to describe the actions of persons belonging to that group. Instead of simply placing the conversational hurly-burly of the restaurant crowd within the quotation marks of direct discourse, Ponge allows it to pervade his descriptive prose. This aspect of the text can be related to Ponge 's efforts, mentioned earlier, to dispel the notion that poetry, as a means of expression, lacks the concreteness found in the plastic arts. What better way for Ponge to stress the material presence of the crowd 's words than by pasting them, so to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The poet 's tendency to emphasize the mercantile nature of Lemeunier 's Restaurant also distances his approach from that of Veronese, while simultaneously underscoring its resemblance to Manet. In Manet 's Bar, despite the Folies-Bergere 's fame as a place of leisure, the central role is accorded to an employee, the barmaid, whose listless expression belies any potential interpretation of the scene as one of pure diversion. Similarly, whereas Lemeunier 's Restaurant constitutes a space within which society strives to makes its presence seem " natural, " Ponge does little to hide the fact that economic concerns -- embodied in the image of the elevated cashiers, " assises en surelevation derriere leurs banques " -- reign supreme. In the following passage, the poet 's attention suddenly shifts from the musicians to the decidedly unglamorous realities of job availability : <p> Les personnages dominants y sont sans contredit d'abord le groupe des musiciens au noeud du huit, puis les caissieres assises en surelevation derriere leurs banques, d ' ou ' leurs corsages clairs et obligatoirement gonfles tout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulent avec une relative lenteur, mais obliges parfois a mettre la main a la pate avec la meme precipitation que les serveuses, non par l'impatience des dineurs( peu habituos a l'exigence) mais par la febrilite d'un zele professionnel aiguillonne par le sentiment de l'incertitude des situations dans l'etat actuel de l'offre et de la demande sur le marche du travail. <p> Toward the end of his poem, similarly, the poet lingers deliberately on the responsibilities of the cleaning staff, whose work begins once the dinner guests have left the premises : " peu a peu se propage et a huis clos s'acheve un soulevement general du mobilier, a la faveur duquel les besognes humides du nettoyage sont aussitot entreprises et sans embarras terminees. " Money and drudgery quickly undermine the restaurant 's charm. Like the apparent fatigue of the barmaid in Un Bar aux Folies-Bergere, the details of Ponge 's descriptive prose bring to our attention aspects of Lemeunier 's Restaurant that underlie the glitter of urban leisure. It is important to note, however, that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant work do not turn his poem into a text about labor in its struggle to be heard. On the contrary, Ponge does not privilege any particular voice at the cost of filtering out or altering another. Neither strictly a dinner guest nor entirely an objective stranger unimplicated in the scene he observes, Ponge 's flaneur is sympathetic to the working girls who, at the end of the day, count the few coins " qui tintent au fond de leur poche, " but he is also one of the customers on whose money their livelihood depends. <p> In " Le Restaurant Lemeunier, " in short, Ponge refuses to " paint " an image of " la vie moderne " in which the struggle of competing voices might somehow be aesthetically resolved. Just as in the case of Manet 's Bar, it is via the deliberate destabilization of the viewing perspective that such tensions are most emphatically brought to the forefront. In both cases, this destabilization extends beyond the boundaries of the work to envelop the reader/spectator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but to ponder their implications. <p> A brief look at Zola 's attempt to reform public opinion of Manet can help us appreciate the insight Ponge brings to Manet 's Bar in " Le Restaurant Lemeunier. " As early as 1866, Zola sought to defend Manet in a series of articles with which he hoped to bring the public to respect the painter 's work at a time when it was becoming a subject of mockery and caricature : " Il y a route une armee, " Zola writes, " do nt l'interet est d'entretenir la gaiete de la louie, et qui l'entretient d'une belle facon. Les caricaturistes s'emparent de l'homme et de l'oeuvre "( 12 : 842) 17 In order to restore seriousness to the reception of Manet 's work, Zola first dispels the popular image of Manet as a bohemian, as an outsider : " Edouard Manet est homme du monde, et il y a dans ses tableaux certaines lignes exquises, certaines attitudes greles et jolies qui temoignent de son amour pour les elegances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a number of Manet 's paintings, including Un Bar aux FoliesBergere, have their origin in public spaces of a decidedly dubious character, Zola stresses the well-mannered, private nature of the painter 's lifestyle : " Manet rentre dans son interieur et y goute les joies calmes de la bourgeoisie moderne. II frequente le monde assidument, il mene l'existence de chacun, avec cette difference qu'il est peut-etre encore plus paisible et mieux e1eve que chacun "( 12 : 827). By sequestering Manet and his work within the subdued bourgeois interior of his domicile, Zola endeavors to " save " art from the tumultuous laughter of those who rush into the Folies-Bergere in search of entertainment, only later to set foot in the salon to deride its " high " art. <p> Zola 's description contrasts with Ponge 's approach to Manet 's Bar aux Folies-Bergere in " Le Restaurant Lemeunier " in a number of ways : indeed, those aspects of the public perception of the artist that, in Zola 's text, are discarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its rightful place in the artistic canon are, in many cases, the very attributes celebrated in Ponge 's text. Zola paints a frightening picture of the " monstrous " crowd one encounters at the Folies-Bergere : " Epaules contre epaules, dos contre ventres, la foule ressemble a une hydre aux mille tetes "( 14:410). For him, the cafe-concert- " endroit bizarre, exquis, fort peu orthodoxe, moitie cafe, moitie theatre, parisien au possible, fort recherche par les provinciaux et les etrangers "( 14 : 408) -- threatens established social hierarchy. 18 In " Le Restaurant Lemeunier, " in contrast, Ponge takes obvious pleasure in underscoring the multiple discursive layers that fill the restaurant space. Like the Folies-Bergere, Lemeunier 's Restaurant is a place of what Clark has called " general social dishevelment "( 213), where diner and employee, sentiment and money, " high " art and caricature, sincerity and satire have a chance to mingle. <p> Toward the end of his campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his task as follows : " J'ai tache d'arracher l'artiste des mains de l'emeute et de le conduire en un lieu stir "( 12 : 845). The use of such a powerful term as " emeute " to define the unpredictable and sometimes violent reception of the painter 's work has a tendency to place Zola on the side of the cultural police whose job it is to control and, if need be, to silence the crowd in its eagerness to deride what claims to be high art. 19 In Zola 's grandiose view of Manet 's art, there is simply no room for the brutality of the crowd 's impious words. On the contrary, in Ponge 's poem, there is no " lieu stir " to protect art from the caprices of the public eye, no place capable of keeping the " emeute " of evolving languages from pervading his prose, from ridiculing poetry 's false dignity, its bevelled mirrors and gilded moldings. In the final analysis, Ponge 's engaging use of society 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely with an ideology that seeks to limit the role of the artist to what Clark has called that of " a complaisant spectator "( 205). <p> To be sure, Ponge was by no means the first prose poet to establish a kinship between himself and Manet. Baudelaire 's admiration of Manet is well documented and, although he died fifteen years before Un Bar aux FoliesBergere came into being, traces of the painter 's debt to the poet of Les Fleurs du Mal can no doubt be found in Manet 's depiction of the Parisian dance hall. By the same token, evidence of Manet 's influence in shaping Baudelaire 's poetry can be discerned in his work and, specifically, in his Petits poemes en prose. 20 At one point in that collection, Baudelaire evokes the image of a splendid painting that promises to deliver him and his " vieille amie " from " le desordre, la turbulence et l'imprdvu : " " Vivronsnous jamais, " Baudelaire asks, " passeronsnous jamais dans ce tableau qu'a peint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, it would appear, the people of Lemeunier 's Restaurant already reside in a painting : not one, however, that delivers them from disorder, turbulence, and the unforeseeable, but one that is itself chaotic. The " tapage " or din of Ponge 's text -- like that of the unreconciled tensions that inhabit Un Bar aux Folies-Bergere -- is nothing other than the artful inscription of " la vie moderne " in his prose poem. In " Le Restaurant Lemeunier, " prose poetry 's debt to Manet is rekindled and given a new, distinctly concrete dimension. Ponge may not have been the first in what Baudelaire once called in a letter to Manet the " decrepitude of his art "( Hamilton 35), and he was certainly not the last. <p> Middlebury College <p> The epigraph is taken from " Notes sur les Otages, peintures de Faulrier "( L'Atelier contemporain 17). Ponge 's Parti pris des choses and Proemes, both of which are quoted in the following article, can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Stout 's insightful study, " The Text as Object : Francis Ponge 's Verbal Still Lifes. " On several occasions in L'Atelier contemporain, Ponge emphasizes the enthusiasm with which artists greeted his 1942 prose poem collection, stating for example on the opening page that " mes amis Paulhan et Gallimard ayant porte au grand jour, en 1942, ce tres mince recueil, Le parti pris des choses, morceaux choisis de proses nees sur mes etablis durant la premiere moitie de mon, age, il en resulta que je me trouvai, peu apres, frequentant certains autres ateliers "( vii) or, in " Texte sur Picasso, " " Picasso avait lu assez attentivement mon petit livre Le Parti pris des ohosex, paru a Paris en 1942, pour desirer, m'avait-on dir, me connaitre "( 336), or, in " Braque, un meditatif a l'oeuvre, " " mon petit ouvrage, Le parti prix des choses, etait paru( en 1942) et comme, depuis le commencement de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d'en assurer le service a quelques personnes, selon son propre choix. Or, il l'avait notamment envoye a Picasso et a Braque ; un peu plus tard il m'avait ecrit : Braque me parle souvent de toi "( 296). Paulhan 's actual words in his correspondence with Ponge -- " Braque est emballe par le Parti-pris. "( Correspondance 280) -- suggest that Ponge 's prose poetry was instrumental in opening the door of Braque 's studio to the poet after the war. Jean-Yves Pouilloux 's characterization of Ponge 's " Notes sur les Otages "( 1946) as the poet 's " premiare marche d'approche "( 1065) to painting is in this sense an oversimplification. In the following, I will argue that Ponge 's interest in painting and his desire to articulate that interest in his writing precede his discovery of the work of Fautrier by many years. Botticelli 's Fall, which Ponge saw at the musee de Chantilly in 1925, led him to write a poem inspired by that painting( Correspondance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 221-222). which Ponge wished to study in preparation for his own Notes prises pour utl oiseau, written in 1938 and later published in La rage de l'expression( 1952), testify to Ponge 's early interest in painting as a source of inspiration for his work, even prior to the publication of Le Patti pris des choses in 1942. Although Ponge does not mention painting in his 1919 prose poem, the following passage underscores affinities between Ponge 's nascent material view of poetry and the visual arts : " O draperies des mots, assemblages de l'art litteraire, o massifs, o pluriels, parterres de voyelles colorees, decors des lignes, ombres de la muette, boucles superbes des consonnes, architectures, fioritures des points et des signes brefs, h mon secours!... O traces humaines h bout de bras, 6 sons originaux, monuments de l'enfance de l'art, quasi imperceptibles modifications physiques, CARACTERES, objets mysterieux perceptibles par deux sens seulement et cependant plus reel, plus sympathiques que des signes, -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de la qualite "( Tome premier 145-146). Ponge 's interest in language 's concreteness and its affinities with art has received considerable critical attention. In addition to John Stout 's aforementioned study, see, for example, Richard Stamelman 's " The Object in Poetry and Painting : Ponge and Picasso, " Serge Gavronsky 's " L '( Eil du regard : Ponge et l'art, " and Maria Warehime 's " Manifestoes and Still Life : Chardin and Ponge. " Throughout his writings on art, Ponge emphasizes the painter 's material link to the world. For example, in " Notes sur les Otages, " Ponge expresses a predilection for what he perceives to be the excremental qualities of Fautrier 's paintings( Atelier contemporain 37) ; in " Braque le reconciliateur, " he writes of the painter 's inclination to " prendre a la nature ses elements "( Atelier contemporain 64). For an interesting discussion of the materialistic dimension of Ponge 's project, see Jean-Claude Pinson 's study, " Le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's work have often dismissed those poems in Le Patti pris des choses that evoke scenes of Parisian life as dismal failures. In his essay on Ponge, which first appeared in Les Temps moderates in 1944, Sartre deals almost exclusively with the poet 's treatment of objects, categorically condemning those of Ponge 's prose poems that deal directly with groups of people : " les seuls mauvais -- mais tras mauvais -- ecrits de Ponge sont R. C. Seine No. et Le Restaurant Lemeunier, qu'il consacre aux collectivites humaines "( 267). Alain Bosquet, in 1966, reiterates the tendency to downplay if not efface altogether the social dimension of Ponge 's work : " les rapports entre homme et homme ne concerneront pas le poete : il choisira ailleurs son terrain. Le propre du poete n'est pas le commerce de ses semblables "( 99). Although Ian Higgins digs deeper into the problem by closely examining those prose poems where the social dimension predominates, the word he uses most frequently to characterize Ponge 's treatment of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Language, Politics and Things : The Weakness of Ponge 's Satire "). In ways that contrast with practices Ponge will later adopt in his writing, " Le Restaurant Lemeunier " clearly " illustrates " many identifiable traits of Manet 's painting, If, as Eliane Formentelli argues in the discussion of Ponge 's later writings on painting in " Ponge-peinture, " " le texte n'acceptera pas la sanction du tableau comme source ou comme modele producteur d'une representation verbale "( 187), this is evidently not the case in Ponge 's 1942 prose poem. Unlike later illustrations of Ponge 's work by painters including Herold, Fautrier, or Ayme, the relationship Manet 's Bar shares with " Le Restaurant Lemeunier " does not undermine the painting 's function as a work that " illustrates " Ponge 's poem. For an interesting study of how some of Ponge 's later works problematize such a function, see Renee Riese Hubert : " Ponge and Postmodern Illustration. " For an indepth study of Veronese 's painting, see Les @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed at the time Ponge 's text was written, distinguishes Veronese 's musician from the gentleman in the mirror of Manet 's Bar or the flaneur of Ponge 's poem, both of whom are perceived as different from the works ' authors. Although Ponge does not use the term " flaneur " to describe the person through whose eyes we see the restaurant, several aspects of his comportment recall his nineteenth-century predecessors, particularly his anonymity, his fascination for the crowd, and his detachment. For an interesting discussion of the dynamics of flanerie as they relate to the role of the artist in nineteenthcentury France, see Richard Sennett 's The Fall of Public Man. These shifts from subjective to anonymous observer recall the spectator 's predicament in viewing Manet 's Bar au Folies-Bergere, as is discussed later in this article. As Clark remarks in his reading of the painting, " we -- like the flaneur -- can not or will not take the place of the gentleman in the top hat, but there is no other place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion of Manet 's painting and its reception in the late nineteenth century, see the chapter entitled " A Bar at the Folies-Bergere " in Clark 's seminal work, The Painting of Modern Life. Zola continues, adopting a more emphatically ironic tone : " L'art est grave, il ennuie profondement ; il faut bien l'egayer un peu, chercher un toile dans le Salon qu'on puisse toumer en ridicule "( 12 : 842). Like children, the public must be taught to behave : " le public... regarde des oeuvres d'art, comme les enfants regardent des images : pour s'amuser, pour s'egayer un peu "( 12 : 842). By restoring seriousness to the reception of Manet 's work, Zola hoped to save it from caricature, laughter, and the refusal on the public 's part to act like adults. Zola professes, instead, an avowed preference for the uncompromised homogeneity of the working-class cabaret : " Que le peuple aille au cabaret.... C'est le meilleur de nous-memes, de notre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "( 14 : 201). For an interesting account of Zola 's critical view of urban leisure spaces including the Folies-Bergere, see Denis Hollier 's stimulating study, " Bloody Sundays. " By " lieu stir, " Zola means of course the Louvre, the place of honor of such paintings as Veronese 's Wedding Feast at Cana, evoked in Ponge 's prose poem, or da Vinci 's Joconde, now encased in glass in order to protect it from the crowds that gather in front of it to catch a glimpse of her elusive smile. But, despite his good intentions, Zola 's desire to " conduire Manet en un lieu stir " smacks of incarceration. It is an appeal to remove Manet from the concert-hall context in which Un Bar aux Folies-Bergere was produced in order to protect it once and for all from the vulgarity of its subject. In Les Petits poemes en prose, " La Corde " begins with a dedication to Manet. <p> PHOTO( BLACK &; WHITE) : Figure 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Todtri Productions, Ltd.) <p> PHOTO( BLACK &; WHITE) : Figure 2.
