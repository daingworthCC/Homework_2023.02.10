4159741 Original Article # Infusing Transition Planning and Instruction Into Elementary Classrooms # There is a widespread misconception that transition planning and programming begin in high school. However, there are many opportunities for teachers to infuse transition-focused education into teaching and learning activities for their elementary-grade students. Teachers can engage students with disabilities and their families in transition-focused activities throughout the elementary school years. Activities include helping students build self-determination and career awareness as well as increasing parental knowledge about the longitudinal nature of transition planning. # Transition planning has been required under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act( IDEA) since 1990, but individuals with disabilities have yet to achieve postschool outcomes that are on par with their peers without disabilities. In the most recent report of postschool outcomes from the National Longitudinal Transition Study-2, youth with disabilities were found to be less likely than their peers in the general population to enroll in and complete postsecondary education, gain employment, and live independently in the years following high school completion( Newman et al., 2011). To increase the likelihood that students with disabilities achieve successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that students have adequate time to prepare for this transition. IDEA( 2004) states that transition planning must begin by age 16 " or younger if determined appropriate by the IEP individualized education program Team "( 20 U.S.C. 1414 d1AiVIII). Recognizing the importance of appropriate student-focused experiences to prepare for the transition process, several states have chosen to formally begin the process at age 14 or before. # Since the inception of the transition requirements in IDEA, professionals have recommended a longitudinal approach to transition planning, beginning in the primary grades( see Clark, Carlson, Fisher, Cook, &amp; D'Alonzo, 1991 ; Moore, Agran, &amp; McSweyn, 1990) and using backward planning to build educational experiences toward transition goals( Baer, 2008). However, coordinated teaching and learning activities explicitly aimed at transition-focused education have not been systematically integrated into elementary school curricula. Yet, findings suggest that more successful postschool outcomes can result from the implementation of several important activities that can readily be integrated into elementary schools, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awareness, and family involvement( Test et al., 2009 ; Wehmeyer &amp; Palmer, 2003). Developing self-determination and career awareness is a lifelong process that should begin in the primary grades. # Building relationships with families and educating them about the transition planning process that will take place in the later grades are both important aspects of the elementary special education teacher 's role. There are specific strategies that elementary school teachers can use to increase opportunities for children to develop critical self-determination skills, provide career awareness experiences, and extend these learning opportunities to the home through family involvement. # Self-Determination # Self-determination is a research-based theory with over 25 years of data to support beneficial implications in special education settings by increasing postsecondary outcomes and future success in education and employment( Wehmeyer &amp; Field, 2007). According to Wehmeyer and Shogren( 2013), individuals who are self-determined have better knowledge of their own interests, strengths, and needs, and they carry out their own desires. Self-determined individuals make decisions, set goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals are accomplished. Because many students lack the aforementioned skills, direct teaching and acquisition of skill development has been shown to increase self-determined behavior( e.g., Wehmeyer, Palmer, Shogren, Williams-Diehm, &amp; Soukup, 2013). # Promoting Self-Determination at the Elementary Level # Self-determination develops across all ages, and school- and family-based activities help to increase levels of self-determination( Palmer, 2010). Realizing self-determination is a lifelong process helps to promote the need at the early level( Wehmeyer &amp; Palmer, 2000). The literature base that addresses the promotion of self-determination at early levels most often includes suggestions for parents and families( Erwin, Brotherson, Palmer, Cook, &amp; Summers, 2009) or possible ways to create environments to lead toward opportunities to practice self-determined behavior( Brotherson, Cook, Erwin, &amp; Weigel, 2008). Consideration of family and cultural background can be critical when infusing elements of self-determination at the elementary level. It may be more important to include families in the development of self-determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to greatly promote skills, such as choice making and decision making, in home environments( Brotherson et al., 2008). With the increased attention to Common Core State Standards( CCSS), student involvement continues to be a concern at all levels( Appleton, Christenson, Kim, &amp; Reschly, 2006). Self-determination can be readily infused into existing general education curricula that are aligned with the CCSS and can help to build a foundation for future in-school and postschool success( Rowe, Mazzotti, &amp; Sinclair, 2015). # Incorporating Self-Determination Activities in the Elementary Curriculum # One factor in promoting the development of self-determination for all children, and especially for younger children, is opportunity. Self-determined behavior must be practiced in controlled situations if children are to succeed in other environments. Table 1 depicts nine strategies that incorporate self-determination concepts into elementary curricula. These strategies were developed based on the essential elements of self-determination( Wehmeyer, 2003) and the five guiding principles proposed by Brotherson et al.( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn and apply self-determined behaviors early in their school careers and for these strategies to be utilized across home and community environments. # Career Awareness and Development # Teaching and learning activities directed at promoting career awareness and development also advance self-determination by increasing children 's self-awareness. Embedding learning experiences aimed at career awareness and development during the elementary grades reflects a necessary component of a longitudinal approach to transition-focused education. Many theories of career development and career choice have been advanced and provide a strong research base for practice. These frameworks typically describe three stages : career awareness, career exploration, and career experiences, with awareness and exploration activities beginning in the elementary years and opportunities for exploration and work experiences increasing with age. # Both inclusion in the general education curriculum in classes with peers without disabilities and career awareness have been found to be evidence-based predictors of successful transition outcomes( Test et al., 2009). Table 2 provides a description of resources for teachers of elementary school students to facilitate career awareness and exploration within the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn about careers, their interests, and careers or occupations that best align with their interests and strengths. # Learning From Role Models # Snowden( 2003) described the importance of using role models to promote career awareness in youth with disabilities. Children need to observe and learn from individuals with disabilities who are working and have been successful in employment and careers. Several of the descriptions provided in Table 2 engage employees from businesses to provide authentic career awareness experiences. Having employed individuals with disabilities visit the classroom or having them interact with children through participation in career fairs or class excursions to community businesses and other workplaces provides an opportunity for children to witness firsthand people with disabilities working. # In the event that teachers are not able to identify employees with disabilities in local businesses, it is important to incorporate either real or fictitious examples of individuals with disabilities across the curricula to aid in the exploration of various jobs and careers. Seeing or hearing about individuals with disabilities who are characters in stories or other media--such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Picture Book of Thomas Alva Edison : Great Inventor( Adler, 1996) ; and Our Teacher 's in a Wheelchair( Powers, 1987) --helps students with and without disabilities learn about the knowledge and skills of individuals with disabilities. # The real or fictitious role models should speak about various occupations ranging from entry-level and advanced positions and occupations not requiring a college degree to those requiring additional education or training beyond a high school diploma. It is important for children to learn about the diversity of jobs that people with disabilities perform. Engaging in teacher- or role model--directed discussions about challenges presented by the employee 's or character 's disability and strategies for overcoming those challenges provides for a valuable learning experience and helps to foster beliefs about the benefits and importance of work and careers as well as reinforces several key self-determination skills. For example, children with disabilities learn there are jobs and careers for all individuals. Role models also help raise expectations and aspirations as they share information about the types of jobs and careers achieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local chamber of commerce or human resource departments of local businesses and community agencies that provide employment services to individuals with disabilities, such as the office of vocational rehabilitation services, the developmental disability or mental health office, and supported employment providers. Business Leadership Networks( BLN ; http : //www.usbln.org/) is also a valuable resource to assist in identifying workers with disabilities, although it does not have a presence in all states. # The Internet also presents opportunities to identify and share information about employees with disabilities working across different industries. The DO-IT program at the University of Washington( visit http : **39;47491;TOOLONG... provides examples of people with disabilities working and how computer technology addresses limitations experienced due to one 's disabilities, so individuals are able to be productive employees. # Community-Based Instruction # Several teaching and learning experiences aimed at career awareness can be enhanced through visits with employers and access to businesses in the community( Beale, 2000). Offices, farms, hospitals, restaurants, theaters, manufacturing facilities, wholesale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and authentic learning experiences for children. Visits to the variety of businesses within the community provide opportunities for children to learn about the types of jobs and careers that exist in their locality. Teachers can discuss different industry clusters, and students can compare and contrast industries by gathering data related to industry outlook, salary or wages and employment, workplace demographics, and career ladders through implementation of several strategies listed in Table 3. # Children in elementary school are not expected to make decisions about a specific career. Instead, they need to learn about a variety of career choices and how their skills and interests will affect their career choices( i.e., self-awareness). Student participation in community experiences where they apply academic, social, or general work behaviors and skills is an evidence-based predictor of postschool success( Test et al., 2009). Table 3 includes activities related to Career Days and career interviews, which can be used to prepare students for trips to visit businesses or as follow-up activities after the students visit. # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-determination, such as self-awareness and choice making, these career awareness activities should contribute to practices at the elementary level aimed at advancing transition-focused education for youth with disabilities. The involvement of families in these and other activities is essential to ensure effective transition planning from an early age. # Family Involvement # In transition planning, families provide important information on the strengths and needs of their children and can offer perspectives on postschool outcomes that fit within the values of their family and culture( Landmark, Zhang, &amp; Montoya, 2007). Further, families provide a " bridge " from school to postschool life, as their support does not end upon high school graduation. Parental involvement, as defined by active and knowledgeable participation in all aspects of transition planning, has been found to be an evidence-based predictor of postschool employment success( Test et al., 2009). # Yet, family involvement in transition planning does not begin just when the student turns 14 or 16. Engaging in the transition process early provides the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning and the importance of their role. Elementary school teachers can support the preparation of families to be effective members of the transition-planning team. In IEP meetings beginning in elementary school, special education teachers can explain the transition-planning process. Information can be provided about the start date for formal transition planning and the steps that will be taken to plan and prepare students for life after high school. For students who will require more intensive supports, teachers can connect families with the resources that are available in the local community to assist with transition and postschool life. The Parent Transition Information Needs Survey( Wandry &amp; Pleet, 2009) provides a useful tool for determining parent needs for information. This survey asks parents to rate their level of need for information regarding a number of aspects of the transition process, such as graduation requirements, age-of-majority guidelines, and various supports and services that may be available to students after high school. Schools may also want to put in place a process for determining when the student and family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required legal age. # It is also important that families be motivated to be active participants in the transition-planning process. The relationships that families build with school professionals from early on are critical in determining their willingness to take on a collaborative role in transition planning( deFur, Todd-Allen, &amp; Getzel, 2001). Special education teachers in elementary and middle schools can lay the groundwork for later family involvement through the development and maintenance of relationships in which families feel heard and take on a valued role in their children 's education. DeFur( 2009) described a model for partnering with families in the transition-planning process that includes 10 strategies :( a) stay student and family centered,( b) develop a shared vision for transition outcomes,( c) be culturally responsive,( d) communicate proactively,( e) be caring and committed,( f) give choice and voice to all parties,( g) problem solve creatively,( h) offer helpful connections for students and families,( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) reflect on and celebrate accomplishments. Using these strategies to partner with families during the elementary grades could help to ensure that positive relationships have developed by the time formal transition planning begins. # Beyond family involvement, parent expectations for postsecondary education and employment have been found to be an evidence-based predictor of postschool outcomes( see Mazzotti, Rowe, Poppen, and Sinclair, 2014). In addition, the expectations that families hold as early as kindergarten have been found to be positively related to their child 's later academic achievement( Froiland, Peterson, &amp; Davison, 2012). The implication of these findings is that special education teachers in the elementary grades can work to convey to parents the importance of holding high expectations for their children 's future success. Individuals with disabilities are achieving far more than many were ever expected to : holding jobs, accessing postsecondary education, and living independently. Teachers can share stories of students who went on to have successful, independent, and fulfilling lives and should ensure that nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have for their children. Teachers may also need to recognize the beliefs and assumptions that they hold regarding parent involvement to ensure that they do not disempower parents from taking an active role( Landmark, Roberts, &amp; Zhang, 2013). Educators may also require training on the potential of students with disabilities so that they do not inadvertently limit parent expectations for their child 's postschool success( Martinez, Conroy, &amp; Cerreto, 2012). # Conclusion # The strategies presented in this article provide suggestions for teachers to begin infusing transition-focused education into elementary classrooms. Although teachers recognize the importance of beginning transition planning early( Wandry et al., 2008), many feel a lack of knowledge and skills for engaging in this essential task( Landmark et al., 2013). Formal transition course work and ongoing professional development can ensure that teachers feel confident in their abilities to engage in transition-planning practices across grade levels( Morningstar &amp; Benitez, 2013) # Table 1.
