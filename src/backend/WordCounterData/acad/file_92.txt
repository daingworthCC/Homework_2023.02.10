4013541 Muslim merchants from West Africa expand their markets to New York City. <p> Born in Niger, Issifi Mayaki learned his father 's trade : selling indigenous African cloth, including antique textiles. With his impeccable French, he developed a clientele among French expatriates in the city of Abidjan, Cte d'Ivoire, and after picking up English he successfully cultivated members of Abidjan 's English-speaking diplomatic community as well as African American visitors. Then in 1992, at the age of thirty, Mayaki began eyeing the lucrative market in the United States. Deciding to take a gamble, he packed up and airfreighted much of his stock to New York City, bought a round-trip ticket( as required for a six-month business visitor 's visa), and set out to make his fortune. <p> At first, things went well. Upon arriving, Mayaki found lodging with fellow traders at a run-down, ostensibly single-room-occupancy hotel on West 77th Street in Manhattan and started making contacts. But several weeks later, after he sent out a large shipment of Ghanaian kente cloth, the recipient refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Much of the inventory of valuable fabrics that had taken him years to collect in Africa was thus lost in a matter of weeks. In fact, he was stranded : to meet expenses, he had already sold the return portion of his air ticket. <p> Mayaki turned to his compatriots for assistance, and they pooled money to provide him with a loan. Adapting quickly to new circumstances, he decided to stock up on rap, rhythm and blues, and jazz cassettes to market to African Americans in Harlem. He set up a table on West 125th Street near the famed Apollo Theater and eventually took up residence with another trader living nearby. After city authorities cleared out the 125th Street market area, Mayaki relocated to the Malcolm Shabazz Harlem Market on West 116th Street, where he rented a stall for seven dollars a day and began to sell textiles along with cassettes and a few CDs. In time, he again became a cloth merchant. <p> " Was it difficult to negotiate the crossroads of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Life in New York is filled with uncertainties, " he answered. " If I fall sick, will I be able to get help? Will Immigration detain and deport me? Will I make enough money to send to my family in Niger and Cte d'Ivoire? Will I make enough to pay my bills? So far, God has blessed me. The only certainty is that I have always been a trader and will always be a trader. " <p> Two integrated aspects of his cultural heritage have enabled Mayaki to walk the myriad economic and social paths of New York City : the practices of West African trade and the teachings of Islam. Throughout the history of West Africa, specialized traders have, through kinship or patron-client relations, established large corporate networks. The most notable of these professional traders belong to two ethnic groups, the Hausa( Mayaki 's group) and the Malinke, sometimes referred to as the Dyula. Other major players are Songhay from Niger and Mali, Wolof from Senegal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West African traders in New York City have well-established procedures and organizations for obtaining informal credit and raising capital, and they adhere to Islamic precepts concerning commercial transactions. <p> From the earliest years of the ummah( the Muslim community of believers), which was established by the prophet Muhammad in the early seventh century A.D., traders were urged to interact in cooperative ways that would increase commerce. Various passages in the Qur'an speak of manifesting goodwill, providing correct weight, and not giving false oaths in transactions. More emphatically, Muhammad opposed monopolistic practices that could undermine cooperative relations. So when Mayaki( who regularly studies the Qur'an and the Hadith, or record of the Prophet 's sayings) speaks of hard work, honest commercial relations, and trust, these beliefs derive directly from Islam. <p> Boub Mounkaila is a Songhay, not a Hausa, but like Mayaki, he came to New York City from Niger by way of Abidjan. At the Malcolm Shabazz Harlem Market, he sells wristwatches as well as leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopt the styles and trademarks of DKNY, Gucci, Rolex, and Swiss Army brands, but he makes no secret of the fact that his are counterfeits. <p> " I must be honest in my dealings, " he told me. " I let everyone know that what I sell are copies, not originals. " <p> " They probably know anyway, from the price " I said. " I mean, it 's hard to get a real Rolex for twenty-five dollars. " <p> " It does n't matter, " replied Mounkaila. " I must tell them anyway. That is our way. I am a merchant, and I try to establish trust with my clients. That way, they will, Inshallah -- God willing -- come back. " He connected his trading practices to Islam. " I try to be a good Muslim. I say my prayers five times a day, avoid alcohol and pork, and give to the unfortunate, I try to be honest in trade. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better trader " <p> While the founding of Islam triggered the expansion of trade from Arabia to North and West Africa, the extension of kinship ties -- both fictive and real -- provided a customary means of enlarging trade networks. The practices that made long-distance trade possible in West Africa hold today in New York City. Mayaki 's network consists, first of all, of his paternal kin. He is obliged to send money to the family head( his father) and to look after his mother and brothers. But Mayaki also feels a social and economic loyalty to his " brother " traders. His most important transactions and dealings are with fellow Hausa from Niger whom he knows from Abidjan. To lesser degrees, his sense of trust and comfort extends to other Hausa traders and then to other West African traders. He can expect to give and receive a small amount of credit from any of these people, no matter their actual proximity to his informal personal trade network, which also includes Korean, Chinese, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, resilient, and disciplined, " Mayaki says. " It encourages our creativity in new lands. It creates a climate of trust. " <p> There are even several economic networks of Hausa and Songhay traders that sponsor " trade children " in New York City. In West Africa, established elder traders, or " fathers " pay airfare, procure visas, and provide investment capital for enterprising young men. In return, they receive a percentage of the profits that their " children " earn. One of these elder traders is El Hadj Soumana Tondi, who travels from West Africa to New York City every six weeks to, as he puts it, check up on his children at the Shabazz Market. <p> Tens of thousands of West Africans, most of them men, have poured into the United States during the past fifteen years, usually settling in New York City or elsewhere on the East Coast. They are part of the wave of " new immigrants " consisting of people from developing countries affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Those who are literate and have work permits may drive yellow cabs or use their profits from vending to open a restaurant, boutique, or import-export business. But the majority enter a legal limbo, overstaying their visas. They become a vital part of the ever-growing informal sector, or underground economy, which evades the reach of government regulation and therefore goes untaxed. <p> Lower-income neighborhoods in New York City are major arenas of such economic activity. Like Ralph Ellison 's " invisible man " many new immigrants walk in the shadows, their life stories and cultural backgrounds virtually unknown to the mainstream citizenry. Typical underground workers include the Trinidadian day-care employee for whom no Social Security forms are completed ; the Guinean " gypsy cab " driver, possibly unlicensed or underinsured, who cruises parts of the city neglected by the yellow taxis ; the Peruvian carpenter who crafts furniture in a space not zoned for manufacturing ; the Thai woman who sews teddy bears in a poorly lit suburban garage ; and, of course, the unlicensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooklyn or Lower Manhattan with African Americans, Jamaicans, Vietnamese, Ecuadorians, and a host of others. <p> Although he has become a pragmatic player in the global economy, Issifi Mayaki maintains a judicious distance from a society whose values he finds both fascinating and disturbing. As it is, during his time in New York City, he has been torn by conflicting allegiances -- to his wife and children ; to Monique, the girlfriend he has acquired, and her child ; to his mother, father, and brothers ; and to his own desires. One warm January day, I went to the Shabazz Market to see Mayaki, and we got into a discussion about his family, whom he had not seen in five years. " I miss Africa so much that I 've become a nasty person, giving everybody a hard time, " he lamented. " I really want to go back and see my family. " <p> Mayaki 's wife, children, and mother live near Maradi, Niger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sahel. His father and three of his brothers are merchants who live in Abidjan. At the time of our conversation, a fourth brother, who had trained as a schoolteacher in Niger, was living in Melbourne, Australia, where he worked in a boutique specializing in African art. <p> Talk of his family compelled Mayaki to think of his mother. " For me, " he said, " there is no more important person than my mother. You know how it is between sons and mothers. I really miss my mother. But when I tell this to Monique, she thinks that I really miss my wife. I care very much for Monique, and I respect my wife, but my mother is more important. We are of the same blood. " <p> Mayaki reiterated that Americans could n't understand why family is so important to Africans. " You understand, " he said to me, " because you lived there for seven years. But Monique? " He shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went on. " One of my brothers will come here. After I train him, I 'll go back to Abidjan and he 'll stay here. " <p> For some reason, the unusual warmth that day had n't drawn many customers to the market. Passing merchants offered their greetings to us. A young African American woman asked if Mayaki had Dutch Wax cloth. He searched through the bolts and found some. The woman did n't like the color scheme and sauntered away. Mayaki turned back to me, and we continued our conversation. <p> " There are two important things in my life : family and things that stir my heart. I sell my products to any person, Christian or Muslim, pastors or drug dealers, for if I am honest, money has no smell. If God grants me money in exchange for hard work, I must first make sure that my family is okay, that they 're well fed, well clothed, well housed, and in good health. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that stir my heart. " Mayaki pointed to his black leather jacket and said he had bought it at the Gap. He touched his corduroy trousers. " The Gap. I bought three pair. " He unzipped his jacket to reveal a rust-colored linen shirt. " The Gap also, " he said, smiling. <p> Mayaki was able to make these purchases because of a successful winter holiday season -- a season that in much of the United States now includes Kwanzaa, a recently established African American community and cultural celebration spanning December 26 through January 1. Mayaki had rented space at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, the site of New York City 's annual Kwanzaa Fest, and had sold a great deal of cloth to African Americans who wished to honor African values and to buy African products. <p> In the current climate, marked by suspicion and vilification of all things Muslim, Mayaki and his brother traders present a positive and dynamic portrait of how Islam bolsters the growth of trade and social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Africans have established new partnerships, mastering the culture of capitalism while reinforcing traditions of long-distance African trading. They have staked out individual space in a market culture while engaging in the cooperative economics dictated by Islam and by long-standing West African commercial practices. They have adapted to the unfamiliar stresses of big-city life in the United States while reaffirming their African identities. Traders like Mayaki have much to teach us about how urban society works in contemporary America. <p> From April through October, some West Africans pack vans with African leather goods, textiles, and jewelry, along with Chinese- or Korean-made baseball caps and T-shirts that display logos of U.S. sports teams. Thus equipped, they tour through what they call " the bush " -- Indianapolis, Kansas City, Detroit -- following the circuit of African American trade shows and Third World cultural fairs. With his newly purchased van, Issifi Mayaki has recently become one of these mobile merchants. Although he travels the side roads of America, he is by no means isolated, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected to business associates, friends, and family in the United States and Africa. And if, by chance, his successful travels in the American bush transport him to the Gap, he might well follow his heart to browse and perhaps buy. <p> PHOTOS( COLOR) : Senegalese markets such as the one above are part of the multinational West African trade network.
