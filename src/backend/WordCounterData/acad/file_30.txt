4003941 INTRODUCTION <p> This study is intended to establish a framework for analyzing the economic impact of narcotraffic between Colombia, where most of the world 's cocaine is refined, and the State of Florida, which is the primary area of entry for Andean cocaine into the United States. 1 The purpose of the study is to analyze the economic costs and benefits of this activity to Florida, as an example that could be extended in both directions -- to Colombia and to the entire United States -- if additional data were to become available. Only the trade in cocaine is examined, though additional traffic in marijuana does take place and, in some cases, the data are not disaggregated for each drug. Only the economic impact is studied, though the trade obviously impacts the social and political realms as well. Because the tools of analysis are quite different among the disciplines, and because the economic issues need to be sorted out in any discussion of the overall impact of the cocaine trade, only economic issues are treated here. <p> While trade in illegal drugs in Florida encompasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade extends far beyond Colombia and Florida( Bagley, 1988 ; Lee, 1985-86), 2 the present study is limited to Colombia-Florida cocaine trafficking, distribution and consumption in Florida, and the financial flows involved. The conceptual framework illuminates the key factors involved in measuring costs and benefits to the state of Florida of the range of activities that constitute this drug trade. The key difference between Florida and other states, despite the fact that cocaine trafficking and consumption are national, not local, phenomena, is that cocaine typically enters the US market through Florida, and the flow of funds related to the wholesale trade often pass through Miami. This is in addition to the retail traffic that is similar across states in terms of the kinds of economic impacts involved. <p> The most common issues treated in impact studies of this type are the law enforcement costs and the drug treatment and rehabilitation costs due to illegal trafficking and drug consumption. Both of these are direct costs. In addition, the implicit social costs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug abuse are usually estimated. The present project includes these issues and raises several additional concerns that apply especially to Florida. <p> Among the issues that are peculiar to the State of Florida is the process of international money laundering of cocaine-related income. During most of the 1980s, this phenomenon was centered in Miami, though in the past two or three years an increase in law-enforcement efforts have pushed money-launderers to seek additional points of entry into the United States, including other Florida cities such as Tampa and Orlando( NNICC, 1989 : 91-99). Money laundering can take place through many financial instruments and institutions, so the issue is much more complex than simply the process of depositing narcodollars in cash in Florida banks. Our interest is in the impact of this activity on Florida, but we need to trace it through the mechanisms used in order to understand the full significance. <p> Another issue that is clearly different in Florida from the narco-traffic picture in most of the rest of the United States is the investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. This investment has taken the form of purchases of condominiums, apartments, and homes in( principally South) Florida, as well as acquisitions of companies, commercial real estate, and financial instruments in the area. Although it is not straightforward to estimate the amount of such investment in Florida, casual empiricism indicates that the quantity is quite large, and that it is concentrated in the Latin part of the state, mainly in Dade County. 3 As with the money laundering, these investments often are carried out through unusual vehicles, such as offshore trusts and non-resident companies. Investigation on this issue includes an effort to model the investment patterns and then to measure the value of such investments. Note that investments by local cocaine traffickers are not expected to differ across states, but that investment by the Colombian suppliers of the drug is known to concentrate in Florida. <p> A third issue that is specific to Florida is the consumption of goods and services by Colombian and Florida narcotraffickers, who use more of their funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, they consume as well as invest in the local market. Consumption items include all goods and services, other than real estate and financial instruments, that may be purchased with available funds. Part of the effort here is to construct a plausible model of expected consumption by narcotraffickers. Then it will be possible to extrapolate the spending of this type, based on our initial estimates of the income produced. <p> An assessment of the economic impact of these activities, however accurately or inaccurately measured, requires comparison with alternative situations that could plausibly exist in the absence of the cocaine-related phenomena under study. Specifically, it is necessary to compare the costs of drug abuse now with what would occur in the absence of cocaine( i.e., assuming successful TOTAL INTERDICTION of the drug). This comparison would permit a discussion of the results of eliminating cocaine from consumption, which is the logical goal of the interdiction efforts. Also, it is useful to examine the alternative of LEGALIZING cocaine use in the United States, so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with the current costs and benefits of partial interdiction and continued illegal consumption. Each of these comparisons requires evidence from other contexts( such as prohibition of the sale of alcoholic beverages and the subsequent abolishing of prohibition in the United States earlier in this century), since neither total interdiction nor legalization has been achieved. <p> The paper is divided into five major sections. First, the issue of crime protection/law enforcement is treated, presenting measures of the costs involved. In this section the costs of( i.e., damages due to) criminal activities also are discussed. Second, the medical and rehabilitative costs are reviewed. Third, the question of lost employee production is raised and estimates suggested. These three sections use widely-available data and do not present any new evidence. The fourth section focuses on the financial flows involved in the narcotraffic, which lead to added investment and consumption in the Florida economy, as well as some added costs. This section presents a variety of methods for measuring the likely size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present. All of the estimates refer to the year 1988, unless otherwise noted. The fifth and final section compares these results with hypothesized outcomes under a situation of total interdiction of the cocaine trade and also under a situation of legalized cocaine trafficking. CRIME PROTECTION/LAW ENFORCEMENT <p> Protection against the crimes associated with drug trafficking is the largest direct cost found in this study. The crimes include such activities as : physically shipping cocaine into the United States from abroad ; transferring payments for the drugs into US financial institutions and other investments ; and robbery committed by cocaine addicts seeking money to buy more drugs. These activities alone suggest some of the key areas for protection expenditure : i.e., government provision of ships, airplanes and people to interdict cocaine shipments ; the use of Operations Greenback, PolarCAP, C-Chase, and others to intervene in money laundering schemes ; operation of the legal system to prosecute violators ; and both police protection and personal security provision to deal with cocaine-related robberies. <p> Estimates of many of the costs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem in 1984. They can be ascribed proportionally to Florida based on the size of the state 's economy, to provide an initial crude estimate of the size of the problem. The estimates are as follows( Harwood et. al, 1984 : 4) : See Table I below. <p> Without attempting to evaluate the accuracy of these data, it may simply be noted that the approximate crime protection cost related to cocaine trafficking in Florida was over $300 million in 1988. From the perspective of the state of Florida, the Federal portion of enforcement expenditures is " subsidized by taxpayers in other states of the union since the Federal funds to pay for the programs are raised nationally. However, the Federal law enforcement expenditures related to cocaine interdiction actually are higher in Florida than in other states, so the estimate of these expenditures in the table is biased downward. More careful disaggregation of this information clearly is needed. <p> These numbers can be corroborated with direct measures of crime protection costs as compiled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enforcement has estimated a variety of costs incurred by state agency activities related to narcotics. The estimates cover a range of state and local government expenditures on crime protection programs, but not the Federal programs or private-sector expenses. These costs are listed in Table 2 for 1988( FDLE, 1989). <p> An unavoidable problem with these estimates is that they cover costs of protection against crimes due to all forms of drug abuse, not just cocaine abuse. In fact, if we keep to the task of evaluating the costs and benefits of the cocaine traffic, these estimates will have to be lowered to exclude problems related to other drugs. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement specifically estimates that cocaine and marijuana account for about 45% of total crime cases investigated in the state. Of that 45%( which is the basis of the estimates in the table above), the vast majority of cases( about 80%) relate to cocaine. This would give a final crime protection cost of $428 million x.80 -- $342 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the State of Florida costs of crime protection, we need to include the costs incurred by Federal agencies operating to control cocaine-related crime in Florida. The agencies involved include : Justice Department Drug Enforcement Agency( DEA) and US Attorney 's Office ; Treasury Department Internal Revenue Service money-laundering unit ; US Customs Service ; US Coast Guard, and other agencies to a lesser degree. Estimates of the costs of operating these agencies in Florida and on Florida-related activities are shown in Table 3. <p> An additional area of crime protection expense created by cocaine trafficking and consumption is personal protection obtained by households in the form of fences, burglar alarms, watchdogs, guards, etc. These costs have not been estimated in Florida, as far as we have been able to discover. Therefore, the national estimates that were interpolated for Florida are used again here : $91 million for 1988. <p> The estimates are : $342 million for state and local law enforcement ; $87 million for Federal enforcement efforts ; and $91 million for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $520 million in 1988 appears to be a reasonable estimate of the total crime protection cost in Florida associated with cocaine-related crime protection. MEDICAL EXPENSES <p> Medical expenses related to the cocaine traffic are estimated mainly as the costs of rehabilitation programs provided by Federal and state authorities, as well as by private sources. Additionally, we would like to include the medical costs of those people injured in drug-related crimes, but measures of these costs were not available. <p> In the State of Florida, the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services( HRS) is responsible for managing and licensing all drug abuse services. HRS contracts with 86 community-based drug abuse programs throughout the state to provide comprehensive education, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation services. Additional educational efforts to reduce drug abuse are carried out by the Florida Department of Education in a variety of programs. <p> The medical expenses that were measured include : See Table 4 below. <p> As before, these are annual costs for programs and services in the State of Florida in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only, the total annual cost for 1988 is $138 million. LOST PRODUCTION <p> This final issue on the cost side is the most difficult to measure. Obviously, an employee who is unable to work due to cocaine addiction or because the person participates in the illegal drug trade causes a loss of measured output for the economy. This simply assumes that that person would have been gainfully employed in the absence of the cocaine addition or business. However, the amount of work time lost to cocaine addiction is not possible to measure as accurately as the direct costs discussed above, since the level of addiction is not known, nor is the time lost from work readily attributable to cocaine abuse or other causes. Similarly, the narcotraffic participant may have otherwise worked in a productive job, or that person might have sought some other illegal employment or been unemployed. In all, the measures of lost work time must be fairly crude estimates of orders of magnitude. <p> After placing the above warnings about reliability of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to the national survey used in the previous estimates which, in turn, are restated as the Florida portion of the totals, lost production is by far the largest cost category of the drug trade. The 1988 estimates for Florida are as follows : See Table 5 below. <p> State estimates by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement are very similar, showing about $5 billion of lost production in 1987 due to substance abuse in the state( FDLE, 1988 : 2). Finally, recent( 1989) statements by the Federal drug policy coordinator, William Bennett, assert that in 1988 approximately $100 billion of productive output was lost due to narcotics consumption in the United States. This figure would impute to Florida, on the basis of population, about $4.7 billion of lost production in 1988. Once again, adjusting the data to account for cocaine-related costs alone, the annual value of lost production for 1988 is $3.8 billion. <p> These numbers dwarf those for the other cost categories, so that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnitude is truly astounding. 13 The negative economic impact of cocaine traffic is clearly very significant in the three categories examined here. FUNDS INFLOW AND CONSEQUENT INVESTMENT AND CONSUMPTION <p> This final category of factors contributing to the total economic impact of cocaine traffic on the State of Florida is undoubtedly the most widely-discussed. It necessarily is also the least measurable since the money flows are often illegal and just as often disguised through various schemes to hide the ownership and source of the funds( Walter, 1989). <p> The transfer of funds is itself of relatively little interest when our concern is with economic impact. The direct result of even billions of dollars of new deposits in the banking system is minimal in terms of employment, spending, and other economic aggregates.( For example, it has been estimated that at least $10 billion have moved from Panama to Miami banks since the indictment of General Noriega in 1988. The net number of new jobs in the Miami banking sector appears to be on the order of 10 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offshore in the Euromarkets, little spending impact occurs in Florida.) 14 As a result, our interest needs to focus on the uses of these funds, in investments and consumption of goods and services. <p> Before moving on to measure the uses of funds, it is necessary to establish some indication of the size of the flow of funds. These financial transfers may take a myriad of forms. Initial payments from US wholesalers of cocaine to Colombian exporters may be made completely within the United States, into accounts owned directly or indirectly by the exporters but, nonetheless, not crossing national borders and possibly not triggering government investigation into the source of the funds. Also, payments may be made in Colombia to the exporters and other participants in the early stages of drug production ; these people are likely to try to transfer the funds to a US location. This is the kind of situation in which " money laundering " is carried out, and which the US Treasury is combating specifically through operations of its money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocaine shipments, there are many downstream flows of money that result from the exporters ' use of their income to purchase US assets, products, and services. Purchase o luxury condominiums on Brickell Avenue in Miami or on Key Biscayne offer only the most visible use of these funds. Other uses range from the purchase of expensive cars, elaborate electronic security systems, and fast boats to the more mundane buying of household goods and airplane tickets. Figure 1( below) sketches the kinds of money flows that arise from the narcotraffic between Colombia and Florida. <p> Note that extensive financial transactions are generated in both directions between the two countries. The resulting net balance of payments is highly likely to be positive for Colombia and negative for the United States. This is because the initial export of cocaine leads to income for Colombians, who subsequently spend only a portion of that on purchases from the United States, leaving some of the funds in Colombia. Since most of the funds will eventually be placed in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect on the overall balance of payments is probably minor. However, most of the merchandise exports are from Colombia to the United States, and most of the investments in dollar-denominated financial assets are owned by Colombians( i.e., capital exports by the United States). <p> In addition to the international flows involved, the total payments in Florida include sales by wholesalers to retail cocaine dealers in Florida and sales to final customers. While this part of the total income generated by cocaine traffic is not international, it unquestionably constitutes part of the income generated in Florida. Thus, after calculating the impact of income earned by Colombian cartels from their export sales, we will examine the income produced within the State of Florida by the downstream trafficking. Measuring Initial Funds Flows <p> The problem of measuring the initial funds flow to cocaine exporters is the critical difficulty in making some meaningful statement about the net benefit to Florida of the financial part of the narcotraffic. At this point in the study, our only reasonable statement about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been working on the problem for several years. The Drug Enforcement Administration estimates that in 1987, in Florida, about $6 billion of illegal drug-related funds were paid to exporters and intermediaries( El Nuevo Herald, 1988). This estimate may or may not be accurate, but it must overstate part of the initial cocaine-export income since it includes marijuana as well as cocaine. If our intent is to measure first the initial income in the industry, then to see how the income is used, we must look for a better indicator of that initial flow. <p> One method for accomplishing this task would be to estimate foreign-owned deposits in Florida banks that come from Colombian depositors and then to estimate some percentage that could be judged to be cocaine-related. Although there are many difficulties with such a measure, it would offer one indirect indicator of the order of magnitude of the initial funds flow from Colombia. The greatest practical problem in creating the estimate is that Florida banks are not required to make available to the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any other classification that would be useful here. It is possible to obtain for the foreign bank agencies in Florida, and for the Edge Act corporations in Florida, a direct measure of their non-resident deposits, subdivided into interbank deposits and deposits held by commercial and individual clients, but not by country of origin. For domestic, full-service banks in Florida, this disaggregation of accounts is not available. Based on the value of foreign-owned commercial and individual deposits, one could attribute a portion of the total as being from Colombia, and a portion of that as being cocaine-related. Each of these steps would obviously require crucial assumptions and some idea of the degree of approximation being used. <p> Since much of the drug-related funds are laundered before entering the Florida economy, even estimates of Colombian bank deposits in the state would greatly underestimate the actual inflows. As discovered by the Treasury Department 's money laundering unit, a wide variety of schemes are used to circumvent US law and avoid disclosure of the ownership and source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depositing funds in an offshore account before redepositing them in a Florida account can effectively hide the original source country and depositor. Thus it does not appear fruitful to try to estimate the economic impact on Florida via calculations of Colombian bank deposits there or via efforts to estimate the amount of money laundered before arriving in Florida. <p> Another effort to measure the initial funds flow can be made using data compiled by the Drug Enforcement Agency concerning the profits generated by stages in cocaine production and distribution. Figure 2, from the Wall Street Journal( 30 June 1986), uses these data to present estimates of the profits per 300-kilogram shipment of cocaine that go to each participant in the " industry. " <p> These data indicate that about $15,000-per-kilo of cocaine go to the refiner -- but that $5,000-per-kilo go also to each pilot and wholesaler, and even more to distributors and dealers. These prices from 1986 must be reduced to reflect current( 1988) market conditions, in which the value per kilo is about $12,000. 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that approximately 400 metric tons of cocaine were produced in South America in 1988( NNICC, 1989 : 39). Subtracting from that an estimated 90 metric tons of cocaine interdicted by law enforcement efforts, we are left with 310 metric tons of cocaine that could have entered the US market in 1988. Following this line of reasoning, income to the Colombian refiners can be approximated as 310 tons x $12,000 per kilo -- $3,720 million in 1988. <p> The additional income earned by pilots and wholesalers( who may be Colombian, US, or of some other nationality) can be calculated as approximately 1/3 of that earned by the refiners, or $1.240 billion in 1988. This calculation uses the Wall Street Journal estimate of distribution of profits in the narcotrade and the 1988 estimate of the price of one kilo of cocaine in Miami. Since approximately 70% of the cocaine imported into the United States is estimated to enter through Florida( and the rest through California, Texas, and other states), we estimate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used in Florida. This leaves a Florida income of $868 million. <p> Finally, there is income generated at the level of drug dealers in Florida. Again working with the profit distribution as calculated in the Wall Street Journal study, and updating the price of cocaine to 1988, we can arrive at an estimate of income earned by these participants in the drug trade. One additional piece of information needed at this stage is the amount of consumption of cocaine in Florida. Since we do not have such an estimate, some approximation is required. We can take total available production( 310 metric tons) and divide it into the proportion of the US population who reside in Florida to derive potential consumption within the state. In 1985, Florida 's population was 4.7% of the US total( University of Florida, 1987 : 4). This leads to an estimate of possible consumption of 14.6 metric tons. At a 1988 street price of $30 per gram( or $30,000 per kilo), the total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $438 million. <p> In summary, the 1988 incomes obtained by each participant in the cocaine trade are estimated as shown in Table 6. See below. <p> It is necessary to attribute some portion of this income to possible investment/depositing in Florida, such that we could begin to estimate the consequent economic impact. While no direct estimates are possible, it is possible to use an alternative sample of Colombian businesspeople to infer behavior of the cocaine refiners. In an annual survey of businesspeople in Call and Bogota in May of 1988, the University of Miami found that the respondents would invest 73% of their available funds in Colombia and only 27% overseas( IBBI, 1988 : 7). This would mean a maximum of $1,004 million that would have been invested by the Colombian refiners in US deposits or investments. <p> Presumably the pilots, wholesalers, distributors, and dealers in Florida would initially put virtually all of their incomes into Florida deposits, or other holdings, and then spend( or invest) portions on local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full $1,678 million into available funds for investing and spending by these traffickers. Assessing the Full Investment/Spending Impact <p> Assuming that the initial level of income generated by the cocaine traffic between Colombia and Florida to the refiners is on the order of $3.7 billion per year during 1988, probably 95% of it will enter the US financial system as dollar deposits at some time. As already estimated above, about $1 billion will be invested outside of Colombia, some of it in Florida. Spending by the recipients of this income will typically be some large fraction of the total income, on the order of 95%, with the rest saved in financial instruments and other investments. 17 This would produce $3,534 million of spending by the refiners, some of which would go to buy Florida products and services. If even one-fourth of the spending takes place in Florida, or on products and services produced in Florida, the largest direct impact of the refiners ' income will be about $884 million. <p> The pilots, wholesalers, distributors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomes similarly to others in this country, with about 95% going into consumption and the rest into savings. The $1,678 million of incomes would result in $1,594 million of initial spending, most of which would probably take place in Florida( though not necessarily on products produced in Florida). <p> Thus total first-round spending in Florida, by all of the participants in the cocaine traffic, is estimated at about $2,478 million in 1988. 18 This value must be increased by the amount of capital investment created by the Colombian refiners ' use of their funds. We estimated that they probably invested about $1,004 million outside of Colombia in 1988. Most of these funds would have been placed into financial investments, though some portion was surely invested in real estate, ongoing businesses, and other capital projects. Assuming that at most 25% of these funds were invested in capital investments, we add $251 million to the total economic impact on Florida of narcotraffickers spending and investment. The grand total is then estimated at approximately $2,729 million. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, at about $2.7 billion, is far less than the costs incurred in Florida for law enforcement, medical expenses, drug rehabilitation programs, and lost employee production, estimated at about $4.5 billion for the year. Figure 3 presents summary data on the full economic impact. ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS <p> To draw useful conclusions from the above measures of economic costs and benefits of the cocaine trade in Florida, one needs relevant comparisons with alternative conditions that might exist. First, it is useful to explore the possibility that cocaine interdiction could be totally successful in eliminating the supply of the drug in Florida( and presumably the United States). Second, it would be helpful also to explore the implications of legalizing the traffic in, and consumption of, cocaine, which is an occasionally-recommended alternative to the present strategy of partial interdiction. <p> The possibility of total interdiction of cocaine from the US market implies a successful law enforcement effort to stop the boats, airplanes, land vehicles( through Mexico), and other means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Given that the existing law enforcement efforts have been successful in interdicting, at most, 90tons/400tons( about 25% of total estimated production), the cost of total interdiction could not be less than about four times the current level. Of course, this estimate is wildly optimistic since cocaine traffickers could be expected to alter their strategies in response to greater law enforcement efforts -- to protect their billions of dollars of annual revenues. Given that, in previous instances, there has not been a single case of totally successful interdiction of other narcotics, it could even be argued that the cost of such a policy would be infinitely high. <p> Under a scenario of total interdiction, the costs of work lost due to cocaine consumption would be eliminated. This would result in huge savings if it occurred in isolation. If, however, cocaine consumption were replaced by consumption of other narcotics, such as heroin or the synthetic drugs that have been appearing in the 1970s and 1980s, the net benefit would be much less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which other drugs were substituted for cocaine. The unhappy fact is that many cocaine users have also been identified as users of other drugs as well so that, in many cases, substitution is a strong possibility. <p> In the state of Florida, the net result from these conditions would be a large increase in expenditures on law enforcement, some of which would be subsidized by taxpayers in other states who pay part of the costs of the Federal agencies. Costs due to production lost and to rehabilitation would decline, perhaps significantly, depending on the degree to which other drugs were substituted for the interdicted cocaine. On the benefit side, if the Colombian cocaine cartels lost their ability to enter the US market, Florida would receive less spending and investment( i.e., fewer benefits) than before, unless the substituted drugs led also to large revenues for traffickers in Florida. <p> The second alternative scenario that should be compared to the current situation is the possibility of legalizing cocaine traffic and consumption, possibly with restrictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large consumption tax, as in the case of alcoholic beverages. This policy would clearly eliminate most of the law enforcement problem( except for crimes committed while under the influence of cocaine and, possibly, consumption by those underage). On the other hand, legalization would unquestionably increase the level of consumption due to the elimination of sanctions and, most likely, a decline in the price of cocaine. Although taxes could be used to keep the price high, those very taxes would encourage contraband sales of cocaine by people seeking to avoid paying them. <p> Any increase in consumption would increase the problem of lost production, presumably in proportion to the increase. This would be a major cost to the Florida economy, given the current annual cost of almost $4 billion in lost production when the drug is illegal. Savings of less than $1 billion in law enforcement costs( even assuming that another illegal drug(s) does not substitute for cocaine and require continued law enforcement efforts) would be overwhelmed by the work lost by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In summary, there is no doubt that the net economic impact on the Florida economy of the cocaine traffic is quite negative. Even though the benefits of investments and consumption by cocaine traffickers in the state of Florida may be as much as $3 billion per year in the late 1980s, the costs of law enforcement, health services, and lost productivity are significantly greater. In 1988, the costs in the state of Florida have been estimated here to be on the order of $4.5 billion. <p> Obviously, much more detailed analysis is needed to measure the full costs of lost work and productivity by cocaine consumers and traffickers. Equally obviously, the estimates of drug money flows are very crude. On both of these subjects, more study is needed. If the crude measures are at all in the range of actual costs and benefits, then our conclusions will hold even with the further details. <p> Another consideration to keep in mind when interpreting this analysis is the size of the activity relative to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income of the state of Florida was approximately $170 billion. This places the cocaine traffic at about 2% of income produced in the state during that year. In this context, the costs and benefits are relatively unimportant. On the other hand, the other problems -- psychological, social, and legal -- created by drug abuse may be far more important to the society than these economic considerations. <p> a " The author would like to express his appreciation to the University of Miami Colombian Studies Project, directed by Bruce Bagley, for its financial support of this study. <p>
