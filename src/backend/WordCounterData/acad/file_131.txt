4018641 The largest body of brackish water in the world, the Baltic Sea, has severe problems of water pollution and environmental degradation. 1 As late as 1950, the Baltic Sea was still regarded as environmentally " healthy. " Since that time, however, the situation has changed dramatically. In spite of numerous protective efforts, the Baltic Sea 's rich biodiversity is threatened by environmental pollution that could cause irreversible damage to a sea that is an important source of economic activity and recreation for more than 80 million people who live along its coast and within its catchment area. <p> The Baltic Sea catchment area, or drainage basin, is home to 14 nations( see Figure 1 on page 9). Nine of them share the Baltic 's coastline : Sweden and Finland to the north ; Russia, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to the east ; Poland to the south ; and Germany and Denmark to the west. The catchment area also includes parts of Belarus, Norway, Ukraine, the Slovak Republic, and the Czech Republic because some of the rivers flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these countries are undergoing dramatic political, economic, and social changes. As the division of Europe into Western and Eastern blocs vanishes and the countries in the eastern and southern Baltic region lose their peripheral position, the region has chance of regaining its historical position as one of the major crossroads of economic exchange, as in the time of the Hanseatic League -- a mercantile organization of towns along the Baltic Sea and the North Sea from the 13th through 18th centuries that allowed trade to flow across the Baltic Sea without political obstacles. Certainly, such present cooperation as the recent establishment of the Union of the Baltic Cities and the Baltic Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs confirms this possibility( see the box on pages 12 and 13). <p> The Baltic Sea is important in several ways. Its coast is a popular vacation area ; therefore, the demand for tourist and recreation services is very high. The coastal areas also serve as spawning, nursery, and feeding grounds for several species of marine and freshwater fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cod dominate in open waters, and both marine and freshwater species inhabit coastal areas. The value of the catches, which amounts today to about 540 million European currency units( ECU) per year, is an indication of the considerable economic importance of the Baltic fishery. But above all, the Baltic Sea has an environmental significance of its own : It is a shared heritage to be preserved and managed as a common resource. Causes of Degradation <p> The Baltic Sea has a total surface area of 415 square kilometers and is naturally vulnerable to pollution because of its semi-closed character and particular hydrography. The link with the North Sea is very narrow, with the shallowest sill being only 18 meters d B link, the Baltic Sea is dominated by freshwater inputs. Vertical variations in salinity cause permanent stratification, hampering the exchange of oxygen in the deeper parts of the sea. In some years, as much as 100,000 square kilometers, close to one-fourth of the whole sea, approaches " dead bottom " conditions. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously aggravated by the destruction of its wetlands, particularly in the western parts of the catchment area. During the 19th century, coastal wetlands were ditched and drained to meet the demands of expanding agriculture. Wetlands have also been dredged or filled to make room for urban and industrial developments, including harbors. The consequences of these activities were not readily visible until the environmental situation in the Baltic Sea had further deteriorated. <p> Pollution reaches the Baltic Sea by a wide diversity of pathways. Diffuse " nonpoint " sources include airborne emissions and agricultural runoff, while point-source pollution from urban areas and industry -- including untreated sewage from 30 million people, wastewater from pulp-and-paper and other industries, toxic substances, and heavy metals -- is either directly discharged into the sea or carried into it by rivers. This devastating influx can be attributed to a host of different factors, including economic inefficiency, poor legislation, lack of enforcement, and institutional weaknesses. In general, however, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of problems than do the once centrally planned economies. In the former, municipal and industrial pollution loads have been significantly reduced over the last few decades, and product control measures have reduced the use of hazardous compounds. There is, however, still scope for improved control in some industries, such as pulp-and-paper. The total farming area in these countries is much smaller than in other parts of the basin, but intensive agricultural practices involve high use of chemicals, and better policies are needed to control nutrient releases. <p> In the countries that used to have centrally planned economies, pollution loads from various sources are still heavy although declining somewhat because of new control measures and the overall slowdown of economic activities in the past few years. In the past, the economic structure of these countries became skewed toward heavy industry dominated by large, state-owned monopolies. These industries used as much as two to three times more water and energy per unit of output than did similar industries in other countries of the basin. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such large industrial basins as Upper Silesia in Poland and Ostrava in the Czech Republic), coupled with inadequate wastewater treatment and limited emission control, resulted in very high levels of water and air pollution as well as large quantities of solid wastes. <p> The principal pollution sources for the Baltic Sea are municipalities, industries, and agriculture that are located not only on the coast but deep in the interior as well. Municipalities <p> In the formerly centrally planned economies, most of the water bodies, such as rivers, natural and man-made lakes, and groundwater aquifers, receive excessive amounts of untreated or insufficiently treated municipal wastewater. Existing facilities, including sewer systems and treatment plants, are generally inadequate, overloaded, and poorly maintained and operated. Moreover, large quantities of highly toxic industrial wastewater and chemical liquid wastes are discharged into the municipal sewage systems. For example, in the late 1980s, the city of St. Petersburg was responsible for about 90 percent of all copper and chromium discharged into the Gulf of Finland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment processes to operate efficiently. Without either pretreatment or the separation of noxious industrial wastes from household sewage, serious problems with sludge disposal also arise. Another important source of water pollution, and one which is attracting increasing attention, is storm water runoff from urban areas. <p> In the Nordic countries and in the western states of Germany, there have been substantial reductions in the pollution load discharged by municipalities during the last 20 years. The load of organic substances has been reduced from 50 to 5 percent and that of phosphorous from 25 to 10 percent of the amount generated by municipalities. For example, in Sweden and Finland, the average reduction efficiency for biochemical oxygen demand( BOD) and phosphorus in municipal sewage treatment plants exceeds 90 percent. Industries <p> Industrial restructuring is taking place in the formerly centrally planned economies, but it will take many years for the environmental effects of this process to become more visible. For the time being, industry continues to play a significant role in the discharge of polluting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chemical industries discharge a variety of inorganic wastes that affect water in diverse ways, including rendering it completely toxic. Synthetic chemical production creates new and more exotic types of waste. Many technologies are obsolete, the most dramatic examples being the paper mills in Kaliningrad, Russia, that were built at the end of the 19th century. Wastewater treatment installations typically suffer from the same problems as sewage treatment plants -- insufficiency, overloading, and poor operation and maintenance. <p> The pulp-and-paper industry, in particular, plays a significant role in the discharge of oxygen-consuming, nutrient-rich, and slowly degradable substances into the sea and river waters in the Baltic region. Most of the old mills are located in the Karelian, St. Petersburg, and Kaliningrad regions of Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. In Sweden and Finland, pulp-and-paper mills are located primarily in the catchments of the Bothnian Sea, Bothnian Bay, and the Gulf of Finland. Some of the mills already have closed circulation of process water in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further substitutes for chlorine- and sulfur-containing chemicals. <p> In the Baltic 's catchment area, about 400 million tons of solid waste of industrial and municipal origin are generated annually. In Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and the western states of Germany, hazardous wastes are handled separately from both household and regular industrial waste and are properly treated. Unfortunately, this is not the case in the remaining countries of the region, where thousands of poorly maintained or uncontrolled dumping sites contribute significantly to contamination of local aquifers, lakes, rivers, and ultimately the Baltic Sea. The lack of separation of various kinds of wastes is a major problem. Furthermore, the effects of past practices are monumental. For example, landfill and dumping sites around St. Petersburg contain about 200 million tons of mineral waste. In Poland, accumulated solid waste is estimated at 1,500 million tons. Agriculture <p> Important agricultural areas are located in Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, with the latter accounting for about 40 percent, or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catchment. Except in Poland, large, formerly state-owned farms dominate ; their average size is more than 5,000 hectares. In Poland, the ownership structure is different ; about 80 percent of agricultural land is in small family farms with an average size of about 5 hectares( although the number of large private farms is growing). <p> Agriculture in Denmark and southern Sweden relies quite heavily on fertilizers. Farming operations in the Danish part of the Belt Sea catchment, which has a total area of about 12,400 square kilometers, annually discharge about 30,000 tons of nitrogen into the sea, while operations in the much larger Vistula River basin, whose 166,000 square kilometers cover two-thirds of Poland and small portions of Belarus, the Slovak Republic, and Ukraine, discharge some 50,000 tons. As agriculture intensifies in Poland and other formerly communist countries, the overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides must be avoided and alternatives developed. Otherwise, nutrient loading of the Baltic Sea will increase dramatically. <p> At present, inputs of nitrogen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Baltic Sea. They originate from ammonia volatilization, nitrogen leaching( nitrate and organic nitrogen), phosphorus leaching, soil erosion, and the discharge of farm wastes, such as effluents from animal houses, manure storage, and silage heaps. Animal manures produced not only in the Baltic catchment but also in the North Sea catchment in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and France release ammonia into the atmosphere that is eventually deposited in the Baltic Sea. Nitrate leaching is mainly the result of inadequate handling and inefficient use of commercial fertilizers. Although livestock density is generally low, large animal farms -- for example, hog farms with 100,000 to 150,000 animals -- cause the most serious and difficult problems in handling animal manure. A Framework for Regional Action <p> The Baltic Sea 's environmental problems have been the concern of the surrounding countries for several decades. In 1974, inspired by the 1972 UN Conference on the Human Environment, the governments of the region signed the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Convention, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a provisional basis, and the convention formally entered into force in May 1980. The Helsinki Commission( HELCOM) is the steering agency for the convention. Unfortunately, until the relatively recent political changes in the Baltic region, the activities of HELCOM concentrated on the open sea. As long as the coastline was shared by countries belonging to different military blocs, the coastal waters were largely inaccessible, and only extremely limited data on land-based pollution sources were available. <p> About 15 years after signing the initial Helsinki convention and as soon as the political situation in the region had changed, the prime ministers of Poland and Sweden invited their colleagues from the other countries in the Baltic catchment to a conference held in Ronneby, Sweden, in September 1990. The participants at the Ronneby conference adopted the first Baltic Sea Declaration, which sets out a number of principles and priority actions necessary to enhance the Baltic environment. Most importantly, the conference signaled the launching of a concrete effort to " assure the ecological restoration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marine environment and preservation of its ecological balance. " 2 That effort is the Baltic Sea Joint Comprehensive Environmental Action Programme. The program was developed from 1990 to 1992 by a HELCOM ad hoc high-level task force( HLTF), which was a joint endeavor of the Baltic Sea countries( Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Sweden), the countries of the catchment area( Belarus, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Norway, and Ukraine), the Commission of the European Communities, and four international financial institutions( European Investment Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Nordic Investment Bank, and World Bank). Also invited to attend HLTF meetings were several organizations that acted as observers, including the International Baltic Sea Fisheries Commission, the Coalition Clean Baltic, Greenpeace, and the World Wide Fund for Nature. The task force used a variety of studies and sources of information to develop the program, including national plans prepared by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastern, southern, and southwestern parts of the catchment. 3 The prefeasibility studies and special topical studies 4 were financed by grants totaling 5 million ECU from the Commission of the European Communities, the governments of Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, and Sweden, the Nordic Project Export Fund, and Sweden 's World Wide Fund for Nature. In April 1992 in Helsinki, the Diplomatic Conference of Ministers of the Environment revised the 1974 Helsinki convention and approved the Baltic Sea Joint Comprehensive Environmental Action Programme. The Joint Comprehensive Programme <p> Nearly 20 years of scientific work by HELCOM committees and studies conducted for the HELCOM task force have followed ecological developments in the Baltic Sea catchment. This preparatory work for the program concluded that preventive and curative actions are necessary in all of the countries in the catchment to reduce the pollution load reaching the sea. Some of these actions are already under way : Some state-owned enterprises with polluting production activities have shut down ; wastewater treatment plants are planned or partly constructed ; new protected areas have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These ongoing activities require support ; in particular, new environmental policies and pollution control programs should be formulated and adopted in the formerly Eastern-bloc economies. The Strategy <p> The underlying strategy of the Baltic Sea Joint Comprehensive Environmental Action Programme consists of actions by each concerned government to carry out needed policy and regulatory reforms ; to build capacity ; and to invest in controlling pollution from point and nonpoint sources, safely disposing of or reducing the generation of waste, and conserving ecologically sensitive and economically valuable areas. To complement these activities, the program also includes elements to support applied research, environmental awareness, and environmental education. These actions will be phased in to keep pace with the gradually increasing capacity to raise funds and pay for the recurrent costs of environmental management in the transforming economies. For the first few years, emphasis will be placed on creating the enabling policymaking environment and institutional arrangements, on making limited investments in the highest priority projects, including pilot and demonstration projects, and on promoting private investment and initiative through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and western parts of the region are also an integral part of the joint comprehensive program and are expected to be financed from local resources. Program Components <p> The program consists of six components that comprise broad and distinct areas of action. The first component is a set of policy, legal, and regulatory reforms that establish a long-term.. environmental management framework in each country, including macroeconomic policies and incentives ; financial facilities, policies, and controls ; environmental standards and laws ; and the appropriate systems for monitoring and enforcing these laws. To accomplish these goals, the program will encourage participating governments to undertake studies of new legal regulatory arrangements and drafting of governmental and parliamentary decision documents ; policy studies of options, costs, and benefits ; investment in new monitoring equipment, upgrading of laboratory equipment and procedures, and upgrading of data processing and analytical capacity ; and development of new organizational structures and arrangements to carry out management functions. The program will also promote the use of a range of economic measures for the management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polluter pays principle, " adoption of realistic user charges, and introduction of cost sharing principles in the case of trans-boundary pollution. In addition, the program will seek to promote the adoption of the best environmental practices and the use of the best available technologies to prevent pollution at the source, consistent with the 1992 Helsinki convention( an update of the 1974 convention that was signed at the Diplomatic Conference) and HELCOM recommendations. Actions that facilitate the transfer of technology between and within cooperating countries will also be encouraged. <p> The second component of the program is institutional strengthening and human resources development : building the organizational and human capacity to enforce regulations ; planning, designing, and implementing environmental management systems, including infrastructure ; and managing natural resources efficiently. The program focuses on training people to use new concepts of management and new technology and developing the organizational and administrative framework for people to work effectively and efficiently. Priority will be given to support for environmental planning, river basin management, coastal zone management, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental management, the program will support the development of effective local authorities that are responsible for water supply, wastewater, and disposal of solid wastes. The program will also support the development of local capacity to carry out environmental audits by training personnel from local industries, consulting firms, and regulatory organizations. <p> The third component is a program for infrastructure investment in specific measures to control point and nonpoint sources of pollution and to minimize and dispose of wastes. These measures include the rehabilitation and modernization of existing infrastructure ; the development of new infrastructure ; and the conservation of environmentally sensitive areas and resources. This program includes investments in three areas : Investments in municipal environmental management will emphasize the collection, treatment, and disposal of wastewater. Existing municipal water systems in the region commonly include all or most of the industrial wastewater within the service area of the sewer network, which means that they are functioning as combined municipal and industrial wastewater systems. The program will support national and local activities to rationalize municipal water consumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be provided for the completion of facilities already under construction, subject to design modification( taking a least-cost approach) and replacement of any substandard civil works. There are a number of such projects under way in the region 's " hot spots, " including Kaliningrad, Klaipeda, Liepaja, Tallinn, and Vilnius. Key operational problems, such as inadequate plant instrumentation and energy-inefficient equipment, will also be addressed. Industrial waste management at specific sites and complexes will also be financed. These projects are primarily for wastewater management, but they also address waste minimization, safe disposal of solid wastes, treatment and safe disposal of various forms of hazardous and toxic wastes, and environmental restoration from past degradation. Particular attention will be given to the pulp-and-paper industry, which has special significance in the region. Although this industry is perhaps most modern in the northern and western parts of the region, it is arguably one of the most outdated and inefficient in the eastern and southern portions. In both cases, the pulp-and-paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substances. In addition, priority will be given to addressing wastewater treatment in the chemical and metal production and processing industries. Controlling polluted water runoff and discharges from agricultural lands, large livestock operations, and rural settlements is also an investment priority. Agriculture and livestock are major contributors of nutrient loads to the sea. Control measures will involve a wide range of changes in farming practices, including modifications in the timing of manure application and tillage ; improvements in farm infrastructure, such as larger capacity and more secure storage for fertilizers, manure, and farm wastes ; changes in water use ; and new equipment, such as manure spreading and waste handling equipment. The program will also support investment activities to reduce pollution problems resulting from fish farming. <p> The fourth component of the program is to aid in the management of coastal lagoons and wetlands. These environmentally sensitive and economically valuable areas serve as important buffers of pollution before it reaches the sea and provide critical habitat for diverse flora and fauna, including commercially important fisheries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure and, in some cases, will be integrated with compatible ecotourism and recreation developments, possibly through joint public and private ventures or private investment. The program will support the development of a series of demonstration activities concerning the use of natural and constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment and storm water retention and as traps for nutrients and other pollutants. <p> The program 's fifth part is supporting applied research to build the knowledge base needed to develop solutions, transfer technology, and broaden understanding of critical problems. Specific priority topics include environmental trends ; systems ecology ; development and application of the " critical load " concept for different pollutants in the Baltic Sea and its subregions ; assessments of risks to human health ; agricultural development patterns in the Baltic Sea basin ; future trends in transportation and its environmental management ; and management of critical ecosystems, such as coastal lagoons and wetlands. <p> Finally, the program will encourage public awareness and environmental education to develop a broad and sustainable base of support for the implementation of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level and the development of effective environmental education programs are essential to promoting public awareness and political commitment. Efforts to promote and expand environmental education, particularly in the context of local environmental cleanup activities, will be given priority. <p> The 1992 Baltic Sea Declaration that was signed at the April 1992 Diplomatic Conference mandated that the key elements of the Joint Comprehensive Environmental Action Programme be initiated in 1993. Although the main responsibility for implementing the program will rest with the governments concerned, coordination of many program activities is needed. Such activities include monitoring pollution and the impact of the program, maintaining databases, reforming policies and regulations, providing technical assistance, planning research programs, and exchanging information, as well as periodically updating the program. To this end, the Programme Implementation Task Force has been set up within the framework of HELCOM. The Costs and Financing of the Program <p> The total cost of the 20-year program for all countries in the Baltic Sea catchment is estimated to be about 18 billion ECU( about $25.6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1997, is projected to cost about 5 billion ECU( about $6 billion).( See Table I on page 28.) <p> The program will focus on remediating 132 " hot spots "( see the map on page 14), 98 of them located in Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Poland, the Czech Republic, and the Slovak Republic. These 98 actions will cost about 8.5 billion ECU, out of which 6.5 billion ECU will go toward 47 " priority hot spots, " including 26 municipal spots, 9 industrial spots, and 12 others. The remaining 34 hot spots, located in Denmark, Finland, Germany, and Sweden, have been selected by these countries themselves, and their remediation will cost approximately 1.5 billion ECU. In Poland, which has the largest land area and population in the Baltic Sea catchment, the estimated cost for remediating the 40 recommended hot spots and priority hot spots exceeds 4.0 billion ECU( see " Report from Poland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the March 1991 Environment). <p> In phase 1 of the program 's implementation, the needs of 29 priority hot spots will be addressed, 19 in the Vistula and Oder river basins and 10 in Russia, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. In addition, major reductions in discharges of adsorbable organic halogens are planned for the pulp-and-paper industry in Finland and Sweden. <p> The immediate costs for the program total about 30 million ECU for the feasibility studies of the highest priority projects. Financial arrangements for the implementation of these projects can not be completed without the results of these studies. In addition, the governments in the eastern and southern parts of the catchment will need to arrange for local and external support to carry out the required policy and regulatory reforms. Timely implementation of the program critically depends on those and other noninvestment activities. To complicate matters, nearly two-thirds of the hot spots are located in countries whose current economic situation makes ordinary loans and commercial financing difficult. Therefore, some combination of normal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be needed from bilateral and multilateral financing agencies. Varied approaches to project financing are also needed, including enhanced local sources of revenue from taxes and user charges, user taxes on potentially polluting substances, and private investment that supplements traditional public-sector borrowing and budgetary resources. <p> In March 1993, at the High Level Conference on Resource Mobilization for the Baltic Sea Joint Comprehensive Environmental Action Programme in Gdansk, Poland, the participants stressed that availability of local or foreign funds is not the only constraint to program implementation ; several mutually related factors also limit the mobilization and flow of, and the capacity to use effectively, the funds that are available. Several important observations were made at the Gdansk conference. 6 First, the greatest proportion of project financing must come from local resources ; however, despite the efforts on the part of governments of the formerly communist countries, local resources will remain limited in the short term. Slow progress in this regard has been largely due to the precarious position of the economies in transition. Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action should be taken to support the establishment of financing mechanisms and incentives, to develop the institutional capacity to implement them, and to create greater public awareness of their importance. " 7 The principal local sources of funds available to support activities under the program include user charges, pollution fees, budgetary allocations and nonbudgetary incentives, domestic loans, and, potentially, private investments. Domestic loans may not be a major factor in the near term because local financial institutions, such as capital markets and banks, have not been sufficiently developed to support environmental improvements. <p> Under the current economic conditions, however, the concerned countries, municipalities, and enterprises have sought increased support for program financing from external sources. Although some of the potential donor countries are suffering from a protracted recession, " there will be a critical need, at least for the short term, for continued and better coordinated support from bilateral donor organizations to implement the Programme, especially to support policy, institutional development and investment project preparation activities. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the European Communities and bilateral donors, from both within and outside the region, has been an important source of support for program activities in recent years. <p> In addition, the conference participants anticipated that " the international financing institutions will continue to provide loans and implement projects for selected priority actions under the Programme consistent with the requests of the borrowers and within lending limits established by their credit worthiness. " 9 The level of investment by international financing institutions is determined by the priorities of the borrowing country, the levels of borrowing and indebtedness that present and anticipated economic conditions are able to support, the balance of investment activities between priority sectors, the quality of the proposed investment, and the related characteristics and conditions of the borrower. <p> During phase 1 of the program 's implementation, special emphasis " must be put on comprehensive feasibility studies that yield economically and financially feasible and affordable investment projects, and that devote more attention to the assessment of the current institutional framework and the formulation of measures to strengthen that framework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions will require special attention in phase 1, including local fundraising, support for institutional reforms, support for industries in transition, and the phasing in of investments requiring long development periods. <p> The conference also acknowledged that, in the formerly communist countries, pollution control " at the source " will have to be incorporated into the ongoing privatization, restructuring, and modernization of industries. In the municipal sector, innovative approaches -- such as joint ventures with foreign capital and long-term concessions -- will be needed to attract capital financing, especially from private and commercial sources. Investments in municipal wastewater treatment plants must be seen within the broader framework of developing autonomous self-financing municipal and regional water and wastewater utilities, whether public or private. " 11 <p> The environment ministers and other representatives of the governments of the Baltic Sea countries and the representative of the Commission of the European Communities assembled at the Gdansk conference jointly decided to make all efforts to mobilize local, national, bilateral, and multilateral financial and other resources for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Phase 1 investment activities will concentrate on improving combined municipal and industrial wastewater treatment to reduce organic pollution loads. High-priority projects are the completion of unfinished or inoperable treatment facilities, the installation or improvement of pretreatment of industrial wastewater discharges into the municipal sewage systems, and the expansion of safe disposal of sludges. In the formerly centrally planned economies, nutrient-removal facilities( tertiary treatment) at municipal wastewater treatment plants will be deferred until more substantial progress is achieved in nutrient reductions in the agricultural sector. <p> As discussed at the Gdansk conference, 13 initial program activities have emphasized the establishment of priorities at the national level and detailed preparation of projects, including feasibility studies. Out of the 29 priority hot spots to be addressed in phase 1, detailed feasibility studies are under way or are planned at 17 of the 26 priority municipal hot spots ; and environmental audits have been carried out at 6 of the 9 priority industrial hot spots. In addition, an economic and environmental assessment of the region 's pulp-and-paper industry was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the region 's 34 pulp-and-paper mills and focused on 12 mills that are candidates for feasibility studies and possible investment support. <p> The development of control programs for nonpoint source pollution in the agricultural and livestock sectors requires a different approach. The emphasis in phase 1 is on establishing an effective institutional framework and on developing and implementing well-designed pilot and demonstration activities. Seven pilot studies and programs have been established for the control of agricultural and livestock runoff in hot spot areas of Russia( at a major hog farm in the St. Petersburg region), Estonia( protection of groundwater from agricultural pollution), and Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland( testing ecotechnologies in small catchment areas). Thirteen surveys, studies, and pilot programs have been established or are planned in the most important wetland areas and in the key coastal lagoons, which are mostly in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. In addition, the World Wide Fund for Nature, in cooperation with the countries of the region, is developing a regional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central Matsalu Bay in Estonia, the north coast of Latvia, and Putsk Bay, which is a subsection of Gdansk Bay in Poland. <p> Although several factors have combined to slow the rate at which resources are committed to and used for various program activities, the first year of implementation has demonstrated that, despite all difficulties, a great deal can be accomplished. The foundations established during this early phase will ensure the long-term success of the Baltic Sea Joint Comprehensive Environmental Action Programme. Expected Environmental Benefits <p> The program is expected eventually to have a major impact on the rivers in the Baltic Sea catchment, which are the principal source of water supply for industry, agriculture, and about 80 million people. Reducing pollution loads and restoring aquatic ecosystems will increase the quality and reliability of water resources and benefit the health and well-being of the local population. <p> The coastal waters are expected to improve most rapidly, which would allow several contaminated beaches to open again and contribute to re-establishing favorable conditions for tourism and local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should reduce algal blooms, assist in lowering eutrophication levels, and improve oxygen conditions. These improvements should have a major positive impact on fishery resources, including an increase in the number and diversity of commercially valuable fish species, such as whitefish, cod, and plaice. The quality of the open sea will be restored more slowly, however, because of the difficulty in controlling long-range atmospheric transportation of various pollutants. <p> Another benefit of the program to Baltic countries is the strengthening of local capacities to plan, finance, and manage environmental measures. The strategic gains from capacity building for environmental cleanup will be of particular importance in the formerly centrally planned economies, which are undergoing profound institutional as well as economic changes. <p> Given the current state of the Baltic Sea environment, however, the program can not be expected to make any major impacts for about 20 years. But gradual and visible improvements, both environmental and economic, can be realized in the relatively near future. <p>
