4001441 Our purpose in this study is to view theories of psychotherapy from a general social-political context, especially insofar as they pertain to values. Beginning with Weisskopf-Joelson 's( 1980) thesis that theories of psychotherapy may be " perceptual houses " with their own unique value structures, we studied the values of psychoanalytic psychotherapists within the framework of Rokeach 's( 1968) system. Through the Rokeach Value Survey, we examined the values held by a group of psychoanalytic trainees in 1979 and those held by a group of practicing psychoanalysts in 1993. Because neither group of subjects can be regarded as randomly representative of the universe of psychoanalysts, we regard the resultant data as evocative and informative rather than definitive. Nonetheless, we examined the extent to which value profiles for the psychoanalytic trainees of 1979 were similar or dissimilar to those of practicing psychoanalysts in 1993. Such comparisons at the least provide some general indication as to whether valu es have shifted in the universe within this time period. Findings are presented about specific patterns of values, and implications are discussed. There appears to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we studied, lending support to this discipline 's designation of a " perceptual house " insofar as its values are concerned. <p> Values seem to evoke much discussion and controversy. In the public domain, " family " values, " religious " values, " good " values, or " bad " values are discussed as if their criteria are self-evident. In addition, values have generated interest in such areas as " moral " and " value " education and " values clarification. " This pervasiveness attests to the importance of the notion as well as to its lack of clarity. People have values. Institutions have values. Societies have values. These seem to be accepted truths, although they remain vague and general. Not surprisingly, the field of psychotherapy has not been immune from the wide ranging, yet imprecise, presence of the elusive construct of values. <p> Schwartz( 1990) examined the ways in which values are embodied in social institutions and the ways in which social institutions influence the values of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embodies individual values when, in the normal course of its operation, the institution offers people roles that encourage behavior expressing those values and fosters conditions for their further expression... The values that an individual can express are very much constrained by the character of the social institutions and the social order in which that individual lives( p. 8). <p> Rokeach( 1979), in addressing this issue, defined institutional values as " socially shared cognitive representations of institutional goals and demands "( p.50) and suggested that " the most distinctive property or defining characteristic of a social institution is its values "( p.51). <p> Scientific psychology has consistently kept the question of values out of its system, in its attempt to stress the scientifically objective component of its field( Harari, 1989 ; Freud, 1934). In this context, it is interesting to find that some authors see psychotherapy as sharing the interactional arena with the arts, in that they both feature the constant interchange between values and technique( Gorelick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledged and dismissed the issue of values in psycho therapy. As a scientific endeavor, he asserted, psychoanalysis did not require or possess a value system distinct from the values of science, which it embraced. This traditional position on values remained the prevalent stance in psychoanalysis( Harari, 1989) even though it was understood that people could not maintain this ideal objective stance. It would appear that, although values were recognized as inevitable, the ideal remained of a possible value-free endeavor, and deviation there-from were seen as problems of the therapist or labeled as " countertransference. " Indeed, values have often been noted in psychotherapy in a negative context -- i.e., as a problem when therapy is not proceeding according to the " script. " Myriads of case presentations point to values as the culprit in the derailing of the psychotherapeutic paradigm, as exemplified by Cabaniss, Oquendo, and Singer 's( 1994) exploration of the effect of psychoanalytic culture( i.e., the analyst-patient) and its values on the **32;1554;TOOLONG process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that values are often discussed in the current literature, even in settings which are quite removed from psychotherapy( Sankowski, 1989). <p> In a circumscribed context, however, values were reckoned with in a positive perspective. Hartman( 1960) conceptualized one prevalent view by positing that the only values that are relevant in psychotherapy are so called " health values, " or those very directly related to the work at hand. These " health values " have generated definitions ranging from Freud 's( 1989/1934) truth and reality, to the sufficient conditions for the nurturing of the ego( Hartmann, 1960), the facilitating environment of Object Relations theory( Winnicott, 1965), the definition of the self( Kohut, 1977), awareness and integration in a Gestalt perspective( Perls et al., 1951), and Rogers '( 1961) basic therapeutic conditions, to present a representative sample. This rich diversity of definitions seems to restrict the concept of values within the parameters of the particular concepts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that values are not usually highlighted in orthodox analyses of the psychotherapeutic process. Instead, they are often featured in fields which represent the intersections of psychotherapy and allied disciplines. The contemporary psychosomatic approach incorporates values into its presuppositions( Sanders, 1988). The hermeneutic method of analyzing psychotherapy, for example, refers to " guiding values " of the conversation which effects change( Barnes, 1993). The adherents of Logotherapy blatantly present their approach as a system of values similar to those of a secular religion( Kreitmer, 1992). Related to the latter characterization, is the assumption in existential psychology that one 's attitude toward authenticity is influenced by the therapist 's personal values( Rubinstein, 1994). <p> Moreover, values are intrinsic to some of the more recent areas where psychology and social issues have been synthesized. Constructivism, for example, sees values as playing a central role in clinical practice( Dean, 1993). Kelly 's Personal Construct Psychology, in particular, sees an integral relationship between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its theory( Walker, 1992). Other authors actually typify feminist-oriented psychotherapy by positing a distinct value profile for the approach( Lakin, 1991). Postmodern authors on psychotherapy uniformly highlight the salience of the practitioner 's values( Chapman, 1993). <p> An index of values ' emerging prominence in the field is the recent straightforward call by the Society for the Exploration of Psychotherapy Integration, calling for the definition of psychotherapy integration while highlighting values as a cardinal factor in therapy( Beitman, 1994). It is noteworthy that the directionality of influence between psychotherapy and values also runs in the reverse. Thus, criteria have been offered for therapists to determine whether their clients ' religiosity is particularly healthy or unhealthy( Bergin, 1991), which seems to portend an attempt at objectively qualifying the legitimacy( rather than functionality) of values in the counseling interaction. In categorizing values by the phenomena which precipitate and give rise to the values, some authors have been led to actually categorize values as rational vs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, however, that values are, by definition, not based on logic, making the rational evaluation of values an oxymoron at best <p> It can be argued that all of the contemporary therapies are oriented at the tension between individual and societal values. Specifically, individual values will often entail goals which encroach on others ' needs, while societal values often usurp individual needs for the good of the larger group. The therapies can be seen as attempting to balance intrinsic values against the backdrop of a field-wide mor of commitment to human freedom without dogmatism, in a mode which will respect human autonomy. In a detailed analysis of therapy approaches, Richardson( 1989) shows how Freud, Jung, Fromm, and Rational Emotive approaches all employ similar strategies in dealing with this freedom-commitment dilemma, although each stresses different aspects as primary. Since each conceptual orientation presents a somewhat different emphasis in value orientation, it would appear that Weisskopf-Joelson( 1980) is correct when she sees the pervasiveness of different values in various schools of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceptual houses " to which clients are converted. Weiskopf-Joelson refers to each school of psychotherapy as a " perceptual house " since each perspective brings with it a distinct set of preconceptions and apperceptions which structure reality according to its a priori postulates and beliefs. These " houses " include value systems which, though rarely explicit, are nonetheless normative in that setting and are seen as desirable goals of any therapeutic intervention. If they are " perceptual houses, " then they are not merely a collection of individuals but have more the qualities and characteristics of an institution. <p> It follows, then, that as a prototype of an institution, each therapeutic community should feature a shared value system. Indeed, studies pursuing this thesis have been done in evaluating cross-cultural applications of counseling. For example, a particular analysis of Japanese-based psychotherapies analyzed differential approaches, concluding that goals are central to all approaches and that there is evidence of universal values in defining the fully functioning self. The researchers conceptualized cultural differences in the divergence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relationship of individual vs. interpersonal values within each culture( Noon and Lewis, 1992). This approach has, in fact, resulted in some authors conceptualizing the psychotherapeutic process as " healing by culture "( Havenaar, 1990). <p> The exploration of societal values has been stressed as beneficial for discrete subpopulations. Some stress it as crucial for the therapeutic process in dealing specifically with adolescents( Ponton, 1993). Other foci seem to limit the salience of values only to specific contextual environments. As an example of the salience of values by treatment context, consider the conflict of the college based therapist, whose very work is embedded in an institution whose values have little relation to psychology. In such instances, it would be disruptive, both to the therapy process and to the client, to proceed without a keen awareness of the values of the host institution( May, 1991). <p> It is not surprising that the confluence of religion and psychotherapy is marked by pointed attention to personal values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in espousing the centrality of values. Detailed prerequisites are offered for the counselor entering the field, and research data are offered that a client who has knowledge about the counselor 's values and goals prior to psychotherapy is more able to make informed choices( Lewis and Epperson, 1991). The non-sectarian Pastoral Counseling actually defines its uniqueness in the assumed similarity of values between therapist and client( Peterson, 1990). Moreover, some authors interpret the psychotherapeutic process in Pastoral Counseling as a moral enterprise( Erickson, 1989). <p> Clearly, this approach need not be limited to the specific cultural, age-limited, or contextual therapies at all. It is posited that any therapeutic approach embodies its own unique value structure. The purpose of this investigation was to explore that value system of therapists adhering to a particular theoretical orientation. <p> Since the issue under investigation is whether theoretical orientations in their institutional manifestation become " perceptual houses " which might have a shared value system, it was imperative that the values not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general field of " mental health. " This eliminated our use of any of the instruments addressing " mental health " values, which may well be shared by those within the profession. One instrument which fits this criteria was the values survey developed by Rokeach( 1968) which has been most widely used to assess similar questions with a variety of populations. A search of Dissertation Abstracts Ondisc shows forty-nine citations for the instrument from 1975 to 1982, eighty citations from 1983 to 1988, forty-four citations from 1989 to 1993, and thirty citations from 1994 through September of 1997. A search of Psychlit shows 243 journal article citations from 1974 to 1990 and fifty-four journal article citations from 1991 through September of 1997. A search of ERIC shows forty-one educational citations from 1982 to 1991 and thirteen educational citations from 1992 to June of 1997. <p> Rokeach( 1979) conceptualized human value systems as consisting of a relatively small number of core ideas or cognitions present in every society. The following definitions of " value " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that a person has a value is to say that he has an enduring prescriptive or proscriptive belief that a specific mode of behavior or end-state of existence is preferred to an opposite mode of behavior or end-state. This belief transcends attitudes toward objects and toward situations ; it is a standard that guides and determines action, attitudes toward objects and situations, ideology, presentations of self to others, evaluations, judgments, justifications, comparisons of self with others, and attempts to influence others( Rokeach, 1973, p.25). <p> In terms of context, Rokeach( 1968) suggested that values exist in hierarchies or priorities which involve the selection and organization of values into systems. In other words, values are not static and do not stand alone, but in relationship to each other. It is the system and the relationship of values to each other for a person at a particular time that are the most meaningful representations of the system. <p> These ideas can be organized into at least two systems representing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as desirable end states of existence. Simply put, these values are, in fact, goals. Instrumental Values, defined in the literature as desirable modes of behavior instrumental to the attainment of these end states. Simply put, these values are means to an end. <p> In his approach to the subject, Rokeach studied the value structure of institutions and was emphatic that the values of members of the institution( gatekeepers) are among the most sensitive indicators of the values of an institution, since these values serve the dual functions of both reflecting and reinforcing the values within a particular social institution. THE STUDIES <p> This paper reports findings of two studies of the values of **27;1588;TOOLONG psychotherapists which were conducted approximately fourteen years apart. Data collection for the first study was begun in 1978 and completed in 1979, while those for the second study were begun in 1992 and completed in 1993. Both studies used the Rokeach Values Survey( RVS) at a prominent New York City psychoanalytic training program. It was assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reflected in some of the values shifts, but that some of the consistency, if any, might be attributed to a shared professional identity and socialization. Procedures <p> One theoretical orientation, psychoanalysis, was selected for examination to determine whether a group that shares a theoretical orientation also shares a value orientation. This theoretical orientation appears to fit Weisskopf-Joelson 's( 1980) definition of a " perceptual house. " In 1978 and again in 1992, the administration of a well-known training program in psychoanalysis and psychotherapy consented to facilitate data collection within their program. In 1978, the first author participated in a weekend retreat, giving a short talk on values research and then presented a general overview of this study. At the conclusion of the presentation, he asked the members to volunteer to participate in the study. Their anonymity was guaranteed. Research packets, which included a short demographic questionnaire and a copy of the RVS, were left on a conveniently located table. There was also a drop-off box for the completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author. <p> In 1992, individual packets were mailed to all members of the same training program. These packets contained a cover letter describing the study which guaranteed anonymity and requested voluntary participation. Enclosed was a demographic questionnaire, the RVS, and a pre-paid return envelope.( The data for the second study only became available recently, as they were held up for years by bureaucratic issues beyond the authors ' control.) Participants <p> The participants in these studies were all members of a **27;1617;TOOLONG psychotherapeutic training program. These were primarily post-doctoral level psychologists who went on for further training. For the first study, fifty-nine of the eighty-nine( 66%) program participants took packets ; all were returned. Respondents included twenty-seven males, twenty-eight females, and four whose gender were not identified.( Racial data were not solicited in the first study. However, by recollection there were only two Black and three Latino program participants among an otherwise all White population.) For the second study, there were a total of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 407 women. There were 179 usable questionnaires and values surveys returned( Return rate = 25.7%). The results from the demographic questionnaire for the second group revealed the following profile of the sample : sixty-six( 36.9%) were male and 113( 63.1%) were female ; participant age ranged from thirty-nine to seventy-nine years old ; 159( 88.9%) stated that they were White, three( 1.7%) identified themselves as Black, one(.6%) as Asian, and sixteen( 8.9%) did not respond to the item. The participants reported twenty-eight different ethnic descriptions. The predominant one, reported by 115( 64.2%), was Jewish, and twenty-two( 12.3%) did not re-Katz, Juni, and Matz 345 spend to the item. Of the remaining, the range varied from WASP to Italian-American, to West Indian, to Irish American, to such descriptions as Catholic-Swiss-Italian, American-Mongrel, **27;1646;TOOLONG, and Chinese-English, to cite a selected sample. Instrument <p> The Rokeach Value Survey( RVS) consists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idealized end-states of existence ; and 18 Instrumental values, or desirable codes of behavior( Rokeach, 1968). The RVS has been shown to differentiate among a variety of populations on various dimensions which include religion, occupation, social class, ethnicity, culture, political orientation, etc., to cite a selected sample( Beech, 1970 ; Feather, 1986 ; Katz &; Beech, 1978, 1980 ; Katz, Juni, Shope, &; Tang, 1993 ; Rokeach, 1968, 1973, 1979). To complete the instrument, respondents are asked to rank order the values presented from most to least important to them. They are told to place a " 1 " next to the value that was most important to them, a " 2 " for the second most important value, and so on, until all eighteen values are ranked. This procedure is followed for both the Terminal and Instrumental values. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION <p> The results of this investigation will be presented to highlight the values of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To organize the data, we will present the results focusing on : The average numerical( rank) level of each value for the two time periods. The rank order position( for the entire sample) and changes therein of each value within the value system. We chose the benchmark of a rank order change of four positions to signify a meaningful shift in values between the two periods. <p> These methods offer very different kinds of information. Rokeach argued that the former provided statistical significance and the latter greater psychological significance. These are not contradictory endeavors when using an ipsative scale( which the Rokeach Value Survey is), and therefore both will be reported and discussed. <p> Table 1 presents the comparison of the 1979 and 1993 rankings and means of the Terminal values using the RVS. Using the two analytic methods, there are seven Terminal values which differ significantly( beyond the.05 level) between the two time periods. These are, in order of descending statistical significance : Family Security(.001) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Comfortable Life, Freedom, Inner Harmony, and Pleasure(.05). As can be seen, A Comfortable Life, Equality, and Family Security were ranked higher in 1993 than in 1979, while Freedom, Inner Harmony, and Pleasure were ranked lower. Mature Love remains the most important value, although its mean drops much lower by 1993. Thus, it would appear that these two populations differed on these seven values when the values are considered in isolation rather than as part of an overall value system. <p> In applying the second analytic method of meaningful rank-order change within the values system, utilizing a shift of four or more ranking positions as the criterion for meaningful change, two values meet this criterion : Family Security becomes more important( from 8 to 3) while Inner Harmony decreases in importance( from 4 to 8). It is noteworthy in this context that Family Security becomes part of the top four values while Inner Harmony drops out that salient group. <p> It is remarkable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time periods were all in the salient group of values, as defined by the criterion of the upper and lower four rankings. For example, A Comfortable Life shifted from rank 16( the very low) in 1979 to a 1993 ranking of 13. Family Security, on the other hand, shifted from a ranking of 8 in 1979 to 3 in 1993. Mature Love, by contrast, is an interesting value to acknowledge, as its mean rank shifts from 3.47 to 4.87, yet its rank position remains the same( 1) in both time periods. Of the seven values whose means were significantly different from 1979 to 1993, four of the means were higher while three were lower. Such a complementarity in shift, however, is likely due to the ipsative nature of rank-order data which mandates that any shift in one direction be accompanied by a complementary shift in the other. <p> The two analytic methods present different, but not contradictory, findings. They do seem to reflect changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions. Certain of the responses were statistically significant over time, but did not reflect changes in the overall value system as a whole.( For example, the mean value of Mature Love shifted from 3.47 to 4.87, while its rank remained 1 for both time periods.) Other values, however, showed shifts in rank order which corresponded to the statistically significant shifts in the mean values respectively( as exemplified by Family Security and Inner Harmony). Table 2 presents the comparison of the 1979-1993 rankings of the Instrumental Values. Three Values that were statistically significantly different( Imaginative, Independent, and Responsible). Of the three, Responsible also reflects a meaningful change in four rank order positions( from 7 to 3). The other two( Imaginative and Independent) reflect shifts in only three rank order positions, falling short of our criterion for meaningful change. On the other hand, Intellectual has the distinct differential feature of showing a rank order change of four positions, but failing to reach statistical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two time periods is their shared level of consistency. Besides the above noted changes, fifteen of the eighteen mean pairs do not differ significantly, while thirteen reflect a value position change of 1 or less. <p> Another way of understanding the importance and resonance of values is to examine those that are most important and those that are least important to the respondents. The senior author, who has been using the RVS for more than 25 years, has often asked respondents about the experience of ranking the two sets of 18 values. One of the " consensual " responses was that people seem to approach the scale with greatest clarity at the extremes. They know what they value most and what they value least with greater definitiveness than those that fall more in the mid-range of the scale. This differential can be examined by highlighting these values in the context of the entire values system of the respondents. Table 3 presents the Terminal Value hierarchies from 1979 to 1993. It includes the means for each value( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of four values respectively. <p> A review of Table 3 reveals that 3 of the 4 top values remain in the same upper cluster from 1979 to 1993 : Mature Love( 1 to 1), Self-Respect( 2 to 2), and True Friendship( 3 to 4). Inner Harmony, ranked 4 in 1979, drops to 8 in 1993, and is replaced by Family Security in the upper cluster. A review of the lower cluster reveals that two of the four remain in the same respective positions( Salvation -18 and National Security -17). A Comfortable Life( 16 to 13) and Equality( 15 to 12) drop out of the lower cluster and are replaced by Pleasure( 13 to 16) and Social Recognition( 11 to 15) by 1993. <p> The other method of assessing value change, as noted earlier, is movement of at least 4 rank order positions. As can be seen in Table 3, Family Security( 8 to 3), Inner Harmony( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 15) all exhibit such shifts. Parenthetically, all three involve shifts, either into or out of, the salient clusters at the two extremes of the continuum. <p> Table 4 presents the Instrumental Value hierarchies from 1979 to 1993. It includes the means for each value and demarcates the highest and lowest group of four values respectively. As can be seen, two of the four top ranked values remain unchanged( Loving at 1, and Honest at 2). Independent drops from 3 to 6, while Courageous drops from 4 to 7. These values are replaced in the top cluster by Responsible( which rises from 7 to 3) and Capable( 5 to 4). All four of the lower cluster of values remain unchanged. Applying the value change criterion of four places identifies two values which shifted meaningfully -- Responsible( which rises from 7 to 3) and Intellectual( which rises from 9 to 5). <p> If we reflect on the stability of the most and least resonant values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the identification of the enduring values and value system of psychoanalytic psychotherapists, based on the consistency of certain values in their relative positions across time -- in this case from 1979 to 1993. For the Terminal values, Mature Love, Self-Respect, and True Friendship are clearly most important. Salvation and National Security are evidently least important within this values system. For the Instrumental values, Loving and Honest maintained their positions as most important values over time, while Obedient, Clean, Polite, and Self-Controlled remained in the least important group. These results represent a consistency that can not be ignored. <p> Paralleling the pattern of the value rankings in Tables 1 and 2, these results likewise point to both stability and change in the values system of this group of psychoanalytic psychotherapists. Over a fourteen-year period, given all of the social and political changes which occurred in the interim -- in the profession, the country, and the greater world -- this Terminal value structure has maintained the primacy of Mature Love, Self-Respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the dramatic environmental changes during this period, reflected in managed care private practice, the reduction in academic employment opportunities, the loss of Internship Sites -- in the professional realm, as well as the shift from a cold war status to one of U.S. hegemony, and other political cataclysmic changes with the collapse of the Soviet Empire and the change of the regime in China -- in the greater world.) At the other end of the scale, Salvation and National Security persevere. <p> Rokeach( 1973) conceptualized Terminal Values as consisting of two domains representing personal goals and social goals respectively. Personal Goals are intrapersonal and self-centered, whereas social goals are interpersonal and society-centered. The eighteen Terminal Values consist of values that reflect thirteen Personal Goals and five values that reflect Social Goals( Kelly &; Strupp, 1992 ; Rokeach, 1973). These two categories are as follows : <p> Personal Goals : A Comfortable Life, An Exciting Life, Family Security, Happiness, Inner Harmony, Mature Love, Pleasure, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recognition, True Friendship, Wisdom. Kelly &; Strupp( 1992) used a version of the RVS that includes the value Health and excludes the value Happiness( We used the version that excludes Health and includes Happiness in the Personal Goals subgroup.) <p> Social Goals : Equality, Freedom, National Security, A World of Peace, A World of Beauty. <p> A review of the results indicates that although two of the Social Goals were significantly different in their statistical mean shift( Equality and Freedom), none reflected meaningful rank-order changes. In addition, Table 3 shows that the top four Terminal Values in 1979, as well as the top four Terminal Values in 1993, were all related to Personal Goals. Psychoanalysis appears then to embrace a value system that emphasizes personal over social goals. <p> This emphasis on personal rather than social values for psychoanalytic psychotherapists is understandable, since both theory and practice focus on the individual and their very personal struggles. The primacy of intrapsychic struggles and the centrality of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in concordance with a personal value emphasis as compared to a social value emphasis. <p> Table 5 presents the analysis of gender differences for Terminal Values between these populations of psychoanalytic psychotherapists for 1979. Only one value, A World of Beauty, showed a statistically significant difference between men and women. In terms of rank order differences, two values, A World of Beauty( women-12, men-16) and Pleasure( women-15, men-11), reflect meaningful differences in the value system. These results indicate a very high degree of inter-gender consistency in this group. Moreover, the directions of these differences would seem to support the " traditional " view of gender roles. <p> Table 6 presents the analysis of gender differences in Instrumental Values between these populations of psychoanalytic psychotherapists for 1979. There were no gender differences which reached statistical significance. Only one value, Courageous, reflects a meaningful rank gender difference( men-8, women-3). The Instrumental values system appears to show even less heterogeneity than the Terminal values system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus seem practically indistinguishable by their respective value orientations. <p> Table 7 presents the analysis of gender differences in Terminal Values between these populations of psychoanalytic psychotherapists for 1993. Two statistically significant inter-gender differentials, Happiness( women-7.68, men-9.20) and True Friendship( women-5.66, men-7.79) appear, while True Friendship also reflects a meaningful rank differential( women-4, men-8). Thus, in the Terminal Value system, the latter value is the only one reflecting both statistical and meaningful rank order gender difference. <p> Table 8 presents the gender comparison for the 1993 Instrumental Values. There were statistically significant differences on three values : Intellectual( men-7.61, women-6.42), Logical( men-11.64, women-12.88), and Polite( men-13.98, women-14.91). Additionally, Intellectual also showed a meaningful rank order differences between genders, as it was ranked fifth by females and ninth by males. Only the difference of the value Intellectual is reflected in both methods of analysis. Once again, the dearth of differences in Instrumental Values appears to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inter-gender data on Instrumental Values across 1979 and 1993, we note that in 1979 one value, Courageous, indicated inter-gender differentials, with females ranking it higher than males. In 1993, three statistically significant values appeared : Intellectual, Logical, and Polite. The direction of these differentials is quite important from a **26;1704;TOOLONG perspective. Stereotypically, within the context of sex roles, Intellectual and Logical are seen as male typologies, while Polite is seen as female typed. Our data, however, indicate that women show higher values for Intellectual, while men show higher values for Polite. Only Logical shows the differential in the stereotypical direction. It is thus clear that the differential value structure among the population we researched is not at all consistent with sex role stereotypy. In view of the results appearing in the approximate time frame of the rise of feminist consciousness, one may question whether the stereotypy with regards to sex role is still empirically viable at our current state of social-political evolution. <p> One way of examining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socially-or personally-oriented( Braithwaite, 1994 ; Rokeach, 1973). As noted in Table 3, there are five social values and thirteen personal values as part of the Terminal Value system. The five social values are Equality, Freedom, National Security, A World at Peace, and A World of Beauty ; the remainder are personal values. Although this obviously presents a skewed distribution, it is interesting to note in Table 3 that none of the social values are in the top four positions, while two( Equality at 15 and National Security at 17) are in the bottom four. Two of the other three social values are ranked fairly low( World of Beauty -14, A World at Peace -12), while Freedom is ranked higher( at 5). <p> An additional interesting outcome of this data relates to the political orientation of the group surveyed. Two of the values, Equality and Freedom, have been demonstrated to be indicators of the political orientation of individuals and groups( Rokeach, 1973 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are : communism, socialism, conservatism, and fascism. Political orientation is determined by examining the relative ranking of the two values( see Figure 1). When Equality is high and Freedom is low, this is reflective of communism ; Equality high and Freedom high is reflective of socialism ; Freedom high and Equality low is reflective of conservatism ; and Freedom low and Equality low is reflective of fascism. In 1979, as can be seen in Figure 1, Freedom was ranked relatively high( with its rank of 5 just missing our adopted benchmark of 4) while Equality ranked low( 15), representing a conservative political position. In 1993, Freedom dropped to a rank position of 7 and Equality rose to a rank position of 12. Staying with this model, this convergence of both values( away from the low and high ends of the hierarchy) appears to reflect a shift from one of clarity( conservative) to one that seems undifferentiated. Although the relative relationship remains the same, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position( top 4 or bottom 4) ; their meaning is reduced. This shift away from resonance seems to mirror movement toward a more apolitical stance in which neither of these values( Freedom or Equality) is very important. We are surely not in a position to say what this shift means, but speculate that it may be a reflection of the zeitgeist of the times : a politically conservative era that began in the early 1980 's and continues to flourish today. <p> Upon further reflection, the relationship between these values may well identify a problem in the original conceptualization of political orientation. This group does not seem to fit the ideology continuum of communism, socialism, conservatism, and fascism ; however, the continuum itself, perhaps, is open to question. The terms used in the media and public in general are conservative or liberal, perhaps reflecting a liberal position. According to these results, liberals would be more " middle of the roaders " than reflective of any clear ideological position. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it represents an ideological stance rather than an active social or political stance. This implies that the values do not actually correspond to actual behavior since their formulation is intrinsically abstract as such( Braithwaite, 1994). Together, these issues minimize the salience of political orientation to our contemporary sample. <p> The results of this study also point in the direction of a psychoanalytic values system. The most important Terminal values are Mature Love, Self-Respect, and True Friendship, which seem to inform people 's relationship to themselves and to others. Not just love, but rather Mature Love, which emphasizes growth and development, rather than the mere feeling and experience of being in love. Self-Respect implies an ability to look and judge oneself, and True Friendship, which qualifies this important relationship in an evaluative( true) envelope. All of these appear consonant with psychoanalytic formulations of a " healthy " or idealized adult. The Terminal values ranked lowest are Salvation and National Security. These two fairly abstract, if not obtuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience. Salvation, based on a religious belief system, focuses on another life, and is clearly the least valued of the value system. National Security is also far removed from self-reflection and analysis, with its focus on the nation 's stance with regard to defense from international or domestic threat <p> The Instrumental values also reflect important ways of " being " from a psychoanalytic perspective. Loving and Honest are the two top values over the years of this study. Obedient, Clean, Polite, and Self-Controlled remain the four least important. This pattern has distinct implications. Surely this sample does not see obedience, politeness, and self control as very important. Intuitively, however, these values are generally viewed as being among the basic elements of etiquette and social grace in relating to others. Given the their devaluation in the psychoanalytic value profile, one may well have profound reservations about the quality of relationships by adherents to this value system. IMPLICATIONS AND LIMITATIONS <p> As noted above in the 1979-1993 comparison, there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of psychoanalysts, and their values hierarchies were more alike than different. These results indicate a consistency in the values of psychoanalysts over the course of a 14-year span which suggests that professional participation in this field reveals a shared value system. The personal values of the therapists in this study might therefore be viewed as reflecting the values of the institution of **27;1732;TOOLONG psychotherapy. <p> It appears, then, that psychoanalysis may constitute an institution with a unique value system into which professionals are selected and become indoctrinated( McLean, 1960 ; Michels &; Oldham, 1983). Accordingly, students may choose the profession because its value system matches their own, selection committees embody the value system of the institution and may choose candidates likely to embrace similar values, and through participation in psychotherapy training programs and various professional activities, trainees are further indoctrinated into the value system of the institution of psychoanalysis. <p> Whereas this discussion has so far suggested that individual schools of psychotherapy represent their own unique value systems( Weisskopf-Joelson, 1980), @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents a shared value system, regardless of theoretical orientation. <p> Values are becoming more and more recognized as issues in psychotherapeutic discourse. These are reflected in basic reexaminations about the role of psychotherapy and psychotherapists in our culture. Some authors go so far as to de-mystify the elusive psychotherapy interaction to the implicit vocational " guild " category where practitioners are mere agents of the dominant culture : <p> Therapists are members of particular professional guilds, and they operate at the behest of specific societal constituencies. Subtly or boldly, the solutions they propose or support broker distinct political, economic, and social arrangements.... The most pernicious stance from which therapists can operate is the belief that they are simply " neutral " participants with no ax to grind.... Like it or not, therapists are social agents. Their work advances particular cultural agendas. Therefore, the conception of the therapist as a neutral conversationalist is an impediment to frank discussions of values, preferences, lifestyles, and social ethics.( Efran, Aldorondo, &; Heffner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument, presented powerfully and definitively, might be used more productively by turning some of the statements into questions. In this age of " managed care, " there is little doubt that most therapists are less and less free agents( if they ever were free). Implicit in the above, is that therapists may hold beliefs about themselves and their work which are illusory. One aspect underlying the entire argument is the accusation that therapists have an espoused value system while, in reality, transmitting another in their practice. The results of this study are in the service of attempting to identify one of these significant dimensions -- namely, the expressed values of the psychotherapists. <p> The arguments presented above by Efran et al. may be much more acute today. However, they have been, for some time, a continuous dilemma for the therapist in determining the extent to which to identify with the client 's interests against those of society vs. attempting to transmit society 's values and myths( Wren, 1976) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by assuming that there is, ipso facto, a conflict between the values of society and those of the designated clients. If this indeed be so, the contradiction may well present an exposure of not only the values of psychotherapists, but also of societal values at large. <p> The results of this investigation seem to support the current position that there is very little in the social world which is value free. Freud 's position that the values of science are sufficient for psychotherapy is indeed a myth. The question now is not one of being value free and objective. Rather, it is an ongoing question of discovering just what the values of psychotherapy are. This study represents one small step in that direction. <p> The 1993 study attempted to address some of the limitations of the 1979 study by increasing the sample size considerably. It also was presented more anonymously, since it involved mailings rather than personal exchanges. An unexpected consequence of the different procedures is reflected in the higher return rate for the 1979 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( 26%). Does this imply that the presence of the researcher who explains the study, addresses questions, and urges and encourages greater participation is indeed influential in maximizing participation? The mailing, on the other hand, allowed distribution to a much larger potential audience ; although the percentage of return dropped considerably, the sample size was much higher. Moreover, it is difficult to speculate whether these nuances actually tapped different subsamples of the intended pool. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION <p> The question of whether theories of psychotherapy represent " perceptual houses " with their own subsequent " institutional " value system was investigated. One theoretical orientation, **27;1761;TOOLONG psychotherapy and psychoanalysis, was selected as the sample. The Rokeach Value Survey was used to determine the values and value system of the respondents. The results indicate that there is both consistency and change in a comparison of the value system of psychoanalytic psychotherapists in 1979 and 1993. However, certain values do seem to remain very stable or consistent. Of the Terminal values, Mature Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, while Salvation, National Security, and A World of Beauty are consistently ranked low. Of the Instrumental values, Loving, Honest, and Capable are consistently high, while Obedient, Clean, Polite, and Self-Controlled are consistently low. These values, therefore, seem to be a beginning of the specific identification of the values of psychoanalytic psychotherapists. It would therefore seem that the values of psychoanalysis are those one might call more personal than social ; individual( self) rather than communal( the world ; society in general). Moreover, these values appear to be fairly uniform across the profession, and are not differentiated by age and sex. <p> This study examined only one theoretical orientation and is limited to that group only. Findings indicated that there is a shared and somewhat stable value system. It is important to note that this study, while longitudinal in design, did not actually measure changes in individual values of practitioners ; rather, it is longitudinal only insofar as it measured two samples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although the institution is quite representative of the field by its prominence, it can not be stated unequivocally that the values of its members are indeed representative of their peers throughout the profession. <p> Limited as it was to psychoanalysts, the study does not answer the question about values in psychotherapy as an umbrella institution. Is this structure unique to psychoanalytic psychotherapy or does it reflect psychotherapy in general, regardless of theoretical orientation? So we tentatively conclude that there seems to be a coherent system which may represent a " perceptual house, " but whether it is a one family house or an apartment house of many theoretical orientations awaits further study. <p>
