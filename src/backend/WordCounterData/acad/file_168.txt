4025841 When preservice teacher programs are failing to adequately prepare collegiate students towards becoming thriving teachers, what can be done? After many complaints were voiced from my student body, a survey was constructed, which revealed student satisfaction levels were lowest in the following areas : 1) The variety of opportunities to teach exceptional learners, 2) Opportunities to establish rapport with students, and 3) Opportunities to teach one-on-one or small group. As a result, field experiences were redesigned to specifically address these curricular breakdowns by pairing preservice educators with cancer patients to provide meaningful tutoring experiences that would be mutually beneficial to both populations in need. The pilot program had several positive effects on the educational growth and abilities of both the preservice teachers and chronically ill patients. Not only was the program enjoyable by its participants, but it allowed the collegiate students to identify strengths and weaknesses of the child, develop/execute a remediation plan, and interact with a student for a considerable length of time. Tutoring these children/adolescents with cancer fostered a desire to support these individuals with their education and beyond, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can teach outside the confines of a school.Introduction The start of another semester had in some respects become uneventful. As a collegiate professor, I had become somewhat complacent in doing things as normal : introducing myself, speaking about what the course would entail, and asking students to describe what they would like to gain from taking this class. This particular course was centrally aimed at giving students field experiences in the junior year of their undergraduate education to prepare them for student teaching. After a brief course description, students began voicing their growing concerns and dissatisfaction with many aspects of their previous preservice teacher courses. " All we do is observe.we rarely get to teach, and when we do, it is for brief instances at a time, " stated one apprehensive individual. But what was I to do? I could not control what they had already experienced in other professors ' courses. Designing programs that prepare prospective teachers to learn from their teaching encounters beginning when they first enter the program is an alternative approach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1967 ; Hawkins, 1973 ; Nemser, 1983). Nevertheless, urgent action was needed since it was my duty to provide these preservice educators with meaningful field experiences, not tedious assignments and unfulfilled opportunities in the elementary classroom as they had already encountered. In listening to my students ' concerns, I heard many different vantage points about how their limited classroom opportunities seemed meaningless, where they sat watching when they were supposed to be giving whole-class instruction as the classroom teacher seemed to have authoritarian control of the class. Others said they conducted excessive observational studies while failing to have realistic elementary teaching practice. A few of the students even expressed their swaying desires to enter into the teaching career. This particular announcement was not startling, but its reasoning struck several nerves. Although these few did want to teach, work with children, and assist in their development, they were so displeased with their preservice teaching opportunities that they questioned whether their experiences would prepare them suitably for the immense responsibility that goes along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blatantly expressing their disgust with not having adequate preparation( e.g., teaching experiences with students). Initially, I felt criticized as being one who implemented the preservice teacher program design. How could these undergraduates know more about their needs than those who designed the existing course frameworks? Soon however, it dawned on me that no one would know better than the students themselves. They experience each course, take those opportunities, and are supposed to develop throughout their teacher education program. Smith &; Lev-Ari( 2005) found that preservice teachers most-heavily weigh practicums in terms of importance out of all aspects of teacher education ; unfortunately, the current design was not allowing my students to fulfill this necessity. Although I could not change the entire program, I could change the logistics of my particular course to better situate it towards their eminent needs. The pursuit of change commenced with designing a noteworthy semester filled with field experiences that would prove more meaningful to both the collegiate students and those elementary/middle school learners with which they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of developing future teachers if their needs are not taken into consideration when formulating one 's own curriculum? No longer would complacency be an option ; I could not accept that the program offered limited realistic opportunities to my students to leave lasting impressions on the lives of youth. Thus, it was back to the drawing board to determine what specific needs were not met by the current preservice teacher program.Theoretical Framework Numerous national and international studies have been conducted peering into preservice teacher preparation, aimed at increasing opportunities for professional development and fostering communication between the university/college and participating schools( Osterman &; Kottkamp, 2004 ; Zeichner &; Concklin, 2005). Yet, within fragmented programs, piecemeal revisions often prove to be futile( Tardif, 2001). Instead of minimally altering traditional models of teacher preparation, new prototypes involving specialized instructional experiences permit preservice educators to provide services for elementary school students that they would not otherwise receive( Tom, 1997). Learning to identify students ' needs is significant, but actually meeting those needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with students and implementing individualized instructional plans, my preservice teachers would hopefully become more seasoned in the art of teaching.Methods A survey was constructed in order to better align my course changes with exactly what my students were missing in their other preservice classes. Gathering information from each student would also ensure equal and valid representation of all 52 participatory preservice teachers, and using an electronic questionnaire would expedite the process. The survey consisted of 10 items related to their teacher preparation with the first 9 items rated using a 4-point Likert scale( poor, fair, good, excellent), whereas the final question was open-ended to reveal the students ' satisfaction levels of various aspects of the preservice teacher program, according to their first three years of undergraduate education( see Figure 1). Data analysis The total number of participants was N = 52, all of whom were third year collegiate students enrolled in the elementary education program at a major university. Averages of the responses were computed from the Likert rating of 1-4 with Poor = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Excellent = 4. Every student completed the rating of nine initial multiple choices questions, while three students refrained from commenting on the tenth question. Scores obtained from those three individuals were still used when computing averages questions 1-9, since the final question was open-ended and its absence had no effect on the other responses. Analysis of the 52 surveys revealed multiple outcomes : the three lowest-rated areas of the preservice teacher program in order were:The variety of opportunities to teach exceptional learners( 1.98) Opportunities to establish rapport with students( 2.23) Opportunities to teach one-on-one or small group( 2.54) On the other hand, the three highest rated areas of the nine survey questions were:Opportunities to observe( 3.25) Opportunities to teach whole class( 3.15) Classroom teacher awareness of your role( 3.10) Before further analysis was conducted on these nine questions, results of the tenth question were tabulated. Although there were varying answers as should be expected from open-ended questions, specific trends became apparent. The open-ended question, " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requests to provide the collegiate students with meaningful teaching experiences where they could be of actual assistance to learners. One student noted : I really feel like we have n't had the chance to build rapport with the students. We have n't been given any time to really get to know them. I feel like we are thrown in and must immediately start teaching without having a day or two to just spend getting to know them. I feel that if I was given that time, then I would have felt a little bit more comfortable teaching for the first time. Another student commented, " The program should allow more one-on-one opportunities in order for the student to receive the maximum amount of help possible. " Clearly, my students understood that developing relationships with the student body was a significant aspect of teacherhood ; yet, their university experiences did not allow for these interactions to flourish. When questioned in class about their previous experiences with exceptional learners, numerous students exclaimed, " We conducted many observations of special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach the students. " The university 's goals were for students to be enriched in a variety of settings acting as and learning from classroom teachers. In actuality, the university was failing to reach this benchmark. Whether the difficulty lied in collaboration between the entire preservice teacher faculty or within the structural foundations of the courses, the problem was real and timely change was compulsory. Upon further reviewing student responses to the open-ended questions, additional light was shed on those areas of the program deemed effective, such as giving opportunities to observe and teach in a whole-class setting, as well as the classroom teacher 's awareness of the preservice teachers ' role in the classroom. Although these were identified as the three highest-rated of the nine areas addressed in the Preservice Satisfaction Rating Survey, comments from the open-ended responses more clearly developed the reasoning behind their rating. For instance, one student said, " I would really like to see preservice teachers be able to go into the schools and tutor more. I went to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once did I really tutor students. " Indeed, many courses did allot for observational studies, but seemingly failed to link these towards hands-on teaching experiences. Yes, teaching without observation would be foolish, but observation without teaching is just as ineffective within any preservice teacher program.Purpose of the Study Clearly, significant change was necessary within the entire preservice teacher program, but the more eminent issue was the need for my course to be restructured immediately so that 52 collegiate students would be prepared for student teaching the following semester ; this was not a simple task. Where would I find a population of children with educational needs, who could use the one-on-one tutoring assistance of my students, and who were accessible to my student body? After deliberating about this predicament, one possibility came to mind. It lied deep within my own previous educational experiences, many of which I had hoped to forget. In adolescence, I faced numerous school-related dilemmas due to a personal illness--one that changed my life forever. At the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NHL) and instantaneously, my future was unknown. Life, including becoming educated, was exceedingly difficult. Were going to school and learning important anymore when one 's life is being challenged? High doses of chemotherapy can and did permanent damage to my strength and mental acuity. Brain damage and exhaustion were just two of the symptoms, not to mention the nausea and agonizing pain. According to Armstrong, a professor of pediatrics and director of the Mailman Center for Child Development at the University of Miami School of Medicine, these educational dilemmas are prevalent for many chronically ill children while on treatment. He states : The demands of treatment often lead parents, physicians, teachers, and other adults to decide that education is secondary, something to be addressed when things are better. The consequence of this approach is that learning needs are neglected, leaving children at a disadvantage when treatment is finished.( p. 16) Indeed, my own bout with cancer disallowed me from continuing to receive standardized schooling, so instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public education. This time in my life was indeed full of difficulty, but many other patients at the hospital receiving the same drugs were not affected in the same fashion. The logistics behind educational planning for all chronically ill children is tremendously difficult. The United States Department of Health and Human Services( 2003) co-authored a special report entitled, " Students with Chronic Illnesses : Guidance for Families, Schools, and Students. " One of the prominent issues discussed in the manuscript is encouraging " schools to develop and implement condition-specific and individualized protocols " for these students( p. 131). Indeed, educational services beyond those provided through state agencies and local schools could dearly benefit these most-deserving children. This served as the purpose behind selecting pediatric cancer patients as a suitable population for tutoring. Remembering my days as a senior in high school, I was home-schooled for the one remaining required course : English IV. Single-handedly, my new teacher provided me with personalized assistance with which I had dreamed. When I needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I needed help with literary analysis, I could count on his support. He allowed me to graduate from high school, restoring my educational aspirations. Perhaps, my collegiate students could also leave a lasting impression on children who struggle to attain health and educational prosperity. How else could my students become more personally satisfied, develop rapport and relationships with students, and see the difference teachers can make? Framework Because of the lack of standardization across states and public programs, Szilagyi( 2003) stressed that while children 's healthcare needs may be met, other aspects of ongoing care go by the wayside. Katz( 2003) furthered that while " maintaining a consistent educational program can be a real challenge.. Hospital volunteers may also help with educational support during brief hospital stays. " In an effort to fill voids within the preservice program at the university with which I worked while simultaneously providing a much-needed service to ill children and teenagers, field experiences were directed towards tutoring cancer patients. To gain access to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volunteer workshop, required by the hospital, where they were trained and given tuberculosis shots, if they had not already been vaccinated within the last 10 years. These preliminary measures were necessary since the tutoring sessions would be taking place at the hospital. Patient families were identified, informed, given voluntary permission forms, and allowed to voice any concerns prior to giving consent for tutoring. Throughout the entire process, I served as a liaison between the participatory patient families and the university 's preservice teachers. Patients ' schedules were given priority when arranging meeting times as my collegiate students could accommodate the youth 's biweekly hospital visits. For instance, if the child came on Wednesdays for blood work and Thursdays for chemotherapy, one of these days was chosen by the preservice teacher for tutoring. In all, the individualized tutoring sessions were geared to the student 's particular needs, according to subject areas. The meetings were conducted within a 12-week timeframe on location at a clinic affiliated with a large pediatric cancer research hospital. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healing but also during the process of granting my students complete access to tutor **27;1009;TOOLONG During the 12 weeks of field experience, students also regularly participated in whole-class and small-group discussions with their classmates regarding their tutoring sessions. Enabling students to communicate about their ongoing tutoring sessions, both their successes and their struggles, was productive in the sense that collaboration amongst themselves brought forth new ideas( McDermott, Gormley, Rothernberg, &; Hammer, 1995). Cooperation amongst students and their tutees was another central factor towards a better integrated and a more coherent program. To clearly detail the results of this pilot program, a post-tutoring survey was issued to all 52 participating preservice teachers. Questions were derived from the initial survey, but modified to determine student satisfaction levels of this particular set of field experiences( Figure 2). Post-tutoring surveys depicted that the implemented changes had an overall positive effect on their fulfillment of field experiences, as the average rating increased from 2.69 to 3.85 on the 4-point Likert scale. The three areas that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The variety of opportunities to teach exceptional learners ; 2) Opportunities to establish rapport with students ; and 3) Opportunities to teach one-on-one or small group, were targeted by the curricular changes. In turn, those three categories as well as most others in the survey were rated higher on average than before tutoring individual children with special needs. As could be expected, the lowest-rated question, receiving an average score of 3.27, dealt with the patients ' availability for tutoring. However, these instances were expected as the tutoring sessions were planned for the 12-week period. Preservice teachers had ample opportunities to complete their required eight sessions with their particular pediatric cancer patient. In two instances, patient families decided to withdraw from the program for personal reasons and therefore, those preservice tutors were assigned other patients for continuance with their tutoring services. An analysis of the open-ended question followed which led the investigator to make several determinations. Foremost, working one-on-one with a student population that was in need led to a dramatic increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the process of working closely with those students on a weekly basis, preservice teachers enjoyed developing relationships with children/adolescents, and students gained a renewed sense of their professional purpose. One student stated, " I wish that we would have had this opportunity sooner in the program, so that we could go from working one-on-one to small groups to whole class. " Countless preservice educators commented on how truly inspirational the tutoring sessions were : " My child 's face lit up every time I walked in to see him, " " I did n't want to leave because she was doing so well, " and " I hope that others can experience working with children at the hospital. " These voices were coming from the same group of students complaining so heavily at the first of the semester. Their experiences tutoring children led them to develop new-found attitudes about the preservice program, just as McCabe and Miller( 2003) noted in their own investigation.Conclusion Many of my undergraduate students were not given adequate opportunities to experience the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredible patients ranging in age from 7 to 17 were not sufficiently provided with educational assistance. Two populations of students had particular needs that were simultaneously addressed by positioning the groups to benefit from each other. Those one-on-one tutoring sessions between the collegiate preservice teachers and the pediatric cancer patients had positive effects on both participating parties, resulting in a symbiotic relationship. Fulfilling the patients ' desire for individualized attention and educational support served an astonishing purpose in the lives and development of truly unique perspectives within this group of preservice educators, which will inevitably prepare them for teaching children with varying needs and considerations. Tutoring cancer patients, as one of my students commented, " Allowed us to make a difference unlike any other opportunity we have ever had. These sick children love us coming every week. " It was evident throughout the semester that my students were much more pleased with their ability to have a positive effect on their tutees. In an atmosphere such as a hospital clinic, where it is not all fun and games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seeing what the patients had to go through each week just to survive contributed to the seriousness with which my students committed to providing these children/adolescents with meaningful learning opportunities. Not only was the program enjoyable by most of the participants, but it allowed the collegiate students to identify strengths and weaknesses of the child, develop/execute a remediation plan, and interact with a student for a considerable length of time. Tutoring these children/adolescents with cancer fostered a desire to support these individuals with their education and beyond. Moreover, it put a name to childhood cancer. What once was something completely foreign to my students was right in front of them- a living, breathing person who was battling for his or her life and required assistance from many others in terms of physical, emotional, and educational support. Learning much more than how to effectively plan and carry out tutoring sessions, my students gained a perspective on life and its preciousness that could not have been possible without experiencing how one can teach outside the confines of a school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide students additional experiences that foster a relationship between teaching and learning in environments that are conducive to educational growth. Inevitably, they will not come without difficulties, but the rewards are like no other.Figure 1.
