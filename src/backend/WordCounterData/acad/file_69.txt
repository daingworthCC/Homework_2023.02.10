4010541 Abstract : Temperament provides clinicians with a framework for appreciating and supporting the individual differences of children while prompting ways to handle skillfully their behavior. The science of temperament and its application also assists clinicians in exploring and improving the transactional patterns that occur between children and their environment at school and within their families. This article explores the science and art of temperament-based intervention and offers guidelines for practice and research. <p> The variety of individual responses that children demonstrate in response to treatments or techniques provides convincing clinical evidence that one way of intervening is not equally effective for every child. Many clinicians, who have observed in their practice the individual response patterns of children, find temperament theory a compelling conceptualization on which to interpret these variations. Temperament theory asserts that individuals have particular behavioral styles that they demonstrate across a variety of settings and circumstances, especially those that involve stress( McClowry, 1992). The purpose of this article is to review the art and science of using the construct of temperament as the basis for intervention. The conceptualization supporting the clinical application of temperament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinicians in planning their interventions. Finally, some of the challenges encountered by clinicians and researchers who conduct temperament-based intervention are explored. The Science and Art of Temperament-Based Interventions <p> Temperament is intuitively appealing to clinicians because it lends itself toward the development of innovative individualized interventions with children that can be recommended to parents and other caregivers such as teachers and other professionals. Conducting temperament-based intervention, however, demands a marriage of science and clinical art. Empirical investigations of the construct form the scientific foundation. Temperament studies range from sophisticated randomized clinical trials testing the effectiveness of a temperament-based interventions, to descriptive observational research conducted in laboratories, to investigations into the physiological factors which underscore the biology of temperament. <p> Developing theory-based interventions, however, requires more than understanding the scientific foundation. Applying the results of research studies to real-life situations is an art blending creativity, intuition, and clinical expertise. Complex studies and theoretical constructs must be synthesized and then presented so that they are understandable and applicable to particular clients. Manageable outcomes must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieved also should occur. <p> Clinical creativity, however, should be tempered with scientific restraint. Bates( 1989) cautioned clinicians that many temperament self-report questionnaires have not received adequate development to be used as a clinical screening device. Likewise, the factors that contribute toward various child outcomes are still under investigation. But, clinicians can not wait until basic researchers have resolved all of the conceptual issues that plague the temperament field. Pressing clinical questions arise daily demanding immediate attention and resolution. An alternative iterative approach is proposed. Temperament theory, as it currently exists, should be applied first by clinicians in their practice, then tested through research. The results are likely to inform theory, improve clinical practice, and prompt further research. <p> Interest in the clinical application of temperament is conspicuous in the literature. More than half of the temperament publications address clinically related issues( Bates, 1989). Suggestions for integrating temperament into practice have existed for decades and were embedded in the clinical work of psychiatrists Chess and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NYLS)( Thomas, Chess, Birch, Hertzig, &; Korn, 1963). In recent years, clinicians from a variety of disciplines have published examples of their temperament-based interventions. Kurcinka( 1991), an educator, framed child temperament in a way that helps parents recognize the strengths of their children. She then offered practical suggestions for managing common behavioral problems. Turecki( Turecki &; Tonner, 1985), a psychiatrist, used temperament to assist parents who perceive their children as difficult to become more competent in managing their behavior. Carey( Carey &; Jablow, 1997), a pediatrician, devoted many years to advising parents and professionals about how temperament is related to health and illness. He also has coedited two books with his psychologist colleague, McDevitt,( Carey &; McDevitt, 1989, 1994), which present their strategies and those of other expert clinicians for the application of temperament constructs in educational and community settings. Melvin and McClowry( 1995) coedited a journal issue which presented interventions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those challenged by illness and disabilities. <p> Although a burgeoning interest in the clinical application of temperament exists, few studies have examined the effectiveness of temperament-based intervention. This critique of the literature is ironic given the history of temperament research. Temperament-based guidance about behavioral issues was provided to the participants of the NYLS( Chess &; Thomas, 1996). Sixty-six percent of the families responded positively to the guidance. Parents whose school-age children had temperaments that were low in task persistence were presented the most challenging scenarios for improvement in the upper-middle class families who participated in the study. <p> For more than 10 years -- as part of their primary care services -- Kaiser Permanente HMO in Northern California has incorporated a temperament educational program for their client-members( Rosen, Cameron, &; Rice, 1996). Beginning when a child is 4 months old, parents can receive written materials describing their child 's temperament with related anticipatory guidance. Additional support is offered to parents whose child is exhibiting temperament-related behavioral problems. The cost effectiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are high in activity and negative mood. Parents of such infants who received the educational materials versus those in a control group initiated fewer visits to their primary care provider. Recently, the Kaiser group has expanded their educational program beyond Northern California. They also have produced videotapes and now provide Internet access to their information. 1 <p> Another innovative program, Temperament Talk, comes from the Center for Human Development in rural LaGrande, Oregon( B. Zukin, personal communication, January 20, 1998). After screening by a mental health professional to assure that the participants are not addressing psychiatric problems, temperament-based parental guidance is delivered in weekly sessions by trained parents. Ninety-six percent of the parents who completed the program reported an improvement in their child 's behavior. All of the parents found the weekly guidance to be helpful. <p> Formalized clinical trials are just beginning. Sheeber and Johnson( 1994) compared 21 mothers who received a 9-week temperament-focused parent training program based upon Turecki and Tonner( 1985) with 19 in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, middle-class mothers of 3- to 5-year-old children, who, based on an initial assessment, exhibited minor behavioral problems. After the intervention and at a two-month follow-up, the experimental mothers demonstrated increased satisfaction in their parent-child relationships, higher perceived parental competence, and improved affect. Fewer child behavior problems and disruptions in family life-style also were reported. <p> Funded by the National Institute of Nursing Research, Melvin( 1995) has recently completed a randomized clinical trial testing the effectiveness of TIPS, Temperament Intervention for Parents. 2 More than 300 mostly middle-class parents of preschoolers participated in the study. Families were randomly assigned to three groups : control, information only, and a nurse intervention group in which the parents received four to six individualized sessions. During the intervention, the nurses taught the parents basic temperament concepts and then guided them in applying the material to their specific parent-child interactional patterns. Handouts relevant to the child 's temperament reinforced the management strategies that were discussed with the parents who were expected to practice the techniques between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Obviously, more empirical investigations are needed to determine the effectiveness of temperament-based intervention. Still, the limited number of existing investigations need not dissuade clinicians from applying the theory in their practice. By adapting a broader conceptual perspective, clinicians will find a rigorous scientific foundation on which to base their interventions. Conceptualization Supporting Intervention <p> The conceptualization for temperament-based intervention is derived from three bodies of literature that explain child behavior from different perspectives : temperament, parenting, and the school environment. While temperament theory emphasizes the contribution of children to their social environment, the parenting literature focuses on parental, particularly maternal, effects upon the child. The school environment literature emphasizes the role of teachers and other caregivers who have the potential to influence child development. Combined, these literatures and the methods of intervention derived from them provide a powerful conceptualization for temperament-based intervention aimed at reducing child behavior problems while simultaneously fostering prosocial skills and diminishing parental and other caregiver distress. <p> As discussed, temperament theory asserts that children have a particular behavioral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social environment. Biological factors strongly influence the expression of temperament. Physiological studies have demonstrated that temperament is a self-organizing system that serves as a filter to regulate attention and behavior which is further strengthened through the progressive sculpting of neural networks( Derryberry &; Reed, 1994). Consequently, the child whose temperament is high in negative reactivity is likely to attend to negative information about him- or herself and about others. <p> But within the temperament perspective, the environment also plays an active part. Many children 's behavioral problems, according to temperament theory, could be averted if the environment provides goodness-of-fit, which is achieved when demands, expectations, and opportunities are consonant with the child 's temperament( Chess &; Thomas, 1984). Parents and other caregivers of children with challenging temperaments are often relieved to learn that some children require considerably more effort to rear than others. Once this insight is achieved, self-blame is reduced and caregivers can redirect their energies to resolving the conflict the child has with his or her social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @). <p> While the emphasis in the temperament literature is on the child 's contribution to his or her own development, the focus switches in the parenting literature to the parents themselves. An assortment of labels and configurations are evident in the parenting literature to identify two major conceptual components( Maccoby &; Martin, 1983). In most cases, the labels can be categorized as an affective or an instrumental component, described respectively as warmth and control( Halverson &; Wampler, 1997 ; Maccoby &; Martin, 1983). Warmth is the acceptance or responsiveness vs. the rejection that parents relay to their children. Control refers to the demands that parents exert on their children vs. the autonomy that they encourage. <p> The significance of discipline, or how parents exert their authority, is critical. Parental inconsistency is a major factor in the development of children 's conduct disorders( Brand, Crouse, &; Hanehom, 1990). Ineffective parental discipline is counterproductive. Patterson( 1982) and Patterson &; Reid( 1970) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibited antisocial behavior. Instead of ignoring minor coercive episodes or engaging in a directed disciplinary action, the mothers in such families behaved ineptly by nagging or irritably scolding which often escalated the child 's disruptive behavior. Likewise, Baden and Howe( 1992) found that parents of conduct-disordered children regarded their children 's misbehavior as intentional and beyond parental control. <p> Yet, even the most effective parents are challenged because various parenting styles have differential effects, depending on the child 's developmental stage and temperament( Bugental &; Shennum, 1984 ; Cameron, 1978 ; Davies, McMahon, Flessati, &; Tiedemann, 1984). As early as toddlerhood, effective parental control shifts from physical to verbal modalities. Parental control involves more negotiation as the child 's language becomes more sophisticated( Kuczynski, Kochanska, Radke-Yarrow, &; Girnius-Brown, 1987). Effective parents alter their directives as children get older to foster their independence( Gralinski &; Kopp, 1993). Conversely, parents who use aversive, vague, and physical instructions with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dumas &; Lechowicz, 1989). <p> Parenting is further complicated by variations in children 's temperament. Temperament studies explain why some siblings within a family develop behavioral problems while others do not. Children with particular temperament characteristics may be at risk for developing behavioral problems. High negative reactivity( Brody, Stoneman, &; Burke, 1987, 1988 ; Chess &; Thomas, 1984 ; Kashani, Ezpeleta, Dandoy, Doi, &; Reid, 1991 ; Maziade et al., 1990 ; McClowry et al., 1994 ; Pullis, 1985 ; Terestman, 1980), high activity level( Brody et al., 1988 ; Rende &; Plomin, 1992), low approach( Rende &; Plomin, 1992), and low task persistence( McClowry et al., 1994 ; Prior, Sanson, &; Oberklaid, 1989 ; Pullis, 1985) have been associated with behavioral problems. Conversely, low activity level, high approach, and high task persistence have been associated with positive self-perception( Klein, 1992). In another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resiliency and other competencies( Smith &; Prior, 1995). <p> The interactive effects of parenting styles with various child temperaments are just beginning to be identified( Rothbart &; Bates, 1998). Again, parental warmth and control was shown to influence children 's development. Mothers who perceived their children as having difficult temperaments compared to those who viewed their children as easy were more directive and disapproving of them during problem-solving activities( Gauvain &; Fagot, 1995). Greater externalizing behavior developed among children whose temperament was resistant to control when their mothers were not restrictive than when they were( Bates, Pettit, Dodge, &; Ridge, in press). Moreover, gentle, rather than forceful control, by mothers of fearful children supported their development of conscience( Kochanska, 1991). <p> Parents can be taught new ways of interacting with their children. Several parenting programs have shown effectiveness in reducing children 's behavioral problems, particularly for those who are conduct-disordered( Moreland, Schwebel, Beck, &; Wells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, 1974 ; Webster-Stratton, Hollinsworth, &; Kolpacoff, 1989). But, often these programs present generic child management techniques as if they were applicable to all children. From a temperament perspective, various management strategies may not be optimal for all children. For example, time-out is generally regarded as an effective disciplinary tactic. For the child who is low in task persistence, however, time-out may reinforce his or her tendency to abandon activities midstream when they become difficult. Such a child may learn to act out when frustrated to get rewarded with a time-out from an activity that requires his or her concentration to be completed. A temperament-based strategy for a child who is low in task persistence is to have the adult caregiver structure the assigned task in appropriately small steps. The child should then receive positive reinforcement for making progress toward the completion of the assignment. <p> In a similar manner, a child whose temperament is high in negative reactivity has a tendency to react to even minor stressors in an intensely negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances is ineffective and likely to be counterproductive, causing the child to demonstrate even more vocal or physical distress. A temperament-based strategy is to selectively ignore the child 's initial negative comments or to respond in a neutral fashion while assisting the child to find more acceptable ways to deal with his or her distress. Children who are high in negative reactivity can learn to modulate their tone of voice and to discern under which circumstances they should express displeasure and when they should demonstrate greater restraint. <p> While temperament-based intervention is intended to relay acceptance to the child, the strategies that parents and other caregivers use often encourage the child to accept a challenge that can foster his or her development. For example, a mother who has a child who is cautious and slow to warm up may tell the child that although meeting new children at a birthday party may initially be uncomfortable, she is sure that the discomfort will only last a few minutes. To ease the child into the situation, the mother may offer to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names of children that he or she already knows. Conversely, a father whose child has a temperament that is social and eager to try new experiences will adopt other strategies. He will want to explain the importance of safety while still acknowledging to the child that his or her friendly nature is a positive and valued attribute. <p> Parents are not the only ones who influence children. The conceptualization for temperament-based intervention also acknowledges the potential positive contribution of teachers and other nonfamilial caregivers within the school environment. Adverse sociofamilial factors contribute toward the vulnerability of many children, compromising their personal and interpersonal development and academic achievement( Institute of Medicine IOM, 1994). But, the involvement of effective, caring adults enhances the resiliency of children, thereby, reducing the likelihood of their developing serious behavioral disorders( Werner &; Smith, 1992). <p> An orderly school environment is critical, but often difficult to maintain. Teachers report discipline problems in public schools as their major concern, second only to student drug use( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the model most frequently used to correct repetitive and disruptive student behaviors. Traditionally, most behavioral consultation has been based on behavior modification programs designed for a specific disruptive student( Kazdin, 1994 ; Kratochwill, Elliott, &; Rotto, 1990). Typically, the program is developed by a consultant who instructs the teacher to implement the plan to improve the child 's behavior. A metaanalysis of such programs demonstrates that they have moderate effectiveness in changing teacher behavior and attitudes, but lesser effectiveness on changing the behavior of the targeted children( Batts, 1988). Teacher directed behavioral interventions, however, which combine theory, demonstration, practice, and feedback are more effective than those that provide information only( Bennett, 1988). <p> Two trends are changing the disciplinary approaches used in schools. Behavioral consultants have been challenged to broaden their approach by engaging parents, teachers, and other caregivers in their intervention so that the child is viewed not in isolation but within the systems in which he or she interacts( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A less directed approach is encouraged so that all of the child 's caregivers are viewed not as passive recipients of a professional 's advice, but active participants in the planning. <p> A second trend engages clinicians in schools in another systems approach. Rather than focusing on just problem children, preventive approaches are emerging. Clinicians work together to develop strategies that create a more positive social environment which fosters responsible student behavior( Lewis, 1997). Temperament-Based Interventions <p> Once clinicians learn about temperament, they are likely to see how it applies to many of the situations that arise with school-age children. Clinicians may then wish to incorporate their knowledge of temperament concepts when giving guidance to parents and other caregivers. A more successful result is likely to occur if the parent and/or other caregivers are engaged in planning and implementing a temperament-based intervention. <p> In general, several steps are involved in temperament-based intervention. First, the clinician must determine if temperament is related to the identified concerns. If it is, the clinician can teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the child 's behavior. Strategies to enhance child management and improve goodness-of-fit can then be collaboratively developed. Follow-up will be necessary to see whether the strategies have been adequately applied and to ascertain their effectiveness. Adjustments may be necessary if the intervention has not been successful. <p> Effective temperament-based interventions can result in a number of positive outcomes. If successful, caregivers will become more knowledgeable about child temperament and how it influences behavior. They also will become more deliberate, skillful, and positive in their interactions with their children. As a result, the children will exhibit fewer behavioral problems. The intervention also will impact on the caregivers. By better appreciating the uniqueness of each child, caregivers may experience more pleasure in their roles. Consequently, caregiver distress regarding child temperament and normative developmental issues will diminish. Likewise, as caregivers relay greater warmth, yet become more consistent and effective in their disciplinary strategies, the self-esteem of the children should be enhanced. Other positive child outcomes may include an enhancement of empathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Bates, 1998). <p> Multiple types of temperament interventions are possible. The classification presented in this article is not intended to be hierarchical, but to provide clinicians with an operating schema to use when planning their own interventions and when evaluating their effectiveness. <p> But, first, a distinction needs to be made between interventions that are strictly educational and those that engage the participants interactively in implementing the content. In an educational intervention, parents and/or caregivers are provided with temperament content that they are then expected to apply independently. In an interactive program, a professional guides parents or other caregivers in systematically implementing the information by providing practice exercises, an opportunity to report the results and to make adjustments in the child management strategies. Both educational and interactive interventions activities can be delivered individually or within groups. In both cases, the targeted participants must be considered when designing the intervention. Classifications of Temperament-Based Intervention Programs <p> Three classifications of temperament-based intervention programs are possible : promotion, prevention, and treatment. Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their variations in focus and expected outcomes, recommended screening and referral procedures, required educational preparation of the providers, and suggested format including medium of delivery, number of sessions, and use of boosters, which are additional sessions used to reinforce the material once the formal program has ended. <p> Promotion. The purpose of promotion programs is to enhance competence, self-esteem, and sense of well-being( IOM, 1994). A temperament-based promotion program is intended for parents who are not in crisis regarding their parental role, but who are eager to promote their children 's development and to strengthen family harmony. <p> Prior to admission into a temperament-based promotion program, a screening of the child and the family system should be conducted. Appropriate child-related concerns for this type of intervention include issues related to temperament, poorness of fit, minor behavioral problems, or developmental concerns. More serious family problems, such as maternal depression or domestic violence, if identified during the prescreening or during the course of the intervention, should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the parent(s) to determine whether adjunctive therapy is appropriate or whether the family should be removed from the intervention to first deal with their more serious problems. <p> If an adequate pre-screening is conducted to assure that the participants are appropriate for a promotion program, temperament advisors can deliver the intervention to parents. The educational preparation of the advisors should be, at a minimum, a bachelor 's degree. The temperament advisors need to be trained in the delivery of the intervention and should receive ongoing supervision by someone who has a professional advanced degree and licensure. <p> Temperament-based promotion programs can be delivered individually or in groups. Parents, typically, meet with a temperament advisor for 1 to 6 sessions. The child 's temperament is described and an assessment of goodness-of-fit is made. Specific solutions to problems resulting from a poor fit are developed. Parents are encouraged to use the advice and discuss the results in subsequent sessions, which continue until a better fit and more manageable behavior is achieved. <p> As an alternative approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group format. The advantage to group sessions is the support parents gain from each other as well as from the temperament advisor who serves as the facilitator. The disadvantage of a group format is that the content is less individualized. On the other hand, because the information is more general, parents learn to apply the material not only to their targeted child 's current problems, but to those that may emerge in the future. Such generalizability may be beneficial for addressing other relationships as well. <p> Another consideration is the cost of the chosen format. While individual sessions are likely to require less time from the parents, group sessions may be more cost effective because 10 to 12 parents can be facilitated at one time by the temperament advisor. Clinicians using the group format will need to determine how many sessions are necessary to relay the content. Six 2-hour weekly sessions are recommended. Parents can then practice the skills presented at home between sessions because it is unlikely that changes in family interactions will be maintained without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes with the passage of time, class reunions can be scheduled to review content and to help parents address ever emerging child issues. Such booster sessions are appropriate for parents who received intervention individually or in a group format. <p> Prevention. Temperament-based preventive intervention is intended for children who are at risk for developing mental health disorders. To participate in a prevention program, the child and his or her parents should not have psychological problems which are at a DSM-IV diagnosable level. Instead, the purpose of preventive intervention is to reduce the occurrences of mental health disorders by decreasing risk factors and increasing protective ones( IOM, 1994). A number of sociofamilial factors contribute toward the development of child mental disorders, particularly conduct disorders. The risk of conduct disorders, in fact, increases proportionately when multiple aversive situations are experienced( IOM, 1994). Two factors, poverty( Hawkins, Catalano, &; Miller, 1992) and living in a community with a high crime level( Sampson, 1985), @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outcomes of a temperament-based prevention intervention are nearly the same as a promotion one, the participants and level of intensity differs. Because the participants of a prevention program are drawn from an at-risk population, greater life distress should be expected and will require a more intensive intervention. A temperament-based prevention intervention program is appropriately intended for parents whose children are at risk for developing conduct disorders or depression. The parents, themselves, also are at risk for depression and/or anxiety due to life stressors. <p> Lessons learned from the parenting literature provide direction for temperament-based preventive intervention. The effectiveness of parenting programs for children who are at risk for developing conduct disorders is compromised when multiple family problems exist as often happens with disadvantaged families( Webster-Stratton, 1994). Consequently, some parenting programs have added additional sessions to address other family deficits such as ineffective communication or ways to improve problem solving( Webster-Stratton, 1994). Another approach is to direct intervention not just at the parents but to other caregivers, such as teachers, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children 's socialization( Bloomquist, August, &; Ostrander, 1991 ; Weissberg, Caplan, &; Bennetto, 1988). <p> To handle the more complex needs of at-risk populations, temperament-based preventive intervention should involve parallel programs for parents and the children 's teachers or child care providers to assure that consistent management strategies are used. The children also should be engaged. They can be taught to use temperament-related principles in their interactions with their peers, family members, and teachers-caregivers. <p> The timing of temperament-based prevention programs is critical for maximizing their effectiveness. The optimal time is before deviant behaviors are established. Because aggressive behavior crystallizes by 8 years of age( Huesmann, Eron, Lefkowitz, &; Walder, 1984), early intervention during the preschool years is the ideal. Yet, many parents of at-risk children do not recognize their child 's problems until after he or she has begun school. The early school-age years, then, become critical ones for halting the progression of child behavior problems. Unless adults intervene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to higher levels of pathology and may lead to serious mental health problems( Bates, 1989 ; Maziade et al., 1990). The vast majority of adults with serious antisocial behavior exhibited a conduct disorder during the school-age years( Patterson, DeBaryshe, &; Ramsey, 1989). Likewise, depression during middle childhood has been related to chronic depression later in life( Kovacs, Feinberg, Crouse-Novak, Paulauskos, &; Finkelstein, 1984). <p> Screening for prevention intervention should be more formalized than for promotion programs. In addition to observing the child and interviewing the parents, standardized instruments can aid the clinician in determining that while the family is at risk, identified problems are not at a diagnosable level. To formally assess the child, the Child Behavior Checklist( CBCL ; Achenbach &; Edelbrock, 1983) or the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children( DISC-IV ; Schwab-Stone et al., 1996) can be used. The most relevant module for the DISC-IV is the Disruptive Disorder which includes Attention-Deficit/ Hyperactivity, Oppositional Disorder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be evaluated. Parental depression can be assessed on the Brief Symptom Inventory( BSI) which is a 53-item self-report of psychological symptomology( Derogatis, 1993) or the Beck Depression Inventory( Beck, Steer, &; Garbin, 1988). Suicidal ideation or intent requires immediate treatment from a mental health professional. <p> Facilitators who deliver temperament-based preventive intervention will need adequate clinical skills to handle the more complex concurrent family situations which affect the child 's behavior and which influence parental distress. The clinical training of the facilitator should be at least a master 's degree in a social service field. Backup by a licensed professional is critical for supervision as well as for referral if family problems intensify during the course of intervention. As with promotion programs, a licensed mental health therapist should determine in such cases whether adjunctive therapy is appropriate or whether the family should first concentrate on their more pressing problems. <p> Temperament-based prevention programs can be delivered individually or in groups. The educational materials, however, should be geared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the language used and the medium of delivery is appropriate for the intended audience. Reading materials should be used only to reinforce points made in discussion or through videotapes, not to relay new content. <p> For successful intervention to occur, a comprehensive intervention is necessary and will be time-intensive. Parallel programs for parents and teachers should consist of 10 weekly 2-hour sessions. Ten 1-hour weekly sessions for the children is appropriate. A universal classroom intervention is recommended so that targeted children and their peers are engaged in the same interpersonal skill building and problem solving activities. <p> Six or eight participants are recommended in both the parent and teacher programs to allow all participants ample time for discussion. But because attrition is likely to occur, over enrollment is appropriate. Boosters are critical to maintain the skills learned during the intervention. <p> The supportive nature of group intervention may provide an additional positive outcome for at-risk parents. The successful mastery of the complex concepts included in a temperament-based intervention may provide parents with the incentive to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, or community. <p> Treatment. Treatment is intended for child or parental problems which meet or are close to meeting a DSM-IV( American Psychiatric Association, 1994) diagnosis( IOM, 1994). Before recommending temperament-based treatment, a licensed diagnostician should first evaluate the child and/or parents. Not all behavioral disturbances are related to child temperament. Some disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and manic-depression are unrelated and, thus, are inappropriate for temperament-based treatment( Chess &; Thomas, 1996). <p> Temperament-based treatment is appropriate for diagnoses( i.e., conduct disorder, adjustment disorder, brain damage or child or parental depression) when the identified symptoms are influenced or intensified by temperament related issues. The clinician can select between two approaches for temperament-based treatment( Chess &; Thomas, 1996). One approach is for therapy to be directed first at reducing the symptoms related to the diagnosis. Only when the symptoms are under control does the clinician introduce strategies to deal with the temperament related issues. <p> A different approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related to the diagnosis contribute to the difficulties that the parent is having in handling the child or that the child is exhibiting in response to the parental pathology. In such cases, the clinician can first concentrate on offering practical suggestions to change the specific behaviors that the parent exhibits that contribute to maladaptive behavior in the child. Once the parent has corrected her or his mismanagement or unhealthy alliance with the child, the underlying intrapsychic issues should be explored. <p> The severity of the psychological problems of patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis who receive temperament-based intervention dictates that licensed mental health therapists should deliver the treatment. The intensity and individualized nature of the problems also necessitates that most temperament-based treatment should be delivered in individual sessions. The length of treatment will vary with the presenting problems. Followup is recommended after treatment. INSIGHTS <p> An example of a temperament-based intervention is INSIGHTS, a prevention program for parents, teachers, and their disadvantaged minority, inner-city, school-age children. The effectiveness of INSIGHTS is being tested in a five-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 <p> The principles described in this article for temperament-based preventive intervention were used to design INSIGHTS. To qualify for the program, potential participants are screened using standardized instruments to assure that their level of distress is not at a DSM-IV diagnosable level. Then, master 's degree-level facilitators, under the direction of licensed mental health care clinicians, conduct INSIGHTS as a comprehensive program with three integrated components : a parenting program, a parallel one for teachers, and a universal classroom program for first and second grade children. Parents and teachers of the targeted children receive intervention in 10 separate weekly 2-hour sessions. Delivered to groups of 6 to 8 parents or teachers, the sessions include didactic content, videotaped vignettes, role-playing, discussion, and assignments. The children are engaged in their own program. Puppets and other drama therapy techniques relay related concepts to the targeted children and their classmates in their classrooms. Three booster sessions occur during the subsequent six months. Challenges for the Future of Temperament-Based Intervention <p> An assessment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first acknowledging the creative clinicians who have been generous in disseminating their strategies, so that they can serve as launching points for others. Still, temperament-based intervention will not achieve credibility unless empirical investigations document its efficacy. Before positive outcomes can be substantiated, several challenges must be faced by clinicians and researchers alike as they plan their interventions. <p> Surely expert clinicians will continue to creatively apply the art of temperament intervention into their practice. A knowledge of the scientific foundation will assist them in developing innovative strategies. Research on temperament that can further assist clinicians is constantly being generated. Clinicians need to carefully critique research studies, sifting through to find those that are rigorous and applicable to practice. Currently, much of temperament research is not easily applied to clinical situations. Collaboration between clinicians and researchers is particularly recommended to further advance the art and science of temperament-based intervention. Clinician-researchers bear a particular responsibility for advancing the science of temperament based intervention. Randomized clinical trials testing the effectiveness of promotion, prevention, and treatment interventions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protocols, a task which is particularly challenging because much of temperament intervention is highly individualized. But a standardized approach is needed so that outcomes can be documented, results can be replicated, and dissemination can occur. <p> Cultural concerns are another challenge. Clinicians and researchers who are designing temperament-based intervention need to consider the race and/or ethnicity of the participants. The vast majority of child development studies, including those investigating parenting and temperament, have focused on white, middle income families. A notable exception involved a cross-cultural comparison of goodness-of-fit. Although the subjects in the NYLS( Thomas et al., 1963) were primarily white and from middle to upper-middle income families, a similar, but lesser known study was conducted with a working class Puerto Rican sample( Hertzig, Birch, Thomas, &; Mendez, 1968). Comparisons between these two groups led Chess and Thomas( 1984) to conclude that goodness-of-fit always exists within a social context. Environmental constraints due to ethnic or socioeconomic factors contribute to what parents and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperament-based management strategies. For example, suggesting that a child whose temperament is high in activity nm around the block would be unsafe in many inner city neighborhoods. <p> Clinician-researchers who wish to test the effectiveness of their intervention face methodological challenges. Selected instrumentation should be adequately developed to reliably capture the phenomenon of temperament as well as the measurement of the intended outcomes of the intervention. The task is particularly difficult for promotion and prevention programs because participants are recruited from nonclinical community samples. Measurement must be highly sensitive to reflect the subtle changes in behavior that occur in nonreferred samples. <p> Parental self-reports are, too often, the only source of measurement. The reliability of parental reports is often questioned( Bates &; Bayles, 1984 ; Earls, 1981 ; Gibbs, Reeves, &; Cunningham, 1987). Other techniques are available to minimize the potential distortion of reliance on one source of information and one type of measurement. Videotaped laboratory observations can be used to examine mother-child interactions. To control for parental social desirability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that highly correlates with observed maternal authoritative behavior( Kochanska, Kuczynski, &; Radke-Yarrow, 1989) can be conducted. Another way to control for parental bias is to use the Parent Daily Report( PDR ; Chamberlain &; Reid, 1987), in which mothers are telephoned to inquire whether previously identified problem behaviors have occurred during the last 24 hours. The PDR correlates with direct observations on both clinical and nonclinical samples( Chamberlain &; Reid, 1987 ; Webster-Stratton &; Spitzer, 1991). Multisource, multimethod data from other informants such as teachers and clinicians also is recommended. Discrepancies among the various informants is inevitable and will need to be examined for its empirical and clinical meaning. <p> Statistical techniques which take into account the complexity of examining the effectiveness of temperament-based intervention are another methodological concern. The traditional repeated measures analysis of variance frequently used in clinical trials is likely to be inadequate, because multiple intervening variables will affect the response of families to intervention. Hierarchical linear modeling( HLM)( Bryk &; Raudenbush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examining individual and group contextual variables simultaneously. However, HLM requires more subjects than is likely to be feasible for clinical trials. Covariates, exploratory data analysis, residual analysis, and other techniques can be used to examine how the competing contextual variables influence the achieved outcomes. <p> In the end, the most formidable challenge of conducting temperament-based intervention is designing an application that meets the needs of the particular clients for whom it is intended. While guidelines and strategies from others may assist, the clinician must take ownership of the intervention, adapting it to the needs of the setting and participants. Otherwise, the approach will not be compelling in its delivery. Developing or adapting temperament-based intervention is not a trivial task, but one that requires a considerable intellectual investment coupled with clinical expertise. Temperament-based intervention will be facilitated if a clinician has colleagues who share an interest and a commitment. Interdisciplinary collaboration within the setting is likely to lead to greater sophistication in the conceptualization and delivery of temperament-based interventions. Parental and other caregiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is culturally appropriate and to ascertain whether it produces the intended outcomes. <p> The practice of temperament-based intervention is still in its formative development. The relative scarcity of clinicians who are using temperament-based interventions, coupled with their wide geographic dispersity, has complicated the advancement of the practice application. Dissemination of information regarding temperament-based intervention and networking among clinicians and clinician-researchers is critically needed. Publications, conferences, and informal networking with newsletters and list-serves are among the vehicles that should be used. <p> Temperament-based intervention holds the potential to mobilize psychologists, teachers, parents, and other caregivers to establish school and home environments that supports the individual needs of children. Simply put, temperament-based intervention recognizes child temperament, reframes adult perceptions, and assists caregivers in responding more effectively. A multiplicity of intervention variations on that theme are anticipated to evolve during the ensuing years, emanating from the creativity of expert clinicians. <p> Address all correspondence concerning this article to Sandra Graham McClowry, Associate Professor, Division of Nursing, 34 Stuyvesant Street, Barney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10003.
