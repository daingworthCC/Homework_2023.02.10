4010641 Historically, the school psychologist 's work in early education has been restricted primarily to providing services to young children with special education needs. A more contemporary model calls for an expanded role with a focus on school readiness and the provision of services to all young children and their families in a prevention-oriented approach that is likely to maximize efforts to improve educational and social outcomes. Guided by best practices in school psychology, school psychologists can assist parents and early educators in taking a deliberate and intentional role in facilitating child development. By acting as a liaison between the school system and early childhood settings, school psychologists can assist schools in preparing to meet the diverse needs of their youngest students and can assist early childhood educators in better preparing children for school entry( Carlton &; Winsler, 1999). The purpose of this article is to discuss an expanded role for school psychologists in early education within the context of school readiness and organized around the domains of assessment, consultation, and intervention. In addressing each of these domains, applications of best practices in school psychology are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highlighted to illustrate the potential contributions of collaborative efforts of school psychology and early education. Finally, challenges to this contemporary model are discussed. <p> More than ever, children between birth and the age of 5 years are exposed to educational experiences before formal schooling in some type of structured setting( Lombardi, 2003 ; National Institute for Early Education Research, 2003). Historically, young children have participated in structured preschool experiences as a result of an identified disability( e.g., Part H now known as Part C of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, which has served roughly 5% of the preschool population since 1986) or as part of a compensatory program( e.g., Head Start, which has served roughly 50% of preschool-aged children living in poverty since 1965). In 1999, however, almost 65% of all children ages 3-5 years participated in some type of center-based preschool, with 46% of 3-year-olds, 69% of 4-year-olds, and 76% of 5-year-olds enrolled in programs( National Center for Educational Statistics, 2000) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act have ensured continued delivery of services to infants, toddlers, and preschoolers with disabilities and renewal of Head Start funding has allowed for continued programming for children at risk and living in poverty. Other federal legislation, such as No Child Left Behind and Good Start Grow Smart : The Bush Administration 's Early Childhood Initiative( 2002), has recognized the need to include all young children in service delivery and promoted strengthening the quality of early childhood education services. State initiatives have promoted universal preschool, which " refers to the goal of making available to families of all 3- and 4-year-olds a program of services that provides high quality education for children and helps to prepare them for a successful entry to kindergarten "( Bailey, 2002, p. 3). As of fiscal year 2000, 32 states and the District of Columbia had state-funded preschool initiatives( Gilliam &; Ripple, 2004). <p> Although increasing numbers of children are accessing educational opportunities before kindergarten, there are tremendous differences in the types and qualities of preschool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Human Development Study of Early Child Care, fewer than 20% of preschool centers offered care highly characteristic of positive caregiving( National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Early Child Care Research Network, 1996). Across states providing preschool, program components such as teacher qualifications, in-service training requirements, technical assistance, and collaboration with other service providers vary( Gilliam &; Ripple, 2004), potentially affecting the quality of the services provided. Poor-quality early education has contributed to alarming numbers of children arriving at kindergarten without the academic and social skills needed for school success( Shonkoff &; Phillips, 2000). In addition, there is increasing concern that many schools may not be prepared to meet the diverse needs of the children and families they serve( Adelman, 1996), especially affecting children who enter school without the foundational skills needed for school success( e.g., children with special education or health care needs, linguistic and cultural differences, and those with risk factors ; Ramey, Ramey, &; Gaines Lanzi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who start formal schooling without sufficient academic and social skills is discouraging. As early as kindergarten, young children who experience poor social and learning experiences at school may engage in a negative cycle in which outcomes such as continued academic difficulties, antisocial behavior, and withdrawal from the school environment become increasingly likely( Ladd &; Coleman, 1997). Further, research indicates that differences in general cognitive competencies between children from high- and low-socioeconomic status backgrounds are apparent by 3 years of age, and that this gap increases through the preschool years( Case, Griffin, &; Kelly, 1999 ; Stipek &; Ryan, 1997). Finally, research suggests that school readiness at kindergarten entry has direct and indirect effects on first-grade schooling outcomes, and the link between early performance and later achievement also has been demonstrated across longer intervals of time, with prekindergarten performance being related to academic achievement through Grade 10( Stevenson &; Newman, 1986). <p> Recently, a transactional perspective of school readiness, consistent with a focus on prevention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population( Fantuzzo, McWayne, &; Bulotksy, 2003 ; Power, 2003 ; Shapiro, 2000 ; Sheridan &; Gutkin, 2000), has been advocated to address the diverse needs of children entering kindergarten( Carlton &; Winsler, 1999). This transactional model centers on the readiness of the child to enter school as well as the readiness of the school to receive the child and meet the child 's individual developmental needs, using dynamic models of assessment and working closely with parents and teachers to promote positive outcomes. The purpose of this article is to discuss an expanded role for the school psychologist in early education( n1) within the context of school readiness and organized around the domains of assessment, consultation, and intervention. In addressing each of these domains, applications of best practices in school psychology are presented with modifications relevant to early childhood, and the skills and knowledge necessary to implement such practices are delineated. In addition, research is highlighted that illustrates the potential contributions of collaborative efforts between school psychology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> School psychologists can contribute to meaningful assessment and effective intervention in the context of school readiness by providing early educators with a scientific framework for interpreting rate of skill development relative to various criteria for growth and development. School psychologists can work with early educators to identify instructional foci and curricula that are well matched to children 's individualized needs and assist with assessment plans that are technically meaningful and family centered( McWilliam, Maxwell, &; Sloper, 1999). Whereas traditionally school psychologists ' involvement in early education has been restricted primarily to providing services to young children with special education needs, an expanded role with a focus on school readiness calls for the provision of services to all young children and their families in a prevention-oriented approach. Assessment <p> Best practices in school psychology promote assessment methods that facilitate the measurement of skill growth over time and contextual and functional approaches to skill development and behavior. Two major foci are general outcome measurement( GOM ; Fuchs &; Deno, 1991 ; Shinn, 1989) and functional behavioral assessment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both of these approaches extend assessment practices beyond traditional eligibility decision making, emphasizing a teach-test-teach model instead of a refer-test-place model( Flanagan, Sainato, &; Genshaft, 1993). Further, both GOM and FBA can be used in the context of school readiness to support children as they transition from early childhood settings to formal schooling. <p> A GOM approach to assessment is designed to determine child progress toward long-term goals by frequently monitoring skills that represent critical and valued goals of the educational or developmental process( Fuchs &; Deno, 1991). GOM generates data that can be used to monitor and evaluate the progress of individual children as well as groups of children. Many schools using GOM in K-12 settings( e.g., Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills ; Kaminski &; Good, 1996 ; curriculum-based measurement ; Deno, 1985) have sought out similar models for younger children to create a meaningful link between early education and formal schooling( Missall, McConnell, &; Cadigan, 2006). For example, early literacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research Institute -- Measuring Growth and Development, 1998, 2000) assess vocabulary, rhyming, and alliteration, three skills related to successful reading. Collecting GOM data on all children can facilitate the establishment of benchmarks, or set criteria, for success. School psychologists can assist early educators in using this information to inform instruction and intervention to accelerate the progress of those children who are struggling and assist them in meeting the criterion. Further, school psychologists can aid kindergarten teachers in using preschool GOM data to plan instruction to accommodate diverse learners as they enter kindergarten( Fuchs &; Fuchs, 1998). Evidence-based practice for the use of GOM and other alternative assessment models is growing( see Bagnato, 2005, for a detailed discussion). In this issue, Greenwood et al.( 2006) describe the development of a GOM, or an IGDI for problem-solving in infants and toddlers. In a field-based application of GOMs, the utility and social validity of the early language and literacy IGDIs for monitoring the growth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the use of the measures to evaluate the effects of intervention( Phaneuf &; Silberglitt, 2003). <p> Many of the skills that school psychologists employ in implementing GOM systems in the K-12 setting generalize to early education settings with some modification. In each setting, school psychologists need to be able to evaluate curricula, articulate the goals of instruction, and identify instructional targets related to the broad outcome measured by a GOM. In early education settings, it is particularly critical that school psychologists undertake this task in relation to the goals of formal schooling to specify measurement and instructional targets linked meaningfully to skills and knowledge needed for success in kindergarten. Knowledge of early education curricula can be gained primarily through a review of instructional materials, teacher interviews, and observations. Because a formal curriculum may not be used in all early education settings, specific knowledge of early development is necessary for the identification of target skills that are predictive of performance of important or valued behaviors at a different stage of development, or a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development for infants and toddlers( e.g., Early Communication IGDI) and preschoolers( e.g., Picture Naming IGDI) focuses on early communication skills and expressive vocabulary, indicators related to the broader behaviors of cognition, social interaction, and reading. School psychologists must understand how target skills are represented in the curriculum, realized in everyday activities, and connected to long-term goals. <p> In addition, school psychologists must understand the conceptual foundation of GOM to effectively use the system in the context of school readiness. GOM could be used potentially for screening, identifying children in need of instructional assistance, designing interventions, and evaluating the effects of instruction and intervention, all essential components to improving outcomes for children that hold promise for use in a response to intervention system( VanDerHeyden, 2005). As school psychologists in early education typically have been limited to traditional eligibility assessment activities that have questionable instructional utility( McConnell, 2000), the challenge is to create a new role for assessment and school psychologists that is prevention oriented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychologists to collaborate with early educators to facilitate competency in key skill areas and promote school readiness for all children. Finally, one of the current significant limitations of GOM in early education is limited accessibility( www.getgotgo.net ; www.igdi.ku.edu). Related to this issue is the need for more extensive documentation of the reliability, validity, and utility of GOM in early education. School psychologists can assist with further research efforts in these areas to increase the accessibility and use of GOM. School psychologists can also assist early educators in using more readily available curriculum-referenced measures( e.g., Assessment, Evaluation, and Programming System ; Bricker, 2002) to promote formative assessment and data-based decision making. <p> Whereas GOM is a measurement technology, FBA is a scientific framework to guide assessment, decision making or data interpretation, and intervention development ; hence, GOM may be used within FBA to inform those processes. Several studies have demonstrated the utility of functional assessment for young children with behavioral difficulties( Boyajian, DuPaul, Handler, Eckert, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Lentini, &; Clarke, 2004 ; VanDerHeyden, Witt, &; Gatti, 2001). Boyajian et al.( 2001) demonstrated the use of brief functional analyses with preschoolers at risk for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Procedures were effective in identifying conditions under which problem behavior occurred and developing interventions to reduce the problem behavior. In a group application, VanDerHeyden et al.( 2001) used descriptive assessment to identify variables maintaining disruptive behavior in two early education classrooms. Based on the assessment, intervention procedures were developed that reduced problem behavior at a classroom level. <p> FBA can be used to promote school readiness by reducing problem behavior that interferes with a child 's ability to learn and interact with others. Replacement behaviors can be strategically selected to link to the instructional and social behavior that children need for school success, such as attending skills, following directions, engaging with materials, and participating in group activities. Because these self-regulatory behaviors, or learning-related social skills, are predictive of future difficulties( McClelland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prevention perspective these types of behaviors make ideal targets for intervention. Moreover, in survey studies kindergarten teachers have rated learning-related social skills as critical to successful adjustment in kindergarten( Foulks &; Morrow, 1989) and have indicated that such behaviors are a problem for half or more of the children entering kindergarten( Rimm-Kaufmann, Pianta, &; Cox, 2000). <p> Although the conceptual structure of FBA generalizes easily across different populations, application of the procedures to early education may require some modifications. School psychologists may need to modify existing assessment methods to adequately capture environmental variables in home and early education settings as activities and routines are likely to be significantly different from those in school-based settings. For example, scatter plots used to examine the temporal relation between a child 's behavior and different contexts( Touchette, MacDonald, &; Langer, 1985) may reflect caregiving routines as well as class activities ; interviews may have a similar focus( e.g., the Waking Day Interview ; Barnett, Bell, &; Carey, 1999 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( e.g., the use of physical indicators showing children where to sit during large group activities) ; and behavioral observations may focus on engagement in play or group participation as opposed to academic on-task behavior. General knowledge of child development assists in modifying procedures with a home-based focus while practical experience in early childhood settings contributes to the knowledge base necessary to modify procedures with a classroom focus. Finally, familiarity with the eco-behavioral early childhood literature( Dunn, 1993 ; Kontos, Burchinal, Howes, Wisseh, &; Galinksy, 2002) and the environmental arrangements literature( Lawry, Danko, &; Strain, 1999) can assist school psychologists in better understanding the complexity of early childhood settings and enable them to identify key variables in supporting children in the classroom. Consultation and Intervention <p> Working in partnership with parents and early educators, school psychologists can provide coaching and facilitate problem solving about classroom and individual child issues( Donahue, Falk, &; Provet, 2000). A number of studies have suggested the effectiveness of consultation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children( Boyajian et al., 2001 ; Duda et al., 2004 ; LePage, Kratochwill, &; Elliott, 2004 ; McGoey, DuPaul, Eckert, Volpe, &; Van Brackle, 2005). For example, in their study with two preschool-age children, Duda et al.( 2004) used consultation procedures to develop a positive behavior support plan based on functional assessment procedures. Interventions were implemented in the children 's natural environment and resulted in decreases in problem behavior and increases in active engagement across settings. In an investigation of consultant outcomes, treatment effects, and consumer satisfaction with preschool consultation, LePage et al.( 2004) reported improved outcomes( e.g., decreased aggression and tantrums and increased social interaction) in the majority of cases, with most treatment goals being met in more than 70% of cases. Further, parents and educators indicated satisfaction with the consultation process. <p> Although behavioral issues often are the central focus of consultation in early education, instructional consultation is equally important when considering issues of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing children with key foundational early learning skills. Emerging evidence suggests its effectiveness in accelerating the development of children at program and individual child levels. For example, an evaluation of Pittsburgh 's early childhood initiative found that progress of high-risk children was associated with participation in programs that received ongoing collaborative consultation and mentoring( Bagnato, Suen, Brickley, Smith-Jones, &; Dettore, 2003). In just one example at the individual child level, consultation procedures were used to teach parents to use responsive interaction and incidental teaching skills, which resulted in an increase in children 's verbal behavior and parental maintenance of skills( Peterson, Carta, &; Greenwood, 2005). Given increasing evidence about the importance of early experiences in promoting educational outcomes( Hart &; Risley, 1995 ; Shonkoff &; Phillips, 2000), working with caregivers to increase their active engagement in their child 's learning is an essential and pivotal role for school psychologists in promoting school readiness( Carlton &; Winsler, 1999). School psychologists can assist parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in facilitating development by strategically planning learning experiences for young children. <p> In consulting with early educators and parents, school psychologists are likely to use a range of consultation models consistent with general training in consultation, such as behavioral, organizational, instructional, and mental health models. Most models likely will use a problem-solving approach to some extent that focuses on operationalizing the problem in behavioral terms and working collaboratively with educators and parents to address the problem. In terms of process and procedures of consultation, then, for the most part school psychologists can generalize their existing skills to providing services to early education settings with some modification. For example, school psychologists could facilitate consultee-centered groups to address classroom concerns( Babinksi &; Rogers, 1998), or at the organizational level, consult within an early education setting regarding implementation of screening for social emotional difficulties. <p> Flexible interpersonal skills may be necessary to best establish productive and effective collaborations. In early education settings, school psychologists may consult with teachers with limited formal training as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of physical, occupational, speech, and language therapies, and of medical issues. School psychologists in early education settings likely develop a style of interpersonal interactions through practical experience with multidisciplinary collaborations. These practical experiences afford school psychologists a better understanding of the unique culture of each early education program, which is essential to forming effective partnerships( Donahue et al., 2000). They also allow school psychologists to make modifications to consultation procedures to best meet the needs of a particular setting. For example, because it may be more likely that professional service is provided directly in the early education classroom, consultative sessions might be conducted during classroom playtime on the floor with children, often by directly modeling proposed strategies. <p> Perhaps one of the more significant modifications that school psychologists make in providing consultative services in early education settings is an increased emphasis on working with families. Engaging families in their child 's education at the earliest point possible is particularly critical in early childhood, given parents ' role as the primary educator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view family services in terms of parent involvement and home school partnerships. Although home-school collaboration interventions( e.g., daily report cards, school-to-home notes) have been demonstrated to be effective in improving academic and social outcomes( Cox, 2005), consistent with early intervention, school psychologists in early education settings need to go beyond this perspective and advocate for a more family-centered approach that emphasizes support to families as a goal in itself, not just as a way to directly influence the child 's educational functioning. That is, support to families is not solely to improve educational outcomes for the child, but to more broadly enhance families ' functioning in their role as caregivers. As such, in a family-centered approach, school psychologists can involve families as key decision makers and consider their needs beyond their child 's education( McWilliam et al., 1999). Because young children are affected by family issues, meeting the needs of family members can indirectly, yet significantly, enhance a child 's educational functioning. Understanding familial, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their families, as well as cultural influences, facilitates a collaborative family-centered approach to planning and implementing interventions. <p> In terms of the content or focus of consultation with early educators and parents, school psychologists need to expand their role in intervention development and implementation beyond the traditional psychoeducational issues of the school setting. In developing interventions, school psychologists promote instruction and intervention that blend developmentally appropriate learning perspectives and expectations with intentional and strategic adult-guided learning and scaffolding to increase the child 's capacity to function in his or her environment( Wolery, 2000). Although more research is needed to identify effective intervention and instruction in early education settings, several sources focused on young children with disabilities provide strategies that can be used regardless of disability status( see Cavallaro &; Haney, 1999 ; Pretti-Frontczak &; Bricker, 2004 ; Sandall &; Schwartz, 2002). <p> Content-related knowledge about important developmental domains, target behaviors, and interventions related to school readiness is essential, particularly language and early literacy( Barnett et al., 1999) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an effective means of increasing language and early literacy skills( Crain-Thoreson &; Dale, 1999). Research also indicates the need for school psychologists to give attention to interventions that promote early learning development in other important areas, such as mathematics. Starkey and Klein( 2000) reported that a parent-child mathematics intervention with 59 Head Start families was effective in the development of more extensive mathematical knowledge. In addition to specific skill areas, school psychologists can assist in the implementation of strategies to facilitate active engagement and the development of learning-related social skills as these are indicators of classroom quality and predictive of later school success( McClelland &; Morrison, 2003 ; McClelland et al., 2000 ; Raspa, McWilliam, &; Ridley, 2001). <p> To address behavior concerns, school psychologists in early education settings can be instrumental in promoting the use of a systematic approach to preventing and managing behavior problems. Although the positive behavior support systems literature typically has focused on its use with older children, the basic principles and procedures can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, &; Becker, 2005, for a more detailed discussion). At the primary or universal level, school psychologists can assist early educators in identifying behaviors essential for school readiness and social competence, developing a plan to teach and reinforce those behaviors in the early education setting, and creating supportive environments through environmental arrangements. For example, a classroomwide intervention involving instruction in direction following, sharing, and problem solving was demonstrated to be effective in improving the adaptive behavior, social interaction, and attention of children in Head Start classrooms( Serna, Nielsen, Lambros, &; Forness, 2000). At the secondary or targeted level, school psychologists can provide direct service, perhaps by conducting social skills training for at-risk young children, or training and supporting early educators in providing social skills instruction( Denham &; Burton, 1996 ; Guglielmo &; Tryon, 2001). At the individualized level, school psychologists can use principles of applied behavior analysis( e.g., differential reinforcement) with developmentally appropriate modifications as needed. For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided more frequently and more immediately for younger children than for older children. Further, school psychologists may need to work closely with early educators to ensure that interventions are consistent with guiding philosophies common in early education settings. For example, timeout from a reinforcement procedure may not be permissible, or the use of tangible reinforcements may be discouraged in some settings. To promote social validity( Wolf, 1978) of interventions, effective school psychologists will work to ensure that there is a connection between intervention strategies and goals of important stakeholders. Further, school psychologists may assist in achieving a balance between acceptable practice and effective practice as the two are not always synonymous, particularly in early education where perspectives about instruction and intervention may vary widely. Integral to this balance is the ability to adapt interventions to be more acceptable while maintaining effectiveness. <p> Although creating productive partnerships with families as well as educators may be important to successful implementation of all levels of positive behavior support( Minke &; Anderson, 2005), the principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be extended to school psychologists ' work with families. Interventions at this level typically consist of FBA procedures and interventions documented to be effective with families with children with and without disabilities( Lucyshyn, Dunlap, &; Albin, 2002). Collaborating with families requires school psychologists to be familiar with interventions that focus on concerns beyond the classroom, such as challenging behaviors while transporting children, sleep, toileting issues, and other daily caregiving routines( Barnett et al., 1999). In addition to addressing behavior issues in the home, school psychologists can actively promote skill generalization by helping parents understand the importance of consistency of interventions across settings and supporting parents in implementing school-based interventions in the home setting. Finally, to promote family-centered practices, it is particularly important for school psychologists to understand a family 's perspective of their own needs, values, and resources( Bailey, 2004 ; Dunst, Trivette, &; Deal, 1988) as a starting point for consultation and intervention. <p> In general, school psychologists support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be individualized or provided in a group format through workshops or training opportunities. Although these activities may differ in terms of the intensity of services, both require collaborative efforts best developed through genuine and meaningful relationships( Donahue et al., 2000) and use research-based knowledge to ensure effective intervention development. For school psychologists to do this effectively, they need content-related knowledge of important domains in early development( e.g., early literacy, language, number sense, social competence) and an understanding of principles of intervention in early education, specifically that interventions should be naturalistic, embedded, and activity based( Bricker, 2002 ; Sandall, McLean, &; Smith, 2000). Routinely accessing early childhood special education and early intervention research in publications such as the Journal of Early Intervention, Topics in Early Childhood Special Education, and Early Childhood Research Quarterly assists school psychologists in being informed about important developments in the field. In addition, resources such as Engaging Young Children in Mathematics( Clements, Sarama, &; DiBiase, 2004 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Early Childhood Development( Shonkoff &; Phillips, 2000), and The Transition to Kindergarten( Pianta &; Cox, 1999) can offer school psychologists important developmental information to inform intervention development. Challenges and Implications for Practice <p> Many of the skills that school psychologists need to work effectively in early education are part of the typical training in school psychology. With modifications, these skills can be used to promote positive outcomes for very young children in the context of school readiness. There are several issues, however, that must be considered if school psychologists are to collaborate effectively with early educators and take a more active role in early education. First, early education programs are diverse in terms of teacher preparation and certification requirements, organizational structures, funding sources, and program philosophy goals. These variations may have implications for the role of school psychologists in specific settings. For example, working more closely with families may be facilitated in Head Start 's model and may provide more of a challenge in settings in which family involvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are required to contract with a mental health consultant, whereas publicly and privately funded preschools may not have access to such services. School psychologists ' roles and responsibilities must change according to the needs of each setting. Research with Head Start indicates that early educators and mental health consultants " need help in better observing and understanding the behaviors of children, understanding the role of trauma in their lives, and becoming more careful observers of child and family strengths and weaknesses "( Knitzer, 2004, p. 185). Also, this research has shown that efforts to improve outcomes for young children should include the provision of " technical assistance that is more individualized, sustained, and ' hands-on ' regarding classroom incorporation of strong language and literacy programs and appropriate learning activities to maximize all children 's school readiness skills "( Ramey &; Ramey, 2004, p. 15). It is likely that early educators in other settings would also benefit from consultative support in the same areas. Thus, despite programmatic differences, it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services school psychologists provide to early education programs, namely, collaborating to support children 's social and preacademic development in the context of school readiness, consistent with the paradigm shift( Reschly &; Ysselyke, 2002) and general movement of the field of school psychology( Dawson et al., 2004). <p> In addition to differences within early education, there are potential differences between the professional perspectives of early educators and school psychologists. Extrapolating from the differences between early childhood philosophies and special education philosophies( Mowder &; Widestrom, 1986), school psychologists and early educators may differ in their perspectives on degree of teacher direction and initiative in early learning, the need for intentional, structured, and individualized learning activities, or the use of classroom behavior management systems. Moreover, many school psychologists may have an overall behavioral orientation toward problem solving, which is a theoretical perspective and approach that may not be consistent with the perspective and approach of early educators. Potential consequences of disconnect include variations in expectations of services, goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example, school psychologists may take a very behavioral approach to assessment, focusing specifically on skill attainment, whereas early educators may take a more global perspective and consider children 's approach to learning or disposition. The assessment tools that each would use, then, varies, as does the expected outcomes of assessment and intervention. School psychologists need to be aware of areas of difference, identify common goals( e.g., prepare children for formal schooling), and work toward improving communication around assessment, consultation, and intervention issues. Perhaps as school psychologists begin to collaborate effectively with early educators in the context of school readiness, successful outcomes will generate a shared perspective that will in turn fuel greater collaboration. <p> Access to settings may be the most significant challenge for school psychologists wanting to extend their services to early education. Many early education programs simply may not have the resources for prevention-oriented school psychology services, and legislative mandates only require schools to provide services to children with special education needs, although this is changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's educational and mental health model may preclude the use of school psychology services for preacademic or behavioral support. Resolving this issue requires a paradigm shift across the disciplines of school psychology and early education to a collaborative prevention model in which all children have access to services to promote positive outcomes. Part of this paradigm shift is a reconceptualization about what school psychologists can contribute to early education teams that is reflective of more contemporary practices( e.g., dynamic assessment, consultation, and intervention development). <p> To that end, Carlton and Winsler( 1999) advocate for a comprehensive outreach program between school systems and area preschools to promote school readiness in which school psychologists would act as a liaison between the two. Such a system would assist in making kindergarten teachers aware of the needs of incoming children and planning appropriate instruction. It also would serve as an informational resource for preschool programs, assisting them to better prepare children for formal schooling. A model of education that focuses on quality experiences before kindergarten and promotes seamless service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can benefit all children( Karweit, 1994). Such a model would include an integrated curriculum that links instructional goals from one setting and grade to another, assessment data documenting progress and response to intervention as children gain skills and transition between settings and grades, and an articulated teaching pedagogy reflective of best practices in related disciplines, such as school psychology and special education. Given the importance of early intervention and prevention and the increasing opportunities for school psychologists to contribute to efforts in this area represented by the sheer number of children in early education programs, the field of school psychology needs to explicitly and directly embrace a training and practice model that reaches beyond traditional K-12 boundaries with an emphasis on school readiness.
