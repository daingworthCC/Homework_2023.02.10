4018841 Section : BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTES PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> This final seventh volume of John Wesley 's Journals and Diaries was initiated in 1988 with the publication of Volume 18 in the Works of John Wesley, now under the general editorship of Richard P. Heitzenrater. The publication of this last volume of the Journal and Diaries represents a landmark in Wesleyan studies. The painstaking and meticulous scholarship of Ward and Heitzenrater has culminated in seven volumes of critically footnoted narrative and episodic information that will serve students of history for many decades. <p> The first six volumes of the Journals and Diaries( Volumes 18-24 of the Works), after Reginald Ward 's 119-page introduction in Volume 18 to the genre of journal and autobiography, contain almost all the actual content of Wesley 's journal and diary entries. This final volume reproduces only the last extract of the Journal( January 1,1787 to October 24, 1790) and the Manuscript Diaries from January 1, 1787 to February 24, 1971. Wesley died the following Wednesday, March 2, 1791, only a week after his last entry. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through an interesting evolution that is quite discernible if one compares entries in Volumes I and II with those in Volume VII. In the earlier installments there is a definite apologetic air to Wesley 's narrative -- as might be expected against hostile accounts surrounding his flight in disgrace from Georgia after the Sophy Hopkey affair, his being banned from Anglican pulpits for perceived fideism, or his conflict with Whitefield over predestination. The copious index to all seven volumes( contained in this final volume) now makes it a straightforward exercise to find his apologetic for the Georgia affair simply by looking under " Georgia " and " Hopkey, Sophia. " The reader can contrast Wesley 's expressed appreciation for the Moravians ' influence on his " conversion "( Volume 18) with his frustrations over their quietism( Volume 19) simply by referencing the index under " Moravians " and " stillness. " Helpfully, if the reader looks first under " quietism, " the editors then lead you to " stillness, " not expecting the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early distinctive characteristic of the Journals and Diaries carries through to the final volume, namely, to define the " character " of Methodism. As one might expect, by the time entries were made from 1787-91, this is no longer an apology directed outward, but there is a recurring note in Wesley 's admonishments that many Methodists were not exemplifying the Christian character expected by their leader. On Thursday, May 3, 1787 he writes : " I took leave... and went on through a delightful country to Clonmel. At six, I preached in the courthouse. I was much surprised. I know not when I have seen so well-dressed and ill-behaved a congregation. " This perhaps means they did not hang on his every word as the eighty-four-year-old icon of Methodism had become accustomed. Wesley adds, " I was told, ' It was the same way that they behaved at church. ' Pity then that they do not turn Papists. The Church of England needs no such members "( 22) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine clothes led also to hardening of the spiritual sensibilities, and the Methodists were chasing wealth rather than " fleeing the wrath to come, " the disposition he cherished the most, as noted on the facing page about parishioners at Cork( 23). It is not the case that these minatory comments are missing in earlier journal entries, but in these pages there is hardly a positive commendation that is not overmatched by negative observations like, " What wonder if all the people were grown dead as stones "( 26). I previously have not read all the Journals looking for these observations, but it is striking how often in the pages we encounter the admonition : " I exhorted to go on to perfection "( 52). Wesley does not entirely forsake the Methodist apologetic in the later Journals, but it is my estimation that from 1778 onward the pages of The Arminian Magazine are his venue for this apologetic. Wesley is deeply concerned about the spiritual vitality of his Methodists, and he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admonish, correct, and supervise them : " The old murderer is restrained from hurting me, but it seems, he has power over my horses "( 31). <p> As in the previous installments, Wesley does not hesitate to report what he allows to be God 's providences, whether they be the miraculous saving of souls fleeing the wrath to come or healing those whom neither his remedies nor the physicians ' could cure. The testimony of Mr. Kingford at Canterbury is unusual only in the level of detail Wesley records : <p> Seven years ago I so entirely lost the use of my ankles and knees that I could no more stand than a newborn child. Indeed, I could not lie in bed without a pillow laid between my legs, one of them being unable to bear the weight of the other. All the advice I had profited me nothing.... At bath I sent for a physician, but before he came as I sat reading the Bible, I thought, " Asa sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 Chron. 16:12 but God can do me more good than any physician. Soon after... rising up, found I could stand. Being much surprised, I walked several times about the room. Then I walked into the square and afterwards on the Bristol road. And from that time, I have been perfectly well. <p> The daily diaries deciphered by Heitzenrater are a completely different genre than the preaching records, social and spiritual commentary of the journal entries. Diary entries note his rising at 4:00 a.m. and end with evening prayers at 9:30 p.m. Typical is his entry for Friday, January 5, 1787 the numbers represent the time of day : <p> 4 Prayed ; read Dr. Hunter! 12 The family. 1 Prayer. 2:15 Dinner, necessary talk religious), prayer ; Hunter. 5 Tea, religious talk ; prayed. 6 Prayed ; Hunter ; supper, religious talk, prayer. 9:30. <p> While entries of this type appear rather mundane and unhelpful, references like " read Dr. Hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they tell us what Wesley was reading at the time he was engaged in various conversations and polemics. In this case, we find an entry in the Journal for Friday, January 5, 1787, that reads, " in the vacant hours of the following days, I read Dr. Hunters Lectures. " The footnote tells the reader that this is Henry Hunter, and that his book is Sacred Biography ; or, The History of the Patriarchs. Even though the Journals omit names of daily conversation and dinner partners, these are included in the diary entries. The cumulative effect of these diary entries is a much more detailed picture of Wesley 's life. They are like the pixels in a digital image ; the more you have the clearer the image. <p> Some remarks are necessary about the detailed footnotes and the Bibliographical Index. The notes provide the reader insight into Wesley 's sources, those noted by him and those silently quoted or plagiarized! Scriptural references are provided for citations as well as clear scriptural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, traveling companions, hosts, and hecklers are given in adequate detail, and other references are made to sources that provide more information. The Bibliographical Index is equally precise. If Wesley mentions reading a piece or refers to it, or if the editors utilize a secondary source, these are all found with full bibliographical information,( 397-505). And this is followed by a comprehensive " Index to Scriptural References "( 507-43) indexed in canonical order with cross-references to every volume and page on which the scriptural text or reference Occurs. <p> It is difficult to avoid overly praising these seven volumes, and especially this last one, which makes all of them eminently useful to the historian and the interested casual reader as well. Their completion is truly a landmark in Wesleyan Studies. <p> By W. Stephen Gunter, Candler School of Theology, Emory University <p>
