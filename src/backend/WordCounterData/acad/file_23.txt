4003241 Section : Africa Rights Monitor <p> I spent a full four weeks in South Africa from February 7 to March 7, 1991, the length of the visa granted me by the South African government. My last visit was in 1954, thirty-seven years ago. During all those intervening years, although I traveled frequently to Africa, I was never allowed into South Africa. I was one of quite a company of " prohibited immigrants, not looked upon as desirable by the regime which espoused apartheid. Now things are beginning to change. Although it took three months for my visa to come through, it finally did, to my relief and great satisfaction. The trip was exhilarating, but there was an air of unreality about it, for even two years ago I did not think I would ever be able to enter South Africa. <p> Everyone who travels knows there is a difference between being inside a country -- on the ground, so to speak -- and just reading or talking about it : that which was distant becomes close up ; that which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, becomes your own. It takes on life. It is the difference between reading a review of a play or a report of a great sports event and actually being on the spot for the performance. I have followed events in South Africa over the years since the early ' 50s, probably as closely as anyone. I could recite familiar statistics about the 17 million Africans who have been arrested in the last 30 years for being in areas reserved for white ; or the 3 + million Africans who have been dispossessed because they lived on land claimed for whites ; or the 80,000 people detained for years without trial ; or the 40,000 South Africans who have been in exile. But these are cold statistics which take on a new reality as one visits the notorious Robben island prison( as I did) off Cape Town and talks with political prisoners who, in some cases, have just begun 25 year sentences ; or goes to the African townships -- Soweto, Alexandra, Guguletu, Crossroads -- and sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, people living in hovels, that are the everyday plight of millions of black South Africans ; or stands on the spot in Sharpeville where, in 1960, the police gunned down 69 nonviolent protesters, and wounded 180 in an anti-pass demonstration which played such a crucial role in changing the nature of the liberation struggle ; or sees burned-out houses in the African township of Mpophomeni in Natal, evidence of Inkatha attacks. <p> Let me try to summarize my impressions of South Africa under a number of headings. Is South Africa Really Changing? <p> This was one of my first and most persistent questions. The answer which emerged is yes -- changes are taking place which help to create a different atmosphere. The fact that I and others who were prohibited from the country can now enter is a minor, but symbolic, change. Thirty-seven years ago I was tailed by police and finally picked up for interrogation when I was in the company of banned Africans. This time there was no surveillance. Why pay attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders are moving around at will and the ban is lifted on the African National Congress( ANC), the Pan-Africanist Congress( PAC), and even the South African Communist Party( SACP)? <p> There are too many changes, large and small, to make a comprehensive list, but among them are : Integration of beaches around Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, and Durban. Suspension of prosecutions under the Group Areas Act( even before the act is officially rescinded). The release of increasing numbers of political prisoners. For example, 31 were released from Robben Island on March 21, including one of the two I talked with when I visited the prison on February 19. Surprising confessions by government leaders. For instance, on February 20 Deputy Foreign Minister Leon Wessels said, " We now know that by apartheid! we hurt our fellow countrymen. It was a horrible mistake that blighted our land. " Discussions between the non-racial sports associations and the traditional all-white groups, seeking an end to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a non-racial and an all-white rugby organization, mediated by the ANC in Cape Town on February 27. Agreement was reached to bring them together in the South African Rugby Football Union. The convening of a broadly representative church conference last November at Rustenburg which brought the main line Dutch Reformed churches and apartheid-minded evangelical denominations together with the churches that have long condemned apartheid as a sin. This was the first such conference in thirty years The revelation by the pastor of a large church in a basically white community in Port Elizabeth that members he had lost by his outspoken opposition to apartheid were beginning to come back, influenced by de Klerk 's initiatives. <p> Many more examples could be given. It is possible to take a somewhat cynical attitude towards these changes by observing that they have been forced on the government and the white minority by sanctions, by resolute opposition inside the country, and by the suffering of hosts of people. However, the fact is that changes are occurring. The talk about a " new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Struggle Over? <p> Will there now be an easy transition to a non-racial society? This was apparently the perception of many in the United States and the international community following the speech of President F. W. de Klerk at the opening of Parliament on February 1, in which he said he would call for the rescindment of the Group Areas Act, the Land Acts, and the Population Registration Act. However, no South Africans that I spoke with had this perception. I recalled Archbishop Tutu 's statement : " In this country we have so many people who want to change so long as things remain the same " Trevor Manuel, a leader of the United Democratic Front and publicity director for the ANC in Cape Town, said to me, " We thought we would see the light at the end of the tunnel when the ban was lifted on the ANC and Mandela was released, but not so. " When I asked Yusuf Cachalia, the former Secretary General of the South African Indian Congress, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still in place, the tribal homelands still exist, the racially divided tri-cameral parliament is still in session with no African participation, and the black majority still have no vote. The problems to be overcome are daunting. <p> The U.S. Ambassador to South Africa, William Swing, with whom I spent an hour in Cape Town, pointed out that 5 percent of South Africans( nearly all white) own 88 percent of the total wealth. Unemployment in African townships is close to 50 percent. It is sobering to visit African townships and see the horrendous conditions. In Alexandra township, north-east of Johannesburg with a population of 200,000, 75 percent of the dwellings have no electricity or running water. <p> While I was in Johannesburg, a survey made by the Star newspaper reported that in the Transvaal, despite the fact that the Reservation of Separate Amenities Act( allowing discrimination in public facilities) had been rescinded, only six of the 47 towns investigated had removed racial barriers. <p> Shortly thereafter, a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conservative Party is proud of it. " This party, which splintered from the National Party of de Klerk, is committed to a racially partitioned South Africa. The Citizen newspaper, close to the government in point of view, reported on March 7, the day I left South Africa, that " leaders of the right are all convinced that their people would fight and be prepared to enter into an armed struggle if a new political dispensation did not accomodate their ideals of separation and private property rights " One of the strongest right-wing groups, the Afrikoaner Weerstandsbewging( AWB), headed by Eugene Terreblanche, announced that the organization had provided paramilitary training for several thousand of its members, now formed into commandos. <p> It is worrisome to talk with some ordinary whites -- taxi drivers, for example. Almost without fail, if I was in a taxi driven by a white the driver would comment on the large number of blacks on the streets. In the Hillbrow section of Johannesburg, where I was staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The drivers invariably commented that 20 years ago there would not have been a single black there. And one said, " It is a bad mistake to turn over the government to these people " Yet, the shops in central Johannesburg now sell more to blacks than to whites. Is There Serious Conflict Ahead? <p> The answer is probably yes. As Beyers Naude, the renowned church leader who was banned for years along with his anti-apartheid Christian Institute, said to me, " The real crunch is yet to come. " The showdown about what course South Africa will take is near, but it has not yet taken place. The government has taken some courageous initiatives by lifting the ban on antiapartheid liberation movements and organizations, by releasing many of their leaders from jail( Mandela most prominently), and by beginning the process of allowing political exiles back into the country. De Klerk has won some respect from many opponents of apartheid for this, even though, they point out, he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> With the exception of the extreme right wing, and perhaps the extreme black nationalist left, there is an area of general agreement on what a " new South Africa " will be. It will be a country in which the vote will be available to all regardless of race, and in which the government will be representative of all the people. There is agreement, therefore, that a new constitution must be framed. But beyond that, differences are great, and herein lies the area of conflict. The principle negotiators are the National Party, which forms the government, on one side, and the ANC and its allies on the other. The ANC, of course, is not the only opposition group. The PAC is very much in evidence, but it probably does not have the same mass following as the ANC at this point. Furthermore, the ANC and the PAC have better relations now than at any time since their split in 1959. Just three days before my arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 30 years. The ANC and the PAC are even talking about forming a patriotic front before beginning formal negotiations with the government, much as the Zimbabwe African National Union and the Zimbabwe African People 's Union did in Zimbabwe. <p> Other political organizations of influence include the Azanian People 's Organization( AZAPO), the head of a number of black consciousness groups ; the Inkatha Freedom Party, which started as a Zulu cultural organization, then transformed itself into a political group centered in Natal province ; the Democratic Party, with a small following composed mainly of liberal whites ; and the Conservative Party, which opposes the government 's steps toward dismantling apartheid and has taken the position of refusing to negotiate with the ANC or its allies. <p> There are two areas of significant difference between the contending forces. The first has to do with the process which will lead to the drafting of a new constitution based on universal suffrage. The government wants to avoid any popular vote before a new constitution is in place. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose purpose would be to draft the constitution as was done in Namibia. The National Party also opposes the idea of an interim government, arguing that its own government is now in place and can not abdicate responsibility. The current government wants to maintain control of the process. <p> The ANC, on the other hand, strongly favors the election of a representative Constituent Assembly. The ANC feels confident it could win significant support in such an election, giving it the opportunity to exercise initiatives now denied the organization. The government has no intention of allowing this to happen. <p> George M Houser is Coodinator of the Southern Africa Education Program at the Stony Point Center, Cickettown Rd. Stony Point, NY 10980 He was Executive Director of the American Committee on Africa( ACOA) from 1954 to 1981. He has been associated with Africa Today since its founding : from 1954 to 1967 it was the journal of the ALCOA, and since 1967 Dr. Houser has been a member of Africa Today Associates His most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glimpses of Africa 's Liberation Struggle( New York : Pilgrim Press ' 1989). ARM is pleased to present his observations of the changing scene in South Africa where the struggle for human rights is at a critical stage <p> Both sides agree to the interim step of holding an All-Party Conference( APC). No date has been set for this conference, but it could not meet before the ANC has its long-awaited national conference in July. Also, there is no announced agreement on who would qualify to participate in the APC. There must be some way of limiting participation to organizations with a serious following. One informal list I saw in a government office in Pretoria included about 50 organizations, some with infinitesimal followings from one of the homelands or from small Indian or Coloured parties represented in the tricameral parliament. A multiplicity of organizations will strengthen the government 's position by offsetting the popular following of the ANC, but the National Party should realize that if it tries to exercise tight control of the APC, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different agendas in mind for this all-party gathering. The government would like it to frame the constitution and be followed by a referendum, seeking the approval of voters, especially whites. The ANC would like the APC to be limited to framing principles for a constitution, mapping out a bill of rights, and electing a constitutional assembly to actually draft and adopt the documents. An interim transitional government might emerge from this process. <p> The second area of difference between South African political organizations has to do with the end product of the constitutional process. The government leans toward a federation and a decentralization of power. Power sharing is the key phrase. In this way more regional and local control could be exercised. This would tend to put the white minority in a stronger position. The ANC favors a strong, unitary, non-racial, parliamentary government. The difference between the two approaches can perhaps be seen in the first steps being made toward school desegregation. It is now possible for formerly all-white schools to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so. However, 80 percent of the parents must vote on the issue, and a majority of 72 percent must approve the desegregation. Even then there is a limit on non-white students of 20 percent of the student body. This is the kind of local option envisioned by the current government. The ANC approach would be quite different. They would simply make segregation illegal. <p> These differences are grounds for real conflict, both in devising a constitution and in creating the kind of government to be installed. No one knows where it will all end. Obviously, the kind of government in place makes a difference in handling basic issues : for instance, in dealing with the claims of whole African communities whose land has been taken from them by whites under the Group Areas or the Land Acts, in equalizing educational opportunities, and in confronting the horrendous housing conditions in urban areas. An ANC-dominated government would lean toward nationalizing major resources and available land. The National Party desires a decentralized government which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acts, which has now been done, will not solve the problem Africans do not have money to buy back land taken from them. The trend for landless rural Africans is to move to the urban areas where they become squatters living in make-shift shacks under unbelievable crowded conditions. Already some 7 million Africans share these circumstances. The problem of inequities in land ownership can be exacerbated as the rich buy the land made available unless this is strictly controlled by government regulations. Can The Whole Process Break Down? <p> Obviously it can. This is a precarious time in South African history. A moment of truth lies just ahead when the rewards of agreement between contending sides can be great and the tragedy of failure enormous. One thinks of other such critical moments in the struggle for independence in Africa : for example, early 1960 in the Belgian Congo. Following a round table conference in Brussels, the government of Belgium announced a date for independence in six months. The announcement was greeted with universal acclaim, only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by several years of chaos. Early 1975 in Angola is another example. A transitional government designed to lead to elections and independence in ten months was set up. The outbreak of civil war, exacerbated by the cold war and large scale international intervention, destroyed the possibility of peace. A more hopeful example is 1989 in Namibia, where elections led the way to the establishment of a government that has brought peace and stability thus far. This period leading toward an APC, and a possible Constituent Assembly, is just such a critical moment South African history. <p> This is a transitional time in South Africa. To succeed, the main political actors must be transformed. The anti-apartheid organizations must be transformed from liberation movements dedicated to the overthrow of the white minority government to political parties engaged in discussion and essentially nonviolent action to bring about change. The government, on the other hand, and those who have profited from the exploitative apartheid system, must be prepared to give up power. One white person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me this way : the process is like peeling an onion. The white minority will be stripped of its power and special privilege layer by layer rather than by cutting through the onion with a knife in one quick motion. <p> The obstacles to a peaceful transition are formidable. The determination of the white right to resist change is one such obstacle. Yet, of all the people I talked with( such as Walter Sisulu of the ANC ; General Secretary Benny Alexander of the PAC ; Helen Suzman, veteran liberal ; Boy Geldenhuys, National Party member of Parliament ; church leaders like Frank Chikane, etc.), not one believed the right wing could make a successful coup. The right is itself divided among the Rambo types who talk of guerrilla war, the theoreticians who unrealistically hope for a peaceful partition of the country, and the frightened ones who arm themselves because they know not what else to do. The feeling I got was that the right can cause problems at the edges, but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has its lunatic fringe. According to a recent document made available while I was in South Africa, one group called the Boer Republic Army, patterned after the IRA, has a hit list of leaders and organizations including not only the ANC, the PAC, and the SACP, but also petrol stations owned by Shell and British Petroleum, and representatives of the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Foundation, and even the CIA. <p> Another obstacle to a peaceful transition is the bloodshed wrought by fighting among essentially black groups. This began in Natal where Chief Buthelezi 's Inkatha Freedom Party has its main strength among the Zulus, and it has spread to African townships in the Transvaal where migrant workers from various ethnic groups are housed in hostels. I am not an admirer of Inkatha or Buthelezi. Although I appreciated the fact that Buthelezi refused to allow KwaZulu to become an independent Bantustan, his political philosophy has been conservative and his own rule autocratic. No African can be employed in KwaZulu who does not sign a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assembly, in which more than a hundred traditional Zulu chiefs serve, is a rubber stamp for Buthelezi. <p> John Aitchison, with whom I spent an evening, directs the Centre for Adult Education at the University of Natal in Pietermaritzburg. He has made a most intensive analysis of the violence in Natal and reported in one of his studies that the " big war " began in September 1987, when Inkatha instituted forced recruitment into its ranks and young residents of the area resisted, particularly those affiliated with the UDF. It is dangerous to oppose Buthelezi in Natal. The day before I arrived in Pietermaritzburg, Chief Maphumulo, who was sympathetic to the UDF and the ANC, was murdered outside his home by an unknown assailant. I spent several hours on February 28 in the African township of Mpophomeni, whose people are know to be sympathetic to the ANC. I saw the damage done to some houses and a Catholic church by Inkatha attacks in April 1990. <p> Although hooliganism may be a factor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Transvaal townships, political controversy is more deeply involved. The meetings between Mandela and Buthelezi in Durban, one of which took place just before I arrived in South Africa and the other on March 30, did not end this conflict. The question is, would it be possible to have peaceful elections in Natal under present circumstances? Most people I talked with were skeptical. <p> A third obstacle to a peaceful transition is the problem of long-term unity within the ANC and the maintenance of a successful united front between the ANC and its allies. The longer the discussions with the government for agreement on a new constitution go on, the more difficult it will be to hold the movement together. There are mutterings of dissatisfaction within the lower echelons of the ANC that the leadership is not communicating effectively with the membership on the discussions with de Klerk. The Winnie Mandela trial has also caused controversy within the organization. It is not easy for the ANC to build up an effective organization after so many years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members at the present time. The hope was that there would be a million members one year after the ban was lifted. The government can take advantage of ANC difficulties to organize the coalition against it among disgruntled whites, Inkatha and elements within the Coloured and Indian communities that accept the racial divisions in the tri-cameral parliament to offset the popular following of the ANC. <p> One thing was very clear to me. Sanctions against South Africa should not be lifted until a clear agreement has been reached about the process for devising a new constitution. Too many things can happen at this stage to knock the process off course. International pressure may still be necessary to see that progress is made towards a democratic solution. What Hope for a Peaceful Transition to a Democratic State? <p> I posed this question to many people with whom I talked. No one had a glib answer. The problems are too serious for that, but I received no cynical answers either. I liked what Nabs Weasels, the director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political prisoners and a hostel for family members who have come to visit prisoners) said to me : " I have a guarded optimism because I want it so much. The alternative is too awful to contemplate. " <p> In spite of fears, a general spirit of expectancy prevails. Changes already occurring strengthen this spirit. As the showdown approaches between the government and the ANC and its allies, both sides try to exercise caution in their public statements. A lot of public attention is given to Joe Slovo, General Secretary of the South African Communist Party and a member of the national executive of the ANC. I met him in the national office of the ANC in Johannesburg. I also came across his trail in various places I was visiting, for he speaks widely across the country. He spoke to a thousand students at the University of Natal in Durban while I was there, sponsored by student organizations. His speeches are designed to quiet fears. The report in the Natal Witness was headed, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " The burden of his speech was that " here in South Africa supporting multipartyism means working very hard to develop a culture of tolerance for diverging political perspectives. It will not be easy, but it is essential that we build from this pile of ashes, a new political culture -- where robust debate, criticism and disagreement does not lead to political suppression. " <p> When I questioned ANC leaders, as well as government people, on how they could solve their fundamental differences on election of a Constituent Assembly, or on the form of government to be created, they responded they may have to compromise. This is what Walter Sisulu said, without defining the kind of compromise that would be acceptable. The left wing of the movement would surely protest any great deviation from the organization 's stated position. The same kind of answer came from Dr. Sandy Shaw, Director of Planning for the government 's Constitutional Development Service, when I met with him in Pretoria. <p> The ANC 's public statements on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whites. The ANC Land Commission, for instance, issued a discussion document at the end of February saying that simple nationalization will not solve the unequal distribution of land. They recommended flexible forms of land ownership, including private, communal, cooperative, and state ownership. A document for internal ANC debate says nationalization " is not a simple, clear-cut issue " The paper said that while nationalization could ensure essential services, better working conditions and increased social expenditure, it could not give a new democratic government the means to provide jobs, houses, and education. <p> Hope for a peaceful transition to a democratic South Africa is strengthened by a general looking-ahead to the post-apartheid era. The Weekly Mail( an anti-apartheid paper) of March 1-7, 1991, ran a special section on " 30 rising stars who 'll shape tomorrow 's South Africa. " An introductory paragraph said, " One hopeful sign is clear amid the deep-seated problems as South Africa enters a period of transition. There is a rich diversity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new society " The list was impressive, including blacks, whites, church people, trade unionists, scholars, business people, and members of the ANC, the PAC, the Democratic Party, and the National Party. I was impressed by the fact that people with whom I talked, although they had suffered detention, torture, exile, and confiscation of land, did not dwell on grievances but talked of the task ahead. <p> There are a multiplicity of organizations as well as individuals making for a dynamic South African society. Even during the heyday of apartheid all kinds of opposition groups survived. And now they are thriving. There is a stimulating mix of organizations -- local, regional, and national -- with independent bases. This is essential in a democratic society. I must have been in the offices of 30 or more such groups quite beyond the essentially political organizations -- Black Sash, Transvaal Rural Action Committee, the Civic Association of Southern Transuaal, Legal Resources Centre, Pietermaritzburg Agency for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South African Health Workers Congress, etc. They will not be stifled. <p> The problems will not go away in South Africa. They must be faced and dealt with by the people who are there. Most whites will not leave the country as the French did from Algeria, or the white Rhodesians from Zimbabwe. Furthermore, just as it is most unlikely that there will be a successful white right wing coup, it is also unlikely that there will be a mass black uprising to take over the government in revolutionary action. The peoples of South Africa have to face the problems of the future together. The probability is that there will be no " independence day " like Namibia 's or Zimbabwe 's. The celebration can be reserved for a new government under a new non-racial constitution. Although plenty of rough days lie ahead, the only secure future in South Africa is for blacks and whites to learn how to live together. <p> One thing is certain in my mind : if a new, democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turmoil of the past decades, it will be a historic miracle. For here is a country that experienced the European invasion, like the rest of Africa, but where the settlers stayed on because of a favorable climate and economy. They ruled a country of diverse people, languages and cultures. They exacerbated the divisions to strengthen their own domination even as the creation of an urban society tore down barriers and a unified opposition was born. Yet the fruits of the divisive policy still exist -- nine languages are spoken in South Africa. Twenty percent of the people do not speak either English or Afrikaans. The whites are divided into English and Afrikaans speaking, with the wounds of the Boer War still festering. The apartheid system that created the homelands not only tried to separate the Africans from one another, but also the Indians and the Coloureds. Not many societies have been so divided and so exploited for the benefit of the settlers. <p> And now this is breaking down. What a challenge to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable, democratic whole. The task should be approached not in dismay, but with a sense of adventure and faith. <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> By George M. Houser <p> <p> George M.
