4002341 By performing one political action, a citizen may simultaneously accomplish both a practical and a symbolic result. For instance, in the act of voting, one not only participates in the determination of public policy but also expresses enthusiasm and discontent, achieves a sense of common social ties, and approves the actions taken by society( Edelman 1967, 203), Symbolic political behavior has been a subject of concern to students of politics for decades( Arnold 1947 ; Edelman 1967 ; Elder and Cobb 1983 ; Kertzer 1988 ; and Hinckley 1990). The addition of symbolism exercises to a secondary-school government class can provide a realistic approach to government in action. <p> The symbol may be on the visible or concrete level, such as the United States Capitol, or an audible impression, such as the sound of Big Ben as a background to Winston Churchill 's wartime speeches( Reid 1970). The symbol may also be more impressionis-tic and invisible ; for example, legislative statutory attempts to regulate a certain function may convey the idea that the function is well in control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulation that is enacted with the greatest fanfare is often the least ambitious( Edelman 1967, 26). Students at the secondary level are capable of thinking symbolically, using a high level of thought processes. Activities that are organized to elicit symbolic responses in the study of government provide students with the opportunities to use their imagination to create a new and different way to look at an idea, value, fact, or object. The Symbolism Exercise <p> In a symbolic exercise, the aim is to encourage the students to obtain a greater understanding of the relationship between the symbol and the apparent dimensions of political phenomena. To begin the exercise, the teacher needs to describe to the class the concept of symbolism in the community in a variety of forms. The forms include the object, the activity, or the issue as a representation of an alternative, often deeper, meaning. The examples of community concerns given to the class should be limited in number so that the creativity of the class members is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one student is selected to list each student in the class by name, give a number to each of them, and describe in a word or two the symbols illustrated by each student. As the students present their symbols, the other class members note the numbers of the presentation that are considered to be the most effective or interesting. At the end of the presentations, the class members select three of the items. The student maintaining the list may be asked to restate the items offered and their numbers in order to assist the voting process. Once the ballots are collected and tallied, they become the basis for granting some reward -- perhaps a few points on the next test -- to the highest vote-getters. <p> Usually students offer a wide range of symbols that relate to community studies. The most common format is the picture ; however, the depictions may have varied levels of symbolic value and depth of emotion. The choice may range from a picture of a government building to some beneficial or destructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in devising items to serve as symbols of their ideas. In one instance, ajar of mud rap-resented the problem of run-off into ponds and streams from the construction of a local mall. Students have displayed various religious writings to symbolize the separation of chumh and state or the influence of religious law upon the domestic law. A parking ticket indicated the penalty exacted by society for violation of its rules. <p> Class members have drawn cartoons of contemporary politicians and political controversies. One student wrote a poem that incorporated the principles dealt with in class and their relationship to the lengths she would go to obtain a good grade. Students played bits from video and audio tapes, which enlivened the class. With a video, a student may depict power or corruption, as it was shown in a movie. An audio tape may be a brief but strong commentary on a social problem or the refusal of those in authority to correct a condition the student considers to be an injustice. <p> Table I is a compilation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courts, and justice in a local community. Symbols such as those have a particularly interesting effect on government students. Learning Issues <p> The symbolism exercise relates closely to other types of teaching methods. Each student presentation provides a simulation, but on a single dimension. Often, the symbols used in several presentations may be related to each other by the teacher to form a more complex simulation. Further, the symbols selected by the students often provide a guide to their insights into ethics or character matters. For instance, the coat hanger in Inherit the Wind will elicit certain points of view that are controversial in nature. This can evolve into a values clarification exercise if the teacher chooses to do so. The reference to certain symbols can also relate to the clarification of values. This may be accomplished by follow-up discussion of symbols that reveal student impressions of their view of issues that the symbols present. <p> Symbolic representation is relatively high on the scale of complexity of learning activity. For example, in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third level of complexity and has implications for the remaining upper three levels as well( Bloom 1985). Evaluation <p> The exercise described here can have many positive results. The students furnish a variety of interpretations and perceptions of the issues, personalities, and other topics that they consider to be important. These perceptions are often based upon the students ' backgrounds and provide an understanding of ethnic heritage and other deeply held feelings. The offering of a symbol of an intensely held point of view may add high drama to a class. Class members may indicate by their quiet attentiveness a concern for the presenters ' ideas and beliefs. The exercise promotes cohesion and morale in the class. <p> The level of motivation of the class often increases, largely because the group finds this to be a different and refreshing activity. Because the exercise calls for a different set of performance skills, students who are not usually involved or interested may " shine. " For instance, a student who is good at seeing relationships may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be interested in the reward for participation. <p> We have found that the use of symbolism results in a deeper understanding of topics to be learned. The students as peers help each other to interpret various meanings from the items of subject matter that they choose to illustrate. The teacher then may select several of the symbols as springboards for further exploration, and the students will usually have an interest in the topic and see its relevance. Achieving these two features of the instruction process -- inter-est and acceptance of relevance -- would otherwise require considerable effort by the instructor. <p> In balance, the negative aspects of introducing symbols in class are few. The exercise can be accomplished in two class periods, one for instruction and assignment, and one for the actual presentations by the students. Although some teachers may see the exercise as no more than simple " show and tell, " the results can be very complex because students are moved to a deeper sense of relevance about the subject matter. In addition, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher to build wider applications of the topic. The use of such an exercise can be very effective in the extension of the learning process. Teaching, which can be both enjoyable and frustrating, is rewarding when the use of symbolism in the classroom helps engage students in learning about the community. PREFORMATTED TABLE <p>
