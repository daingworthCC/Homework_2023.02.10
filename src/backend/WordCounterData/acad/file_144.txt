4019941 The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001( NCLB) is without peer in the annals of federal education legislation. Prior to the passage of NCLB, no law had ever inserted the U.S. Department of Education directly into the sacrosanct areas of state and local responsibility for ensuring student achievement, using research-validated practices, and dictating the qualifications of our nation 's teachers. Teacher quality and the " highly qualified " standard is at the forefront of the NCLB promise( some would say " threat ") that all students will learn more than they are currently learning ; if not, schools and teachers will be held accountable for their failure. As a means to increase student achievement and hold teachers more accountable, NCLB applies pressure to every sector of the education community. Nowhere has that pressure been felt more than in special education programs for students with high incidence disabilities in rural areas where one-third of the nation 's school districts are located. <p> The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the current status of the federal requirements for highly qualified special education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. As adopted in NCLB and the newly reauthorized Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act( IDEA 04), we analyze the impact of the highly qualified standard on recruitment and preparation of special education teachers in rural areas and address alternative approaches for meeting federal requirements. The Federal View of a Highly Qualified Special Education Teacher <p> Signed into law in 2001, NCLB was very explicit about what constitutes a " highly qualified " elementary or secondary teacher. An individual is considered highly qualified if he or she has obtained full state certification/licensure, or successfully passed a state 's teacher licensing examination. A highly qualified teacher is certified or licensed to teach in a given state and must not have had state requirements waived on an emergency, temporary, or provisional basis. New elementary teachers must hold a bachelor 's degree and demonstrate subject knowledge and teaching skills in basic elementary school curriculum, including but not limited to, reading, writing and mathematics. Subject matter competency and teaching skills must be measured by " a rigorous state test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bachelors degree and demonstrate a high level of competency in the academic subjects they teach. Subject matter competence must be measured by " a rigorous state subject matter test, " or by completing an undergraduate major in the subject area, a graduate degree, or by completing coursework equivalent to an undergraduate academic major. <p> Effective 2002-2003, the law required that all new Title I teachers must have met the above requirements. Additionally, a state 's Title I plan must include measurable objectives to ensure that all teachers providing instruction in " core subjects "( such as English, math, science, social studies, foreign languages, or art) meet the highly qualified definition by the end of the 2005-2006 school year. Qualifications for veteran teachers were also specified in statute. Veteran teachers must hold at least a bachelors ' degree and be held to the same standard as new elementary, middle, and secondary teachers. They may, however, demonstrate their competence in the teaching of academic subjects based on " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @).( For more information on HOUSSE criteria, See U.S. Department of Education 2004, The Secretary 's Third Annual Report on Teacher Quality.) <p> Although explicit regarding the expectations for elementary and secondary teachers, NCLB requirements to be a " highly qualified " special education teacher were nowhere to be found. In fact, it was n't until December of 2002 that the Department of Education promulgated federal regulations that were intended to clarify that the standard really does apply to all teachers, including special educators( 34 CFR Part 200, December 2, 2002). As per the federal rule, any special education teacher who directly instructs students on core academic subjects must meet the highly qualified standard. However, the rule further stipulated that any special educator who is not directly instructing students with disabilities in core academic subjects, or who is only providing consultation to teachers who are highly qualified, did not have to meet the same subject-matter competency requirements under NCLB. In other words, some special education teachers would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, regardless of whether they held full state certification/licensure or had successfully passed a state 's teacher licensing examination. Schools received additional policy guidance from the Department of Education on special education teachers and the highly qualified standard in September 2003. This policy stated that any special education teacher who is providing instruction in core academic subjects must be highly qualified in each subject, regardless of the instructional setting. <p> In November 2004, Congress passed H.R. 1350, the Individuals with Disabilities Improvement Act( herein referred to as IDEA 04). A major purpose in amending IDEA 97 was to align current law with the accountability provisions in NCLB, including what it means to be a highly qualified special education teacher. IDEA 04 states that the term " highly qualified " has the same meaning as applied to elementary, middle, and secondary teachers in NCLB( H.R. 1350 Section 602 10AJ). This means that new and veteran special education teachers at the elementary level must have subject knowledge and teaching skills in reading, writing, mathematics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New and veteran special education teachers at the middle and secondary level must have subject knowledge and teaching skills in academic subjects in which the teacher has responsibility for instruction( teacher of record). <p> Specifically, IDEA 04 requires that special education teachers must hold a bachelors degree and ". obtain full State certification as a special education teacher( including certification obtained through alternative routes to certification) or passed the State special education teacher licensing examination. "( H.R. 1350 Section 602 10Bi). As is true with elementary and secondary teachers, highly qualified special education teachers must not have had their certification or licensure requirements waived on an emergency, temporary, or provisional basis. <p> In addition to the above requirements, special education teachers who are teaching core academic subjects " exclusively to children who are assessed against alternate achievement standards " must meet the same requirements as highly qualified elementary teachers unless the instruction is " above the elementary level. " In that case, the special education teacher must have subject matter knowledge appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veteran special education teachers who teach two or more subjects at the middle or secondary level must also meet the applicable requirements in NCLB. New special education teachers who teach multiple subjects must be highly qualified in one subject area( mathematics, arts, or science) and will have two years from the date of employment to demonstrate competence in the additional core academic subjects they teach by passing a state 's HOUSSE or meeting NCLB content requirements. Veteran special education teachers at the middle or secondary level who teach multiple subjects must also demonstrate competence in all core academic subjects they teach by passing a state 's HOUSSE or meeting NCLB content requirements. However, these teachers are not provided a two-year grace period to demonstrate competence in the core academic subjects they teach. <p> Finally, there is no statutory language in IDEA 04 regarding special education teachers who only provide consultative services to a highly qualified teacher. However, report language for H.R. 1350 clarifies it is the intent of Congress that special education teachers in consultative roles be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under Section 602. Applying the Highly Qualified Standard to Rural Special Education Teachers in High Incidence Areas <p> Several factors must be considered in examining the impact of the highly qualified standard for rural special education teachers working in high incidence areas. First and foremost is the need to ensure that all students with a disability in rural schools have access to special education teachers who are able to meet their unique instructional needs as required by IDEA. On this point, there is considerable disagreement among educators as to whether NCLB 's highly qualified standard is synonymous with the concept of " high quality. " As stated by Brownell, Sindelar, Bishop, Langley, and Seo( 2002), the NCLB emphasis for general educators is on a thorough knowledge of the content being taught and the verbal ability to deliver that content. It is not on pedagogy. The need to shift from pedagogy to content knowledge and verbal ability is a central theme in the first annual Secretary of Education 's Report on Teacher Quality( U.S. Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedagogically-oriented courses and student teaching experiences within colleges of education are not requisites for becoming an effective teacher. This position is reinforced in the Title II requirements of the Higher Education Act( HEA). Title II requires that states must have in place requirements for content-specific bachelor 's degrees and assessments that measure prospective teacher 's academic content knowledge. In the third annual report on teacher quality, the Secretary of Education reiterates that " overall, state progress in raising standards for prospective teachers is mixed, and significant barriers still exist for teachers pursuing traditional routes to certification and licensure. "( U.S. Department of Education, 2004). <p> The disproportionate emphasis on content knowledge as espoused within NCLB and by the Secretary of Education runs contrary to the views of many special education professionals. Special education as a field is based on pedagogical expertise, including " continuously assessing student performance, adapting curricula to individual needs, modifying instructional approaches, using positive behavioral interventions, and selecting and implementing appropriate accommodations to facilitate access to the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Teacher Education Division of the Council for Exceptional Children( TED), 2004, p. 1). In espousing this view, HECSE and TED argued that any application of the highly qualified standard to special educators should take into account the importance of pedagogical expertise in meeting the instructional needs of students with disabilities. They strongly suggested that any new provisions in IDEA that allowed special education teachers to become fully licensed or certified by simply passing a content knowledge test " would not be sufficient to meet the diverse needs of students with disabilities. " Special educators must demonstrate their specialized knowledge and skills in actual field settings.( HECSE/ TED, 2004). Obviously, Congress rejected the HECSE/TED recommendation and provided an option in IDEA 04 whereby an individual with a bachelor 's degree and no field experience can become a highly qualified special education teacher by simply passing a state licensing exam. <p> A second factor to consider in examining the impact of the highly qualified standard on rural schools is the critical shortage of special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Menlove and Lignugaris/Kraft( 2004) report that while special education teacher shortages are critical nationwide, they are " most critical in rural areas of the country "( p. 18). Thurston and Sebastian( 1996) suggest that an entire small school district can be jeopardized by the lack of a qualified special education teacher and that filling these positions in rural areas is often more problematic than in urban areas. Rural districts often have yearly attrition rates in excess of 30% and may experience a 100% turnover within three years( Williams, Martin, &; Hess, 2002). <p> Given the existing crisis in the number of qualified rural special education personnel, a logical question is whether the implementation of the IDEA 04 " highly qualified " standard will help or further exacerbate the problem? The issue is complex and dependent upon several interacting variables, including service delivery options in small school districts( particularly at the secondary level) and alternative teacher preparation programs that maintain quality while facilitating access to a career in special education. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural areas, subject matter competence for special educators will be particularly burdensome in secondary schools where a teacher may be responsible for most, if not all, core academic subjects for students in high incidence disability areas. Given that rural areas are already facing the most critical special education teacher shortages nationwide( Menlove &; Lignugaris/Kraft, 2004), the additional subject matter requirements could easily become a further disincentive to a career in the field. A potential way around this disincentive is to modify service delivery. As addressed earlier, the IDEA 04 requirement for subject matter competency applies only to special education teachers who have the responsibility for instruction( teacher of record) and not to " consultative teachers. " As such, rural districts may choose to use special educators more in a consultative role in which they work directly with or support highly qualified general education teachers who have subject matter competence. This option alleviates the need for highly qualified special educators to become proficient in multiple subject areas and is consistent with the view that pedagogical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction, etc) is the hallmark of an effective special education teacher. However, if rural schools choose to modify service delivery and use special educators in consultative roles, they must also ensure that every student 's instructional program meets the requirement for a free and appropriate education( FAPE) in the least restrictive environment. Meeting the Highly Qualified Challenge : Alternative Routes( AR) to Teacher Preparation <p> In aligning IDEA with NCLB, Congress continued its emphasis on alternatives to traditional teacher preparation as a strategy to reduce teacher shortages. As suggested by the U.S Department of Education( 2003), states may " streamline their certification processes and. target talented people who would be turned off by traditional preparation. " The logic underlying this strategy seems to apply best to shortages of math and science teachers. It holds that content mastery and verbal ability are more important to effective teaching than is training in pedagogy. By eliminating formal requirements, it is argued, we may recruit into teaching scientists, engineers, accountants, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by teacher preparation. Although the issue of whether this logic is borne out by research need not be addressed here, suffice to say that it has been hotly contested( see Darling-Hammond &; Ducommun, 2001 ; Progressive Policy Institute, 2001 ; The Abell Foundation, 2001) and that math and science educators have questioned its validity, even within those disciplines. They cite the importance of pedagogical content knowledge and the problems some untrained novice teachers experience in representing what they know in ways that are meaningful to children and adolescents( cf., Nathan &; Petrosino, 2003). <p> In special education, the logic fits poorly. For one thing, our field is not a content area in the same sense as math and science. There is no source of prospective special education teachers who, like scientists and mathematicians, have special education content expertise, and, it is unclear what population of prospective teachers this strategy would tap. Second, as argued before, in teaching students with disabilities, pedagogical expertise is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. It is an essential element of a special education teachers ' repertoire of skills, knowledge, and dispositions. Nonetheless, NCLB policy promoting fast-track teacher preparation has been extended to special education( and elementary education), and special education alternative preparation is a growth industry. <p> Although alternative route( AR) programs differ from one state to the next( and even within states), the defining characteristic of AR programs is access to a teaching credential that bypasses conventional college and university preparation requirements( Hawley, 1992 ; Zeichner &; Schulte, 2001). AR programs are best viewed as existing on a continuum ranging from abbreviated, fast-track training( of the NCLB ilk) to more conventional training that builds on participants ' life experiences( Hillkirk, 2000). Typically, what makes a program alternative is the length and structure of the program, how the program is delivered, and the characteristics of the participants( Rosenberg &; Sindelar, 2001). AR programs are often shorter than traditional programs and often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is facilitated by intensive field-based instruction and feedback. Eschewing much of the pedagogical coursework typical of most traditional initial preparation programs, AR programs emphasize enhanced supervision of candidates who receive on-the-job training as classroom teachers. It is believed that on-the-job training substitutes for the pedagogical training required by traditional programs( Leal, 2004). Finally, because AR programs are designed to supplement supply, they should( and do) recruit different types of teacher candidates than traditional programs : higher proportions of males, persons over 25, members of culturally and linguistically diverse groups, and people who have had business and military experience( Shen, 2000). Finding a population of trainees is important for rural school districts because a program may be tailored to an idiosyncratic homegrown population. As we shall see, homegrown trainees are more likely to be committed to remaining in their communities and addressing the challenges of teaching in rural schools. <p> There has been rapid growth in AR programs, in both general and special education. Feistritzer, Haar, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200,000 persons have been licensed as teachers through AR programs. Currently, 43 states plus the District of Columbia( DC) offer AR programs ; in 1983, by contrast, only 8 states offered such programs. Currently, in special education, 36 states and DC offer 225 programs, over 92% of which lead to generic special education certificates. Nationally, California( 32.8%) and Texas( 16.6%) account for most programs( Rosenberg, Boyer, Sindelar, &; Misra, 2003). Over 15% of currently certified special education teachers earned it through an AR ; among those who are unlicensed and seeking certification, 24% are enrolled in AR programs( Connelly, 2003). <p> Three overlapping factors have contributed to the growth of AR programs in special education. First and foremost is the continuing shortage of qualified teachers. Currently, over 50,000 special educators are less than fully certified for their work, and they are responsible for more than 800,000 students with disabilities( U. S. Department of Education, n.d. a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, most notably college and university degree programs, are unable to meet the demand for qualified teachers, and alternative routes are most common in states with significant shortages. In California, Texas, Georgia, and Louisiana, four states with large numbers of special education AR programs, shortages average 20.2% ; by contrast, in states that offer no AR programs, shortages average 5.76%( Rosenberg et al., 2003). <p> Second, many AR programs have proven successful in increasing the number of teachers from culturally and linguistically diverse( CLD) groups. Over 86% of special education teachers and those in the traditional preparation pipeline are White, while the student population requiring special education services is approximately 38% nonwhite( Tyler, Yzquierdo, Lopez-Reyna, &; Flippin, 2002). AR programs help address the need for greater diversity in the teaching force by recruiting a higher percentage of CLD teachers than traditional training programs( Connelly, 2003). Moreover, of particular relevance to those in rural areas, those trained in AR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in schools where CLD students make up the majority( Shen, 2000). <p> The third factor contributing to the proliferation of AR programs is the strident criticism of the education establishment that questions the validity and usefulness of what is termed an over-regulated, self-serving, and exclusionary system of teaching preparation and licensure( Goldhaber, 2004 ; Thomas B. Fordham Foundation, 1999). These sentiments, also present in the language of NCLB, reflect the view that the education establishment mandates too many pedagogically based requirements in its training programs and that such requirements discourage talented, highly verbal, well-educated, liberal arts graduates from entering teaching. Although viewed by some as a means of de-professionalizing teaching( Berry, 2004 ; Cochran-Smith &; Fries, 2001), these criticisms have propelled many states to empower multiple providers to open a variety of paths to teaching. Not surprisingly, large numbers of individuals who have had limited contact with schools of education have entered the teaching force. <p> What we know about AR programs in special education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher preparation programs generally, no less about how alternative routes might compare to traditional preparation. Only recently has systematic information on special education AR programs begun to accumulate. Based upon a review of the few empirical studies of AR programs, Rosenberg and Sindelar( 2001) concluded that for such efforts to be successful, there must be( a) meaningful school/university cooperation with time allocated to sustain partnerships ;( b) instructional content that is substantive, rigorous, and programmatic ; and( c) substantial use of on-site supervision and mentoring incorporating both university supervisors and building-based coaches. In an analysis of 101 current programs, we( Rosenberg et al., 2003) found that most programs( 71%) involve partnerships among universities, state departments of education, and school districts. For the most part, these programs deliver instruction through a mix of university coursework, district-sponsored professional development, supervised fieldwork, and distance education. Financial support is provided through stipends and salaries, and programs are attracting non-traditional populations to the profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is great variability in the length and intensity of AR programs. Nearly half( 45.3%) of current programs require less than 3 months of preparation before trainees enter the classroom as teachers of record, and nearly 13% require no training at all. About 30% of the programs require no more than 18 months to complete, but most( 60%) require 19 to 36 months. Thus, while many programs offer adequate support, many rush candidates into challenging teaching situations with little preparation and few requirements for on-going professional development. Because of the potential for high attrition, fast-track programs may fail to increase the supply of special educators over the long term, thus exacerbating critical shortages by consuming limited training funds( Billingsley, 2003 ; Katsiyannis, Zhang, &; Conroy, 2003 ; Miller, Brownell, &; Smith, 1999). <p> Designing AR programs for rural schools. Rural districts face particular challenges in recruiting teachers, and their small and declining populations are an important element of the problem. In recent research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and Wyckoff( 2003) found that beginning teachers were highly likely to return to schools near their home towns. In that state, from 1998-99 to 2001-2002, over 80% of beginning teachers took jobs within 40 miles of the high schools they attended. This phenomenon works to the advantage of larger districts with high proportions of high school graduates who go on to college. It works to the disadvantage of very small districts, where small numbers of high school graduates go on to college - and presumably even smaller numbers complete professional preparation and come home to teach.( It also works to the disadvantage of large urban districts, where smaller than expected percentages of high school graduates go on to college.) In rural districts, subsidizing the college education of local high school graduates in exchange for a promise of completing teacher preparation and returning home to teach seems like a promising policy strategy. However, the cost of subsidizing college education may be more than most districts can afford, and although statewide programs are commonplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knapp, 2001), service requirements typically stipulate that recipients teach in the state - but not necessarily in high needs schools. <p> The initial cost of providing a highly qualified teacher should not be the only consideration in deciding on how best to invest the training funds available to districts. The teacher 's skill and impact on student achievement are critical, of course, as is their persistence in the field. An initial investment, however costly in the short term, may be increasingly cost effective as a teacher continues to work - and work effectively - in the district. An initial investment of $20,000, say, may seem costly. However, if the investment yields a capable teacher who works in the district for 10 years, the annual cost of $2,000 seems more reasonable and affordable, particularly in contrast to the cost of repeated recruitment and hiring( Texas Center for Educational Research, 2000). <p> One problem with relying on graduates of traditional programs is that their supply has never been sufficient to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are likely to be recent graduates of teacher education programs( Boe, Cook, Bobbitt, &; Terhanian, 2000). Furthermore, younger teachers are more likely to move from job to job, and more likely to leave teaching entirely( Hanushck, Kain, &; Rivkin, 2004). Alternative routes may be designed to address the particular needs of rural districts, and some elements of design seem more promising for rural districts than others. For example, programs for people who reside in the community seem more likely to succeed than programs that require recruitment of either teachers or trainees from outside the community. Prospective teachers are more likely to remain in schools in communities where they reside( Dai, Denslow, Dewey, Sindelar &; Rosenberg, 2005). For a number of reasons, paraprofessional step-up programs offer good potential for hard-to staff-schools. However, small rural districts may have few potential trainees ; moreover, because participants typically must complete an undergraduate degree program to be considered highly qualified, paraprofessional step-up programs take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readily available to most rural districts, and the small number of potential trainees there makes them undesirable as a target for remote program delivery.( In fact, paraprofessional step-up programs have worked best in larger districts within easy commuting distance of a campus( Epanchin &; Wooley-Brown, 1993 ; Sindelar, Daunic, &; Rennells, in press). Moreover, step-up programs may be hard to replicate in the short term, particularly if all qualified trainees have been tapped for an initial training cohort. <p> Mid-career changers represent a second potential source of local participants for alternative teacher preparation. Because no degree program would be required and training would be shorter and more focused, this option may offer better potential to rural districts than programs for paraprofessionals. On the other, in a rural district, the available supply of professionals seeking new opportunities may be small( and the proportion of adults with bachelor 's degrees is smaller in rural areas than is true nationally( U. S. Census Bureau, n.d.)). Furthermore, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be poorer bets for persisting as teachers than paraprofessionals. For one thing, individuals taking large pay cuts may return to their original careers when opportunities come available, and individuals whose original work had little in common with teaching are at greater risk for attrition than individuals who have experience in closely related fields( Dai et al.). Generally speaking, districts are well advised to learn as much as possible about mid-career changers and to use such information in making decisions about whose training to support. In small towns and rural areas, however, this issue may be less of a problem in that applicants ' potential and motives for changing careers may be widely known. <p> Distance education and web-based courses have been touted as solutions to the program delivery problem( Ludlow, 1999 ; Rosenkoetter, Irwin, &; Saceda, 2004), but in the special education literature evidence of their efficacy is scarce. Western Governor 's University( Garlett, Rosenberg, &; Madigan, 2004 ; U. S. Department of Education, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses, extensive field work, and on-site supervision. WGU currently offers a program leading to K-8 certification and a mathematics endorsement, and soon will expand into special education. We see great promise in programs delivered remotely to candidates who are invested in both their communities and in teaching as a career. Conclusion <p> The passage of IDEA 2004 and the act 's alignment with NCLB has further solidified the federal role in defining what it means to be a highly qualified special education teacher. As the new IDEA comes on-line, several questions must be addressed. Will " highly qualified " actually translate to " high quality? " Will the federal requirements to become a highly qualified special educator decrease the critical shortage of special education teachers in rural schools? Or, will these shortages be exacerbated by driving away potential teacher candidates who do n't see the cost-benefit in meeting the additional subject matter requirements? Will service delivery in rural areas for students with disabilities in high incidence areas have to be modified with increasing dependence on highly qualified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special educators serve in consultative roles? What impact will service delivery modifications have on students ' access to FAPE and their overall academic achievement? Will the federal emphasis and the rapid growth of alternatives to traditional teacher preparation produce high quality as well as highly qualified special education teachers in rural areas? Or, will AR programs produce teachers unprepared to deal with the unique needs of students with disabilities in high incidence areas, and thus contribute to the already high attrition rates in rural schools? <p> As a tandem, NCLB and IDEA 2004 are ushering in a new era in the recruitment, preparation, and retention of special education teachers for rural schools. The stage is set, the actors are in place, and the curtain is going up. We anxiously await the reviews. <p> Michael L.
