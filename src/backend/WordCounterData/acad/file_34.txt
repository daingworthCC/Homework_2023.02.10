4004341 Anthropologists inspired by the works of Michel Foucault have described development as a discourse imposed on the Third World by powerful western institutions. In defining the power of such agencies( especially the World Bank) these authors focus not on the practices of actors or sets of actors, but rather on the ability of such institutions to shape perceptions of Third World peoples and to limit ways of thinking about the world and imagining change. While the focus on language is helpful to understanding how development agendas are " deployed " throughout the world, many critics overlook the important role of local elite groups as well as the agency of development 's " target populations. " The uses of, and popular responses to, " sustainable development " and other development strategies in Bogot, Colombia, show that the development discourse is neither so monolithic nor so hegemonic as some critics suggest. Because of sustainable development 's vague mandate and imprecise terminology, it has been easily manipulated and rewritten at the local level. <p> Keywords : development ; environment ; agency ; poststructuralism ; Latin America <p> Recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important task of unraveling development practice and malpractice from Bretton Woods to present-day interventions including " Women In Development, " " Sustainable Development, " and " Participatory Planning. "( n1) These critics describe development as a powerful discourse, or as a " regime of representation, " which imposes itself on Third World peoples. This discourse facilitates not only the governance and control of the " Third World " by " the West, " but also imposes a hegemonic view of reality which defines non-western peoples as underdeveloped. The consequence of this discourse for those who are its target, critics say, is the perpetuation and expansion of global inequalities, and the " disqualification of non-Western knowledge systems "( Escobar 1995a : 13). In other words, development, as both an idea and a set of practices, has become so pervasive and so powerful, that it is increasingly difficult to imagine alternatives that are outside of the development framework. <p> Such critiques have shown the ways in which the development community shapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of its own stated objectives. Yet these critiques lack, to varying degrees, a meaningful sense of agency or process. We still know very little about who the practitioners of development are, and how policies are shaped by struggles and conflicts within and between institutions. For some, resistance on the part of development 's subjects is a way out of the development " nightmare. " Yet, in-depth discussions of how target groups have resisted and reshaped development programs to date are lacking in such critiques. In fact, arguments of poststructural or postmodern critics of development, share many of the weaknesses of those of their Marxist predecessors, in that they tend to portray " subject peoples " as incapable( or nearly so) of autonomous intellectual thought( reminiscent of the " false consciousness " concerns of some Marxists), and especially in that they tend to ignore the important role of local and national elite groups in importing and redefining " western " development strategies.( n2) <p> A look at the uses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actors( planners, environmentalists, politicians, neighborhood residents, activists) are conscious participants in the development encounter. While the poststructuralist critique of the teleological Marxist analyses of development in the 1970s is a useful step in recognizing the unintended consequences of development, I do not agree with the view of development as a " subject-less " process. This decentered approach to development( most notable in the works of Ferguson 1990 and Escobar 1995a, discussed below) is based on the assertion that events unfold not by the will of knowing subjects, but rather " behind the backs of or against the wills of even the most powerful actors "( Ferguson 1990 : 18). Though many of development 's effects may indeed be unintended by the actors involved, I do not see this as a justification for leaving agency out of accounts of development.( n3) <p> In the eastern hills overlooking Bogots downtown and posh residential areas, " informal " or " marginalized " settlements face a series of development projects, couched in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elite groups hope will result in the eradication of slums or " sub-normal barrios " in their backyards.( n4) While elites import and adapt the sustainable development discourse in an effort to win foreign funding and disguise political and economic interests, the resistance of residents of the eastern barrios to these and other projects has limited the ability of elites, both inside and outside of government, to implement their projects. Moreover, residents rarely buy into the vision of reality presented by developers, planners, and politicians. <p> Deconstructing Development <p> In 1969 Dell Hymes challenged anthropologists to take a stand against post-World War II development schemes and the evolutionary models on which they were based. According to Hymes, anthropology had not been critical of the way Third World societies were described in public policy and social science debates. Hymes argued : <p> The common coin has been " developed " vs. " underdeveloped, " or " modern " vs. " traditional. " I submit that these are equivalents to the " civilized " and " primitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model, combined often enough with the notion of a center of diffusion to less fortunate peoples.. Why is it that anthropologists, so well equipped to expose the error of such thinking in Englishmen and Marxists, have been so little heard from as such thinking proliferated all about them?( 1969 : 28-29). <p> In the 1970s and 1980s many did challenge development practices. A number of anthropologists criticized economic models which presumed the goal of capitalist development for failing to take into account local social, cultural, and ecological factors( Little and Painter 1995 : 602 ; for example, see Polly Hill 's( 1986) Development anthropology on trial). With the influence of dependency theory( Frank 1972) and world systems theory( Wallerstein 1974), scholars were encouraged to view development in the context of center-periphery relations and the expansion of world capitalism. Marxist critiques, such as Cheryl Payer 's indictment of the World Bank( 1982) and Rosemary Galli 's work on rural development( 1981), viewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ronald Chilcote and Joel Edelstein 's( 1974) work, Latin America : The struggle with dependency, argued that " dependent capitalism " was responsible for the region 's state of underdevelopment. Similarly, Lappe and Collins ' widely read Food first( 1977) and( with Kinley, 1980) Aid as obstacle argued that development projects could do nothing to eradicate poverty when they reinforced the structures of inequality that were responsible for such poverty. Hunger was not a product of global scarcity, overpopulation, and diminishing resources, but rather a product of the capitalist system and unequal distribution. These critiques inspired many anthropologists to broaden the challenge to developmentalist thinking.( n5) <p> A new generation of development critics, inspired by the works of Michel Foucault and post-structuralist analysis, has emerged in the past decade, whose critiques focus on development institutions and their discourses. These works reflect a clear influence of the Marxist critiques of development, but poststructuralists choose to evaluate development in discursive, rather than materialist, terms. Geoff Wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and argues that the target-group terminology of multi-national institutions helps to legitimate development interventions. According to Wood, such interventions do not so much improve the conditions of the poor as create a kind of underdevelopment which is both politically and technically manageable. Similarly, Escobar argues that development derives its power in part by creating " visibilities, " that is, by making " target groups " visible as problems to be solved and acted on( 1995a, chapter 5).( n6) In Dahl and Rabo 's edited volume Kam-ap or take-off( 1992), the contributors explore how the targets of development respond to the kind of labeling described by Wood, and how local visions of development intersect with or diverge from the premises of western development. Stacy Leigh Pigg( 1992) explores the social construction of the Nepalese village through development schemes and discourses. Similar to Dahl and Rabo, she asks " how, precisely, an ideology of modernization becomes assimilated into local culture "( 1992 : 492). In an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as a rhetorical tool, and they recognize a variety of " positional perspectives on development "( 1984 : 176-177). However, none of these authors, with the exception of Pigg, looks at how perspectives on development, especially at the local level, are shaped by class interests, nor do they focus on national elite groups and their interests in importing development schemes.( n7) <p> In The development dictionary( 1992), a polemical volume edited by Wolfgang Sachs, the contributors try to construct an " archaeology " of central development concepts.( n8) Sachs sets the tone for an all-out rebuttal of the notion of " development " : <p> Though doubts are mounting and uneasiness is widely felt, development talk still pervades not only official declarations but even the language of grassroots movements. It is time to dismantle this mental structure. The authors of this book consciously bid farewell to the defunct idea in order to clear our minds for fresh discoveries( 1992a : 1). <p> Two recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development apparatus. " James Ferguson( 19941990) and Arturo Escobar( 1995a) expose how the World Bank constructs knowledge about the Third World by examining World Bank projects in Lesotho and Colombia, respectively.( n9) While the two studies differ significantly, they both share a view of development as a powerful discourse. <p> According to Escobar, by the 1970s the development apparatus had become hegemonic as an ideal as well as a set of practices. He argues, <p> This apparatus came into existence roughly in the period 1945 to 1955 and has not since ceased to produce new arrangements of knowledge and power, new practices, theories, strategies, and so on. In sum, it has successfully deployed a regime of government over the Third World, a space for " subject peoples " that ensures certain control over it( 1995a : 9, emphasis added). <p> Escobar 's goal is to show how the " hegemonic worldview of development " operates to exclude alternatives while making it difficult, if not impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imagine the world in other terms. <p> Escobar is careful to say that his critique of development does not imply a conspiracy on the part of planners and policy-makers, yet many of his statements suggest otherwise. For example, he says of failed food and nutrition programs that, <p> One begins to suspect that what is at stake is not really the eradication of hunger( even if the planners wholeheartedly desired so) but its multiplication and dispersion into an even finer web, a play of mobile visibilities which is hard to hold in one 's sight( 1995a : 117). <p> Sachs makes an even more emphatic declaration of the development agenda : " From the start development 's hidden agenda was nothing else than the Westernization of the world "( 1992a : 3-4). After decades of muddled attempts at development, these critics suggest that while the development establishment most often failed in its stated objectives, it has accomplished a progressive standardization, and management, of the world. <p> Escobar does not view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pin the development discourse on any particular set or sets of actors, either in the World Bank, the planning offices in Bogot, or the field stations of rural Colombia. Apparently the agent of this homogenization is the discourse itself, and its uniformity stretches across both time( from World War II to the present) and space( throughout the Third World).( n10) While related to the poststructural notion of a subject-less history, it is also reminiscent of structural Marxist critiques of the 1970s, in which the agent of change and domination was " capital " rather than " discourse. "( n11) We are left wondering where this discourse comes from and how it might be shaped by the struggles of real people. Moreover, by reducing development to discourses rather than historical processes animated by conscious actors we may miss many of the causes and consequences of poverty, violence, and inequality( Little and Painter 1995 : 605). <p> Escobar 's focus is institutions, not people, in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is little in the way of a " thick description " of how agencies like the World Bank really work, how policies are shaped and reshaped by internal struggles and conflicts. Similarly, the Colombian planners are portrayed in two dimensions as well-intentioned but misguided, the hapless pawns of the Bank : <p> One would hate to think that the hard and competent work of the Colombian planners served as( one more) subsidy for the World Bank, an additional mechanism through which this institution dispersed its blueprint and accumulated symbolic capital, but some of this clearly happened( 1995a : 147). <p> To the extent that local and national actors are visible in Escobar 's account, they are depicted as totally constrained by the World Bank, unable to maneuver within the " development regime. " One of the most notable oversights of Escobar 's analysis, as well as the Sachs edited volume, is that he completely ignores the role of local and national elite groups, as well as the state, in importing and implementing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international development strategies not( only) because they have internalized a foreign model of development, but because it serves their own interests. This contention will be amplified in the discussion of sustainable development below. <p> For both Escobar and Ferguson, resistance is both a means for achieving alternatives to development, as well as a way in which anthropologists can play a positive role in the development encounter. For Escobar, resistance, and the failure of development efforts, will lead to the " unmaking " of the Third World and the opening of spaces for " alternative production strategies. "( n12) In this view, resistance is primarily a way to construct new identities necessary for finding alternatives to the hegemonic worldview presented by the development discourse. Yet resistance is also, and more importantly for local peoples, about protecting land and houses from expropriation, and about demanding a fair share of development benefits in the form of education and services. Neither author discusses resistance in depth, nor do he explain how resistance can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is difficult to imagine resistance in light of the ideological strangle-hold that the development discourse appears to have in poststructural accounts. Yet I agree with Scott that, " Although the ideological position of the wealthy is rarely challenged in public, we know from unguarded derisive commentary by the poor that they hardly find it convincing -- let alone hegemonic "( 1985 : 310). In poststructural accounts of development, resistance therefore comes across as a utopian afterthought, rather than a real opportunity to shape social processes. <p> Ferguson does show the real effects of rural development initiatives in Lesotho. He also provides an insightful discussion of how the Thaba-Tseka Development Project was altered and manipulated by local actors, especially provincial bureaucrats. Yet like other development critics, his focus remains the World Bank as an institution and on the development discourse. Ferguson shows how Lesotho is constructed by the development agency as an underdeveloped nation : <p> Lesotho can be represented in " development " discourse as a nation of farmers, not wage laborers ; a country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but no classes ; values, but no structures ; administrators, but no ruler ; bureaucracy, but no politics( 1994 : 66). <p> Ferguson argues that " developers " seek to depoliticize the nature and consequences of their projects. As a result, development projects facilitate the extension of state power into previously autonomous regions of Lesotho. Without discussing resistance, however, Ferguson leaves the impression that this attempt to conceal the political realities of development goes unchallenged by local populations. I argue that it is not through mystifying development as a science that power is achieved, but rather through the implementation of projects that suit the interests of state or local actors, and through the resistance to such projects on the part of the target groups. In other words, those who push for development programs and strategies( especially national elites) may seek to present them as neutral, scientific, and outside of political conflicts, but few people will actually perceive them as such. <p> Crush 's edited volume Power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development and, similar to Escobar( who contributes to the volume), Sachs et al., and Ferguson, it focuses on language and discourse. However, the volume is also a valuable contribution to the growing body of Foucault-inspired analyses because it shows the considerable variation and disagreements within post-structuralist perspectives. The contributions of Cowen and Shenton, and Watts, are particularly significant because they historicize development, tracing the concept back at least to nineteenth-century positivists and eighteenth-century colonialists. They offer an appropriate corrective to Escobar( 1995a) and Sachs( 1992a), who imply that President Truman invented the idea in the Post-WWII years( Watts 1995 : 51). Many of the contributors also go further than other poststructuralists in bridging local and international contexts. On the whole, however, there is still too little sense of what development targets have to say. <p> Neither the activists nor the residents of eastern Bogot were fooled by the obvious attempts to deny the political and economic interests behind a series of development initiatives from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a worldview that presumed the standards set by the World Bank. It is hard to believe that people in Lesotho were any more disposed to view themselves as the Bank did. Elites in Bogot work as hard as they do to deny the politics behind their versions of sustainable development, for example, precisely because past experience has taught them how quickly political conflicts and social movements can entangle their programs and derail the entire process. In an effort to show how development works as a discourse that shapes limited alternatives, critics have presented a one-sided view of power and hegemony, while understating and/or romanticizing the role of local and national actors. In such a view, the local is overwhelmed by distant institutions and their discourses and any sense of the dialectical relationship between local and extra-local forces is lost. In the case of sustainable development, however, we can see that the language of environmental sustainability is no longer controlled merely by the World Commission on Development and Environment, but rather is being continually appropriated and transformed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Development " <p> Since the World Commission on Environment and Development issued the Bruntland Report in 1987, sustainable development has been on the lips of policy makers and planners throughout the developed and developing worlds. According to the commission, this new strategy, " seeks to meet the needs and aspirations of the present without compromising the ability to meet those of the future "( World Commission on Development and Environment 1987 : 40). Sustainable development, then, promises to manage the environment and sustain growth, as the two goals must now be reconciled : " Development can not subsist upon a deteriorating environmental resource base ; the environment can not be protected when growth leaves out of account the costs of environmental destruction "( 1987 : 37).( n14) <p> Economic growth and ecology must be linked in development thinking, not only because resources must be maintained for future generations, but also because policy makers blame poverty for much environmental degradation. By eliminating poverty through economic growth, then, environmental destruction will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion of Third World cities : <p> Few city governments in the developing world have the power, resources, and trained staff to provide their rapidly growing populations with the land, services, and facilities needed for an adequate human life : clean water, sanitation, schools, and transport. The result is mushrooming illegal settlements with primitive facilities, increasing overcrowding, and rampant disease linked to an unhealthy environment( 1987 : 238).( n15) <p> While suggesting that sustainable development will promote social equity, there is also a subtle message in the sustainable development discourse that poverty, and the poor, are to blame for much environmental degradation. This is especially true, and not particularly subtle, in the case of the urban poor, and seems to have gone remarkably unchallenged by advocates of sustainable development( see, for example, Haughton and Hunter 1994 : 17, 26). This assessment of blame would be amplified by urban elites in Colombia who charge the poor with the loss of the city 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue that the tom to environment is simply the latest attempt to sustain growth and manage the Third World. Wolfgang Sachs asserts that, <p> While environment was originally advanced to put development polities under indictment, it is now raised like a banner to announce a new era of development. Indeed, after " ignorance " and " poverty " in previous decades, " survival of the planet " is likely to become that well publicized emergency of the 1990s, in whose name a new frenzy of development will be unleashed( 1992a : 26 ; see also Sachs 1993). <p> Similarly, Escobar perceptively points out that, " It is growth( read : capitalist market expansion), and not the environment, that has to be sustained "( 1995a : 196). For Escobar, little has changed at the level of discourse, and sustainable development is just a new way of maintaining the development regime : <p> It is still assumed that the benevolent( white) hand of the West will save the Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank, mediated by Gro Harlem Bruntland, the matriarch scientist, and a few cosmopolitan Third Worlders who made it to the World Commission, to reconcile " humankind " with " nature. " The Western scientist continues to speak for the Earth. God forbid that a Peruvian peasant, an African nomad, or a rubber tapper of the Amazons should have something to say in this regard( 1995a : 193-194). <p> For Escobar, sustainable development is simply the continuation of the West 's efforts to rationalize, control, and manage the Third World. In this argument, women, peasants, and non-whites are excluded as agents of change, and the West is a monolith of white men, along with a few marginalized tokens of diversity. This is a compelling argument, but it obscures the complexity of the development encounter and portrays " subject peoples " as powerless and voiceless. This will be explored through a brief discussion of the use of sustainable development in Bogot. <p> Sustainable Development in Bogot <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has long been a symbol of the city and its standard postcard image. As the city spread north and west in this century, the large estates of the sabana( high plain) were sold to developers. The workers on those estates were left to live in the eastern hills, which were considered worthless to developers because of their inaccessibility and the difficulty of bringing services to the higher elevations. Others arrived in the eastern barrios over the years, mostly coming from the Boyaca region. <p> Though there are many differences between neighborhoods, principally in terms of their history and legal status, the barrios share the characteristics of do-it-yourself housing, inadequate services, and gradual improvement of both through the formation of neighborhood committees.( n16) Since the 1970s and 1980s when a major road was constructed through the area, the cerros orientales( eastern hills) have been the focus of intense competition on the part of land speculators, urban planners, politicians, and the workers who had made the hills their home. Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informal settlements " of the eastern hills, lie some of the city 's wealthiest residential neighborhoods, home to influential business leaders, senators, and ex-presidents. These wealthy residents fear their neighbors and view the neighborhoods in the hills as chaotic, an embarrassing sign of the country 's underdevelopment. <p> Residents living in these neighborhoods, which appear to cling to the hillsides of eastern Bogot, view the area quite differently. They see their neighborhoods as the product of long years of struggle, community effort, organized resistance, and sacrifice. Residents of El Paraso, a legally settled neighborhood of do-it-yourself housing which has struggled for years to get basic services such as electricity, water, and paved roads from the government, are fond of saying that their barrio should be called El Infierno( " hell, " rather than " paradise ") because of the sacrifices they have made to settle the area. When the city government has failed to provide services, residents have taken the initiative themselves, installing an aqueduct in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or tapping into nearby power lines. Young men have been electrocuted in the process of tapping these lines, and to the barrios they are martyrs, not thieves. <p> The pride that residents take in their neighborhoods is bittersweet, because they are pressured to move out of the area, especially those without legal rifle, and because they are constantly being told by the government and media that they are temporary, worthless, and even invisible. In the technical, and apparently neutral, language of government planning, the eastern barrios are variously described as " clandestine, " " sub-normal, " or " spontaneous. " Nothing of the long years of tenure and work improving the settlements is acknowledged in such accounts and residents resent such portrayals. As a result of such denials of the legitimacy of the eastern barrios, residents live in a state of perpetual limbo and uncertainty. In such situations it becomes difficult for residents to move forward, plan for the future, and build more permanent( brick) housing. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and contradictory concept, its manifestations in Bogot are even less precise.( n17) Terms such as " sustainable development, " " biodiversity, " and " participatory planning " are thrown about in discussions with planners and civic leaders as if their meaning were clear and uncontested. In such conversations proponents of projects that are labeled " sustainable " gloss over the contradictions of urban inequalities and conflicting interests( see Redclift and Goodman 1991 : 4-6 ; see also Redclift 1987). Sustainable development has allowed private interest groups and policy makers alike the opportunity to imagine a way to preserve the beauty of the eastern hills, while allowing for " selective development "( apartments for the wealthy surrounded by urban parks) and eliminating the settlements which are viewed as the refuge of the dangerous classes.( n18) Urban elites have imported and rewritten the language of sustainable development and participatory planning for their own purposes, while local residents in the hills have blocked attempts to exclude them from the planning process or expropriate their homes.( n19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have begun to draw up sustainable development plans for the eastern hills. The Corporacin de los Cerros, or the Corporation for the Hills, is one such initiative. The Corporation is a private interest group, made up of prominent residents of the posh northeast, which hopes to limit urbanization in the hills by purchasing land in the area and creating an " ecological park. " Since 1993 the Corporation has sought foreign funding from European organizations including the Metropolis Foundation, a French organization interested in urban environmental management. The organizers ' ability to attract funding rests on their assertion that the mountains are an ecologically unique area and important to the physical well-being of the city. In a 1993 interview Corporation Director Patricia Tones told me, " The only reason that we are not going to become a Mexico City so quickly is that we have this lung, the hills. We have that gold mine there beside such a monster of a city. " <p> The most ambitious project to date to limit growth in the hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly created local planning board for the district of Chapinero, or the JAL( Junta Administradora Local). The Plan for the Physical Regulation of the Eastern Zone( Plan de Ordenamiento Fisico Para la Zona Oriental) is an attempt to reduce the size of low-income or " subnormal " settlements in the hills and regulate future development through zoning, favoring low-density housing( inevitably, for the wealthy) and protected forest reserves in areas of " unstable terrain. "( n20) The JAL was created as a result of the 1991 Colombian Constitution, which mandated decentralization and local participation in planning decisions. <p> Most voters in the Chapinero district of Bogot are upper-middle class and wealthy residents, and the representatives they elected to the local planning board reflect that fact.( n21) While the board members come from the wealthiest sections of Chapinero, their fast project targeted what they considered to be Chapinero 's urban blight, the eastern hills. The plan, and its advocates, evoke images of the mountains as the " lungs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mantra that the Amazon is the " lungs of the world, " in order to support their claims on the future development of the area.( n22) Such language allows urban environmental problems to be conceptually tied to global sustainability.( n23) I agree with postructuralists that this rhetoric allows for interventions and denies political interests( see Sachs 1992b). I disagree, however, with the assumption that this intervention is generated primarily at the international level. Poststructuralists tend to ignore the fact that the discourse gets coopted and reworked by local actors with their own interests. As even the proponents of sustainable development admit, the term is vague and easily manipulated as a " political mantra "( Haughton and Hunter 1994 : 21 ; see also Bartelmus 1994 : 69). <p> Despite the mandate of broad participation, the JAL board has made little effort to include the concerns of residents who would be most affected by the initiative. This has not stopped the JAL from making claims of inclusion in their planning reports in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support of the city administration. <p> Tree Saplings Wrapped in Dollar Bills : The JAL Plan <p> The cover of the Phase Two report of the JAL Plan is astonishing in its blatant recognition of the symbolic capital of appeals to environmental sustainability. The cover includes a picture of tree saplings wrapped in US dollar bills. This recognition of the power of environmental claims on the part of planners is matched by their appreciation for the value of the eastern hills as real estate. Throughout the JAL project documents, there is the sense that the potential of the land in the hills over Chapinero is not being fully realized. The planners suggest that with the " consolidation " of the existing poor barrios, new lands can be opened to development.( n24) According to the Phase One study, over half of the land( 55 percent) is heavily forested and too steep for development, making it a kind of de facto forest reserve. Over half of the land suitable for construction is still open to future development, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the area and defining its future growth. As one of the JAL board members( ediles), Jaime Concha, told me in a 1993 interview, <p> I think it is an extremely valuable area. Only 30 percent of it is invasion, let 's say, or low-income barrios. So therefore, the remaining 70 percent can be organized, and you can do something logical with it. <p> In a letter from Jaime Concha and another board member, Jose Felix Estrada, to the Director of Planning for the city of Bogot, the assertion that zoning in the hills will benefit the health of the entire city is reiterated : " We believe that the area can still be saved for the future of the city. " <p> The goal of the JAL plan, stated in the Phase I report, is " the incorporation of an area of excellent location and enormous potential into the development of the district of Chapinero "( JAL 1993a : no page numbers). The report goes on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the area to the preservation of natural resources in the area, especially the preservation of important water sources and forested areas. The contradiction between these two goals, as well as the contradicting class interests in the area, are not addressed. The project report recommends a mixture of conservation of some areas with a " selective development " of other lands. The Phase II report calls this option " sustained development. " While it is politically impossible to remove squatters or low-income settlements from the area by force, the report reasons, market forces themselves will lead to a " consolidation "( that is, reduction) of poor neighborhoods in the area. The low population density that proponents say wealthy housing and careful zoning will achieve is the key to their claims of the project 's environmental sustainability. <p> The need for logical, rational planning, and a sense of order, are themes that run through both the JAL documents, as well as interviews I conducted in 1993 with those involved in the plan. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be " recovered " or integrated into the development of the city and of the district of Chapinero. Why is the idea of recovering the hills so important? Precisely because the local elite feels that it has lost control of the area, which it now recognizes to be of great value. Luis Fernando Castro, district president( Alcalde Menor) of Chapinero, clearly states that the goal of the plan was " the recovery recuperacin of the area. "( n25) When I asked what he meant by " recuperacin, " he said, <p> When you go by there you can visually see the chaos. So, " recuperar " means to organize, to take away the chaos, so that it functions as it should socially, and that it has at least the minimum conditions. <p> Castro and others view the neighborhoods seen from the highway as chaotic and out of place in the posh northeast. <p> Elvira Cuervo de Jaramillo, the director of the private organization that was hired to draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recuperar in the development report in terms of ecological preservation : " To replant, to clean. that is what ' recuperar ' means, in environmental terms. When you see that an area has been pillaged, you have to return it to the service of the community. " Despite the neutral language of improved living conditions and environmental preservation, the use of the term " recuperar "( to recover) also suggests the desire to take control of an area that has fallen into disarray and chaos by the spread of unchecked " slums. " Moreover, no plans for regeneration of native species or reforestation is included in the report( see below). As the use of the term " recuperar " suggests, the report reflects the assumption that poor barrios are bad for the environment, and that the mountains are too valuable to allow them to be taken over by slums. For example, the Phase Two report states : <p> The areas of clandestine settlements are highly consolidated, have the necessary legal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an urban and socio-economic phenomenon that causes similar settlements to develop on surrounding lands, with the obvious risks of environmental deterioration and degradation for the area emphasis added.( n26) <p> The assumption that " clandestine " settlements are inherently bad for the environment masks a more complex set of factors. The settlement of the hills has caused a great deal of soil erosion and contamination of streams. However, what the plan fails to point out is that paved roads, proper drainage systems, and regular garbage service in the barrios could go a long way toward solving these problems. Moreover, the massive construction projects for luxury housing, and the highways and pollution brought by that development, have a far greater environmental impact.( n27) Nonetheless, the reports reflect an underlying assumption that wealthy settlements despite their greater per capita consumption of resources, are more " eco-friendly. " Ecology, presumed geological risks, and market forces offer three possibilities for the " consolidation " of the existing settlements in the hills, and three potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> District and city government efforts to control the growth of the eastern hills seems to rest largely on their assertion that the mountains are an ecologically unique area and important to the physical well-being of the city. For example, Elizabeth Rodado, the director of the city government environmental office refers to the hills as the " lungs of Bogot. " Why are the mountains the lungs of Bogot? According to Rodado, <p> The fast thing is that the quality of life will deteriorate if we do n't have the eastern hills. The second reason is that there is definitely an important wealth of bio-diversity, in pramo, in flora, in fauna.( n28) <p> Like the description of the mountains as the lungs of the city, the emphasis on the area 's biodiversity is both strategic and misleading. In fact, the eastern hills were completely deforested by the late nineteenth century( Carrizosa Umaa 1989). The forests in the hills today are second growth, and primarily non-native species, such as pine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topography of the area. <p> Like Rodriguez Azuero, who admits that the effects of the JAL plan on the residents of the hills is likely to be unfortunate, Rodado argues that the prevention of future poor settlements in the hills is crucial to preserving the ecology of the area for the benefit of all Bogotanos. Rodado describes the settlements in the eastern hills, echoing the stereotypes that middle-class and wealthy Bogotanos hold about the eastern barrios : <p> What we see in the hills are quarries, areas of deforestation, areas where people are robbed, where you ca n't go for a walk because they will attack you, where who knows how many people have been killed, on the highway alone. But this is all because there is not management and control, and because people do n't realize the importance of the hills.( n29) <p> Interspersed with her commentary on the ecological aspects of the area, Rodado 's comments reveal the fear of many elites living in the north -- that " dangerous " neighborhoods are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the refuge of thieves and outlaws : <p> If we let the squatter settlements advance and continue as they are, we are obviously going to have a terrible problem for the city, because we are going to have a Ciudad Bolvar on the eastern side of Bogot, completely eroded, where the topsoil is very fragile, as fragile as an eggshell.( n30) <p> Such statements reflect the fear of massive slums in the backyard of the city 's rich and powerful which underlies apparently neutral discussions of soil erosion and environmental degradation. <p> ' A No Dejarnos Fregar ' : Popular Responses to Development, 1972-1994 <p> The JAL plan appropriates the language of popular development trends -- sustainable development, community participation -- to drum up support and funding for their project. However, organizers are vague about what they understand these concepts to mean, especially in reference to the eastern hills and what they want to do there. Behind the references to such trends are more deep-rooted assumptions about the nature of development, the place of poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. While projects promising eco-parks and sustainable development may play well to international and national agencies and lend legitimacy to the efforts of elites to force the poor from the eastern hills, local residents find such language a thin mask which disguises little. Because the plan is still in the early stages, the full response on the part of the eastern barrios is not yet known. However, the response thus far and the response to other development initiatives in the area in past years suggests that the barrios will organize to force the organizations involved to recognize their interests. <p> The residents of the eastern hills have engaged in a long history of resisting and redirecting development efforts in the area. In the early 1970s a highway project through the eastern hills, the grand Avenida de los Cerros, funded in part by the Inter-American Development Bank, threatened to force low-income residents out of the area through proposed expropriations and a flurry of land speculation( see Gilbert 1978 ; Everett 1995). The plan was touted by the mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the east of the highway from future development. It was clear to the residents of the eastern barrios that the road would provide a link between the burgeoning wealthy suburbs to the north of the city and the downtown government and business districts. It was also clear to residents that the road implied the expropriation and eviction of hundreds of families, many of whom had no legal title to their land. <p> The plan was not only rejected by local residents, with the assistance of priests and student activists, but it touched off a massive social movement that focused a city-wide debate on urban development. While politicians promised that the highway would " integrate " poor areas into the city and denied any political or economic motivations behind the project, residents resisted the proposal as a road for the wealthy and as a threat to their homes. <p> Residents of the eastern barrios responded by forming Comits Prodefensa, or local defense committees. Neighborhood committees eventually joined together to form a network of well-informed, well-organized opposition to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement from the San Martin barrio, explained the purpose of the committees in a 1993 interview : " That was so that we would unite all the barrios, because we were resolved not to let ourselves be mistreated a no dejarnos fregar. And it was very useful. " Women were especially active in the movement. This was particularly true in the Mariscal Sucre neighborhood, where a group of women became known as " the three Maras. " The women were regarded for their tenacity and obstinacy. Perhaps because of their role as protectors of family and home, their public roles and aggressive tactics were encouraged and admired rather than discouraged by the men. One of the most poignant events of the movement was a mock burial of the highway, held at a community center in 1973, in which the development project was represented as a coffin into which dozens of activists placed letters of protest. <p> For priests involved in the movement, it was a chance to apply the admonitions of liberation theology, emerging at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their daily struggles. For student activists and Marxists, it was a chance to decry the neocolonialism of foreign-supported development and to situate the conflicts of rapid urbanization within the context of class struggle. The residents of the neighborhoods saw through the government 's rhetoric of development as integration( President Misael Pastrana 1970-1974 often touted the development program as a way to do away with " the two cities, " that is, the division between the modern metropolis and the impoverished periphery) and allied with priests, students, and Marxist opposition leaders in an effort to save their homes and neighborhoods from bulldozers and land-speculators. <p> Whatever the true demise of the highway, the residents continue to believe that they buried the project through their collective opposition. The importance of this history for understanding present responses to sustainable development in the area is that the movement against the Avenida de los Cerros created a group of leaders and organizers in the area as well as organizational networks that can be quickly mobilized to confront new development initiatives that may threaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the movement have sustained a suspicion of development and clientalist rhetoric from politicians. While residents of the eastern barrios share many of the development aspirations of the wealthy and middle classes, they are quick to examine how government projects and policies will effect them and to reject the simple rhetoric of integration. Their own notions of development are commonly expressed as a desire to move forward, salir adelante, a term they frequently use when discussing goals for the family, including education, better housing, and services. Many people I spoke with while living and interviewing in the hills used the expression " sacar pa ' adelante a los nios, " by which they meant both the task of raising their children as well as providing them with new and better opportunities than they had. Such statements obviously share much with government rhetoric of progress and middle-class values, but they are also often accompanied by skepticism about government programs that claim to help them. As Pigg argues in her study of Nepalese villagers, people may resist specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> As a result of mismanagement, political entanglements with opposition parties, and the social movement against the highway, the road was never built as planned. In the 1980s a scaled-down version of the road was built, the Avenida Circunvalar, and again residents organized to assure that any expropriated land would be fully compensated. As a result of pressure and collective action from the barrios, all displaced families received compensation, even those who had no legal title to the land. As with the first effort to construct a highway, residents of the hills did not accept the government 's justification for the road as a symbol of progress and development. Rather, they view it as a symbol of wealthy excess and the costly intrusion of the government, one that they were forced to support with their property taxes. Teresa Daz, whose house stands just above the highway in the barrio of El Paraiso, commented to me in 1993, " They had the Avenida for the rich, who pass by with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay the taxes for the road almost never use that road. " Luis Montaa, a young leader in San Martn, believes that the city government was determined to build a road for wealthy commuters : <p> After the Avenida de los Cerros failed was when they invented the Avenida Circunvalar. They -- the state -- just could n't accept the fact that they could n't carry out a huge project like that, where the poor would pay the price for easing the traffic for the fat eats in the north los mantecos del norte, right? They invented the Avenida de los Cerros, which for them was like the ultimate. And they could sleep a little more.but everything fell through. Then they invented the Avenida Circunvalar. <p> The response thus far to attempts at sustainable development in the eastern hills has been similar. Residents bemoan the growth of wealthy housing in the area, which not only threatens their tenure, but has altered the landscape that they love. Rosa Rincn Tangua, of the barrio Bosque Caldern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the incursions of apartment buildings for the wealthy as " Just like the countryside, and nobody gave us any trouble "( Todo un campo, y naiden nos amargaba la vida). <p> When leaders from several eastern barrios met with Jaime Rodriguez Azuero, the director of the Taller Local, about the JAL plan in July 1993, local residents confronted Rodriguez and challenged his claim of " participatory planning. " In a meeting arranged by a lawyer who helps represent the barrios in land disputes, residents berated Rodriguez for failing to include them in the planning process. Rodriguez spoke nervously about the need to include the community in the development study. He explained, however, that including the participation of the community too soon could affect the methodology of the study, and might bring undo political pressures to bear on the technical phases of the study. Nonetheless, in the Phase II report that he drafted for the JAL, he claims that " community representatives " were involved in the planning process from the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, encouraged from the beginning, allowed the study to go beyond the theoretical context "( JAL 1993b : unpaginated). It becomes clear reading the report that participation includes only government agencies, planners, and experts, and not those likely to be affected by the plan. This effort to depoliticize the issue of participation did not succeed in winning over the residents of the eastern hills. One leader from Los Olives said during the meeting, <p> I feel that once again they have pulled a fast one on us nos volvieron a hacer un golazo, and that we did n't have anything to say about it. It is not clear what you all were going to do to the barrios.. I think that this plan was very secretive. <p> Permanent neighborhood committees, or Juntas de Accin Comunal, throughout the eastern hills, continue to monitor the efforts of government and private groups to " develop " the hills. The residents ' vision of " integration " into the city is the extension of services such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently cable and satellite TV), not the incursion of government management and control, which they continue to resist. <p> Conclusions <p> Recent critical works in anthropology about development have provided new insights into the way in which development works as a powerful discourse to shape how we perceive social change. If they have shown development to be a regime of representation, however, they have largely failed to reveal the agents of this repressive system. By leaving out or simplifying agency, they portray development as both more unified and more powerful than it is. In their vision of development without subjects, poststructuralist critics also portray agents as largely unaware of the social processes in which they are caught. Yet, while the consequences of development may often be unintended and misunderstood by those involved, this fact does not mean that conscious actions and motivations have no role in shaping development interventions. <p> By imagining resistance to be the answer to the " development nightmare " without defining resistance or looking at in-depth examples, they provide a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, without ever defining what those alternatives might be. In Bogot, development, and its current manifestation, sustainable development, is not only a discourse imposed by the World Bank, but a powerful tool imported and rewritten by local and national elites. While development projects may afford local governments and national elites great powers to pursue their interests, the extension of state management and control does not go unchallenged by development 's targets who play a vital role in shaping the development encounter. <p> Local governmental and non-governmental agencies have taken advantage of the vague nature of the sustainable development concept and applied the term to projects that have no clear environmental agenda. Rather, ecological claims as well as those of broad participation in planning seem to be an attempt to disguise political and economic interests, to win government approval and in some cases foreign funding. In the eastern hills of Bogot the motivation seems to be the " consolidation " of marginal settlements made visible by a 1980s highway project. The highway is a symbol of progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in northeastern Bogot, while the barrios are seen as a threat and an unpleasant sign of underdevelopment. The residents of the barrios in the hills, the " marginalized urban poor, " have long challenged elite visions of development as highways and eco-parks and continue to pursue their own visions of development. <p>
