4008341 Section : LITIGATION <p> Like any good defense lawyer, Lisa B. Kemler knew the facts were against her client. Lorena Bobbitt had mutilated her husband. <p> Kemler 's only hope was to convince jurors that Bobbitt, too, was a victim. After years of abuse and intimidation by men, she had finally lost control and struck back. It was an argument any good defense lawyer could make. <p> But as the trial progressed, Kemler of Moffitt, Zwerling and Kemler in Alexandria, Va., made the argument only a female lawyer could make without saying a word. <p> The male prosecutor had been steadily challenging her with technical objections. For a female lawyer arguing that her female client had struggled in a world dominated by men, it was the perfect opportunity. Kemler looked at the female jurors and rolled her eyes, as if to say, " Is n't that just like a man? " <p> Whether Bobbitt escaped conviction because she had a female lawyer or because evidence showed she had given in to an irresistible impulse is one of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver their messages : Are some clients, arguments or jury pools so demographically loaded that they should be approached only by lawyers with compatible gender, ethnic or regional characteristics? <p> While prosecutor Paul Ebert, Virginia commonwealth attorney for Prince William County, had to take on Bobbitt 's female lawyer in court, he knew he could not win by destroying Bobbitt on the stand. " She had allegedly been beaten up so often by men that if we had stood up there and beat her up some more, I thought it would be counterproductive. " <p> The job of cross-examination went to Mary Grace O'Brien, a senior deputy. <p> The idea behind matching a lawyer to a case or situation is to send jurors a subliminal message about the client or to manipulate perceptions of race, sex, age or regional identity that shape their assessments of a lawyer 's demeanor. <p> Even though few lawyers want to acknowledge or discuss it, lawyer-matching is a time-honored tradition. The twist is that while it once might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or stereotype, it is now practiced as a way of putting clients or circumstances in the best light in a multicultural society. <p> Whether it is effective is a matter of debate. <p> Everyone knows that demographics can make a difference, says Harland Braun, a Los Angeles criminal defender in solo practice. <p> O.J. Simpson started his high-profile defense with three equally high-profile lawyers -- all white. Faced with trial in Los Angeles County where blacks, Hispanics and Asians dominate the jury pool, a fourth high-powered lawyer -- who is black -- was added. <p> Demographics, though, are " usually the least reliable predictor in jury selection, " and therefore, those factors should not be any more influential in attorney selection, according to Joyce M. Tsongas, a jury consultant in Portland, Ore. <p> The feeling is that the law ought to be an equal opportunity employer. <p> " The thing you need to look for in a lawyer is somebody who is comfortable in the courtroom and who engenders credibility, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can be a person of any age, of any sex, of any race. " <p> But human beings, including jurors and judges, react to others based on emotions and stereotypes. " No one wants to admit that because it sounds like discrimination, " Braun says. <p> It does not have to be. <p> " One of the reasons you have a diverse law firm is that it gives you resources to draw on to give the best representation to your client, " says Stanley D. Davis of the Kansas City, Mo., firm Stinson, Mag &; Fizzell, where he is a shareholder. Davis, a former law professor, cochairs the ABA Litigation Section 's Committee on Training the Advocate. <p> " A trial is like a play. You cast it, " says Stephen Gillers, a legal ethics professor at New York University School of Law. " You want quality lawyers, but you need to appeal to the local biases. " <p> Similarly, a trial team that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jurors ' unspoken doubts about a litigant 's motives in a case involving race or sex, says Karen Jo Koonan, a jury consultant with the National Jury Project in Oakland, Calif., a for-profit trial consulting firm. <p> But, Koonan cautions, " there is nothing worse than a jury feeling it has been manipulated. " <p> Others agree that jurors are not dumb ; they will not be fooled by symbolism. " Tokenism gets raised by the jury and used against you, " says former public defender William Moffitt, also a partner in Moffitt, Zwerling &; Kemler. " Having a black person in there is going to be seen as a ploy. <p> Some lawyers create a diverse team not only for its effect on a jury, but to help broaden their own perspective on a case. <p> For instance, when Gerald Chaleff, a Los Angeles criminal defense lawyer, got calls to defend Hillside Strangler Angelo Buono and one of the two Menendez brothers who were accused of killing their mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him. <p> " My theory on picking co-counsel is that I want someone who is different than I am. No matter how equal we like to think we are, we are socialized differently, " Chaleff says. Minority or female lawyers frequently bring perspectives from life experiences he lacks. <p> Los Angeles trial attorney Jill Lansing, who became lead counsel for Lyle Menendez 's first trial after Chaleff and another attorney withdrew, shares the belief. She wants defense teams to include men and women because some jurors relate better to men and some to women. Who makes the point to jurors can be as important as the argument itself, Lansing notes. <p> Another reason to include female and minority lawyers on a trial team is that they heighten juror interest simply by not being the expected white males, contends Beth Bonora, another National Jury Project consultant. That is especially true for women jurors, she says. " Women are very interested in : What does it mean to be a woman in the courtroom? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team or lawyer-client match may not provide a clear tactical advantage, it may remove some negatives. <p> The classic example is having a woman defend an accused rapist. <p> The theory is that jurors will feel that a woman would not want to work closely with a man who would commit such a crime against another woman. The lawyer-match message is that a defendant may be more trustworthy than dangerous. <p> Melinda Douglas, chief public defender in Alexandria, Va., sometimes likes to use all-female teams to defend male violent-crime suspects in an effort to humanize them. Sitting close to a defendant, leaning in to ask his opinion or putting a hand on his shoulder can work to deflect juror bias, she says. <p> Other lawyers take advantage of what they have in common with clients and jurors, often involving subtle forms of communication. That same process also can affect which lawyer cross-examines when it comes to vulnerable witnesses. <p> Alexandria lawyer Moffitt says he can talk to young, black, male defendants more easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his presentation to a jury. <p> Similarly, H.T. Smith, a Miami defense lawyer and president of the National Bar Association, knows he can connect with black jurors in South Florida. " The longer the trial is, the more opportunity people of like background have to have communications that the general population may not even realize are going on. " <p> When Smith represented one of six football players accused of sexually assaulting a woman in their hotel room, he used the same skills a white lawyer would have brought into the courtroom. But when he offered his closing argument, he shared with the primarily black jury an African-American folktale. They understood its message : Any woman who went to a hotel with six men at night knew why she had been invited. <p> Finding lawyers with sympathetic traits can be crucial in questioning witnesses who are vulnerable, especially female crime victims or children. <p> When a child is on the witness stand, " the last thing you want to show a jury is the appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-founder of Arnelle &; Hastie in Oakland. Do not give the task to " a hulking, 6-foot-5-inch guy, " he advises. This is partly for the child 's comfort and partly for the appearance of caring conveyed to the jury. <p> " You are also trying to represent your client, " Hastie stresses. In that type of situation, he would look for a " grandfatherly or grandmotherly " lawyer. <p> According to Peter Bennett, a lawyer with Herbert H. Bennett and Associates in Portland, Maine, a witness should be examined by whichever attorney will work best with that witness. <p> Bennett, chair of the ABA Torts and Insurance Practice Section 's Employer-Employee Relations Committee, says, " You 're trying to develop the right chemistry with the jury. " <p> Chemistry -- and demographics -- also matters when there are no juries, for instance before judges or outside of litigation. Judges, says public defender Douglas, may not be susceptible to drama like jurors, but they are not immune to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate law are instances in which attorney demographics may merit special attention. In fact, any case in which the sex, race or age of the parties is at issue may require consideration of those aspects in attorneys. <p> While there usually are no juries in divorce or custody cases, " the question of sex and how it is handled is extremely important, " says Donn C. Fullenweider of Fullenweider &; Wardell in Houston and co-chair of the ABA Family Law Section 's Committee on the Trial Advocacy Institute. <p> A family law firm should always consider how a judge responds to its various lawyers when assigning one to a case, Fullenweider says. " They may feel a certain judge is more inclined to listen to a male or a female, and that 's like any other decision the firm would make. " <p> Corporate defendants regularly ask whether they should have a woman or minority on the trial team, Bennett says. <p> Hastie says his presence as a black man softens the disadvantage his corporate and institutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as symbols of white, male domination. <p> Susan Willis, a labor lawyer in Tucson, Ariz., says having a female attorney can give more than the appearance of a psychological advantage with some jurors. For instance, in a sexual harassment suit, a woman might spot problems in a company 's actions and policies that a man might not. <p> Similarly, a company accused of wrongfully firing an older worker should go with experience for its lead attorney and avoid a young lawyer. " You 're implicitly making the other side 's case, " notes Davis. <p> But for lawyers prepared to argue the facts and the law, is demographic mix-and-match a strategy to fret? <p> " Whatever you are, you 've got ta play your hand, " says Braun, " and every sword is a double-edged sword.
