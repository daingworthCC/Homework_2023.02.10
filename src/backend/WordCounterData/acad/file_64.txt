4009941 Electronic Chicken Soup for Reluctant ESL Writers <p> Key words : ESL ; reading ; journals ; media literacy ; writing <p> Key words : ESL ; reading ; journals ; media literacy ; writing <p> Semester after semester in the first meeting of my undergraduate English as a Second Language( ESL) classes, the same scenario played out : I announce required weekly journals, and students roll their eyes while their body language shouts, " Oh no! Not journals again! " The signal was consistently dear that they disliked journal writing, and the first set of journals always reflected their dislike. With few exceptions, their journals were short, uninteresting, and written for the teacher in exchange for a grade or in compliance with the syllabus. Their entries were not critical ; they reflected no connection to the real world, no connection to their feelings, no connection to their lives. Instead, I found myself reading a string of superficial thoughts in a minimum number of sentences, sometimes as few as three or four. Several students expressed their frustration at not being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not see how the journals were helping them learn the target language. Students perceived journal writing as an isolated activity relevant only to their final grade, not an integrated part of their ESL learning experience. <p> The experience was equally frustrating for me as a language instructor because I expected the journal requirement to help students to write more readily and to increase their fluency, but that was not happening. The disconnect was obvious and formidable. Over time however, I learned that the problem was understandable and, best of all, resolvable. <p> The literature on learning and on writing contains much to explain why such a popular strategy as journal writing was not working in my classroom. Mayher( 1990), for example, explains the need for students to connect with what they write so that it is meaningful to them : <p> The motivation for performing the tasks which will lead to the learning has to be a sense of personal meaningfulness for the learner.... Human beings are active meaning makers who are continually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own purposes. This idea of personal knowledge... provides a radical challenge to the student 's personal connections to the material being learned and of his individual reasons to be learning it.( 78,104) <p> In her text exploring the uses of journal writing for second language learners, Mlynarczyk( 1998) agrees with Mayher and explores the implications of his stance : <p> One of the reasons why school writing feels so alien to many people is the stated or unstated injunction not to express feelings or emotions about the topic. Yet if Mayher is correct, this prohibition is based on a false assumption. Our feelings are always intertwined with our thoughts, and we would probably be better thinkers and writers if we were allowed or even encouraged to admit this.( 30) <p> As it turns out, I learned that it was that lack of personal meaning that was undermining my journal assignments. In her book Finding Freedom In The Classroom, Hinchey( 2001) reinforces the point : " Everything about traditional methodology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to such methodology largely because of its focus on texts( the ' subject matter ' of the course) and its parallel disregard of students ' humanity. In opposition, she argued that if students were to learn anything of use in the literature classroom, their own experience and background had to be the central concern in any effective pedagogy "( 76). <p> When my curiosity led me to ask students to write about their experiences with journals, most of them related negative experiences that clearly lacked the kind of personal connection to writing that many theorists stress is essential to learning. Among the reasons the students mentioned for their resistance to journals were lack of interest in assigned topics( usually on abortion, alcohol, crime, or drug abuse) ; running out of words or thoughts ; writer 's block ; being unable to " get into " what they read ; dislike of reading, and lack of enthusiasm for related writing -- a litany that all language instructors have heard many times. In addition, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their ideas. Hearing such student complaints, I understood why they had rolled their eyes. <p> Still, I strongly believed that weekly journal writing could help my students develop their writing skills, and so I began experimenting with different strategies to engage the students with their writing. I tried linking their journal entries to class discussions on a certain topic or to a reading done in class. Another strategy I tried was to give them such prompts as : " I 'll never forget when... a or " I 'll always remember the first time that.... " Those strategies worked for some students, but many others continued to find it difficult to express themselves in their journal entries. <p> As their instructor, my frustration continued to grow. Every semester, I encountered several problems with the journals -- they were too short, difficult to read, and difficult to understand. Some students copied their journals from roommates or friends in previous courses( probably thinking they had nothing original or authentic to write about) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaging short stories, but aside from the fact that it took time to find good stories that would appeal to the group, the strategy raised two new hurdles. I could not infringe on copyright law, and I had a low monthly quota for photocopying even if I could navigate around copyright issues. I tried recycling stories used in previous years, but that only fomented the plagiarizing of previous students ' journals. When I shared my frustration with a colleague, she admitted that her students also showed apathy toward journal writing. This worried me, but I refused to stop searching for new ways to make journal writing a meaningful experience. I firmly believed that if students would engage with journal writing, they would become better writers. Like so many classroom colleagues, who suffer similar frustrations, I was determined not to abandon a worthwhile learning strategy until I had found a way to make it work for my students. <p> The answer eventually came from a professional development seminar in a motivational session on self-esteem. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desk, crossed her legs, and began reading a story to participants. I found her behavior unusual but soon forgot its strangeness because the story was so beautiful. The speaker captivated her audience ; when she asked if we wanted another story, everyone agreed. She read two more stories, with the effect that total strangers in the audience sitting next to each other were soon laughing and finding things to share with one another. It was dear that everyone loved the stories. They were short and very interesting. They sparked discussion, laughter, tears, motivation -- all types of emotions. When the conference concluded, I asked the speaker for the source of the stories. She showed me the book Chicken Soup for the Woman 's Soul( 1996), by Mark Victor Hansen and Jack Canfield, one of several books in the Chicken Soup series. <p> I realize that many readers may have a negative reaction to a book that comes from the widely disparaged self-help genre. I believe, however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may find them. I wanted to give my students the experience of immediate engagement that I had witnessed at the seminar. After I purchased the book, I read it in two nights, stopping often to share the stories and my emotional reactions with my husband. If only, I thought, my ESL students could read the stories, they also would have comments to share with each other. This could be an opportunity to provide my students with a variety of short stories -- but how could I make it work? <p> I could not ask them to buy an additional book that was not even a textbook. Again I faced the hurdle of copyright law ; I could not photocopy the stories and hand them out. So, I continued buying books in the series and reading the stories, marking several stories that I thought might interest my students. When I began reading those stories to the class and having the students write reactions in class, I saw a stark contrast to their regular journal writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from the brief and stilted journal entries. They were not writing for me ; they were speaking to themselves and reflecting on the story they had heard. I found the results amazing because the activity itself was so simple. Excited by their response, I decided to read them a story every week. They began looking forward to the activity and produced consistently superior writing -- longer pieces with a much wider range of vocabulary. Even more encouraging to me, they began without prompting to bring their bilingual dictionaries and to ask for translations to English, the better to express their thoughts. I liked what was happening but still wanted them to tackle the stories themselves and to practice reading in English with the new enthusiasm they had for their writing. The key to that expansion came when I learned that Chicken Soup stories are available online -- an example of computers significantly expanding educational resources, just as technology enthusiasts so often claim and classroom educators too rarely experience. I learned that free Chicken Soup for the Soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, only on weekends) by e-mail to anyone who registers at < www.chickensoup.com>. I seized the opportunity to get this engaging reading material to my students. <p> Were there problems with start up? Of course. Not all students had access to a computer, and most of them did not have an e-mail account. Also, I needed to do some tinkering to figure out the best way to incorporate the short stories into the class. I eventually decided to open each class with a five-to-ten minute discussion of the material, which encouraged students who had not done the reading to be better prepared for subsequent classes. Many of the discussions produced ideas that students then explored at length in their journals. Students ' Response to the Activity <p> I have routinely asked students for their recommendations about this activity, in large part to be sure I was not the only one thinking it was such a great thing. Other educators have been surprised to find student reaction to a class activity is far less positive than theirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his experience using Robert Frost 's " Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening, " which he selected because he liked it and understood it. He could not, however, get a discussion going in his class. Eventually, he realized that what he " assumed would be easy and accessible was exotic and opaque " to his California students who had never seen snow( 5). Indeed, students ' background and experiences do matter. An instructor 's judgment is not necessarily more reliable with pop culture than it is with the canon. As Alvermann, Moon, and Hagood( 1999) point out, <p> Teachers who use popular culture texts in their classrooms may not assume anything about their students ' knowledge and taste. The practical implication to be gleaned from this is that any informed decision about selecting curriculum materials or popular culture texts for literacy lessons must be made in collaboration with the students.( 44) <p> Understanding what my students thought about their learning with the activity was more important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> My students ' feedback indicates that the activity not only met my initial goals of getting them more engaged with reading and writing to gain fluency in the language, but it also yielded several other benefits. A short list of the learning opportunities they valued and enjoyed included learning to use the computer( e-mail, Internet, and interactive class) ; sharing their writing with each other ; learning new vocabulary ; increasing their reading speed ; and enjoying reading for pleasure. <p> Because the stories deal with real-life situations, students often could use their own life experiences to assess a character 's choices. In their evaluations, many mentioned that the stories gave them something to ponder and reported that they often went over and over the stories, thinking through which one they most wanted to write about. Sometimes they wrote about two of the readings because it was so difficult to choose one. In these entries, they wrote about fear, courage, love, life, death, hope, and their experiences. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " take advantage of the student 's experience... establish an ' intimate ' connection between knowledge considered basic to any school curriculum and knowledge that is the fruit of the lived experience of these students as individuals "( 1998,36). In their journal entries, the students talked to themselves and asked questions about what they had read and about their own realities. <p> Moreover, the students also pointed out that they actually looked forward to reading a new online story every day. The enjoyment of getting something new by e-mail every day helped them view reading as a pleasurable activity. Smith( 1997) anticipated that outcome : <p> Why will people read online? For precisely the same reasons that they already read-for pleasure, information, identification, and experience.... The new possibilities could well result in even more reading, both obligatory and voluntary. Reading is addictive to many people, computers are addictive to many people, and the combination of reading and computers prove irresistible, just as many people are already addicted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musing esoterically among the entrails of computers themselves.( 143-44) <p> Having developed that addiction, my students displayed their newfound interest in reading in interesting and exciting ways. <p> Several of the more advanced students informed me that they had registered for a literature class the following semester because they were no longer afraid of reading and wanted something more challenging, such as English or British literature and perhaps later Shakespeare or Mythology. Other students bought copies of Chicken Soup for the Soul to read, and some purchased them in Spanish as gifts for their parents, siblings, friends, or loved ones. For the first time, they were reading for pleasure and feeling the desire to share that new experience with others, especially those closest to them. A couple of students brought their books to class and proudly told me how quickly they had read them and that they were interested in exchanging them with students who had other Chicken Soup titles. Not surprisingly, because we know the benefits of active engagement with processing language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the reading in other courses easier. <p> The students ' interest in thinking about and discussing the stories also helped them engage in critical thinking. The online stories stimulated the students ' curiosity ; they wanted to read a new story everyday, compare and contrast it with others they had read, consider it in the light of their own experience, define their own stance, and explore their point of view with their peers. Because of the high level of interest, the whole class engaged in discussing the stories at the beginning of the class, so that they were improving their verbal skills as well. The informal discussions began as soon as a few students arrived in the classroom, even if I was not there. <p> I was particularly gratified at the transformation in the students ' attitude toward writing and the improvement evident in their writing. Even though students wrote about the same story, each journal was unique because of the writer 's experiences, beliefs, and expectations. They also became interested readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact, the class changed from a group of reluctant learners to a community of readers and writers. I found the students comforting each other, congratulating themselves, and laughing among themselves at experiences that they shared about childhood or adolescence. As I watched them grow together as a group and share their experiences of the world, I realized that the class was not about English but about life, with the English language being an instrument to move them ahead to reach their goals. <p> Their writing skills improved significantly. They used richer vocabulary, probably because they were searching for words to explain their emotions and experiences in situations similar to those in the stories. They also exhibited much greater fluency. I remember reading several papers in which the students apologized for the length of their writing, which they wrote because they had something important to say. The length per entry increased from four or five sentences to two or three pages. Short choppy sentences with little or no transitions from early in the semester grew to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked to make the relationships between their ideas clear in their writing. One memorable example of the enormous growth came from a young woman who wrote about her several years ' struggle with anorexia and bulimia and the suffering that she and her family experienced. Her fourteen-page effort allowed her some relief from an issue that had haunted her for years, and it was a compelling story. When journal writing became a way to explore, analyze, and discuss issues important in their own lives, my students became less fearful of writing and began to view it as a tool for articulating their own humanity. <p> Given those benefits and accomplishments, I found the students ' problems with the process manageable. Some students still felt the need for the scaffolding of traditional prompts( What do you think about this story? How can you relate to the reading? What would you have done? Did you like/dislike the reading? Do you agree or disagree with what happened? Does it have to be that way or can something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is easily addressed by providing prompts and making them an optional starting point. <p> More serious was the problem of access. An annoying, but still fairly easy to solve, problem was that local university computer accounts did not allow for the type of e-mail activity my students were conducting, so students needed to turn to such providers as Hotmail, Yahoo, and AOL. Still, not all students had computers at home, and on-campus computer centers were often not available because of scheduled classes in the labs. However, those hurdles can be overcome by an instructor 's flexibility in assignment scheduling and due dates. Implications <p> From my experience of working with this resource for three semesters and having shared it with a colleague, who was also successful, I am persuaded that the activity can be of great use to instructors -- especially second language instructors -- struggling to engage students in reading texts and responding to them verbally and in writing. Moreover, such engagement has proven authentic, a far cry from writing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grade. <p> In Pedagogy of Freedom( 1998), Freire says : <p> I 've never been an ingenous lover of technology ; I do not deify it nor demonize it. For that reason I 've always felt at ease in dealing with it. I 've no doubt about the enormous potential for technology to motivate and challenge children and adolescents of the less-favored social classes.( 82) <p> He explains further that technology stimulates curiosity. Although " I wonder what today 's story will be about... " may not be exactly the kind of curiosity he had in mind, in my class the materials I provided to my students through technology and the curiosity sparked by the regular e-mail delivery have indeed shown " enormous potential... to motivate and challenge " my students. <p> Educators who are open to the possibility that my experience might point to an interesting direction, who can accept that pop culture might spark useful dialogue and attitudes, who already understand the appeal of e-mail to students, might consider visiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can develop students ' necessary prerequisite interest and confidence in reading and writing. The strategy sets students on the long journey to becoming accomplished and critical readers of print and nonprint texts. <p> <p>
