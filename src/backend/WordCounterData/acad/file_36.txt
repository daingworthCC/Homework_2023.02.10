4004541 The rescue of the Danish Jews from the Nazi roundups of 1943 has become the defining image of Judaism in Denmark, both within the country and to the world outside. This article examines the way in which this story about the past has been constructed, focusing particularly on its portrayals of the types of groups involved and on the motivations of the rescuers. It argues that the dominance and durability of this story in defining Jewish identity in Denmark stems from the type of relationships it posits between Danish Christians, Danish Jews, and worldwide Jewry. Anthropological studies of tradition could be enriched by a greater focus on such collaborative constructions of the past.( Denmark, Jews, history, identity, invention of tradition) <p> The past as a cultural construct has come under anthropological scrutiny over the past fifteen years as part of a general rethinking of the notion of tradition( Ardener 1989 ; Badone 1991, 1992 ; Bauer 1992 ; Buckser 1995 ; Errington and Gewertz 1994, 1996 ; Friedman 1992 ; Guss 1993 ; Herzfeld 1982 ; Handler and Linnekin 1984 ; Hanson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lowenthal 1985 ; Scott 1985 ; Thomas 1992 ; Tonkin et al. 1989 ; Ulin 1995 ; Wilson 1976 ; Woost 1993). Before that time, anthropologists and historians tended to think of tradition as something tangible, as a body of shared customs and beliefs passed on relatively unaltered through time. In the style of nineteenth-century romanticism, they regarded tradition as a sort of patrimony, passed from generation to generation, that contained the core of a culture 's identity and which shaped its understanding of the present. They even classified cultures according to their relationships with tradition. " Traditional, " " cold " cultures were ruled by tradition, whereas " modern, " " hot " cultures rejected and moved beyond it. In the past two decades, however, a radically different picture of tradition began to emerge. Anthropologists, folklorists, and historians began looking at changes in conceptions of tradition, and found that even supposedly cold societies frequently revised or reinvented their understandings of the past( Hobsbawm and Ranger 1984 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invention of tradition " revealed the past as a surprisingly malleable symbolic resource, one which could be and was continually reinterpreted. Rather than the present being shaped by the past, it turned out that the past was largely shaped by the present( Friedman 1992). The focus of study in tradition therefore moved to the mechanisms by which the past was created. What made people invent the traditions that they did? How did particular visions of the past relate to the worlds of those who created them? <p> Most of the literature on this question has focused on issues of power. Scholars have looked at tradition primarily as a means of aggrandizement in asymmetrical political relationships ; in situations of dominance and resistance, groups construct images of the past which support their own political interests. Colonial powers may picture traditional native societies as childlike and archaic, justifying their own appropriation of political authority( Hobsbawm and Ranger 1984 ; Errington and Gewertz 1994). Colonized peoples, by contrast, may imagine the past as a golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overthrow of the invaders and their culture( Scott 1985 ; Friedman 1992). Competing factions in a society may present competing conceptions of tradition, each of which favors the faction which invents it, and each of which may be expressed through public ritual( e.g., Errington and Gewertz 1994 ; Kertzer 1980 ; Dirks 1994). Some scholars have also examined the relationship between tradition and group identity ; they have seen different versions of the past as methods by which different groups express and come to terms with the dilemmas of their own( Friedman 1992 ; Badone 1991 ; Buckser 1995 ; Luhrmann 1989 ; Errington and Gewertz 1996). Taken together, this scholarship has produced a new understanding of the past as a subtle and fluid medium for expressing ideas about the present and plans for the future. <p> In almost all of this work, the past appears as something essentially internal to a group, something produced by a set of people to support its own needs and advance its own interests. When traditions interact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which each group promotes its own image of the past and seeks to discredit alternatives. This focus on competition, while very valuable, has tended to obscure the extent to which the construction of the past may be a collaborative endeavor, one that involves connections between groups as well as divisions. As a symbolic expression of a community, a tradition is analogous in some ways to a presentation of self, a face that a group presents to other groups around it. And as with individual presentations of self, a tradition may be formulated in part to evoke or complement a response from the outside. A shared view of the past may give groups a basis on which to understand and interact with each other ; by establishing a mutually acceptable set of group identities, it may enable them to coexist and co-operate. In this sense, we may be able to see tradition as a subject of negotiation, a symbolic construction which helps to establish relationships between groups. We may be able to get a more comprehensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its role-collaborative as well as oppositional, constructive as well as combative-in shaping those relationships( Badone 1991). <p> This article takes that approach to studying the Danish rescue of the Jews in 1943, an element of the past of great importance to Danish Christians, to Danish Jews, and to the Jewish community outside Denmark. These three groups largely agree on the way the rescue took place, and they tell a fairly standard story about it.1 The article looks at the shape of that story to see what elements it stresses and minimizes, what images of the groups emerge from it, and suggests that this image of the past has become so prominent and durable not only because it portrayed each of these groups in a positive light, but because it provided a framework in which each could understand and interact with the others. THE STANDARD CONSTRUCTION <p> The story of the Danish rescue figures prominently in literature about Denmark and the Holocaust. Much has been written on the rescue itself, including several children 's books( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1987 ; Rittner and Goldberger 1993 ; Friediger 1946 ; Lowry 1989 ; Matas 1987 ; Levin 1966) ; it is also mentioned briefly in many larger works on the Second World War( e.g., Dawidowicz 1975:484-85 ; Tec 1986:7-8 ; Rubenstein and Roth 1987:218). Its events are featured prominently in museums like the Danish Resistance Museum and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, in Washington, D.C. Some of this scholarship has been critical, particularly in studies by Danish scholars, who have pointed out the complexities of the rescue and the often mixed motives of the people involved( Bludnikow 1991 ; Kirchhoff 1995 ; Lund 1975 ; see also Paulsson 1995 ; Yahil 1969). For the general public, however, both in Denmark and abroad, the story is much simpler, providing a stirring counterpoint to the grim history of the Holocaust. We begin, therefore, by recounting the story of the rescue as it is commonly told both in and outside Denmark.2 <p> In April of 1940, the German ground, air, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army was quickly swept aside and the government capitulated almost immediately. The Germans did not, however, treat Denmark as a conquered country. Hitler regarded the Danes as fellow Aryans and he wanted to make Denmark a showpiece for the new Nazi world order. Accordingly, he established Denmark as a " model protectorate, " a state with its own internal government, but under the protection of German military forces and foreign policy. To a large extent, this status was a charade ; Germany routinely infringed on the terms of the protectorate agreement, coercing the government into concessions and looting the Danish treasury. Even so, for the first three years of the occupation, Denmark maintained its own government, police force, and political institutions. <p> This policy received broad support from Danish political leaders, who formed a government of national unity for the duration of the occupation. Most Danes acknowledged the necessity of this policy, and they supported the government steadily until 1943. Even so, the occupation aroused widespread anger, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few did so through resistance activity, operating underground presses and forming secret military units. More often, however, the resistance was symbolic. Danes ignored the Germans in social interactions, used British colors in their clothing and house decoration, and subjected the Germans to a peculiarly Danish form of subtle ridicule. This resistance found its most tangible symbol in the person of King Christian X, whose daily horseback rides through the streets of Copenhagen came to symbolize defiance of German authority. Surrounded by throngs on foot and bicycle, oblivious to the presence of German soldiers, the king presented an image of a nation conquered territorially, but spiritually unbowed. <p> Christian also embodied Danish views of the 7,000 Jews who lived in the capital. Stories circulated that Christian had prevented the Germans from introducing the yellow star in Denmark ; when told that Jews might be required to wear the star, he proclaimed that he and his family would wear it as well( e.g., Bertelsen 1954:14). Other stories reported Christian wearing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now aware that these stories are apocryphal, but they remain widely believed outside Denmark.3 Moreover, they mesh with the actual treatment of Jews by the king and the government during the occupation. The government steadfastly refused to take any measures that might have singled Jews out for discriminatory treatment, resisting repeated German insistence that something must be done about the " Jewish problem. " The Jewish school and synagogue remained open, and Nazi efforts to incite anti-Jewish hooliganism were stymied by the Danish courts. Christian himself used the protocol of his office to express his solidarity with the Jewish community. While the Nazi presence aroused concern among the Jews, therefore, the community remained essentially unmolested for the first three years of the occupation. <p> In August of 1943, however, the situation changed dramatically. The increasing level of sabotage by the Danish resistance, as well as escalating German violations of the Danish constitution, led to the resignation of the government and the collapse of the protectorate agreement. Germany placed Denmark under martial law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforce it. Best quickly began rounding up " suspicious " members of the Danish intelligentsia, including leaders of the Jewish community. He also began laying plans for the capture and deportation of Danish Jewry as a whole. He obtained membership lists for the synagogue, brought in special Gestapo troops for the roundup, and arranged for ship and rail transport from Copenhagen to the Theresienstadt concentration camp. He planned the roundups for October 1, the first night of the Jewish New Year celebration, when Jewish families would be gathered in their homes for holiday dinners. Best knew that the roundup would produce outrage, and possibly inspire some violence, but the nighttime roundups were expected to minimize the reaction ; by the time the Danes were aware of it, the operation would be a fait accompli. <p> In actuality, of course, it failed spectacularly, due in large part to two unexpected developments. One was the loss of surprise. A German shipping attache named Georg Duckwitz leaked word of the plan to Danish political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish community. After initial disbelief, community leaders spread the word to their members and urged them to go into hiding. The other element was the non-Jewish community of Copenhagen. As word of the roundup spread, an enormous and largely spontaneous effort sprang up to help the Jews escape. Private citizens from all walks of life offered shelter and financial assistance to Jews, in many cases to total strangers. A suddenly energized resistance organized safe houses and courier routes to bring Jews to the northern coast, where fishing boats were covertly chartered to provide passage to Sweden. Over the next two weeks, an elaborate collaboration of resistance workers, hospitals, schools, churches, and thousands of concerned non-Jews ferried all but about 400 of the fugitives to safety.4 The effort extended to Jewish property and sacred spaces as well. When the Jews returned from Sweden in 1945, they found their homes, their businesses, and their places of worship largely intact. In all, less than 200 of the 7,000 Jews in Denmark perished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dramatic defeat for the Final Solution ; one that produced rage in Berlin and galvanized the resistance in Denmark. <p> The rescue had little organization in its first days, and its success depended on the spontaneous action of large numbers of non-Jews. Descriptions of the rescue tend to dwell heavily on these actions, using anecdotes to convey the individual level at which the rescue operated. The anecdotes make stirring reading. Some depict Jews being approached in the street or on trains by benevolent strangers, who provide shelter or money without hope of repayment. Others relate the machinations at the Royal Hospital, where doctors and nurses hid Jews in rooms under Christian names. One of the most moving accounts concerns the rescue of the Torah scrolls at the synagogue in central Copenhagen. The priests of a nearby church became concerned that the Nazis would burn the scrolls, which they knew were highly sacred to Jews. On one of the first nights of the roundup, therefore, several of them broke into the synagogue, stole the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church for the duration of the war( cf. Pundik 1993). Again and again, such anecdotes emphasize the spontaneity of the rescue, the widespread support for it, and the resourcefulness with which the rescuers outwitted the Gestapo.5 <p> This narrative carries in it a host of potent symbols from the Holocaust : images of good and evil, of intolerance and acceptance, weakness versus strength. The notion of a nation of Christians, as Aryan as the Germans claimed to be, fighting successfully against overwhelming forces to protect their Jewish countrymen makes a powerful allegory for the moral imperatives of wartime Europe. The power of this story has enshrined Denmark in Jewish memory as a paragon of virtue, and generated such monuments as Denmark Square in Jerusalem and the Thanks to Scandinavia Foundation in New York. It has also served as a model for Danish international and human-rights policies in the postwar era ; as an outspoken advocate of democracy and minority rights, Denmark has sought to live up to the image of what many consider its finest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of the Danish rescue is, of course, an oversimplification. The motives of the actors, the nature of the communities, and the unfolding of events were far more complex than this narrative suggests. Like any construction of the past, the established version of the Danish rescue chooses selectively from a body of data, producing an image that reflects the interests of its creators as much as the actual events of the time. This is not to say that the story of the rescue is somehow untrue or fraudulent, but merely that it is a story written by human beings, and as such is only a partial version. For our purposes here, it raises three questions. First, how was this popular version constructed? What elements of the data were stressed and which minimized to produce the narrative that emerged? Second, what forces shaped this selection? How did this selection relate to the interests of the groups that were involved in this construction of the past? Third, why did this image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Denmark itself? To get a sense of these questions, let us focus on two features of this story and ask how each relates to the interests and interactions of the groups involved. The Uniformity of the Groups <p> One striking feature of the rescue narrative is the uniformity it attributes to the different groups of actors. The Danes, the Jews, and the Germans each act as units ; for each group, a single set of motives and interests can be used to describe its actions. The Danes, for example, are tolerant, humane, and patriotic, defiant of the German occupation and united in support of the Jews. When their actions are described, a stress is laid on uniform and anonymous behavior.6 We see them thronging around the symbolic personage of Christian X, or shunning the Nazi Party, or interceding spontaneously on behalf of stranded Jews. The Jews, for their part, are relatively passive human cargo, and little mention is made of any distinctions among them. Literature often refers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrated into Danish society ; beyond this, their social structure is generally unmentioned( e.g., Bertelsen 1954:7-8 ; Rubenstein and Roth 1987:218 ; Tec 1986:7-8 ; Tunley 1963:74). The Germans, in turn, are Nazis, devoted to the German cause and eager to ferret out the Jews. The machinery that attempted the roundups in October was essentially the same as that which captured the Jews of France, Poland, and the other occupied countries. For all of the actors, the standard construction of the rescue minimizes internal distinctions and stresses common values and interests. <p> This construction, like any construction of the past, does some violence to the truth. None of these three groups was by any means uniform ; the divisions within them ran deep, and in some cases had powerful effects on the course of the rescue. While the great majority of the Danes opposed the German occupation, for example, they were far from uniform in their view of how best to handle it. In the early years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, regarded active resistance with ambivalence or outright hostility( Kieler 1987:142-43 ; Yahil 1969:251 ; Pundik 1987:79). Many assumed that the Germans would win, and they had no desire to provoke German anger. Indeed, the German demands for food and war materials provided a valued financial boon to many farmers and manufacturers. Attitudes toward the Jews, likewise, ranged from sympathetic to hostile, as they did in some other parts of Western Europe. And while the Danish Nazis never achieved a large following, they played a disproportionately large role in the events of the rescue( cf. Yahil 1969:84-109 ; Bertelsen 1954:15 ; Rohde 1982:80).7 Similar divisions characterized the Jewish and German communities as well. To describe these groups as monolithic blocs of actors ignores some deep and important differences within their ranks. <p> To a certain extent, this simplification reflects the requirements of storytelling ; a story works more easily and effectively with simplified caricatures than with the complex identities of actual life. Yet it also makes statements about the actors involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews. Issues of unity and division were highly contested within each of these communities, and their presentation as unified blocs implied a particular resolution of those contests. For the Danes, for example, the image of uniformity emerged in the context of an intense national debate on the role of Denmark during the occupation. As the war neared its end, it was not self-evident how Denmark would be treated by the victors ; its resistance had offered significant opposition to the Germans, but its farmers had supplied them with important provisions( Yahil 1969:117-18). Denmark had agreed to protectorate status for the first three years of the war, and had signed the anti-Comintern pact. And while the resistance movement had finally emerged as the nation 's effective government in 1944, the public had strongly supported the co-operative coalition government until it resigned in 1943. Was the nation that Churchill had once derided as " Hitler 's canary "( Flender 1963:20) to be treated as a victim of Hitler or as his ally? Danish concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self-examination after the liberation. On the street and in the press, Danes agonized over the nature and the extent of Danish collaboration with the Germans. Over 15,000 suspected collaborators were arrested and jailed, and the long-extinct death penalty was revived to deal with them. A flurry of articles, memoirs, and books on the occupation flooded the country, producing a documentary record of the war unmatched elsewhere in Europe( Yahil 1969:370-72). The divisions and inconsistencies of the Danish response to Nazism became wrenching problems for both national identity and international status. <p> In this context, this construction of the rescue provides a reassuring image. It portrays the resistance as the expression of a unified Danish national will. In its defiance of the Germans and its commitment to human rights, the resistance acts out what other Danes feel internally. The events of the rescue show this relationship concretely ; while the resistance workers take the most active role in the rescue, all Danes lend a hand where they can. The myriad individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, attest to the overwhelming unity of Danish views of Nazism. Danish collaborators with the Nazis appear as rare exceptions who merit the scorn and punishment of the larger society. The rescue story thus glosses over the ambiguities of the Danish relationship with Germany, placing Denmark among the steadfast opponents of fascism and minimizing the divisions within its ranks. <p> Group uniformity also made a statement for the Danish Jews, one related not so much to relations with the outside as to their own internal structure. For the Jews, uniformity existed even less than for the larger Danish population. The Jewish community before 1935 had been divided into two very distinct groups : the " Viking Jews, " descendants of Sephardic and German immigrations in the eighteenth century, and the " Russians, " members of a wave of Jewish immigration between 1905 and 1917( Bludnikow 1986 ; Welner 1965 ; Bamberger 1983 ; Melchior 1987 ; Melchior 1965 ; Yahil 1969:10-26 ; Blum 1972:37-39). Differences and animosities between the two factions ran deep, and relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews were Danish speakers, heavily assimilated, politically conservative, and relatively wealthy. The Russians spoke Yiddish or heavily accented Danish, wore East European clothing, supported Bundist or Zionist causes, and earned meager livings as petty tradesmen( Bamberger 1983:123). The Russians had larger families and greater religious participation than the Vikings, and by 1940 they constituted a clear majority of the community. The Vikings, however, maintained control of community institutions ; they dominated the powerful community council, they held all of its major positions, and they largely excluded Russians from the B'nai B'rith.8 The situation became further complicated in the years before the occupation, when Denmark became a haven for about 1,500 Jewish refugees( Blum 1972:41 ; Yahil 1969:18-21). These Jews spanned a variety of languages, cultures, and national backgrounds. What united them were their common poverty, their common experience of flight, and the fact that the Danish government regarded almost all of them as illegal aliens.9 <p> In this context, the issue of group unity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vikings in numbers and political power. The Vikings ' position was maintained primarily by the divided authority structure manifest in the communal board and the B'nai B'rith-in effect, by the system of ethnic and factional divisions in the Jewish community. Moreover, these divisions supported the Vikings ' own views of themselves, as Danes first of all and Jews second. Keeping a distance from the Russians and the refugees allowed them to maintain their accustomed, heavily assimilated identity. For the Russians, on the other hand, the equality of all Jews was a key goal. The divisions in the community obstructed their efforts to exercise influence proportional to their numbers. They also kept the Russians out of favored social and economic circles. In addition, obliterating distinctions among Jews accorded with their understandings of Jewishness. The Russians had relatively weak national and linguistic ties to Denmark ; their primary identity lay with the Jews of Yiddish-speaking Eastern Europe, where many of them still had extensive family ties. Their political affiliations ran to Zionism and Bundism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de-emphasized ties to particular nationalities. Conceiving Danish Jewry as a unit, rather than as a graded hierarchy, suited both the political interests and the self-perceptions of the Yiddish-speaking immigrants. <p> The events of 1943 resolved this conflict in favor of the Russians. The rescue ended the dominance of the Viking Jews in Denmark. Their policies of co-operation and keeping a low profile had not succeeded in preventing the Nazi roundups, and the passage to Sweden had put all Jews quite literally in the same boat. After the war, the Russians assumed full equality in the community, and the Viking Jews receded from prominence. Many of the Vikings converted to Christianity, and others assimilated in other ways( Yahil 1969:378). Within a few years, the Russians dominated all areas of congregation life, as they continue to do today. This reality is conveyed in the image of the rescue that the community promotes. It portrays the Jews as an undifferentiated mass of humanity, whose differences had no effect either on their treatment by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swedes. It shows them in the way that the Russians thought they ought to be, and in the way that the Russians made them after the war. The emphasis on uniformity thus expresses ideas not only about the position of Denmark in the war, but about the nature of the Jewish community as well. <p> It also suits the needs of a third group with an abiding interest in the Danish Jews : the Jewish community beyond Denmark. Much of the scholarly work on the Danish rescue has been carried out by Jews in Israel or North America, and the Jewish literature on the Holocaust refers frequently to the situation in Denmark. A key question in this literature concerns the inaction of bystanders in the face of Nazi persecutions. How was it that so many Germans, French, Poles, and others stood by while their neighbors were systematically disenfranchised and murdered? What does it say about human morality when inhumanity on such a scale can meet with such indifference? In this context, the standard construction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nation united in support of the Jews and opposed to Nazi inhumanity. It shows a people among whom not only a few resistance fighters, but also the mass of private citizens saw direct action against persecution as a moral necessity.10 And it shows these in a nation which might arguably have been expected to follow the German model-a nation of Lutheran Aryans under the military control of the Gestapo. For those trying to fit the Holocaust into an explanatory paradigm, whether historical or religious, the Danish rescue provides evidence that choice was possible, that non-Jews did not have to behave in the way that they too often did.11 <p> As part of such an allegory, the story of the rescue works best if the characters are uniform. By reducing the Danes, the Jews, and the Germans to uniform blocs, the story makes it possible to characterize their behavior in clear moral terms. The relations between them are those of individual actors, with consciences and moral imperatives ; the Germans are evil, the Jews helpless, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are national sentiments, moreover, they provide a unique allegorical resource. Examples of heroic individuals can be culled from rescue stories all over Europe ; the heroic behavior of a nation, however, is restricted to Denmark( e.g., Asch 1954:vii). In this sense, the uniformity implicit in the standard story of the Danish rescue turns the event into a symbolic resource of great value for Jews trying to make moral and historical sense of their people 's greatest catastrophe. Attribution of Motives <p> A second notable feature of the rescue story is its portrayal of the motives of the rescuers. Why did so many Danes risk so much to aid the Jews, when many others in Europe turned a blind eye to Nazi persecutions? What made them willing to treat the Jews with the humanity so often absent elsewhere? The standard story of the rescue offers a simple and appealing answer : the Danes were motivated by an ethical system, one which could not tolerate anti-Semitism( e.g., Goldberger 1987:206-07 ; Asch 1954:vii ; Yahil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture was imbued with a sense of tolerance and equality, which treated religious affiliation as a matter of personal choice. Denmark had given Jews religious freedom early in the nineteenth century, and the country had seen almost none of the anti-Jewish violence that was widespread in nineteenth-century Germany. The Danes therefore regarded the Jews first of all as Danish citizens, equal in all respects to Christians. To round them up was as great an outrage as to round up any other Dane, and the popular reaction was inevitable. Persecutions of the Jews could never have been successful in Denmark, because the type of prejudice it required was incompatible with Danish notions of human rights. <p> This portrayal has a good deal of truth in it. Denmark did treat its Jews far better than most European countries, and many of those who took part in the rescue acted primarily out of ethical concerns. At the same time, however, this picture of Danish motivation overlooks important aspects of the Jews ' situation there. Anti-Semitism was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widespread prejudices and stereotypes leveled at Jews( Welner 1965 ; Rohde 1982). Some Danes sympathized with Nazi anti-Jewish propaganda, and Jewish leaders thought it important to maintain as low a profile as possible( Melchior 1965:149 ; Haestrup 1987:23-24). The Jews were not, moreover, all highly assimilated. Many of the Russians were easily identifiable by their black clothing and Yiddish accents ; the refugees, poor and foreign, were even more so. They were not, in fact, Danes like any other Danes, and many were not Danes at all.12 Nor were the rescuers all equally ethical. While most ran great risks with no benefit to themselves, others, notably some of the fishermen who provided the passage, profited handsomely from the enterprise( Yahil 1969:251). And while the vast majority of the nation opposed the persecution of the Jews, the persecution of the Communists a year earlier had met with little opposition. The actual motivation for the rescue remains an intriguing puzzle, whose ultimate solution will inevitably be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purity propagated in the rescue story. <p> The story as it is told, however, offers important benefits for the parties concerned. For the Danes, it proposes a clearly flattering self-image ; it makes them paragons of ethical responsibility, leaders in an international struggle against racism and intolerance. Denmark has become an archetype of liberal values since the war, based in no small part on its actions during the rescue. Beyond this image, the rescue 's construction of motivation offers a resolution to a long-standing problem in Danish society. Danish culture lays a heavy emphasis on homogeneity ; for a long time, the Danes have seen and governed themselves as a small country with an ethnically uniform population. The granting of equality to Jews in 1814 stemmed in large part from the government 's interest in having a uniform law to apply to all subjects( Gold 1975:192-217). In the nineteenth century, this conception was expressed in a cultural and religious movement called Grundtvigianism, which argued that a unique Danish spirit was at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lausten 1987:216-44). Grundtvigianism experienced a powerful revival during the occupation, and was a motivating force for many leaders of the Danish resistance( Pelican 1987 ; Kieler 1987:142 ; Yahil 1991). Under such circumstances, religious and ethnic minorities posed a conceptual problem. How did one account for the flourishing of nonconformist groups in a culture centered around a common tradition and spirit? The very existence of groups like the Jews challenged the notion of a distinctive Danish identity, and was the subject of debate among theologians and politicians( Manniche 1984:219-50). The rescue story provides a way out of this conceptual dilemma. It portrays tolerance as one of the core values of Danish society ; what makes the Danes special is above all their respect for human rights without regard to race or creed. They are distinguished from all other nations in Europe by their sense of tolerance and by their willingness to act on ethical principles. In such a scenario, the presence of the Jews is not a challenge to Danish identity, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the fact that they are included in the very heart of Danish society, attests to the tolerance that defines Danish culture. By attributing the rescue to Danish ethics, the rescue story resolves a nagging conflict between majority and minority culture in Denmark. <p> Such a resolution had important benefits for the Jews as well. Judaism had long been a covert matter in Denmark ; while Jews were not actively persecuted, they were the subject of significant suspicion and prejudice, and accordingly they kept a low profile. Community leaders worked hard to establish themselves as " Danes of Jewish faith, " rather than as Jews( Blum 1972:38). The Viking Jews had assimilated so completely in part because of the powerful pressures toward conformity exerted by Danish society.13 The Russian Jews had neither the means nor the desire to assimilate so totally, and they suffered from some discrimination as a result. After the rescue, however, attitudes toward Jews changed. As emblems of Danish tolerance, the Jews became valued in a way they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was possible for Jews to openly embrace Jewish faith and cultural traditions( Goldstein 1993:43-44). Jewish holidays were celebrated publicly, Jewish literature blossomed, outspoken Jews became prominent in politics and the media. Denmark became a steadfast supporter of Israel, and many Danish Christian youths spent time working on kibbutzim. One Jew growing up after the war described the rescue as a sort of sunshine, which made it possible to be publicly happy about being Jewish( Goldstein 1993). The image of the Danes conveyed by the rescue allowed Jews for the first time to become fully a part of Denmark. <p> This image of Danish motivation also had significance for the larger Jewish community. Human rights became an important concern for many Jews after the Second World War. The events of the Holocaust had dramatically underscored the dangers of prejudice and discrimination, both against Jews and against others. The best guarantor of Jewish survival, many felt, was the elimination of all racial, ethnic, and religious intolerance. The Danes became an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a triumph over racism and prejudice was possible( e.g., Asch 1954). The events of the rescue symbolized the dramatic effects that such a triumph could have ; the difference between tolerance and intolerance was quite literally a difference between life and death. By portraying the Danes as motivated by tolerance and ethics, the story of the rescue made them a powerful and useful symbol for Jews around the world. THE PAST AS COLLABORATION <p> Fifty-four years have now passed since the rescue ; years that have seen important changes for both Denmark and for its Jewish minority. Denmark has become more urban, more internationally oriented, and slightly more diverse in its population. Its cultural and political life are bound more tightly with the Europe to its south, and Germany has become one of its most important allies. The Danish Jews have experienced a complex combination of assimilation, immigration, and religious renewal( Blum 1972 ; Elazar et al. 1984). They have also experienced occasional friction with the larger society, particularly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might expect that the events of 1943 would be fading into history, just as importance of the occupation has gradually faded from Danish-German relations. Yet they have not. The memory of the rescue is invoked regularly with anniversary celebrations and commemorative volumes, and it figures strongly in Danish history books and museums. A growing body of scholarship has dissected the history of the rescue, and a rising mountain of memoirs keeps adding to the data on it. In America and Israel, groups like Thanks to Scandinavia work hard to keep the memory of 1943 alive.14 Their efforts have largely succeeded, to the point of exclusion of more recent history. Books about the history of the Danish Jews, even those published since 1980, tend to all but end with the rescue, mentioning the period after 1945 briefly if at all( e.g., Bamberger 1983 ; Melchior 1987). When I have mentioned Jews to non-Jewish Danes, whether in Copenhagen or in Western Jutland, the subject of the rescue is usually the first issue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community. Outside of Denmark, the rescue constitutes the only thing that many Jews know about either Christian or Jewish Danes. The dominance and staying power of this particular image of the past has been remarkable. Where does it come from? <p> In part, the answer lies in the identities which this story implies for its participants. For Danes, it offers a self-image that verges on sainthood. It shows them fighting for human rights, risking their lives for their countrymen, acting in unity and common purpose. It places them on the victorious side of the Second World War, and gives them a moral victory over the German army that crushed them so easily. For the Jews, this story implies a valued unity and security. It highlights their identity as Jews, and their links with the rest of European Jewry ; at the same time, it makes them valued members of Danish society, people for whom total strangers would risk their lives. The story of the rescue paints both Danes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they would want to remember it. <p> But Denmark and the Jews have experienced a lot since then, much of which would also make flattering narrative. The Jews can and do take pride in their political activity, both in Denmark and abroad, as well as their leadership in some areas of Danish intellectual and cultural life. Denmark has become an international leader in many areas of design, engineering, and progressive social policy. Why have these activities not joined the rescue as an emblems of the Jewish community in Denmark? What makes those few weeks in October such a potent and enduring symbol of the place of Jews in Denmark? <p> I would argue that their endurance stems from their ability to structure relationships between the different groups involved. For non-Jewish Danes, the rescue story made the Jews thinkable ; it resolved the contradiction between homogeneity and ethnic diversity in Denmark, by making the Jews an emblem of Danish tolerance. For Jews, it made possible a rapprochement with Danish society, one which enabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visibly in the larger culture. This construction of the past contained not only a message about the nature of the two groups, but a template for their interaction in the postwar world. It also gave them a place in the discourse of Jews elsewhere in the world. It turned the Christians and the Jews in Denmark into evocative symbolic figures in discussions about good, evil, intolerance, and compassion during the Holocaust. <p> This may be why the image has proved so enduring. The identities and relationships implicit in the rescue story continue to be an appealing way for Danes and Jews to understand one another, particularly in light of recent complications in their relationship. In recent years, both parties have had their reputations sullied somewhat. The invasion of Lebanon and the intifadeh dimmed the enthusiasm of many Danes for Israel, particularly on the political left, and the Jewish community 's strong stand on Israel 's behalf drew considerable criticism. Denmark 's image of tolerance, meanwhile, has come under attack in the wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turkish immigrants( Enoch 1994). The Danes who discriminate against Muslims and protest the Copenhagen mosque make less comfortable neighbors for the Jews than the ones who risked all to fight intolerance ; the Jews who participate vigorously in controversies about Israel and the refugee crisis disquiet the Danes more than the inoffensive assimilated ones whom the Nazis sought to destroy. And neither contemporary group fits as well into Jewish ethical and philosophical discourse as the static images of 1943. Accordingly, none of the parties has a particular interest in revising the rescue story, or in replacing it with some other model for relations between the groups. For all its inaccuracies, the rescue story still works, and this may be the root of its staying power. <p> All of this carries a lesson for anthropological approaches to the past. As noted earlier, most anthropological studies of tradition have looked at it in terms of individual groups ; the past is a means for establishing a group identity and promoting group interests. Where intergroup relations have been considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, where each party tries to advance its version of the past and discredit others. This approach understates the extent to which the connections and interdependencies between groups affect their constructions of the past. Social entities, even when in competition, generally rely on one another for exchange, for alliances, and for self-definition. Their interaction requires some common understanding of their respective natures. Where groups are in a great deal of contact, such as in pluralistic societies, a common framework for understanding group identities becomes vitally important. The past offers a powerful medium for the establishment of such a framework. The past roots identities, and hence relationships, in an apparently objective set of facts, one seemingly immune to the uncertainty and unpredictability of contemporary alliances. By agreeing upon a shared history, groups can agree on the identities implicit in that history, and hence set the terms for their ongoing interaction. The lavish rituals that so often commemorate historical events, be they celebrations of the Danish rescue, of the October Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to assert group self-perceptions, but also to reaffirm and consecrate intergroup connections. <p> This role suggests some limits to the flexibility of the past as an instrument of group expression. Much of the literature on the invention of tradition portrays the past as an almost infinitely malleable resource, one whose form is constrained only by the personal memories and imaginations of the members of a culture. If the past is simply a means for expressing group interests and identities, then it can take almost any form. No view of history has any necessary connection with an objective understanding of " what actually happened. " The collaborative dimensions of the past, however, imply that it may be more grounded than that. Although groups construct the past in ways that reflect their self-conceptions, they are not free to construct it in any way they wish ; unless they are completely isolated, they must construe their past in a way that can articulate to some degree with the conceptions of their neighbors. The more they interact with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the less responsive history can be to the expressive needs of one group. Not that this process will somehow produce a truly objective history ; history inevitably involves editing and distortion of the events it describes( Ardener 1989). But narratives negotiated between groups are subject to requirements and pressures different from those created separately. They may be more resistant to change, for example, and they may have more difficulty ignoring anomalous actors and events. To the extent that anthropologists explore this collaborative dimension of the past, we enrich our understanding of the way histories are created and of the reasons why they endure. <p>
