4170241 # I have been interested for several years in how and under what circumstances two or more events are understood to happen at the same time, as well as in the textual, visual, and epistemological practices that support this understanding. Although different disciplines, from literature to cognitive science and from history to anthropology, have taken up the problem under different names, at different scales, and with different commitments, my focus for the purposes of this essay is on how what I am calling the " simultaneity effect " can work in particular kinds of literary texts.1 # Elsewhere I have focused on how the idea of simultaneity gets produced at the level of the sentence, in what I call " historicist sentences " that depend for their authority and credibility on a string of parallel clauses often anchored by a date.2 These sentences depend on an implied or explicit " while " or " meanwhile " that exerts a gravitational-and often also grammatical-pull on our necessarily linear syntax. At the same time, they try to reference and enact synchrony through what is arguably a diachronic form. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands of simultaneity : tense, parallelism, and legibility can suffer as a result of the temporal work the sentence is asked to do. My intervention in this essay comes at the slightly larger scale of plot. If on the level of the sentence simultaneity challenges syntax, then on the level of plot both reader and writer face the epistemological and perhaps ethical challenge of keeping other plots and other characters in mind as the novel progresses to its( usually) euphoric end. # Benedict Anderson famously sees the act of novel reading itself as an exercise in simultaneity. In his account, readers form communities through imagining others reading the same texts at the same time that they do.3 Simultaneity also works for Anderson within the novel itself : what he calls " old-fashioned " novels depend on " the presentation of simultaneity in ' homogeneous, empty time ' " and serve as " a complex gloss upon the word ' meanwhile. ' " 4 He offers the example of characters A, B, C, and D, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife( B) and a mistress( C), who in turn has a lover( D). " 5 " Notice, " says Anderson, " that during this sequence A and D never meet, indeed may not be aware of each other 's existence if C has played her cards right. " 6 What links A and D, despite C 's machinations, is in part that that they are " embedded in the minds of omniscient readers " who make connections through a learned practice of literacy.7 It is readers, then, who grant and enact omniscience by keeping the " meanwhile " -and the characters whose lives are signaled by it-in mind. # What happens, then, when the " meanwhile " of the sentence and that of the reading situation are not( quite) powerful enough to keep all the relevant characters in readers ' imaginations at the same time? In the last column of a chart illustrating some of the possible permutations of simultaneous action for the four characters, Anderson imagines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B, " " C has an ominous dream, " and " D gets drunk in a bar. " 8 Even in this balanced example that includes all the actors in the novel, it would be easy to imagine becoming engrossed in the dialogue between A and B and sucked into the stream of consciousness of C. Unless poor D got into a bar fight, it would be easy for the reader to imagine-or to fail to imagine-D as fixed in place while A, B, and C claim the attention of their readers through the more arresting narrative conventions of the dialogue and the dream. As with much narrative theory, Anderson 's algebra of simultaneity offers no explicit sign of power or status difference among narrative positions. What would happen if we invested Anderson 's variables with classed or raced histories so that one of these alphabetically marked creatures occupied a world less familiar to the expert readers of marriage- or post-marriage-plot novels? While postcolonial criticism and fiction writing have produced subaltern readings dedicated to imagining the lives of minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or places invoked but not represented in the novel, such as Antiguan plantations in Mansfield Park, there has been little if any discussion of how these( non) representations accede to and resist the novel 's premise/promise of simultaneity : the simultaneity effect.9 # The novel Anderson is imagining is, it seems, resolutely a post-marriage-plot novel : perhaps European rather than English, perhaps, a Victorian reader might assume, French. Within the English tradition we might expect, instead, a powerful and structuring marriage plot. If Alex Woloch sees in many Victorian novels a competition among characters for agency and representation, one might also see the English multiplot novel as an ultimately unequal competition among plots.10 While the multiplot novel, as its name perhaps deceptively suggests, is committed to the representation of lives and events that unfold under widely different conditions, the genre is nonetheless in thrall to a certain privileged set of plots-most notably the marriage plot and the linked plots of education and class advancement.11 While, as I discuss below, Victorian short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the traces of novel plots can be powerfully mapped onto these shorter pieces. This essay explores what happens when the simultaneity effect fails on the level of plot, when a text has an opportunity to explore parallel temporalities but makes that exploration difficult-perhaps too difficult for most readers, even those who, as Anderson suggests, are trained to imagine the lives of characters unfolding across " empty time. " Each of my textual examples, Elizabeth Gaskell 's social-problem novel Mary Barton( 1848) and Anthony Trollope 's short story " The Journey to Panama "( 1861), is remarkable both for its investment in the simultaneity effect and for its sophistication in depicting the epistemological difficulties underlying the representation of simultaneity.12 While I will be arguing that both texts try conscientiously to imagine and represent their plots as occupying a single novelistic temporality through the simultaneity effect, I maintain that they also articulate a more radical insight about how differences in status and power produce different temporali- ties. Although subject to the diachronic movement of plot and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporalities and thus with something that might be called " relative time. " Ultimately, however, both Gaskell 's novel and Trollope 's short story refuse in different ways to make good on their ideas of relative time(s), absorbing temporal differences into dominant plots and hegemonic cultural forms. # Before looking in detail at how the texts I have chosen negotiate the problem of simultaneity, it might be useful to say a few words about the stakes of that problem. By my invocation of the postcolonial, and of the uneven access of characters and plots to representation, I have suggested that there might be an ethical dimension to simultaneity and to the simultaneity effect. Much of the understanding of the connection between ethics and temporality comes to us via anthropology, specifically through the conversations initiated by Johannes Fabian 's idea of " coevality. ' ' 13 In his influential 1983 study, Time and the Other, Fabian addresses anthropological method and epistemology, arguing that traditional anthropology denies coevality to its indigenous subjects of study, as it assumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporalities and different relations to time. The Other of traditional anthropology is, according to Fabian, imagined as being belated, out of time, and as the denial of a shared temporality produced by and complicit with Western colonialism. Fabian 's corrective to this denial, or to what he calls " allochronism, " is the granting of presentness to the anthropological Other. " Homochronism " is, for Fabian, the understanding that encounters between anthropologists and their subjects unfold within a shared temporality that for him is always in the present tense. While anthropology has to some extent moved away from the use of the term " coeval, " there have been, to my knowledge, no sustained critiques of the concept from the standpoint of the temporal.14 While granting coevality to the Other importantly allows that Other a present tense, it may underemphasize different histories, different experiences of time, different temporalities-in other words, it might sacrifice the insights of relative time. While allochronism as Fabian describes it freezes other cultures in time, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standardizes time. The ethical conundrums of fieldwork are not identical to the ethical negotiations of the novel ; it is more comfortable for me to talk of " granting " coevality to a fictional character than to a human being. I hope to show later in this paper, however, that granting is neither easy nor unproblematic. Mary Barton and " Journey to Panama " both go out of their way to construct temporal Others, to explore their differences through the production of relative time(s), and, finally, to collect the different temporalities of their texts into a dominant temporality. For me, the most interesting and productive moment with respect to both narration and ethics is the moment at which the texts imagine not a homochronism nor a coevality but an often disturbing notion of relative time(s). That these moments ultimately get shut down or reabsorbed is both beside the point and the point of this essay. Generic imperatives-certainly of the novel but even of the short story-make it all too easy to standardize time. # I. HARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barton, Mary 's aunt Esther, the novel 's prostitute figure, is arrested while trying to warn her brother that Mary might be following in her footsteps by encouraging a rich and unscrupulous suitor. We hear nothing further of Esther until she is released into the action of the novel four chapters later. While we do not know, in these chapters, about anything that happens to Esther in prison, we do know at the moment of her arrest that she is very anxious about what might happen to Mary in her absence. The last representation of Esther 's interiority before she enters prison stresses not her fear of the treadmill or of solitary confinement-both emerging penal technologies in the New Bailey of the 1840s-but her anxiety about what might happen outside the prison walls : " So the night wore away. The next morning she was taken up to the New Bailey. It was a clear case of disorderly vagrancy, and she was committed to prison for a month. How much might happen in that time! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard time at the New Bailey, we can detect in this valedictory moment a sense of competing temporalities marked by the slowness of the night, the relentless efficiency of the legal judgment of Esther 's case, and the sense, apparently shared by the narrator in the last exclamatory sentence of free indirect discourse, that " much might happen " in the outside world during the time of her imprisonment. # Esther is, as it turns out, right that " much might happen " to her friends and in the plots within which the other characters ' lives unfold. Esther 's imprisonment marks-although it does not accede in-the speeding up of the linked marriage and classadvancement plots, whose incident-packed progress leaves Esther far behind. During Esther 's thirty days in prison, enough happens in the marriage plot alone to undermine the temporal realism of the text. At first, time passes all too quickly. Soon after Esther, unbeknownst to Mary, enters the New Bailey, the latter receives a proposal from the novel 's working-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently takes Mary only a few seconds to realize she has made a mistake : after Jem leaves abruptly, because he " could not bear to wait " for a final response, she calls after him, but the narrator tells us " it was too late "( p. 151). Mary 's change of heart is sudden and complete : " It was scarcely ten minutes since he had entered the house, and found Mary in comparative peace, and now she lay half across the dresser, her head hidden in her hands, and every part of her body shaking with the violence of her sobs. She could not have told at first... why she was in such agonized grief. It was too sudden for her to analyse, or think upon it. She only felt, that by her own doing her life would be hereafter dreary and blank "( pp. 151-2). # The " ten minutes " of clock time that separate Mary " at... peace " from Mary in " agonized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marriage plot, as Mary is hailed into the subject and bodily positions that this plot makes available for heroines of the genre to which this novel famously succumbs.15 As the heroine of a marriage-plot novel, Mary must experience the violence and humiliation of a first failed proposal by the man who turns out to have always been the good suitor and ready herself to give a different answer when he asks a second time. Jem 's refusal to wait initiates the more familiar waiting time of the marriage plot, in which women remain confined-in middle-class homes, in moated granges, or in this case in a Manchester tenement-until their suitors return. The transformative ten minutes produce in Mary the almost instant conviction that seamlessly the " rest of her life " will be " dreary and blank. " As readers of marriage plots and marriage-plot novels, we may settle in with Mary for a very long wait and, indeed, at two separate points in this period, Mary resists and then accepts her female friends ' gendered counsel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. # Waiting time for Mary is marked and measured by a calculus emanating from the dramatis personae of the marriage plot in the person of the would-be seducer, Harry Carson. It is Harry 's activities-his stalking of Mary through the streets of Manchester-that generate the pace and temporality of this period in Mary 's life. While the novel does not tell us exactly how long Harry follows Mary during this initial period of waiting, it feels to Mary and probably to most readers relentless and prolonged : # But far worse than this, was the being so constantly waylaid as she went home by her persevering lover ; who had been so long acquainted with all her habits, that she found it difficult to evade him. Late or early, she was never certain of being free from him. Go this way or that, he might come up some cross street when she had just congratulated herself on evading him for that day... And all this time Jem Wilson never came! Not to see her-that she did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what, but she had hoped he would have come on some excuse, just to see if she had n't changed her mind. He never came. Then she grew weary and impatient, and her spirits sank. #( p. 163) # Harry 's behavior is repetitive : he accosts Mary " constantly " and she is " never certain " that he will not be waiting for her. The temporal markers in the first part of this passage, along with the use of the continuous present, align the reader with the temporality of endurance. The turn in the passage to Jem links the " never " of being stalked to the " never " of remaining unvisited ; we might wonder with Mary not only where Jem is but also, outside her consciousness and apparently the novel 's as well, how long he has really been away. # The answer lies, perhaps, in other linked plots of professional transformation and class transcendence. If the temporal probabilities of the marriage plot might cause us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short a time, those of the work plot seem actively to resist realist chronology. News of Jem and his progress comes to Mary through her friend Margaret, who has recently met him in Halifax. Margaret has to explain what Jem has been up to since Mary last saw him : " Well, he 's there in Halifax, however ; he 's putting up an engine for some folks there, for his master. He 's doing well, for he 's getten four or five men under him ; we 'd two or three meetings, and he telled me all about his invention for doing away wi ' the crank, or somewhat. His master 's bought it from him, and ta'en out a patent, and Jem 's a gentleman for life wi ' the money his master gied him "( pp. 165-6). While it is impossible to know how close we are to the end of Esther 's prison sentence as Margaret speaks these words, we can perhaps agree that things have gone improbably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numeracy of Gaskell 's narrator : " four or five men, " and " two or three meetings " remind us of the earlier description of " three or four little children " rolling about on the floor of the Davenport 's insalubrious cellar( p. 67). Although numbers are insisted upon, they are not precise. And, of course, they do not add up. All these numbers, all Jem 's accomplishments, could not make him " a gentleman for life " -even if he used every day of Esther 's incarceration to move to Halifax, invent a new kind of engine, show it to his master, patent it, get money for it, and become rich. While Esther does not get a life sentence, Jem has one pronounced for him by Margaret. His life and Esther 's month in prison make for a temporal mismatch.16 # The point here is not to belabor the temporal inconsistencies of Gaskell 's first full-length novel or to treat them as the errors in narrative construction that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the contrast between Esther 's slow carceral time and the relentless, propulsive speed of the marriage and work plots to think through the problem of the simultaneity effect and the narrative ethics of coevality that entangle themselves in that problem. Despite Gaskell 's juxtaposition of the marriage plot with Mary 's, Esther 's, and Jem 's different kinds and rhythms of waiting, the novel does not grant coevality to Esther. The chapters marking Esther 's imprisonment resolutely do not grant her a narrative present. # Readers-especially, perhaps, re-readers-of Mary Barton could, theoretically, " grant " that coevality, working against the temporal grain of the novel. This process could constitute a useful thought experiment. A reader committed to the coeval could try consciously to remind herself of Esther 's incarceration at key moments in the other plots by insisting on local moments of " while " within the structural meanwhile. This might mean mentally adding reminder sentences like this : # Gaskell. Mary lay half across the dresser, her head hidden in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobs, Reader. while her Aunt Esther unraveled rope and scarred her hands. # OR # Gaskell. He 's doing well, for he 's getten four or five men under him ; we 'd two or three meetings... Jem 's a gentleman for life wi ' the money his master gied him. # Reader. Esther was not doing so well. She spent several hours a day on the treadmill at the New Bailey. It was probably disconnected from the power generator and was used merely as aform of punishment. She was not allowed to communicate with her relatives outside and may have spent time in the new solitary room at the prison.17 # Critics of this thought experiment might argue that it takes us dangerously close to imagining children for Lady Macbeth, to forgetting that we are not reading about real people but that, crucially, we are reading fiction. While I would by no means propose coeval reading as a normative practice, I find it useful to imagine what it might feel like to impersonate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows us to think about what I prefer to call the politics of the novel, but also because it actually alerts us to the constructedness of its temporal technologies. # But perhaps this well-meaning thought experiment serves only to simplify the novel 's canny relation to time. In the moment of Esther 's release from prison, the narrator seems to admit and, indeed, to insist upon the impossibility of coevality : " The month was over ; -the honeymoon to the newly-married ; the exquisite convalescence to the ' living mother of a living child ' ; ' the first dark days of nothingness ' to the widow and the child-bereaved ; the term of penance, of hard labour, and of solitary confinement, to the shrinking, shivering, hopeless prisoner "( p. 184). This compressed passage brings together-only to hold temporally separate-a series of women not directly represented in the text, the weight of whose experience of time pushes down, as it were, on the " shrinking, shivering, hopeless prisoner " who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines is represented as relative, radically incommensurate, and the experience of time is only ironized by the imposition of markers like months or days. As the passage unfolds time gets slower and harder, phrases longer and more difficult. Although these lines are attentive to women in different circumstances, it would be hard to read them as conferring a present tense on the women whose stories unfold within it : after the initial phrase " the month was over, " the passage, made up as it is of apposite clauses, eschews verbs-even the repeated " living " is an adjective. Gaskell 's narrator seems to be not so much refusing coevality as demonstrating its limits, proposing within the meanwhile an idea of relative time. # If this transitional passage embodies a critique of the meanwhile through its complex syntax, a single-and simpler-sentence a few pages later condenses the project of relative time and moves it into the family and out of a collective of women. The narrator reminds the reader of Esther 's initial attempt to contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had, as we have seen, known where to meet with John Barton on that unfortunate night, which had only produced irritation in him, and a month 's imprisonment to her "( pp. 185-6). The parallel between " irritation in him " and " a month 's imprisonment to her " is embedded in contrasting temporalities : the transience of " irritation " and the slow duration of incarceration. One is a feeling and the other an experience ; both are caught up in contrasting passages of time. # At the moment of release, Esther enters another plot with a powerful temporality of its own. As a figure in the fallen-woman plot, Esther must, it seems, accede to the exigencies of belatedness and finality. When she meets Jem on the street after leaving the New Bailey, he tries to persuade her to reform and to " come home. " Esther responds " with accents of deep despair " : " God bless you, Jem, for the words you have just spoken. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope and trust you will save Mary. But it is too late now ; -too late "( p. 191). Esther 's understanding of Mary 's relation to temporality is, of course, belated : Mary has already been saved by her love of Jem. Esther misreads the marriage plot by failing to understand how far it has progressed in her enforced absence. Although Esther does not at this point know that Mary is already safe from her aunt 's sexual fate, she does position Mary within a potentially redemptive plot embodied in the temporal marker " yet. " Mary is saved in time and into the timeliness of the marriage plot. # Esther herself is doomed ; if her incarceration involved an exemption from the time of the novel, ironically her release plunges her into one of the fastest moving canonical plots that will end in drunkenness, disease, and death, but not before the novel revisits her in prison to flesh out the time of her waiting. The novel allows-indeed insists upon-this " outcast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the reader( p. 185). What Esther remembers, or at least recounts, about prison are the dreams she had there, in which her mother, daughter, and sister, all dead, enter her cell to reproach her : " It is so frightful to see them... There they go round and round my bed the whole night through. My mother, carrying little Annie( I wonder how they got together) and Mary-and all looking at me with their sad, stony eyes "( p. 192). This is the continuous present of delirium tremens narrating repeated moments when past and present collapse. Esther 's mother carries in her arms the grandchild she has never met ; the name " Mary " suggests both the dead sister and the imperiled niece. The outcast prostitute tells her tale through the hard time of incarceration. Despite the temporal complexities of Esther 's " tale, " however, and despite her disturbance of narrative time, the prostitute 's story finally gets absorbed into the hegemonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, always already at work. Ultimately, Mary is protected, not only from becoming Esther but also from inhabiting her hard time. # II. GLOBAL TIMES # My second and quite different text, Trollope 's " The Journey to Panama, " can be read as an experiment in and with relative time on a scale very different from that of Mary Barton. Shorter in length and larger in geographic reach, " Journey " follows the route of two steam packets : the first from Southampton to St. Thomas and the other from St. Thomas to Panama. As a short story, " Journey " offers different possibilities and challenges than does Gaskell 's Mary Barton. As a novelist of the English provinces, Trollope uses the short-story form to explore the world beyond his imaginary but familiar English landscapes. While his novels make incursions into the foreign, exemplifying for Lauren M. E. Goodlad the " actually existing cosmopolitanisms " of the Victorian period, his short stories linger as long as they can in the political and epistemological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be many reasons that the short stories are in one sense bigger than the novels, one such reason might ironically be the absence of competing plots and, perhaps, even the( relative) absence of the marriage plot. While Trollope 's novels-even, famously, his experiment in resistance, the provocatively titled Miss Ma.ckenzie-end with marriage, many of his short stories do not, concluding instead with heterosexual impasse and, in the case of his " The Banks of the Jordan, " misrecognition. Although the thematics of marriage are ever-present and suggest lingering traces of the marriage plot, that plot itself loses its narrative supremacy, as Trollope unbinds his stories from its exigencies. The famously singular focus of the short story can, oddly, open up new possibilities for the representation of simultaneity.19 # " Journey " begins with a juxtaposition of two temporalities, each with a complicated relationship to ships and to travel. Since so much in the story 's first paragraph is about rhythm and pace, the passage is worth quoting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in which men and women of the present day frequently find themselves for a time existing, so unlike their customary conventional life, as that experienced on board the large ocean steamers. On the voyages so made, separate friendships are formed and separate enmities are endured... But the enjoyments and activity of such a life do not display themselves till the third or fourth day of the voyage. The men and women at first regard each with distrust and ill-concealed dislike. They by no means anticipate the strong feelings which are to arise, and look forward to ten, fifteen, or twenty days of gloom or sea-sickness. Sea-sickness disappears, as a general condition, on the evening of the second day, and the gloom about noon on the fourth. Then the men begin to think that the women are not so ugly, vulgar, and insipid ; and the women drop their monosyllables. and become affable, perhaps even beyond their wont on shore. And alliances spring up among the men themselves. On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard each other with marked aversion... but by the fourth day, if not sooner, every man has his two or three intimate friends with whom he talks and smokes. The female friendships are slower in their growth, for the suspicion of women is perhaps stronger than that of men ; but when grown they also are stronger, and exhibit themselves sometimes in instances of feminine affection. #( p. 349) # This passage is precisely about passage, both of time and of passengers. Although friendships form quickly and according to a set calendar, the paragraph itself takes a while to arrive at the moment when the men stop thinking the women are ugly and when the women " become affable. " The calendar of shipboard time is laid out with an oddly leisurely imprecision : although we are told with exactness that " sea-sickness disappears. on the evening of the second day " and the passengers ' " gloom about noon on the fourth, " other temporal markers are less precise. The " enjoyments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till the third or fourth day, " and passengers " look forward to ten, fifteen, or twenty days of gloom. " This more inexact accounting reminiscent of Gaskell 's enumeration of the poor extends to the calculus of friendship itself : " by the fourth day, if not sooner, every man has his two or three intimate friends. " Men and women aboard ship have different timetables of intimacy : men make friends more quickly, but women have " stronger " friendships that are not represented numerically. # The largely, but not exclusively, homosocial temporalities of the narrator 's opening timetable give way to the special rhythms of heterosexual romance : " But the most remarkable alliances are those made between gentlemen and ladies. This is a matter of course on board ship quite as much as on shore, and it is of such an alliance that the present tale purports to tell the story. Such friendships, though they may be very dear, can seldom be very lasting. Though they may be full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discomforts of a seavoyage-such romance is generally short-lived and delusive, and occasionally is dangerous "( p. 349). Although subject to the accelerated timetables of shipboard life, heterosexual " friendships " resist the temporal requirements of the marriage plot. They exist, they can be " very dear, " but they do not last. They are not even presented as romances-as we shall see later, that word is used for other things-but rather as " friendships " or " alliances. " In using variants on " alliance " twice in this paragraph, Trollope 's narrator seems to borrow from a world outside of and larger than the marriage plot. # It is, of course, this larger world of competing nations and global histories that this steamship and others traverse. Interestingly, the word " romance " appears first in " Journey " to describe not relationships between men and women but shipping routes : # There are several of these great ocean routes, of which by the common consent, as it seems, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Great Eastern line, running from Southampton across the Bay of Biscay and up the Mediterranean. It crosses the Isthmus of Suez, and branches away to Australia, to India, to Ceylon, and to China. There is the great American line, traversing the Atlantic to New York and Boston with the regularity of clockwork. The voyage here is so much a matter of everyday routine, that romance has become scarce upon the route. There are one or two other North American lines, perhaps open to the same objection. Then there is the line of packets to the African coast, -very romantic as I am given to understand ; and there is the great West-Indian route, to which the present little history is attached, -great, not on account of our poor West Indian Islands, which can not at the present moment make anything great, but because it spreads itself out from thence to Mexico and Cuba, to Guiana and the republics of Grenada and Venezuela, to Central America, the Isthmus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Island, Peru and Chili. #( pp. 349-50) # If friendships develop in shipboard time aboard specific steamers, it is the movement of these steamers through mapped and named space that produces, or fails to produce, romance. Most " romantic " are the steamer routes to Africa, which seem to lie outside the narrator 's experience and mapping. The West Indian route that reaches to and beyond Panama, and that is the subject of " the present little history " -and also of Trollope 's own journeys as described in The West Indies and the Spanish Main-is also, apparently, romantic, but not because of the islands that give the route its name and point of origin. Romance attaches to the vast reach of the routes and to the place names carefully detailed as their landmarks. Both the story that " Journey " is in the process of telling and the West Indies from which the story and the journey launch are given a narrative present, even if " our poor West Indian Islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " unable to " make anything great. " While journeys to the places named and listed as destinations are indicated in a continuous present( " spreads "), the names of those places exist outside time, or at least outside any temporal markers. # The timelessness of geographical markers is undercut by the movement away from place to people, from routes to passengers. The people boarding the steamer carry with them compressed national histories of conflict, conquest, and subjugation : # It may be imagined how various are the tribes which leave the shores of Great Britain by this route. There are Frenchmen for the French sugar islands, as a rule not very romantic ; there are old Spaniards, Spaniards of Spain, seeking to renew their fortunes amidst the ruins of their former empire ; and new Spaniards, -Spaniards, that is, of the American republics, who speak Spanish, but are unlike the Don both in manners and physiognomy, -men and women with a touch perhaps of Indian blood, very keen after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life. There are Dutchmen too, and Danes, going out to their own islands. There are citizens of the stars and stripes, who find their way everywhere-and, alas! perhaps, now also citizens of the new Southern flag, with the palmetto leaf. And there are Englishmen of every shade and class, and Englishwomen also. #( p. 340) # However problematic Trollope 's representation of the various nationalities on board the steamer, he does not present them in any sense as being out of time.20 There are " old Spaniards " associated with a decaying " former " empire and with attempts to " renew " it in the present moment. There are also " new Spaniards " perhaps more entangled in present and future tenses and enterprises. There are Americans, also subject to recent history at the moment this story is written in 1861. The " perhaps " suggests the instability of the Confederacy ; the " alas, " the narrator 's self-insertion into an unfolding present. Structured as a list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of temporal terms that cuts across national identities. Somewhat curiously, this passage binds passengers not only to their nations of origin but also to the earlier discussion of routes : in this list of descriptive phrases we are told that the French are " not very romantic. " # Thus the opening of Trollope 's short story offers a variety of competing temporalities ; the paradoxical stasis and acceleration of shipboard time is played out against the relative time of national histories. " Journey " begins by positing the temporalities of land and sea, colonizer and colonized, and the local and the global. It is not too much to say that the short story starts out as a thought experiment about the possibility of simultaneity and about the limits and possibility of the simultaneity effect. Since the genre of the short story is less insistently bound to the marriage plot, since this particular short story explicitly refuses from the beginning to accede to that plot 's gestures toward closure, and since romance is attached to vastly different temporalities, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sustained exploration of relative time within the dominant temporality of what Jessie E. C. Reeder and Robert D. Aguirre would call " informal " empire, with its particular relation to speed, industrialization, and global communication.21 # Perhaps predictably, the story quickly forecloses the possibilities of relative time(s) by narrowing its sense of temporality and reinstalling the story of individual sexual romance, indicatively English. If the long passenger list quoted above makes English men something of an afterthought to the men of many nations and " English women also " an afterthought to those English men, " Journey " finally recalibrates Its ambitions to focus on one English man and one English woman. The French and the Dutch disappear from the story, while Spaniards are mentioned only twice and in passing. The narrative turns to tell the story of Ralph Forrest, bound for California after the death of his wife, and the impoverished Emily Viner, bound for Peru to marry a man she hardly knows. Their story unfolds not in the context of a cosmopolitan relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, which manages, despite seasickness and unfamiliarity, to mimic life on land and to achieve what Janet C. Myers has called a " portable domesticity. " 22 The success of this enterprise depends in part on the marking of time in ways reminiscent of English domestic life : " The custom on board these ships is for two bells to ring preparatory to dinner, at an interval of half-an-hour. At the sound of the first, ladies would go to their cabins to adjust their toilets ; but as dressing for dinner is not carried to an extreme at sea, these operations are generally over before the second bell, and the lady passengers would generally assemble in the balcony for some fifteen minutes before dinner. At first they would stand here alone, but by degrees they were joined by some of the more enterprising of the men, and so at last a kind of little drawingroom was formed "( " Journey, " p. 354).23 The English passengers carve a space out of time and an identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " London time " of Ericka Beckman 's essay in this volume.24 # Emily and Ralph are, as an item of gossip, simultaneously subject to the standardized time of bells and dinner hours and outside its limits. At first Ralph conforms exactly to the temporality of attraction laid down by the narrator and echoed by his friend Morris, who, with the wisdom gained from previous sea voyages, tells Ralph early on that Emily will become more attractive as the journey progresses : " She 'll brighten up wonderfully before we 're in the tropics... And you wo n't find her so very bad then "( p. 352). A little later, Morris rearticulates his confidence in the erotic powers of shipboard time, claiming, " No ; she wo n't be lovely for the next three days to come, I dare say. By the time you reach Panama, she 'll be all that is perfect in a woman. I know how these things go "( p. 354). Soon-perhaps even before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers become uneasy and judgmental about the relationship they see developing. Despite Emily 's efforts to avoid Ralph, the two become friends : " And then... on that evening, there grew up between them something like the confidence of real friendship. Things were told such as none but friends do tell to one another... Alas, they were both foolish ; for friendship and sympathy should have deeper roots "( pp. 355-6). The narrator here seems to push against the accelerated temporality of the relationship. Like the English passengers he depicts so negatively, he seems to disapprove of the shape and pace of this " friendship. " With all eyes on the developing relationship between Ralph and Emily, the scope of the piece narrows to exclude all non-English passengers. # And, indeed, the story narrows further as the steamer reaches St. Thomas and Emily and Ralph are the only English people to take a second ship to Panama. The English passengers lose interest as their destination approaches : " Few of the passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirer. Those who were going down to Panama were mostly Spaniards, and as the great separation became nearer, people had somewhat else of which to think "( p. 357). The " great separation " serves to isolate the couple further ; we hear nothing of the " Spaniards " who accompany them, and little even of the English " people " who have moved on to other things and other times. The two English friends might be alone on the second ship to Col&oacute;n : " On the following morning the branch ship was despatched to Mexico ; and then, on the afternoon of the third day that for Colon-as we Englishmen call the town on this side of the Isthmus of Panama. Into that vessel Miss Viner and Mr. Forrest moved themselves and their effects ; and now that the three-headed Cerberus was gone, she had no longer hesitated in allowing him to do for her all those little things which it is well that men should do for women when they are travelling "( p. 358 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " she had no longer hesitated " suggests the inevitability of Emily 's acceptance of Ralph 's attentions. Offered in the continuous present as " little things which it is well that men should do, " those attentions take a different temporal and grammatical route to inevitability. It is through these inevitabilities that we might imagine the couple moving with the tide of the marriage plot. # Instead, the story offers a new form of shipboard time, precisely calculated but indicatively out of time. Emily counts down the days before landing : " I have five more days of self and liberty left me... That is my life 's allowance "( p. 358). When, after landing, she discovers that her fianc&eacute; is dead, Emily responds to Ralph 's proposal of marriage with a resonant " Not for the world "( p. 363). She explains : " While he lived, it seemed to me that in those last days I had a right to speak my thoughts plainly. You and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded us both as people apart, who for a while might drop the common usages of the world "( p. 363). Emily-insistently Miss Viner to Ralph until the end-posits a temporality, indeed a right to a temporality, that is outside standardized time, although it can be measured within its parameters. It is, perhaps shockingly, a temporality outside the marriage plot. As her repeated use of " world " reminds us, it is also a global temporality made possible by a change in latitude. For all its savvy deployment of temporalities, " Journey " finally collapses relative time into the forms of standard time. On the level of plot, this standardization derives from what is now firmly a romance-if distinctly not a marriage-plot. # This plot accelerates as the journey and the short story draw to a close and the text begins to deal in smaller units of time. " In little more than an hour " from the time the couple see land " the ship had swung round on her anchor " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " readers might feel with Emily the rush toward a conventional ending( p. 360). The speed of the prose echoes and is echoed by new terrain and new forms and procedures of transportation : Emily and Ralph leave the ship for the new railroad, which anticipates the route across the Isthmus of Panama to be cut some fifty years later by the Panama Canal. Railway time, even in this outpost, is ruthlessly efficient : " In less than an hour from their landing, their baggage had been examined by the Custom House officers of New Grenada, and they were on the railway cars, crossing the Isthmus "( p. 360). # British and American relations to the Isthmus were often focused on the idea of speed ; the depot town on the Isthmus 's northern coast is not a place to linger, at least for the British : # Colon, or Aspinwall as it should be called, is a place in itself as detestable as St. Thomas. It is not so odious to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than is necessary. We have no great depot of traffic there, which we might with advantage move elsewhere. Taken, however, on its own merits, Aspinwall is not a detestable place. Luckily, however, travellers across the Isthmus to the Pacific are never doomed to remain there long. If they arrive early in the day, the railway thence to Panama takes them on at once. If it be not so, they remain on board ship till the next morning. Of course it will be understood that the transit line chiefly affects Americans, as it is the highroad from New York to California. #( " Journey, " p. 360) # Although Trollope hints here at different temporalities for English and American travelers, the point of the town for both, and indeed the point of the Isthmus itself, is that they are places " in between. " The speed of the railway, and of global transport networks more generally, erases both town and Isthmus in the act of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case of Col&oacute;n, renamed. What Aguirre calls the " mobilities " of agents of informal empire, and what Reeder and Beckman call, in this issue, " flows " of capital, make the narrow strip of land disappear into imperial time.25 # As it turns out, the temporalities of informal empire, embodied in the railway, do not, finally, merge with those of the marriage plot. Instead, Emily must, unmarried, reenter the slow time of shipboard life, retracing her steps, first on the railroad, then back to St. Thomas on her way to England. Although Ralph proposes to her, she resists the convergence of love, time, and plot precisely because she has treated Ralph as being outside conventional temporal markers. The arrangements for Emily 's return journey are made quickly ; for both Ralph and reader, they are faits accomplis in the final scene. Narrative time, then, is out of joint with the time of Emily 's return. That return time, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Trollope and, even in Trollope, unrepresented in narrative. It is a retreat from the marriage plot along the tracks laid down for it by sea and by land. Footnote # NOTES # 1 Mapping the various disciplinary uses of the idea of simultaneity is a daunting task. I can offer only some suggestions. For historians, phenomena that happen at the same time are embodied and rendered meaningful through the synchronic axis of history. I have argued elsewhere that the synchronic and diachronic axes of history are inherently incommensurate in terms of scale, and that the narrative turn in history has cemented a privileging of the diachronic axis leaving the synchronic axis undertheorized as it contributes to our understanding of chronology and history( Helena Michie, " Victorian(ist) ' Whiles ' and the Tenses of Historicism, " Narrative 17, 3 October 2009 : 274-90, 279). Cognitive scientists tend to use the word " simultaneity " to investigate events unfolding on a neural level. Recent experiments with fMRIs have shown simultaneity to be an illusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this reason, many cognitive-based works in philosophy and psychology tend to think in terms of " delay " or " staggered time. " See Susie Vrobel, Otto E. R&ouml;ssler, and Terry Marks-Tarlow, eds., Simultaneity : Temporal Structures and Observer Perspective( Hackensack NJ : World Scientific Press, 2008), esp. Uri Fildelman 's " Brain Time and Physical Time, " pp. 79-87. This idea of delay is also discussed in philosopher Jay Lampert 's Simultaneity and Delay : A Dialectical Theory of Staggered Time( New York : Continuum, 2012), pp. 112-5. While preserving the idea of simultaneity for structuring perception, physics has offered us the word " entanglement " for the behavior of paired electrons that carry out a mysterious relation, even when at an unimaginable distance apart. This word has caught on in anthropology to describe the ethnographic condition of inhabiting two positions at once. Thus, Faye Ginsburg and Rayna Rapp speak of " entangled ethnography " to describe their dual roles as professional ethnographers and parents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Future for Young Adults with Learning Disabilities, " Social Science and Medicine 99 2013 : 187-93). Perhaps similar to this use of the idea of simultaneous identities is the concept of " intersectionality " that has been central to feminist studies for the last twenty-five years( see Robyn Warhol and Susan S. Lanser, eds., Narrative Theory Unbound : Queer and Feminist Interventions Columbus : Ohio State Univ. Press, 2015). An older term from anthropology is Johannes Fabian 's " coeval, " used to indicate ethical temporal relation between ethnographers and indigenous subjects( Time and the Other : How Anthropology Makes Its Object New York : Columbia Univ. Press, 2002, pp. 30-3). Finally, literary studies has relatively recently focused on the idea of the " meanwhile, " particularly in the multiplot novel. For a foundational discussion, see Peter K. Garrett, The Victorian Multiplot Novel : Studies in Dialogical Form( New Haven : Yale Univ. Press, 1980).

While some of his novels, notably The Bertrams( 1859) and John Caldigate( 1879), actually involve travel, much of his longer fiction treats non-English spaces instrumentally. Trollope 's novel about Panama, The Way We Live Now( 1875), features an economic and moral relation to the Panamanian railroad but does not, as it were, leave London.
