4008241 Section : THE ENVIORNMENTAL FACTOR <p> " The environmental and social problems of the Amazon are rooted in the economic trade-offs faced by a developing country seeking improved welfare, land distribution policy, labor productivity and income distribution, with only recent progress in political stabilization. " <p> Until recently, variations in seasonal-to-annual climate were thought to be impossible to predict with any degree of certainty. Since the 1980s, however, that situation has changed significantly. The international community now has the capacity to predict shifts in seasonal rainfall and temperature for many regions of the tropics. The ability to forecast probable shifts a season to a year ahead is an important scientific breakthrough that offers the potential to help vulnerable tropical regions to cope better with natural variations that greatly affect the livelihoods of populations, especially relating to agriculture, health and water resources. Skillful climate forecasts can also help advance environmentally sustainable development over the longer haul by aiding in planning that reduces massive relocations of vulnerable populations that impose critical stresses on impacted social and ecological environments. Improved adaptation on seasonal-to-annual time scales will inform adaptation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the significant progress to date, the routine use of climate information and forecasts to help developing countries cope with climate variability is at present more promise than reality. Climate is just one factor contributing to multifaceted socio-political problems that can lead to massive relocations of vulnerable populations. Regional climate information systems require more comprehensive and informed development to build the trust that is critical to the use of climate information to inform decision-making in challenging environments. Partnerships must build capability in affected regions, with research agendas that comprehend and address social need. 2 <p> Increased understanding of climate-influence may aid decision opportunities, specifically for the case of Northeast Brazil. To assess these possibilities, it is useful to review seasonal climate elements and information systems and present a historic summary of developments over the last century in Northeast Brazil. The semi-arid state of Cear, whose development has been constrained by the limited availability of water and high variability in its supply, is a case in point. WORKING WITH NATURAL VARIATIONS IN SEASONAL CLIMATE <p> For many regions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of ocean surface temperature on atmospheric circulation. The best-documented and most important oceanic influence on the atmosphere is El Nio. The term El Nio was first coined more than 100 years ago to describe the unusually warm waters that would occasionally form along the coast of Ecuador and Peru. This phenomenon typically occurred late in the calendar year near Christmas, hence the name El Nio( Spanish for " the boy child, " referring to the Christ child). Today the term El Nio is used to refer to a much broader-scale phenomenon associated with unusually warm water that occasionally forms across much of the tropical eastern and central Pacific. The time between successive El Nio events is irregular, but they typically tend to recur every three to seven years. <p> La Nia, the counterpart to El Nio, is characterized by a shift to unusually cool water across much of the equatorial eastern and central Pacific. A La Nia event often, but not always, follows an El Nio and vice versa. Once developed, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for roughly a year, although occasionally they may persist for 18 months or more. El Nio and La Nia( ENSO-El Nio Southern Oscillation) are both a normal part of the earth 's climate ; there is recorded evidence of their having occurred for thousands of years. <p> The evolution of a typical ENSO episode takes place over several months. The single most important type of seasonal climate information relates to understanding the current state of the equatorial Pacific Ocean. Great improvements in our understanding of the climate system have occurred because of increased attention to observations of the climate system and the enhanced ability to interpret those observations. For instance, much of the potential to prepare for ENSO-related climate impacts comes from an ability to observe and recognize its early stages. Much of our understanding of ENSO itself was made possible by observations from a system of moored buoys, called the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean array, across the equatorial Pacific, originated in the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Program in the mid-1980s, 3 which has since become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observational array, called PIRATA, in the Tropical Atlantic with hopes that it will lead to comparable understanding of climate variability, especially in Africa and South America. 4 <p> The next most important information relates to understanding and interpreting the future state of this ocean basin through the latest ENSO and sea surface temperature forecasts and outlooks. Seasonal forecasts of global rainfall and temperature patout-terns are generated through a suite of computer models at several centers around the world. It is essential that several sources of seasonal climate forecasts be considered, as individual prediction system performance varies by region and season at different times as initial conditions vary. 5 Many computer models and statistical techniques of varying complexity have shown skill in predicting the evolution of the equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature associated with ENSO for both El Nio and La Nia. 6 However, virtually all of these studies also suggest that ENSO techniques have some difficulties in predicting the details of the onset, magnitude and demise of ENSO episodes. <p> No single information source is adequate for the characterization of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Climate Information System that includes the following components : 7 Reliable and complete climate observations in real time, Complete and error-free climate data archives to provide a basis for placing the observations into historical context, Complete real-time analyses of current climate data, Access to current climate forecasts from a variety of sources, Easy-to-understand forecast products, Complete records and analyses of past forecast performance, Routine methods for disseminating climate information to user groups and sectors and Active collaboration and feedback from the user community. Conceptual View of a Climate Information System <p> The Climate Information System should include mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating the accuracy of sea surface temperature forecasts and related precipitation and temperature forecasts produced by a variety of methods. This may be as simple as having the System access the evaluations performed by various research and academic institutions. Information on forecast model accuracy is essential to safeguard against false alarms, i.e., forecasts of El Nio or La Nia based on models that have poor historical performance under certain initial conditions. <p> The end aim is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the hands of appropriate users in a timely enough fashion to have some influence on practical decisions. This can only be accomplished if the spatial scales of climate modeling and forecast and those of the decision-makers are compatible and if dissemination of climate information is properly addressed. It will do society no good if the results of climate applications research remain in the academic or research arena. Considerable efforts are required to move from global to regional climate forecasts( or downscaling of climate forecasts, in the climate sciences jargon) and to develop the appropriate means for the effective dissemination of climate information. The producers of climate information generally do not have easy and direct access to the end users of that information ; in practice the mechanisms for dissemination need to be developed through a range of organizations and structures. These could range from national meteorological services, who generally have a well-defined set of users, to representatives of the ministries or government organizations who advise user communities-e.g., public health, agriculture, water resources, risk/hazard management and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the world has been experiencing a progressive understanding of climate processes and the development of a general framework for the analysis and use of climate information. The natural step to take next is to pursue the implementation of such a framework actively in cases of relevance to society. The potential for socially meaningful applications of climate information and forecast in the state of Cear, Northeast Brazil, is a case in point. Effective use of climate information and forecasts in Cear can produce social benefits that surpass the local level and provide guidance to the international community on the application of climate forecasts. THE BRAZILIAN NORTHEAST <p> Severe droughts in the Brazilian Northeast remain one of the major factors negatively affecting the welfare of local populations. In recent decades, the aggregate measures of economic activity of the Northeast have become less sensitive to climate variability, but the same is not true for a large portion of the population that depends on low-productivity rain-fed agriculture and is still vulnerable to extreme climate. <p> The human catastrophes associated with extreme droughts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portions of the region. Not all the Northeast is semi-arid. In fact, agriculture near the costal areas of the region is viable and constituted the first major source of riches in the colony, namely the export of sugar produced in the sugar cane plantations of the Northeast. Effective colonization of Brazil by the Portuguese started more than two decades after its discovery in 1500 with the production and export of sugar cane, an activity that prevailed in the Brazilian economy for more than a century and is still present in the Northeast. This activity, concentrated in the humid coastal zone of Northeast, spurred the colonization of the semi-arid interior. The interior of the Northeast produced agricultural surpluses for the coastal export economy and gained relative importance later in the seventeenth century when Brazilian sugar exports collapsed due to external competition. Subsistence agriculture became an alternative, even though it implied an involution of the local economy, or " the exact opposite of growth and development. " 8 The colonization of the semi-arid Northeast inaugurated an era of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for policies and actions that would reduce such vulnerability. Although droughts were reported in the Northeast from the early years of the region 's colonization, only in the second half of the nineteenth century did Brazilian officials initiate systematic thinking on the problem and design policies to tackle the effects of extreme climate. <p> In 1877, a " very strong " El Nio year, 9 the region experienced a devastating drought that lasted until 1879 and claimed more than 100,000 lives. 10 This event was a turning point in the mobilization of resources and design of policies to tackle the problem of droughts in the Brazilian Northeast. At that time, the Brazilian emperor Don Pedro II nominated a national commission to study the droughts in the Northeast and produce recommendations for actions to mitigate their effects. The commission recommended the construction of reservoirs, wells and a canal to transport water from the Sao Francisco River to the areas of the Northeast most affected. The commission also recommended that access to the region be improved, so that the local populations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played an important role in government intervention in later years. Thousands of reservoirs of a variety of sizes and capacities have been constructed throughout the Northeast, and access to the region has improved dramatically <p> As a result of the studies and recommendations from the end of the nineteenth century, a number of institutions were also created for the purpose of better understanding and managing the effects of droughts in the Northeast. In 1906 the Federal government of Brazil inaugurated the so-called hydro phase of the Northeast with the creation of the Superintendncia dos Estudos e Obras Contra os Efeitos das Secas to promote studies and construction projects that would mitigate the effects of droughts. This institution changed names twice before its current designation as Departamento Nacional de Obras Contra as Secas( DNOCS) in 1945. DNOCS has been responsible for the implementation of a vast water related infrastructure enabling the storage of 22 billion cubic meters of water in the Northeast. <p> The hydro phase helped increase the resilience of the local populations in the face of droughts through the storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would promote local agriculture and improve the livelihood of the population. Antnio R. Magalhaes summarized the rationale behind this phase of government intervention as follows : " the problem was lack of water, so the solution was to accumulate water. " 11 This view drew questions in the 1940s with the so-called ecological phase. The new formula was to promote rational and efficient agriculture with the introduction of vegetation and animal species that were more resistant to the reduced availability of water. <p> Parallel to the agricultural focus of the ecological phase, the experiences of the 1940s and 1950s gave rise to a new theory for the development of the Northeast. According to this new theory, vulnerability to droughts was due both to the region 's dependence on low-productivity agriculture and to the obstacles to development of dynamic local industries. A major obstacle to industrial development was the lack of energy generation and distribution. This led to the creation of the Companhia Hidreltrica do Sao Francisco( CHESF) to make use of the hydroelectric potential of the Sao Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the energy produced and distributed in the Northeast. In a stark departure from the philosophy of accumulation of water to solve the problem of droughts, the federal government created, along the lines of its promotion of local industrial development, the Banco do Nordeste do Brasil S/A( BNB). The opening of the bank during the drought of 1951 to 1953 aimed at strengthening the region 's financial sector and promoting investment in key activities for the Northeast 's economic growth. BNB was conceived as a development bank with access to one-third of the 3 percent of the federal tax revenues designated by the federal constitution to be devoted to a fund for droughts. <p> BNB was the basis for the creation of the Superintendncia de Desenvolvimento do Nordeste( SUDENE) in 1959. SUDENE, intended as a focal institution for the development of the Northeast, was to promote industrialization, stimulate food production in the humid areas, promote agriculture adapted to dry conditions the semi-arid areas and explore the agricultural frontiers of the region. 12 To do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for firms to operate in the Northeast. <p> The emphasis on promotion of development of the Northeast rooted in dynamic industries accorded with national policies targeting import substitution industrialization( ISI). The argument for ISI was that Brazil was in the world periphery and depended on more developed nations through the import of manufactures. Because exports of primary goods were the source of Brazilian reserves, and the prices of these goods rose more slowly than those of imports, Brazil 's purchasing power grew progressively worse. The country became less able to accumulate resources critical for development. The solution was then to restrict imports and stimulate a national industry that would reduce the nation 's dependence on industrialized countries. <p> Ironically, the ISI policy reproduced within the country the international scenario it refuted. By targeting investments in the wealthier Southeast, not only did ISI deepen regional imbalances in the country, but it also promoted the transfer of assets from the backward Northeast to the Southeast from the late 1940s to late 1960s. 13 The Northeast 's exports exceeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this trade surplus translated into transfers to the Southeast. Strong restrictions on imports imposed by the ISI policies and the slower pace of industrialization of the Northeast, forced the region to import from the Southeast, thus raising its dependence within the country. Such transfers of foreign earnings to other regions of the country were reported to be about 40 percent of total foreign earnings from the Northeast. 14 <p> The pattern of transfer of assets from the Northeast to the Southeast and the concentration of investments in the latter region contributed to the delay of economic development in the semi-arid region and to the perpetuation of its vulnerability to frequent climatic shocks. This phenomenon was clear to the economist Celso Furtado, who was instrumental in the original creation of SUDENE in 1959. 15 Furtado recognized that despite federal aid to the Northeast in years of drought, there were substantial outflows of private capital. 16 The unintended negative effect of the ISI policies on the development of the Northeast is a good example of the role of the institutional setting in magnifying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development of the Northeast next shifted in the 1970s. It took another calamitous drought( 1970) to promote institutional changes to address the country 's regional imbalances. The military government attempted to implement a broad program of regional integration( Programa de Integraao Nacional-PIN) to integrate the Northeast and the Amazon better with the rest of the country. The infamous Transamaznica road was built, connecting the Northeast to the new agricultural frontier : the Amazon. At the same time, government rhetoric included land reform and promotion of an old comparative advantage of the Northeast, the production of sugar cane. <p> Two notable factors stand out in the legacy of 1970s central government policies toward the Northeast. First, their rationale highlights the social variable in the development process of the Northeast. The 1970s witnessed the conception of integrated programs of local development, including meteorology, efficient land use, education, health, water management, sanitation, irrigation, transportation, access to energy and the like. Their goal was to promote employment, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These programs also marked the stronger involvement of international institutions such as the World Bank and the InterAmerican Development Bank. 17 Second, the development policies of the 1970s exacerbated the supra-regional character of the recurrent droughts in the Brazilian semi-arid region by improving connections between the Amazon region and the rest of the country( especially the Northeast). That is, the federal integration programs that promoted socio-economic and environmental impacts with repercussions at the national level also caught the attention of the international community regarding degradation of the Amazon as a problem with national and global impacts. <p> The migratory flow from the Northeast to the Amazon dates from the late 1800s, following the juxtaposition of two important events : the rubber boom in the Amazon and the great drought of 1877-80 in the Northeast. Jan Bitoun and his colleagues report massive migration from the Northeast, 18 especially from Cear, 19 to the Amazon between the beginning of the boom and the first decades of the twentieth century. This migratory flow waned after the collapse of the rubber economy20 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socio-economic factors : the major drought of 1970 and government policies aimed at integrating the Amazon into the rest of the country. Colonization of the Amazon was seen as a way to promote more equalized growth in the country. Expansion of the national agricultural frontier would provide an alternative to poor families in the dry Northeast and in the crowded South and Southeast. The northeastern states of Maranhao and Cear contributed to more than two-thirds of the immigrants into the Amazon region in the 1970s and 1980s. 21 <p> Deforestation increased due to the intense migration from all Brazilian regions, especially the Northeast, into the Amazon. In addition to migration, Alex Pfaff shows that development policies and financial incentives are also key determinants of deforestation. 22 Beyond the well-publicized environmental impacts, migration imposed significant social impacts in the region. 23 Brazilian land-holding practices, 24 income inequality and low labor productivity in depressed areas were important contributing factors. In particular, Lee J. Alston and his colleagues present convincing evidence that colonization of the Amazon, combined with unclear land-ownership rights25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulted in recent violent conflicts and accelerated deforestation in the region. <p> These findings, together with the migratory pressures in the Northeast, show how socio-economic forces have contributed to the spatial propagation of the effects of droughts well beyond the Brazilian semi-arid region and with global implications. The Amazon, recognized as an important variable in global climate, is also a largely untapped genetic bank with potential benefits for humanity. It is wrong to implicate the Northeast as the culprit in the plight of the Amazon region. The environmental and social problems of the Amazon are rooted in the economic tradeoffs faced by a developing country seeking improved welfare, land distribution policy, labor productivity and income distribution, with only recent progress in political stabilization. These are channels through which climatic shocks filter through Brazil and into the Amazon. <p> Better understanding of the dimensions and complexity of development of the Northeast culminated in a refocusing of development strategies in the early 1980s. The world experienced the second oil crisis, and Brazil shifted politically to a democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the payment of its external debt. Concurrently, this combination of events undermined the refocusing effort of the 1970s. Federal and local governments ' limited financial capabilities and political resistance to the planning tradition of the military government contributed to a reduced involvement of public power in shaping the development of the Northeast. Despite these trends, Gustavo M. Gomes points out that during the 1980s, the northeastern economy grew faster than that of the rest of the country. 26 The study attributes such growth to compensatory public investments and employment, which did little to increase the region 's productivity. Rather, it resulted in increased dependence on the Southeast for the supply of goods and services and on the federal and local governments for generation of wealth. Clearly, the model of the 1980s failed to break the region 's cycle of vulnerability to climate variation. <p> For economic and political reasons, the 1980s became known as the lost decade, even though the term is not really appropriate given the profound transformations that led the country from a military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources from the federal government to local and state governments. This resulted in more autonomy for local governments and fewer opportunities for coordinated strategic actions for the development of the country. The price of autonomy for the Northeast was the diffusion of resources and reduced involvement by the federal government. <p> As the country emerges from its political and economic challenges, it is worthwhile to establish mechanisms to stimulate further coordinated actions to tackle common problems of economic development and vulnerability to droughts in northeast Brazil. THE CASE OF CEARA STATE <p> The state of Cear occupies an area of 146,348 km and has three major geographical regions-the coastal zone( litoral), coastal mountain ranges( serra) and the predominant semi-arid region( sertao). Data from the 2000 census report a state population of 7,430,661, corresponding to 15.6 percent and 4.4 percent of the populations of the Northeast and Brazil respectively. 27 Cear is the third most heavily populated state in the Northeast-behind Bahia( 13.07 million) and Pernambuco( 7.92 million) -and its population is distributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's population is mostly concentrated in the metropolitan region of Fortaleza( 56 percent of the total), which also concentrates the largest share of the state economy. From 1970 to 1997, agriculture 's share of state GDP fell from 15.8 percent to 5.7 percent, whereas industry grew from 18.6 percent to 27.4 percent of GDP and services showed little variation from 65.7 to 66.9 percent. 28 Nevertheless, agriculture still accounted for 43.2 percent of employment in the state in 1996. Agricultural employment was largely low-productivity labor ; the agricultural population was highly vulnerable to climate variability. As a consequence of urbanization and internal migration to escape the impacts of droughts, rural population in the state has experienced an absolute decline since 1970. 29 <p> According to the World Bank, 49 percent of Cear 's population is living below the extreme( or food-only) poverty line( R$65 per month per capita-roughly US$75 using the PPP exchange rate for 2000), and such poverty is highest among rural workers and immigrants from rural areas on the periphery of Fortaleza. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Their alarming levels of poverty stem from inequitable distributions of land and income in Brazil in general and Cear in particular, coupled with low levels of education and labor productivity, occupation of semi-arid regions, and only recent and incipient process of political awareness and frequent climatic shocks. <p> Until the drought of 1987, Cear 's policies and programs to address catastrophic droughts were no different from those of the rest of the northeast. Emergency responses to droughts planned and executed by the federal government did not necessarily meet regional demands and needs. During the droughts of 1979 through 1983, emergency programs reduced emphasis on large construction projects that required workers to move and separate from their families. Instead, most actions consisted of preparing the land for when the rains resumed or performing smaller-scale construction projects within farms. One important side effect of this response was that it promoted only short-run solutions to the recurrent crises and, more important, delivered labor and government resources to larger farmers. This became the so-called drought industry, with strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vulnerability of the poor farmers to climate shocks. 31 Starting in 1981, emergency programs were oriented toward actions that benefited the affected communities instead of landowners. Overall, although the policies implemented from the 1950s through the early 1980s were successful in ending deaths due to droughts, they did present serious problems and distortions. Definition and execution of actions were greatly influenced by political interests. Planning was centralized at the national level. Actions responded only to catastrophes and were highly bureaucratic. The population did not participate in defining actions and there was little concern with long-run strategies to cope with the semi-arid region. 32 <p> In the late 1980s, Cear started to shift its internal politics. New state governments began to promote decentralization of the decision process with better local community participation. Fiscal oversight stimulated more professional public administration. Development policies fostered economic growth, reduced poverty and infant mortality and improved education. 33 These measures led to improved management of the 1987 drought. Affected communities participated in defining mitigating actions, responsible use of public resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the long run. 34 <p> The fiscal health of the state improved significantly during the 1980s ; Cear experienced years of budget surplus from 1991 to 1994( although the trend was reversed in 1995 and 1996). 35 Such promotion of fiscal responsibility was unparalleled in the state 's history as well as relative to other states in Brazil. By improved fiscal management, the state of Cear could advance productive public investments such as the construction of an industrial complex in the new Pecm Port, expansion of the state 's main airport, infrastructure to support increased tourism, construction of a large water reservoir( Castanhao), expansion of the system of energy transmission lines and improvements in transportation infrastructure. 36 Furthermore, the state adopted an aggressive policy of attracting industries based on tax incentives and improved social and demographic indicators. 37 These measures positively contributed to Cear 's reputation as a stable environment for business investments. Consequently, the state economy has become progressively less vulnerable to climate variability as reflected in the small impact of the recent droughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Despite the evident successes of recent governments in Cear, problems and policy distortions persist. Agriculture is responsible for over 40 percent of employment, mostly in low productivity activities that are highly vulnerable to droughts. Poverty is still extremely prevalent in the state and intimately connected with rain-fed agriculture. The expansion of industry is costly to the state to the extent that forgone tax revenues tend to be high, and industry has failed to create significantly increased employment opportunities for the rural poor. New industries as well as modern irrigated agriculture have significantly boosted the state economy but tend to be capital intensive, thus not adequately alleviating employment pressures. Labor in rural areas continues to be largely uneducated and with low levels of productivity. 38 <p> Recent development trends in Cear need to address some major bottlenecks. First, a large portion of the population remains extremely poor and vulnerable to droughts. Second, as the economy grows and the state continues in a process of urbanization, the demand for a reliable water supply increases. Better water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Third, long-term development and welfare policies based on improved education and labor productivity, as well as reliable social safety nets are essential for alleviation of poverty and for helping rural populations cope better in the semi-arid region. Fourth, there is limited fiscal headroom for the state and a pressing demand for public investments. 39 Cear faces the challenge of reinforcing fiscal responsibility and improving the efficiency of public expenditures. Fifth, economic development policies need to refocus on labor-intensive economic sectors with potentially large spillover effects that may contribute to reducing geographical economic concentrations. 40 <p> The context of Cear 's development and challenges imposed by recurrent severe droughts has set the stage for an aggressive research agenda geared to reducing climate vulnerability. Overall, the state of Cear constitutes an important sector of the globe for focusing applied research on the impacts of climate variability and strategies to cope with them. First, Cear has a large population highly vulnerable to climate variability. The impacts of frequent extreme droughts in the northeast in general, and Cear in particular, spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, with potential global impacts. Second, modern climate forecasting techniques have relative success in that region of the globe. 41 Global atmospheric models and modern statistical techniques have opened a largely unexplored window of opportunity to study and better manage the effects of climate variability. Furthermore, the resolution of climate forecasting at the regional level is advancing rapidly. Third, there is a demonstrated need for adaptation in institutional, socio-economic and water management systems, which are crucial for local development. Fourth, Cear counts on a political and technical institutional framework favorable to effective implementation of strategies designed for coping better with climate variability. These include long experience with strategies for tackling the problem of droughts from which much can be learned. CONCLUSIONS <p> Cear has a long history of government intervention to reduce the vulnerability of the rural subsistence farming population to climate variability. The government has provided guidance in the selection of crops, agricultural practices and land use. It has also developed social programs for drought relief and water and educational infrastructure. These have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to be concerns as Cear enters the twenty-first century. The reduction of poverty and illiteracy and the management of the transition to an urban, technology-driven economy are primary social objectives that need to be addressed simultaneously with constraints on the use of water and other natural resources. In this regard, the goals of Cear are similar to those of many developing countries in semi-arid environments. <p> Given the progressive outlook of the Cear government, an unprecedented opportunity exists to develop and implement guidance collaboratively for investments for the sustainable development of Cear. This can aid short-run emergency planning and both near- and long-term resource management. <p> Unlike many developing countries and regions, the state of Cear has invested in building a strong technical capability to understand and predict climate variations and their impacts. Since its inception, the IRI has been an active partner and facilitator of the research and implementation of climate models at the regional climate institute, Fundaao Cearense de Meteorologia e Recursos Hdricos( FUNCEME). This research has led to the recognition that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of climate at Cear is very good. The potential for forecasting river flows into the major reservoirs has also been demonstrated. Further, and as important as predictive skill, there exists political will among key decision-makers to use climate information regularly to reduce the recurrent stresses to poor, rural producers, as well as generally to rationalize water allocation policies. <p> The most recent severe drought hit the region in 1998 in association with the 1997/1998 El Nino. The subsequent La Nina( 1999/2000) did not deliver above-normal levels of rainfall, and there are indications that 2002 will also deliver below-average rainfall. 42 The region is once more faced with increased vulnerability, from the economic and social perspective, to a possible dry season through early 2003. A drought during 2002/2003 has the potential to affect politics in the region and in the country, as state and presidential elections in Brazil will take place during the second half of 2002. Especially due to below-average rainfall in 2002, the present uncertainty regarding a possible El Nino( often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence the voting populace. Recollections of former states of emergency during periods of severe drought could easily be used( for better or worse) to shape the final outcome of the national elections, regardless of whether or not the El Nino occurs. <p> Clear and reliable communications that relate the state of the individual and the state of the environment remain critical for stable sociopolitical outcomes. A vital aspect of ensuring that climate information can be used to support decision-making remains trust. A clear understanding of the climate indicators used, their limitations, and degree of confidence, as well as their timelines, are crucial for trust building in the user 's community. <p>
