4003341 Mahmood Mamdani 's recent book, Citizen and Subject, examines the legacy of the bifurcated state in contemporary Africa. Under colonial rule, the full rights of citizenship were usually granted only to Europeans, while the vast majority of African inhabitants were recognized as subjects who therefore may have had " a modicum of civil rights, but not political rights. " 1 In French-administered colonies such as Gabon, this bifurcation was accomplished through the indigenat, the legal statutes that defined the civil status of the local African population in Gabon between 1910 and 1946. Even though a small number of elites were able to obtain French citizenship, most Gabonese were subject to this authoritarian and restrictive system. The rights of African sujets indigenes to freedom of speech, association, and movement were severely restricted. The subjects were obliged to provide unpaid and often forced labor to the colonial state for public projects ; French colonial administrators also had considerable leeway in administering punishments for infractions, often imposing sanctions in arbitrary fashion. In 1946 the system came to an end when the Lamine Gueye Law granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteen years a kind of African colonial citizenship evolved in Gabon in the context of an " ambiguous democracy. " 3 Growing numbers of Gabonese participated in an electoral culture that sent a Gabonese person to the French National Assembly and placed Gabonese representatives on various advisory, and ultimately governing, bodies. 4 Gabonese political elites were obliged to create a political system that catered to both a local electorate and to powerful French economic and political interests. Following independence in 1960, French presence and influence in Gabon actually increased as the country experienced an extraordinary economic boom due to revenues from petroleum and mineral exports. Gabon 's relationship with France has been rightly described as neocolonial, as evidenced in part by French nationals ' full citizenship rights in Gabon until the mid-1970s. <p> The electoral culture that had been the most important arena for the " continuing series of transactions between persons and agents " 5 of the Gabonese state had, by the mid-1960s, given way to new instruments of citizenship formation, most notably the extension of modern education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argues, however, that since independence it has been the participation of Gabonese urban populations -- particularly those of Libreville and Port-Gentil -- in mob violence against foreign African communities that has provided the central ingredient to the formation of Gabonese ideas of citizenship. This violence served, in effect, as a recurring ritual of civic expression that solidified a sense of Gabonese privilege and identity. Specifically, participation in this conflict both reinforced an evolving Gabonese national identity and a sense of entitlement whereby being Gabonese implied possession of a set of rights and privileges not obtainable by foreigners. Although the evolution of Gabonese national identity and citizenship are closely related, a focus on the maturation of the latter is essential to understanding the popular revolts against the government of Omar Bongo in the early 1990s. The rituals of street violence -- the most powerful instrument for expressing the claim to Gabonese identity and its accompanying rights -- were turned upon the state itself and upon the extraordinary privilege of Gabonese elites and French neocolonial interests. Now Gabonese citizenship no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but could demand a political response from the Gabonese state to meet its growing sense of entitlement. <p> The connections between Gabonese political elites and French culture are intimate and of considerable historical depth. 6 This special neocolonial relationship has prompted critical commentary from Anglophone Americans that often betrays a historical tension between U.S. and French interests in Gabon. 7 The historian K. David Patterson saw fit to close his study of the nineteenth-century Mpongwe and Orungu trading polities by citing a 1971 speech by President Bongo that claimed Gabon 's relationship with France had been distinguished by an " entente and harmony which has never known a discordant note " -- this, despite the legacy of the Atlantic slave trade and brutal concession company rule in the opening decades of the twentieth century. 8 In Patterson 's view, " These words are more than ceremonial rhetoric ; similar conceptions of the past are widespread among the Gabonese and are part of the national myth. " 9 The anthropologist Michael Reed categorically states that " Gabon 's very identity is inseparable from France, " 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " unjust " nature of neocolonial structures in Gabon as a step toward becoming " outraged at them. " 11 <p> An ironic aspect of the French legacy in Gabon is the link between recent political agitation there and the 1989 celebrations of the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. David Gardinier has suggested that this commemoration -- along with the breakup of the Eastern Bloc, a decline in the Gabonese economy, and a subsequent drop in living standards for the urban salaried classes -- led Gabonese to look critically at the excessive wealth and privilege that had accrued to their political elites during the country 's extraordinary economic boom from 1975 to 1985. 12 In this view, the revolutionary ideals of popular revolt helped to fuel the strikes and urban uprisings that rocked Gabon in the early 1990s. Gardinier further notes, " Focus on the rights of man and the citizen served to remind the Gabonese of the restraints on the exercise of such rights under the Bongo regime. " 13 The Context of Gabonese Citizenship <p> In focusing on Gabon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not intend to deny the role of other transactions between the state and its inhabitants in the formation of Gabonese citizenship. Florence Bernault, for example, clearly demonstrates that the period of " ambiguous democracy " and the electoral culture that developed in the wake of French colonial reforms following World War II laid the foundation for postindependence notions of citizenship. 14 In the 1970s and 1980s, Gabon 's petroleum-fueled economic boom allowed the state to intensify the kinds of transactions it had with its citizens. By the early 1980s, nearly all school-age children had obtained some primary-level education, which facilitated the spread of French as Gabon 's common language and introduced students to the images and rhetoric of the Parti Democratique Gabonais( PDG). Founded by Omar Bongo a year after he took power, the PDG was Gabon 's only political party from 1968 to 1990 and it completely dominated civil and nationalist discourse during this period. 15 <p> The economic boom accelerated an already well-established pattern of rural exodus as the inhabitants of Gabon 's sparsely populated forests flocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the petroleum industry) and Franceville( center for the mining industry). As a result, the great majority of Gabonese are now sufficiently urban based to assume their roles in the rituals of citizenship, since cities are the theaters where the state and the populace act out such rites. 16 Along with increased urbanization, the oil boom also produced greater revenues for the Gabonese government, enabling the state to become the single most important employer and, as one observer notes, " in the process recruiting virtually every adult Gabonese already in the modern sector to the State payroll or patronage trough! " 17 These developments contributed to the growing sense of a national identity, as well as a sense of the rights and privileges that should accompany Gabonese citizenship. <p> At independence in 1960 Gabonese citizenship as both identity and entitlement was significant only for a very small portion of the population. The 1970s oil boom, however, created the conditions under which effective mass citizenship became possible as the huge influx of foreign labor( recruited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perfect foil for construction of notions of mass citizenship. A shortage of labor has marked Gabon ever since its traumatic entry into the modern economic sector under French colonial rule. Beginning in 1842, when French marines established their garrison in the Estuary region with the aid of Senegalese sailors, small groups of West Africans have worked in Gabon as colonial auxiliaries or have been involved in commerce due to a chronic domestic labor shortage. When opportunities for significant investment and development presented themselves in the 1970s, it was readily apparent that Gabonese labor would not be sufficient to accomplish such ambitious infrastructure projects as the construction of the Transgabonais railroad or the radical transformation of Libreville from a sleepy colonial town to a modern urban center. Thus, the Gabonese state initiated a vigorous campaign of foreign labor recruitment that resulted in a non-Gabonese population of approximately 100,000( close to 20 percent of the country 's total population) by the mid-1980s. 18 <p> Despite the absolute necessity of a large immigrant work force, experts nonetheless recognized that a significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1978 study, the French geographer Claude Bouet emphasized that the recruitment of foreign workers must be strictly controlled and these workers should not exceed 10 percent of the total population. 19 Recalling past hostility of Gabonese people toward African foreign workers, Bouet suggested that urban-based Gabonese in particular, though " not being xenophobic, often adopt a reserved attitude towards the foreigner more enterprising than himself( an attitude, by the way, which is rarely manifested in encounters with European foreigners). " 20 <p> It is this attitude that the Bongo regime has effectively exploited to promote Gabonese national identity and citizenship. By strategically playing to what has become full-blown xenophobia, the Gabonese government has diverted popular frustration and anger during moments of political and economic crisis by targeting different immigrant communities. Charles Tilly has noted how " citizenship sometimes serves as a basis of collective action, including attacks on foreigners, demands for their expulsion, and calls for the denial of benefits to them. " 21 In Gabon, citizenship has been reinforced and more deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on various foreign populations beginning in 1962 and continuing into the 1990s. Although most of this activity has occurred in Libreville, the riots in Port-Gentil in May of 1990 seem to indicate a significant shift in attitude toward the " European foreigners " referred to above by Bouet. Libreville 's 1962 Congolese Riots <p> In 1904, the capital of the French Congo was moved from Libreville to Brazzaville, which also became the capital of the federation of French Equatorial Africa( Afrique Equatoriale Francaise or AEF) when it was created in 1910. Throughout the colonial period, Gabon, due to its timber industry, generated much of the revenue for the four-colony federation that consisted of Gabon, Moyen Congo, Oubangui-Chari, and Tchad. Considerable sums were invested in developing Brazzaville while Libreville languished in relative isolation ; this situation did not please Gabonese colonial elites or the Librevilleois, who had not forgotten their city 's once central position in the French colonial world. In the 1940s and 1950s, intense political activity linked to elections in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent mobs asserted their role on the Libreville political stage. 22 <p> An additional illustration of such tensions was a soccer match between the Gabonese and Congolese national teams for the Coupe des Tropiques in 1962, which incited mobs of newly independent Gabonese citizens to unleash attacks upon the immigrant Congolese in Libreville. 23 The match, which took place on 16 September in Brazzaville, ended in chaos as the Congolese crowd of nearly 30,000 attacked the referee and threatened the visiting Gabonese team. When the Gabonese players returned to Libreville and recounted their experiences, the news spread throughout the city and mobs roamed " the streets beating, maiming and killing Congolese. " 24 Two days of rioting( 18-19September) left nine dead( five Gabonese and four Congolese) and approximately thirty people wounded. Hundreds of homes in the Congolese-populated Akebe neighborhood were burned to the ground. On 20 September, 2,700 Congolese nationals were expelled from Gabon on a steamship to Pointe-Noire. Upon their arrival, reprisals began against the relatively small number of Gabonese residing in Pointe-Noire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The sudden influx of more than 2,000 Congolese into a depressed national economy suffering from urban unemployment placed considerable strain upon the Congolese government. Consequently, Congo 's President Youlou was obliged to institute special taxes to support " les refugies du Gabon. " 26 In a pattern that recurred later, the expelled Congolese represented the " enterprising " African foreigners( masons, carpenters, mechanics, plumbers, electricians, and so on) that Gabonese citizens treated with " reserve, " if not worse. 27 Such conflicts led to a diplomatic rift between the two countries. Although both President Fulbert Youlou of Congo and President Leon Mba of Gabon asked General De Gaulle to intervene to resolve their differences, the French president declined. 28 Diplomatic negotiations chaired by President Ahidjo of Cameroon in November 1962, however, then led to a reconciliation and the possibility for the expelled Congolese and Gabonese to return to their previous situations. 29 <p> The 1962 Congolese riots are significant in that they establish the pattern of " enterprising African foreigner " as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent acts. It is revealing that Mba reportedly explained these incidents as " the sequel to the AEF federation because Gabonese manpower and revenue sources had been sent to develop the Moyen Congo basin. " 30 At the time of Gabon 's independence, Mba had insisted upon the federation 's breakup so that Gabon alone would enjoy the benefits of its wealth. This notion of privileged access to the nation 's wealth thus became an essential element in the bundle of rights Gabonese people used to construct notions of citizenship. <p> Building upon real and perceived slights from their experience of the AEF federation, in 1962, urban Gabonese made Congolese immigrants the target of attacks. At least one observer suggests that Leon Mba 's government cynically allowed the situation to develop : <p> It was obvious to us that the forty-eight hours of rioting had been allowed by the government, which had made little effective attempt to interfere with the mobs, to call out the police or military, or to protect the lives and rights of the Congolese minority. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congolese, the Gabonese inhabitants of Libreville exercised both their emerging national identity and citizenship rights in the most powerful and dramatic fashion imaginable. <p> The Gabonese coup of February 1964 -- which briefly removed President Mba from power and resulted in direct French military intervention -- was not the consequence of a popular uprising but rather of the actions of a handful of Gabonese military officers. In the aftermath of Mba 's restoration( in which twenty-five Gabonese rebels and two French soldiers lost their lives), however, numerous incidents indicated the extent of popular discontent and frustration with the increasing heavy-handedness of the Mba regime. 32 Ironically, even though these demonstrations apparently did not contain strong anti-French sentiments, the Gabonese assistant secretary-general of the Francophone African and Malagasy Union, Germain Mba, resigned his position in protest following the French intervention, proclaiming : <p> Today, dozens of my compatriots have fallen, victims of French bullets, despite the fact that our revolution took place calmly. The restoration of Leon Mba and his incapable team by French paratroopers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has already been rejected by the entire Gabonese people. 33 <p> The coup and subsequent French intervention were watershed events in Gabon 's postcolonial history and demonstrated the extent to which the French would protect the interests of the Gabonese political class. When Albert-Bernard( later Omar) Bongo took power in 1967, he blamed the political malaise of the Mba government on the Gabonese multiparty system and the " tribalism " it engendered. He thus rationalized the creation of a single-party state dominated by his Parti Democratique Gabonais. 34 Bongo subsequently presided over Gabon 's economic boom and the arrival of tens of thousands of foreign workers into Libreville, Port-Gentil, and the smaller urban centers. By fanning the flames of xenophobia, he skillfully( and cynically) used these populations to not only deepen the idea of Gabonese citizenship but also to divert ethnic tensions that might otherwise have led to incidents of intra-Gabonese violence. <p> It is instructive to compare Gabon with the Congo in this regard because the latter has suffered enormously from interethnic violence. 35 Gabon 's large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent passions that develop in some modern urban contexts. It is here that state and citizen engage in the " connivance " or " intimacy of tyranny " described by Achille Mbembe, where " the masses join in the madness and clothe themselves in cheap imitations of power. " 36 Gabon 's advantage is that the targets for such violence are not " citizens " but inherently vulnerable " immigrants. " Moreover, Bongo has purposefully provoked antiforeign sentiment that has led to deadly actions. The Congo, on the other hand, has had no such " luxury. " The violence that has so profoundly marked its postindependence history has been organized around shifting conceptions of ethnicity among its own citizens, a much more complex and destructive affair. The 1978 Beninois Expulsion <p> The 1970s witnessed a massive influx of foreign immigrants to meet the growing labor needs of Gabon 's booming economy. Not all the immigrants came for economic reasons, however ; the largest foreign community in Gabon consists of some 60,000 political refugees who fled( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1968-1979) in neighboring Equatorial Guinea. Some established themselves as independent farmers or agribusiness farmworkers in Gabon 's Woleu-N'Tem province. Most Equatorial Guineans, however, came to Libreville where their presence strained local services and added to growing xenophobia. Les Equatos came to be associated with manual labor and have been subject to attacks from Gabonese citizens, most notably during police sweeps in February 1978. Their situation differs somewhat from other foreign populations because many of the Equatorial Guinean refugees are from Gabon 's most important ethnic group, the Fang, and thus have family and kin relations with Gabonese citizens. 37 <p> The combination of an economic boom, inflation in Libreville, and the control of food distribution in the capital by foreign commercial retailers led to a tense situation by the mid-1970s. 38 High food prices led to attacks upon foreign commercants based in Libreville in January 1975, killing one person and injuring approximately twenty others. When the government responded with price controls, hoarding and food shortages spread throughout towns. In addition, Gabonese farmers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the military was enlisted to create Gabonese commercial networks to demonstrate that " the Gabonese people know how to farm and how to do business -- they are not lazy. " 39 These tensions reached a crisis when a festering political feud between President Bongo and Benin 's President Mathieu Kerekou coincided with a decline in Gabonese economic fortunes in 1978. <p> In preparation for the 1977 Organization of African Unity( OAU) summit( Bongo being the OAU president from 1977-1978), an estimated $600 million -- equivalent to three-fifths of the 1977 national budget -- was spent to turn Libreville into a modern urban showcase, and another $300 million was expended for the construction of Bongo 's presidential palace. The timing was poor, however, because the economy took a nosedive in 1978 and the government was obliged to implement austerity measures. Meanwhile, a political feud that began in January 1977 when a small group of mercenaries attempted to invade Benin to topple the Kerekou regime ultimately led to an explosion of violence in Libreville in July 1978. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials had played a key role in the attack upon his country, Bongo accused him of trying to sabotage Gabon 's hosting of the July OAU summit. 40 Kerekou countered that any African leader who attended the Libreville meeting was, in his eyes, a " traitor " ; Gabon subsequently banned Benin nationals from entering its territory. 41 <p> The feud continued over the next year, culminating at the July 1978 OAU summit in Khartoum where Kerekou reiterated his allegations in Bongo 's presence. The Gabonese president was furious, viewing the accusations as both a personal insult and as an affront to the integrity of the Gabonese state. Thus, the person of Bongo and the image of the state were now merged in the minds of many Gabonese citizens. Kerekou 's allegations were sufficient fuel to ignite violent attacks against Beninois residing in Gabon. In a telegram to the OAU chairman, Bongo stated that " the anger of an entire people, which has been controlled for a whole year, literally exploded after the verbal vulgarities and insanities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place on 21-22 July, resulting in the destruction of Libreville 's main market, Mount Bouet, whose commerce had been under the control of Beninois merchants. On 23 July it was decided that the 10,000 Benin nationals residing in Gabon were to be expelled, a decision that had consequences not only for food distribution but for other sectors of the economy and society as well( especially education). A significant percentage of Gabonese secondary school teachers were from Benin, for example, and their departure led to delays in opening the 1978-1979 academic year. In addition, the government of Upper Volta( present Burkina Faso) opted to repatriate its nationals in the face of growing hostility toward foreigners. 43 Though there was an economic price to pay for these actions, the Gabonese state was able to avert more serious political unrest through an exercise in " citizenship promotion. " It was noted at the time that <p> Bongo denied charges that his decision had been motivated by the economic crisis in Gabon. However, unemployment had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of xenophobia is a familiar tactic in Gabon as elsewhere. 44 <p> A continuous loop has been established whereby the perceived economic entitlement of Gabonese citizens is threatened by economic downturn and the commercial activities of foreign Africans, which in turn creates political tensions. The state seeks to alleviate these tensions by allowing xenophobic violence that, through mass participation, reinforces the sense of entitlement until a new set of circumstances places these rights under threat. Ironically, although the expulsion of Benin nationals in 1978 ultimately strengthened Gabonese nationalist identity and citizenship, in the short run it resulted in more difficult material conditions for the average Gabonese person. " La Guerre du Football " : The 1981 Flight of Cameroonians <p> By the early 1980s, the economic outlook had improved due to a rise in oil prices and the discovery of new reserves, alleviating a panic that oil revenues were soon to disappear. But the elements of violence still remained : immigrant communities energetically working the Gabonese milch cow and tense Gabonese citizens feeling that some of their own rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in Gabon from 1982 to 1984, I often heard Gabonese proudly refer to their country as being wealthy, reflecting their president 's comments that Gabon was like a beautiful young woman with many suitors. Some assumed that simply by being a citizen of Gabon one was entitled to a comfortable government office job at decent pay, and for a time the Gabonese state could almost guarantee this. But when economic reality set in and this basis for citizenship was undermined, political crisis and attacks on foreigners were never far behind. <p> The economy in 1981 was in a much better condition than three years previously, but concerns about inflationary prices for basic necessities still haunted the inhabitants of Libreville and Port-Gentil. Further, anonymous political tracts criticizing President Bongo and his family were circulated in Libreville in March. These were early signals of opposition political activity organized by the Mouvement de Redressement National( MORENA) that boldly burst upon the scene in November and December. This activity was encouraged by the election in May of Francois Mitterand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bongo regime. Partly in response to the distribution of these tracts, a new Public Security Ministry was created in April. Life in Libreville continued in a state of tension. 45 <p> Once again a football match led to violence. This time Cameroonians were the target, a community whose networks were said to supply almost 75 percent of Gabon 's food needs in 1981. 46 A soccer match between teams from Douala and Libreville held in Douala on 20 May was marred by fighting among the players. On 22 May the Gabonese daily, L'Union, published photos showing Gabonese players laid out on the turf, apparently injured. 47 The next day, Libreville mobs started to attack <p> the symbols of Cameroonian activity : markets, small bars and stores. At the central Mont-Bouet market, stalls went up in flames, the largest stores were looted. According to eyewitnesses, police were seen attacking and even looting. Students as well let loose and took part. In many quartiers, cars were in flames, especially " Cameroonian " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were killed in this rioting and that a number of Cameroonians were injured. The Cameroon government quickly made arrangements for the evacuation of its population as the violence spread to Port-Gentil and other urban centers. Within a few days, 6,000 Cameroonian nationals were airlifted out of Gabon, with the total ultimately reaching 10,000. In turn, Gabon recalled 100 or so of its nationals studying at the Cameroonian National University in Yaounde. 49 In the midst of all this, Senegal 's President Abdou Diouf was in Libreville on a state visit. Ironically, when Diouf met with Bongo, the latter expressed his satisfaction with the comportment of the 5,000-strong Senegalese community in Gabon, stating that " African peoples must stand together. " 50 The State Steps In : Bongo 's 1985 Attacks on the Lebanese Community <p> At the end of 1984, President Bongo initiated his most blatant attempt to manipulate the xenophobic tendencies of Gabonese citizens. In an address to the PDG 's Political Bureau, he cited immigration as a problem that had to be brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the Gabonese gendarmerie at the end of January 1985( which was subsequently published in L'Union), Bongo let loose a burst of antiforeign invective. 51 He first targeted prostitutes, claiming that all the women plying this trade in Libreville were foreigners. He authorized the gendarmerie to send out trucks to round up these women and then rather crudely suggested, " Then we will leave them to the army. Once five or six soldiers have been on top of them, perhaps they will understand that we do n't tolerate streetwalking in Gabon. " 52 <p> Next he moved to attack immigrants who " enter Gabon and leave as they wish, " spreading " disharmony among Gabonese " and " murdering the national economy. " 53 It was perhaps no coincidence that 1985 marked the beginning of a serious decline in the Gabonese economy from which it has yet to fully recover. This time, the Lebanese community was singled out for cheating the Gabonese population by not paying customs duties. When similar accusations had been made against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lebanese nationals. 54 The consequences were more serious this time, however. Immediately after the speech, Libreville mobs began pillaging Lebanese stores, and Bongo was obliged to issue a communique calling for calm. 55 <p> The Lebanese community in Gabon( with an estimated population of only 600), was not Bongo 's real worry. Rather, he feared the development of a large foreign underclass of beggars and unemployed as immigrant workers opted to stay in Gabon despite its economic decline because prospects in their home countries were even more dismal. Beginning in 1985, Gabonese authorities began to control more rigorously the immigrant population, conducting systematic identity checks and arresting those whose papers were not in order. In May the borders were closed to facilitate a census of all foreigners. Simultaneously it was announced that new bureaucratic measures would be instituted in 1986 to establish residence status and to distribute work permits. In addition, the government launched a campaign of " Gabonization " of both public and private employment. 56 <p> As planned, new residence cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of research at a cost of several million dollars produced a card that was supposed to be impossible to forge. The card could be obtained for CFA 50,000( 50,000 African Financial Community francs, about U.S.$200) after receiving a work permit from the Ministry of Labor. Immigrants were also obliged to pay a repatriation fee equivalent to the price of a return ticket to their home countries, and an additional charge of 20 percent was tacked on for administrative costs. If immigrant workers desired to visit their home countries and then return to Gabon, they would have to pay another CFA 250,000( about U.S.$1,000). 57 These bureaucratic measures indicated a shift in strategy of the Gabonese state -- namely, attempts to control the immigrant population were becoming more institutionalized. From 1986 to the present, bureaucratic instruments of the state, rather than volatile and destructive mobs, would play a more central role in strengthening Gabonese citizenship. <p> Although the more than 100,000 African immigrants in Gabon were alarmed by the exorbitant costs of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought under control. In a speech to the PDG Central Committee shortly after announcing these measures, he stated : " We can not go on entrusting our destiny to foreigners, however honest they may be. " 58 Bongo reiterated that the immigration situation was out of control and once again called for a census and registration of the foreign community, threatening illegal immigrants with deportation. In addition, he accused European residents in Gabon of having racist attitudes and the Lebanese community of engaging in corruption. Furthermore, Bongo blamed the African immigrant community for an increase in crime and the spread of various kinds of sorcery. The immigrant registration program advanced in fits and starts. In June 1988 a thorough street-level search to check for new residence cards and work permits resulted in the deportation of 2,500 illegal aliens. 59 Nonetheless, these actions failed to have any impact on growing unemployment among Gabonese, which was becoming a serious political liability for the Bongo regime as it entered the 1990s. Into the 1990s : Citizens Challenge the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures to control government led to unprecedented political instability as the new decade began. The year 1989 had witnessed the return of exiled MORENA opposition figure Father Paul Mba-Abessole, as well as the uncovering of two plots by well-placed government officials who sought to overthrow the Bongo regime. In 1990, the Libreville crowd turned the tables on the government and exercised its citizenship rights by attacking the symbols of excess associated with Gabonese political elites. The foreign community did not escape unscathed, as Lebanese enterprises continued to be targeted during the unrest. But it was clear that this violent mob was acting in a very different manner and in very different circumstances than in previous years. 60 <p> The wave of demonstrations and strikes began on 16 January 1990 as students at Omar Bongo University in Libreville protested the deteriorating state of the campus and its facilities. The following day police moved in to evict the students and occupy the campus. On 18 January secondary school students struck in solidarity, and then the general public also joined their protests. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 Lebanese businesses were damaged and several store owners were injured. As the spirit of rebellion spread, strikes in both the public and private sectors brought all activity in Libreville to a virtual standstill. The crisis peaked in the final days of February when airport personnel, telecommunication workers, and gas station attendants added their numbers to striking teachers and physicians, each sector demanding higher salaries and better working conditions. The diverse array of public and private sector workers engaging in labor strikes indicated that the Gabonese sense of entitlement -- the foundation of Gabonese citizenship -- was faced with a serious threat. As economic privilege declined for average citizens, their lack of political rights was highlighted, making the unrest particularly acute( not to mention that these developments occurred just months after the French Revolution 's bicentennial celebration). The ritual of mob violence now directed its rage toward the Gabonese state, and the government was forced to react. <p> The unrest pushed Bongo to dissolve the ruling PDG and organize a national conference in March 1990 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 61 Bongo however, was able to ride out this rough patch and successfully manipulate his victory in the 1993 presidential elections. As the 1990s draw to a close and he enters his fifth decade as head of state, Omar Bongo continues to master the system in a new age of " ambiguous democracy. " 62 <p> Although Gabonese citizens are no longer quite as apt to define themselves in opposition to the foreign community, the large number of immigrants continues to be seen as a serious cause of instability. Since 1986, the Gabonese state has focused on closing the petite porte to those foreign workers at the lower end of the economic scale. In the succeeding decade, Gabonese security forces have ordered several expulsions of illegal immigrants( mostly Nigerian nationals), and there have been reports of human rights violations against foreign workers. 63 This is an intractable problem because the once-expelled illegal immigrants often return to Gabon from Nigeria via dangerous ocean routes in open boats. Indeed, the potential for tragedy has been great. In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationals accused of being illegal immigrants -- suffocated to death in an overcrowded cell in a Libreville detention center. 64 <p> A new plan was announced in September 1994 whereby illegal immigrants in Gabon would have until 31 January 1995 to obtain proper residence papers or be expelled. By the end of 1994, thousands of immigrant workers, fearing violence after the deadline, gathered without incident in Libreville and at Gabon 's border posts with Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon to return home. As 31 January approached the Gabonese government extended the deadline to 15 February, and, as the latter deadline passed, papers for a number of cases were still being processed. Nonetheless, as of early March, an estimated 64,000 foreigners had left Gabon in relative calm. The bureaucratic instruments of the state had in effect replaced the Libreville mob. 65 <p> In the ironic pattern that followed previous expulsions, everyday life in Libreville became more difficult. 66 A report from mid-February stated : <p> Taxis are rare and this hurts businesses whose employees now arrive late to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fisherman were exclusively Nigerians or West Africans. In the popular quartiers, a number of shops, the majority run by Malians, have closed up. 67 <p> One journalist predicted serious economic and social repercussions in Gabon, noting that <p> according to popular imagery, the Gabonese is seated on a throne ; he has a Ghanaian to shine his shoes, a Beninois to drive him around in a taxi, a Cameroonian to sell him things to eat, and an " Equato "( Equatorial Guinean) to take care of his household.... 68 <p> There was a sense that these days had come to an end, and the Gabonese government attempted to make this clear in a series of pronouncements once again stressing " Gabonization " and encouraging Gabonese citizens to work hard and enter jobs they had previously snubbed. <p> A shift does seem to have occurred ; long-term economic hardship has severely damaged the sense of economic entitlement that had been so important to Gabonese citizenship from the 1960s through the 1980s. Prime Minister Paulin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one where " we have been too used to the good life. It is time that we take action ; the Providential state is finished. " Then, reflecting upon transportation in Libreville, he asked, " The whole taxi transport network is in the hands of foreigners. Do you find that normal? " He concluded by noting that France won the Battle of the Marne in 1914 " with Parisian taxis, because the taxi drivers were French. " 69 <p> Nguema 's final remark is revealing and speaks volumes about the nature of the French influence in Gabon and about Gabonese ideals of citizenship. Yet the nature of French influence in 1995 was not the same as that in 1964. In the middle of the government campaign against illegal immigrants, a mysterious group known as the " Committee of the Libreville Unemployed " distributed tracts throughout the city threatening that if the order for expulsion was not applied by the indicated date, " every foreigner living in the popular quartiers and whose papers were not in order will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Libreville will be taken hostage and progressively killed. " 70 By 1995, the Gabonese sense of citizenship had become strong enough to issue threats against what had always been the most important foreign community in their midst -- the French. <p> Under Bongo 's repressive rule in the 1970s and 1980s, niches existed where Gabonese people were able to construct a sense of citizenship -- usually at the expense of the foreign community -- and ultimately to challenge seriously the president 's survival in the early 1990s. The state 's connivance with the Libreville crowd or general mob backfired, first in 1990 and then again following the flawed presidential elections in 1993 as the mobs turned their violence on the state itself. 71 They also directly attacked the French presence for the first time. <p> The most dramatic developments of 1990 occurred in Port-Gentil at the end of May following the mysterious death of opposition leader Joseph Rendjambe. Amid the rioting, several French businesspeople and diplomats were held hostage, and French troops were obliged to intervene and evacuate French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect its citizens, it also effectively kept Bongo in power, though demonstrating that he had lost control of the situation. 72 Paris subsequently undertook to mediate differences between Bongo and elements of the political opposition. The neocolonial relationship remains, as was made clear during the 1993 presidential elections when French " electoral experts " from their Ministry of the Interior helped to falsify the results in Bongo 's favor. 73 At first glance, it would appear that " plus ca change... " ; but this would be denying the real evolution of Gabonese citizenship and its influence in bringing about the reforms -- albeit incomplete -- of the 1990s. It would also deny Gabonese citizens ' new-found ability to question France 's dominant position in the politics of their country. <p> As often happens, events may be running ahead of the special Franco-Gabonese relationship. By August of 1997, it appeared that the realignment of France 's relationship with its former African colonies( as proposed in the early days of Mitterand 's presidency) might now actually occur under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democratic Republic of the Congo( the former Zaire), as well as rebellions in the Central African Republic and Congo-Brazzaville, have undermined the diverse networks through which French policy in Africa often operated in cloak and dagger fashion. Omar Bongo remains one of the last figures of the old order and has in effect become the senior spokesman for " Parisnoia, " as evidenced by comments he made at the end of June 1997 : <p> I think there exists a plot at the moment against Francophone Africa. How else can you explain that the slightest spark in this part of the continent is immediately fanned?... Francophone countries of Africa have understood the meaning of democracy but that is far from the case for their English-speaking counterparts, where multiparty systems do n't exist. Is n't it strange that no voice denounces that state of affairs? 74 Conclusion <p> Bongo 's claim that only Francophone African regimes " have understood the meaning of democracy " implies that it is these regimes ' privileged access to the legacy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed democracies and citizens than other African countries. His point is made in reference to democratic reforms undertaken in the wake of Mitterand 's pronouncements about aid and democracy at the 1990 Franco-African summit in La Baule. Yet in the Gabonese context these reforms were a consequence of Gabonese citizens exercising their power by taking to the streets to attack the privileges of Gabonese and French elites. This citizenship was largely forged through a series of informal transactions -- indeed, connivances -- between the state and its citizens that targeted different foreign populations for xenophobic attack between 1962 and 1990. The experience of mob violence not only served to crystallize Gabonese citizenship around a sense of economic entitlement, but also established a pattern of citizenship politics that would target the state in the 1990s. Perhaps most significant, however, Gabonese citizens( though not the Gabonese political class) have gained sufficient strength to stridently confront the fundamental issue of their country 's neocolonial relationship to France. <p>
