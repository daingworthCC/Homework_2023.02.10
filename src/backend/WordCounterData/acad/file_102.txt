4014941 Section : Science and practice <p> Hepatitis B virus( HBV) infection is a global challenge, there being an estimated 300 million chronic carriers worldwide.( n1) <p> Physicians faced with a clinical suspicion of hepatitis B and those wishing to exclude HBV infection in blood donors or to determine susceptibility to such infection or to monitor responses to vaccination send samples of blood to the laboratory. Table l lists some of the tests likely to be done there and the viral elements that these assays exploit. The serological tests will be familiar, those based on molecular biology less so, but neither the clinical significance of the commercial assays for HBV serology nor more recent developments such as the branched-chain DNA assay for HBV DNA can be understood without delving deeply into the structure and organisation of the HBV genome. And the same applies to our comprehension of hepatitis B vaccines, the pathogenesis of HBV infection, the mechanism of HBV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis, and current and future approaches to treatment. Structure of HBV genome <p> HBV, a hepadnavirus, is the smallest DNA virus known, having only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is partly double-stranded circular DNA. One strand known as " minus " is almost a complete circle and contains overlapping genes that encode both structural proteins( pre-S, surface, core) and replicative proteins( polymerase, X)( figure. 1). The other strand( " plus ") is short and variable in length. <p> Two enhancer elements have been identified. ENH I is tissue specific and functions efficiently only in hepatocytes. Binding proteins and liver-specific factors bind to it, and ENH I also has a retinoic-acid-responsive element, suggesting a role for retinoic acid in the liver-specific regulation of HBV gene expression. ENH II stimulates the transcriptional activity of the surface gene promoters. Other elements are summarised in the legend to figure 1. The most conserved area is a 62 nucleotide domain in the pre-core/core region which shares considerable homology with a domain( U5) in certain retroviruses, suggesting a common evolutionary origin.( n3) Transcription and translation( table 2) <p> Four mRNA transcripts of known function have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ template both for genome replication and for the expression of pre-core/core and polymerase proteins. A 2.4 kb transcript encodes for pre-S1, pre-S2, and HBsAg while a 2.1 kb transcript encodes only for pre-S2 and HBsAg. The smallest transcript( 0.7 kb) encodes the X protein. <p> The core gene, which has a pre-core region, encodes for both core antigen( HBcAg) and a cleavage product, e antigen( HBeAg). When pre-core is transcribed, HBcAg is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum where it is cleaved and HBeAg is secreted.( n4, n5) HBcAg is important for viral packaging and is an integral part of the core particle of the whole virus. Even though the pre-core sequence is not essential for replication, HBeAg is a good marker of active HBV replication because the pre-core/core gene product is generated from the template that is also used for replication. <p> The surface/pre-S gene encodes for the virus envelope. Pre-S seems to be important for the attachment of HBV to hepatocytes. In vitro, one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pre-S2.( n6) The S1 site and one pre-S2 site can bind directly to a hepatoblastoma cell line. Pre-S1 also binds to liver plasma membrane yet it is not liver specific, for it also binds to mononuclear cells. HBV has been detected in mononuclear cells but it is not actively replicating, indicating another post-infection tissue-specific mechanism, such as ENH I. The other pre-S2 site also binds to albumin, suggesting an alternative way of viral entry. <p> In transgenic mice and in cell culture models, intracellular accumulation of pre-S1 inhibits secretion of HBsAg( n7, n8) but the role of the pre-S1/HBsAg ratio in the export of HBsAg in man remains to be established. Viral replication <p> Our understanding of hepadnavirus replication is largely derived from animal models. There are three characteristics. First, the DNA strands are synthesised ; the minus strand must be completed before synthesis of the other strand can proceed. Second, the virus polymerase also functions as a reverse transcriptase. Finally, minus strand is primed by terminal protein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plus is by an oligoribonucleotide derived from viral genomic RNA. <p> HBV binds to the cell surface and penetrates the cell( figure 2). The virus core is thought to be transported to the nucleus without processing. The relaxed circular virus DNA is then converted to a covalently closed circular DNA( cccDNA) which seems to function as the template for viral RNA synthesis. Integration of HBV DNA into the host genome does not occur during the normal course of replication, as it does with retroviruses. Transcription yields RNA of various sizes. The 3 5 kb genomic RNA serves as a template for reverse transcription. Minus strand DNA synthesis initiates at the 3 ' DRI with the terminal protein of the polymerase as a primer and, as synthesis progresses, the RNA template is simultaneously degraded by RNaseH( figure 3). Plus strand DNA synthesis initiates at the 3 ' end of DR2 and synthesis continues until the terminal protein at the 5 ' end of the minus strand is passed( figure 3). @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mature HBV. Since most HBV particles contain open DNA circles with incomplete plus strands it has been postulated that the virus polymerase is somehow constrained at this point. The mature core particles are then packed into the HBsAg/pre-S in the endoplasmic reticulum and exported from the cell. A stable pool of cccDNA molecules is maintained in the nuclei by transporting the newly synthesised HBV DNA back into the nucleus. Because HBsAg can inhibit the formation of cccDNA, this may represent a negative feedback to HBV replication.( n10) <p> Clinical relevance <p> The variable region between the core and surface gene has been used to study transmission of HBV. For example, DNA fingerprinting can reveal the route of transmission of the virus in families even in HBV endemic areas.( n11) <p> 3% or so of babies born to HBsAg positive mothers and receiving both active and passive immunoprophylaxis at birth, will still become seropositive for HBsAg. Among the subtypes of HBV, the " a " determinant of HBsAg remains constant and the vaccine promotes antibodies against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccination have an " escape mutant " of HBV lacking " a ".( n12) In this mutant just one aminoacid( an arginine) is replaced by another( glycine). This important finding confirms the need for seroepidemiological follow-up of vaccinees and for new vaccines with other protective epitopes such as pre-S1, which has a role in viral binding to hepatocytes. <p> The commonest HBV mutation is in the pre-core region where a genomic instruction to stop translation of an mRNA to protein prevents production of HBeAg.( n13, n14) These patients have HBV DNA in their serum but have antibody to e, and most of them have active liver disease. This mutant has also been associated with fulminant hepatitis B.( n15-n17) However, the hepatitis in babies who acquire this pre-core mutant from their mothers resolves promptly, so this mutant is not always associated with severe disease. Because the pre-core mutant takes many years to emerge from the " wild type " HBV, both wild type and pre-core mutant may well be transmitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably selected by the host 's immune response and exogenous factors, including interferon-a( IFN Alpha) therapy. <p> Variations of the mid-core region of the HBV genome have been reported to be associated with the development of active liver disease in chronic HBV infection in Japan,( n18) but we have not seen this in US whites. <p> Tumour necrosis factor-Alpha( TNF Alpha) and IFN Alpha and Gamma inhibit the HBV core/genomic and pre-S 1 promoters in cell culture, but in patients with chronic HBV infection TNF Alpha had either no effect or increased the amount of circulating HBV and HBsAg.( n19) IFN Gamma has little inhibitory effect on circulating HBV.( n20) <p> The information on viral replication is important for drug design. So far, however, agents which inhibit DNA synthesis and reduce HBV replication, once they are withdrawn, are followed by HBV recurrence. The cccDNA molecules in the nuclei of hepatocytes seem to be very stable. Non-hepatic sites of virus replication, such as peripheral blood lymphocytes and spleen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of viral persistence <p> Viral persistence is probably related to a specific failure of T cells to recognise HBV antigens. This assumption is supported by the clinical observation that patients with a relative deficit in T-cell function( the young, the aged, and the immunosuppressed) are more prone to develop chronic HBV infection. In-vitro peripheral blood T cell activation is impaired in patients with chronic HBV infection but this is not associated with clinical evidence of immune deficiency, suggesting a redistribution of primed T cells from the circulation to the liver. <p> The demonstration that IFN Alpha can eliminate active HBV replication raises the possibility that chronic HBV carriage may be secondary to IFN Alpha deficiency. IFN Alpha is rarely detected in the circulation in chronic hepatitis B and virus-stimulated production of IFN Alpha by circulating mononuclear cells is reduced.( n21) Furthermore, the HBV core gene suppresses the IFN Beta gene in mouse fibroblasts.( n22) Although these findings are attractive, HBV appears not to alter IFN Alpha production significantly in man. First, IFN Alpha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mononuclear cells and liver levels of this enzyme are higher in patients with acute HBV infection and in HBV carriers than they are in healthy controls, and patients with HBV-related chronic active hepatitis have normal levels.( n23) Second, both IFN Alpha protein and mRNA detected in the liver. Although the hepatic expression of IFN Alpha is lower than that of acute HBV, those with active liver disease had higher hepatic expression of IFN Alpha, suggesting that suboptimal production of IFN Alpha by circulating mononuclear cells may be related to a redistribution of the " primed " cells to the liver. Alternatively, the production of IFN Alpha by circulating cells may have been down-regulated during its passage through the liver.( n24) <p> HBV can also reduce the cell 's sensitivity to IFN Alpha. When a vector containing HBV was transfected into an IFN Alpha-sensitive cell line, the response to exogenous IFN Alpha was reduced.( n25) Subsequently it was found that the terminal protein of the HBV polymerase inhibited the response to IFN( and to double-stranded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential importance in relation to the mechanism of viral persistence. <p> The high incidence of chronic HBV carriage in babies born to HBeAg + mothers suggests that circulating e antigen in the mother induces immunotolerance in the baby. In newborn transgenic mice that produce HBeAg, both HBeAg and HBcAg are tolerant at the T-cell level.( n27) These mice produce core but not e antibody. The maintenance of T-cell tolerance was broken only when HBeAg had been withdrawn for more than 16 weeks. The close resemblance in the chronology of immunological events in HBeAg-expressing transgenic mice and in human HBV infection suggests that one function of e antigen may be to induce immunotolerance in utero, favouring the persistence of HBV in infancy and childhood. Mechanism of hepatocellular damage <p> The existence of an HBV carrier state for many years without evidence of parenchymal liver damage suggests that HBV is not cytopathic in man and that an immune-mediated mechanism is operating. This assumption is supported by the absence of obvious disease in patients with impaired immune response( Down 's syndrome, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that the predominant cell-type at the site of piecemeal necrosis is the CD8 + T lymphocyte ; and by the enhanced liver cell necrosis found when the immune system is stimulated by levamisole or by corticosteroid withdrawal. <p> What is the specific target for immune attack? It is not easy to study the mechanism of hepatocellular injury in acute HBV infection. In one attempt 5 individuals in the early **25;1584;TOOLONG phase of acute HBV infection were identified by contact tracing and their cellular immune response to HBV antigens was monitored.( n28) Cellular immunity to pre-S developed 30 days before biochemical evidence of liver damage appeared, at a stage when the HBsAg titre was rising and when HBeAg was first detectable. A cellular response to HBcAg followed 10 days later, preceding the humoral response( anti-HBc IgM). The cellular response to HBsAg correlated most closely with the onset of biochemical liver damage, suggesting HBsAg as the likely immune target. On the other hand, cytotoxic T lymphocytes( CTL) directed against HBcAg have been identified, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Studies with overlapping synthetic peptides have delineated some of the HLA restricted T-cell epitopes( eg, an HLA-A2 restricted epitope has been mapped to aminoacid residue 18-27 of HBcAg( n29)) and, recently, aminoacid residues 141-151 to both HLA-A31 and HLA-Aw 68. <p> The search for the immune target in chronic HBV infection is just as difficult but hepatocytes expressing HBcAg have come under suspicion. In cytotoxicity experiments T cells lysed hepatocytes that expressed HBcAg, and this cytotoxicity could be blocked by antibody to HBcAg or by HLA class I molecules.( n30, n31) There is some evidence that anti-HBe can also block cytotoxicity. No response to HBsAg was demonstrated. Immunohistochemical studies showed that cytoplasmic expression of core, but not surface, correlates with disease activity.( n32, n33) As T cell epitopes are usually 8-10 aminoacids in length, cytoplasmic accumulation of HBcAg may allow proteolytic processing to produce T-cell epitopes that are presented in conjunction with HLA class I molecules. <p> Study of T-helper cells( T h) has identified three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one of these partly overlaps the HLA-A2 restricted CTL epitope referred to above. These studies indicate that HBcAg can be a stimulus for both helper and cytotoxic T cells. <p> Non-T- lymphocytes also seem to take part in the mediation of hepatocellular damage in chronic infection. Non-T-cell cytotoxicity can be blocked by liver-specific membrane lipoprotein( LSP), aggregated IgG, or the F( ab ') 2 fragment of anti-human IgG, suggesting that non-T lymphocytes may direct an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity against a component of LSP.( n35) <p> Cytokines are also likely to be involved.( n36) In patients with HBV-related active liver disease, IFN Alpha is produced locally in the liver, and production of interleukin-1 and TNF Alpha by peripheral blood mononuclear cells are also increased. The possibility that these are non-specific consequences of inflammation remains to be excluded. <p> Although the evidence strongly suggests that HBV causes hepatocellular damage through an immune-mediated mechanism, this may not be true in other models or clinical settings. High-level expression of HBsAg is associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) and overexpression of HBcAg in hepatoblastoma line induces cytopathic changes.( n38) In patients transplanted for chronic hepatitis B, recurrence of infection is associated with a novel histological pattern( fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis) and fulminant clinical course. HBV may be directly cytopathic in this situation.( n39) <p> Clinical relevance <p> Theoretically, immunosuppressive therapy should alleviate hepatocellular damage induced by immune-mediated mechanisms. However, corticosteroids also have a direct stimulatory effect on viral replication and this may be associated with an increased antigen expression and greater spread through the liver. Upon corticosteroid withdrawal, the immune rebound, coupled with the enhanced viral antigen( immune target) expression, may result in severe, even fulminant reactivation.( n40, n41) Rapid reintroduction of corticosteroids followed by gradual withdrawal may alleviate the severe life-threatening reactivation.( n42) <p> The identification of the T-cell epitope for CTL in patients with HLA-A2.1 has led to the design of a " therapeutic vaccine " to stimulate the immune system to eliminate HBV-infected cells selectively. One approach, now close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Tsub h) peptide from tetanus toxoid and two palmitic acid molecules. A potential risk is an overwhelming immune response, which could lead to massive destruction of infected hepatocytes. Viral Interactions <p> Hepatitis D virus( HDV), a defective virus that requires HBV to supply the envelope proteins, only infects man in the presence of HBV, either as a coinfection or as a superinfection in HBV carriers. With coinfection, the clinical course is usually self-limiting because the HDV can not outlive the transient HBV infection, but with a superinfection, the attack can be very severe. In patients with chronic HBV and HDV coinfection the HDV suppresses HBV replication without significant effect on the expression of HBsAg.( n43) This HBV-inhibitory mechanism of HDV, if identified, could provide a new treatment strategy for chronic HBV infection. <p> HBV and HIV coinfection is common because the risk factors for the two viruses are similar. The liver disease in such coinfections is usually mild, despite active HBV replication, and this may be related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to impairment of T h cells( CD4+) and monocytes, the main targets of HIV. HIV infection is also associated with a suboptimal production of IFN Alpha which may allow HBV persistence and reduce the immune-mediated attack on HBV-infected hepatocytes.( n44) On the reverse side of the coin, HBV may enhance HIV replication. Production of IFN Alpha in the circulation is suboptimal in chronic HBV infection and this may permit HIV replication ; the HBVX protein can trans-activate HIV replication ; and the increased production of TNF Alpha in chronic HBV infection can stimulate the HIV enhancer and hence replication. Hepatocarcinogenesis <p> The strong association of persistent HBV infection and hepatocellular carcinoma( HCC) is intriguing, yet poorly understood. Although the relative risk of HCC developing in HBV carriers is as high as 100 times that in matched controls, it usually takes decades for HCC to emerge. Since HBV integration can occur early, this suggests that HBV does not have an oncogene in its genome. Integration of HBV adjacent to cellular oncogenes, followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gene has come under suspicion because of its trans-activating activity. Various cellular oncogenes, such as c-myc and c-ras, have been implicated but none has been shown to be consistently activated in HCC. The strong association of cirrhosis with HCC suggests that the common pathway for hepatocarcinogenesis may be chronic hepatic injury and regeneration, which in some way promote the induction or selection of a malignant clone. <p> HCC may well be a heterogeneous disease with cellular oncogene and common pathway models both operating to varying extents. Further understanding of this heterogeneity may help in the establishment of the mechanisms involved in HCC -- as happened with our understanding of the pathobiology of lymphoma and leukaemia in the wake of the identification of subtypes by phenotypic markers. Other potential developments <p> The hepatotropism of HBV has led research workers to consider using the virus as an organ-targeting vector for gene delivery. However, the HBV genome is so small and compact that the molecular engineering is difficult. Table 1.
