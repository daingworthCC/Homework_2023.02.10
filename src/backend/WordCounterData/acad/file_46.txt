4007941 Following the collapse of communism, the relative stability of the **29;288;TOOLONG confrontation has been replaced by power politics, national rivalries, and ethnic tensions in Europe as a whole with one qualitative difference : in the East, they are life-threatening ; in the West, they are a new challenge for European economic and political integration. Europe became a more unstable continent, largely because the threats have been decentralized. From the point of view of the United States, Europe is a far less dangerous place than before because of the disappearing risks of a cataclysmic clash. America is no longer threatened from Eurasia by an ideologically motivated foe. <p> Unlike the old Federal Republic, united Germany can live no longer as an unassuming medium-sized power, protected against the uncertainties of today 's Europe in the slipstream of America 's predominant position. The end of the cold war prompts both countries to reexamine their priorities and commitments in Europe in general and in East Central Europe in particular. In the United States as well as in Germany, different schools of foreign policy thinking are trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategic thinking and political decisionmaking on both sides of the Atlantic can continue to run parallel. W. R. Smyser noticed that the " difficulties and disagreements that might result from a divergence of interests have, however, been exacerbated by a failure of mutual understanding. Neither Washington nor Bonn has shown much sensitivity for the new situation faced by the other. "( n1) For both countries it will be increasingly important to understand the factors likely to influence their respective strategic culture and political decisionmaking. Thus, I am focusing on some aspects of strategic culture and political decisionmaking in both countries. STUMBLING BLOCKS IN THE DEFINITION OF INTERESTS <p> I would like to first focus on the most unexpected and most unpredictable change that asks for reexamination : the breakdown of the economic, political, social, institutional, and even ideological structures in the formerly communist states of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, and its perception on both sides of the Atlantic. <p> Let me mention first the main obstacles that hinder a clear definition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the cold war asks for a reassessment. The first problem is that Germany 's political leaders and its academic and media elite reflexively reacted to the fundamental changes in Germany as if the unified country is nothing more than the enlarged Federal Republic, not only domestically but also in its foreign policy behavior. It is as Europeanized as it was in the 1980s beyond a concern for national interests.( n2) The pattern of the closeknit, economically prosperous country, populated by German speaking Europeans and unimpaired by the poor cousins in the East continues to determine German political decisionmaking long after it was shown to be false. With unification, the emergence from geostrategic purgatory, and the transformation from a previously divided front-line state into one of the strongest states on the European stage, Germany underwent a strategic transformation of breathtaking proportions. Germany reemerged as nation state, regaining full sovereignty. <p> The question now becomes how Germany will deal with her new situation in a changed Europe. Therefore, a certain renationalization of not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structurally necessary. Germany has grown into a new power dimension and become a focus of international interest as a power factor acting according to its national interest, a fact with which the majority of the political elite is extremely uncomfortable. Talking about Germany 's national interest uncovers a deep rooted mistrust that makes even Germany 's closest allies recall earlier German threats. Public opinion in Germany itself might regard a debate about national interest as a replay of earlier mistakes with catastrophic outcomes. Therefore, the elite remains most uncomfortable with the acceptance of national interests and leadership that was expressed by Christoph Bertram : " Germans today, probably regardless of generation and political conviction, are deeply embarrassed by such terms as vision ' and leadership, ' not least because of the twelve dreadful years in which their Fuhrer claimed both leadership and a certain vision, only to lead the country and all of Europe into catastrophe. "( n3) <p> Suspicion at home and abroad that the imprints of the past still shape the future hinders the effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing the appropriate policy for the future. This suspicion also precludes a straightforward debate on the implications of Germany 's emergence from geopolitical purgatory. <p> Renationalization, as I understand it, does not mean that one has to fear a new German Sonderweg( a unilateral special path), for Germany 's political and economic integration in the democratic West is a basic requirement for pursuing national interests. Germany is now in the same situation as the British and the French, who have never made a secret of pursuing national interests along with their European policies. Germany 's integration into the European Community( EC) or other collective bodies does not change the fact that its size, power, geography, and history make Germany not better or worse but simply different from any other nation-state.( n4) <p> While the political class in Germany seems to refuse a debate about national interests, the American political establishment seems deeply disappointed that the charming illusion of a new era of international stability under the leadership of the only remaining superpower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a lack of vision about U.S. political purposes in Eastern Europe. Through the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the self-containment of the old Federal Republic reaffirmed by German unification, the general setting of American policy on Europe that used to be " double containment " has come to its end.( n5) Since 1989-90, U.S. policy has become a process of evolution rather than leadership. <p> There is obviously a pattern to the debate over the ends and means of American foreign policy following a victory in war. Victory in the two world wars as well as in the cold war was followed by a period of thiumphalism. Americans confidently awaited the triumph of their democratic principles abroad, which would make the world a safe and better place. The triumphalism faded and was replaced by disillusionment both with their principles and with their allies. The principles could not guide policy in the messy and quickly changing post-war world, while the allies had interests and values that, in at least some cases, conflicted with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great debate about American foreign policy. <p> As President Clinton settled uncomfortably into the White House, the third stage was beginning to get under way, leaving the president, who has promised to focus on the economy, largely paralyzed in foreign policy decision making. It is ironic that a president elected on a program of domestic reform must preside over the greatest revolution in American foreign policy since the United States engaged in World War I. <p> The third hindrance is a widespread and profound misunderstanding of the nature of post-communism leading to poor policy decisions regarding conflict resolution in the post communist world. The current debate about Russia 's permanent crisis highlights the persistent misunderstandings of communism, as well as of post-communism, by much of the Western political elite. Inadequately, the very specific conditions of democratic capitalism are projected into the post-communist societies when designating them as " newly emerged democracies. " <p> Communist totalitarianism was nothing like traditional society. In her famous 1979 article, " Dictatorships and Double Standards, " Jeane J. Kirkpatrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other kind of traditional Western society.( n6) Communism destroyed the entire infrastructure of capitalism -- private property, respect for market forces, and social pluralism -- by force. Spain is a truIy dramatic demonstration of the opportunity to transform even an authoritarian dictatorship into democracy when the structural groundwork of capitalism is given. By rejecting the totalitarian model, many Western experts eluded the almost complete destruction of the bourgeois society under communist dictatorship. It should be underscored, however, that the economic, political, and social structures of any communist state are not compatible to any system now operating in the democratic West. <p> The distinction between totalitarianism and authoritarianism is not only a matter of historic interest and a topic of academic debates about who was right and who was wrong about communism. It is as useful to understand the nature of communism as it is necessary to comprehend the intrinsic features of post-communism. Because many experts reject the totalitarian model, they do not understand that none of the former communist states has transformed into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authoritarianism. Neither have they become democracies yet, for democracy depends on the political, economic, and moral-cultural institutions of capitalism that have only emerged embryonic in the former communist countries. They all are post-totalitarian and some of them are already pre-democratic. <p> Given this state of affairs, assistance in the transition from totalitarianism can not be made dependent on the existence of Western style democratic institutions and a market economy. On the contrary, the objective of support should be to assist in the creation and long-range development of democracy and a free market -- in short, democratic capitalism. Both a historical and long-term look at the processes occurring in post-communist countries shows that the whole approach must change ; the paradigm of reform has to be replaced by the paradigm of restoration.( n7) " The challenge to these countries, therefore, is not the the systemic reform of their economies through the refining or reorienting of current macro- or microeconomic policies, but the total transformation of their system into a market economy. The political, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the last forty years must be dismantled. "( n8) FRAGMENTATION OF THE EAST BLOC : NEW PROBLEMS FOR INTEREST DEFINITION <p> Any attempt to define national interests presupposes defining the subject with which one is dealing. Unless I am focusing my attention to East Central Europe, I have to define this region in the broader context of post-communist societies in transition. <p> The development of a competitive economy based on private ownership, the evolution of a pluralistic society, and the emergence of a democratic political system -- that is the historical and causal logic underlying the development of Western civilization. Post-communist societies, however, do not have centuries to make the transition to capitalism, nor is it possible for them to wait until a private competitive economy and a socially pluralistic society have evolved before beginning the establishment of democratic institutions. The historical uniqueness of transition from totalitarianism lies essentially in the need to shape what are actually natural and successive processes " in step " with political instruments. The conditions for this politically-led transformation vary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to see what the history of Eastern Europe tells, and to step inside to understand what domestic factors drive the policies of transition from communism. <p> Following the collapse of communism, whose stability depended on institutions that use force in order to ensure the survival of communist power, instability and ethnic nationalism spread throughout Eastern Europe. Paradoxically, ethnic nationalism that depends on culture, not on institutions, can provide both stability and civil war.( n9) <p> The broadest level of culture, as I understand it, creates distinguishing identities among peoples. Looking at culture, Eastern Europe is confronted with the clash of three different civilizations. There is the Judeo-Christian civilization, which has separated Western Christianity from Orthodoxy and Islam since the sixteenth century. The boundary separates Finland and the Baltic states from Russia, cuts through Belorussia and the Ukraine, separates Transylvania from the rest of Rumania, and follows almost exactly the line now separating Slovenia and torso-Croatia from the rest of former Yugoslavia.( n10) Given this historical background, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of communism, the once homogeneous communist bloc now forms three different regions :( n11) <p> East Central Europe, i.e., Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovenia, is composed of ethnically homogeneous countries. They share the common experiences and values of the Judeo-Christian culture, and they are generally better off than the peoples to the east. <p> Russia remains an empire with both a dominant ethnicity, the Russians, and a dominant culture, Orthodoxy. The dominant Russian ethnicity historically suppressed different cultures and ethnicities. <p> The European successor states of the Soviet Union, the Balkans and the Baltic states have to live with different ethnicities that are often hostile to each other as well as with different cultures that historically -- and as in the case of Yugoslavia at present -- clash. TWO WAYS OF RESTORING CAPITALISM <p> Given this state of affairs, two different ways of restoring capitalism in former Communist countries emerge. The East Central European countries have had remarkably bloodless revolutions, trying to create democratic capitalism from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. This is opposite from the way that democratic capitalism has historically emerged in the West. The resurrection of an intact social pluralism, however, needs even more time than the restoration of a free market. Therefore, political and ideological pluralism lack the stable groundwork of a socially diverse society for a transitional period. In between, the democratically elected government, the executive branch, is the only institution that can create a law based state, which stands for observing the rule of law, for private property, for a firm division of power. <p> For the East Central European post Communist countries, it is temporarily more effective to rely on state interventionism as a substitute for rudimentary social institutions to create the institutions of democratic capitalism, regardless of whether they prefer shock therapy, as in Poland, or gradualism, as in Hungary. Since the development of democratic capitalism is the result of a centrally managed process, state interventionism deserves support, as long as governments show bold, articulate, and determined leadership in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political doctrines, traditions, and attitudes, committed to traditional continental European ideas of cooperation between government, industry, and labor, rather perfectly fit the needs of these countries to restore democratic capitalism. <p> In the South Eastern European countries and the successor states of the former Soviet Union, it works the other way around. Creating democratic capitalism from the top is impossible in an empire in general and particularly in one the size of Russia. It is probably also impossible in those post-communist countries with different ethnicities that are often hostile to each other. All of these countries lack ethnic homogeneity as well as a religious or other cultural system of common values. The Soviet state divided czarist Russia into geographically based republics and regions as well as autonomous ethnic areas to give non-Russian ethnic groups a sense of self-rule, especially in cultural affairs. The end of the Soviet Union and the erosion of the Moscow-based central power has decentralized much of the national decisionmaking. Many of the republics -- as well as similar autonomous regions -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete independence. The district leaders no longer accept decisions from the center that do not enable them to assert their own agendas. The regional chieftains, almost all of them former Communist party bosses, take as much sovereignty as they can get, and act as they please.( n12) <p> The successor states of the former Soviet Union and the South East European countries follow another path to modernization : fragmentation first, capitalism second, democracy later. It is very likely that these countries develop market economies from the bottom up but lack democracy in the initial stage.( n13) Regional chieftains may lack democratic orientation, but when they introduce key elements of capitalism -- therefore setting in motion the forces of change that create democracy in the long run -- they should be supported, for the simple reason that process is more crucial than personality. Boris Yeltsin acts according to these processes, transferring power to the regional chieftains to overcome the resistance of the Soviet-style central bureaucracy. <p> Foreign aid should encourage capitalist developments as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Europe -- on the regional level. Unfortunately, the strategic thinking in the democratic West is focused mainly on the Moscow-based central government in particular, and on government action in general. At least in Russia, if not in all the successors of the Soviet Union and the South East European states, the central authorities do not have the power to create nationwide market economies and democratic institutions, regardless of whether the politicians in " power " call themselves democrats or nationalists, and regardless of whether they prefer gradualism or shock therapy. To help the people, not the bureaucrats, foreign aid in supporting central authorities is more likely to be a hindrance, subsidizing counterproductive static policies to retain a state-run economy and, therefore, strengthening the most authoritarian political forces. America 's political culture, stressing economic liberalism, and its ability to detect and promote private initiatives plays fully in this region, where the traditional European government-to-government economic strategies are likely to prove counterproductive. DIFFERENT ZONES OF STABILITY <p> Different ways of transition from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of post-communist countries, internal stability becomes a more important security issue than traditional power politics. Except for Russia and Ukraine, which can use their nuclear potential as their only remaining instrument of power politics and will clearly do so, post-communist countries lack the economic, political, and military means of power politics. They are no longer a military threat to the democratic West. But new, decentralized, and diffuse threats emerge : fragmentation, anarchy and chaos, border conflicts, ethnic conflicts potentially fuming into ethnic wars, mass emigration. <p> This brief and admittedly simplified assessment, however, allows the following conclusion : The once homogeneous East bloc now constitutes three different zones of security. This kind of division will last for a long period -- despite the initial euphoria to achieve the goal of a united, largely demilitarized, democratic, and prosperous Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals before the end of the century. <p> The zone of relative stability contains Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building liberal democracies, market economies, and pluralistic societies that fulfill the material and spiritual expectations of their citizens.( n14) <p> The zone of nuclear capability includes Russia and Ukraine, with their dangerous combination of fragmentation, economic, political, and social crisis, making them unstable and, to some extent, partly ungovernable, and their status of nuclear powers. <p> The zone of crisis means the countries between both of these zones that are confronted with the collapse of the old system on the one hand, and with a lack of new institutions, economic recovery, and political consensus on the other hand, finding themselves on the brink of social unrest or even civil war. <p> That is an entirely new situation with which Germany in its unique situation must first cope. The old Federal Republic used to be an importer of security in its broader sense and a direct beneficiary of the Atlantic Alliance 's system of collective defense. It " is now to become an exporter of Western political values, economic influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT IN GERMANY <p> Although I am aware of the risk of analytical oversimplification, I will nonetheless lay out three schools of thought in the German debate about East Central Europe as they have evolved up to this point, and these schools transcend party lines : <p> The pacifist school could be located on the Left, which is still in conceptual confusion after German unification and the collapse of communism. Its essential point is " third-way-thinking, " which has been critical to Western capitalism as well as to Soviet-style communism throughout the cold war. It became apparent especially in the movement against the " euromissiles " in the early 1980s. Some of its principles -- pacifism, nonmilitary collective security, a clear rejection of power politics, and a certain sympathy for Mitteleuropa that is rooted in third-way thinking -- persist. This school has influence only in the sense that it is able to disturb the decisionmaking process. <p> The school of " Zivilmacht "( civilian power) could be characterized by the belief that -- despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign policy that takes international relations beyond the world of nation states, of power politics in general and the use of force in particular.( n16) I would like to run counter common observations of Germany as a tamed or civil power. Collective policies proved to be the most efficient instruments to pursue German national interests until 1989. <p> Since detente and Ostpolitik, Germany defines its national interest in Europe as collective and pan-European, embedded in the framework of collective security in which institutions such as the EC, the CSCE, and NATO replace the nation states and in which political and economic means prevail. It became conventional wisdom that the very special German national interest -- unification -- could be achieved only in the framework of pan-European unification. It became a self-deception that German national interests were identical with, at least, European interests, if not with Western interests at all. That was very convenient because one could avoid a debate about special German national interests with its embarrassing and unavoidable references to Germany 's Nazi past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war is clearly based on those basic assumptions that German national interest is identical with collective European interests : deepening EC integration leading to political union in the West, stabilizing the reform process in the countries of Eastern Europe and widening the EC eastward, expanding and institutionalizing the CSCE process, limiting the military tasks of the Western alliance and its transformation into a mainly political organization, and restructuring the transAtlantic relationship in order to prevent the renationalization of security policy in general, and Germany 's security policy in particular.( n17) But a look at the evidence, i.e., Kohl 's initial unilateral action in the unification process, the Persian Gulf war, the Yugoslav crisis, and other cases, shows that the pursuit of national interest has certainly become the center of foreign policy. The rejection of " outdated " realist ideas of power and the nation state allows comfortably to hide the redefinition of united Germany 's national interests in the post-cold war world behind common European or transatlantic policies.( n18) <p> To generalize, this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and post-totalitarian societies. It overestimates the degree of the democratic West 's " Europeanization " and underestimates the perseverance of the nation states both in the West and the East of the continent. <p> The school of responsive power politics seems to have reemerged in German political thinking since the end of the cold war. However, there was always a minority that called for a return to the classic tools of geopolitical analysis, and a debate about power politics as well as about national interests without narrowing the definition of power to military power.( n19) If power is defined as the ability to shape outcomes of events, Germany has become the decisive power factor in European -- pan-European -- politics : The integration of Eastern Europe, the economic recovery of these countries, the creation of a security structure that fills the vacuum in the East, and the developing of the economic dynamism of the EC that is necessary to produce the economic recovery process in the eastern portion of the continent, depend on Germany. <p> I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new situation with which Germany is confronted because Germany, in its unique geopolitical situation at the crossroads between Eastern and Western Europe, does have special interests in Eastern Europe that are not necessarily in harmony with the interests of the other West Europeans or the United States. This means that long before the case for collective decisionmaking has emerged, the Federal Republic must make national decisions. Germany is going to implement its special interests during collective decisionmaking, which limits the margin of communities and asks for German unilateral action in cases when collective decisions are unattainable. That is a departure from Germany 's postwar behavior, when its foreign politics consisted of being a selfeffacing follower. Even marginal differences with the partners were routinely followed by a word of gratitude and a word of apology for the Nazi past. It is also a departure from the self-deception that the nation state in Europe is disappearing and is going to be replaced by a collective but single political actor : the European Union. <p> With the emergence of the school of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany that has many similarities with the mainstream of American strategic thinking. Some irritations that are resulting from different ways of thinking probably will be cleared up. SCHOOLS OF THINKING IN THE UNITED STATES <p> In the United States, democratic idealists as well as political realists think in terms of power politics, regardless of whether power is used for moral purposes to make the world safe and democratic or used to achieve national interests. Despite the disappearance of the Soviet challenge, political realists believe that the " continued aim of the USA should be to prevent any other power from achieving undivided control over regions whose resources would put a worldwide power potential in its hands. "( n20) Democratic idealists believe that the only remaining superpower does have to lead in organizing international cooperation and promoting the setting up of international institutions to cope with global interdependence and its resulting problems. <p> Despite many fundamental differences between both schools, the East Central European countries are neither crucial to counterbalancing the European powers, Russia and Germany, nor are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collective security. From an American angle, East Central Europe 's importance is a relative one : it is a function of American interests in relation to first Russia and then to Germany.( n21) <p> From a German point of view, East Central Europe is important because it forms Germany 's protective zone of stability. That is a fundamentally different approach, which distinguishes Germany and the United States and must be understood on both sides of the Atlantic. <p> Aside from a small group of truly democratic idealists who believe that fulfilling America 's destiny means exporting human rights and democracy elsewhere, including the former communist countries of East Central Europe, and some immigrant pressure groups, political thinking in the United States is focused on Russia.( n22) If at all, the eastern European states were generally dealt with in relation to the Soviet Union and its policies toward the West. The cold war pattern seems to remain. In fact, the United States does have a tremendous stake in Russia 's transition from totalitarianism. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of arms control agreements, the cooperative international relations the United States has established with Russia, the political stability of Eurasia, and the survival of many newly independent states all depend on whether Russia becomes a stable post-communist state. <p> Democratic idealism 's underlying assumption is that the political and economic system in respective countries decides the relations between them. There is no doubt that democratization and marketization will create policies that are mainly congruent with those of the Western democracies. Between democracies, traditional security policy has largely lost its impact. It is extremely unlikely that democracies would wage war against one another. At least in the initial period of euphoria and thriumphalism the democratic idealist tradition has been reflected in the declarations that the promotion of democracy in the world should become the leading principle of American foreign policy after the cold war. <p> As I have already shown, the state of postcommunist societies has been misinterpreted and, consequently, the prospects of marketization and democratization have been extremely overestimated. I think that every step toward democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserves careful support. However, in the extremely fragile and unpredictable period of transition, the democratic West should avoid the danger of misinterpreting domestic politics and personalizing foreign policy, as it did with Mikhail Gorbatchev, thereby finding itself hopelessly behind the curve after having poured tens of billions of dollars in a black hole, hoping to be able to build a stable democracy in an. empire that lacks virtually every precondition to do so. <p> The dominant realistic thinking in the United States assumes that since security concerns vis-a-vis Russia are paramount, a democracy-frst policy in this region stands no reasonable chance of success. Meanwhile, between post-communism and the emergence of some variant of democracy -- which could be decades, not a few short years -- many awful things might and probably will occur in the former Soviet Union. None of these probable occurrences would have a direct and negative impact on U.S. national interests, except the loss of central-nuclear command and control. The United States remains vitally interested in that Russia is going to devolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and foreign policy, whatever its democratic standards. Even if the centralized economy collapses, regions within Russia and other successor states of the Soviet Union split, and ethnic sulking moves into ethnic wars in some regions, this kind of central authority should be supported, regardless of who is in power. <p> The dominant political realists, as well as their democratic idealist counterparts, endlessly debate whether the United States should export democracy and market economy or conduct a foreign policy that deals with the post-totalitarian undemocratic realities in Russia. These debates are highly superficial. There is no either/or. With respect to post-cold war Eastern Europe, Joseph Nye points out that the " realist view of world order is necessary but not sufficient, because it does not take into account the long term societal changes. "( n23) On the other hand, no one can decide what domestic policies any Russian government is able or willing to adopt. Even very differenciated support that fits completely the different needs in the regions is likely to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of Russia 's economy, politics, and society, there is no chance of anyone financing and organizing a smooth and rapid transition. <p> Traditionalist political realists assume that Russia is trying to restore its traditional hegemony in Eastern Europe while Germany is going to extend its sphere of influence through Eastern Europe, thus becoming a hegemonist power that threatens the United States in this region. As Ivo John Lederer pointed out in his introduction of a Council on Foreign Relations book, " in formulating its policy toward Eastern Europe, the United States must strike a balance between the growing power of Germany and a currently weakened Russia that will surely rise again. "( n24) Therefore, the United States should concentrate foreign aid on the countries between these two potentially hegemonist powers to prevent hegemony and to guarantee the balance of powers. This classic realist approach probably would please many Eastern European politicians who think their countries are being neglected in favor of Russia, which is emerging as the major U.S. partner -- as well as problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proves that American strategic thinking is focused on Russia and Germany, neglecting the East Central European countries. <p> The third definition of interests is focused on Russia as well, and is essentially isolationist. With the end of the Soviet Union, nuclear strikes against the United States are extremely unlikely. The use of small scale nuclear weapons within the former Soviet Union in civil wars, however awful in human terms, remains regional, environmentally tolerable, and not directly threatening to Americans. Before the United States mobilizes to spend tens of billions of dollars to save Europe for the third time in this century, they might consider that simple geography means Europe 's stake in these problems is much greater than America 's. If Eastern Europe really becomes a much less stable place, American troops should withdraw. The farther the U.S. military is from Eastern and Central Europe, the less likely that they will become embroiled in civil strife or Yugoslav-style conflicts. CONCLUSIONS <p> Strategic culture and political decisionmaking are different in Germany and the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However, in trying to fit the puzzle together, some basic interest definitions -- that are, however, results of different ways of strategic thinking -- emerge : <p> Given Germany 's limited resources, its historical burden, and its special military nonnuclear status, Germany has to look carefully at the developments in the different regions of Eastern Europe and has to differentiate between the different security regions as well as between the most dangerous and the most likely scenarios. <p> Its primary concern is to maintain the zone of stability east of its borders by supporting the restoration of democratic capitalism in these countries. Having experienced the relatively successful but extremely costly experiment of transforming the former East German communist system, Germany can now take a long term, patient view of those countries ' transition from totalitarianism with an almost clear mid-term purpose : These countries are a protective buffer zone against the spillover of chaos and anarchy. " Germany will become the ' expert ' in reconstructing communist economies, a skill that will serve the country well in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long run.( n25) East Central Europeans have ambivalent feelings about German influence and power in the region. They want the United States to be engaged in Eastern Europe, partly to balance a resurgent Germany. On the other hand, Germany 's eastern neighbors, in particular the new elites, acknowledge that only a strong Germany can help contain nationalism and help stabilize Eastern Europe. They appreciate Germany 's commitment to democracy and its sensitivities about its own past, and so they could learn to appreciate German leadership in that region, too.( n26) <p> As the United States once stabilized Western Europe and allowed Germany to rebuild its economy and construct a firm democracy. so should America now accept and support Germany in leading the change in East Central Europe and laying the foundation for stable democratic capitalist societies there.( n27) <p> Germany is interested in bringing the countries of its buffer closer to and finally into the European Community, not only for security reasons but for the simple purpose of sharing the burden of reconstruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- in connection with Austria 's membership -- Slovenia, are potential EC members. The EC must formulate clear and objective criteria that these countries must meet as they move closer to full membership in the EC. There can not be a timetable for a potential member state, for membership is not a problem of time, it is a problem of EC compatibility, which includes new forms of association on the way to membership. <p> Germany does not have either the capability or the resources to support extensively the transition from totalitarianism in the zone of instability. There is great concern that instability will spread, thereby undercutting Germany 's general strategy of stabilizing the buffer zone. However, Germany finds itself with a lack of policy instruments with which to pursue its effort to contain instability. The most decisive instrument -- the use of German troops in collective peacekeeping, peacemaking, or combat operations -- is virtually blocked by legal, political, and historical-psychological means. Given common interests with the countries of this region and Germany 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrels, the CSCE is the almost perfect instrument of cooperation with these countries and of avoiding engagement in the region 's unsolvable problems. <p> The United States, as well as Germany, does have an elemental interest in Russia remaining predictable, at least in its foreign policy behavior. For different reasons, however, both countries lack the instruments to support significantly Russia 's domestic efforts to overcome the endemic political turbulence, administrative dislocation, and economic collapse there. With a commitment of approximately sixty billion dollars to the former Soviet Union, Germany has reached the limit of its capacity. By mid-1994, with the complete withdrawal of the Russian troops that still remain in Eastern Germany, the most important constraint of financial support for Russia is going to be dropped. Americans feel that they have reached the limit of their resources. I suspect that, beyond a limited aid in practical, micro forms of assistance that will promote privatization and pluralization on the ground there, no matter what happens inside the Kremlin, both countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Russia for a while. <p> Germany is clearly overburdened and, in addition, it lacks the military instruments -- a nuclear capability -- to cope with the nuclear power of Russia and Ukraine. Although they are relatively benign now, Russia and Ukraine remain major European powers, both in nuclear and conventional terms. Germany 's very limited option is an effort to coordinate policies with Russia and Ukraine about developments in the zone of instability as well in its buffer strip. <p> Germany and the United States also have a common interest in Russia 's central government remaining in full control over the nuclear forces, and in the Soviet nuclear arsenal fragmenting further. The United States ' special interest is in coping with Russia 's strategic nuclear forces, while Germany 's is mainly in the control of short- and medium-range forces. <p> From this point of view, the United States is able to counterbalance the strategic forces bilaterally, while Germany needs NATO to provide the necessary balance to Russia 's and Ukraine 's short- and medium-range nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, especially, the U.S. presence in Europe, as well as the U.S. nuclear guarantee for Europe, remain indispensable for Germany, which has no nuclear power, to maintain a minimal nuclear deterrence against Russia and Ukraine -- at least until a functioning European defense union that includes a nuclear capability has been created. <p> Partnership between the United States and Germany was grounded for more than forty years in the common effort of containment against the homogeneous Soviet Empire. This empire has been fragmented, and so have the interests of the partners. <p> Germany has emerged as the point nation for managing the results of the wreckage of the old East bloc 's Central European part. This emergence offers opportunities and risks, but growing influence is unavoidable, meaning that in East Central Europe Germany is going to occupy a dominant position in the years to come. Germany sees a direct relationship between political stability and economic, political, and administrative support for the transition from totalitarianism. For the purpose of a peaceful change to democracy, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Central Europe. Any failures in this process constrain Germany from leading West European efforts to contain the spread of anarchy and chaos. It is bound to lead anyway in the region. <p> The problems of transition from totalitarianism that now arise in East Central Europe will not disturb the global balance, which is America 's principal concern. America has to cope with the nuclear powers of Russia and Ukraine, which are part of the global balance. From an American standpoint, therefore, Germany, backed by the European Community, can cope with the problems to its immediate east. <p> The differences in German and American perceptions show that they would not always find it easy to coordinate their policies in Eastern Europe.

There must be genuine power sharing and responsibility sharing in Eastern Europe. <p>
