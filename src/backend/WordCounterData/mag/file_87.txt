I confess : Until recently I had n't been to the dentist in almost three years. And believe me, I had no business disregarding my dental health. I 've had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father has been wearing a complete set of dentures since his teens, and -- this is embarrassing-I can typically count on one hand the number of times I flossed in a month. You would think that a person with teeth like mine would make dental appointments a priority. But the truth is I " forget " to see the dentist the same way I " forget " to deal with the junk closet I 've been meaning to organize for more than a year. Whatever the reason you put off making a doctor 's appointment-you 're scared, too busy, or just plain lazy -- you should at least know what you 're risking health-wise when you do procrastinate. Here, which doctor 's appointments you should definitely be making-and keeping-and what can happen if you let the visit " slip your mind. " MUST-KEEP APPOINTMENT #1 : YOUR FANILY DOCTOR OR INTERNIST How often you should go : Every three years after the age of 20, according to the American Academy of Family Physicians. Just seeing your ob/gyn does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ob/gyns only look at a small percentage of your total body, and while you may get your blood pressure and weight checked, you still need a full physical from your family physician to check other body systems : your heart and lungs, your digestive organs, your skin( skin cancer is the number three cancer in women 25 to 35), and so on. How long you can put it off : Don't-very few of us are considered healthy enough to let appointments slide longer than three years. " Healthy enough " means you 're a nonsmoker, eat a low -- fat, varied diet, exercise regularly, practice safe sex, limit alcohol intake, perform monthly breast self-examinations, protect yourself from the sun, and have no family history of disease. How to stop skipping appointments : Do you fear a reprimand from your doctor if it 's been a while? " If your doctor scolds you, you may need a new one, " says Bruce Bagley, M.D., a family physician in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's possible they 've let some of their checkups slide. It is not unusual for doctors to assume they can detect their own ailments just because they 've had medical training. So stop cringing and take steps to get the most out of your " comeback visit. " " When you make your appointment, tell the receptionist that you have n't seen the doctor in a while, and ask her what tests and examinations will be performed, " says Don Price, a practice management consultant in Ottawa, Ontario. " This will allow time to make a list of any long-term health concerns that might not be covered in a routine annual examination. " Photograph Do n't amass appointment reminders-act on them! // MUST-KEEP APPOINTMENT #2 : YOUR OB/GYN How often you should go : Once a year -- no ifs, ands, or buts. All women need a routine pelvic and breast examination. If you take oral contraceptives, suffer from a recurrent problem like urinary tract infections or yeast infections, or have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to face the stirrups more often. How long you can put it off : Do n't even think about it. The risks you take by not going to the gynecologist make the trip well worth it. Annual Pap smears will pick up any cell abnormalities that could be the first signs of an STD or cancer -- which is best caught early. " I see patients who have n't had a Pap in years, " says Mary Jane Bovo, M.D., an ob/gyn in private practice in New York City. " By then they 've got an invasive cancer and need immediate treatment. It does n't happen often, but it can. It 's distressing for a doctor, because you ca n't make them come in for an appointment. " How to stop skipping appointments : One of the main reasons women avoid the gynecologist is that they do n't feel comfortable with their doctor. But it may help to think of your doctor as you would anyone else you 'd hire. You would n't keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him or trust him. Get referrals you can trust by asking friends and co-workers who have the same health plan you do. And when you find a candidate, think of the first appointment as a time to discuss your concerns to see if your personalities mesh well. Finding a doctor you 're comfortable with will make all the difference when you have to go in for your next annual exam. MUST-KEEP APPOINTMENT #3 : YOUR DERMATOLOGIST How often you should go : Depending on your medical history, maybe not at all. But if you have a family history of skin cancer, or have unusual or more than 50 moles or skin markings, you should probably see a dermatologist at least once to determine whether you 're at high risk. How long you can put it off : Not longer than a year if you have a family history of melanoma, since this type of skin cancer develops quickly-and can kill quickly, says Alexa Boer Kimball, M.D., a professor of dermatology at Stanford University. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin cancer, like basal cell carcinoma, you can afford to lag as much as every year and a half, since these types take up to five years to develop. Nevertheless, it 's smart to get in for a skin check annually, since these non-life-threatening types of cancers can still be disfiguring if they spread unchecked. If you notice any changes in moles-size, shape, or color-you should also see a skin doc as soon as possible to determine how often they need to be checked( which can range from every six months to every two years). How to stop skipping appointments : Stop fooling yourself-even if you do your own skin exams, it 's tough to self-check some parts of the body, like your back, your scalp, and your ears. " Some skin cancers, like melanoma, can show up on the soles of the feet, which people usually neglect, " says Kimball. If your family practitioner performs skin checks-and many do-that may not be enough either. " Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students only get a couple of weeks of training in dermatology-and that may not be enough, " she says. MUST-KEEP APPOINTMENT #4 : YOUR DENTIST How often you should go : At least twice a year for a cleaning and a checkup. The reason? Unlike other medical problems such as colds or rashes, mouth conditions rarely heal themselves ; they only get worse. How long you can put it off : If you only got to the dentist once this year, it 's okay. But get back on the twice a year track : " Do n't be misled if you have no pain or bleeding ; oral cancers and gum disease are virtually symptomless until they 're in their end stages, " says Christine Dumas, a dentist in Los Angeles. There 's more than just your oral health at stake : " Unchecked bacterial buildup could lead to periodontal disease, which is also associated with strokes, heart attacks, or if you 're pregnant, preterm birth. A dental visit can even tell you whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Richard H. Price, a dentist in Newton, MA. How to stop skipping appointments : Fight your fear. Nearly 20 percent of us fear the dentist so much we avoid exams. To ease your anxiety, Timothy A. Smith, Ph.D., an expert on dental phobias at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine and Dentistry in Lexington, advises that you start out with a consultation, " just to talk to the dentist about what 's going to be done so you know exactly what to expect. " Next, schedule an innocuous procedure such as a cleaning. If you ca n't make the jump to more involved procedures like getting a cavity filled, ask for a painkiller such as lidocaine or the sedative nitrous oxide( both may be covered by insurance). Sidebar SPEND LESS TIME IN THE WAITING ROOM Sidebar So you finally make that appointment, and how do you spend your afternoon? Waiting and waiting and waiting to see the doctor. Cut the frustration and wasted time with these insider 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointments for first thing in the morning or right after lunch to ensure that you 're not stuck in the waiting room while previous patients ' appointments run long.( Avoid Mondays, which tend to be hectic Sidebar because emergency patients who 've been sick over the weekend get dibs on the doctor 's time.) * DO N'T PLAY THE WAITING GAME. Before you leave for the doctor 's office, call to ask the receptionist if the doctor is running behind schedule. * ASK AHEAD. If you 're going to see a doctor for particular tests or procedures, ask the office staff for specifics : Will you have to see more than one doctor for the tests? Will you have to go to a lab on another floor for the procedure? Sidebar When the results are in, will you have to come back for another visit? If you know these answers beforehand, you wo n't be surprised when a visit becomes a long -- drawn-out affair. * MAKE A HIT LIST. Before you go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things you want to discuss with her and prioritize them. Consider having the office staff give a copy of the list to your doctor while you 're in the waiting room so that you and your doctor are both prepared once your exam starts. // <p>
