2012641 For my son Jeremy, age ten, the fad right now is Pogs. Any time we go shopping, I know I 'm going to be prodded to buy more of these...( " I really need a Thumper, Mom! "). When he was ten, my other son, Danny, insisted that most of his clothes have Blue Jays logos or designs on them. Now he 's " too old " for that, and he wants more sophisticated clothing( Home Improvement T-shirts are popular). He 's traded in the comfortable sweatpants he once wore on every occasion for loose-fitting blue jeans. Both of them are solidly committed to the Baseball Cap as a fashion statement. Each night when they go to bed, the Cap of the Day is carefully hung over the bedpost, topping a stack of baseball caps. In the morning, a new cap will be just as carefully selected. They are worn indoors, outdoors, to school -- although a few teachers require their removal in the classroom -- and, of course, at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fad and keeping up with the newest fashion suddenly becomes incredibly important. It can be a shock when the child who cheerfully wore hand-me-downs or whatever you picked up at the store abruptly refuses to wear anything that is n't approved by her peers. Parents are often worried about the cost of the current fashions( the most popular item is almost invariably the most expensive) and that their children are too caught up in being " one of the crowd. " Other parents find watching their children begin to make independent choices about what to wear very stressful -- they may feel as though they are losing control. If this sounds familiar, try not to take your child 's choice of clothing or activity as a personal rejection -- do n't forget that your preteen needs to feel that she can be her own person. As Oakville, Ontario parent educator Dianne Banks says : " Parents should remember that fitting in with their friends is very important to children of this age. Even if you do n't find the clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends are wearing similar styles having the right clothes can mean a lot. " Of course, it is n't always possible to buy your child the " in " thing. " If it 's something your child really wants, but it 's beyond your budget, let him know that you would really like to be able to get it but ca n't afford to. Perhaps you can work out a way for the child to earn the money, or perhaps it could be a special birthday gift. " Often, having a few of the " right " clothes will be more important than having many changes of clothing. Dan, for example, has decided he 'd rather have a couple of pairs of jeans( which he washes frequently) than a half-dozen pairs of sweatpants that would cost the same amount of money.( See how responsible a preteen can be when he needs to be!) While a preoccupation with fads, fashions and fitting in is a normal stage, some parents worry because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary, age ten, differs from many of her friends in that she seems completely unconcerned with clothes and fashion : " Mary plays hockey and soccer and loves sports. I guess she is more worried about whether her clothes are comfortable than about how they look on her, " say Stuart. " When I threw her old running shoes away, she actually fished them out of the garbage because she said they were more comfortable than the new ones. " Banks assures parents in Susan Stuart 's situation that their kids are doing fine. " It 's OK to support a child who wants to fit in by wearing the clothes that are in style, but we also need to let our children know that it 's OK to be different. " And, of course, Mary 's interests may change as she gets older. In a couple of years, she could feel the way 11-year-old Kiera Beitel does : " My mom says, " Why do you have to have this shirt? What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have the right clothes and stuff, other kids make fun of you. If I wore the clothes my mom likes, I would n't even be able to go to school. It would be too embarrassing. " Your first few experiences with your kid 's quest for the " right " stuff are not likely to be your last -- in fact, with the teen years looming, this may be just the beginning. But if you start to feel exasperated, try to remember how you felt about having certain clothes or games when you wanted to fit in with your peers. Then you may realize just how crucial a Pog can be. <p>
