4024841 The 100 Best Films of the Last 25 Years. MEN IN BLACK #47 THE MATRIX #12 FIGHT CLUB #32 MOULIN ROUGE #10 BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN #31 PRETTY WOMAN #37 CASINO BOYALE #19 1 Pulp Fiction 1994 It 's a low-down dirty tale of L.A. hitmen, palookas, and femmes fatales -- and also a time-warping, mind-bending work of movie-mad genius. It 's a feast of ultraviolent thrills -- and also a heady pop-literate consideration of surf rock, foot massages, diner culture, and honor among scoundrels. You 'd be hard-pressed, by now, to name a moment from Quentin Tarantino 's film that is n't iconic. Its revolutionary structure( John Travolta dies... then lives!) opened a new universe of mainstream storytelling, but the eternal joy of Pulp Fiction is that it recast the future of movies by living, so thrillingly, in the moment. 2 The Lord of the Rings trilogy 2001 -- 03 Peter Jackson did the impossible. He filmed an unfilmable novel, he conjured a dark, ravishing vision all his own without desecrating J.R.R. Tolkien 's, he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie, he got a riveting performance out of a slithery CG cave dweller with a split personality -- and, what 's more, he made fantasy a box office monster. 3 Titanic 1997 The one disaster movie that 's also a primal work of popular art. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet strike romantic sparks, but the beauty of James Cameron 's epic is that it knows all too well their breathless affair would n't have lasted had it not been for that iceberg. In Titanic, it 's death that makes love eternal( and worthy of 100 hankies). The sinking of the ship, which plays out in what feels like real time, is one of the cinema 's great spectacles of beauty and dread. 4 Blue Velvet 1986 Lots of directors have exposed the rot at the core of white-picket-fence America, but David Lynch picks past the clichs and finds screaming insects, a severed ear, and a psycho with an oxygen mask. More than that, he merges them all into an eroticized Hardy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995 Yes, it was the first entirely computer-generated feature film, but Pixar 's technological achievement paled next to its creative one. Like Winnie the Pooh before it, Toy Story brought the secret lives of playthings to light with real warmth but also with a ricocheting humor that finally made boring family movies an endangered species. 6 Saving Private Ryan 1998 From the cathartic shock and terror of its opening D-Day sequence, Steven Spielberg 's World War II masterpiece depicts the chaos and slaughter of modern war with a virtuosity no other film has matched. The movie 's greatness lies in the way its moral fervor emerges from that blood-spattered bravura. 7 Hannah and Her Sisters 1986 Annie Hall and Manhattan are perfect movies, and this one -- in which Woody Allen grapples sunnily with the darkest questions of love, marriage, God, life -- is as rich and deep. 8 The Silence of the Lambs 1991 Jonathan Demme 's serial-killer film was classy enough to win an Academy Award for Best Picture Oscar, and gruesome enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( who has a cameo). Jodie Foster is lit up with resourcefulness and nerve as an FBI trainee forced to confront every sort of demon. And Anthony Hopkins chills as Hannibal Lecter, a man who knows you should always serve white wine with fish and Chianti with census takers. 9 Die Hard 1988 " Yippee-ki-yay, melon farmer! " Yes, we 'd even watch a censored version. It 's that good. 10 Moulin Rouge 2001 Audacious in its madcap use of music, daring in its unabashed embrace of romance, Australian director Baz Luhrmann 's Moulin Rouge taps into all the passion of the old movie musicals while recharging them for this century. 11 This Is Spinal Tap 1984 This one goes to 11. 12 The Matrix 1999 " What is the Matrix? " The answer, as we now know, is that it 's the father of two ho-hum sequels. But the Wachowski brothers ' first trip through the virtual-reality looking glass remains an action-movie classic that boasts both bullets and brains. 13 GoodFellas 1990 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a highway with something banging in the trunk. Then think of the last shot : Henry Hill( Ray Liotta) marooned on a suburban doorstep in his bathrobe. Now consider all the other classic scenes and set pieces in between. Along with Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, this is Scorsese 's most ferocious and virtuosic work. 14 Crumb 1995 One of the great portraits of an artist( in this case, the screwy and yet sympathetic cartoonist R. Crumb), this movie is proof that a well-wrought documentary can be as rich and rewarding as any fiction film. 15 Edward Scissorhands( 1990) Tim Burton 's pastel-colored, break-your-heart career highpoint -- and the beginning of many fans ' love affair with an elusive, eccentric young man named Johnny Depp. 16 Boogie Nights 1997 Boogie Nights is not short on drugs, violence, or sex. But writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson 's real interest lies in skillfully detailing the pseudo-familial relationships of his porn-industry characters. It 's like The Waltons, but with a massive prosthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance. Cameron Crowe 's most quotable script. Unbeatable support from Cuba Gooding Jr., Rene Zellweger( in her breakout film), and -- remember this little guy? -- Jonathan Lipnicki. Jerry Maguire is what every big-studio, star-vehicle blockbuster should aspire to be. 18 Do the Right Thing 1989 When Rosie Perez shadowbox-dances to " Fight the Power " over the opening credits, you know you 're in for something special. Over the course of a single blistering day in Bed-Stuy, Spike Lee introduces us to an entire world contained on one city street, only to blow it up with dynamite in the climactic scenes. 19 Casino Royale 2006 You can talk about Daniel Craig 's perfectly toned bod all you like( go on, we 'll wait). But in this James Bond franchise revamp -- more of a rebirth, really -- the actor also offers a perfectly toned performance as a killing machine who 's barely aware that he has a heart until it gets slashed to ribbons. 20 The Lion King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vistas courtesy of Disney animators, and a plot with Hamlet-size ambitions : not bad for a supposed kids ' flick. 21 Schindler 's List 1993 A shattering tale of unlikely heroism in the face of rank evil. It 's easy to forget the considerable risks that director Steven Spielberg took in making an extremely long, black-and-white, and essentially starless film about the Holocaust. The movie itself, on the other hand, you will never forget. 22 Rushmore 1998 Wes Anderson 's breakthrough comedy is, like its predecessor The Graduate, a mannered, idiosyncratic, and hilarious coming-of-age tale that makes amazing use of its rock soundtrack and features a decidedly odd love triangle : Bill Murray 's middle-aged businessman, Olivia Williams ' widowed teacher, and, of course, Jason Schwartzman 's ardent schoolboy. 23 Memento 2001 Memento is that rare indie : a small oddity that somehow manages to outdazzle films that cost much more to make. Telling the story( backward, if you recall) of a noir hero afflicted with short-term memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time it launched Christopher Nolan( The Dark Knight), who 's now one of Hollywood 's craftiest big-budget directors. 24 A Room With a View 1986 Dismiss the evenly composed, well-behaved, and gussied-up films of Merchant Ivory as " boring " at your own peril. A Room With a View is a firecracker lit by its fuse, leading lady Helena Bonham Carter. Deeply romantic, it is the apotheosis of its genre : the exquisitely made chick flick. 25 Shrek 2001 By taking relentless( and funny!) potshots at the Disney formula, the ogre with the Mike Myers brogue -- and the gloriously anarchic pop soundtrack -- made ugly the new beautiful. 26 Hoop Dreams 1994 Nearly 100 years of documentary film preceded Hoop Dreams -- and 14 years of copycat docs have followed it -- but, truly, nothing before or since has managed to feel so quietly epic. As we watch two poor, black Chicago teens try to make it to the NBA, we 're hooked into their every surge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as cinema 's greatest action heroine in James Cameron 's monstrously good war-in-space sequel. But let 's not forget the unlikely contribution of future Mad About You star Paul Reiser as the film 's deliciously doomed corporate scumbag. To quote Bill Paxton 's motormouthed space marine : " You 're dog meat, pal. " 28 Wings of Desire 1988 The story of two angels who hover unseen around Berlin, listening in as humans grapple with the stuff of life, until one of them( Bruno Ganz) decides to go mortal. Gorgeous, leisurely, and bursting with ideas, Wings is European cinema par excellence. 29 The Bourne Supremacy 2004 What 's more dangerous than an amnesia-stricken government hitman? A vengeance-fueled amnesia-stricken government hitman. Director Paul Greengrass ' sequel made Doug Liman 's by-no-means-sluggish original Bourne Identity look like it had been stuck in reverse. 30 When Harry Met Sally... 1989 Though they owe a thing or two to Woody Allen and Diane Keaton in Annie Hall, Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are, by now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2005 The cool move here would be to ignore the fact that Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal enacted a truly groundbreaking love story -- and simply concentrate on what a gorgeous, nuanced, heartbreaking movie Brokeback is for people of any sexual orientation. But Ang Lee 's undeniably romantic movie did break ground. It reached, and moved, mainstream audiences in ways that no " gay " movie ever had before. 32 Fight Club 1999 This violent, hilarious, and tricksy dissection of modern manhood represents a career pinnacle for director David Fincher, Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Meat Loaf. Yes, it 's even better than Bat Out of Hell. 33 The Breakfast Club 1985 The film that made a generation of high schoolers actually want to get detention, thanks to the tragicomic script by director John Hughes and standout performances from its five young leads, Paul Gleason 's principal Vernon, and, of course, John Kapelos ' Carl the janitor. 34 Fargo 1996 The Coen brothers have always been great yarn spinners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly told tale. 35 The Incredibles 2004 Pixar had already demonstrated they could make terrific CG movies about toys, monsters, and fish. The Incredibles showed they could do the same with people. The project 's MVP? Director Brad Bird, who also wrote the film and voiced tyrannical, half-pint-size costume designer Edna Mode. 36 Spider-Man 2 2004 From the opening pizza delivery sequence to Spidey 's subway train battle with Alfred Molina 's Otto Octavius, this second film boasts more thrill-packed scenes than Doc Ock has mechanical arms. 37 Pretty Woman 1990 It was a bit of a throwback -- a **27;3976;TOOLONG fairy tale -- even when it first came out. Yet it announced the arrival of a post-feminist princess culture, complete with Richard Gere playing an early incarnation of Mr. Big. More than anything, it was the moment we all fell in love with Julia Roberts, and we 've never fallen out. 38 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 2004 Should scientists ever actually invent a method to wipe away memories of unpleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch the part of your brain that remembers watching screenwriter Charlie Kaufman 's most mind-blowing two hours. 39 The Sixth Sense 1999 You know how it ends. And yes, its success begat far too many twist finales, a couple of them also written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. But do n't undersell how elegantly Shyamalan and Bruce Willis( in his richest performance) build to their " gotcha. " 40 Speed 1994 A bus that will blow up if its speed falls below 50 mph... is n't that the stuff of straight-to-video grade-Z action movies? Maybe so. But put Jan De Bont behind the camera, get Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock to play action-cute, and tell Dennis Hopper to push his " Extra Extra Crazy " acting button, and you 've got yourself one hell of a ride. 41 Dazed and Confused 1993 Richard Linklater 's free-flowing comedy about the last day( and night) of high school in 1976 is as organic as a Robert Altman film, as knowing a look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as pure a portrait of the stoned joys of life in the free-ride ' 70s as the movies have given us. 42 Clueless 1995 A few references in this high school comedy may have today 's teens reaching for their history books.( Who was this " Pauly Shore " personage, exactly?) But writer-director Amy Heckerling 's script still crackles, while Alicia Silverstone 's central performance as a lovable airhead remains, like, totally awesome. 43 Gladiator 2000 When in Rome... stage one of the most exciting sword-and-sandals movies of all time.( Yes, we know that Ridley Scott 's epic vengeance yarn was actually filmed in England, Morocco, and Malta.) As Maximus, Russell Crowe is n't just macho -- he makes masculinity mythically cool. 44 The Player 1992 After a slump in the ' 80s, Robert Altman returned to his former glory with this searching Hollywood satire. Marked by his trademark restless camera work and peppered with sharp characterizations from his greatest( and most star-studded) ensemble since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earns a place next to his early masterworks. 45 Rain Man 1988 What 's missing from today 's movie scene? Major-studio crowd-pleasers like Rain Man -- artful, adult, humane dramas that win massive audiences and lots of Oscars. Dustin Hoffman plays autistic savant Raymond Babbitt as a sublime babble of Method tics. 46 Children of Men 2006 Maybe we 're just a bunch of film geeks, but those two amazing, single-shot action sequences -- the car chase in the woods and Clive Owen 's six-minute trek through a war zone -- are among the most amazing things we 've ever seen. 47 Men in Black 1997 Will Smith resumed his summer grudge against belligerent aliens with this hip, prankish, pure-popcorn adaptation of the cult comic-book series. It suceeds in large part because of Smith 's irascible chemistry with partner Tommy Lee Jones, and the result is a put-on blockbuster that unfolds like an intergalactic 48 HRS. 48 Scarface 1983 This Al Pacino-starring, Brian De Palma-directed, and Oliver Stone-penned gangster epic is a meditation on the dangers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. 49 Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon 2000 The first foreign-language film ever to gross more than $100 million in the U.S., Ang Lee 's epic updated the martial-arts genre with dazzling, gravity-defying fight sequences. 50 The Piano 1993 The closing five minutes -- when Holly Hunter 's mute pianist takes two trips to the bottom of the ocean, one real and one imaginary -- are enough on their own to earn Jane Campion 's bleak yet beautiful feminist parable a slot on our list. My Top 10 Jodie Foster New Classic Near-Death Experiences 1. Holly Hunter, The Piano( 1993) She sinks passively and wordlessly into the water and finally realizes with one heartbreaking look, " I want to live. " 2. Jeff Bridges, Fearless( 1993) Who could ever forget that opening scene of Bridges wandering around in that perfectly silent field with no expression, no affect whatsoever.

Ed Harris trying to bring his wife back to life using mouth-to-mouth, pounding her chest, screaming at her, crying, anything until she finally takes a breath. 7. Tim Robbins, Jacob 's Ladder( 1990) That scene where he 's thrown in a bathtub full of ice and he finally sees his true life in front of him. 8. Uma Thurman, Pulp Fiction( 1994) The gasp that shook the world. 9. Evan Rachel Wood, The Life Before Her Eyes( 2008) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that one split second near death. 10.
