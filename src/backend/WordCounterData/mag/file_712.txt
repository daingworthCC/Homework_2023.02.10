4154441 culture in context # It takes two to commit the sin of adultery, but women often get more than their fair share of the blame # Some stories are told over and over because they never lose their relevance. Two thousand years ago John 's gospel told of a mob 's self-righteous condemnation of a woman caught in the act of adultery( 8:1-11). And in 1877 Leo Tolstoy 's Anna Karenina told the story of a young woman scorned by an aristocratic society that condemned her sexual sins while ignoring the infidelities of her male counterpart. # More than 135 years after the publication of Tolstoy 's novel, and thousands of years since the writing of John 's gospel, director Joe Wright and writer Tom Stoppard 's recent film version of Anna Karenina( Universal) still finds an attentive audience long after the aristocratic Russian society it critiques has disappeared. # Anna( Keira Knightley), Tolstoy 's tragic heroine, is a model wife, adoring mother, supportive sister and sister-in-law, and joyful friend. She is also a married woman madly in love with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to family and friends and sends her into unimaginable bliss and despondent terror. # Anna is part of the polite society that urges wives to forgive their husbands ' indiscretions. But the virtuous Anna ends up falling head over heels for the dashing Count Vronsky( Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who is similarly smitten when he first sees her. # Struggling to resist the infatuation that becomes an all-consuming obsession, Anna tries to keep Vronsky at bay and to hold onto her marriage and family. But their joint passion eventually shatters her marital vows and all the social canons of their community. # Once their affair is public, Anna is cast out from her home, family, and society. She faces an implacable wall of judgment and silence, while her lover is free to carry on as if nothing has happened. The passion that fused Anna 's soul to Vronsky makes her an exile and dooms her to destruction. But, in a society where husbands and fathers make the rules, this affair leaves her beloved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have us learn two lessons from their tales of women caught as adulterers. The first is that we should be very careful about rushing to judgment about other people 's sins--especially sexual ones. # In both the gospel account and the latest film portrayal of Tolstoy 's novel, the truly malicious crime is not the sexual indiscretion of the women identified for punishment. John 's mob of people ready to stone the adulterous woman to death and Tolstoy 's pretentious Russian aristocracy are eager to condemn the failings of others and to rant against these public scandals. Each of the storytellers, however, is more scandalized by the rage and violence of these pious mobs and polite societies than by the sexual failings of any individual. # In John 8:7 Jesus punctures this righteous indignation by demanding that the one without sin cast the first stone, unmasking the mob 's hypocrisy by reminding them we are all sinners. In a similar fashion, Tolstoy reminds us of Anna 's humanity, a fragile and fallen humanity that we--and these angry mobs--share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # This cautionary tale warning us against self-righteous judgment can still be repeated today. Last year ended with a media feeding frenzy tracking the adulterous affair of ex-general and CIA director David Petraeus. Millions of us joined supposedly shocked pundits and politicians in expressing outrage at this immoral folly, though many of these same public figures( and a few of us) have their own skeletons. # And now we hear reports that Monica Lewinski hopes to make $12 million from a salacious memoir about her affair with Bill Clinton. Our neverending appetite for scandal allows us to judge others rather than to confess our own sins. # The second lesson found in the pages of John 's gospel and in Tolstoy 's tome deals with sexism, patriarchy, and the double standard applied to sexual sins. In John 's gospel the woman brought before Jesus has been found an adulterer and will be executed for her crime. There is no man anywhere to be found to receive the same punishment. In Anna Karenina Anna 's lover is granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " while she is condemned for violating social mores that forbid women the same liberty. # This double standard is still portrayed in many of today 's popular television shows. Viewers of AMC 's Mad Men savor the serial affairs of the adulterous Don Draper, who has slept with every attractive woman in the greater New York area without ever losing a job or commission. Meanwhile, over on PBS 's Downton Abbey, Lady Mary lived on the brink of ruin for two seasons because she failed to adequately resist a bachelor who came to her bedroom uninvited. # Both shows are historical pieces reflecting bygone times, but most contemporary viewers are still led to see Draper as heroic and Mary as tainted. Has nothing changed since the days of public stoning and haughty aristocracy? # Self-righteous hypocrisy is a passion stronger and more dangerous than sex, and the only antidote to this unruly appetite is compassion. # McCormick 's quick takes # Films that explore adulterous affairs : # Unfaithful( 20th Century Fox, 2002) # Walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up in the Air( Paramount, 2009) #
