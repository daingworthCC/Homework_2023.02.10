5008041 <h> iPhone 2020 Might Finally Have An All-New Design <p> According to TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo( via 9to5Mac), the 2020 iPhones will reportedly come with a major redesign. <p> In a new note to investors, Kuo says the coming year 's iPhones will have " an all-new form factor design " as well as " 5G support " and " camera function upgrades. " <p> He believes these three key upgrades will boost stagnating iPhone sales to new year-over-year growth. <p> Though Kuo did n't share details on what an " all-new form factor design " could mean, we 'd be down for an industrial design that 's similar to latest iPad Pros, which sport corners, flat sides, and a camera bump that does n't look completely terrible. <p> That said, it 's difficult to imagine Apple returning to an aluminum design for the body. Apple switched to glass starting with the iPhone 8 and iPhone X to enable wireless charging. Metal, as we already know, does n't play very nicely with wireless charging. And with Apple expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iPhone 11 Pro to charge up AirPods, it seems even more unlikely we 'll get a metal iPhone in 2020. <p> Still, a new form factor could mean many things. A smaller notch, in-display Touch ID, depth sensor on the rear for augmented reality, and USB-C port instead of Lightning are all features that are rumored for the 2020 iPhone. Apple is also expected to add 5G to next year 's iPhones. <p> Kuo previously claimed the 2020 iPhones would come in new screen sizes : 5.4 inch and 6.7 inch, to replace the current 5.8 inch and 6.5 inch displays. A 6.1-inch iPhone( most likely a third-generation iPhone XR) will remain in the lineup as well. <p> This year 's iPhone will be the third iteration of the iPhone X 's design, which came out in 2017. Though revolutionary at the time, smartphone makers quickly caught up and surpassed the iPhone X with even bolder edge-to-edge designs without notches.
