2040141 The Tombs of Ancient Peruvian Rulers Archaeologists are discovering that the Moche of northern Peru were the mastercraftsmen of ancient America <p> We were inside the tomb of a pre-Inca ruler. We had opened his coffin and carefully removed the upper levels of objects inside it. Then, near his head, we found multiple sets of necklaces, ear ornaments, and nose ornaments of gold and silver, piled one on top of another in a dazzling display of wealth and opulence. But the object that most captured my attention was what he was holding in his right hand -- a magnificent scepter of gold and silver. <p> The scepter had a trapezoidal, boxlike chamber, superbly crafted of sheet gold. In low relief was an elaborately garbed warrior thrusting his war club at the head of a captive. The rattle handle, made of solid silver, was decorated with military equipment : a conical helmet, a tunic, a circular shield, and armor. On the sides of the handle were war clubs with slings wrapped around them. The base of the handle flared slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and Peruvian archaeologist Walter Alva had been directing an excavation at Sipan, an archaeological site located in the lower Lambayeque valley, in northern Peru. I was visiting the site regularly to witness the uncovering of an extraordinary Moche tomb. As I stared at this rattle, I thought back to a time, more than ten years earlier, when I had seen the same rattle depicted in the ancient art of these people. It was associated with a ceremony in which prisoners of war were ritually sacrificed. The principal figure at the ceremony was a Warrior Priest, and the rattle was his property. Now we had excavated the tomb of an ancient ruler who was buried holding the rattle in his right hand. Could it be that he was the Warrior Priest? The possibility left me stunned. The correlation between depictions in ancient art and individuals buried in royal tombs was soon to have a profound effect on the way we viewed the Moche people of ancient Peru. <p> Moche civilization flourished on the north coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Human occupation in this desert environment is limited to a series of valleys whose rivers flow out of the Andes toward the Pacific shore. As in ancient Egypt, organic materials such as plant remains, textiles, basketry, leather, and even human bodies are often remarkably well preserved by arid climatic conditions. Consequently, there is abundant materials available today for archaeologists seeking a detailed reconstruction of these ancient societies. <p> The Moche were agriculturalists. They grew a wide variety of crops, including corn, beans, guava, avocados, squash, chiles, and peanuts. From the Pacific Ocean, as well as from rivers, marshes, and lagoons, they harvested a rich catch of fish, shrimp, crabs, crayfish, and mollusks. Domesticated llamas, guinea pigs, and ducks were additional sources of food, along with land mammals, birds, snails, and wild plants, which were occasionally hunted or gathered. <p> With an abundant and nutritious diet, the Moche sustained a dense, highly stratified population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, palaces, and temples. They also supported skilled artisans who produced objects of extraordinary artistic and technological sophistication. In clay, they brought animals, plants, anthropomorphic deities, and people to life, re-creating scenes of hunting and fishing, combat, and elaborate ceremonies. Moche metalworkers alloyed gold, silver, and copper in various combinations to create remarkable jewelry and ornaments that were worn by the elite. Their weavers created sumptuous textiles of cotton and wool, often decorated with complex depictions of people, plants, and animals. The Moche also carved and inlaid bone, wood, and stone ; pyro-engraved gourds ; and painted colorful murals on the walls of their religious structures. <p> In all, thousands of examples of Moche art have survived through the centuries. Thus, although the Moche had no writing system, they left a vivid artistic record of their activities, environment, and supernatural realm that provide present-day researchers with tantalizing views of Moche life. When archaeologists combine this extraordinary artistic record with what can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are able to develop remarkable insights about this pre-Inca civilization. <p> The key to working with Moche art has been to photograph objects in museums and private collections throughout the world. In the Moche Archive, located on the campus of the University of California in Los Angeles( UCLA), we now have more than 135,000 photographs of such objects, all organized by subject matter. Photographs of objects depicting deer hunting, for example, are kept together, as are those of objects depicting architecture, warfare, and distinct ceremonies. This archive serves as an important resource for the study of Moche culture. <p> In 1972 we learned that one of the activities frequently illustrated in Moche art was a ceremony in which prisoners of war were sacrificed, and their blood was consumed in tall goblets. Although the people and objects that characterize this ceremony are standard, there is considerable variation in the ways Moche artists combined them. Some representations show only a single element ; others involve various combinations of multiple elements. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below. The principal priests are shown in the upper part of this scene. Most important is the Warrior Priest, who holds a tall goblet. Rays project from his head and shoulders, and he wears a conical helmet with a crescent-shaped ornament at its peak, a crescent-shaped nose ornament, and large, circular ear ornaments. He also wears a warrior 's backflap, a large piece of metal armor that hangs from the back of his belt. To the right of the Warrior Priest is the Bird Priest. He is always part bird and part human, and is always shown wearing either a conical helmet( as in this representation) or a headdress with an owl at its center. To the right of the Bird Priest is the Priestess, a woman who always wears a long dress and a headdress with two prominent plumes. Her braided hair hangs down over her chest. <p> On the right in the lower register of this scene are two prisoners. Their clothing and weapons have been removed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are tied behind their backs, and their throats are being cut by captors who stand to one side. To the left of the prisoners is a litter with rays projecting from its backrest. This is the litter of the Warrior Priest, who is seen in the register above. There is a feline in front of the seat, and above the feline, tied to the litter with a cord, is the Warrior Priest 's scepter. It is shown horizontally, with its boxlike chamber on the left and its spatula-bladed handle on the right. <p> When we first identified the Sacrifice Ceremony in Moche art, we wondered if it was actually enacted by the Moche, or if it was a mythical event. The figures that were part human and part bird, or part human and part animal certainly seemed mythical, but perhaps these were artistic means to imply supernatural aspects of real people who were enacting the prescribed roles. Could it be that the Moche actually sacrificed prisoners of war and consumed their blood? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the royal tomb at Sipan, that we learned that these individuals and the Sacrifice Ceremony were indeed real. <p> Sipan is a small village, located in the central part of the Reque River valley. Near Sipan is an impressive cluster of mud-brick pyramids that rise dramatically out of the intensively cultivated valley floor. In February 1987 local grave robbers digging at the pyramids in search of ancient objects to sell, broke into one of the richest funerary chambers ever found -- the royal tomb of an ancient Moche ruler. <p> As the looters proceeded to sell the treasures, many of the ornaments were taken apart and sold piecemeal. Some of the objects were purchased by Peruvian collectors, while others were illegally smuggled out of Peru and sold in Europe, Japan, and the United States. Within months, the tomb contents were so widely dispersed that there was little hope of reconstructing an inventory of what the looters had found. <p> Soon, Walter Alva learned of the tomb. Director of the Bruning Archaeological Museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a team of archaeologists and began excavating at the pyramids. <p> In most areas they found only a hard matrix of mud bricks that had been mortared in place as the pyramid was constructed. In one area near the summit, however, they found a place where the bricks had been removed and subsequently replaced with soil centuries ago. As they began removing the soil, they found eight decomposed wood beams that roofed a small room approximately thirteen feet square. In the center of this room was a large coffin made of wood planks that had been tied together with copper straps. <p> Inside the coffin was layer upon layer of sumptuous grave offerings -- multiple sets of gold and silver jewelry, some exquisitely inlaid with turquoise. Among them were objects identical to those worn by the Warrior Priest -- near the ruler 's face were two crescent-shaped gold nose ornaments, and at the sides of his head were three pairs of exquisite gold and turquoise ear ornaments. Immediately beneath his body was a crescent-shaped gold headdress ornament, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of gold and one of silver. Each of these objects was precisely the size and form of those worn by the Warrior Priest. But the most important object was the scepter he held in his right hand. Its boxlike chamber and spatula-bladed handle were identical to those on the scepter that we had learned to recognize in Moche art as the property of the Warrior Priest. <p> As Alva 's excavation at Sipan continued in 1988 and 1989, another rich tomb was also discovered. It was similar to the one containing the Warrior Priest, although somewhat smaller in overall dimensions and with considerably fewer grave contents. These features imply that the tomb contained a person of lower status than the Warrior Priest. But who was he? <p> The contents of his coffin suggest that he may have been the Bird Warrior of the Sacrifice Ceremony. The large owl headdress found in his coffin is similar to the owl headdress frequently worn by the Bird Warrior. He also had a warrior 's backflap in his coffin, similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The two tombs at Sipan thus provided an extraordinary correlation between ancient artifacts and objects depicted in Moche art. Moreover, the artifacts held the key to identifying the status and rank of the buried individuals and the role they played in the ceremonial life of their people. <p> It was just a few years later, in 1991, that Peruvian archaeologist Luis Jaime Castillo and I began our excavation at San Jose de Moro, approximately sixty miles south of Sipan. A small village today, San Jose de Moro was an important ceremonial center in ancient times, with many pyramids and other religious structures. <p> During our first field season, we excavated a large chamber tomb similar to those of the Warrior Priest and the Bird Priest at Sipan. Located twenty-three feet underground, it contained multiple individuals and a wealth of funerary offerings. The principal individual in one of the tombs was an adult female. To our amazement, she was buried with objects that identified her as the Priestess of the Sacrifice Ceremony. She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sacrifice Ceremony, and two large metal plumes, identical to those that the Priestess wears in her headdress. Moreover, in one corner of her tomb was a large blackware ceramic basin containing cups and a Sacrifice Ceremony goblet. An identical basin with cups is shown associated with the Priestess in the Moche mural from the site of Panamarca, a ceremonial center located in the Nepena valley. Finding the plumes, goblets, basin, and cups in this woman 's tomb clearly identifies her as the Priestess of the Sacrifice Ceremony. <p> In 1992 we returned to San Jose de Moro and excavated another deep chamber tomb, almost identical to the one found the previous year. The principal individual in the tomb was once again an adult female, buried with two large headdress plumes and a copper goblet -- precisely what she would have needed to dress in and perform the role of the Priestess of the Sacrifice Ceremony. <p> It will be years before the entire contents of the royal tombs at Sipan and San Jose de Moro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, they have already provided a remarkable amount of information, which has fundamentally altered our perception of Moche civilization. <p> One of the most important insights gained from these tombs is that the pinnacle of Moche society soared much higher than we had imagined. No Moche burials previously excavated were as large and complex as these tombs, with room-sized burial chambers containing multiple individuals in separate coffins, surrounded by hundreds of ceramic vessels. Nor had any Moche tombs contained anywhere near the quantity and quality of jewelry and ornaments that were found in these royal tombs. <p> The most remarkable aspect of these tombs, however, is that the objects buried with the principal individuals have allowed us to identify them as participants in the Sacrifice Ceremony. When these individuals were first identified in the Moche Archive at UCLA in 1972, we did n't know if they were real or mythical, and we certainly never imagined that we would one day witness the excavation of their tombs. We now know that the Sacrifice Ceremony was a real event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depicted in Moche art. <p> The two tombs at Sipan date to approximately A. D. 300, and those at San Jose de Moro at least four hundred years later -- sometime after A. D. 700. This demonstrates that the Sacrifice Ceremony had a long duration in Moche culture, with individuals consistently dressing in the same traditional garments, ornaments, and headdresses. The ceremony was also widespread geographically. The Panamarca mural was found in the southern part of the Moche kingdom, more than 185 miles south of Sipan. Perhaps each of the river valleys that made up the Moche kingdom also had a central ceremonial precinct where the Sacrifice Ceremony was enacted. <p> Widespread in both time and space, the Sacrifice Ceremony was probably part of a state religion, with a priesthood in each part of the kingdom comprising individuals who dressed in prescribed ritual attire. When members of the priesthood died, they were buried at the temple where the Sacrifice Ceremony took place, wearing the objects they had used to perform the ritual. Subsequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, to dress like them, and to perform the same ceremonial role. <p> Thus the royal tombs of Sipan and San Jose de Moro have provided important new insights into the nature of Moche culture. They have given us a much clearer understanding of Moche social organization, which had a wealthier class of nobles than we had ever imagined. The burial of these nobles, with multiple sets of sumptuous clothing and ornaments, would have created the need to support a large number of highly skilled artisans to replenish the material that was being removed by royal burial. This, in turn, has helped explain the extraordinary artistic and technological achievements of the Moche, who were truly the mastercraftsmen of ancient America. <p> The contents of these royal tombs provide a dramatic contrast to the contents of looted tombs, the remains of which are now divided and scattered in private collections throughout the world, unavailable for scholarly research or public viewing. Instead, the artifacts of Sipan and San Jose de Moro will be kept together, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and appreciate. Although the treasures found in these wondrous tombs seem priceless, of perhaps greater value are the extraordinary tales they tell, which are helping us to assemble a clearer and more accurate picture of the Moche -- one of the most remarkable civilizations of the ancient world. <p> <p> MAP : Northern coast of Peru <p> PHOTOS : An artist 's rendering of the Sacrifice Ceremony, left ; objects of unequaled beauty such as these turquiose and gold earrings, top, have been found in the royal tombs along the northern coast of Peru <p> PHOTOSS : A diagram of the tomb of the Warrior Priest, above, shows layers of funerary objects ; the spatula-bladed gold scepter, right, found in the tomb ; a peanut-shaped necklace of gold and silver, top <p> PHOTOS : The Panamarca mural, above, helped to identify the Priestess of the Sacrifice Ceremony ; as the digging of the royal tombs continues, top right, it will be years before the artistic legacy of the Moche is fully understood <p> BY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anthropology and the director of the Fowler Museum of Cultural History at UCLA. <p> THE ROYAL TOMBS OF <p> Many of the treasures described on these pages are currently on view in a traveling exhibition entitled The Royal Tombs of Sipan.
