Let 's assume the new space vision proceeds apace and that construction of the International Space Station is completed around 2010. Let 's say that NASA and its international partners then continue to operate the station for another seven years, as planned, using it mainly for human physiology experiments that investigate how we might handle extended interplanetary exploration. Meanwhile, of course, we 'll have developed a new Crew Exploration Vehicle ; heck, for the sake of argument, let 's say we 've even started dispatching robotic freighters to stock a site near the Moon 's south pole for a permanent base. It 's 2017, and it 's time to turn our attention resolutely toward manned trips to the Moon -- and, beyond, to Mars. It 's time( past time, many critics would say) to dump the ISS. What then? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elephant into the world 's most exclusive hotel. The ISS, after all, is n't an extraordinarily successful, irreplaceably valuable space telescope like the Hubble ; you ca n't just discard it. Even in 13 years, it 'll still be blessed with immense **27;3311;TOOLONG capabilities, high-volume data links and extensive collections of scientific instruments -- not to mention that golden attribute of all desirable real estate : location, location, location. This thing is an asset. Yet it 's doubtful that NASA, even with pressure from its European and other space partners, will have the stomach or the budget to extend the station 's life past its 2017 expiration date. Hence the hotel idea -- sell or lease the ISS to a gazillionaire, perhaps a Paul Allen, a Russian oligarch or a megacorporation with enough capital to finance the project. Citizen stays on the ISS are nothing new, of course. Later this year or early next, an as yet unidentified American physicist will become the third space tourist to pay $20 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not talking about enabling the fantasies of glorified stowaways, however abundantly wealthy. We 're talking about converting the station from a sparse research lab into an entertainment center, complete with activities and amenities that are suitable for the discerning traveler and that maximize the touristic potential of weightlessness, and then throwing open the airlock doors to anyone with enough cash to pay for a stay. Even this plan is not wholly original. Proposals for independent space hotels pop up all the time( see " Spin City, " opposite), and a dedicated hotel in low Earth orbit, whether it 's a retrofitted space station or not, is the obvious extension of the business plan for space-tourism outfits like ISS tour broker Space Adventures, and even for the teams competing for the X Prize, which goes to the first private effort to launch a three-person spacecraft to an altitude of 62.5 miles and repeat the feat within two weeks. But we are the first to commission a drool-worthy, photo-real proof-of-concept depiction of a tourism-optimized space station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the financial and logistical reality check, to see what the bill would be and how the hotelnauts would get there and back. Skeptics might object that the timetable and other assumptions laid out at the beginning of this article( derived from the Bush space plan) are optimistic. They are. But if those assumptions are n't realized, the chorus for unloading the station even earlier will only grow louder. NASA will, sooner or later, having poured in more or less money, endeavor to forfeit its stake in the station. Here, then, is how the hotel scenario would work : A private consortium of some sort -- working in cooperation with the Russian, European and Japanese space agencies -- takes a long-term lease and invests in a major rehab( the Japanese and European research labs will continue to be used for research by a small team of scientists, assisted by inquisitive tourists). The consortium guts many of the existing American and Russian modules and adds a few new ones, including a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also includes external screens for advertising, along with dedicated cameras inside and out for shooting space-based reality shows, all of which requires multiple flights on a spacecraft big enough to carry significant payloads to orbit. This brings us to our biggest hurdle : transportation. Today, the only spacecraft capable of transporting both passengers and modules to the ISS is the aging space shuttle, which costs $500 million per launch and is scheduled for decommission by 2010. The 1960s-vintage Russian Soyuz, currently the only other spacecraft that can transport people to the station, can hold either three astronauts or a limited amount of cargo, but not both. But solutions are on the way. Russia recently announced its plan to build a vehicle called Kliper, which evolved from a concept first proposed about 15 years ago. Kliper would be able to carry as many as six people up to the ISS. At the same time, the Chinese are planning more flights of their Shenzhou vehicle, an advanced version of the Soyuz. And then there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future generations of the winning X Prize craft will soar high enough to reach low Earth orbit, and it would be silly not to design them to link up to Hotel Alpha, as we have dubbed our ISS resort. Whichever option emerges as the optimal ISS passenger-and-payload ferry will need to have a per-launch cost of around $10 million, or about one-fiftieth that of a space shuttle flight today. This is a back-of-the-envelope projection of annual operating costs : $100 million paid to Russian Mission Control for ground support ; $300 million to NASA for ground support, including fabrication of spare parts for maintenance, as necessary ; $50 million for additional logistics support ; $50 million for supplies, payroll and other miscellaneous expenses. Add the cost of the launches -- approximately 20 per year -- and space hotel expenditures will total $700 million a year. How does the revenue stack up? Figure, conservatively, 60 paying customers at $12 million per week, for a total of $720 million. Then add in profits from station-related advertising and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the station 's immense power-generation capabilities, the ISS will be able to beam its surplus energy via microwave antennas to satellites in geosynchronous orbit. All told, the station could easily gross around $900 million a year, creating $200 million in annual profits for investors daring enough to transform it. What makes an ISS vacation worth the $12 million price tag? At root is the " because it 's there " aspect : a thrilling journey, followed by bragging rights wrapped up in spectacular views. But once you 're there, the big attraction will be something no Earthbound destination can provide : sustained weightlessness. Visitors will float through their stays as they gaze out upon the 16 sunrises and sunsets per Earth day. Modules will be reconfigured for microgravity activities, like six-wall handball, or bouncing around inside a giant tubular trampoline, or " eagling, " in which visitors strap on wings and fly through a computer-generated environment depicting -- well, whatever they want. Passengers will also have the opportunity to sign up for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay attached to either the tram that runs up and down the station 's long external truss, or to a robot arm added to the station 's exterior. The consortium might even offer a once-per-stay space bungee jump, in which the space-suited guest is belayed out two miles on a tether for several hours of day-night planetary passes with nothing in sight but Earth and the cosmos, the station no bigger than a Matchbox car off in the distance. Even after remodeling, the Hotel Alpha will be better suited to the kind of adventure traveler who dreams of scaling Everest than to the pampered priss accustomed to room service. Guests wo n't be allowed to bring their own clothes, which could contaminate the sterile environment in the ISS with anything from cat dander to dry-cleaning chemicals. Nor will they be able to pack appliances : An ordinary alarm clock, for example, would fry aboard the ISS, because there are no convection currents to carry away air heated by the clock 's electronics. Every appliance built for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those fans add up to a noisy environment : 72 decibels on the ISS, about the level you hear on a freeway at 60 mph with the windows down. Another potentially disappointing reality : It will be extremely difficult, and potentially impossible, to earn charter membership in the 250-mile-high club. First, there 's the tricky matter of weightless motion ; coupling in such an environment might not be possible without a push from a third party( which is how some whales mate), or, at the very least, some well-placed handgrips. But more crucially, it 's possible that men will have difficulity maintaining erections in microgravity. Then again, some guests might have a hard time getting in the mood anyway, what with all the barfing going on. Roughly half of all space travelers have experienced some degree of nausea, most likely caused by fluid floating around in the inner ear, which signals the body that it 's in free fall. A Japanese journalist whose TV broadcasting company sent him to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing up. We 're confident that the unique attractions of a space hotel will more than compensate for the inevitable hardships, keeping Hotel Alpha profitable for years to come. This profit motive, let 's not forget, is the essential ingredient in our plan. From it will spring the opportunity to transform the ISS from a boondoggle into something that truly captures our Earthbound imaginations. " Looking back on it 20 or 30 years later, " says Eric Anderson, president of Space Adventures, " people might say one of the most unexpected yet important outcomes of the ISS was that it became a place for the rest of us to experience space.
