2025741 Section : PASTEL PAGE <p> Creating large-scale pastel paintings is one of my greatest pleasures. The medium offers a fantastic intensity of color as well as the potential for developing a wide range of textures. When working on supports that are larger than the standard-size papers available at local art-supply stores, I take special consideration in choosing the right paper, handling and applying the pastel, and framing the finished piece. CHOOSING THE RIGHT PAPER <p> The type of paper I use is crucial to a successful painting. Some time ago, I tried stretching watercolor paper and applying various coats of gesso and pumice to create texture. Unfortunately, when I blended the whites of a snowy landscape I was working on, I noticed them turning pink. The surface was so abrasive that it had caused my hand to start bleeding. I decided at that point that I really did not want to literally put myself into my paintings. Today, I purchase pastel paper in eight-yard rolls, measure and cut the size of the piece I need, and mount it on 1/8 " thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to have the pastel paper mounted on mat board, but I personally prefer the first method. My supplier, who does the mounting for me, uses only acid-free adhesives in a dry-mounting process and takes great care to prevent indentations on the board. <p> Generally, the paper I use has a warm-gray tone. I work on the smoother side. Since it 's mounted on Fome-Cor, the paper has a bit of spring to it when I apply pressure with the pastels. HANDLING AND APPLYING THE PASTEL <p> Thorough preparation is important when working on large surfaces. I stock my studio with a variety of pastels -- mostly Daler-Rowney and Sennelier -- and continually experiment with new products. <p> To begin, I make a very rough sketch in pastel, which I later draw over with India ink.( The ink sketch will show through the first layer of pastel.) After the ink is dry, I pick up the pastels again and work from the top of the paper to the bottom. This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to worry about contaminating it with falling dust. Sometimes I 'll use a fixative to build up an area 's tooth and then layer another color over it. However, I generally do not fix the finished painting. THOUGHTS ON FRAMING <p> Framing oversized works can be a major concern. In general, the largest glass size is about 36 " x 48 ", although some suppliers offer larger sheets. I try to keep this limitation in mind, but one great thing about working on paper mounted on Fome-Cor is that it does n't need a mat. Because it is sturdy I only need to put some spacers between the painting and the frame itself, so that the work is not touching the glass. As a final step before framing, I 'm always careful to tap the back of the board in order to get rid of any loose pieces of pastel. <p> My work is rendered in a realistic style, and I strive to evoke a mood or feeling.
