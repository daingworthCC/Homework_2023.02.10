The awards, now in their 21st year, are meant to highlight those apps that set a benchmark for high-quality design, taking into consideration things like the user interface and user experience, originality and other factors that represent those types of applications that Apple would like to see more of in its App Store. <p> Other app developers often look to the list of design award winners to get a sense of the type of apps and designs that Apple values. <p> This year, the award winners were an international crowd -- only one winner comes from the U.S., despite the U.S. being one of Apple 's largest markets. <p> The American award winner was also a bit unusual -- instead of being a consumer-facing app or game, it 's one built for the medical industry. <p> Agenda is a minimalist note-taking app for Mac and iOS that takes a unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to track the past, present and future of tasks at once. The app also includes beautifully styled notes and typography, along with well-thought-through navigational design elements, search and support for iCloud sync and Handoff. <p> What 's also interesting about Agenda is that its website highlights the standalone Mac app download. The Mac App Store download link is buried at the bottom of the page. <p> Bandimal is an adorably designed music composer for kids where animals are used in place of instruments.

While not a consumer-facing app, Triton Sponge has a very critical and even life-saving task to manage. And it does so with the use of iOS technologies including Core Image, camera Depth Map to detect the sponges, Core ML and machine learning to perform blood loss calculations. The app also is capable of detecting duplicate sponges, even if they 're held up in front of the camera in a different orientation. Triton Sponge is FDA approved and HIPAA compliant. <p> Florence is an interactive graphic novel from Monument Valley designer Ken Wong of Mountains, which is sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love and relationships.

It 's both beautiful and -- thanks to its soundtrack -- calming. Frost uses Metal technology to create its smooth animations, and takes advantage of other technologies like multi-touch. This is the second win for the team, which previously won for their game Blek. <p> Oddmar, four years in the making, is a hand-drawn Viking-themed side-scroller that looks almost like it could be a film instead of game. The story focuses on Oddmar, the main character, trying to redeem himself and be worthy of a place in Valhalla. The game is optimized for touch controls, supports game controllers, takes advantage of Metal and includes a soundtrack influenced by traditional Swedish music that was actually recorded in small studio in Sweden. <p> All the winners receive a solid aluminum trophy( pictured above) that lights up and a treasure trove of Apple swag, including a tricked out iMac Pro, iPad Pro, iPhone X @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Apple iOS App Store.
