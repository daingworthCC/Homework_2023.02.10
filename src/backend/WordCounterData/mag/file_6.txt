2001441 They combine most of the virtues of a scope with light weight and small size. Why are n't they more popular? Read on and find out. // IT 'S STRANGE BUT IT 'S TRUE. America is the world 's leader in technology and scientific innovation, but American shooters are as hidebound and stodgy a lot as you 'll find. It took decades for the average hunter to discover the advantages of telescopic rifle sights, and now the same slow process is going on with electronic sights. More 's the shame, because they can do some things better than any scope or iron sight. The typical electronic sight is less expensive than a telescopic sight of comparable quality. Its small size makes it less cumbersome than a regular scope and that, along with its lighter weight, has less effect on the handling and feel of a firearm. Then there is eye relief : Where the eye relief of all rifle and handgun scopes is quite limited, it is virtually unlimited in the electric sight. You can see the dot and the target whether your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've ever been pounded in the eyebrow by the ocular-lens bell of a scope, this will mean a great deal to you. FASTER THAN FAST Electronic sights are far easier for the beginning shooter to master than scopes or open sights. You simply plaster the big red dot where you want the bullet to go and squeeze the trigger. And finally, far-sighted shooters with eyes that absolutely refuse to focus on the front sight of a firearm will find the electronic sight to be a godsend since it does n't require the use of corrective-lens eyeglasses. And there 's more. The relatively narrow tube of a telescopic sight restricts the shooter 's field of view, but an electronic sight, properly used, has an unlimited field. You do n't look into it as you do a scope. You simply keep both eyes focused on the target and squeeze the trigger as the red dot settles where the bullet is supposed to go. And since most electronic sights are free of parallax, you 'll still hit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tube. Photograph For eyes that can no longer focus on the front sight of a handgun, a red-dot is the answer to a prayer, since it puts sight and target in the same optical plane. // All of this makes the electronic sight quicker than quick to use. Out to 25 yards or so, an experienced handgun shooter can centerpunch his target in well under a second, and that includes the time it takes him to react to the buzzer of an electronic timer, raise his gun, aim, and pull the trigger. WHERE THEY SHINE With the exception of Aimpoint 's 5000-2X model, electronic sights do n't magnify, so they 're best for shooting at targets no farther than 100 yards or so. This makes them ideal for close-range plinking, casual target shooting, and small-game hunting with.22 rimfire rifles and handguns. The electronic sight is an excellent choice for use on shortrange woods rifles such as the Winchester 94, Marlin 336, and Ruger 96/44. Same goes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Casull. In states and hunting areas where their use is not prohibited, electronic sights also work great on in-line muzzleloaders. Shotgunners of an experimental nature occasionally give red-dot sights a try at skeet, Sporting Clays, and wingshooting, but they have n't really caught on, and I 'll be surprised if they ever do, because they 're designed for aiming, not for pointing. However, you who hunt big game with shotguns and slug loads will find the red-dot sight to be just the ticket for bringing home the venison. But it 's on a turkey gun that the red-dot sight really shines. Anyone who has patterned a few shotguns knows that it 's not uncommon to see a shotgun throw the main part of its charge somewhere other than where you 're aiming. But an electric sight enables you to zero your shotgun just as you would a rifle, and once that 's done the gun will throw the center off its pattern precisely where the red dot shines. BATTERY ANXIETY I 'd guess that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they depend on batteries. They visualize themselves aiming at the trophy of a lifetime and, without warning, the red dot suddenly shuts off. Wo n't happen. For one thing, battery life for most sights is far longer than most hunts, even if the dot is allowed to burn 24 hours per day for the entire hunt. And besides, the dot does n't suddenly switch off as the battery grows weak. It grows noticeably dimmer, which is your cue to put in a fresh battery, which you had the foresight to keep in your daypack. Most electric sights are rated as water-resistant, with very few rated as waterproof. Even so, I 've hunted in Alaska with a water-resistant sight when it rained all the time, and it came through with flying colors. All I did was keep it covered with my raincoat. Mounting an electric sight is no more trouble than mounting a scope. You have to be able to read the directions and use a screwdriver. Bear in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bases that will not let the sight slip, and that some rings and bases are stronger than others. I suggest that when you purchase your mounting system, you get it from a dealer who 's had experience with serious handguns. To paraphrase the old adver rising slogan, red dots mean sure shots. Give one a try. <p>
