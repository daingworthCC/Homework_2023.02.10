A perfect backswing does n't do you any good if you ca n't catch the ball flush. When I practice, contact is my feedback, not what my swing looks like. # TRY THIS From the top of your downswing, pull your left hand down without letting out the hinge in your wrists. As your hands swing in front of your body, begin turning the right side of your body " through " the ball. This is the most reliable way to make sure that your hands are ahead of the clubface when it strikes the ballthe secret to crushing your irons. # To check if you 're doing it correctly, hit iron shots from a practice bunker. If you pull and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand, and the shot will carry close to its full distance. If the ball comes up short, you 're either pulling too hard or not rotating enough. Pulling is a steepening move, while rotating is a shallowing one. You need both to catch shots crisp. # IRON COMBO # From the top of your backswing, pull the club down with your left hand, then rotate the right side of your body as you swing through impact. # HALVE YOUR HANDICAP # by taking a divot in front of the ball # Billy 's rightcorrect iron impact is a blend of pulling your left hand down and rotating your body, brushing the grass in the process. I 'll add that the brush must occur in front of the ball. This is evidence that you 're contacting the ball cleanly. My advice? Draw a line on the range( spray paint works) perpendicular to your target line. Place a ball on the line and swing. Your goal is to brush the grass( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line, not on or behind it. This kind of feedback is criticalyou 'll know instantly if you 're improving or need more work. Mike Adams # DRILL : DIVOT LINE # Look for the video in the 30-Day Improvement Plan on Golf.com/golf-tips # APPROACH-SHOT IMPROVEMENT PLAN # I 'll take you from an iron-play zero to hero by helping you # Find your natural backswing shape # Nail your ideal top position # Demystify the role that your lower body plays # Create centered, square contact # Take a divot in front of the ball # DRIVING # You do n't have to swing harder to drive the ball farther. " Load and separate, " like I do, and watch your clubhead speed spike. # I 've actually picked up a few yards of driving distance this season, and my average of 294.6 yards is the highest of my career. But swinging faster is the furthest thing from my mind. In a way, speed happens by itselfit 's a natural result of improved, efficient mechanics. # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " On your backswing, focus on shifting your weight into your right hip. You should feel some tension in your right glute as you " load up. " Once you reach the top, move your left hip toward the targetjust the left hipgetting it as far away from your left shoulder as possible. That 's the separation part, which creates even more tension in your right side. Guess what? That tension is speed just waiting to happen. After you separate, unwind everything. You 'll feel faster than ever, and a lot more powerful. # BILLY SAYS BEWARE! # The big mistake in driving is moving your left hip and shoulder at the same time at the start of your downswing, an energy drain that eliminates the whip in your motion and makes you use your arms to generate swing speed. # LOAD # As you swing back, shift weight onto your right side, " loading " up your right glute. The tension you feel in your rear end is swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bump " your left hip toward the target without moving your left shoulder. This doubles the tension created in your backswing, letting you whip the club through the ball as you unwind. # HALVE YOUR HANDICAP # by increasing your backswing rotation # Tour players like Billy Horschel tend to turn their shoulders back while keeping their hips stable, maximizing torque. Weekend players need all the turn they can get. Try hitting drives with your right foot pulled back at address. The right-foot back position lets you make a much bigger turn( using both your shoulders and hips) and create more energy in your swing. When you pair this bigger turn with the way Billy separates his left hip from his left shoulder at the start of the downswing, you 'll start bombing it the way he does. Mark Hackett # DRILL : RIGHT FOOT BACK # Look for the video in the 30-Day Improvement Plan on Golf.com/golf-tips # DRIVING IMPROVEMENT PLAN # The secret to hitting every drive longer and straighter? My 5 keys : # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your body # Groove an ascending angle of attack # Narrow your starting line # Pour on the swing speed # SHORT-GAME SHOTS # At impact, align the shaft and your hands to activate the bounce on your wedgesand slide through any chip or pitch with ease # You often hear Tour players say how important it is to " use the bounce " on short-game shots. They 're correct. The bouncethe curved part of the sole that " lifts " the leading edge above the ground when the shaft is straight up and downallows you to slide the club under the ball without it digging into the turf, whether you 're chipping, pitching or blasting out of a bunker. # TRY THIS Regardless of the short-game shot you 're hitting, let your hands rotate slightly to the right as you swing back, opening the face just a few degrees. That " activates " the bounce. On your downswing, refrain from pulling hard with your left handthe opposite of what you should do when hitting an iron. Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slide the club under the ball, clipping it off the grass. Do it correctly and your hands and the clubhead will reach impact at the same time, with the shaft straight up and down. Perfect! # SWEET RELEASE # To hit crisp short-game shots, release the club with your right hand on your downswing. You 'll know you did it right if the shaft is straight up and down and in line with your hands at impact. # NO! # Closed clubface on the backswing. The leading edge will dig into the turf. # YES! # Opened clubface on the backswing. Exposed bounce lets the club slide under the ball. # HALVE YOUR HANDICAP # by setting up " neutral " on chips and pitches # Billy has some great thoughts on how to activate the bounce on your wedges when hitting shots around the greens. I think it 's even easier if you activate it at setup. My advice? Take a shoulder-width stance, stand " tall " and position the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands in front of your zipper. Do n't make the duffer 's mistake and lean the shaft forwardthat just encourages a dig. Set up neutral and, like Billy says, return to neutral. You 'll catch your chips and pitches cleaner than ever. Scott Munroe # DRILL : BOUNCE ACTIVATION # Look for the video in the 30-Day Improvement Plan on Golf.com/golf-tips # SHORT-GAME IMPROVEMENT PLAN # You 'll save par from anywhere after I # Teach you how to vary trajectory # Show you how to dial in your pitch-shot distances # Explain how to master the flop shot # Unveil the secrets to knocking any bunker shot tight to the pin # PUTTING # Reading the line? Overrated! Instead, focus on how hard you want to hit the ball, then simply choose a line that matches the speed. # Let me share a secret that every Tour pro knows : You can hole putts using a variety of speeds. Yep, you have options. You can coax it in, letting the ball slowly drop in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trace a beeline to the cup. Or you can choose a pace somewhere between those two extremes. My putting process is pretty simpleI choose my desired speed and pick a line that matches that speed. This engages my sense of feel, and it works. I 've ranked in the top tier in Strokes Gained Putting since getting my Tour card in 2010. # TRY THIS Use my two-step practice routine( which is also a great pre-round warmup). First, hole several straight three-footers to confirm that you 're aligned and aiming correctly. Then work on your speedtake four tees, peg them 10, 20, 30 and 40 feet away, and try to roll one ball to each distance. With your mechanics( step 1) and your sense of feel( step 2) locked in, you 'll be loose and focused on the course. # GET A FEEL FOR DISTANCE # Roll the ball different distances between 10 and 40 feet during practice or before teeing off. This heightens your feel for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distances. On the course, they simply react to what they see. # MATCH LINE WITH SPEED # Decide how fast or slow you want to hit your putt, then pick a line based on that speed. This lets you hole putts without finding the perfect line or hitting a specific spot, tough tasks even for pros. # HALVE YOUR HANDICAP # by " locking " your lower body in place # Players of Billy 's caliber spend a lot of time working on speed because their fundamentals are already rock solid. Your basics may need a tune-up. A big mistake I see among recreational golfers? Too much body action. Extra leg movement and hip turn can throw the putter off the ideal path, so even smooth strokes miss. Make like vintage Arnold Palmer and putt with your toes turned in. This locks your hips and knees in place, stabilizing your stroke, and will help you start the ball dead on line, no matter the break. Kellie Stenzel # DRILL : ARNOLD PALMER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plan on Golf.com/golf-tips # PUTTING IMPROVEMENT PLAN # You 'll be the Boss of the Moss in 30 days and learn to # Start every putt on line # Improve your contact # Make your stroke a pendulum # Hone a calibrated stroke to roll the ball any distance # BODY MECHANICS # Hit every club in your bag longer! Make your swing faster, more efficient and easy to repeat using a few simple stretches. # I 'm adamant about keeping my body in peak condition, but I do n't go crazy and pump a lot of iron like some other guys on Tour do. To me, everyday flexibility is more important than big muscles. If you feel tight one day, loose the next, and tighter the day after that, it 's impossible to re-create the same swing each time. This helps explain why your motion can feel so different from one round to the next. # TRY THIS Lie down on your back, tilt your knees to the right and stretch your left arm to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the big muscles in your back( hello, power) and helps you disassociate your upper body from your lower. What that means is that you can turn your shoulders without turning your hips( and vice versa), which is key for creating coil energy on your backswing and " separating " your left hip from your left shoulder on your downswing. Perform this stretch for a few minutes every day in both directions. I 'll bet after two weeks you 'll hit the ball at least five yards farther. # FLEX APPEAL # Increase your flexibility and range of motion to improve your swing overnight. I lie on the floor and stretch my upper body and lower body in different directions. # HALVE YOUR HANDICAP # by increasing your overall range of motion # Increasing your flexibility pays huge dividends. As part of Golf Magazine 's " Halve Your Handicap " plan, I provide a number of Tour-proven, performance-boosting stretches. I 'll also show you how to test your range of motion to pinpoint nagging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across your chest as shown and turn your torso to the right without moving your hips.
