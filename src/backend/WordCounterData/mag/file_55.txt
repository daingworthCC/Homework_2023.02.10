2006941 Long before architect Robert Epps began work on this Charleston single house, the property had earned a rich history. It was built in 1730 for Thomas Bee, a notable figure in the colonial government and a leader of the American Revolution. In the mid-1800s the house became a player in the march toward the Civil War when Nullification Documents were signed in the library. In more recent times, the house underwent several alterations, including the addition of ornate moldings, the enclosing of an upstairs porch, and the construction of a masonry structure connecting the main residence with a service building behind. These modifications masked the original simplicity and elegance of the residence. Robert addressed all of these problems in the final project, but the process began with a more modest endeavor : The owners wanted to modernize the cramped kitchen. In the domino effect that touches many remodeling jobs, enhancing the kitchen sparked ideas of improving adjoining areas. Such plans led to opening the space and creating a stronger relationship with the outside. While restoration work in the historic main residence was done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a separation between the main house and the service building. The space provided by the connection is too valuable. Instead, the remodeled section was designed to be clearly distinguishable as contemporary, thereby creating a sense of visual separation. " I like to mix old and new things in anticipation that they both will be appreciated more in contrast, " Robert says. This is not to say that the new does n't take a few cues from the old. Marble flooring in the kitchen and sitting area, for example, coordinates with the grayand-white floor of the adjacent loggia. Similarly, Robert designed the steeland-glass structure to echo, not strictly match, the proportions of traditional, double-hung windows. // <p>
