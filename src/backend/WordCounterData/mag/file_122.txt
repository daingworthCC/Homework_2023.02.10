2015241 Dear Dr. Cory : We have dogs. Is it all right or bad for them to eat chocolate? Hilary Burgin and Mackenzie Bartlett Acton, Massachusetts Dear Hilary and Mackenzie : There is a chemical in chocolate called theobromine. Unlike humans, dogs are unable to metabolize, or break down, this chemical in their body. Instead it acts like a poison to their system. It can cause problems to their digestive, nervous, heart, and circulatory systems.These problems can give the dog symptoms like vomiting, diarrhea, nervousness, muscle twitching, and seizures. Deaths have also been reported. Pets are like young children.They ca n't protect themselves from dangers. So protect your pet from anything that you think might harm him, including chocolate. Dear Dr. Cory : At night it has been hard to breathe, even when I lie down. But I did n't start having this problem until I came out to California for the summer to visit relatives. Do you think I 'm homesick? // Sarah Clark Bakersfield, California Dear Sarah : Have you ever been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cough and a more difficult time breathing at night. Were you around things in California that you are not normally around at home in Oklahoma, such as a cat or cigarette smoke? Sometimes these things can bring on, or trigger, an asthma attack.The air quality where you are in California may be different from your home. Air pollution can also trigger asthma attacks. If you continue to have trouble breathing at night, you need to be evaluated by your family physician. Did you know? The average 12-ounce can of soda pop contains about 40 grams of refined sugars. That 's 10 teaspoons of pure calories.Would you ever eat 10 teaspoons of sugar at once? The Center for Science in the Public Interest is worried about the nutrition of all kids, and so are we. Coca-Cola is the exclusive global sponsor for the movie, " Harry Potter and the Sorceror 's Stone. " " In much of the world, child obesity rates have been increasing. At the same time, consumption by children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploding, while milk intake is declining " // Barry Popkins, Professor of Nutrition, University of North Carolina School of Public Health From Concerned Kids " I am disappointed that Harry Potter, which was so good for the growth of the mind, is now being used to sell a product which is not good for the growth of the body. Colas have no nutrients, and they take the place of nutritious drinks like juice or milk.They do nothing to make you stronger or healthier.Why encourage us to do something which is n't good for us? " Kaira S., age 10, competitive swimmer Providence, Rhode Island " You must agree that Harry Potter books are superb, and you do get lost in the books. So many children think so that never liked to read before. So now that J.K. Bowling is influencing them to read, she is influencing them to drink Coca-Cola, when children should be drinking milk or some more nutritive drink. Girls are more at risk than anyone else at getting osteoporosisand J.K. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age 10, junior Olympian In aerobics Rehoboth, Mississippi For more information or to get involved, visit this Web site : saveharry@cspinet.org.
