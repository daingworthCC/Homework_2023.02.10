2028241 // JERRY FALWELL may have apologized for asserting that God has lifted " His protective hand " from America because gays and lesbians, abortionists and liberal advocacy groups " have tried to secularize America "( News, Sept. 26-Oct. 3). But does contrition signal that his view of God 's character has changed? Falwell 's God of vengeance has repeatedly whipped him into frenzies of condemnation and judgment. In this, Falwell 's God differs only in degree but not in kind from the God of Osama bin Laden, who interpreted the horrific events of September 11 as " retribution from God. " Is it truly in God 's character to " tramp out grapes of wrath "? Or shall we turn to the common witness of Judaism, Islam and Christianity, to a God of justice and mercy, " slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love "? These opposing views can not be reconciled. The character of God matters. Craig Anderson Brookside Community Church, Brookside, N.J. Words of appreciation.. I HAVE ALWAYS liked your work, but the September 26-October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the events of September 11 were as helpful and thoughtful as any I have seen, and better than most. I am particularly struck that you took the time and space to include eyewitness accounts as well as the excellent opening editorial, the everthoughtful words of Barbara Brown Taylor, the very useful items by Jon Gunnemann, Gilbert Meilaender and Trudy Bush, and of course James Wall and Martin Marty. Rob Elder First Presbyterian Church, Salem, Ore. As a subscriber since seminary days, I have found the CHRISTIAN CENTURY to be interesting and provocative reading. But I have found it to be absolutely essential reading in the past few weeks. As I struggled to say something comforting and challenging -- as well as theologically sound-to my people in recent weeks, I welcomed the arrival of my CENTURY as never before. In particular, the entire " In the face of evil " issue( Sept. 26-Oct. 3), John Buchanan 's " To think and act anew "( Oct. 10) and the editorial " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been greatly helpful. Thank you. Rebekah Simon-Peter First United Methodist Church, Rawlins, Wyo. Martin Marty recognizes the " people whose year-in, year-out steadfastness " pays the bills and keeps the church doors open for times like these, and who keep alive the " vocabulary of prayer " and the " stories that give meaning "( " America at prayer, " Sept. 26-Oct. 3). While we in the local church appreciate Marty 's thoughts, they also fit him, you and all the people who work at your fine magazine. Because you all faithfully attend to your duty in times when there is no particular crisis to speak of, you were in position to publish an extraordinary issue about the terrorist attacks. Just when many ministers like myself were out of words to articulate both our feelings and our faith, the CENTURY arrived, promising depth with its somber cover and its title, " In the face of evil. " I found refreshment, insight and energy to rejoin the challenge of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church, Anchorage, Ky. Training pastors... PIVOTAL LEADERSHIP, " by L. Gregory Jones and Susan Pendleton Jones( Sept. 12-19), is unfairly written and full of generalities. The authors take little or no account of the great emphasis on pastoral care in congregations and seminaries for the last 80 years. The authors lift up an " inappropriate " response in a prison setting by a chaplain described in Sister Helen Prejean 's Dead Man Walking. Many pastors, including me, have been extensively trained in pastoral care and CPE. I wish the authors would give credit to those who offer support and guidance to persons suffering from loss and stress after the event of September 11. I wish they would give credit to pastors who move beyond the local congregations to participate in community vigils, Holocaust interfaith commemorations, and feeding and homeless programs. The authors throw around terms like " spiritual life, " " pastoral wisdom " and " imagination " with little or no definition. Frankly, I appreciate the influence pioneers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seminary classroom, institutional setting and congregational life. Russell E. Gundlach Eastchester, N.Y. Gregory Jones and Susan Pendleton Jones have been awarded $10 million for discovering that ten-talent pastors make weak congregations strong, and one-talent pastors make strong churches weak. I wonder what the Lilly Foundation would give me for discovering that grass is green? The authors suggest that ten-talent persons stopped going to seminary " about 30 years ago, " which was when liberation theology, with its egalitarian ideology, was breaking out in seminaries like measles in a kindergarten class. Part of this ideology was that only an unjust God would give ten talents to one person and one to another. A truly just God would give five talents to all. In this context, why would truly talented persons enter ministry? It was during this time that the Consultation on Church Union constructed a document on ordination that was filled with shame because ordination seemed to introduce a class structure into the church. In the past 30 years I do not remember interviewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her leadership style with these words : " I am an enabler ; I do not lead from in front, but from beside my congregation. "( I am the Good Shepherd ; the sheep lead themselves.) Our seminaries have made our seminary students ashamed of their talents and ashamed to be leaders. We have sown mediocrity and reaped mediocrity. This is a discovery? Barry H. Downing Endwell, N.Y It is easy to see why teachers would conclude that the important need right now is better students and a stronger dose of training and teaching. They believe that now, at last, they have a handle on just what the training should look like. I do ask, out of respect for those of us who are well trained and have worked hard and long, that they consider the following observation. The last 30 years has seen an explosion of clergy training. D.Min. degrees abound. CPE flourishes. Seminars on every subject from MBTI to intensive journaling have sprung up like weeds. The current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained and taught ever. Why do we think that more, even if different, training of pastors will help create faithful, effective congregations where they do not now exist? Thomas Russell First Christian Church, St. Joseph, Mo. L. Gregory Jones and Susan Pendleton Jones respond : Obviously, not everything that needs to be said can be said in one article that, by necessity, painted with a large brush. However, these letters offer an opportunity to clarify several areas of misunderstanding : * Our article was written and at the typesetter long before the tragic events of September 11. Had it been written subsequent to that event, we would have commended those who have offered powerful witness and care in response to the tragedy. We would suggest that it is precisely those congregations and pastors who are already engaged in faithful and vital ministry who had the most to draw on in this time of crisis. * We see pastoral care as neither the saving grace( as does Russell Gundlach) nor the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of seminary education ; all of the disciplines are implicated in both positive and negative ways. We do not think more training is necessarily the answer ; we rather advocate a different pattern of education and formation. We do not think, as does Thomas Russell, that the current pastoral leadership is " the best trained and taught ever. " Those of us in seminaries need to take responsibility for not providing the best training and teaching we could. We do think we can help to reclaim connections between seminaries and congregations, and to raise the bar again of expectations and hopes for clergy, congregations and seminaries. * The challenges and problems we face emerged over time ; solutions will also take time and multiple collaborative efforts. Our intention is to promote deeper and stronger relationships, not assign blame. * The grant that Duke Divinity School received was not related to some " discovery " ; it is designed to develop programs that can help address crucial challenges, including weaknesses in the education we provide. Nonviolent protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ecumenical interfaith movement to support a mass nonviolent action in American corridors of power on behalf of the voiceless of the Middle East( " Non -- violent protest in Palestine, " Aug. 29-Sept. 5). I strongly believe that there is an untapped new generation of social activists ready to take on " one of the worst apartheid systems in the world through a mobilization of the faith community. " Why does not some peace group or coalition of activists organize teach-ins and public demonstrations in U.S. universities, schools, media centers and service groups to cry out for space in the Middle East for nonviolent protest? Those of us who were involved in these activities in the Vietnam War era know that this will work. Who will take the first steps to mobilize such an effort? John H. Sinclair Roseville, Minn.
