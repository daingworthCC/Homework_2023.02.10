2006841 Evocative of timeless Virginia architechture, our Idea House in Fredericksburg deftly blends principles of the past with a livable floor plan and lively interiors. // Central Virginia reveres its history, its heritage, and its architecture. Homes were built to be passed from one generation to the next. This respect for the past and aspiration for the future inspired our Idea House in Fredericksburg. Residential designer William Poole took as his model the Shepperd House, an 1817 Federal structure downtown. " I looked for a house that has an expression, a house that lifts the spirit, " says William. " Then I modified the plan for the present. " Our updated version, called The Shepperd House, is nestled in the 2,800-acre community of Fawn Lake. In the living room, a mingling of timeless architectural details and contemporary touches instills a fresh, energetic quality. Richmond designers Deborah Valentine and Janie Molster started with a furniture arrangement that plays off the rooms fireplace and symmetrical bookcases. A square ottoman grounds the seating arrangement, including a pair of matching love seats. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomes, Janie and Deborah took a novel approach. They mounted four velvet panels to resemble old-fashioned portieres( heavy curtains hung across a doorway) which break up the walls of shelves and soften hard edges. Amid this neutral room, a Wolf Kahn painting over the mantel adds color. SHERWINWILLIAMS Your home is one of your most important investments. Quality paint and decorating supplies are essential.

Dining Room Family meals and formal dinners have changed over the years, and our dining room offers a refreshing twist on tradition.
