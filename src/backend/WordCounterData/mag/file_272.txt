2032841 Stepping Up Build our modern version of a Shaker step stool. // Clean, common-sense design and uncompromising craftsmanship are the hallmarks of Shaker woodworking. It 's not surprising, then, that generations of modern woodworkers have paid their dues studying and reproducing the austere yet functional style of this religious sect founded in the 18th century. In part it 's the challenge : With little or no ornamentation there are only a few places to show off-in carefully planed surfaces and in the tight lines of snug joints, Our step stool is based on an original piece from a Shaker community once located in Hancock, Mass. We chose to build it out of oak, a durable and readily available wood. Pine will also do. It 's easier to work in pine, but if you decide to go that route, buy clear stock and consider moving up from 1-in. material( in. thick) to 5/4 stock and planing it down to a full inch. Whatever your choice of wood, take time with the joinery. Like everything else Shaker, it looks simpler than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Klenck step stool You can handle most of this project with a few simple hand tools. But with a wood as tough as oak, it 's handy to have power when cutting each piece to size. A portable circular saw will do the job, but if you 'd prefer increased speed and greater accuracy, start pricing table saws. Even a light-duty benchtop model will make a big difference. The Tools 1 The stool is made up of two stepped side panels, three treads and five rails. Note that the tread rails are halfdovetails that prevent the sides from spreading. We 've cut the dovetails with roughly -In. -deep shoulders to resist racking( wobbling from side to side). 2 Unlike the Shakers, you wo n't have access to wood wide enough for the sides-you 'll have to glue them up. Instead of laminating each side from random widths of stock, rip pieces so their widths match the tread notches. This way, each stepped side will be formed at assembly and require no shaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we added dowels to reinforce the grain over the arced cutout. You also could use a plate joiner-either option will help keep the boards aligned during glue-up. When the glue is dry, level any small misalignments with a hand plane, and cut the arc with a jigsaw. 3 Cut the rails to length and use a backsaw to make the -in. -deep dovetails. The cuts do n't have to be identical, but they do have to be square to the stock face. If necessary, trim them with a chisel and make sure the inner corners are sharp and clean. Clamp each dovetail at its place on a side panel and scribe the mating notch with a knife. Use a trysquare to ensure that the rail is square with the side. After marking each angled cutline, use a marking gauge to lay out the remaining notch line. Then, cut the notches and test fit the rails. 4 Bore all the screwholes in the rails. We made the hole for the screw shank and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Use these holes as a guide when boring the pilot holes in the stool sides. Join the back mid rail to the sides first, then follow with the second tread rail to create a rigid box. Then, add the three remaining rails. Apply glue to the counterbores and tap wooden plugs over the screws. Be sure to align the plug grain direction with that of the wood. Carefully pare the plugs flush with a chisel. 5 A simple founding of the front and end tread edges does n't require a fancy router setup. Instead, use a plane to first bevel the edges, then round them in a series of facets. Plane endgrain first, working toward the middle from each side. Do n't plane straight across the tread end or you 'll split the wood as the plane exits the cut. Then, bore the screwholes, add the treads to the stool frame and plug the screw counterbores. We finished our step stool with three coats of Minwax Tung Oil Finish. Sidebar Quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, orient the pieces so they have a common grain direction. This makes planing the finished panel easier. SMOOT PLANE : It trims edges for gluing and dresses faces flat. A block plane is handy for trimming. 1-IN. CHISEL : Essential for fine-tuning the joinery-just keep it sharp. BACKSAW : For straight joint cuts. COPING SAW : The stressfree way to cut the mid rail notches. CIRCULAR SAW : For rough ripping and crosscutting. JIGSAW : It shapes the arced cutouts. DRILL : To bore screwholes and drive screws. DOWELING JIG : Keeps your drill in line for dowel joints. CLAMPS : Two pipe or heavy bar clamps are the minimum. The open-ended half-dovetail notches are easy to cut. Just saw to the waste side of the scribed line, then rip from the end toward the angled cut. To make the full dovetail notch, first make both angled cuts. Then, use a coping saw to cut just above the finished joint line. Trim the remaining surface flat with a chisel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
