2037141 From The Outside, Arthur Dove 's Life Appeared Out Of Kilter, But His Inner Vision Shone Through <p> " I should like to enjoy life, " said the painter Arthur Dove, " by choosing all its highest instances, to give back in my means of expression all that it gives to me, to give in form and color the reaction that plastic objects and sensations of light from within and without have reflected from my inner consciousness.... It should be a delightful adventure. " From the evidence of his exuberant, pulsating abstractions distilled from the natural world of moon, sun, water, land, plants and farm animals, in which he was so at home, Dove surely savored an inner life of profound intellectual and spiritual richness, although the external circumstances of his adventure would strike anyone else as excruciatingly difficult rather than delightful. Fencing against privations and distractions that would have suppressed many a lesser talent, Dove evinced a hardihood as admirable as his artistic gifts. His journey, during which he created a personal symbolism that implied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bold and radical one : not merely the first American to paint a nonrepresentational painting, he was also the only painter of his generation to persevere with abstraction and follow it to its conclusions. Dove 's courage and innovation, his directness in transmuting his response to natural stimuli into art, reverberate to this day. His work, homespun yet spiritual, still speaks to contemporary artists. Among the ones who have been touched by him are Kenneth Noland, Frank Stella and Bill Jensen. <p> Although Dove( 1880-1946) is now acknowledged critically and commercially -- his status as a pioneer is unassailable, and prices for his paintings start in the six figures -- he has remained the quiet man of American modernism. His voice was so soft that someone nicknamed him " the whispering kid. " Much of his life took place away from the hurly-burly and headlines of New York City, on either a farm or a boat. Accordingly, his dealer, Alfred Stieglitz, as well as sympathetic critics, tended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mystical moon gazer, as opposed to a contemplative, complex intellectual who was keenly aware of international artistic and literary currents. Like his personality, his art was less dramatic than that of his fellow Stieglitz artists Georgia O'Keeffe and John Marin, whose pictures commanded in the thousands of dollars when Dove 's were going in the hundreds -- if a buyer could be found for one. Of the four most progressive museums in the United States collecting American contemporary art during the 1930s and 1940s, three of them -- the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Addison Gallery of American Art -- purchased nothing by Dove during the artist 's lifetime. The same held true for the more conservative survey museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Art Institute of Chicago. Only the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C., whose founder, Duncan Phillips, was an avid supporter, acquired Dove 's work while the artist was around to benefit from it. <p> Perhaps most debilitating of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him was the oversimplified conception of the artist as a mere son of the soil. That narrow casting, along with the extreme fragility of many of the works, has meant that a comprehensive display of his art last occurred in 1974. This situation has just changed, however, with " Arthur Dove : A Retrospective Exhibition, " which opened fittingly at the Phillips Collection on September 20, 1997 ; after closing on January 4, 1998, the show will travel to three other cities. To coincide with the retrospective, the Wichita Art Museum, which owns 28 mixed-media and watercolor sketches by Dove, has organized a show with the American Federation of Arts that will tour to museums in Connecticut, Texas, Maryland and California. <p> The Dove retrospective proposes a distinct point of view. The most uncompromisingly abstract paintings are spotlighted, rather than examples with more apparent representational elements in them. " I do n't see Dove as a neglected figure, but as a misunderstood one, " says Phillips Collection curator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bricker Balken, an independent scholar, and William Agee, a professor of art history( the Addison Gallery and the Phillips Collection co-organized the show). " We want to show him as a premier abstractionist, as the most radical modernist of his generation, who blazed a trail that was later picked up by the New York School. Dove found a particularly American avenue into abstraction. Quite independently he put these ideas together that led up to his unprecedented forms. " Turner also stresses Dove 's interest in the giants of European thought. His diaries reveal their share of references to Joyce, Lawrence, Einstein and Spinoza, and he carefully studied the art of Klee and Mondrian. <p> The spiraling lines of George Gershwin -- " Rhapsody in Blue, " Part I recall the clarinet solo that opens the piece. <p> This ceaseless appetite for invention emerged from the rural community of Canandaigua, New York, in the central part of the state. There Arthur Garfield Dove, who was named for the Vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, was born on August 2, 1880, to William George and Anna Chipps Dove. The son of a brickmaker who became a wealthy contractor and real estate developer, Arthur grew up in Geneva, New York, in the Finger Lakes region. He took piano and painting lessons, and was the pitcher for his high school baseball team, graduating in 1899. A career as a lawyer or businessman was envisioned, and after attending Hobart College for two years, he transferred to Cornell University to study law. But Dove 's conventional existence had already been called into question. When Dove was a boy, one of his best friends was a neighbor named Newton Weatherly, whom everyone else regarded as the village eccentric. Weatherly farmed to make a living, but he was a passionate naturalist and painter, and he taught Dove how to hunt, fish, identify plants and otherwise live off the land ; he encouraged his protege to follow his inclinations as an outdoorsman and artist. This early guide and mentor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortified Dove, giving him the courage to stand up to William Dove 's growing opposition to the direction in which his son was drifting. <p> At Cornell, Dove dropped his law studies in order to take courses that would equip him for a career as a commercial illustrator. William Dove was infuriated until he saw the money his son could make -- it was the golden age of the magazine illustrator, and successful ones like Charles Dana Gibson and Maxfield Parrish were lavishly paid and lionized. After establishing himself in Manhattan as a contributor to Harper 's, Scribner 's and several other popular magazines, Dove married Florence Dorsey, the " girl next door " from Geneva, in 1904. <p> Dove was earning plenty of money and absorbing a heady new milieu, meeting everyone from the painters John Sloan and William Glackens to the cowboy star William S. Hart. He was expected to be contented, but something was missing ; he saved up $4,000, and that sum, plus a contribution from a temporarily mollified William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the spring of 1908. Arriving in the capital of art in the midst of the Fauve and Cubist explosions, Dove met many other questing young Americans, including John Marin, Alfred Maurer, Jo Davidson, Arthur B. Carles and Max Weber. These artists were anchored to Paris, preferring to imbibe the gospel of modernism in the cafes and studios, but urban pleasures did not hold Dove. Most of the time he journeyed outside the city to paint Impressionist landscapes. He and Florence migrated as far south as Cagnes-sur-Mer, on the Mediterranean coast, where Renoir was still working. Dove could never sever himself from the countryside for any length of time ; when he left Europe, he was producing still lifes and landscapes indebted to Cezanne and the Fauves. <p> The Doves returned to the United States in July of 1909, and as a result of his Parisian interlude, the artist announced that his goal in life was no longer illustration. He wanted to paint full-time ; moreover, he resolved " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Asked for an allowance to support this venture, William Dove refused to help, his disapproval unalterable. Arthur Dove would not be free from financial anxieties again for another 30 years. <p> On July 4, 1910, Arthur and Florence Dove had a son, William. After his birth, the family settled on a farm in Westport, Connecticut, where Dove planned to grow vegetables, raise chickens and sell eggs while pursuing painting in his " spare " time. An event that would equally transform Dove 's future had already transpired in late 1909 or early 1910. Maurer had apparently arranged an introduction for his friend to Alfred Stieglitz, the acclaimed photographer, charismatic impresario and adamant champion of the vanguard. In 1905 Stieglitz had opened the Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession, at 291 Fifth Avenue, which was at first devoted to photography ; in 1907 the exhibition space also began to show the most iconoclastic movements in painting, drawing and sculpture, and by now its name was simply " 291. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already organized the first Rodin and Matisse exhibitions in America and was showing Marin, Maurer and Marsden Hartley. Like the painters he promoted, Stieglitz had left the establishment behind him and was prepared to risk rejection and ridicule for the modernist cause. <p> Urban, autocratic, argumentative and flamboyant, Stieglitz did not share Dove 's serene temperament, but the two men were united in their dedication to art, and in what Dove would eventually call " the idea " -- that verisimilitude was insufficient for conveying the vibrant emotions that natural phenomena stirred in him. This principle supplied Dove with a coherence that informed his entire body of work. As the art historian Ann Lee Morgan has pointed out, when Dove met Stieglitz, he was doing competent but unoriginal Fauve still lifes ; afterward, Dove abandoned illusionism for good and never made another completely representational painting again. He was in the process of metamorphosing from a follower into a leader. <p> Besides representing Dove, Stieglitz also stepped into the role of the sympathetic father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Dove often referred to Stieglitz as his " other old man " and testified, " I do not think I could have existed as a painter without that super-encouragement and the battle he has fought day by day for twenty-five years. " When Dove 's paintings were not selling, which was most of the time, Stieglitz helped him with occasional checks in lieu of the family assistance the artist never received. <p> Fired by Stieglitz 's belief in him, Dove began redefining his approach to landscape painting, working on a group of oils and pastels of rural scenes and plants whose contours were distilled from but did not imitate nature. As in Movement No. 1 and Plant Forms of 1911-12, Dove limited his palette to blacks, whites and earth tones, and reduced the number of shapes he used to essentials. Employing ovoid and spiral forms, he suggested the fecundity of vegetal life, which he saw as a metaphor for his own artistic creativity. The convoluted hills and valleys and surging leaves radiate profuse, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the phallic urgency of Dylan Thomas ' famous lyric cry, " The force that through the green fuse drives the flower / Drives my green age. " <p> In February 1912, Dove received a solo show at 291. He exhibited ten of these organic pastels, which came to be known as the " Ten Commandments. " As the first public display of abstract art by an American, they rained notoriety on Dove, first in New York and then in Chicago, where they were seen a month later. Manhattanites disdained the show as incomprehensible nonsense, but in the Midwest there was one buyer. The prescient collector Arthur Jerome Eddy, who would shortly write a book on Cubism and Postimpressionism, purchased a pastel. <p> Despite this breakthrough -- Dove had propelled himself to the forefront of abstraction independently of Kandinsky, whose art he had not yet seen -- Dove did not capitalize on it, hardly painting at all during that decade. His output dwindled primarily to a few charcoal drawings and pastels. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he even returned to the illustrating assignments he hated in order to gain a livelihood. Yet there was still very little money. A check for $150 from Stieglitz in December 1916, a godsend to Dove, was meant as encouragement, but Stieglitz despaired of his ever painting again. <p> In May 1917 Dove wrote to Stieglitz, " I hope to be painting again by the first of June... but the future for anything here does n't look very bright. " It was not very bright for Stieglitz, either. The entry of the United States into World War I, coupled with increasing financial pressures, led to Stieglitz 's closing 291 just when Dove wrote to him. Dove was psychologically dependent on Stieglitz, who introduced and controlled all of his work, and the existence of the gallery guaranteed a safe harbor for it. The demise of 291 must have devastated Dove -- he exhibited only sparsely until Stieglitz returned to dealing in 1925. <p> In the spring of 1917, Florence Dove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the wife of another artist in Westport, but she and her husband were no longer getting along. Meanwhile, the Doves had become friendly with another local couple, Clive and Helen Torr Weed ; Clive Weed was a cartoonist, and the auburn-haired Helen, whom everyone called " Reds, " was a painter. Dove and Reds started going out on sketching expeditions together, and in the autumn of 1921 they left their spouses for each other. Understandably angry, Florence Dove would not give her husband a divorce, and she refused to let him see their child. It was impossible for Dove or Torr to live out of wedlock in the midst of their old circle in Westport, so they moved onto a houseboat in upper Manhattan. Even the death of Dove 's father in 1921 did not ease the couple 's plight ; he did not leave money to subsidize the messy life he felt Dove was leading.( As Dove reported to Stieglitz, " Brother here the other day as ambassador from Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ' to smooth things over, ' but with too coarse sandpaper. Family first, safety first, duty first, and spirit last. ") In 1922, Dove bought a 42-foot yawl, the Mona, which served as their residence until 1933. Starting in 1924, they docked at Halesite, in Huntington Bay, on the north shore of Long Island. <p> With Helen Torr in his life, Dove soared out of the creative doldrums he had been in for nearly a decade. Painting and drawing with a vengeance, he regained his momentum and never slackened again. Eager to share his news with Stieglitz, Dove wrote in August of 1921, " It is great to be at it again. I feel more like a person than I have in years. " No one could have been more receptive to Dove 's newfound happiness than Stieglitz. Never on the side of conventional morality to begin with, in 1918 the married photographer had met a 30-year-old painter who had shown her work during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgia O'Keeffe -- moved to New York in June of 1918 at Stieglitz 's invitation ; a month later, Stieglitz left his wife and moved in with her, beginning a legendary creative and conjugal partnership. <p> S( COLOR) : Tight quarters shared with Helen Torr aboard the Mona did n't dampen Dove 's experimenting during the mid- ' 20s, from the collage Goin ' Fishin '( top) to metallic paint for Golden Storm. <p> Helen Torr believed in Dove 's talents without question. She accepted his destitute financial predicament and willingly sacrificed physical comfort to his art. Life aboard the Mona was cramped, damp and exhausting, with constant chores to do, but Dove 's renewal was in full flower by the time he and Reds first docked in Halesite. In 1924 he produced 29 paintings, gleefully telling Stieglitz, " Just to let you know I have corralled five or six more paintings two of which I could guarantee to start a riot in almost any gallery.... Have certainly broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is wonderful to be painting. " The gallery to which Dove referred was the Anderson Galleries on Park Avenue, where Stieglitz was mounting an exhibition.( Later he took over one of the Anderson 's rooms, which would become his next exhibiting enterprise, the Intimate Gallery.) The first show, which opened in March 1925, was called " Seven Americans, " and the participants were Stieglitz, Marin, O'Keeffe, Hartley, Charles Demuth, Paul Strand and Dove. " Seven Americans " marked Dove 's first major show in 13 years and the commencement of an annual exhibiting schedule with Stieglitz for another 20. <p> Fog Horns, from 1929 : not only the floating quality of the overlapping rings but also the muted, complex colors capture the haunting sound. <p> Dove 's reinvigoration burst forth in canvases like Sunrise, Penetration and Waterfall, which celebrated the abundance of nature, often with erotic overtones. The artist also had widened his gaze beyond the land and looked heavenward : from about 1923 onward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. But one day in 1924, Dove told Torr that he was " tired of putting brush strokes on canvas, " and for the next six years, Dove essayed collage. Taking found objects and odd materials tinged with associations with the actual subject of the assemblage, he combined them to create witty landscapes, portraits and notations of everyday experiences whose inventiveness seemed to tap into the frugal, self-reliant ethos he absorbed from Newton Weatherly. One of the finest of Dove 's collages, Goin ' Fishin '( 1925), bubbles with a Huck Finn mood of fun-loving rebellion. The materials used in it -- bamboo sticks, buttons and the sleeve of a denim work shirt -- are humble and unassuming, yet utterly unorthodox in this context, and the artist exults in their tactile qualities. The portraits are memorable, too. Ralph Dusenberry( 1924) is a lively homage to a Long Island neighbor who was a diver and swimmer. Dusenberry was an architect, and his profession is symbolized by the carpenter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( 1925) mocks the conservative critic Royal Cortissoz, a staunch antimodernist. Much in the spirit of Paul Klee, Dove debunks the pretensions of reigning cultural pieties, giving the critic a top hat, a monocle and an empty head. <p> But the collages, for all their elegance and humor, were ultimately too narrative for Dove, who felt the pull of abstraction, and in the late 1920s he was concentrating on painting again. No longer experimenting with other media, he was ready to investigate another art form. In line with artists from Whistler to Kandinsky, Dove believed that music was an abstract art that freed its creators from anecdote or literalism, and aboard the Mona he listened to jazz on the radio or phonograph. Positing jazz as a quintessential expression of modern life, Dove embarked on visual equivalents of jazz compositions distinguished by the movement of advancing and receding lines. These paintings are more calligraphic than his other work, and the many undulating lines suggest syncopated rhythms. In particular, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Blue, " Part I( 1927) is analogous to the rising notes of the clarinet solo that opens Gershwin 's symphonic work. Perhaps Dove 's most evocative meditation on music was the ineffable Fog Horns( 1929), with its quivering, overlapping rings that mimic sound waves rippling over the water. <p> By the late 1920s the critics praised Dove 's work, but there were few buyers, and Dove and Torr were more pinched than ever. About Dove 's 1930 exhibition, in Stieglitz 's last gallery, An American Place, the New Yorker raved, " The fireworks of a truly great American painter, hung against white walls, fairly take away your breath. Dove has carried his art to a further point than any other American we know.... We are sorry that he works in a country enslaved by the shackles of representational painting. " Shortly after this review appeared, Dove was again writing to Stieglitz about money woes, " If only I can keep going -- for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for another week and then... the food stops. " <p> But in 1930, hope materialized in the form of the patron, collector and museum founder Duncan Phillips. Phillips, who had opened his gallery in his Washington, D.C. house to the public in 1921, was busy buying a range of American and European paintings. In 1926, Phillips visited the Intimate Gallery and bought two recent canvases by Dove, Golden Storm and Waterfall. Four years later, in exchange for having the first pick of Dove 's annual exhibitions, Phillips offered $50 a month to the painter. Meager though the stipend was -- and even that amount was not without problems, because sometimes Phillips was casual about paying and then pleaded poverty to the cold and hungry artist -- the agreement provided stability and was a gesture of faith in Dove. Phillips, who was an eminently decent man as well as a discerning connoisseur, later arranged more generous terms and went on to amass the largest public collection of Dove 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dove, Florence Dove died in October 1929. The artist was reunited with his son and married Reds. Life was still hard -- the Doves felt the Depression, although it was n't as if they had lived well before -- but they finally seemed close to attaining a modicum of stability. Then Dove 's mother died in January of 1933, and the couple was forced to move back to Geneva, arriving that July. <p> The Dove estate was rich in acreage but cash-poor and highly mortgaged, and Dove had to become a farmer all over again to manage it. If a parcel of land was sold off, the money went toward taxes ; the inheritance was a curse. Dove dreaded living in Geneva, yet he worked more fruitfully there at his art. As usual, he responded to his environment, charting the autumn foliage, the animals and crops, and even the industrial development taking place in the area. The Geneva paintings, particularly the glowing " Sunrise " series, represent a remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they seem animated by invisible forces. Pulsating lines, heaving surfaces, ragged edges and swollen circular forms floating in empty space push the pictorial field out in all directions. The space is charged with energy, and the canvases possess a hypnotic aura. <p> In the spring of 1937, Dove was able to sell the family farm, and some of the burden of the estate eased ; better still, Duncan Phillips gave Dove a retrospective and, separately from the stipend( which he raised to $100 a month), bought Goin ' Fishin ' for $2,000, a price the artist never dreamed of achieving. Escape from Geneva was in sight. On April 16, 1938, the couple departed for New York City and never looked back. <p> The Doves gladly went back to Long Island and bought an abandoned post office in Centerport, a shorefront town not far from Halesite. They were landlubbers now, although the building looked out on a tidal pool and Dove could watch the seagulls in flight from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dove 's health began to break down. He suffered from heart trouble and Bright 's disease, a progressive disintegration of the kidneys that quickly left him a semi-invalid. <p> The vigorous man who was used to chopping wood and mowing hay now found himself confined to a wheelchair. Stieglitz helped out with a check for $1,000, and Phillips raised his stipend to $200 a month, without demanding that Dove produce any paintings in return. Dove could relax about money at long last. <p> Dove 's medical condition impeded but did not keep him from working or, indeed, developing. Important late paintings like Rain or Snow( 1943) and That Red One( 1944) have crisp, simplified formats. Most notably, Dove was emphasizing hard-edged geometric forms in his canvases, a departure from his characteristic blurred and amorphous shapes. The references to external reality grew less overt ; the artist had enough history behind him to depend on his own means. As he wrote to the critic Elizabeth McCausland in 1943, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- just seeking inside. " <p> A summation of both a lifetime of sun paintings and his late style, the highly abstract That Red One was painted in 1944, two years before Dove died. <p> On July 13, 1946, Stieglitz died of heart failure, and Dove 's own death occurred just over four months later, on November 22. Both men left a legacy to American art. For Dove, it was getting at the essence of inner consciousness and external experience -- less a matter of abstraction, he said, than " extraction, gravitation toward a certain direction, and minding your own business. " Against heavy odds he did all these things, and with a fortitude that can only be called heroic. <p> PHOTO( COLOR) : Dove 's Sunrise III( 1936) radiates an energy far exceeding its three-foot width. <p> PHOTO( BLACK &; WHITE) : The most radical modernist of his generation, Dove blazed a trail that was later picked up by the New York School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretensions of the critic, giving him a top hat, a monocle and an empty head. <p> By Avis Berman <p> <p> Writer Avis Berman is working on a book about James McNeill Whistler and the literary world. <p>
