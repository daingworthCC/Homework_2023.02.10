2024641 The subject of an appropriately shape-shifting exhibition seen in Paris, Washington and now New York, Dada was the 20th century 's most all-inclusive and far-reaching art movement, rejecting nothing, no matter how vulgar, provocative or insincere. Today 's art is, in many ways, its product.

" including the first-ever institutional survey of the unruly Dada movement. Obliged as a matter of conscience to decry and satirize the arrogant social, commercial, military and political regimes with anything to gain from World War I, the Dada artists, along with their works, were targeted in the ' ' 3Os as " degenerate " by Fascist ideologues usurping ever more power. Reuniting some of the works from the historic 1936 MOMA exhibition, or replicas of them, as in the dizzying case of Marcel Duchamp 's motorized Rotary Glass Plates( 1920/1979), this past February the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., was home to the exhibition " Dada, " with over 400 stingingly tragicomic items, many no less provocative today than when they were first made. Images of wheels were abundant, mostly disengaged wheels incapable of getting anywhere, none more dramatic than Duchamp 's striped plates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great exhibition, with its informative, lavishly illustrated catalogue, coincides with the publication of Exquisite Dada : A Comprehensive Bibliography, edited by Jrgen Schfer, the 10th and final volume of a sweeping study of the chronologically brief( 1915-1923) movement, edited since 1979 by Stephen C. Foster and given the overall title of Crisis and the Arts : The History of Dada.1 In irregular Dada fashion, both Exquisite Dada and " Dada " were seemingly planned to mark, of all things, the 89th or 90th anniversary of the 20th century 's most all-inclusive and far-reaching art movement, predicated on a notion of " art " taken as broadly as possible, whatever the means and mode of expression. Nothing was excluded, no matter how amateur, vulgar, insincere or ephemeral-the edgier and funnier the better. Dada was theatrical, with a slapstick emphasis on anticlimax ; it was omni-critical, meta-ironic, politically subversive, morally freewheeling, poetically prosaic. " Someone steps on your toes. It 's Dada, " explained the 1921 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @). Organized in conjunction with the Centre Pompidou in Paris, where from Oct. 5, 2005 to Jan. 9, 2006, well more than twice as many items were on display as were shown in Washington, this remarkable exhibition will finally be presented at MOMA, beginning on June 18. Like Surrealism, the most immediate of its many ongoing legacies to modern culture, Dada was at least as much about literature as about the plastic arts, and while both the National Gallery and the Centre Pompidou presentations included empty rooms where visitors could listen to recordings of the greatest Dada sound poetry by Jean Arp, Hugo Ball, Raoul Hausmann, Richard Huelsenbeck and Kurt Schwitters, the French version of the show additionally incorporated an antic profusion of printed matter and autograph notes. " The substance of Dada turns out to be the creation of hundreds of paper documents exchanged on a roughly daily basis during the dozen years of the movement 's existence, " explains Pompidou curator Laurent Le Bon in the encyclopedia-style French version of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sections on artists at work outside the key Dada centers, from Brussels to Tokyo.2 As installed at the Centre Pompidou( a floor plan is included in the catalogue), the exhibition was divided into nearly 50 separate rooms, some devoted to centers like Zurich and New York, others to individual artists, events, publications or art genres. This mazelike installation concept resulted in considerable redundancy, and even a cursory inspection took days. But for fanatics it was sublime. For example, the multifaceted approach was endorsed during " Dada in Debate, " a two-day symposium held at London 's Tate Modern last November in response to the concurrent exhibition at the Pompidou. Organized by David Hopkins( University of Glasglow) and Michael White( York University), " Dada in Debate " will be published as an independent supplement to the important new Dada studies issued in direct conjunction with the exhibition. National Gallery curator Leah Dickerman, however, was determined to bring as much coherence as possible to the sprawling subject, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into seven sections corresponding to the cities where Dada flourished most. She thus followed the same linear organizational prototype selected by Duchamp himself when he organized " Dada 1916-1923 " for the Sidney Janis Gallery in New York in 1953. Including some key examples of Dada printed matter, but no manuscript materials, Duchamp assembled 212 items, which he divided into eight consecutive urban episodes : Zurich, New York, Hannover, Cologne, Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam and Other Centers. Dickerman, as had Duchamp. featured in the " Zurich " section a sample of the works made by Picabia during his brief visit to the Swiss Dada center in early 1919. Whether by way of the January 1919 issue of Picabia 's extraordinary periodical 391, which Duchamp included in his 1953 show, or the images Picabia contributed to Dada 4-5, as the poet Tristan Tzara 's publication was titled, Picabia 's wheel-ridden images were immediately circulated from Zurich throughout every other Dada city, transcending any lingering notion of isolated Dada cells and immediately inspiring wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others. Dada 4-5 featured a reproduction of a print that Picabia had just made by pressing on paper the inked gears of an alarm clock that he had destroyed as a sort of object lesson to his Swiss colleagues when he first met them in person. // Francis Picabia : Alarm Clock I, illustration on the title page of the journal Dada 4-5 : Dada Anthology.

Research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although unlisted in Matthew S. Witkovsky 's most helpful, city-by-city 1911-1926 chronology( included in both of the very different French and American exhibition catalogues), Washington, D.C., events can hardly be ignored in any historical account of the Dada movement.3 Promoting " Dada " at the entrance to the I. M. Pei-designed East Building of the National Gallery was a billboard-style image of L.H.O.O.Q.( 1919), Duchamp 's famously defaced reproduction of Leonardo da Vinci 's Mono, Lisa accompanied by the title inscription, which, read aloud in French, constitutes an irreverent Dada commentary on the portrait 's subject.4 Flaunted here, of all places, Duchamp 's unsurpassed icon of modern art 's contempt for museum values( and, by the way, a work not included in the 1936 MOMA exhibition) would surely have dismayed retired secretary of the Treasury, Andrew W. Mellon, under investigation in late 1936 for income tax evasion. Just before Christmas of that year, Mellon sent word to President Franklin D. Roosevelt that he wished to give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation, along with the funds to construct a National Gallery of Art on the Mall. When Congress accepted this extraordinary gift in March 1937, it was with the stipulation that no work of lesser quality ever be added to the collection. So drastically have museum art standards changed since then, in large part thanks to Dada, that could the National Gallery manage to acquire this Duchamp " masterpiece "( now owned by a private collector in Paris, its market value somewhere around $10 million), the museum would certainly be justified in boasting about it. Income tax and its evasion played an important role in the development of America as a showcase for living artists from other countries. As I understand it, legislation promulgating the federal income tax was passed by Congress in February 1913 in order to make up for the revenues that would be lost when the government removed tariffs on imported goods-a gesture meant to discourage foreign tariffs on booming American exports. Indeed, the Woodrow Wilson administration eliminated import taxes on a wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13,1913. Writing enthusiastically about the global art-market implications of the Underwood legislation in the May 12, 1914, issue of Parix-Joiimal, poet-critic-art impresario Guillaume Apollinaire expressed frustration that nonAmerican artists had till then been obliged to file tariff-exempting export papers at the American Embassy.5 Presumably the proto-Dada Apollinaire( to whom an entry is devoted in the French catalogue) was privy to the problems faced by Parisbased Constantin Brancusi when he sent sculptures to New York in early 1914 for exhibition at Alfred Stieglitz 's famous 291 Gallery. The works were held up by U.S. Customs officials pending receipt of an affidavit stating that the works were made by the artist himself, and none of them realized in more than three examples.6 Setting the stage for an explosion of American galleries with the capacity to represent living European artists, the Underwood Tariff Act was primarily what created the conditions for Dada art to be exhibited in New York before it was shown anywhere else. Equally important, by placing esthetic decisions under the administration of American Customs and Embassy officials, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status to the now tediously perennial question, so very fundamental to Dada, of what might or might not be considered to be art. As if to take issue with the Underwood Tariff Act 's bias in favor of art unrelated to industrial manufacture, by the end of 1915 Francis Picabia 's diagrammatic images of machines with humorous inscribed titles( which were first presented as illustrations in 291, Stieglitz 's deluxe modern-art periodical) began to appear in New York gallery exhibitions. The pioneering status of New York Dada was obscured in the National Gallery installation, the opening section of which was devoted to " Zurich, " where the term Dada was supposedly invented in early 1916 as a sort of brand name for the zealously unconventional activities of an international colony of writers, artists and performers escaping military action in neutral Switzerland. Omitted from the Washington version of the exhibition was the 1884 illustrated edition of Jules Verne 's L ' ' toile du Sud( The Southern Star), which was on view at the Centre Pompidou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pet ostrich named " Dada. " Such an impressive piece of evidence to support the French paternity claim to Dada would have been bolstered considerably by references to the goofy proto-Dada items( such as a woman 's stocking presented as a basrelief) exhibited by humorists in Paris beginning in 1882 at the popular annual Arts Incohrents benefit exhibitions. " But neither the Paris nor the Washington exhibition did much justice to the key forerunners of official 1915-23 Dada.

Photo Rob Shelley. c National Gallery of Art. // Aside from how it confuses chronological issues, the city-by-city organization at the National Gallery disregarded how two or more cities can have equally reasonable historical claims to some key Dada works. Take the core Dada idea of considering a functional manufactured object as art. It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, when, during a visit to an aircraft exhibition in Paris with Fernand Lger and Brancusi, he asked what contemporary artist could make a work any better than a propeller. Although Duchamp first gave physical form to this challenge in his Paris studio in 1913, it was the " New York " section of the National Gallery 's installation that included his earliest " readymades, " Bicycle Wieel( 1913) and Bottle Rack( 1914) -not the original Paris works, lost long ago, but replicas made with the artist 's approval, in 1951 and 1964 respectively. It was in New York, however, that Duchamp first included a manufactured object in an art exhibition, not Bicycle Wheel, nor Bottle Rack, but a Dada object that addressed Washington tax policy! Congressman Oscar Wilder Underwood was seemingly invoked by one of Duchamp 's two readymades included in the Apr. 3-29,1916, " Exhibition of Modern Art " at the Bourgeois Gallery in New York : Traveler 's Folding Item, the soft form-fitting cover( inscribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep dust out of the world 's leading typewriters, manufactured by a Connecticut company with no relation to the politician, as far as I know. Given the Washington connection, it is too bad that the 1964 replica of Traveler 's Folding Item( the original of which was apparently discarded by Duchamp) was not included in the National Gallery 's version of the show, as it had been at the Centre Pompidou. The Dada replica issue still bedevils art historians, collectors and museum professionals. In 1987, during the course of being interviewed for the curatorship of 20th-century painting and sculpture at the Art Institute of Chicago, I was asked what I considered to be the most significant modern work still in private hands and so hypothetically available for acquisition. Although it hardly amounts to a painting( few Dada works do), I felt obliged to designate L.H.O.O.Q., albeit with misgivings about whether trustee support could be forthcoming for what even then might have been a multimillion dollar expenditure on a color reproduction vandalized with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview, I went on to explain how this " same " work could be obtained-in concept, at least-for far less, since Duchamp had issued a full-color replica version in 1964( in an edition of 35), which sold then for as little as $10,000. For museum display purposes, the replica would have essentially the same value as the unique original, at least in my opinion. But in 1987 even that far smaller price seemed ridiculous to traditional modern art collectors. Regardless of whether the museum 's library already owned one, I suggested that it would be best to acquire a copy of the March 1920 issue of 391, then available for something like $2,000. That particular issue of 391 included the first-ever reproduction of LH.O.O.Q., " inaccurate, " to be sure-for reasons explained below-but arguably no less important than the original, which Duchamp otherwise never made public until he exhibited it in Paris in 1930, after the Dada movement was a thing of the past. Although I got the job and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get ahold of during my years at the Art Institute, I never managed to obtain any version oil.H.O.O.Q. I was delighted to see the Duchamp original and the March 1920 391 replica juxtaposed in the National Gallery display.8 Photograph Picabia : Dance of Saint Guy, 1919-20, later refabricated and retitled Tabac-Rat( Rat Tobacco) by the artist, 1946-49, twine, board and ink in open gilt wood frame, 41 1/8 by 33 fraction three-eighth inches.

See article this issue. Dada-minded, Duchamp seemingly preferred that LH.O.O.Q. be known exclusively through reproduction, as was already the case with his infamous Fountain( 1917). A Stieglitz photograph of Fountain had appeared right away as an illustration in the second number of the New York Dada journal Tiie Blind Man, whereas the original readymade sculpture( an unmodified urinal) was never exhibited, sold or even preserved for future use.11 So while experimental collage and assemblage works by Cubist and Futurist artists had already incorporated fragments of everyday stuff like newspapers and fabrics into works of art, Duchamp and his Dada colleagues seemingly sought, in an anti-collage spirit, to insert images of artworks made for that purpose into everyday nonart formats, such as newssheets and magazines. When it was up to him. Duchamp preferred after 1917 not to exhibit his own works.

" Whether best considered as " neglectfully incorrect, " " satirically unfinished " or " judiciously edited, " the lack of such an essential detail as the goatee nevertheless makes Picabia 's humorously inept reproduction of his friend 's pictorial joke intriguingly comparable to his own lost blackboard work, the punningly titled Riz au Nez( Laugh in Your Face), which was erased before the eyes of the audience at the first Paris Dada event on Jan. 23, 1920.12 The following year, rumors circulated that Picabia might send to the Salon d'Automne a work designed to explode, and all the target images in his works of the early 1920s could be understood as so many invitations for viewers to take aim at them.13 To the best of my knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L.H.O.O.Q. is lost to posterity, as if once it had served its purpose as the basis for the 391 illustration, it was not worth keeping. At the Dada-Vorfrhling exhibition in Cologne in April 1920, Max Ernst presented a( since lost) work along with a hatchet for anyone wishing to obliterate it. Such prototypes by Picabia and Ernst must have guided Man Ray when, at the tail end of Dada in 1923( if we take his word for it), he attached the image of an eye excerpted from some unwanted photograph to the blade of a metronome, resulting in a magnificent plastic poem about romantic obsession, which he titled Object to be Destroyed. But as far as 1 know, Man Ray did not exhibit this sculpture until 1933, on the occasion of a Surrealist group show at a Paris gallery.

Paris. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Gallery exhibition incorporated Object to be Destroyed( now known as Indestructible Object) in the guise of a quite fine replica from a 1964 edition that would not be out of place in an inclusive survey of the Pop-art era. Recalling the pre-Pop years when Dada art was still a risky affair, art historian Robert Rosenblum expressed good-natured dismay after seeing " Dada " at the National Gallery. Noting the absence of a sufficiently rambunctious and historically accurate account of the 1915-1923 spirit, he asked me, " Where were the hammers and axes to destroy the art? " To the degree that the presentation of the Dada works in Washington was thoughtful, and often elegant, to that same degree the presentation disregarded the essential and determining values of many artworks never intended for exhibition in the first place.14 It is not clear whether Picabia ever exhibited some of his most amateurishly vulgar and iconoclastic works, for example, the assemblage consisting of a toy monkey affixed to a backboard, its right arm raised in emphasis, while its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masturbation. " Portrait of Czanne, Portrait of Renoir, Still Lives, Portrait of Rembrandt " is carelessly inscribed on the backboard support around the monkey. Documented by a photograph that illustrates the first issue of Cannibale, a new Picabia journal appearing in April 1920, the original ultra-Dada work would count as a masterpiece, had it survived. But it did not, because it was not intended to. Picabia( who died in 1953, before market and museum demand for exhibition copies of lost Dada works intensified) never replicated this monkey assemblage, although in the late 1940s he did make a replica of another work from early 1920. Consisting of an empty picture frame, with " identifying " labels on strings stretched across its back, this " missing " work was exhibited at the 1922 Salon des Indpendants, documented with a snapshot, and then seemingly discarded.15 Acquired in 1988 by the Centre Pompidou, the unique 1946-49 replica was admirably installed at the National Gallery, the wall cut away around it so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see views through its void. We can only guess how Picabia intended it to be presented in the early 1920s. Photograph Man Ray : Obstruction, 1961( replica of 1920 original), wooden coat hangers, 43 by 47 by 47 inches. Moderna Museet, Stockholm. // Issues of loss and replication have especially obscured the status of Man Ray as a pioneering Dada master. Made in Dada fashion from trash, his Lampshade( 1919) has the distinction of being the first Dada object ever to be acquired by a museum-in 1920. But by January 1921 the patron of the so-called Socit Anonyme, Katherine Dreier, who had purchased the work, informed the artist that since the original cardboard Lampshade readymade had gone limp, she would appreciate a replica in metal. Presumably the earliest photographs of this work, including the one sold as a postcard by Dreier 's private New York museum, show the first replicated version of the work, consisting of a long white rectangular form attached at opposite corners to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, simultaneously presenting interior and exterior surfaces, recto and verso, from every possible point of view, while projecting its own shadow onto itself as well as onto its surroundings.( There is a reproduction of the Socit Anonyme Lampshade in the July 1920 number of 391.) Known only from a photograph, another sheet-metal version of Lampshade, this one made in Paris in the early 1920s, shows the work( without any pole element) attached at one corner to the ceiling so that it spirals downwards. It is unknown whether the artist modified the work because he could not find the right sort of pole in Paris, whether( as seems more likely) he felt obliged not to copy a work already in Dreier 's possession, or whether he had evolved a more advanced idea of the original work. Whatever the case may be, the version included in the National Gallery 's New York section of " Dada " is a 1954 variation( issued in 1959 as an edition of 100) of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Man Ray 's lost 1920 accumulation sculpture made from 63 coat hangers( or, rather, his 1961 replica of the lost original) were installed overhead at the National Gallery, similarly to how Alexander Calder installed his mobile sculptures beginning in the 1930s. While Obstruction is quite beautiful presented as an overhead work, it hardly gets in the way of anything, as called for by its Dada title. By contrast, the Pompidou version of " Dada " included the 1920 Man Ray photograph that at first had been titled Moving Sculpture, printed from a glass plate negative( roughly 3 by 4 inches in size), showing windswept white linens hanging from clotheslines. This quintessential Dada documentary photograph concerns the same unprecedented modern issues addressed in Obstruction and Lampshade : the possibility of sculpture as an intrusion or a physical barrier ; and the possibility of sculpture as a surface matrix for cinematic interplays of light and shadow. Unfortunately for his historical reputation, Man Ray, with Dada nonchalance, never exhibited nor later bothered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently something ominous about the hanging " sculptures " depicted in Dada-period Man Ray photographs. For example, Man Ray 's 1921 manipulated photograph of Dada impresario Tristan Tzara features a threatening " sculpture " comprising a rope dangling from a pulley( if that is what it is) with a hatchet tied to one end and an alarm clock to the other. Whether or not this sculpture should be attributed to Man Ray, it is a Dada gem. Man Ray receives full credit for a similar, never exhibited and now lost " sculpture " on the danger theme : Compass( 1920). Documented as a sort of perverse trompe-l'oeil still life in a 1920 photograph the size of his glass-plate negative, Compass consisted of a suspended horseshoe magnet which has attracted a World War I era semi-automatic pistol. In the National Gallery installation, Compass hung nearby the pair of enlarged photographs that Man Ray had made to send to Paris for exhibition at the June 1921 Salon Dada.

And what about his famous Gift ' '! Created on impulse on the eve of Man Ray 's historic December 1921 solo exhibition in Paris( and thus not included in that exhibition 's checklist), the flat clothes iron with upholstery tacks glued to its pressing surface was evidently stolen at the exhibition opening. Unless the artist managed to photograph the work as soon as it was finished, the undated photograph that documents the work, first published in the artist 's 1963 autobiography, Self-Portrait, probably shows a replica of the immediately lost original. As far as I know, it was in 1953 that Man Ray first showed any replica version of the object itself, at the " Dada 1916-1923 " exhibition at Sidney Janis. Since then it has become a famous Dada sculpture. During the Dada era itself, however, the artist seemingly discarded his three-dimensional works once he had recorded them in photographs-so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but photographs of works of art, created with no call to survive except as documentation.

Incorporating a documentary photograph of an " accumulation " of cigarette butts, Man Ray 's extraordinary collage on plywood, Trans Atlantique( 1921), included in the Centre Pompidou version of " Dada, " corresponds with yet another of Duchamp 's " Photo " notes : " piles-heaps-of similar things( stretcher keys)( sponges 10th St.) " 18 It seems essential to stress that by the time Man Ray began to print his photographs as works of art, rather than as documentary reproductions, he had moved on from Dada. But what sort of historical status as sculpture, if any, should be extended to the objects documented in his Dada photographs, or Duchamp 's photographs documenting objects that were never replicated after World War II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replicate or not to replicate-that was and still is the Dada question par excellence. // Left, Man Bay 's Dadaphoto, in the magazine New York Dada, editors Duchamp and Man Ray, April 1921.

Barnes and more recently by the Museum of Modern Art in New York-the tailor-shop mannequin sculptures in these works were surely the inspiration for two of the highlights of the current exhibition, included both in Washington and Paris.

Schwitters eventually incorporated The Holy Affliction into his monumental Merzbau environment, located at the back of his home in Hannover. As is well known, Schwitters 's prolonged development of the Merzbau was interrupted when the artist fled Nazi Germany in 1937, and the work in progress was destroyed in 1943 as a result of the war-easily the most serious loss among all the many Dada works that did not survive.

While these works were made in Hannover to be sure, it would have been nice to include at least a few of them in the " New York " section, since so many of the Schwitters works on view had been displayed by Dreier at her Socit Anonyme already in 1920, and then immediately acquired by her. It seems likely that Dreier attended the Dada Fair during her visit to Germany in the summer of 1920 and no less likely that she obtained a copy Dada Almanack, the Richard Huelsenbeck-edited monograph published that year in Berlin. Dada Almanack includes an exhibition publicity photograph showing Heartfleld and Grosz standing beside The Middle-Class Philistine Heartfleld Gone Wild, a tailor dummy with one of its legs replaced by a prosthesis, as if the artists intended it to represent an amputee veteran. My considered guess is that this photographic documentation of the Heartfleld-Grosz assemblage is what prompted Man Ray in New York to create his famous Dadaphoto, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, half life model( probably the infamous Baroness Eisa von Freytag-Loringhoven).20 Because she is wearing a single black stocking that disappears against a black background, she appears to be missing her lower right leg. Imagine if Man Ray had ever exhibited this living Dada sculpture! The artist evidently created the work specifically as a reproduction for the unique April 1921 issue of New York Dada, in which it was printed in blue inks and( erroneously) laid out as a horizontal image. The New York Dada version is perhaps best described as documentation of a collage, since Man Ray pasted a postage stamp on the photograph to cover the pubic hair of his model, as if to self-censor the image for publication. No trace has ever been found of the strange mannequin armature component of this remarkable work, now titled Coat Stand. The damaged print of Coat Stand included in the National Gallery exhibition must be the remnant of the collage illustrated in the 1921 periodical, the postage stamp clumsily removed at some unknown date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response to Heartfleld and Grosz 's The Middle-Class Philistine Heartfleld Gone Wild, made in Berlin in 1920, Man Ray 's Coat Stand, made in New York, in turn inspired some key Dada images made by Max Ernst in 1921 in Cologne. The close similarities between Coat Stand and a lost collage by Ernst titled Santa conversazione( 1921), known from four period photographic replicas, can hardly be coincidental. The principal standing female figure in Santa conversazione is the sort of lifelike educational mannequin made for human biology classrooms, with body sections that can be removed to reveal internal organs. With the skin layer removed from the anatomical model 's lower right leg, she looks like an amputee twin to the Man Ray female figure in Coat Stand. Considering the image of a dove that Ernst added as a collage element to cover( partly) the crotch of the figure in Santa conversazione, he probably had access to a copy of New York Dada illustrating the Man Ray collage image with the postage stamp as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ernst and Man Ray were on exactly the same Dada page by the end of 1921. And Ernst treated the subject of a nude with one problem lower leg in another work, one of the eleven collages chosen by Paul Eluard during the course of his visit to Cologne in November 1921 to bring back to Paris to be reproduced for Rptitions, his brilliant 1922 volume of verse.( This one appeared in the D.C. show.) Lacking its head, the female figure in this collage has the distinction of being the first of Ernst 's signature Surrealist images of headless women, developed after he settled in Paris. The surprise is that Man Ray is not among the Paris Dada personalities included inAu rendez-vous des amis( 1922), Ernst 's ambitious group portrait of leading Dada personalities, painted after he arrived in the French capital. After all, the nocturnal glacier background in Au rendez-vous des amis could be understood as a response to the startling Rayograph images that Man Ray had published so successfully as a portfolio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ray, Tzara, Picabia and Duchamp are all likewise missing in Ernst 's Dada group portrait. Their combined absence is symptomatic of the final Dada irony, that just as the far-flung members of the group began to assemble in Paris with the prospect of a stronger-than-ever Dada, interest in the movement dissipated rather quickly instead. Did Washington politics have anything to do with the end of Dada, as it had contributed to the movement 's outset? seemingly so. With the passage of the National Prohibition Act in October 1919, New York ceased to be a magnet for artists. Alcohol-addicted European talents like Picabia never returned, and such leading international-minded American visual artists as Man Ray had little choice but to emigrate. With his most ambitious work, the ultra-fragile Large Glass, under way in New York, Duchamp found himself somewhat obliged to remain, but in February 1920 he wrote to one of his paramours, Yvonne Chastel, " One does n't drink here any more and it 's quiet, too quiet. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision to leave his ambitious project definitively unfinished, with the result that he was free to spend less time in New York and more time in Paris. Rather than venture into the polemics of Surrealism, Duchamp would henceforth devote himself fanatically to the reproduction in facsimile of his pre-Prohibition notes and drawings, published as the so-called " Green Box " in 1934, and then to the replication in miniature of his paintings and objects as the so-called Bote en valise, finished in New York in 1941, where he had returned to avoid the nightmares of World War II. It seems fair to say that Duchamp 's uninterrupted devotion to the movement 's original replica spirit provided a great deal of the impetus for the creation, during the 1950s and 1960s of modern version of classic Dada works. Without these replicas the current exhibition would of necessity be full of holes. Photograph Max Ernst : Au Rendez-vous des Amis( At the Rendezvous of Friends), 1922, oil on canvas, 51 by 76 inches.

In her recent show at Paula Cooper Gallery in New York, Levine included replicas she had created of two Man Ray photographs on view in the National Gallery " Dada " show, photographs which are themselves documentations of the lost originals. As Dada as can be, the American correspondence-art master Ray Johnson put it best, in 1972, when he meditated in a nearly empty room. His only dcor was an address label on which he had printed : " Dada is never right. " From my own conversations with the artist, I would venture that he left the all too obvious unsaid : " Even so, Dada is still better than the next best thing.

Considering how Duchamp 's patrons Louise and Walter Arensberg acquired the great majority of his works at this time, the fact that Fountain failed to survive raises the possibility that the artist had little, if any. interest in its preservation, at least not until 1950, when he created the first of an eventual 15 fullsize replica versions for exhibition and market opportunities. One wonders what, if anything, is to be made of the fact that the Arensbergs acquired only three of Duchamp 's so-called readymades during the World War I years. 10. Francis M.

Most famously, Man Ray 's Puriculture( 1921), first replicated in 1937, was based directly on an Ernst collage in the collection of Tzara : Armada v. Duldgedalzen, 1919( Spies, no. 300).

There is scarcely any information about which Man Ray works were on view in that 1921 exhibition, however, so it may never be possible to know whether it was reproduced works by the American artist that prompted Ernst to utilize photographs as enlarged replica images for the circulation of some of his best known Dada pieces. Quite possibly Ernst had already reached the decision on his OWTI to make such photographic reproductions, but it is worth noting that he did not include any in the solo exhibition of his Dada works that opened in May 1921 in Paris, while he remained in Germany. Not included in Ernst 's 1921 Paris catalogue, Sonia conversazione perhaps should be dated to the latter part of the same year. 22.
