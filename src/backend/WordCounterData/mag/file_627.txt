An easier alternative is to add the leaves directly to your garden in fall, says Abigail Maynard, associate agricultural scientist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, who has studied the use of leaves as a garden soil amendment for more than 10 years. # If possible, shred your leaves first with a chipper-shredder or mower ; the smaller pieces will break down faster.
