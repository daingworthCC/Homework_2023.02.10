2020341 Section : YOUNG SKIN FOR LIFE <p> How to make sure you 're getting maximum protection with minimum bother <p> As summer arrives, you probably want to do two things :( 1) enjoy outdoor activities, and( 2) protect your skin against cancer and premature photoaging caused by sun exposure. But can you really do both? <p> Yes -- because of today 's sun- shielding products. But a lot of factors can influence how effective -- or ineffective -- these products are. Here 's how to use them for maximum effect. <p> The two basic types of sun protection are sunblocks and sunscreens. Traditionally, a block gives top-notch protection because it 's a compound with the consistency of paste -- frequently titanium dioxide or zinc or iron oxide -- which actually reflects the harmful ultraviolet rays away from the skin. <p> This offers maximum protection but is also very thick( like the white goop on a lifeguard 's nose) and not the type of product you could easily get used to using all over, every day. Still, a sunblock can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nose, under the eyes or the tops of your ears( if your hair does n't cover them). A sunscreen does n't reflect the sun but instead works like melanin, which is your skin 's natural defense system, to absorb harmful ultraviolet rays before they can damage your skin cells. <p> Because they 're absorbed into your skin rather than sitting on top of it, sunscreens are more cosmetically acceptable. They 're available in various consistencies including lotions, oils, creams and sprays. <p> The basic sunscreening agent is the chemical para-aminobenzoic acid( PABA). PABA is very effective against the sun 's burning ultraviolet-B rays( those that contribute most directly to skin cancer) and also provides minimal protection against ultraviolet-A rays. However, it can cause an allergic reaction in some people and may also stain fabrics. <p> For these reasons, most sunscreens today use derivatives of PABA that are gentler to the skin and clothes. PABA and its derivatives protect primarily against the UV-B rays and offer less protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be harmless, penetrate deeply and cause underlying damage that is responsible for much of the premature wrinkling that your skin undergoes. To get the best protection, opt for a sunscreen that contains benzophenones, which screen out some of the UV-A rays. THE NUMBERS GAME <p> The SPF number on a sunscreen tells you how much longer the sunscreen will let you be exposed to sunlight without your getting sunburn, compared to your reddening time when not using the sunscreen. For instance, an SPF of 15 lets you stay out 15 times longer than you could without it.( The SPF numbers pertain to protection from UV-B rays only ; there is no established standard of measurement for UV-A protection.) <p> The SPF number on the label refers to the protective value the sunscreen had when it was tested under controlled laboratory conditions. This means, among other things, that the SPF numbers are based on the use of considerably more sunscreen than most of us would apply at one time. Also, heat, humidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There 's a common misunderstanding that by reapplying a sunscreen you double its protection. Not true. Reapplying an SPF 15 brings your protection back to the original 15 ; it does not give you the protection of a 30. <p> A few years ago, 15 was the highest SPF you could buy. " Under ideal conditions this would be protection enough for just about everyone, " says Prevention advisor Norman Levine, M.D., chief of dermatology, University of Arizona Health Sciences Center. " But many things -- from sweating to rubbing -- can compromise the amount of sunscreen actually at work. <p> " Because many people do n't really know how long it takes before they start to redden and also because we do n't use sunscreens under laboratory conditions, I recommend a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15. " <p> Sunscreens are now available in multiples into the 40s ; however there 's some debate about whether such high SPFs are necessary. " An SPF of more than 15 might be indicated if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day in the direct sun, " recommends Dr. Levine. " For most instances an SPF 15 is fine. If you 're in doubt, give yourself the extra protection. " <p> One of the main qualities a sunscreen is tested for is " substantivity, " which means how well it stays on and continues giving you the SPF on the label. <p> Even the highest SPF ca n't help if it washes away. " Even though you 're not planning on swimming, it makes sense to choose a waterproof or water-resistant product, " says Dr. Levine. Sweat is water, and a waterproof sunscreen will stay on better, in general. USING IT RIGHT <p> Take advantage of the diverse types of sunscreen base available. " Choose your sunscreen the way you choose a moisturizer, " suggests Dr. Levine. " If you have oily skin there are products with a gel or alcohol base that wo n't contribute to the problem. " <p> Apply sunscreen at least 30 minutes before you go out. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's important because it takes your skin this long to absorb the protective chemicals to the level at which they 'll be effective. <p> Reapply sunscreen after swimming -- even if the sunscreen is waterproof. While the water itself may not wash the protection away, most of us towel off when we come out, and even the best sunscreen can use a boost then. <p> Use your sunscreen all the time -- not just when you 're planning to be outside. UV-A rays can penetrate glass, so that even in your car or sitting indoors in a sunny spot, you 're exposed to them. UV-A is also present all day all year long, unlike UV-B, which is much more intense in the summer. <p> Be especially protective of your skin... Between the hours of 10 and 3 when the UV-B rays are at their most intense. When you 're at high elevations. The higher above sea level you are, the less radiation is blocked out by the atmosphere. When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coolness, but water reflects the rays back onto your skin. <p> By Pamela Boyer <p> WHAT YOUR LABEL IS TRYING TO TELL YOU <p> SPF 15 Means a Sun Protection Factor of 15. If you normally start to turn pink in half an hour, you can stay out for 15 times that long or 7 1/2 hours with an SPF-15 sunscreen. <p> BROAD SPECTRUM Means that this product contains ingredients that will give some protection against both UV-A and UV-B rays. <p> WATERPROOF Means that you 're protected at the SPF value even after four 20-minute swims. " Water-resistant " means the protection lasts through two 20-minute swims. <p> PABA-FREE If you 're sensitive to PABA and its derivatives, you can turn to sunscreens that use chemicals such as cinnamates, salicylates and/or benzophenones as sunscreening agents. <p> Expiration date is also listed on some sunscreens to be sure the active ingredients are functioning at the stated SPF. <p>
