2038441 Section : Science &; Ideas Television America gets the TV show it deserves ; Regis Philbin rules <p> Lauren Kelner did n't think she wanted to be a millionaire. <p> Yes, she 'd watched the new TV show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire -- has n't everyone? -- and sure, it was good money, but she just could n't be bothered to call in. " Who 's got time to sit there on the phone? " Her 11-year-old son, Harrison, thought otherwise : He knew his mom could win. So when it was announced that the show was being extended for three more episodes, he began calling ABC 's toll-free contestant hotline. When he eventually got through, he put his mother on the phone, and, as predicted, the Plymouth, Minn., clinical laboratory scientist easily nailed the first round. <p> Then she won again. And again. And then last Wednesday, there was Lauren Kelner on ABC picking up $125,000 after advancing to the final round in the biggest thing to hit prime-time television since " Who Shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its second run last week, it had averaged 23.8 million viewers a night, creaming the competition. It had awarded more than $5 million, including $1 million to one lucky contestant, the largest single game-show prize in television history. And it had accomplished the impossible, reviving the moribund game-show genre and giving a much-needed boost to ABC. The network is planning to bring the show back again early in 2000 ; Fox has already rushed on to the air Greed, a sleazy copycat. Several other game shows are now in the works, including a revived Twenty-One, to be honchoed by veteran TV producer Fred Silverman. <p> Hosted by kibitzer supreme Regis Philbin, Millionaire became a national phenomenon in the blink of an eye. Suddenly everyone was talking about it, from David Letterman( who kept repeating its catch phrase, " Is that your final answer? ") to the pundits on Washington Week in Review, who puzzled over its social meaning. <p> But although the program reminded some of the golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikingly different from its forebears, in style and content. What it tests is not deep knowledge but a strange mix of what kids usually learn in school -- facts like state capitals, say, or the world 's tallest mountains -- and what they really learn at home -- sitcom chronology, movie titles, music hits ; the kind of knowledge found on circa-1970s lunch boxes, in children 's almanacs, or on episodes of VH1 's Where Are They Now? <p> At the same time, however, critics of the show 's less-than-Mensa sensibility ignored the fact that apart from, perhaps Cops, Millionaire is the one show on network television that shows ordinary Americans -- for better or for worse. <p> So here 's the $64 question : What 's wrong with Millionaire? <p> Answer No. 1. It came from England. <p> Like tabloid editors and the Spice Girls, it moved across the Atlantic not stealthily but with great fanfare. Millionaire is in fact just the most recent import in a history of TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least as far as All in the Family, and including, more recently, Men Behaving Badly. <p> Millionaire was a big hit for Britain 's ITV, though it faced tough criticism in the papers there( the Guardian : " There is now more creativity in the average primary school art class than in a month of programming on ITV "). Although England 's Chris Tarrant is a less saccharine host than Philbin, the pseudo-futuristic set and most other details are virtually the same. Contestants who make it to the final round are asked a series of multiple-choice questions, ranging from the painfully simple( " What animal is covered with sharp quills? ") to the blandly esoteric( " Put the following Bruce Willis movies in the order of their theatrical release "). If a contestant needs help, he or she can use one of three " lifelines " : There 's one chance to phone a friend for help, one chance to ask the audience what it thinks, and one " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Qualifying for the show is a complex process. Aspiring contestants call in to a special toll-free phone line. If they get through -- and for days it seemed as though no one could -- they then must answer a series of three questions, by pressing the correct buttons on their phone within 10 seconds. After two further rounds of random selection and quiz questions, 12 people per show are flown to New York City. <p> Once on the show, contestants engage in " fastest finger " competitions, where they compete to be the first to punch in the correct answer. The winner advances to the final round for a chance at the $1 million. Sitting in the " hot seat " in front of a console( many of them slouching just like they might on the sofa or in front of the computer at home), they face Regis one on one, answering a possible 15 questions on the way to the million-dollar jackpot. <p> The show cultivates a " regular folks " aesthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are chosen entirely by random once they have answered questions correctly, they are n't screened for appearance or diversity. " The contestants all seem very real and interesting, " says Tom Galloway, 38, a technical course developer from Mountain View, Calif., who appeared on Greed but also calls himself a fan of Millionaire, " even if they are n't necessarily as photogenic as on some shows or are a bit awkward in front of an audience or camera. " <p> " They made it more than clear how important the contestants were, " says Kelner. " That the show is n't about Regis, it 's about the people that are on the show, and that 's why everyone wants to watch it. " <p> Who are " real people? " " I think the success of the show has almost nothing to do with the money whatsoever, " says Michael Davies, the Scottish-born executive producer of Millionaire. " The million dollars is just a great hook. What works about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no real people on television apart from this show. " <p> That success has not only made a phenom out of Millionaire, it has virtually ensured the network owned by the Walt Disney Co. its first sweeps victory since 1994 -- something to brag about, if nothing else, after several seasons in the dumper.( Sweeps, the twice-yearly network stunting marathon, determines how local ad rates are set but has no impact on national rates.) Overall, ABC 's prime-time viewership in the all-important 18-to-49 age range is up 24 percent from last year at this time, thanks to Millionaire.( An estimated 21 million viewers watched Philbin dole out the first $1 million prize.) More important, viewers were n't just watching the quiz show, which instantly became " appointment television, " but tuned in early and stuck around to watch ABC 's other shows, exhibiting the most prized behavior in the network world : spillover. Audiences for shows like The Drew Carey Show and The Practice, which precede and follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a million worth? In the film Austin Powers : International Man of Mystery, a supervillain named Dr. Evil is thawed out after 30 years. His demands are as outdated as Powers 's sexual politics : " One million dollars, " he declares, as ominously as any James Bond baddie circa 1967. <p> The joke, of course, is that $1 million does n't buy you a lot of supervillainous superweapons these days. A corollary is that being a millionaire is n't even all that special. A poll last year found that over a third of 18-to-29-year-olds fully expect to be millionaires in their lifetime ; about 1 out of every 20 American households already has " millionaire " status. E-trading, day trading, getting in on the ground floor of IPOs -- American culture may be even more about instant riches today than at any time in its long strike-it-rich history. <p> Still, a million is a nice chunk of change. On Jeopardy!, for example, " I would have had to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Champions, and won it to win the same amount of money, " notes Jane Oviatt of Wheaton, Ill., who nabbed $125,000 on Millionaire. <p> The show 's appeal, says Jake Tanner, 34, a Millionaire fan from San Francisco, also stems from the speed of winning. " It 's the money, but I think it 's also the immediacy of it all, " he says. " You call that number, and from the minute you qualify, you air within one week. What are the chances of your life changing that much, that quick? " <p> But perhaps even more than the compulsive day trader, Millionaire redeems the video-game junkie. To be eligible to be selected for the show, contestants had to be quick on their phone keypad ; the " fastest finger " round, too, depends in large part on " finger speed "( a new sports statistic coined by the show 's creators). " I do n't think it 's a question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you just have to be able to think fast in order to qualify. " <p> Who is the biggest winner? The most improbable development has been the transformation of Regis Philbin into a folk hero. " Reege " is n't the butt of jokes like his morning co-star Kathie Lee Gifford ; instead, he has become our national avuncular enabler, shepherding contestants( and viewers, by proxy) through the emotional ups and downs of the winning process. Unlike Chris Tarrant, the British show 's host, " Philbin is very much on the side of the contestant, " says Davies.( Tarrant, on the other hand, " will absolutely torture them. ") <p> Philbin was already famous for being famous in 1972 when he played himself as a game-show panelist in the Woody Allen film Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex.( The What 's My Line takeoff, hosted by real-live game-show host Jack Barry, was called " What 's My Perversion? " ; Philbin and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who turned out to be a flasher.) He got more exposure in 1988, when Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee went national. His shtick on that show is exasperated curmudgeon, but on Millionaire he is much more the gently sarcastic nice guy. Which is the other overriding ethos of the show. " Everyone involved was so nice, " says Kelner, echoing other contestants. Steven D. Stark, author of Glued to the Set, says this is what makes the show different. " It 's been Oprah-cized for the ' 90s. First of all, you do n't have to climb over anybody to win. Second, it 's communal in the sense that you can call on the audience or a friend to help you out. So it 's kind of a kinder, gentler quiz show. " <p> That 's made the show 's only millionaire, the extremely confident John Carpenter, stand out. He has been excoriated in online newsgroups for his seeming arrogance and celebrated with a guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It sounds arrogant, " he admits, " but... I knew if I did get on and I did manage to get up in the ' hot seat ' I thought I would win pretty easily. " <p> Who knows? Four decades ago, quiz show guests included a Marine Corps officer with an encyclopedic knowledge of cookery and a jockey who could tell you everything about fine art( box, Page 72). Today the audience cheers contestants who stumble over questions like " Which of the following foods do you have to ' shuck ' before eating?( A) Guava.( B) Zucchini.( C) Oysters.( D) Carrots. " Regis himself baldly mispronounced Sacagawea, the face on the new dollar coin( " You should get the whole million just for pronouncing it correctly! " he told the contestant, who got it right). In another show, he expressed amazement that anyone could learn calculus, let alone teach it. Many viewers initially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the early rounds -- but this is precisely what makes the show popular -- the feeling on the part of most viewers that " I could do that! " <p> " We focus too much on the difficulty level of questions, " says Alfie Kohn, author of the new book The Schools Our Children Deserve, " as opposed to the confusion of intelligence with merely having a storehouse of knowledge. " Kohn sees criticism of the show as part of a greater trend toward standardized testing. " That 's fine for a quiz show, but what I fear is that this is our notion of what schools should be : lists of what every child should know. " <p> Davies 's next project should satisfy those looking for tougher material, however : He wants to bring over another British quiz show, the long-running Mastermind series, a much more difficult contest that he terms the 60 Minutes of game shows. " It wo n't be as successful, " he concedes. <p> PHOTOS( COLOR) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Regis and Kathie Lee congratulate million-dollar winner John Carpenter. <p> PHOTOS( COLOR) : They may be smooth, but they 're no Regis Philbin : game-show hosts Alex Trebek of Jeopardy!, Chuck Woolery of the new show Greed, and Pat Sajak of Wheel of Fortune. <p> PHOTO( COLOR) : Lauren Kelner owes a lot to her son, Harrison, who pushed her to go on the show. <p> By Sara Sklaroff <p> With Margaret Loftus ; Brendan I.
