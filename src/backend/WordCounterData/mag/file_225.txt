2027241 Section : THE PUBLIC POLICY The pharmaceutical " crisis " is a Washington invention. <p> Presidential election years are good for political consultants and bad for the rest of us, who bear the brunt of the usual policy " reforms " emanating from Washington, D.C. So it is this year with pharmaceuticals. <p> Concern about the nation 's rising prescription drug bill has set off the usual flurry in the nation 's capital. Unfortunately, the tenor of the " debate " is reflected in the presidential campaign. Vice President Al Gore turned from attacking " Big Oil " to trashing drug makers. The industry, he claimed, is " gouging the consumer " and engaging in " corporate chutzpah. " But, he proudly proclaimed, " I have taken on the pharmaceutical companies for nearly a quarter century now. " <p> Congress is consumed by similar maneuvering for political advantage. The result is awful policy on both sides. Conservative Republicans on Capitol Hill readily admit that the competing legislation is shaped more by polls than facts : The GOP proposal " is damage control, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You hope this bill stops you from getting killed politically. " <p> The biggest complaint about prescription drugs is their cost, even though Americans devote more money to alcohol and almost as much to tobacco. Last year overall pharmaceutical spending increased by 17.4 percent, creating the perception of runaway prices -- and corresponding political pressure for government action. <p> But that increase is in total outlays, not average prices. The primary reasons the former increased, points out Laura Dummit of the General Accounting Office, are growth in pharmaceutical coverage by private insurance plans, the number of new drugs entering the market, and overall consumption. Drug prices have increased less swiftly, and even those estimates are flawed ; they reflect sampling problems, fail to account for the increased role of generics, and ignore falling prices for newer medicines and improved drug quality. <p> A related criticism is that drugs cost more in the U.S. than in other countries. Politicians have organized well-publicized bus trips to Canada to allow constituents to purchase pharmaceuticals at lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost too much in this nation, " claims Sen. Jim Jeffords( R-Vermont). <p> However, prices overseas generally reflect the relative poverty of some states and the highly politicized nature of most foreign health care systems. Moreover, despite the highly publicized anomalies, controls save little money. In the most detailed analysis available( using 1992 data), researchers Patricia Danzon and Jeong Kim report " that the average U.S. consumer would have paid 3 percent more in Canada, 27 percent more in Germany, 30 percent less in France, 9 percent less in Italy, 8 percent less in Japan, 44 percent more in Switzerland, 9 percent more in Sweden, and 24 percent less in the UK. " <p> Other governments can hold down prices only by wrecking their pharmaceutical markets ; U.S. firms become their escape valve. As Bill McArthur, a physician with Canada 's Fraser Institute, admits : " In effect, Canada must steal U.S. research and development to maintain itself. " But if Washington responded by similarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their primary incentive to make new products : Unless someone pays for the development of drugs, no one will develop them. <p> Unfortunately, though drugs generate enormous benefits, they do not come cheap. U.S. pharmaceutical firms will spend about $26.4 billion on research and development this year alone. Critics complain that companies devote even more money to administration and marketing, but as a share of sales, drug makers put more into R &D; than does the medical industry generally, or companies that produce computer software, electronics, automobiles, or military hardware. Anyway, price controls would actually create a greater incentive to sell more of existing products and create fewer new ones. <p> The industry figures it costs on average more than a half billion dollars to produce each successful drug. Companies generally winnow 5,000 to 10,000 potential substances down to just one marketable drug. And 70 percent of drugs sold are estimated to lose money. <p> Drug development is never likely to be cheap. But unnecessarily strict regulation by the FDA makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as double the cost of new drug development. Despite recent reforms, a Competitive Enterprise Institute poll found that huge majorities of doctors( including 77 percent of oncologists) believed the agency was still too slow in approving new products, and that strong majorities believed Americans were dying as a result. <p> Political pressure to act on drug prices largely emanates from the elderly, since Medicare generally does not cover pharmaceuticals. One congressional proposal would allow importation of U.S.-produced drugs from other countries ; another would forbid any company from selling drugs for different prices anywhere in the world. Both measures would effectively subject American firms to price controls imposed by overseas governments. <p> But debate so far has focused on adding a drug benefit to Medicare. The administration( including candidate Al Gore) and the GOP Congress( but not candidate George W. Bush) have offered plans with ten-year costs of $253 billion and $155 billion, respectively. These proposals, complains Rep. Mark Sanford, " represent a bidding war for votes. " <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansion of social programs is that party 's constant goal. Far more uncomfortable are many Republicans. One press secretary explained to me in detail how pleased his conservative boss was with the GOP proposal, sentiments those who have talked with other members of the congressman 's staff know to be false. Most GOP staffers and legislators simply refuse to go on the record. <p> In fact, there 's no crisis. According to analysts William Orzechowski and Robert Walker, 70 percent of the elderly spend less than $500 a year on pharmaceuticals ; only about four percent spend more than $2,000 a year. Many of them are not needy and more than two-thirds of seniors have some coverage for prescription drugs. <p> Moreover, the congressional proposals have numerous holes. The Democrats intend to rely upon pharmaceutical benefit management programs, which have not prevented sharp prescription drug price increases for HMOs. The Democratic initiative would also encourage seniors to abandon private pharmaceutical coverage. The plan offers first-dollar coverage( no deductible), but with a total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The measure appears to be preeminently political : offer universal coverage, to hook all seniors on government assistance, with miserly benefits, low enough to keep initial budget estimates down but that could be easily expanded in the future. <p> Alas, the GOP 's stand-alone drug benefit risks " adverse selection " ; that is, those who use the most medications would be most likely to take the coverage. In addition, unlike under normal health insurance policies, increased drug expenses could not be counterbalanced by reductions in other treatment costs. Indeed, some Republicans are scathing in private. The GOP proposal " is not based on reality, " complained one staffer. Another said : " Will it ever work in real life? No. " A leading conservative congressman denounced " the plan as designed in Oz. " Its dubious assumptions, he said, " were just flat out wishful thinking. " <p> Like all government health programs, a new drug benefit would inflate demand and thus spending. As costs rose, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the Comptroller General has testified that price controls would be necessary to maintain the solvency of any drug benefit program. <p> The administration has formally rejected such restrictions, but it has criticized the industry for high prices and threatened to push restrictions if its proposal is defeated ; it also proposed, and then dropped, under legislative pressure, a plan to cut Medicare reimbursement for cancer drugs( a limited exception to the lack of any drug benefit). <p> In fact, both Medicaid and Medicare were originally fee-for-service plans to which price controls were later added. And the federal government already regulates some drug prices. In 1990 Congress set up the Federal Supply Schedule( FSS), which mandates a discount of at least 15 percent, up to the best price offered any private purchaser, for non-Medicare federal health care programs. As a result, industry discounts to other buyers fell substantially : Legislators shifted rather than cut costs. <p> Nevertheless, pending legislation would mandate that drug makers extend to Medicare recipients the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FSS. But the FSS works because it remains limited ; expanding it to Medicare would increase firms ' revenue loss, making them more reluctant to participate in FSS. Drug makers would also become more hesitant to grant any discounts to any purchaser. <p> Medicaid, which effectively imposes price controls through FSS, also uses formularies to regulate use. On average it takes 20 months after FDA approval for a pharmaceutical to be added to the Medicaid formulary. Less than half of new drugs are made available to Medicaid recipients during the first four years. Similar problems afflict Veterans Administration patients. <p> Unfortunately, states are also beginning to play the price control game. In May, Maine passed complicated legislation to roll back drug prices. Several other states are considering similar laws. <p> The potential for disaster is clear. If the federal or state governments had tightly controlled prices, profits, and use of pharmaceuticals in the 1980 's, numerous breakthrough drugs would never have been developed, limiting the treatment of everything from cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owe their lives to profit-making drug firms. <p> Rising pharmaceutical prices pose a problem, but one largely limited to the very small number of people who earn little but spend much. They should receive aid ; Washington, D.C. is not, however, the place to start. For instance, in 1998 drug makers gave away 2.8 million prescriptions worth an estimated $500 million. And as the American Legislative Exchange Council points out in a new study, more than 20 states already have senior pharmaceutical assistance programs designed to help the indigent elderly. <p> Private Medigap coverage, too, could better meet this need if the federal government did not require policies to reimburse routine expenditures. For the same amount of money, existing policies could be reconfigured to provide the benefits that Medicare recipients most need. Finally, as the Institute for Policy Innovation points out, the federal government could help everyone by loosening FDA control of pharmaceutical development, thereby reducing costs. <p> As for the elderly, Washington should cover pharmaceuticals as part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George W. Bush. Rep. William Thomas( R-Calif.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, and Democratic Sen. John Breaux of Louisiana led a majority of members of the Commission on Medicare Reform in proposing to allow beneficiaries to choose among competing plans. Providing Medicare vouchers to the elderly would allow them to select coverage that included a prescription benefit, while avoiding the problem of adverse selection. One conservative staffer acknowledges that " we should be pushing for Breaux-Thomas, " since any stand-alone plan would be a second-best solution. <p> But that was never going to happen this year. Complained another GOP congressional aide : " I guess the attitude now is let 's punt till the next Congress. Then President Bush and a Republican Congress can deal with it. " Which, of course, assumes a President Bush and GOP Congress. <p> Economic prosperity, scientific discovery, and technological innovation have all combined in the form of pharmaceuticals to offer new hope for the sick. Congress should follow the injunction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would yield little financial relief for consumers or the government, but would deny everyone the medicines that have done so much to save and improve lives. <p> Admittedly, standing for principle could prove politically costly. But a GOP unwilling to fight for anything is unworthy of reelection ; as one Republican staffer observed, " being Clinton-lite does n't make it a better idea. " As tempting as it might be for Congress to adopt a quick-fix measure, ill-considered action today would generate counterproductive consequences for Americans for years to come. <p> By Doug Bandow <p> <p> Doug Bandow is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute <p> <p>
