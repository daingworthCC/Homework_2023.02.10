4146441 Section : SAMPLINGS # Wolf-Rayets are some of the fiercest stars the universe has to offer. They 're big, more than twenty times the Sun 's mass ; they 're hot, with surfaces up to 90,000 degrees Fahrenheit ; and, to boot, they blow out hellish, gaseous winds at over five million miles per hour. Those gases veil the stars that emit them, making Wolf-Rayet stars all the more difficult to study. An open question about the fate of Wolf-Rayets is, do they turn into supernovae when they die, exploding like other stellar behemoths? Or do they collapse into black holes? # Researchers led by astrophysicist Avishay Gal-Yam of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, might now have an answer. Last May, the Intermediate Palomar Transient Factory( iPTF) -- an automated survey that scans large portions of the sky for cosmic ephemera-snagged a likely Wolf-Rayet just hours after it went bang. # Upon noticing a sudden brightness in the constellation Botes with iPTF, the scientists scrambled to focus other telescopes on the event. Using flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical composition of a new supernova 's progenitor star -- the Keck-II telescope in Hawaii recorded the element signatures imprinted in the bright, streaming light. The recorded spectrum, crucially obtained only fifteen and a half hours after the event started, ended up matching that of the telltale shroud of gases hurled off by Wolf-Rayet stars. More spectra obtained in the following hours and days showed that the event indeed was evolving into a so-called type IIb supernova, characterized by strong helium but weak hydrogen signatures. # What had happened, the scientists reason, is that the initial shock of the supernova ionized and lit up the gases previously ejected by the Wolf-Rayet star. As days passed, the outrush of material from the supernova explosion itself overtook those ejected gases. Typically, the supernova deaths of Wolf-Rayet stars are not seen early enough : debris quickly swamps out the stars ' distinctive veil of gases, so that telescopes only perceive a Type lib supernova, and the progenitor star remains unclassified. # TABLE # The technique of flash spectroscopy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by disclosing the contents of their gases pre-supernova.
