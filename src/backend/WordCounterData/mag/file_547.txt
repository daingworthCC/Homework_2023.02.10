4110141 Gear <p> A high-tech chronograph in a simpleto- use package <p> The moment I heard the rumor at last year 's NRA show that Ken Oehler was again selling his Model 35P chronograph system, I politely excused myself from the meeting I was in and hurried over to his booth to get my name on the already growing wait list. <p> Oehler 's chronographs are as good as they are scarce, so I did n't want to risk missing out on his latest run. As it turns out, I need not have worried. Oehler, working in partnership with Gary Stafford, has ramped up production to meet general demand. <p> Consistency : The kit arrived at my house in its Plano gun case a couple of months later, and I soon had it out at my local gun range, where it performed flawlessly. Oehler packs a lot of technology into his chronographs ; if we had the space here I could go on about it, but that 's really beside the point. <p> All you need to know about the 35P is that it works-meaning that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot, regardless of the conditions. Other chronograph models-and I 've used a pile of them over the years-have a hard time matching the consistency of Oehler 's units. <p> Ease of Use : The 35P has the additional benefit of being simple to use. It does n't even have an on/off button. The unit powers up when you plug in the cords from the sky screens. Just stick the cords into the correct sockets in the main unit, and the chronograph is up and running. Even the most addle-brained shooter can figure it out. <p> The kit comes with the printer unit, three sky screens and an adjustable folding stand with mounting rail, and is ready to go right out of the box.( $575 ; oehler-research.com)
