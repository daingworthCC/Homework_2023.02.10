4179441 <p> I 'm not surprised this happened. I 'm not even surprised that there 's a photo of it. This is actually one of the more charming tales we 've heard. But I am slightly surprised that there are still Suicide Squad set stories to tell. <p> Advertisement <p> Conan O'Brien asked Jai Courtney if it was true that he chased director David Ayer around while he was naked. And Courtney said it was. " He came into my trailer one day and I must not have had any clothes, " Courtney explained. <p> " He comes in, and look, I 'm an impulsive dude. I just kind of went after him. And Jay Hernandez, who plays Diablo in the movie, I could hear behind me saying ' Sic ' em, boy, ' " said Courtney. " And it just... you know you got ta go with one of these things. " <p> " I 'm just wondering who 've I got ta kill now for dropping that, " joked Courtney after the photo of him naked and chasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt on that crew, " he continued. " I 'm happy to be the fall guy for the shenanigans. " <p> What more dirt could he have? No, seriously, how could there still be untold stories of weird-ass shit happening on the Suicide Squad set? We already have enough to fill a book, what does Courtney have left to spill? You know what, I do n't want to know. Naked chases are cute and all, but the next secret story is going to be, like, a felony. I know it.
