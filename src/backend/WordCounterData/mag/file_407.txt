4027941 KOREANS CAPITALIZE ON BLACK BEAUTY 'S BIG BUSINESS // THE HAIR IS EVERYWHERE Bags and bags and yet more bags of the silky, stringy stuff line the walls of the beauty supply store. Beneath the bags of hair are bottles of shampoo and conditioner, sparkly cell phone chargers and rose-smelling lotions. All told, an estimated 2,000 different items line the shelves of this smallish store situated between the bus stop and the candy shop on 47th Street in Chicago. The Korean-born owner shrugs off any further conversation, but it 's clear - from the sheer numbers of customers lining the aisles and flipping through packages of $34 hair - that he is sitting on a gold mine. And he 's not the only one. Beauty supply store owners and industry insiders say there are about 9,000 Korean-owned beauty supply stores in the United States. Many of them are concentrated in urban centers around the country. History teaches us that Koreans, many who are now second-generation Americans, started their businesses in the Black community in the 1970s and ' 80s by selling wigs, then weaves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their businesses were handed down father to son, mother to daughter. Black folks, in turn, keep them in business. We spend between an estimated $1.8 billion to $15 billion a year getting those kinks relaxed, adding length and keeping that hairline razor-sharp. The flip side is that not too many of us actually own the stores where we shop. Even fewer of us manufacture or distribute the goods. It 's an odd world that has seemingly made everybody but a handful of Black people rich. The conspiracy theorists among us believe the government somehow favors non-Black immigrants with loans and special business favors. The naysayers among us say Black folks are just lazy and do n't want to own their own businesses. At least one movie documentary says it 's a deliberate Asiatic takeover that is being fought at every turn by Black entrepreneurs trying to get a solid piece of the pie. If it is a takeover, Black folks are not unwitting witnesses they 're enablers. Just ask any Korean storeowner. They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other American business, race matters little when there 's money to be made. FROM SOUTH KOREA TO THE SOUTH SIDE " Koreans are naturally talented entrepreneurs, " explains Philip Kim, 41, a co-owner of Mid-K Beauty Supply, a Chicago-based company that sells and distributes large quantities of Black hair care products to those mom-and-pop shops in the ' hood. According to industry insiders, Kirn 's company is one of five largest in the nation. It 's also one passed down from father to son. Of the decision to start a beauty supply store, Kim says : " We saw an opportunity. " Kim inherited his business from his dad, who brought the family to the United States in 1981. The South Korean family made the move because the Korean War of 1950 to 1953 left them-along with many other countrymenpoor and destitute as they tried to rebuild their country. Once in the United States, Kim says, Koreans did what every other immigrant does : get in to fit in. Taking a cue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores, they got into the hustle and ran with the idea that a Black woman wants both her cheap styling gel along with some high-end hair conditioner all in one store with various price points. Eddie Jhin, president of Jinny Beauty Supply, has a similar story. Jhin 's dad created the 27-year-old distributing empire, which started out as a Chicago wig shop and grew into a powerhouse serving some 5,200 beauty supply stores across the country. " We were not the pioneers of the beauty supply, " explains Jhin, who encourages his Korean beauty supply customers to give back to their local community. " First it was Blacks and the Jewish and... once they became distributors that left some gaps for Koreans to come in. They saw one Korean doing well and another Korean jumped on, and another. " Anecdotal evidence and those interviewed for this story say Koreans almost exclusively own the bulk of the beauty supply stores in the Black community.( This excludes chains such as Sally Beauty Supply.) Jhin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 percent is Pakistani, Indian, Jewish and European with only a handful of major players being Black. In the 1980s, the first wave of immigrants started by selling wigs, according to members of the American Beauty Supply Retailers Group, which is also known as the Korean Beauty Supply Association. And from there, the whole wide world of Black hair care exploded. " It started out as wig shops with some chemicals in there, " says Melissa Hamilton, president of the retailer 's group. Hamilton, who is Korean, moved to the United States in 1978. " Then business started booming. " Some Koreans began styling Black hair, like Unsuk Kang. She 's owned Mega Hair 2000 for 15 years now, and learned how to do hair 20 years ago after immigrating to the United States from South Korea. Her clientele is 90 percent Black. " When I was young I did a whole bunch of other stuff like waitress, cashier and stuff, but I had to learn something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, of Capitol Heights, Md. As Blacks found more interesting ways to switch up their hairstyles, the beauty supply stores were more than happy to stock the products needed. Of course, most of them bought their products from Korean distributors, thereby keeping all the money in the nationality. One of those distributors is 7-Dollar Beauty Supply of Dallas. For them, says owner Jun Lee, the Jheri curl was the introduction of the glory years and a portent of great things to come. " Business was really good back in the ' 80s and early ' 90s and that 's when you needed the curls, " says Lee, who sells so much product that one of the world 's largest perm manufacturers gave him gift tickets to the 2008 Super Bowl. " People used a lot of activator and men were involved so we had a lot of product we were selling. And the most beautiful thing is they were washing it down the drain. " FADING FROM BLACK TO ASIAN AND WHITE The Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts. One-third of the business lies in the manufacturing of hair products-from perms to shampoos. Another third goes toward the distributors who purchase the shampoo and perm and then sell them to salons and mom-and-pop shops. The last third is spent directly at the beauty supply shops or at the salon. According to market research company Mintel, Blacks make up " only 13 percent of the American population, but account for 30 percent of hair care spending. " Our hunger for hair wares started in the 1880s. Madam C.J. Walker( a Black woman) became the nation 's first self-made female millionaire via popularizing the use of the hot comb to straighten Black hair. Fast forward 100 years, to the 1980s, when many Black-owned, Chicago-based companies became the primary manufacturers of Black hair care products, including relaxers. Many of those old-school companies sold themselves to White companies. Today, only a handful of Black-owned manufacturers and distributors exist, such as the Atlanta-based Bronner Brothers and North Carolina-based Dudley Products Company. Black manufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, L'Oreal and Procter &; Gamble-all companies that tend to advertise heavily to Black audiences. A handful of other manufacturers also do n't fit into the Black-owned business model, such as the ultra-popular Affirm relaxer system, owned by Chicago-based Avion Products, whose president and founder is renowned chemist Ali Syed. " Seriously, right now who does own Black products? " says Jhin, a distributor. " If you say Hawaiian Silky, who owns that? A Pakistani man in Chicago. So when whomever says the Koreans dominate the distribution and we 're not gon na buy Black that 's nonsense because clearly, 90 percent of this market is owned by every race besides African-Americans. " As Mintel says in its most recent report : " This... had led large multinational companies to enter the Black haircare market as they realize the potential of Black purchasing. " So someone 's got to distribute and sell all that perm to the consumer, and that 's where the distributors and mom-and-pop shops come in. Kim, for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of those, he says, most are Korean-owned. And most are in the heart of the Black community, which inevitably leads to racial misunderstandings. RACE BAIT? It 's no secret that Black folks have historically had major beef with non-Blacks who own businesses in Black neighborhoods. The trend has a long history, from the green grocer issues of 1970s New York to the 1990s trend of Asian-owned gas stations in large Midwestern cities. Sometimes tensions get high as storeowners get accused of not caring about the ' hood and folks in the ' hood get accused of inciting racial riots because of perceived mistreatment. Yet, some storeowners and distributors say that-outside of the criminal problems-there are many cultural misunderstandings leading to the disputes. These cultural differences include personal body space issues and how loud we project our voices when we speak to each other. Yet, as storeowners become more familiar with the nuances of American society, the racial problems seem to go away, say owners. " You have cultural conflicts or name-calling, like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country, ' " says Philip Kim. " It really hurts you to the bone... As far as mistreating customers, I think, absolutely, we talk about it. We even criticize each other. " The larger Korean retail associations and trade organizations are trying to counteract these possible cultural misunderstandings by distributing pamphlets on how to communicate with customers and the reasons why they should learn to speak English. Even the Korean-American distributors tell their stores to become more familiar with Black culture and to donate to local football teams and give away turkeys for Thanksgiving. " As a Korean-American, I tell my customers you got ta shape up, " says Jun Lee. " You have to provide good service, good prices and change with the times. " Kang, the Maryland hairdresser, buys most of her products from Ben 's Beauty Supply, also owned by a Korean. She says many of her customers discuss the Korean ownership story, but in the end, they like her services and keep coming back. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is willing to learn, she adds. " I spoke broken English and everything else, " says Kang. " And I said to myself, ' I can do it if you guys can be able to do it too. ' " Hamilton, who also owns a beauty supply store in Waukegan, Ill., says that Koreans do n't necessarily keep Blacks out the game. It 's more of a supply and demand issue, she says. The distributor makes a contract with every store and the distributor agrees to not sell the same products to any store that opens within say, 5 miles of the first store. This way, everybody makes more money with less competition. Of course, if competition does find a way to enter the block, someone-usually the Korean-will lower his or her prices. " If somebody comes next door to me and opens a beauty supply, they 're not gon na get my brands, " says Hamilton. " It does n't matter if they 're Korean or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for so many square miles you ca n't sell. " However, documentary filmmaker Aron Ranen is n't buying it. Ranen 's 2006 DVD, entitled Black Hair : The Korean Takeover Of The Black Hair Care Industry, bills itself as an expos on how Koreans took over the ethnic beauty supply arena and conspire to keep all others out of the business. In the film, which has been viewed at least 250,000 times on YouTube, Ranen suggests that Korean distributors only sell products to Korean stores, thereby canceling out the opportunity for new, and Black, entrepreneurs to sell products. Ranen also suggests that Korean storeowners are not likely to sell products produced by Black companies. " I do n't think people understand the magnitude of this issue, " says Ranen, 46, who is White and originally from the New York area. He decided to make the documentary after hearing a few comments from friends. " This is a global thing. It 's not about the local store. It 's about stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Ranen says, since the largest Black hair care trade magazines are printed in Korean. Also, a quick visit to many Web sites for distributors will show the pages printed in Korean with an option to view in English. While creating the documentary, which was filmed in part in Chicago and California, Ranen came across several Black stylists and other entrepreneurs who felt the situation was unfair. They created the Black Owned Beauty Supply Association, or BOBSA. Ranen now supports the Black Beauty Supply Association, or BBSA, which has about 200 members. " I did n't want to be an activist, but I fell into it because I fell into something that is wrong, " says Ranen, the son of a rabbi. " I just want people to be able to understand the power of buying Black, understand there are billions that could stay in their community and if we all band together in the name of Madam C.J. Walker, we can do this. " TAKING IT BACK TO BLACK Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores that almost exclusively sell products for Black hair. Many say they know who owns what, and wish they could buy Black, but they ca n't. " Black women still go to the Korean shops for the same reason Black people still shop at neighborhood stores not owned by Blacks-most of the time they do not have a choice, " explains Tiffonie Tate, 30, a regular at the aptly named " Beauty Supply, " a store on the corner of Cermak Road and Cicero Avenue on Chicago 's West Side. " For some reason we are always able to find what we need and there is always one close to home. " Birmingham 's Tasha Simone, 31, cosigns on the commentary by refusing to apologize for her spending choices. " Unfortunately I ca n't think of many Black-owned( beauty supplies) in my area, maybe one. And the selection is meager, " says Simone. " Oftentimes because the Asian( stores) are on every block, it tends to become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the Asian store is in the direction that I 'm going, they get my business. " Devin Robinson, who is Black, is an Atlanta entrepreneur who has dedicated himself to solving Simone 's problem. A former beauty supply owner himself, he 's interested in empowering more entrepreneurs and is trying to persuade Black folks to band together to go to Asia and purchase the raw hair that so many of us sew or glue in. He 's currently making the rounds at various hair shows and bookstores with his how-to book entitled Taking it Back : How to Become a Successful Black Beauty Supply Store Owner. In it, he details exactly how a person can find a vacant space, rent it out, purchase supplies and open up a beauty supply store. It 's a fairly simple idea, says Robinson, who has owned several beauty supply stores and salons in the Atlanta area over the years. " I think we have Black people who would get up and actually become an owner, " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dope. Same thing, just a different product. You keep an inventory. You 're a salesperson. It 's just a different product. " Of course, many players in the Black hair care game are already Black. Besides the Luster family, the Dudley family and the Bronner Brothers, all of the members of the American Health and Beauty Aids Institute are Black as well. It 's easy to determine the products of member institutions because the product packaging showcases a small picture of " the proud lady, " which is a Black woman bearing a long mane of rippling hair flowing behind her. This means the products are manufactured by Blackowned companies who provide jobs and scholarships to the community. At least one Korean sits on AHBAI 's advisory board. Everyone-no matter their race-at this point has learned to work together, says Clyde Hammond, president of Summit Laboratories and chairman of AHBAI. Hammond, who is Black, runs a Chicagobased company that produces hair care products. He understands how much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, it would be nice to see more Black owners and distributors. " I wish we could find some African-Americans who would step up and say, I wan na be an entrepreneur, " says Hammond. " We would work to support them and back them.
