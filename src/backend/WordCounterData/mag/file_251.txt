2030341 The Passion shows the power of religious messages, while churchgoing stars open up about their own beliefs // Lord of hosts, send legions of angels to the major media centers of the world, such as Hollywood and New York, to assist in spreading Your message and accomplishing Your will. Granted, it does n't have the lyricism of the 23rd Psalm, but thanks to the ministry of Mastermedia International Inc., which mails out free " Redemptive Prayers for Hollywood " flyers to 50,000 evangelical Christian subscribers, people can pray those words and perhaps move showbiz types to use their considerable influence only for good. The group also offers a Media Leader Prayer Calendar-available online too-so believers can focus their prayers simultaneously on alphabetically designated targets. On April 7, it 's Independence Day director Roland Emmerich. The next day, Eminem. On the 9th, it 's the entire cast and crew of Entertainment Tonight. The calendar reveals what many conservative Christians feel about Hollywood-that it ignores their values. Despite high ratings for Joan of Arcadia on TV, numerous shout-outs to God on awards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up about their religious beliefs, many Americans still feel alienated by the Hollywood studios ' menu of coarse language, rampant sex, gay characters and certain Super Bowl halftime shows. " Hollywood, at heart, is anti-Christian-the only time you see churches are during funerals and weddings, " declares Robert Knight, director of the D.C.-based Culture and Family Institute, who opposes programs like Will &; Grace for " promoting a libertine lifestyle. " Do n't expect the highly rated show suddenly to be replaced by a prime-time edition of The 700 Club. Still, if s not as if Hollywood execs have n't noticed the power of religious-themed projects, thanks to the monumental success of Mel Gibson 's The Passion of the Christ, which has earned an astounding $300 million at the box office so far, defying all expectations. Nearly 45 percent of Americans have either seen the film or say they intend to, according to a March Gallup poll-evidence that the film 's appeal extends far beyond evangelical Christians. Producer Frank Desiderio, who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle in effect when ABC finally aired his long-shelved Judas TV movie last month. Though it fared poorly in the ratings, he says his calls are returned just a little quicker now. He did n't like The Passion for its violence but admits that the film " has raised the profile of my company. We 've always said there are good stories out there. But it has been hard to make them. " Perhaps, but God has long had a high profile in Hollywood. The first version of The Ten Commandments was released in 1923, and stars from Gregory Peck to Jessica Simpson have spoken openly about their faith. Even before the success of The Passion, a crop of new projects with religious themes was in the works. Director Ron Howard is bringing the controversial novel The Da Vinci Code( which suggests that Mary Magdelene bore Jesus ' child) to the big screen. Gladiator director Ridley Scott 's epic Kingdom of Heaven, about the Crusades, is scheduled for next year. Disney plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wardrobe, the Christian parable for kids by C. S. Lewis. Unlike The Passion, though, few big-studio projects deal directly with questions of belief and faith. For years Christian-themed entertainment has been treated as a niche market( see box, page 104), and conservative Christians are easy comic foils.( See Ned Flanders, the " hi-diddily-ho " holier-than-thou neighbor on The Simpsons, for one.) " We 've been screaming for years that Christian folks are a large market looking for a good movie to take their families to see, " says Hank Erwin, an Alabama state senator and Christian broadcaster. " They like movies like anybody else but do n't like to be insulted. " Those in showbiz, not surprisingly, largely disagree with the notion that they 're spiritually bankrupt. " Hollywood is n't a godless place, but the people who run the major entertainment companies are a pretty homogenous group and do n't understand where the rest of the country is, " says producer Gavin Polone( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miniseries based on the Book of Revelation will air on NBC in the fall. Roma Downey, who starred in the 1994-2003 CBS show Touched by an Angel recalls that before her series hit the airwaves " the idea of God and entertainment was decidedly unhip, even within the hallways of my own network. Somehow, it 's like God equals " unfashionable. " And Hollywood is all about how it looks. " Since The Passion hit theaters, however, God is looking pretty good to the studios. " The primary religion practiced in Hollywood is money, " says one exec. " We do not hesitate to worship false idols. If religion sells, we 're going to do it. " Gibson himself has hinted that he will next tell the story of Judah Maccabee, a Jewish warrior ca. 168 BC whose victory is commemorated during Hanukkah. Even Survivor creator Mark Burnett is onboard with Daughter of God, his first feature film, adapted from a novel about a female messiah. " Yes, more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, producer of The Celestine Prophecy, based on the New Age bestseller. " But unless these films are authentic, they will be unsuccessful. Can there be anything emptier than the word of God in the voice of the unbeliever? " As it happens, there are plenty of believers in Hollywood. You can find Denzel Washington and Angela Bassett at a Pentecostal church in South L.A ; Martin Sheen at the Roman Catholic Our Lady of Malibu ; Steven Spielberg was seen at Temple Emanuel in Beverly Hills, hugging Gwyneth Paltrow following his daughter 's bat mitzvah.( His mom 's kosher restaurant, the Milky Way, is located in the heavily Jewish Pico-Robertson neighborhood.) There are also many more who do n't go to church, but that is true elsewhere. More than 80 percent of Americans might call themselves Christian but, according to a recent survey, only 43 percent regularly attend church. MTV star Jessica Simpson can relate. " I travel 300 days of the year, " she says, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is my church. " The entertainment industry-like most other workplaces-also believes in the separation of church and office. Hollywood has an unwritten rule, says Kirk Cameron : " It 's " We do n't care what you believe, just keep it to yourself. ' ' " Cameron, 33, once an atheist who played mischievous son Mike on Growing Pains, is now born again and starring in the Left Behind movies( which have earned an estimated $100 million), based on the megaselling Book of Revelation thrillers. Paula Cale, who costarred on Providence, says that although she is politically and socially liberal, her Mormonism makes her a black sheep in Hollywood. " People read that I am Mormon and think that I hate gay people. I am terrified to be judged in this city because of it. " Balancing faith and fame can also mean some tough choices. Cameron claims he has had to turn down no fewer than 100 jobs due to conflicts with his religious beliefs. Nonetheless, he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person is true to themselves and not change beliefs like a chameleon depending on who they are talking to. " When the Jewish New Year fell on what was to be his first day on The West Wing, actor Joshua Malina says, " I was terrified to ask for the day off, but I could n't possibly work on Rosh Hashanah. " Malina, a conservative Jew, put the question to his new bosses and, he reports, " they were very nice about it. " According to her father, Robert Thurman, a Buddhist scholar, Uma Thurman has said no to several films that, he says, " condone horror. "( She gives a pass to pal Quentin Tarantino, whose use of screen violence, says her dad, is " like a dance. ") The Passion 's staunch Catholic star Jim Caviezel has twice asked that his onscreen love scenes( in Angel Eyes and High Crimes) be made more modest. Born-again Stephen Baldwin says he will do bedroom scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a redemptive story line and adds, " You will not see me in a sequel to The Usual Suspects anytime soon. " Before Everybody Loves Raymond made her a star, Patricia Heaton( raised Catholic, now a practicing Presbyterian) was sent a film script that she felt was exploitative. Though broke, she never auditioned. Fortunately, Heaton, who says grace before meals and takes her four sons to church weekly, found a home on Raymond-one of the few shows to depict church-going as a matter of course. " Most people have some kind of faith, " she says. " It makes the show more real. " Keeping the faith in Hollywood, though, poses special challenges. " This business tests you constantly : the materialism, the pride, the ambition, " says Heaton. " The apostle Paul says, " I have died to myself and it 's no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. ' We 're supposed to " die to ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month to make sure everybody knows who I am? " Madonna has always publicized her spiritual growth-from Catholicism to embracing Hinduism through yoga, and now the Jewish mysticism of Kabbalah. Demi Moore and Britney Spears are also sporting the red-string Kabbalah bracelet, meant to ward off evil( see box, page 96). And Tom Cruise praises the virtues of Scientology in an attempt to demystify the controversial religion-which he shares with John Travolta, Kirstie Alley and other stars-to his fans. " I 've always found it ironic that Hollywood is seen as the godless place full of debauchery, " says Barbara Hall, a Methodist and the creator of the God-is-one-of-us hit Joan of Arcadia. " Everyone I know has four children and is in bed by 9 o'clock. " Still, the type of conservative Christians so thirsty for a film like The Passion are underrepresented among the Hollywood elite ; it may surprise evangelicals who decried director Kevin Smith 's 1999 comedy Dogma as blasphemous( it featured an abortionist who was a direct descendant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Catholic director 's films, God gets the top spot. " It ps the wife off a bit, " says Smith. " But God always gets thanked first. " Heaton says she understands the disconnect many feel when they go to the movies. " People look at the stuff that comes out of Hollywood and think, " Who are the people making this garbage? They could n't possibly have any connection to God. ' ' " Yet even her show does n't meet the demands of some frustrated viewers. Darrell Bock, a Dallas Theological Seminary professor, likes Everybody Loves Raymond but calls the show 's depiction of the absurdly narrow-minded Protestant in-laws " typical of the stereotyping that goes on. " Says Mac Brunson, the senior pastor at the First Baptist Church of Dallas : " It 's okay to be tolerant of everything but an evangelical Christian. In Hollywood, when it comes to the church, they go for the bizarre and psychotic. In Runaway Jury, there was a Baptist preacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abortion. I do n't know anyone that 's happened to. " He has hope that in the post-Passion era, Hollywood will respect the audience that has blessed Gibson with epic riches. Brunson says he does n't need more biblical sagas, just something he can watch with the family. In fact, he 's looking forward to the May romantic comedy Raising Helen, in which Kate Hudson plays a woman dating a pastor. " I 'm curious to see that, " he says. " Preachers can fall in love and act human. One time, I 'd love to see them capture that and get it right. " Memo to Dr. Brunson-the day to collectively pray for Kate Hudson is May 30. Sidebar All About Kabbalah A once-obscure form of Jewish mysticism gets a trendy-and controversial-makeover It 's Friday night at LA. ' s Kabbalah Centre, a former church on the fringes of Beverly Hills. On one side of the aisle Demi Moore, Torque starlet Monet Mazur, disco divaTaylor Dayne and dozens of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side Ashton Kutcher blends into a throng of men dressed in pristine white, clapping and stomping along. As Rabbi Philip Berg, the Centre 's founder, chants blessings, the crowd responds with deafening " Amens. " Lately, Hollywood 's sceniest spot may be here, the international headquarters of a spiritual empire based on medieval Jewish mysticism. Madonna drops by when she 's not in London, where she reportedly endowed a $6 million complex for the local branch. Britney Spears, Courtney Love and even Paris Hilton have turned up, sporting red string bracelets( consecrated at the tomb of biblical matriarch Rachel) said to ward off envious glances that can cause misfortune. Why are stars flocking to esoteric studies once reserved for Jewish males over 40? A major factor is the Centre 's nondenominational emphasis on personal growth, which provokes ire from religious purists but inspires awe among devotees. " It 's helped me get out of " it 's all about me, ' ' " says Mazur. " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With his new spin on Kabbalah, Berg, 74, has built a nonprofit giant that boasts more than 200,000 followers, 50 facilities worldwide and annual revenues of at least $5.5 million.( While services are free, 10-week classes cost up to $270 ; Centres also sell private-label jewelry, water, books and videos.) Kabbalah dates back to the 13th century, when Spanish mystic Moses de Leon published the Zohar( " Book of Splendor "). His revelation : The Torah-the first five books of the Bible-is written in code ; its deepest meanings can be decrypted through numerology, wordplay and meditation. After a few centuries of popularity, Kabbalah was relegated to the margins of Judaism. Fast-forward to the early ' ' 60s, when Feivel Gruberger, an Orthodox rabbi turned insurance salesman from Brooklyn, N.Y., met master Kabbalist Rav Yehuda Brandwein on a business trip to Israel and became Brandwein 's disciple. After Brandwein died in 1969, Gruberger-who changed his name to Philip Berg-set out to realize Brandwein 's vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karen, 61, he opened the first Kabbalah Centre in Tel Aviv in the 1970s. Interest exploded in the late ' ' 90s thanks to the Internet and Berg 's move to LA., which brought the Centre into Hollywood 's orbit. Touting its version of Kabbalah as a " spiritual technology, " the Centre welcomes worshippers of all faiths. Says Berg 's son and designated successorYehuda, 31 : " You try to package the thing to fit the generation. " Many scholars call the Centre 's tenets-that the key to happiness is sharing with others and controlling negative emotions ; that good and bad luck result largely from our own behavior, in this or a past life-oversimplifications of traditional teachings. The Centre offers " an amalgam of Kabbalah, New Age and self-help, " says former Berkeley religion professor Daniel Matt, author of a newly published translation of the Zohar 's first two volumes. Other criticisms are more disturbing. Groups ranging from Jews for Judaism to the anticult Freedom of Mind Center report cases in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their unbelieving spouses or make donations beyond their means. One ex-follower, Juliana, 25( who asked that her last name not be used), says she quit college to become a chevra, or volunteer staffer, at the L.A. Centre. For food, a shared room and a stipend of $35 a month, she says, she often worked from 9 a.m. to 1 a.m. When her father fell ill with heart disease, Juliana says her teachers told her to work harder and pray instead of visiting him. She was ostracized, she maintains, when she insisted on going anyway. Yehuda Berg denies that the Centre controls its followers or demands contributions, noting that every house of worship has its own way of raising funds : " Is there one synagogue that does n't have a gift shop? " His high-profile acolytes agree. " If it does n't work for you, that does n't mean it does n't work for others, " says Roseanne Barr. " What I like about Kabbalah is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ego inflates. I think it 's really good that people are talking about this subject in this particular town. " -Kenneth Miller in Los Angeles Here comes Brother Washington, " security guards murmur when longtime congregant Denzel Washington arrives for services at West Angeles Church of God in Christ, a Pentecostal church that is a hub for African-American A-listers. Along with wife Pauletta, Washington-whose dad was a Pentecostal minister-will either sit in the front row or blend in on the balcony. " It 's not a big deal, because the parishioners all know him " says his publicist Alan Nierob, who adds that the actor donates " in a quiet way " to the church, headed by much loved Bishop Charles E.

When she and her three brothers were young, " our way of practicing was to try to be kind to each other. " These days, he says, his kids " are not card-carrying " Buddhists. His pal Richard Gere is. And, Thurman says jokingly, " me and Goldie Hawn want to make a Buddha movie. " PATRICIA HEATON Raised Catholic, the Everybody Loves Raymond actress became a Presbyterian as an adult.

But confronted with Jesus you have to say, " I believe that or I do n't. " It 's very powerful. " KIRK SPEAKS OUT When asked to do an interview about Hollywood and religion, actor Kirk Douglas, who is Jewish, wrote a heartfelt letter recalling the anti-Semitism he endured as a child and his response to Mel Gibson 's The Passion of the Christ Despite charges of anti-Semitism against the film, some religious leaders say it has generated a renewed dialogue between Christians and Jews. But Douglas, 87, was disturbed by the seemingly benign portrayal of Roman governor Pontius Pilate, while the Jewish crowd calls for Jesus ' crucifixion. Excerpts from his letter : When I was about 7 years old, I came crying home to my mother with a bloody nose. My mother was appalled. " What happened? " " Yanak hit me! He said I killed Jesus! " " You killed what? " " I did n't kill him. I do n't even know who he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew bigger. They used women 's stockings filled with pebbles to hit me, yelling, " You killed Jesus Christ! "... I sat intently watching The Passion, and I was suddenly shocked to see Pontius Pilate play a scene as if he were Hamlet. He was very troubled and concerned about accusations against this man called Jesus Christ. He declared him innocent. The crowd outside roared with disapproval of his decision. Pontius reconsidered. Pontius reacted. He let the crowd make the decision. He asked them to choose between a thief, Barabbas, and Jesus. The crowd roars, " Crucify Jesus! " Then the violence begins. Unbearable, distasteful, sadomasochistic ; it was almost like a porno film with a naked man whipped until the blood flowed. It was shot from every conceivable angle. The audience reacted in many different ways. Some were appalled. Some cried. Mel, I am a Jew. You are a Catholic. I think you did a disservice to both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jews and Christians have comfortable dialogue. At the present time, the Catholic Church has many problems to deal with. They do n't want another. Now, was it worth the money? MARTIN SHEEN Once a lapsed Catholic, Sheen( who worships near his Malibu home) rediscovered the faith in ' ' 81 after the success of Apocalypse Now. " I came back to the church of Mother Teresa, " the frequent activist told Reader 's Digest, " and began to get involved in socialJustice issues.

Ben Affleck( who is a nonpracticing Episcopalian) has said she insisted that her children be raised in the church. When the couple split up, Lopez turned to Merle Gonzales, a Cuban-born Santeria priestess in East L.A. Common among Caribbean immigrants, Santeria combines Catholic iconography with West African traditions. Sidebar WHAT IS SCIENTOLOGY? Lisa Marie Presley has called it " the most incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cruise credits it with helping " me to be able to live the kind of life that I 'm living. " The U.S. government grants it the tax-exempt status of a religion. So just what is the Church of Scientology? Founded in the 1950s by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard, Scientology holds that " man is a spiritual being... able to accomplish his goals and gain lasting happiness. " Scientologists begin their journey during an " auditing " session. They are wired to an " e-meter, " similar to a lie detector, which monitors reaction to pahiful memories. And by discussing those experiences, the member aims to erase the damage of the past. Advocates of the church praise its literacy and drug recovery programs, though its reputation suffers because former members have called it a mind-controlling cult. " Give us a break, " said John Travolta. " Being the bold personalities we are, do you honestly think we 'd let ourselves be controlled?
