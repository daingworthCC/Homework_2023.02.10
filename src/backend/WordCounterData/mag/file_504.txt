4105841 The designer of the fabled Pucci label makes a cool home for himself in historic Florence <p> WHEN PETER DUNDAS swaggers into a room, his hunky six-foot-two-inch frame poured into low-slung, hip-hugging white jeans and his blond tresses burnt to an ocean crisp, you could be forgiven for miscalculating his vocation. The heeled Yves Saint Laurent boots, giant silver belt buckle, and sharp-shouldered jacket summon Jim Morrison ambling freely along Venice Beach, but Dundas, 41, is no spoiled, tortured rocker. And he 's no beach bum either, though his never-fade golden tan, hard body, and super-chill attitude seem to be the spoils of a life spent hunting for the perfect wave. <p> The last thing you expect him to be is the fashion guy. Especially not the creative director for Emilio Pucci, the glittery Italian luxury label co-owned by LVMH. Founder Emilio Pucci was a dashing Florentine nobleman who could trace his family 's lineage back six centuries. Dundas was born in Norway and then raised in the pedestrian confines of Indiana. <p> But both men share an intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marchese first courted his ladies on the island of Capri, Dundas, the former designer at Emanuel Ungaro and right hand to Roberto Cavalli and Jean Paul Gaultier, has been remarkably effective in lassoing fashion 's It girls, like devoted fan and friend Eugnie Niarchos, into his irresistibly sexy designs. " Men appreciate what he does too ; that 's the good part, " says Niarchos. <p> " It 's really the lifestyle element of Pucci that I like most, " demurs Dundas coyly. Emilio may have been the prince of prints back in the ' 60s, but he was also a legendary king of leisure. And who would n't want to revive that? <p> " I believe in living the dream in the real sense, " says Dundas, who just went to Phuket, where he stayed in a billion-star hotel to see if its black swimming pool would suit the home he 's building on the Greek island of Naxos.( It would.) <p> When he moved to Florence from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dundas scooped up a dazzling apartment atop a 15th-century Renaissance palace. " The whole palazzo vibe that you get in Florence is so unique, " he says of his sweeping, sunlight-filled living quarters. " And aspirational. It 's like you have to be part of the club. " <p> The home 's antique flourishes, like its ancient elevator, 550-year-old frescoes, and canopied bed, play off the sultry ' 70s bachelor-lair-by-the-sea feel of the multitiered main salon with a checkered ceiling, hammock- and barbecue-outfitted roof deck, and palm-fronded terrace. Dundas moves briskly from this abode in Florence during the week for work and then weekends in Paris with his chocolate Labrador, Hannibal, to quick breaks wherever the wind is strongest for his kite-surfing expeditions. <p> Dundas 's party-throwing days have been sidelined, as of late, by his new job responsibilities. " These last two years have gone at warp speed, " he says. " I love having parties, but even a phone call with my best friend is difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newest crop of hot designers -- Riccardo Tisci at Givenchy, Peter Copping at Nina Ricci, and Christophe Decarnin, recently of Balmain -- who can relate to the job pressure. " It 's a funny club, " he says. " You know exactly what they 're going through. " <p> There 's a reason that Dundas has had a 10-year run on the party circuit in Ibiza and that he can be found huddled in a booth with Niarchos, Julia Restoin Roitfeld, or Blake Lively at Paris 's chicest late-night soirees. <p> " It 's a way of understanding my client, " Dundas explains. " Go to the places where you want to dress the girl. See what she likes. Participate. Learn from it. " The late-night market research, says Dundas, " can be a lot of work because I am quite shy, but it works for my craft. " Luckily, recuperating also has its professional benefits : " I do my best work in bed, " Dundas says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take off. So, you know...
