4142541 Darius and Girenas # Hal Wert tells the story of the two Lithuanian-American aviators, Steponas Darius and Stanley Girenas, whose attempt to bring honour to the land of their birth ended tragically in July 1933 # All of America, in fact most of the world, was in love with flying in the late 1920s and 1930s. Adventurous aviators bent on setting new records captured the public 's imagination. Aviation represented an escape from the mundane aspects of everyday life and an affirmation of a brighter future based on technology. Americans simply could not get enough of flying. Barnstormers and flying circuses were a part of every county fair and long-distance races and airshows were front page news. Hollywood heralded the hero aviator, the handsome, devil-may-care First World War fighter pilot, in a number of box office successes, such as William Wellman 's Wings( 1928) and Howard Hughes ' Hell 's Angels( 1930). As the country sunk into the Great Depression, 85 million Americans still found the money each week to go to the movies. # In 1919 a New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $25,000 for the first transatlantic flight made in either direction by a fixed-wing aircraft. No one attempted the challenge as existing aircraft were simply incapable of the crossing. In 1924 Orteig offered the prize again but with a five year expiry date. The aircraft industry had made giant strides since his first offer and dozens of competitors now entered the fray, though it was still a dangerous prospect due to volatile weather, unreliable aircraft and primitive navigational equipment. # By 1926 a small number of serious competitors remained in the running. That autumn, Ren Fonck, the renowned French Ace of Aces, and his co-pilot Lawrence Curtin of the US Navy, attempted to fly the Atlantic west to east. Racing down the runway in their specially designed $100,000 tri-motor Sikorsky S-35, the landing gear collapsed just before take-off. Plummeting down an embankment the overweight, uninsured plane burst into flames killing the radio operator and mechanic. Soon after, the famous Arctic explorer, Admiral Richard E. Byrd, declared that he and his tri-motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test flight on April 16th, 1927 in front of a huge crowd resulted in a crash in which both Byrd and his co-pilot were injured. # Not long after, at Roosevelt Field in New York City, Byrd, Clarence Chamberlain, Bert Acosta and the lesser known mail pilot Charles Lindbergh were busy testing their planes. All waited for a break in the weather in order to better their chances of completing the transatlantic flight but were nearly eclipsed by Charles Nungesser and Francis Coli who took off from Paris in a PL-8 biplane, the L'Oiseau Blanc, on May 8th. This plane either dropped into the sea off Newfoundland or crashed along the Maine coast. What exactly happened remains a mystery. With the disappearance of Nungesser and Coli the eager aircrews at Roosevelt Field had their eyes on the prize. # Weather conditions remained poor but Lindbergh reasoned that his competitors would play it safe and that his only chance of winning was to get into the air immediately. He told the press : ' What kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't believe in taking foolish chances. But nothing can be accomplished by not taking a chance at all. ' In his single engine, Ryan monoplane, Spirit of St Louis, Lindbergh completed this first transatlantic crossing in 33 hours, 30 minutes, 30 seconds. When he landed at Le Bourget pavilion, outside Paris, the crowds broke through the barricades and rushed the plane. Lindburgh 's achievement firmly established the cult of the solo pilot braving the elements in a precarious machine, a mystique that would dominate aviation in the 1930s. # Lindbergh 's record inspired many followers : people like Wiley Post, first to circumnavigate the globe solo in July 1933 ; and Amelia Earhart, the first woman to fly the Atlantic alone in 1932. But between 1926 and 1933 more pilots and crews were killed attempting the passage than succeeded. Often flying solo, they simply disappeared over the vast oceans of the world, condemned to watery graves, never to be found. # Amid this aviation hoop-la, two Lithuanian-American pilots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) Girenas, decided to chance their luck. In 1932 they announced their intention to fly nonstop from New York City to Kaunas, Lithuania in an effort to break Lindbergh 's non-stop distance record. The two hoped to place themselves centre stage and to honour their long suffering mother country, a newly independent nation created by the Versailles Treaty in the aftermath of the First World War. # Steponas Jucevicius-Daracius was born on January 8th, 1896 in rural Rubiske, north-western Lithuania. His father, a farmer, died when he was nine and his mother remarried. Soon after, the family emigrated to the US. In 1909 they moved from Newark, New Jersey to Bridgeport, a Lithuanian community on Chicago 's South Side. Enthralled with the latest developments in aviation Steponas found a part-time job as an errand-boy for the aviation store owned by Orville and Wilbur Wright. Nearby was Ashburn Field, one of Chicago 's first airfields, which opened in 1916. The airport quickly became a place where enthusiasts could learn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans the First World War raging in Europe was largely focused on the trenches in France and Belgium. For the Lithuanian community, the concern was the German occupation of their native country ; a sprawling conflict between Germany and Russia that held the possibility of Lithuanian independence. In 1917, after the US declared war on Germany, Steponas dropped out of his engineering course, changed his names to a more American sounding Stephen Darius and enlisted in the Illinois National Guard. As a telephone repairman at the front Darius participated in numerous battles and at the Second Battle of the Marne he suffered a chest wound from shrapnel and was gassed. Discharged after 18 months, the decorated veteran returned to the US and enrolled in engineering at the University of Chicago. # By 1919 Lithuania was at war with the Bolshevik Red Army and in 1920 conflict broke out with Poland over the Vilnius region. Lithuania, committed to establishing borders that included all Lithuanians, lobbied the Allies for the transfer of Klaipeda( Memel) and surrounding territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lithuanian-American Soldiers, became heavily involved in politicking for his newly independent country, helping to recruit volunteers for the Lithuanian army. In autumn 1920 he returned to Kaunas himself and joined the military academy for officer training. Fourteen months later, commissioned with the rank of lieutenant, he applied to the select air corps training squadron and was accepted into its elite programme. On October 12th, 1922 he made his first solo flight in a German First World War surplus reconnaissance biplane, an Albatros B-11. # The League of Nations and the French occupiers dallied on the status of Klaipeda on the Baltic coast, trying to decide whether it would become a part of Lithuania or a free city like Danzig. The Lithuanian government decided to take matters into its own hands and instigated a rebellion that took over the city, a fait accompli for the hamstrung League. Darius, on official leave from his air unit, joined several hundred filibusters, members of the Lithuanian Riflemen 's Union, who entered Klaipeda as ' civilians ', @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on January 15th. Four days later Lithuania annexed the disputed territory. For his role Darius received the Liberation of Klaipeda Silver Medal awarded by the Salvation Committee of Lithuania Minor. # By 1927 Darius had been promoted to captain and had racked up nearly 400 flying hours. After seven years in the air corps he decided to return to the US to visit relatives and explore opportunities. Even though his wife of three years refused to accompany him with their baby daughter, he took a year 's leave from the air corps telling friends that he was toying with the idea of flying back to Lithuania. On his way back to America Darius happened to be in Paris the night Lindbergh completed his transatlantic flight. Swept up in the excitement at Le Bourget, he told himself that one day he would attempt to break Lindbergh 's record. In Chicago Darius bought a WACO-3511 aircraft and began hauling cargo. A business failure in an airfield venture in Indiana forced him to sell his plane and in 1929 he went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago. # Stanislovas Tomas Girskis-Girenas was born on October 15th, 1894 in Vytogala, then a part of tsarist Russia and close to Darius ' birthplace in north-western Lithuania. Stanislovas was the youngest of 16 children of whom 12 died in childhood. His father died in 1904, followed by his mother two years later. At the age of 16 he decided to follow his eldest brother to America. In Chicago, Stasys( as he was now known) lived with relatives and attended grammar school for three years. He got work as a printing press operator for the Lithuanian News. Always thinking of ways to increase his income he saved enough money to buy a motorboat and started a business offering pleasure rides on Lake Michigan. # A love of machines naturally attracted Stasys to flying. He volunteered for service as soon as the US declared war in 1917, only to be rejected on the basis of poor health. Refusing to accept the judgement, he travelled to St Louis, Missouri re-enrolled under the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11th, 1917 he was sent to the 136th Army Aero Squadron, where he was trained as a mechanic. Neither Girch nor his unit was sent overseas and he spent his time at two Texas airfields, Love Field, Dallas and Kelly Field, San Antonio. Discharged in April 1919 he returned to his job as a printing press operator. In 1921 he and some friends pooled their savings and started a cab company, which lasted until the Great Depression in the early 1930s. # In 1924 Girch began to take flying lessons at H.C. Keller 's famous Flying School at Chicago 's Cicero Field. By the end of the year Girch and his new Swedish friend E. Larson were novice pilots and bought their first plane. Girch now supplemented his income by flying out of Ashburn Field carrying cargo, passengers and pleasure seekers. On one of the first flights, on September 20th, 1925, with Larson at the controls, the plane stalled and crashed. Larson was uninjured but Girch broke a leg and three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year recuperating. Finally healed, he and Larson bought a used First World War Jenny JN-4. Girch made his first solo flight on March 8th, 1927 in a more up to date WACO-9. # During his time at the Keller Flying School, Girch became an excellent pilot who learned to stunt fly and to perform aerobatics. Like Darius, he flew in numerous competitions and races. In 1931 he won an American Legion Aviation Post trophy for landing his aircraft in a small designated area from 1,000 feet with a shut-off engine. He now possessed a mechanic 's licence, a pilot 's licence and a transport pilot 's licence. Together with another well-known Lithuanian pilot, Tony Mackowitz, he founded the G and M Flying Service, purchased a new Parks P-1 aircraft and started to give flying lessons at Ashburn Field. # In 1932, at his sister 's restaurant on South Halsted Street in Bridgeport, Darius finally met Stanley Girch. The two swiftly became friends, sharing their dream of flying the Atlantic. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Lithuanian communities, both craved recognition in the wider world. What better way to achieve this than a successful record breaking international flight, at the same time honouring the homeland? Though the difficulties seemed insurmountable, they decided to pursue their ambition. The Lithuanian writer, Peter Jurgela, promised to help them with publicity and advice. His first suggestion was that Stanley use a part of his family 's last name, Girenas, as it sounded more Lithuanian. # In June of 1932 Darius proposed that they each put up $1,600 dollars and buy a 1929 Bellanca Pacemaker CH-300, just traded in by the Chicago Daily News. As he had frequently flown the aircraft, Darius knew the plane 's condition and trusted it. Both pilots knew that the Bellanca would need significant and expensive refitting in order to make the long ocean flight. Attempts to find sponsors failed and they decided to follow Jurgela 's advice and appeal directly to Chicago 's Lithuanian community. On July 11th, 1932 the Chicago Lithuanian newspapers Friend and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York to Kaunas '. Two days later, at the Lithuanian Consulate, a group of community leaders and businessmen formed the Transatlantic Flight Organizing Committee, which agreed to sponsor ' aviation days ' in Lithuanian communities across the country. Ten thousand spectators flooded Harlem Airfield for the first event. Building on this success, Darius and Girenas put on airshows in most major cities in the eastern US. Assorted fundraising activities brought in $4,200, mostly in contributions of $1 to $3 dollars. For a $25 donation, a hefty contribution in one of the worst years of the Depression, the donor 's name would be inscribed upon a scroll painted on the side of the plane. Meanwhile, for Lithuanians, the proposed flight was becoming a kind of nationalist cause clbre on both sides of the Atlantic. # With the money in hand, in January 1933, the Bellanca was sent for refitting to the workshops of E.M. Laird, a well-known airplane designer and manufacturer, at Chicago 's Municipal Airport. Laird had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girenas, charged with supervising the overhaul, installed a new engine, lengthened and widened the wings, reinforced the landing gear, and had specially-built fuel tanks added as well as updated navigational instruments. The cost of the refitting exceeded by several thousand dollars the amount raised. # Darius, suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, spent winters in milder climes. While Girenas refitted the Bellanca, Darius wintered in Florida where he put in many hours flying over the ocean at night, perfecting celestial navigation and plotting possible courses for the upcoming gruelling flight. The pair would find their way by the stars, if any were visible but, if not, by ' dead reckoning ', that is by logging the estimated speed and direction flown. By spring 1933, his tuberculosis in remission, Darius appeared healthy and fit. # February brought good news as both the US and Lithuanian post offices had officially approved the pilots to carry mail. Each letter would cost $2 and bear a special commemorative cancellation mark. One big problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girenas originally proposed Lithvega( Lithuanian Star). But Anthony Vaivada, a journalist with the Lithuanian News, suggested the plane be given the Latin name Lituanica. His suggestion was immediately endorsed by all concerned and on May 6th, on the runway at Municipal Airport, the plane was so christened by Darius ' mother. A farewell banquet was held the night before in Bridgeport, where the necessary cash shortfall was made good by generous donors. On May 7th the Lituanica flew on to Newark, New Jersey for another banquet and fundraising event. The following morning the plane made the short hop to Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn. # As guests of the City of New York the pilots were quartered at the Half Moon Hotel on Coney Island. Now Darius and Girenas began the long wait for a break in the weather and for an assortment of paperwork authorising their flight. The plan to take off on May 20th, the anniversary of Lindberghs flight, vanished. They consulted daily with Dr James H. Kimball, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Manhattan at Battery Park. Days turned into weeks and weeks into months, but still the North Atlantic refused to give up its stormy winter ways. In mid-June Wiley Post joined them, set on completing a solo flight round the world in six days in his plane the Winnie Mae. The three got along famously, as they commis-serated over the unyielding weather. The Lituanica, fine-tuned and tested daily, was nightly guarded in Hangar No 7. Post spent his days in a similar routine tuning and testing his plane. But the Vega Minnie Mae was a decidedly superior aircraft to the Lituanica. Meanwhile the permits required to fly over each country on Darius ' flight plan had still not arrived. Neither of the two flyers, however, took this very seriously as they had US passports and Lithuanian and German visas. More critically, their money was running out. Some in the Lithuanian press now suggested that the transatlantic flight scheme was merely a scam. Pressure was building. # On July 14th, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Dr Kimball finally reported that on the following day ' weather conditions along the American coast were favourable ; that there were some rain showers over the Atlantic, but the winds were favourable ; and more ominously that the weather in Europe was unstable. ' At 11pm, as Darius and Girenas were discussing with ground crew whether or not to fly the next day, the phone rang. It was a call from the Lituanica 's mechanic who had just learned that Wiley Post planned to take off early next morning for Berlin. The news galvanised the two flyers. If Post would fly in the morning they would, too. # When Darius and Girenas arrived at the airfield around 4.30 am their mechanics were already servicing the plane for the projected 40.5 hours in the air -32 gallons of oil and 779 gallons of fuel of which 135 gallons were in five gallon cans to the rear of the pilot 's seats. Sandwiches, water, coffee, fruit, a quart of scotch, cigarettes, chewing gum, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A small crowd of bystanders had gathered to witness Post 's take-off. None of these knew that Darius and Girenas were also planning to depart shortly, but their preparations aroused suspicion. When quizzed by airport officials, they mumbled that they were simply conducting a fully loaded test. # About an hour before Post taxied onto the field a cable came from Paris warning that there was a serious storm brewing out of the Mediterranean and moving north. Post calculated mat since his Vega averaged 180 miles per hour he needed roughly 24 hours flying time and could therefore slip into Berlin just ahead of the storm. John Heinmuller of the National Aeronautical Association, suspecting the two Lithuanian pilots planned to follow in Post 's wake, confronted them, explaining that their slower Bellanca would almost certainly fly into extremely dangerous weather when it reached the coast of Europe. Why Darius and Girenas failed to heed this warning is unknowable. Perhaps Darius recalled Lindbergh 's remark : ' What kind of man would live where there is no danger? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A little over an hour later Darius and Girenas climbed aboard their heavily laden aircraft. G.D. McLean, a journalist with the Brooklyn Times, wrote that Darius ' nodded to the mechanics to drag away the wheel chocks of the Bellanca, and gave the huge orange ship a full throttle '. Halfway down the runway the plane lifted off momentarily and then touched down. With just ten feet of runway remaining, the plane, slowly rose into the air, clearing the waves of the bay by some three feet. The Lituanica gained altitude and disappeared over the eastern horizon. So began a journey that lasted 37 hours and 11 minutes and covered 6,411 miles( the second longest non-stop flight recorded to that date). Over Newfoundland the pilots dropped a message that all was well. After that they were not heard from again. However, both pilots knew that when they reached the coast of Europe, even if they were off course, they had enough fuel to reach Kaunas. Late on the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darius wrote in his log that the Lituanica had run into the projected bad weather. This was his last entry. The pilots apparently attempted to fly around the storm. About 11pm that evening the plane was spotted over Stargard near Danzig, but flying north-east. It was subsequently spotted 120 miles north of Berlin. In low cloud, heavy rain and pitch darkness, the bright orange aircraft circled low and tossed out a flare. Darius and Girenas were in search of a spot to land. Half an hour later they attempted to land in what they thought was an open field near the village of Kuhdamm. The Bellanca clipped the top of the trees for over 200 feet and crashed to the forest floor. # Meanwhile, a crowd of 25,000 had gathered at the airfield in Kaunas to welcome the aviators, but as the storm rolled in, lightning filled the sky and the plane failed to arrive. The crowd sensed that something was badly wrong. In an effort to ease the tension the crowd began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falcons. Early next morning word arrived that a woman from a nearby village had discovered the wreckage of the Lituanica while searching for mushrooms. Darius had been thrown some ten feet from the plane. Girenas ' body remained in the cabin. Both had apparently been killed on impact. # When local officials arrived, a small group of souvenir hunters was carrying away parts of the plane. Order was soon restored as Nazi storm troopers sealed off the crash site. Hitler, diplomatically courting Lithuania, ordered the bodies to be removed to a chapel in Soldin, in coffins draped with a large Nazi flag and mounds of fresh flowers. On July 19th a guard of honour of storm troopers accompanied the bodies to Stettin where, with great pomp, they were transferred to a Junker tri-motor operated by Deruluft airlines. At the Lithuanian border formations of military aircraft escorted Darius and Girenas home, where 50,000 mourners greeted them. The state funeral the following day was the largest in Lithuanian history. An estimated 60,000 people made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceivable location. After the funeral the bodies awaited the completion of a granite mausoleum in Kaunas ' Catholic cemetery. On November 1st, 1937 the pilots ' bodies were laid to rest in glass-topped bronze coffins, so that they could be viewed by the public. In the United States money was raised to construct an Art Deco monument in the corner of Marquette Park in the heart of Chicago 's Lithuanian community, completed in July 1935. In 1939 the Lithuanian pavilion in the New York World 's Fair was dedicated to Darius and Girenas. Over the years additional monuments have been built and honours bestowed. # Had Darius and Girenas succeeded they would have achieved instant, though perhaps not lasting, fame, but their deaths guaranteed them permanent celebrity. There was much speculation about the reasons for the crash : mechanical failure, lightning, poor visibility, fatigue or the widely held belief among Lithuanians that the Nazis shot down the plane, even though inspection of the wreckage showed no bullet holes. Another rumour gained currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had risen up and grabbed the plane. # Since the failed flight the two pilots have become a patriotic symbol of the need for struggle and sacrifice in a small nation whose modern history has been characterised by extreme suffering at the hands of larger aggressive neighbours bent on domination, exploitation or annexation. Darius and Girenas have become an integral part of Lithuanian history, folk heroes in song and deed, much like the ancient tales of the northern forest, immortalised on stamps, coins, banknotes and celebrated in word and song. The flight of the Lituanica has become the symbol of a nation. # Further Reading # Scott Berg, Lindbergh( G.P. Putnam, 1998). # Bryan B. Sterling and Frances N.
