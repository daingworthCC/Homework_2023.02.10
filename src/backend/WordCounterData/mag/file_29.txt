2003941 Stuff a time capsule with your things, and you 'll forever save today for tomorrow. Here 's how to build your own homemade time capsule! TEXT AND PHOTOGRAPHS BY DIANA LYNN // The Scouts of Sunnyvale, Calif., Troop 463 know where they 're going to be January 2018. They have promised to meet again to celebrate their troop 's 50th anniversary, swap stories and remember the good ol days-way back in 1999. People tend to forget a lot of things about the past. But these Scouts wo n't. They 've built a time capsule to open at their 2018 reunion. You can build one too. It 's a great way to capture the past.( Only one more month until 2000!) Rember When... " We 'll get a laugh out of this thing in 20 years! " Tenderfoot Scout David Yurash said, holding up a Sega Game Gear. Then he stuck the electronic game into the time capsule. Other Scouts added more items until the olng plastic cylinder was stuffed with everything from a wood marshmallow stick to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, carried the heavy capsule to the underground " vault " they had prepared, sealed the capsule, buried it and built a concrete marker over the top. May it rest in peace until they dig it up in 19 years. " I 'll be back here for the capsule opening even if I live across the country. " Life Scout Anthony Comfort said. " I would n't miss our reunion for the world. " Doing It Right Troop 463 used a heavy-duty capsule, a 44-inch-long polyethylene container like those the U.S. Navy uses to store sonobuoys( which track enemy submarines).

Keep items dry by storing each item in a polyethylene bag. Avoid rubber bands, which break down over time, melting into goo. Use cotton and natural cloth, which tend to last longer than other fabrics. Copy newspaper and magazine articles and photographs onto long-lasting acid-free paper. Roll instead of folding items. Old, folded paper tends to tear instead of unfolding. Tag each item identifying the donor, the nature of the item and its name. Avoid repeating items. Buried Treasure Keeping water out of an underground capsule is no easy trick. That 's why some capsules are stored in closets, built into walls or even left out in full view. Buried capsules must be sealed with silicon and plastic tape before the entire outside is coated with pitch or asphalt. Then that 's wrapped in plastic. The capsule is then laid into a " vault, " a hole 3 feet deep, with 6 inches of gravel on the bottom and concrete walls. Finally it 's covered with sand or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't just remind us of the past. They also let us speak to the future. Troop 463 sent this message to 2018 : " The values of the Scout Oath and Law will be as important in the future as they are today. " Photograph // Then they put into the capsule their own predictions and hopes for the year 2018. Many wrote about how different the future will be. Some wrote about how they want to become computer experts. Others wrote about becoming FBI agents, aerospace engineers, kayaking instructors, jet pilots or racecar drivers. In 20 years, their hopes and predictions might or might not come true. Either way, they 'll never forget. Capsulized History Unlike Troop 463 's, some capsules are made by accident. Sunken ships, lost treasures and forgotten trunks in attics make us feel connected to bygone days. Ancient Egyptian tombs are like time capsules too.

Then, in 1939, a capsule was buried 50 feet below the grounds of the New York World 's Fair, and the name " Time Capsule " first appeared.( That capsule is n't scheduled to be opened until 6939!) ' Hellooo! Anybody Out There? ' If one of the time capsules shot into space ever drifts onto the area of another inhabited planet-stand back! Space alienen and rock music could be a dangerous combination. In 1997 NASA launched two time capsules aboard twoVoyager spacecfaft. Today, the capsules travel a milliom miles a day into deep space. Each capsule contains a gold-plated phnograph record telling about life on Earth. There 's not much chance anyone( anything?) will ever play one of these records. But if they do, they 'll hear " hello " in 55 Earth languages, the the calls of humpback whale, the cry of a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that aliens will discover in each capsule : 116 photographs of humans living their ordinary lives around our planet. That 'll scare'em! Sidebar Your Time Capsule Checklist Do n't forget to include these items in your time capsule. The might seem ordinary now, but who knows what future civilizations might think? Scouting items : knife, compass etc. a Scout uniform photographs of yourselves with names written on the back( Black and white last longer, color photos fade.) crafts made by the troop a set of coins and stamps copies of Scout songs written and recorded troop stories( funny, sad or scary things that have happened-include anything that Scouts would like to read about in the future) letters from each Scout telling about himself and what he plans to be doing in the future a letter from the troop telling what they hope for in the future a list of all members ' name and addresses copies of Boys ' Life and other current magazines and newspapers predictions letters from the parents to their sons popular electronis devices, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MISSING TIME CAPSULES The Scouts Troop 463 will have a lot of fun opening their time capsule in 2018. Others have n't been so lucky. The Bicentennial Wagon Train Capsule : This famous capsule held the signature of 22 million Americans. But on July 4, 1976, when President Gerald Ford arrived at the dedication ceremony in Valley Forge. Pa., the capsule could n't be found. Someone had stolen it. The Corona Time Capsules : The California city of Corona misplaced 17 time capsules dating to the 1930 's. People have torn up a lot of concrete around city hall but still have n't found them. The M*A*S*H Time Capsule : In 1983, the actors in this popular television show buried some of their props and costumes in a secret time capsule ceremony. Now the parking lot where they buried it may be under a giant new hotel. No one will say. The Capsule of Blackpool Tower : It was buried into the foundation of an English tower in the 1800 's but now it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and it remains an unsolved mystery. To avoid losing your time capsule, register its location and contents with the International Time Capsule Society.

The ITCS database will serve to remind future generations of existing capsules so they are not forgotten or lost. // <p>
