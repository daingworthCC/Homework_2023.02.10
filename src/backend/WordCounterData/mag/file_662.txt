4148641 Home Clinic # Q+A # We had several large family cookouts this summer, and our pressure-treated deck is, basically, trashed. It 's covered in grease stains, muddy footprints, and moldy leaves. Should I clean it up now, or can it wait until next spring? # Spruce up your deck now while the weather is still good. The change in seasons brings moderate weather that permits deck cleaner to work more effectively because it does n't dry too rapidly. Plus, once the job is done, it 's easier to apply a new finish--cooler temperatures reduce the chance of lap marks. # Before you clean, make repairs. Replace splintered and rotted parts, and sand down any rough spots. Be sure to use stainless-steel or weatherproof fasteners, not drywall screws or plain steel fasteners, which rust. If you have n't checked your deck for structural soundness, now is a good time. " It 's particularly important to inspect where the deck attaches to the house to ensure it is not at risk of collapse, " says Bill Jacques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " It 's not unusual to find that the deck is poorly attached with nails instead of through bolts or lag screws. " For detailed guidance, download the Deck Evaluation Checklist from the North American Deck and Railing Association( nadra.org). # Grab the family and get to work. Protect siding and adjacent surfaces with dropcloths or sheet plastic taped in place, and use a broom, leaf blower, and putty knife to remove debris from the deck 's surface and between individual deck boards. Wash the deck with a cleaner formulated for exterior wood. Rust stains and tannin stains from leaves, berries, and nuts are I among the toughest to remove from a deck, and cleaners that contain chlorine bleach can make them worse. Instead, use a cleaner containing oxalic acid( wood bleach), such as Flood Wood Cleaner or Behr Premium All-in-One Wood Cleaner. In most cases, apply it with a paint roller, paintbrush, or garden sprayer. Scrub heavily soiled areas with a deck brush ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and let it sit for a few hours first. # Rinse the deck thoroughly with a garden hose or a low-power pressure washer. The procedure is much the same if you 're removing a finish, but you apply a finish remover formulated for decks. Whether cleaning or stripping finishes, do n't overdo it. If the wood begins to look pulpy as you clean or pressure-wash, you 're going at it with too much force. # After the deck has dried thoroughly, apply a clear water-repellent finish that contains an antifungal agent. A well-sealed deck resists stains from fallen leaves and nuts, so your deck will look better next spring--just in time to start the fun all over again. # Control Freak-Out # I installed compact-fluorescent and LED bulbs throughout my house. They work well everywhere but not with dimmer switches. The bulbs either dim insufficiently, flicker, or they do n't light at all. It 's driving me crazy. How do I correct this? # The complex circuitry in these new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, a typical dimmer switch( now called a legacy dimmer in the electrical industry) wo n't work properly, if at all, with CFL or LED bulbs. # Legacy dimmers were designed to work with incandescents, and CFL and LED bulbs bear no electrical resemblance to these types of bulbs. Comparing them is like equating an electric heating element and a television set. Both use electricity and both give off light, but that 's where the similarity ends. # The solution is to buy a dimmer switch rated for both CFL and LED bulbs. Two reputable manufacturers of CFL/LED dimmers are Leviton and Lutron ; both provide lists of bulbs they 've verified will work with their dimmers. Next, buy dimmable CFL and LED bulbs that you know will function with your switch. Though these bulbs may also work with the older legacy dimmers, it 's likely you 'll experience some of the problems you mentioned. It 's worth noting that in 2011 the National Electrical Code was changed specifically to require a neutral wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ install most new switches in an older house so long as you carefully follow the manufacturer 's instructions. If you have any questions about whether a specific switch is compatible with your wiring or a specific bulb or light fixture, contact the manufacturer 's technical service department. # Not-So-Super Bowl # My toilet was leaking from underneath the bowl every time I flushed, so I replaced the wax ring. It 's still leaking. What did I do wrong? # Replacing the wax ring was a good start. We 've seen homeowners try to fix such leaks by caulking around the base of the toilet. All that does is trap wastewater beneath the bowl, which creates a foul, rotten mess. Yuck. # However, it sounds as though you either sized the wax ring incorrectly or damaged it during installation. These gaskets typically come in two sizes : standard and extra-thick. Sometimes the closet flange--that 's the part that sits over the drain and is bolted to the floor--is set too far below the toilet 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after laying a new floor that is thicker than the original surface. In this case, use an extra-thick wax ring to span the distance and provide a watertight seal. # When you reinstall your toilet, do n't slide it into position, as this can damage the fragile gasket. Instead, lower the bowl over the center of the drain. Be warned, though : Toilets can be quite heavy, so get help if needed. # Another option is to use a wax-free ring. These rubber gaskets typically accommodate floors raised up to % inch above the toilet flange. Some even help position the toilet correctly over the drain. # Lawn or Salad? # My lawn is infested with wild onions. I thought I had them beat after pulling them up wherever possible, but this winter they returned in force. Do you have any suggestions for getting rid of them without also wiping out my lawn? # Wild onions( Allium canadense) appear in late fall, continue to grow through the spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them is only a temporary fix because often the bulbs remain in the ground, only to reemerge later as stinky plants. # First, check with your local cooperative extension for advice about weed-control measures where you live. In many parts of the country where cool-climate grasses are the norm, you can try crowding out the onions with good lawn-cultivation practices. Reseed the lawn in late summer or early fall, and apply either a fertilizer without herbicide, or a seed-starter fertilizer. Keep the lawn moist to ensure that the grass seed germinates. Apply a second dose of fertilizer in the late fall just before the ground freezes. # Next spring, apply a preemergent fertilizer( a fertilizer with herbicide that knocks out weeds before they sprout) just when the soil is warming and the forsythia in your area start to bloom. If you miss that window, apply post-emergent fertilizer. It will cause your lawn to grow like crazy and will choke out the wild onions. # Here 's some expert advice for next time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too short, you are just asking for weed growth. Set the deck height of your mower to around 3% to 4 inches, which is the second-highest or highest setting. # TOOLS &amp; TECH # CHANNELLOCK E-SERIES TOOLS( $21-$33) # Channellock uses a laser to harden select surfaces of its new American-made E-Series tools, which are slightly sleeker versions of its famously robust pliers. Each tool begins as a round bar of 1080 tool steel that is forged, trimmed, machined, and ground before a high-energy laser is directed at its cutting edges and jaw surfaces. Because the heated area is relatively small, the metal cools so rapidly that quenching baths of oil or water are unnecessary, which saves energy and eliminates environmental concerns associated with the disposing of toxic liquids. # WHY WE LIKE THEM # We tried two new E-Series tools : the E338 diagonal cutting pliers and the E318 long-nose pliers. Both live up to Channellock 's 127-year reputation for toughness, a crisp cut, and a good grip. Their forward-positioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply. # Summer was a good time! To get your deck looking like it did before the party, invest in a few simple-but-essential tools and specialty deck-cleaning products. # E338 XLT Diagonal Cutting Pliers #
