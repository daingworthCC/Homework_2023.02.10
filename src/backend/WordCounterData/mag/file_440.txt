WE 'RE ONLY HAPPY WHEN YOU 'RE HAPPY What with the still-depressing state of the economy, the war in Afghanistan, and Michael Strahan starring in a sitcom, it seemed as if we all needed a pick-me-up. So we decided to make October our Feel Good Issue. The cover featured Matt Damon, a celebrity who wants to make the world feel good( " The Celebrity Shall Save You "), and inside was a series of articles that focused on ways to make yourself -- and others -- happy. This should be called the Feel Great issue. From the 75 Best People to the Bill Clinton interview( " Then and Now ") to the profile of Matt Damon to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) -- it was all amazing. MATTHEW SIPLE Las Vegas, Nev. I feel so good after reading this issue. Now that I 'm back in Australia, Esquire has become my eyes and ears in the U. S. Along with the interviews with Clinton and LeBron James( Man at His Best), Tom Junod 's eye-opening article on Barclays Capital CEO Bob Diamond( " The Deal of the Century ") made me nostalgic for my days in the U. S. of A. And then there was the piece on one of our hottest exports, Abbie Cornish. You 're welcome, by the way. NICK ZILBER Sydney, Australia I was feeling pretty good -- until I got to page 177, where I saw a quote from that twit Rod Blagojevich( " The Good News Pages "). I ripped out the page, crumpled it up, and recycled it. Now I 'm feeling good. JOHN MCDONALD Fishers, Ind. " Close this magazine. Stand up. Flush. " That line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the funniest I have ever read in the most important room in my house. So simple a solution for my leg falling asleep on me, yet it took Katz to make me really understand the remedy for what aches my old frame. And I do feel better now. CHRIS GAUVIN Whitby, Ontario... WHICH APPARENTLY IS N'T WHEN YOU 'RE READING ABOUT THESE GUYS Using highly scientific criteria -- people we 'd like to have a beer with and would trust with a puppy -- we determined the 75 Best People in the World( October). No one on your 75 Best People list could be more inappropriate than Rachel Maddow. Far from a " whip-smart voice of reason, " she comes across to most viewers as a snarling, sneering Obamaslurp who is anything but a balanced journalist. JOHN JAFFE Orefield, Pa. I must respectfully disagree with including Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell. You stated that he proves that not every " macher need be a pig or a prick. " Using his state employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ libraries financial difficulties seems a bit prickish to me. BENJAMIN MICHAEL York, Pa. I admit, I would like to have a drink with Rahm Emanuel. But would you really trust him with your puppy? The first time it disobeyed him, he would claim it was Republican and stab it to death with a letter opener. RYAN SKOGG Minneapolis, Minn. TO AVOID FURTHER CONFUSION : WE MEAN KENNY ROGERS THE SINGER, NOT THE PITCHER You included " Islands in the Stream " in " The Esquire Box of Permanent Joy "? People wonder why Papa Hemingway offed himself. Some say it was his closeted homosexuality. Some say he could n't write anymore. I say it was Islands in the Stream. RYAN SCHRECK Walla Walla, Wash. Actually, we meant the Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers duet, which they first sang together in 1983. Since that was more than twenty years after Hemingway 's suicide, either Parton and Rogers were brilliant and murderous time travelers or this is all a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the October issue, writer at large Tom Junod wrote about the multibillion-dollar purchase of Lehman Brothers, a deal that enabled one bank and one banker -- Barclays and Barclays Capital CEO Bob Diamond -- to emerge from the meltdown of the financial industry with more money and power than ever before( " The Deal of the Century, " October). I read all the stories and fun stuff in this month 's edition of Esquire with the exception of " The Deal of the Century. " I just do n't like finance.( Understand, I can barely balance my checking account.) But then I caved and read it. I could n't put it down. It read like a best-selling novel, and it did it without aliens, drugs, vehicle chases, or Freemasons. Junod should be appointed Chief Financial Learning Officer for the U. S. and its financial partners. RICHARD LE BURKIEN Sacramento, Calif. COMPLIMENTS FOR " THE PERFECT COMPLIMENT " Also in October, writer at large Tom Chiarella examined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it right( " The Perfect Compliment "). I was riveted to my chair as I read this article. One compliment Chiarella gave especially spoke to me as a dad. He told a man, " I like the way you speak to your son. My experience, that 'll always serve you, and him. You 'll be men together because of that. " My dad spoke to me in the same way that father was speaking to his son, and it made me a better man, father, and person. I took real joy in Chiarella doing what most people consider a waste of time : being human to other humans. DANIEL ASHCROFT Beaumont, Tex. Chiarella is astounding, and every article he 's written has been a treat. This was no exception : thought-provoking, personal, and motivational. JARRET BLUM Reston, Va. A BETTER MOLESKIN I agree with Nick Sullivan 's endorsement of moleskin pants( " Things That Actually Feel Good, " October). About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Australia where the weather was only cool enough for moleskins in the winter, I bought a pair that lasted almost fifteen years. I 've since moved to Washington, where the weather is moleskin-appropriate nearly seven months of the year. I tried other brands : definitely second-rate. Then I stumbled on an outfit in New Zealand called Tussock Creek. I 've ordered three pairs so far, and they 're the real deal -- for only eighty-five dollars, including postage. RICHARD LYNAM Vancouver, Wash. A HOLIDAY GIFT FOR MICHAEL SAVAGE You should check out Ashley Force Hood. She is an NHRA drag racer and would make a good Woman We Love. Additionally, do n't you like that Oreos and Chips Ahoy cookies started coming in those peel-back packages? This may be the Best and Brightest idea of the year. Well, maybe not. But at least it 's a great improvement in cookie access. MICHAEL SAVAGE Hackensack, N. J. Those cookie packages are indeed ingenious.

The other day my father was invited to lunch, and I declined to go. After his four-hour lunch, he came back and gave me a note card with something written on it.

But maybe you would n't mind talking to Mr. Lim? -- Editors Since you 're my favorite magazine, and since this question involves your name, I thought I should ask you : A woman at my company added the title " Esq. " to her e-mail signature. From everything I 've found in my research, this title is used exclusively by men. Is there a precedent for a woman to use the title, or is she simply incorrect to do so? PHIL COMBS Kettering, Ohio Three hundred years ago, you 'd have been spot on : According to the Oxford English Dictionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the title was reserved for men. Now, though, it probably just means she 's an attorney. Or a Wyld Stallyn. -- Editors Just as I suspected, my wife reads Esquire. And I found proof : A last-minute invite to a potluck apparently called for pulling out all the stops, because I stumbled upon a cutout of Minor Catastrophe No. 38 : You 've Been Invited to a Potluck( Man at His Best, July 2008) sitting by her purse.

How to Impress a Woman BY CHEFTHOMAS KELLER This month, Thomas Keller, the chef behind such lauded restaurants as the French Laundry, Per Se, and Ad Hoc, let us cook for him( " Does It Matter If It 's an Eighth of a Cup?

In case you 're cooking for your girlfriend( instead of a world-renowned chef), he offered some helpful tips for that scenario, too. 1 COOK CHICKEN A perfect roasted chicken fills your home with a wonderful aroma.

Before she gets there, boil green beans for a few minutes and place them in a bowl of ice water. Then, as she sits with a glass of wine watching you work, mince a shallot and toss the beans and the shallot in a saut pan with butter. 3 INVOLVE HER Ask her to participate in some small way. Even just pouring a drizzle of olive oil on the salad. Interaction is good. 4 USE LINEN No paper napkins tonight.
