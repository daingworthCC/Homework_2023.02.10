4084841 These Charming concepts are worthy of becoming tried and true &shy; traditions. 1. And the Bridesmaids Wore White What It Is : The bride 's attendants donning dresses in that oft-forbidden color family : ivory, cream, and white. Why We Love It : It looks unbelievably elegant and chic, and it 's flattering. Plus, the bride gets points for being confident enough to stand alongside other women in white on her wedding day. As Jessica Gorsky, a bride who got married last January in Manhattan, puts it, " I 'm not insecure. I always knew I wanted a winter white wedding, and I always wanted white bridesmaids dresses. " The white Jenny Yoo ensembles her bridesmaids wore ranged from one-shoulder goddess gowns to flowing strapless numbers. They could have passed for brides themselves, but as Jessica points out, " I was wearing a big enough dress that I would stand out anyway. " The Details : Most designers make styles in white, though offerings vary from season to season. -- jamie rosen Do n't miss these collections : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COREN MOOREcorenmoore.com 2. Themed Welcome Bags What It Is : Small offerings for out-of-town guests that highlight the place or mood of your wedding. Why We Love It : We all get oddly excited about that gift bag waiting for us at hotel check-in -- especially if it contains more than the standard Advil and bag of peanuts. The Details : The trick with a welcome tote is to make the elements reflect the locale without getting too kitschy. Though many brides whip up bags themselves -- a simple trip to Target will get you mass quantities of flip-flops, sunscreen, and margarita mix for your beachside reception -- you can get one more thing off your plate by hiring one of the new custom bag companies that ship throughout the country. Navy &; Lavender cofounder Michal Mufson offers pre-packaged city-themed welcome totes.( A " City of Angels " bag, for instance, offers California-themed playing cards and " movie theater " gourmet popcorn, among other items, for about $36.) And brides can customize them with various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a favorite shop, or a local sweet, " says Mufson, who then procures all the elements. The bags themselves can be personalized too ; for a groom who played in a mariachi band, Nancy Amster Owen of Austin-based Favors You Keep added a mariachi costume to the image of the groom on one tote. -- sarah height 3. A Bridal Party Uniform What It Is : Some brides like to spend the day of their wedding preparing in the company of their bridal party ; this is a cozy outfit for the group to wear while they 're getting ready together. Why We Love It : It 's another way to say thank you to the people who escorted you to countless prenuptial events and appointments. The unified dress code will look great in pictures. And post-wedding, your friends might actually wear it, which is more than we can say for that bridesmaid dress. The Details : Give the outfits to the bridal party at the rehearsal dinner or as soon as they arrive to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venue, the climate, and your taste into consideration ; silk robes, zip-up hoodies, tailored pajamas, and yoga pants are all good options. Most important, remember to choose something that can be easily removed without messing up just-applied makeup and finished hair. j.r. For the Preppy Bride Crisp pink cotton pajamas with pink piping from NATORI( $125 set) For the Downtown Bride Blue FREE CITY hoodie( $215) with T BY ALEXANDER WANG sweatpants( $120) For the Romantic Bride Cotton and sherpa robe( $68) from NATORI For the Sporty Bride LULULEMON stretch leggings( $92) and hoodie( $118) 4. Edible Vessels What It Is : Hors d'oeuvres that are entirely edible -- no pesky spoons or toothpicks to deal with. Why We Love It : What 's worse than being distracted during a conversation because you ca n't find a place to put your trash? The Details : Not long ago the hot new thing in hors d'oeuvres was serving them via chic glassware and utensils : tuna tartare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot glass, shrimp ceviche on a ceramic spoon. But as adorable as those delivery methods can be, they have the fatal flaw of leaving guests with an object they 're soon desperate to discard. " Even skewers! " laments New York caterer Thomas Preti. " We 'd do something on a skewer and we 'd end up finding dozens of skewers in potted plants at the end of the night. So now the idea is to make every single vessel edible. " For Preti 's cult favorite offering -- buffalo chicken bites -- he uses a spear of celery instead of a toothpick ; for tuna tartare or anything else requiring a similar hand-to-mouth delivery system, he crafts a cracker spoon or cone out of tuile batter. Vegetarian creations might come in carved-out zucchini segments, and Preti is testing new innovations constantly. " It 's just so much more pleasant for the guests, " he says. " Plus, it 's environmentally friendly. " -- danielle stein 5. Straight-From-the-Garden Centerpieces What It Is : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succulents arranged in ceramic pots or wooden boxes. Why We Love It : It 's a smart extension of the farm-to-table food movement. The Details : " Many couples want decoration that will last longer than just a day and that their guests can take home, " explains Jill Rizzo of San Francisco florist Studio Choo. An overgrown bunch of basil in a brightly colored dish can lend a rustic vibe to a table, while incorporating herbs into place settings -- a bundle of chives tucked into burlap, for instance -- offers a ready-made party favor. Herbal and edible decorations are showing up in many florists ' repertoires. " We shop the farmers markets for amazing things like raw dates on the stem, red burgundy okra, romanesco, and saturn peaches, " says Holly Vesecky of Holly Flora in Los Angeles. Yet while brides will be checking the sustainability box with farm-picked tablescapes, they should n't expect a boon to the budget. Says Vesecky, " Surprisingly, herbs cost about the same as fancy imported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What It Is : Food trucks offering tasty parting gifts. Why We Love It : It 's a cheeky way to end an event otherwise marked by hyperelegance and high-concept food. The Details : Gourmet trucks are suddenly all the rage, and many will personalize their snacks for wedding couples. Coolhaus, the popular homemade ice cream sandwich truck that was founded in Los Angeles in 2009 by Natasha Case and Freya Estreller, now does one to three weddings per week( and is expanding its operations to Austin, Texas, and New York City). Coolhaus allows couples to put their own logo, photo, or message on edible wrappers that encase the sandwiches. They 'll also create custom flavors and do pre-event tastings. d.s. 7.

The Afterparty What It Is : Keeping your wedding reception going by relocating to a nearby watering hole. Why We Love It : Because you want this day to never end. Plus, when else will you be able to traipse around the real world in a wedding gown? The Details : It 's fun being the center of attention at your venue, but it 's equally exciting to venture out, dress and all, for some carousing. The ideal destination will be open late, with dancing and a late-night menu. You also want a place that takes reservations, at least informally -- you do n't want your revelers waiting in line outside -- and that is n't scared off by a wedding group.( Some venues, we found, will deny a bride entrance, since dress damage could result in a pricey liability dispute.) With all this in mind, we located top options across the U.S. Chicago Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think wood beams, exposed brick walls, and a carved-wood fireplace -- that seems made for late-night revelry. The bartenders pour seasonal cocktails and thirty craft beers on tap, the kitchen offers sopressattas and potted rillettes until 2 a.m., and a DJ comes in on weekends to spin everything from Steely Dan to indie pop icon La Roux. It 's casual, so your party will be met with bemusement, but not so pubby that you 'll be worried about ruining your dress. 312-266-2277 Dallas Sfuzzi In its heart, Sfuzzi is a pizza place. But after midnight it transforms into a laid-back lounge serving a good selection of wines, cocktails, and wood-fired pizzas until 3 a.m. Candy-colored lanterns light the casual outdoor patio. The lounge itself has chintzy couches and walls hung with gilded mirrors and black-and-white prints.

Keep the wedding party dancing on the second floor, where the beautiful people convene. But beware the strict door policy : you will have to reserve a table and bottle service in order to get your large party in. 323-462-1307 New York City Lobby Bar at the Ace Hotel Financiers, hotel guests, and hipsters can all be found at the Bar at the Ace Hotel on any given night.

Book a few tables at Taverna Aventine, a new bar in the city 's historic Barbary Coast neighborhood.
