2031941 <p> MY MOTHER ASSURED US SHE COULD BEAT THE CANCER. HOW WE -- AND HER DOCTORS -- FAILED HER AS SHE FOUGHT AGAINST THE DISEASE. <p> " THIS LETTER HAS TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT thing I 've ever had to do because you and Dad are the last people in the world to whom I would give pain.... Please try not to be too upset. " <p> By the closing line, I was leaning against a Parisian mailbox, heart and head pounding. It was an early morning in September 1983, and I had begun a yearlong fellowship in France. The letter was from my mother. <p> " Things, " I had just read, " have been very hectic in the three weeks since you 've been gone and I 'm just going to have to blurt it out to you, but you must understand that all will be well in the long run. On August 21,1 was admitted to West Penn Hospital in Pittsburgh for a mastectomy of the right breast and biopsy of the left, both on August 22.... Lab reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on August 26. <p> " David dear, the doctors say my chances for complete recovery and total remission are 85 percent, so the odds look pretty good. " <p> As she wrote those words, and without knowing it, my mother was dying. It began with a single, healthy breast cell that mutated into cancer. That cell split into two. No one will ever know why or when, but it could have happened as long as a decade before she discovered the disease. For years, as she worked, slept, made love, mothered her children, the malignant cells were slowly doubling within her breasts until, unstoppable, they became billions. <p> The youngest of three and her only son, I adored her when I was a child. Later, after my teen rebellion, we grew closer, especially as her illness spread. Yet, while cancer overtook the woman who was the soul of my family and the moral center of my life, I did not involve myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or look at a magazine or newspaper story about breast cancer. As a journalist, I 'm used to asking strangers intimate questions and dissecting complex issues. But I could not have asked or answered the most basic questions about the disease or its effects on her. What kind of chemotherapy did she have? Was her treatment correct? What were her options? Had she taken every precaution? <p> As a horrible disease ravaged my mother and millions of other women, as it steadily took her life after taking her breasts, I watched passively. As she fought to survive, I waited, simply assuming she would get better. <p> On July 10, 1988, at 3:18 A.M., Esther Schrieberg was found CTB, as the doctor 's notes put it. A hospital social worker, my mother had always found that medical term repugnant. For a reason I 'll never know, I woke up at about that same hour on a summer morning three years later, wondering exactly whose mistake had led her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN 1980, MY MOTHER SPOKE OF THE LUMP in her breast for the first time to anyone other than my father. The woman was her housekeeper, who had discovered a breast tumor of her own. Stop worrying, my mother assured her. She had had her own lump for a while and her doctor insisted it was nothing to be concerned about. " Mine has stayed the same size, " she told the caller. <p> This was not my mother 's first lump, nor her first brush with the fear of breast cancer. Twenty years earlier, she 'd had a benign cyst removed from her right breast. In the interim, her sister-in-law had a mastectomy, her sister had two mastectomies, and a close friend died of the disease. <p> Those experiences, two near-fatal heart attacks, and her work in a hospital made her cautious about her own health. After finding the small tumor near the nipple of her right breast, she followed the advice of her trusted doctor, Reynaldo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania town. He had been the family physician for nearly a decade. <p> Laureano watched it. She watched it. As precious years passed, neither did anything about it. It is a story repeated time and again, usually bitterly, by women who eventually discover they have breast cancer. Among health activists and people who study the disease, it is called the " wait and see " syndrome. By the time someone decides to take action, it often is too late to repel the cancer 's attack. <p> My mother 's sister and sister-in-law were closest to her. They both ran to their doctors when they found their lumps. Immediate biopsies led to early mastectomies and survival. Years before, my mother had helped them through their cancers, and, as their friend, often shared with them secrets of her private life. Yet, she told neither about her own lump until a biopsy three years after she discovered it. Her sister was livid. <p> Oddly, three years went by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even had a mammogram, a breast X ray far more effective than a physical exam in unmasking a lump as suspicious. At the time, the American Cancer Society recommended that women over fifty have mammograms every year. She was then sixty-one. It was her first mammogram in sixteen years, the second in her life. <p> This, almost more than any other aspect of my mother 's disease, has haunted me since the night I awoke and began asking questions. How could she have done this to herself? How could she, with her personal and family medical history, have neglected to have a mammogram for so long? In the mountain of material I have amassed over the past year, I stumbled across the only explanation that seems to make any sense. It was buried in an editorial in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. <p> " Surveys continue to document women 's widespread lack of willingness to comply with recommendations on breast self-examination. Their reluctance is not surprising. We are asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bodies that will result in some degree of mutilation. We are asking women to try hard to find cancer in themselves. " <p> Despite intense media interest in the disease recently, for decades breast cancer was a " condition " that neither women nor the press discussed in anything above a bare whisper. There were many reasons : its location in an organ that is a sexual icon in western societies ; the social stigma that all cancers carry ; a medical community controlled by paternalistic doctors ; a research community with priorities other than women 's health problems. <p> The mammogram done on dune 30, 1983, at first came back negative. Esther Schrieberg 's breasts were " normal. " A day later, however, the radiologist sent along an " addendum " : in the right breast, he had detected " a small curvilinear-shaped area of increased density. " <p> On Friday, August 6, 1983, Dr. Robert McKee, a local surgeon, took twenty-three minutes to cut out the suspicious shape. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before leaving for Paris, my mother was preoccupied and told me about the biopsy. I told her not to worry ; it must be benign. <p> A week went by. As I was packing on the night before my departure, she sat on my bed in the room where I had grown up. She was watching me in rare silence when I suddenly remembered. She answered quickly : <p> " It was negative. " <p> THESE WERE MY MOTHER 'S PARTICULARS AT THE TIME SHE WAS diagnosed with breast cancer : age sixty-one ; white ; history of benign breast lumps ; Jewish ; affluent ; postmenopausal ; first menstruation at age eleven ; sister of a woman who had cancer in both breasts before menopause ; resident of the urban, northeastern United States. Any woman over thirty is considered at risk of contracting breast cancer. But my mother 's characteristics together placed her, statistically, at far higher risk for contracting the disease. <p> Breast cancer, like many diseases, is a numbers game. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records, medical studies, and mortality tables and from federal, state, and local reports. Over time, the data show, the " incidence " of the disease -- the number of new cases in every 100,000 women -- has been rising dramatically, while the death rate has not fallen. The pattern is global. <p> " It is the leading cause of cancer death in women throughout the industrialized world and in many developing countries, " a group of German researchers wrote in a 1990 study published by the New York Academy of Sciences. " It is one of the main causes of premature loss of life in women throughout the developed world. "( The United States is among those countries with the highest incidence.) <p> In the United States, it is the most common cancer among women and second only to lung cancer, among all cancers, in killing them. Although somewhat controversial as a measure, the often-cited figure is that 1 in 9 American women will contract breast cancer in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 in 11 in 1991. Devra Lee Davis, an epidemiologist and scholar-in-residence at the National Science Foundation, says that the figure may well rise to 1 in 7 by the end of the decade. <p> The numbers numb. The General Accounting Office, an investigative wing of the U.S. Congress, estimates that 1.5 million American women have breast cancer right now and do n't know it yet. Nearly one-half of them, about 750,000, will certainly die of the disease. This year alone, 180,000 will learn they have breast cancer, and another 46,000 who already know will die as a result. <p> More government money is spent studying this disease than other major cancers, although far less than is spent on AIDS. As with AIDS, for years politicians ignored this rising epidemic. But taking their cue from AIDS activists, increasingly vocal breast-cancer groups have turned their anger on Congress and on state legislatures. They, in turn, have funneled more resources into research on treatment and cure. <p> Yet, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding breast cancer and its causes and prevention continue to plague researchers. The disease remains, in effect, a medical mystery. No one knows how or when it begins ; why certain treatments work for some women and not for others ; which treatment will work for a particular patient ; why certain women survive it and many do not. <p> Nobody knows even what triggers it. Nine of every ten lung-cancer patients can at least blame their own smoking. Breast-cancer patients can blame nothing for sure. All the identifiable risk factors combined still only account for about 25 percent of the cases. In other words, three-quarters of women who suffer the disease have none of the known risks -- for example, family history or diets high in saturated fat. Many experts believe their cancer is launched by poisons in the environment, but there is little research in that area. The gaps in knowledge and the inability to stem breast cancer 's onslaught make it one of humanity 's cruelest diseases. <p> To be sure, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the disease 's genetic patterns and are now uncovering some of its molecular secrets. Doctors, meanwhile, can offer increasingly sophisticated chemotherapy, precise radiation targeting, and hormonal drugs such as tamoxifen, which blocks the effects of estrogen on breast-cancer cells in some women. But advances aside, the fact is that the disease continues to resist most attempts to destroy it. <p> No fact is more telling than this : when a breast-cancer patient begins her treatment -- be it mastectomy, lumpectomy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or radiation -- her doctor can not know for certain whether she will be cured. When the surgeon severs her breast, the doctor does not know whether the operation will ensure her survival. If only one cancer cell has already escaped, it will almost surely multiply. Once breast cancer spreads, it becomes incurable. " Women walk into your office, " one frustrated oncologist told a government researcher I interviewed. " Some are curable. Some are not. What distinguishes these groups, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Marc Lippman, one of the country 's leading breast-cancer researchers and director of Georgetown University 's Vince Lombardi Cancer Research Center, offered a dismal analogy, placing the collective knowledge about the disease in its grim context : A doctor treating a breast-cancer patient is like a caveman trying to stop a speeding car by beating on it with his club. " That 's more or less the state of the art, " he said. Another measure of the disappointing progress : He said this in 1990, seven years after my mother was diagnosed with the disease. <p> MY FATHER, ELI, IS FIXING US DINNER AS I THUMB THROUGH MY mother 's medical records. I am dragging him back through forty-four years of their history together. <p> My parents ' four and a half decades were not easy and were far from simple. Both were refugees from troubled childhoods, and their early marriage was built on mutual respect and love. But with the years, their relationship foundered at times on the shoals of serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never doubted that they loved each other deeply. But my mother suffered in the later years of their marriage from my father 's inability to open himself to her. And while his support for her throughout her battle with cancer was both unstinting and admirable, my father could not discuss his fears with her or allow her to discuss hers with him. In many ways, his emotional armor left my mother feeling lonely much of the time. <p> " When I try to force him to talk about it, he tries to kid, " she complained at one point. " There is a barrier there that I can not get him to verbalize on. And I wish I could. " <p> Still he is remarkably good-natured and honest as I dredge up the past, especially considering that he has been frozen in grief without her, unable to move on with his life. I am checking the files against his memory. We are baffled over the lump. He was the only one in the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might hurt her by touching it, his attitude toward it was as benign as hers. <p> Breasts had always been a source of humor in our family. All the women had small breasts, and jokes about bust size were frequent. My father said he used to tease Esther about not even having a good handful, about being a size quarter-A. <p> " When she told me about the lump, she did n't appear to be disturbed about it, " my father tells me. " She did n't express any fear or apprehension. She just did n't seem that concerned. " At the time, he did n't see why he should be worried either. <p> Esther 's inability to face the lump and its implications obviously embarrassed her. Perhaps that 's why she did n't discuss it with anyone. When she met Dr. Peter Citrone, the surgeon who would perform her surgery, my mother said she had discovered the lump only two months before. Dr. Citrone smiled sadly when I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for at least three years. He is used to such lies. <p> " A lot of people tell me that, " he said. " ' It never hurt ' or ' It did n't bother me. " ' <p> On busy days, he performs three mastectomies. <p> MY MOTHER HAD LIED TO ME ABOUT HER BIOPSY. THE RESULTS actually showed that she had cancer of the right breast. But even worse news was ahead. When Dr. Citrone first examined her, he immediately noticed a dimple in the skin just below the nipple of her left breast and felt a firm mass beneath it. He also detected swelling in her lymph nodes. All of these findings were potential signals of cancer. <p> My mother was stunned. Neither she, her internist, the first surgeon, nor the mammogram had found a second lump. Four lines of defense had failed. Dr. Citrone scheduled a biopsy on the left breast together with the mastectomy of the right. <p> On August 21, she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement, none of her family discussed the implications of what was to come. My father was afraid to face it, and Esther was keeping everybody calm. She appeared to be unafraid. <p> Early the next morning, Dr. Citrone first performed the biopsy on the left breast. When he uncovered the mass, he found it was " attached to the underlying pectoralis muscle, " meaning it had attacked nearby tissue. He removed it and moved on to the mastectomy of the right breast. The breast and the biopsy were then sent to the lab. <p> While the surgical team waited, the pathologist concluded cancer twice. This was not just disease that had spread from one breast to the other. Although the tumors were relatively small, my mother had two distinct breast cancers. Worse still, it had entered four of the lymph nodes on her left side, sharply raising the chances that it had traveled beyond her breasts. The pathologist notified surgery. <p> Dr. Citrone closed the incision. He motioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend of my mother 's from the lounge into the hall and told them Esther would have to lose her other breast. It was not what they had expected to hear. Each retreated into grief. My father, devastated, went to an empty office and, for the first time since learning his wife had a disease that could kill her, cried uncontrollably. <p> As she awoke from the anesthesia, trembling with cold, my mother assured her shaken family that she would " win. " Four days later, Dr. Citrone performed the second mastectomy, leaving his patient with a thin, neat scar and a boy 's chest without nipples. He had seen that the cancer in the left breast, the lump he alone had caught, was far more serious than the first. Its malignant cells had penetrated further. He thought he had found them all, but there were no guarantees. She would need both radiation and chemotherapy. <p> MY MOTHER WAS EXHAUSTED AFTER TWO MAJOR OPERATIONS IN one week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, twin shells that had always protected her, remained intact. She had beaten two heart attacks that could have killed her. Her sister and sister-in-law were still kicking, free of cancer decades after their mastectomies. Besides, she believed, as she wrote me in her letter, she had an 85 percent chance of " complete recovery and total remission. " <p> Dr. Citrone now thinks that the cancer had already invaded her body when he removed her diseased breasts. When he came out of surgery, he had doubts whether Esther would survive for very long. A week after the operation, her oncologist, Dr. Herbert Jacob, wrote a report : " Due to her axillary metastatic involvement and the bilateral chest disease, she is certainly at high risk for recurrence. Her prognosis is therefore guarded. " <p> This information was not shared with her family. Still, nobody who was with my mother ever heard any doctor say she had an 85 percent chance of recovery. Nor would any statistic available then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a SO percent chance of living for five years without a recurrence of the disease. Another measure of " progress " : her chances today would be no better. <p> She had invented new odds in her favor. This seems to have been her way of preparing for battle. <p> FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS, MY MOTHER SET ABOUT DOING WHAT had to be done. She had twenty-five radiation treatments to her chest wall to ensure that no cancer cells lingered. The discomfort was minor, but the daily stream of rays left her ragged. Over four months, she had eight " courses " of chemotherapy, chemical poisons taken by pill or injected through an intravenous tube into her bloodstream every three weeks. She suffered the indignities -- nausea, vomiting, and weakness -- after each treatment. <p> " I do n't look forward to it, " she wrote me with typical understatement as she faced her third chemo course in July 1984. " The last one was rough. " <p> She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Hours of reading mystery novels and watching television drove her wild. All her life, in work and at home, she had taken care of others. Now, my father had taken over the household, refusing to allow her to cook, clean, do laundry, or shop. Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune became the high points of her day. <p> My mother complained of becoming a " cancer cripple, " of being " bored out of her gourd, " as my sister put it. Her body had turned on her. It had taken control of her life, and that, even more than the illness, depressed her most. " She was starting to get really resentful, " my sister recalls. <p> But, in fact, she seemed to be winning. Her family and friends all marveled at how well she looked. Each visit to the doctor -- internist, oncologist, radiologist, cardiologist -- was encouraging, and reported to me with pride, as if her will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bones, skull, lymph nodes, liver, and spleen all came up clean. Finally, she was ready to go back to work. <p> I finished my year in France and moved to California in the fall of 1984 to start a new job. I spent a month with my mother and father before moving west. We talked about her cancer and agreed that, when death came, presumably many years from then, it would come from her heart condition. Meanwhile, life could return to normal. As always, my father teased her about the man she would marry after he was gone. <p> The teasing stopped on February 26, 1985. On that day, her oncologist wrote in his notes that my mother had noticed pain in her right leg. She had a full-body bone scan, which was compared with the two she had had since her mastectomies. I got a stunned call from my father. He said I had better come home. <p> " It 's not looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick and slow. " I do n't understand what happened. " <p> After seventeen months with no apparent disease, the cancer had spread into her bones, one of the most common targets of breast-cancer cells. Until then, the cancer appeared to have been removed along with her breasts. Suddenly, it seemed to be everywhere. <p> " There are multiple sites of abnormal activity not present previously, " the scan report concluded. " They involve left 4th, 5th, and 7th posterior ribs, both pelvic bones, left parietal skull region, and several sites in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine.... The appearance is compatible with metastatic disease. " <p> My mother was thunderstruck. She just had not felt that bad. Dr. Jacob started her on tamoxifen, a hormone drug not as commonly used at the time as it is today. Over the next few months, as her bones weakened, she began to have pain in her hips, neck, back, and shoulders. Walking became slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herpes infection, which wrapped across the surgical scar and around her back. She complained that it felt like a " saw " across her chest. <p> And so it went. One visit to the doctor was mildly encouraging, another was not. Through January 1988, each X ray or scan showed the disease moving steadily through her skeleton and skull. Dr. Jacob followed standard procedure, switching from drug to drug as one after the other failed to deter the rampaging cancer cells. He told her that only her will was keeping her alive. <p> Yet I do n't remember discussing death seriously with her during those three years. With most of the people around her, she still talked as if she would live forever. Over and over again, she said she could still beat it. I was more than willing to take her at her word. <p> I HANG UP THE PHONE, LIVID AND SHAKING with anger. For weeks, I have been trying to arrange interviews with the doctors, almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer. Though it has been three years, Dr. Jacob, her oncologist, remembers her immediately. Yet he is short-tempered and defensive. I beg him for fifteen minutes, five, whatever he will give. <p> " You do n't seem to be listening to me, " he answers, his voice tense. " The three hours a day I spend with my family is important to me and I do n't want to take away from that. " <p> His former partner, Dr. John Hill, refuses to meet unless I pay him his fee. My mother 's radiologist, Dr. Raymond Leen, never returns my calls. Of those who were involved in her ongoing cancer care, only Dr. Citrone, her surgeon, opens himself enthusiastically to my interrogation, perhaps because his own mother and aunt died of the disease. <p> My mother 's medical records are full of letters from many of these doctors, professional courtesy notes to each other detailing the latest steps in her treatment. Their letters infuriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her files They describe her as " very pleasant, " " delightful, " and " cooperative, " words that show how she made their jobs more comfortable for them but offer no insight into how she reacted to and handled their steady diet of bad news. <p> At times, their conclusions seem ludicrous. A bone scan on June 15, 1987, found the disease progressing undeterred, with new infiltration in her ribs. Dr. Jacob wrote in his notes that he had explained the report to her. She was, he jotted, " reassured, " and " happy with the results. " He underlined " reassured. " <p> These are men she 'd cared about, trusted, respected. Yet their words and phrases show no awareness of her as anything other than a patient they are slowly losing. Even as they chronicle her decline, they offer no sense that her decay is more to them than a professional disappointment. The word " unfortunate " appears often in their correspondence. <p> MY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he, characteristically, would not. Only with her sister-in-law could she speak openly. " I just want you to know I 'm petrified, " she told her after first learning the disease had spread. " I 'm scared to death of what 's going to happen to me. But I 'm going to fight it. " <p> The strategy was laid. She set short-term and long-term goals. Among the short-term was surviving to see her first grandchild, my son, who was born in December 1987. It was clear to those around her, before she and my father flew to California to meet him three months after his birth, that time was running out. <p> I was shocked when I picked my parents up at the airport. Her face was pale and drawn, her breathing heavy. She walked with a limp. During the visit, she delighted in her grandson, but even holding him was painful. Once, she dropped suddenly to the floor to play with him. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could handle the role she had long dreamed of for herself, as if everything were normal. But she needed my help to get back up. <p> During the weeklong trip, she readily agreed when I asked her to sit for a videotaped interview with a friend who produces family histories. I watched it only many months later. What got her through this illness, she explained to the camera, was " the idea that I was not going to be a whining, complaining wife and mother.... I do n't want my children to remember me that way.... I want my children to remember me as an active, useful human being. And that 's why I 've struggled so long. <p> " I 'm not afraid of death. But I 'm afraid of dying, if it 's going to be a slow, painful, elongated thing.... I had bounced back so well from the heart problems. I guess I began to start thinking in terms of my own immortality, and all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think in terms of mortality. And I just had to work that through. I do n't like the idea of the world going on without me. " She laughed. " I 'm a very curious person. " Even then, she was still talking life. Her long-term goal, she added, was to attend her infant grandson 's bar mitzvah, a rite of passage for a Jewish boy when he turns thirteen. <p> Several weeks after returning to Pennsylvania, Esther fell as she tried to rise from the sofa. She lacked the strength to stand. My father called an ambulance. In the hospital, her doctors discovered that the cancer had spread to her lungs and liver. Her kidneys were failing. Again, my father called me. <p> " The cancer is everywhere, " he said in a voice I could barely hear. " Laureano asked me what we want to do. " Neither of us would say it, but the implication was clear. This time, there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. She would never come home again. <p> When I stopped at their apartment on my way from the airport to the hospital, the force of that thought left me collapsed on the floor of the living room, hysterical with panic. This was no act of melodrama ; it was the only moment in my life when emotion overtook control, crowding out everything but grief. For the first time in five years, I allowed myself to feel the full force of her illness. In that instant, reality was permanently redefined. I would lose her to this ghastly disease, just as millions of others had lost and would lose their mothers, wives, girlfriends, daughters, sisters, and friends. <p> My mother lived for two more months. I spent several nights with her in her hospital room before she was moved to a nursing home ironically named Sugar Creek. I slipped ice chips through her cracked lips and stroked her forehead, as she had mine when I was sick as a child ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held her hand as we watched television, talked about how the family would handle her death, and just sat quietly. Esther made it clear she wanted to die on her own terms. No " heroics, " she insisted. <p> I was in California when she died, scheduled for a visit the following weekend. She had had a horrible day, the worst in a series of breathing attacks as the cancer filled her lungs. It was the first time anyone ever heard her admit defeat. <p> " I 'm sick, " she kept saying. " I wish this would end. " <p> At about midnight, a new nurse looked in on her. The attacks had ceased. Esther unnerved her, asking that she stop in often because she believed she would die that night. At 3:18 A.M., the nurse learned the power of her patient 's premonition. My mother was wearing her glasses and the sheets were smooth. At age sixty-six, she died alone, but calmly. All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My father, sister, and I have since been haunted by her solitude at that second. <p> We each have moments we can not let go. For my father, it is the instant he pretended not to understand when she asked him to move the tubes aside, crawl into her bed, and hold her. For my sister, it is knowing she would die that night but being too afraid to witness her death. For me, it is the icy, stone coldness of her forehead when I put my hand on it as her body lay shrouded in its casket. <p> " They 'll all survive, " my mother said of us during the videotaped interview. " People do survive these things. They survive death, illness, what have you. " <p> She paused. <p> " It will be more difficult for some than for others. " <p> I AM SITTING WITH DR. LAUreano in his examining room as he thumbs through his deceased patient 's records. From 1973 on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice. He is nervous. I have asked him who found my mother 's lump. <p> " Well, " he answers. " The lump was never really palpated felt. It was by mammography the diagnosis was made. It was so small that it was not palpable.... No time was wasted in following up. " <p> This is not true, but I change the subject. Why, I ask, had she not had regular mammograms? <p> He stares at the records. " With current standards, she should have had mammography once a year. " <p> Did she? <p> " No, she did not. " <p> Any idea why not? <p> " It does n't look like she ever did in the entire time I treated her. " <p> He seems at a loss to explain it. In fact, my father can not recall him ever recommending it. Do you ever remember a discussion about breast cancer with her before hers was diagnosed, I ask the doctor. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she wrote in her first medical history for him, and that increased her own risk. <p> " No, not as far as the record goes. No, I guess the emphasis was basically on the heart more than anything else. " <p> Should you have pushed the issue harder? <p> He bristles, catching my eye for the first time. " At that time, the feeling was not as strong as it is today. It 's always easy to be a Monday-morning quarterback. " <p> Since then, he offers, he 's learned to encourage his patients to get mammograms. I ask him why. <p> " The law. The law is if you find it late sometimes you can be liable for not finding the diagnosis early enough. " I am incredulous. The law, I repeat to myself. How about because it makes medical sense? How about because it made medical sense when my mother first came to you with a lump? How about because it might have given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its victims? <p> He is, like many doctors, ignorant of the recommendations of major medical groups concerning mammography. A 1990 national survey found that only 37 percent of physicians questioned followed the guidelines. In three major surveys, between 17 and 27 percent of the doctors had a simple reason for not pushing mammograms : they forgot. <p> Laureano allows me to copy my mother 's file. From 1973 until her mammogram in 1983, there is only one apparent reference to her breasts. On May 31, 1973, he wrote of his new patient : " Breasts : Symmetrical. There is a scar on the right breast from her biopsy in 1960. No palpable masses at the present time. " <p> SO I 'VE FOUND MY CULPRIT. <p> But have I? The more I think about it, the less I am sure. For three years, my mother and Dr. Laureano " followed " the lump in her right breast. But it was almost certainly the cancer in the left breast that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- no guarantee, but an indication that cancer from that breast was less likely to have moved throughout her body. <p> Had she taken care of herself, had a mammogram and a biopsy been done earlier, would someone or something have caught the left-breast lump? Maybe, but the 1983 mammogram never detected that lump. That 's not unusual. Even today, mammograms often give a " false negative " reading. <p> Had she had the right-breast mastectomy three years earlier, perhaps she would have had precautionary chemotherapy and thus been treating any new cancer that had already developed in the left breast. But precautionary treatment was not as widespread in that era as it is now. Chemo would not have been a certainty. <p> Maybe, then, nobody would have caught the left-breast cancer in time, and her pain and death were inevitable. Besides, had I known about her lump when she first discovered it, I doubt I would have played investigative reporter any more than I did when she was diagnosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and this was, and still is, a woman 's disease. <p> So, after a year 's search, I am left with nothing. During my research, I have realized that I never tried to imagine my mother 's suffering at her own mutilation, or to experience her fear and frustration with her unrelenting decline. She did not encourage me to do so either. Her approach, always, was to protect those she loved. After all, she had seen me off to Paris, forbidding anyone to tell me what was about to happen to her. I never opened myself to her pain. <p> Throughout my interviews for this article, I have been dogged by a vague yet intense sense of failure. Only as I write do I realize why. At the start of each encounter, I had an irrational idea that there was a key there, somewhere, that would unlock my mother 's cancer. If I could apply my professional skills and turn the key, she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time I had an advantage : I knew death was approaching. Armed with that knowledge, I might stop its arrival. <p> Neither in life nor death could Esther protect those she cared for from the truth : She had to die. Hers was a disease with no cure. Perhaps the saddest of all truths is that her genetic legacy, along with her sister 's, places both her daughters and her niece at higher risk of suffering the disease themselves. Each has had lumps. Each is terrified. <p> Esther 's decline and death were the fault of many : Dr. Laureano, for gross neglect of a patient who believed in him ; the medical community, for caring less about women 's health than about men 's ; the media, for sharing in that twisted priority ; my father, for not pushing her harder when he knew of her lump ; me, for not prodding her with my usual reporter 's skepticism about authority. <p> But ultimately, the blame lies with my mother. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did n't. Perhaps, in the end, caution would not have lessened the likelihood of her death. But who can say? She committed the cardinal and very human sin of trusting the men in white coats, the men with medical degrees. She trusted them to take care of her when she, above all, needed to take care of herself. Perhaps, for the first time in her life, Esther could not face its most painful cruelty : her own body had betrayed her. Instead, she chose to ignore the early signs of its revolt. <p> In my search, I have found no one who ever heard my mother cast blame for her disease and, ultimately, death. She never uttered the classic mantra of the cancer victim : " Why me? " More than anyone I have ever known in my thirty-seven years, she took responsibility for her life and her choices. We never discussed it, but now I think she knew the failure was as much hers as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that allowed her to die with the courage and dignity that meant so much to her. <p> Four years later, she helped teach me a final lesson. As I reviewed the notes of my interviews, I found a comment by a woman who had had breast cancer and had written about it. She never met my mother, yet she captured her better than I ever could. She clarified this loss, explaining the five-year nightmare that took my mother from life to death, that took her from all of us who still need her. <p> " It 's good your mother had a fighting spirit, " she told me. " But it 's good she recognized that there is such a thing as tragedy, unexplained tragedy. " <p> MY YOUNGEST CHILD, ETHAN, IS NAMED after my mother. One night recently, while I was giving him his bedtime bottle, we perched on the edge of the bed. Facing us was a wall of family photographs that chronicle five generations. Many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early life : as a baby, an infant, a girl, a college graduate, a newlywed. As I stared at that gallery, my son gently falling asleep in my arms, I thought of my mother 's disease, and I thanked a god I 'm not sure I believe in that I have no daughters. <p> ILLUSTRATIONS : <p> PHOTO( BLACK &; WHITE) : Esther Schrieberg told her son that she had an 85 percent chance of winning her war against breast cancer.

High-fat diets and alcohol intake are believed to be linked to some types of breast cancer. A low-fat, high-fiber diet is recommended. <p> The most important defense against breast cancer, however, is still early detection. All women over twenty should perform self-examinations monthly, to learn how their normal, frequently lumpy breasts feel and to check for abnormalities.( Your health-care provider, or the organizations listed below, can provide detailed information on how to examine your breast.) The American Cancer Society also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for women in their thirties, and yearly for women over forty. <p> Mammograms can sometimes detect cancers that are not yet palpable. Yearly mammograms for women over fifty are generally recommended, if equipment that minimizes exposure to radiation is used. They are not always effective in detecting cancer in women under fifty, because younger breast tissue is dense. <p> Resources : <p> Beast Cancer Action : P.O. Box 406185, S. F., 94146 ; 415/922-8279.
