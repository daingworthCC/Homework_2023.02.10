4111341 ' Can Tiger Woods Get Over Himself? ' <p> Perhaps what Tiger Woods needs is a bit more gratitude and fewer lame statements like " pure joy " and " at this point being a good father is more important... than being a great golfer "( April 9). Give me a break. I was glad to read Butch Harmon 's candid thoughts about his former swing-prodigy pupil : " When he controls his temper, it may be good for his image, but I do n't think it 's good for his golf. " <p> Hiram Rodriguez-Mora New York, New York <p> ' The Forgotten Jesus ' <p> Amen to Andrew Sullivan 's article on forgetting the church and following Jesus. I 'm a retired pastor who did just that. Jesus comforted the afflicted and afflicted the comfortable. Today the church ignores the afflicted, comforts the comfortable, attributes to Jesus things he did n't say, and is strangely silent on things he did say. <p> Charles W. Keller Hummelstown, Pennsylvania <p> If Sullivan wants to leave out what 2,000 years of humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take all the facts. Jesus did n't disown his parents. Even during his crucifixion he made provisions for his mother. And while true that he forgave adultery, he told the woman she must " leave her life of sin. " It was n't a " Jesus does n't mind adultery " blessing. His words are as valid today as ever, but we ca n't just pick what we like and disregard the rest. <p> Mary Lisa Cochran Glenwood, Minnesota <p> In his praise for Thomas Jefferson and Saint Francis, Sullivan overlooks the fact that deeply held convictions do n't mean these men are truer Christians. And pseudowisdom like " He possessed nothing -- and thereby everything " lacks as much substance as the sermons of the televangelists Sullivan decries in the first place. <p> Bernd Taschler, Graz, Austria <p> Sullivan articulates for me, in a way I 've struggled to do, what 's wrong with today 's religious climate. With growing dismay over self-described " Christians " who appear to be preaching intolerance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mote from thine own eye before worrying about the behavior of others. This indelible article will influence my future behavior. <p> Angelle Churchill, Elyria, Ohio <p> ' Call of the Wild ' <p> Theodore Roosevelt may have hunted back when elephants were not endangered, but there 's a glaring difference between him and the Trump men that was left out of your comparison : Roosevelt 's legacy to conservationism. He created several national parks and forests, protecting hundreds of thousands of acres of public habitat for the animals he hunted and respected. Let 's not romanticize the Trump men 's " thrill of the kill. " <p> Jennifer Irving Kochman Raleigh, North Carolina <p> ' What 's Your Tribe? ' <p> E.O. Wilson makes a good case for tribalism. Good, but incomplete. How does his theory of group selection account for the innovative individual? Most if not all great scientists, artists, and public leaders spoke, acted, and discovered things that often ran counter to their -- and any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lives of all people. Wilson 's theory needs augmentation and balance to account for such individuals. <p> Donald Tannenbaum Gettysburg, Pennsylvania <p> Correction <p> In " The Forgotten Jesus, " we incorrectly stated that Thomas Jefferson started editing the Bible when he was 27 years old. In fact he was 77 when he began the project. <p> ' Desperate Acts ' <p> Seeing the photo of Jamphel Yeshi setting himself on fire to fight for independence made me gasp and weep for those who live under oppression. The picture had such an impact that I felt like I 'd been hit with a blow to the solar plexus. What pain he must have experienced before dying of severe burns two days later. My parents fled China in 1949 and now live comfortably in the United States. I feel for people who resort to these desperate acts. What else can they do? <p> Annie Ko, Torrance, California
