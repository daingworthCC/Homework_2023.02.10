5007541 <p> It 's been less than 48 hours since HBO unveiled the first teaser with actual actors in it for the final season of Game of Thrones and some are already clamoring for more. The collective fandom has already pored over every detail of the new teaser to pick out tons of clues and callbacks, all of which we 've assembled in the article below. But is that it? Is that all we get as far as Season 8 promotion goes? No, do n't worry, show-runners D.B. Weiss and David Benioff have promised a full-length trailer with actual footage from the show is still coming. In fact, as thirsty as we all may be for a trailer, we 're on approximately the same promo time line as we were for Season 7. Both Season 7 and 8 featured teasers with just objects in them. Last time it was sigil statues, this season it was the painted table at Dragonstone. Then we got the trailers with actors but no actual show footage. Season 7 it was Dany, Jon, and Cersei marching toward their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stark kids and their tour of the Winterfell crypt.( Mercifully, there was no melting block of ice stunt to announce the premiere date this year.) <p> But back in 2017, the official full-length Season 7 trailer did n't come out until 53 days before the premiere so, by my math, we have until February 20 for HBO to deliver a Season 8 trailer and stay in the same time frame. In fact, several fans are hoping HBO is saving the trailer for this year 's Super Bowl which is on Sunday, February 3. After all, last year HBO shelled out for a Westworld Super Bowl trailer and that show is n't nearly as profitable as Game of Thrones. <p> Or will the Season 8 Game of Thrones trailer premiere in theaters in front of a big film like Captain Marvel? D.B. Weiss told Entertainment Weekly : " We went and saw Ready Player One with our kids and they played the Westworld trailer and it looked great. And we 're like, ' Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after both Weiss and Benioff said they wished they did n't have to release a full-length trailer at all, but that they absolutely will. Odds are Weiss and Benioff do n't want over-eager fans scrutinizing footage and learning too much about the highly secretive final season. Whatever would give them the idea that we 'd do that? <p> Unrelatedly, here are the many, many spoiler-free Easter eggs, theories, and callbacks you might have missed in that 89-second teaser. <p> The Lone Wolf Dies but the Pack Survives : Initially George R.R. Martin intended to call the final book in his A Song of Ice and Fire saga A Time for Wolves instead of the current planned title A Dream of Spring. On the one hand, that title could reference the literal role direwolves may have to play in the final battle for the Seven Kingdoms.( A popular fan theory has the surviving Stark-family pets showing up to save the day.) But, of course, the real meaning has everything to do with the surviving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other players still on the board in the HBO series, that Jon, Arya, and Sansa should be at the center of this promo. We see them walk past statues of Ned, Catelyn, and Lyanna Stark before confronting stone versions of themselves. <p> Last season, both promo material and the finale itself leaned heavily on a Season 1 Ned Stark quote : " When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives. " It 's a phrase so significant to the show, Sansa actress Sophie Turnergot it tattooed on her body. We 've spent a few seasons watching the re-united Starks bicker -- first Sansa and Jon, then Sansa and Arya, and early Season 8 info hints that there may yet be more bickering to come. But this promo should give Stark fans hope that however much Sansa may disapprove of Jon 's new blonde girlfriend, the pack will stand together when it needs to. <p> It 's also fun to see the wolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows in previous crypt scenes) in the light. Here, also, we see the encroaching threat of the Night King and his army of zombies represented by an icy blast of fog. That would be the blowing " white wind " Ned 's quote promised. But it also calls up another oft-repeated Starkism : Winter Is Coming. <p> Where 's Bran? : O.K.! The wolf-pack gang 's all here but where 's Bran? Some fans believe Bran is in the teaser -- in a way. That cold wind blowing signifies the Night King, but could it signify Bran as well? In case you are unfamiliar, there is a truly awful theory that Bran Stark is somehow, through a quirk of time travel, also the Night King. There are plenty of reasons why this theory is bunk and, similarly, there are a couple of good reasons why Bran is n't part of this Stark-family teaser. For one thing, by his own admission, Bran is no longer really a Stark. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the artist formerly known as Bran Stark. Best to call him the Three-Eyed Raven now. Also, if you add Bran to the mix, you lose the symmetry of three living Starks, and three dead. There are no other statues down there that audiences would be able to identify. It 's also perhaps worth mentioning that Bran 's lack of mobility would make it challenging for him to join his siblings stalking down the hallway. On the other hand, he could have joined them at the end of the hall, so I think the fact that Bran no longer considers himself a Stark is the significant meaning here. <p> It 's All About Jon : Despite all that discussion of Starks and packs, this promo is very Jon heavy. More specifically, it 's very Jon Snow-parentage heavy. When we watch the Stark kids walk down the hallway and hear lines of old dialogue spoken by their relatives, everything has to do with the fact that, A) Jon 's mother is secretly Lyanna Stark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and C) it forever turned his aunt Catelyn against him. <p> Lyanna 's dialogue -- " You have to protect him " -- is what she told Ned about Jon on her deathbed. <p> Ned 's line -- " You are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood " -- was a nimble half-truth he told his nephew Jon the last time he saw him back in Season 1. <p> Catelyn 's regretful, " Everything that 's happened since then, all this horror that 's come to my family... it 's all because I could n't love a motherless child, " was her Season 3 confession to Talisa about how she mistreated Jon. <p> One of the few tidbits Weiss and Benioff have shared with press about Season 8 is that a big part of the final season will involve Jon coming to terms with the news of his parentage. " From a dramatic standpoint, it makes things interesting, because the story is no longer about who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Jon finds out, " Weiss told TV Insider. So it 's a tidy bit of teaser-making here to not only show all the Winterfell crypt statues we might care about in Lyanna, Ned, and Catelyn, but also to show the actual parents of Jon, Sansa, and Arya. All that 's missing is Jon 's father, the Dragon. <p> Season 1 Callbacks : Speaking of old dialogue and wolf packs, this teaser underlines just how many callbacks we might wind up seeing in the show 's final season. Game of Thrones has always enjoyed its references to earlier episodes -- especially in these last few seasons without fresh George R.R. Martin-penned dialogue. Ca n't get new lines, why not just recycle some old ones? Early reports from Season 8 indicate that we might be in for even more nods to the past -- specifically reflections of Season 1. We 've already seen one major callback in the snippet of Season 8 footage where Daenerys met Sansa. The oldest Stark girl, quoting her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daenerys : " Winterfell is yours, your grace. " We get yet another Sansa-Robert connection in this teaser. <p> The feather that falls to the ground as Jon passes is one that King Robert himself put in Lyanna 's stone hands back in Season 1. We saw the feather again in Season 5 when Sansa picked it up while visiting her aunt 's statue and heard, from Littlefinger, the story of how Jon 's mother, Lyanna, caught the eye of Jon 's father, Rhaegar Targaryen. The image has already become iconic in the fandom. <p> In that first Season 1 feather scene, when Robert tells Ned that Lyanna 's statue should n't be down in a musty, old crypt, Ned replies : " She was my sister. This is where she belongs. " Where do dead Starks go? Right here. Lyanna 's feather gets crusted over with ice before the teaser is through. <p> One last thing which may or may not be a direct allusion to Lyanna. Many fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hair in braids not dissimilar from the ones we see on adult Lyanna in flashbacks. We get a good shot of Sansa 's hair in the teaser. <p> Jon 's " Old Statue " : Some fans have wondered if Jon 's statue in the teaser holds a clue to his survival. To be honest, fans are a bit used to freaking out over these statues at this point. Last year at New York Comic-Con, Sophie Turner said : " There 's this big kind of statue of me, of Sansa, and I wanted to have it in the garden of my new house. " Sansa lovers lost their minds thinking that this confirmed Sansa would die and wind up in the crypt before the show ended. That might still happen, but, more likely, the statue was made for this promo. Kit Harington also kept his stone doppelg? nger, telling the BBC 's Zoe Ball in an interview this week : " I kept that statue, you know the one in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got it in my shed laughing. How sad is that? " Ca n't wait to find out where Maisie Williams is keeping hers. <p> Anyway, so on the subject of Jon 's statue, some fans think it looks a good deal older than the ones of his sisters. Does this mean Jon survives the final season and lives to a ripe old age? Well, maybe. But remember that the Winterfell statue carver is n't very good at his job. That Lyanna statue looks nothing like the actress, for one.( Just kidding, of course they built that thing years before they cast the role and, wisely, production eroded her face significantly in Season 1 to cover any potential disparity.) More seriously, the Ned statue does n't look like Sean Bean at all. Arya and Sansa even commented on it in Season 7. " It does n't look like him. Should have been carved by someone who knew his face, " Arya says. " Everyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're not, " Arya concluded. <p> Needle is not only another nice Season 1 callback, it 's also a fitting symbol of Arya 's Starkish identity. Like her brother Bran, Arya was in danger of losing her connection to her family during her time away from Winterfell. The assassins in the House of Black and White tried to turn her into " No One. " But when Arya was supposed to give up all her earthly possessions, she held on to her Needle. When she needed to kill the Waif in order to survive, Arya did it with Needle. <p> And when she re-asserted her identity at the end of Season 6, saying, " A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell, and I 'm going home, " she did so with Needle in her hand. It seems a little unfair that Jon and Arya are armed in this Season 8 teaser while Sansa is not. But just because the older Stark girl does n't carry a weapon does n't mean she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their sides when they performed their big Season 6 " I 'm going home " exits, while Sansa 's hands were empty. <p> But out of the three, did n't she cause the most damage having just fed Ramsay to his own dogs? <p> Fire and Ice : It would n't be a symbolism-heavy Game of Thrones trailer without a little ice-meets-fire action, would it? In this teaser we see the Stark flames snuffed out as a nice nod to what happens when a White Walker meets fire. <p> And I suppose if we want to circle back to that( very bad) theory that the icy wind is supposed to signify Bran, then we can compare its creep down the hall to the last time Bran was down in the crypts in Season 1. Bran had a dream that he saw his father in the crypt( Ned was still alive then) and the wildling Osha obligingly took the Stark kid down to look. The two round the corner of the crypt entrance and stalk down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, illuminating the walls. No matter what you 're theory, it 's a sad visual to compare the Bran of old( the sweet-summer child with an encyclopedic knowledge of his dead Stark relatives) to either his complete absence or an icy fog. <p> That Music : Composer Ramin Djawadi composed an original score for the teaser, and while it 's mostly just a ghostly, choral version of the show 's beloved theme song, there 's an intriguing detail at the end. The teaser closes out with a lullaby-esque twist with what sounds like a child eerily singing the refrain. The last time Djawadi used young voices to make a massive impact on the score was at the end of Season 4 as Arya left Westeros and a children 's chorus kicked in with a version of the theme in the aptly named episode, " The Children. " <p> But what 's going on here? Is Djawadi once again merely invoking the Stark children as we watch the three of them brace for the oncoming storm? Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Season 8 plot many, many, many fans predict will happen. Season 7 heavilyforeshadowed that Daenerys will become pregnant with Jon Snow 's baby. Is this the little prince or princess that was promised singing the song of how her parents met? We 'll find out when Game of Thrones returns on April 14.
