4111141 Actress and model ROSIE HUNTINGTON-WHITELEY embraces the season 's tribal beat <p> ENGLISH ROSIE <p> The British model went from being a self-described Ugly Betty to the face of Burberry, the body of Victoria 's Secret, and -- thanks to Transformers 3 -- a star. <p> TO QUOTE THE IMMORTAL Derek Zoolander, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is " really, really, really, ridiculously good-looking. " She could be on the hood of a car, the head of a ship, or the super-hot female lead in a blockbuster about robots.( That, she 's done.) Huntington-Whiteley 's looks have made her famous -- as a Victoria 's Secret Angel and Burberry model and an actress in last summer 's Transformers : Dark of the Moon. The opening scene, directed by master of subtlety Michael Bay( who had previously worked with her on a VS commercial), involved a lingering close-up of her rear. <p> But according to Huntington-Whiteley -- who does a charming line in self-deprecation -- she was not always so fetching. " I was a bit of an Ugly Betty when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was, a teenager on a farm in Devon, England, dreaming of the glamorous life in London, when she took an internship at a modeling agency, " getting coffee, lighting people 's cigarettes. " It was n't until she visited the agency months later and met a new agent that she booked her first job. Not So Ugly Rosie would turn up at castings " in trainers, with braids, a ton of makeup, plucked eyebrows. " Sigh. " I had braces. " <p> The braces, and her baby fat, did n't stick around. Huntington-Whiteley 's " transition " period happened at 18, when she moved to New York and quickly scored a Victoria 's Secret deal. About those mythical wings, she says, " I 'd love to wear them for a fancy-dress party sometime. People assume I have wings hanging all over my house, but that, " she says reassuringly, " is not the case. " While the wings do n't exactly scream Steinem, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model. " She adds, " People kind of laugh about it and think it 's irrelevant, but I do n't know a girl in the world who would put those wings on and not feel, just for a split second, very special. " <p> Three years later, Huntington-Whiteley became the new face of Burberry. " To be 21, working with Mario Testino and Christopher Bailey, it was a milestone moment, " she says. This past fall, her bodacious Burberry Body billboard was splashed all over venues as diverse as Herald Square in New York and the Muse d'Orsay in Paris( giving new meaning to impressionism). How many trenches does a Burberry campaign earn a girl, anyway? " I counted the other day ; I have 12. " <p> Based in L.A., where she lives with her boyfriend, action star Jason Statham, Huntington-Whiteley is navigating her next transition carefully. " It 's interesting coming from modeling, where women rule the industry, into one where there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much higher. " <p> Now, though, Huntington-Whiteley has ascended to a level of celebrity where she can model ironically. At parties, she 's been known to rock a runway walk or two. " There 's always a moment when some great song comes on and everyone 's like, ' Do the runway walk, Rosie! ' And you 're like, ' No, no, no, ' and then you begrudgingly get up and do your thing. " But maybe she secretly loves it. " Yeah, it might be my little party trick. It always gets applause. " <p> For the newly minted actress, applause will surely come, and not just from fans of robots. She quotes one of famed coach Stella Adler 's theories on acting : " ' You have to have the skin of a rhinoceros ' -- just let go of everything. " <p> The skin of a rhinoceros, however, could swiftly kill a modeling career. " Yeah, " she says, chuckling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Fearless patterns and unexpected fabrics are leading the way.
