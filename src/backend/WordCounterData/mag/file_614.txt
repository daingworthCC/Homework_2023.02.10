4143441 Section : News # The Huntington Library www.huntington.org, in San Marino, Calif., has purchased a hoard of Civil War telegrams and ephemera, adding to its trove of Abraham Lincoln documents, the third-largest such collection in the world behind the Library of Congress www.loc.gov and Lincoln Presidential Library www.alplm.org. The messages, meticulously handwritten by telegraph operators and stored in 40 thick cardboard-bound ledgers, represent the day-to-day communications between President Lincoln and his generals, while smaller calfskin-covered code books offer a glimpse into Union cryptography. # The telegram collection was amassed by Brig. Gen. Thomas Eckert, who served as telegraph chief in 1862 for Maj. Gen. George McClellan 's Army of the Potomac, then ran the telegraph office at the War Department in Washington through war 's end. The library will display some of the books in upcoming fall exhibitions. #
