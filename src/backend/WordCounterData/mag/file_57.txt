Photograph // If a place belongs forever to the one who loves it best, then Horn Island belongs to Walter Anderson. For two entire decades, from the midforties to the mid-sixties, the Gulf Coast sea island served as subject and inspiration for the Ocean Springs artist. He journeyed there alone in all seasons and through all weathers. Sailing and rowing for hours at a time, often battling wind and tide, he would cross Mississippi Sound-10 miles of open water-in a bare-bones skiff scarcely longer than a canoe. Once there, Walter would stay for weeks on end, sleeping under his rough-plank boat, subsisting on fruit, rice, and canned goods and feasting on the island 's untamed beauty. Every day he would sketch or paint at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in graceful lines and bold colors, any image that blessed his eye -- birds, animals, shellfish, flowers, butterflies, wind-sculpted dunes, salt-stunted pines. With Horn as his singular muse, he produced thousands of drawings, watercolors, and words that lay bare the island 's wild soul. ON THE MAINLAND I first heard of Walter Anderson and Horn Island in the early eighties when I stopped into the split-level showroom of Ocean Springs ' Shearwater Pottery. There, on display, stood some of the stoneware he had decorated for the pottery business his brother, Peter, started in 1928. Struck by his elegant designs, I bought a silk-screened print-two regal pelicans perched side by side-and a hardback copy of The Horn Island Logs of Walter Inglis Anderson. The print intrigued me with its textured patterns ; the book-taken from the daily journals he recorded during his frequent island trips-enthralled me. He wrote eloquently of the island, of what he saw and experienced. I resolved to learn more about the man and visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " There are some wonderfully strange trees on Horn Island, " wrote Walter Anderson in his logs, " years of storm and years of sudden growth, one side retarded and the other growing like a vine.... " // Walter Anderson 's story is a complex one. Fired by a consuming passion to create and afflicted with manic depression, he followed an unconventional path. The closest thing he ever had to a regular job was at the pottery. Still, as years went by, he gave himself more and more to his private art and Horn Island, living between trips as a recluse in a ramshackle cottage at Shearwater. That self-imposed exile and his mental illness made life hard-for both him and his wife and children. Residents of Ocean Springs mostly regarded him as the local eccentric, watching his erratic comings and goings with amusement or, perhaps, disdain. His family and friends forgave his sad, strange isolation and left him to his work, but when he died in 1965 he was little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of art was the act of creating, not the result or the fame. Last year, when I at last returned for my Horn Island visit, I discovered just how remarkable and prolific he was. His daughter Mary Anderson Pickard, an artist in her own right, took over as curator for his estate in the seventies. To her fell the task of cataloging his astonishing body of work. " I got to the point where I actually felt that somebody must have been putting more things in, " she told me in her soft, melodic voice. " My brother had a huge closet in which everything was kept, and every time I 'd go to it I 'd find something that I did n't know was there. " She laughed, shaking her head in wonder. " That was my father 's bounty ; it was just like a fountain. " Determined efforts by Mary ; her mother, " Sissy, " before her ; other family members ; and a core of admirers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent years critics in such publications as Art in America and Smithsonian have compared his work to that of van Gogh, Matisse, and Georgia O'Keeffe. Indeed, he is regarded as a 20th-century American master, a first-rank watercolorist who possessed exquisite command of light and line. Nowhere do those gifts shine brighter than at the Walter Anderson Museum of Art in Ocean Springs. The museum 's modern exhibit halls, with cathedral-like vaulted ceilings and clerestory windows, connect two older buildings. Those structures themselves are literally the artist 's grandest creations. Entering the larger of the two, the town 's Community Center, struck me as an Alice-in-Wonderland experience. It was like stepping into a painting, for he had neglected not a single inch of the vast space. All four walls, floor to ceiling, of the 100-foot-long room vibrated with motion and color. Photograph LEFT : One of Walter Anderson 's grandest achievements is the mural he painted on the walls of the Little Room, now part of Ocean Springs ' Walter Anderson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One thing that has always struck me about this room is that everything glows. " ABOVE : Walter Anderson 's last boat anchors the museum 's Horn Island exhibit. // It took Walter Anderson 15 months to paint this massive mural, which he did as a public service in the early fifties for a sum of $1. It was, he felt, his civic duty to provide the public with quality art. His theme blended area history, mythology, and nature, and in the details -- pelicans in flight, a black bear climbing a honey tree, an alligator at rest, eagles locked together, everything -- I found the same repetitive use of patterns I so admired in my own print : circles, semicircles, spirals, diamonds, zigzags. " Mere are few rooms like this in America, " said museum director Clayton Bass as he introduced himself, " and that 's an understatement. " He explained how Walter Anderson employed those symbols as a visual alphabet to build images. " Anderson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life. His color sense is amazing too. Everything is very translucent. " All of these images are the result of careful observation, " Clayton continued, spreading wide his arms to take in the entire 360 degrees. " These really are certain kinds of flowers, certain kinds of plants. Even though he is very sure of hand and very quick in his depiction of things, he 's not just making it up. " The Community Center, his most public art, serves as prelude to his most private in the other of the two buildings. The Little Room, once a part of Walter 's Shearwater cottage, was n't discovered until after his death. It represents, however, the ultimate synthesis of his art and his devotion to nature. Stirred by the 104th Psalm, he used oils left over from the Community Center to trace the passage of a Gulf Coast day on its board walls. The room barely measures 10 paces wide by 12 long, but what he rendered there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the museum 's director, stands in a brilliant corner of the Community Center, whose walls were painted by Walter in the 1950s. Photograph Horn Island possesses miles of beach and inland trails to explore and enjoy. // Standing in the room 's center, I imagined him working by himself, slapdashing these brilliant, yet precise, images on the grainy wood, never slowing to correct the drips or runs of bright paint. The flares of a rising, orange-yellow sun encircle the east window. To either side, a pair of sandhill cranes and blue jays, colored to perfection, wing their way upward. The south window marks noontime. An arcing rainbow heralds storm 's end, and a doe, unmoving, stares out as if she has just spied me in the forest. Black skimmers dive past lightstained clouds toward the west window 's sunset, and across the north wall 's dark night flies a collection of vivid moths. " One thing that has always struck me about this room, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a kind of vibrancy, like an aura. He did n't just paint an object ; he painted the object, the space around it, and how the two interacted somehow. " He directed my gaze back to the single deer, outlined in flamboyant yellow. " He did n't just show you how the object looked ; he showed you how the object feels. He essentially painted the life force.

Making the trek to Horn requires advance planning, because there is no regular transportation to this wilderness island. Locals tend to visit the island on a day-trip basis, but camping is allowed. You just need to bring everything, including plenty of fresh water. The National Park Service awards licenses for charters to the islands.

Top : Ospreys, called fish hawks by Walter, nest on Horn. // The island stretches about 14 miles in length and ranges from 1/2 to 1 mile in width. Like most barrier islands, it consists of beach, dunes, marsh meadows, and a thin interior of scrub forest, ponds, and lagoons. A scarcity of freshwater, the intense sun, and rabid mosquitoes, gnats, and flies make Horn and its brethren less than hospitable in some seasons. It has been inhabited previously, but since being designated a wilderness area of the Gulf Islands National Seashore in 1978, it has been left to the wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service ranger. Tall, lean, and blue-eyed, John Anderson looks strikingly like Walter. Indeed, he inherited his father 's heart for the island, and for a time he served as Horn 's first ranger. He talked of that, his family, and the island 's almost mystical power as he steered the boat into the wind and the waves washed past the bow like a sigh. " As a teenager, " he remembered, " I sailed out here by myself in a small boat for a couple of weeks. It was a very tumultuous, intense experience, but I ended up with something that I feel has helped me a lot in life. I came back from that experience no longer an observer, but a participant. " That same transformative power touched Walter Anderson. " To Daddy, Horn Island was as much a state of mind as a state of place, " said John. " He got to heaven, to a kind of perfect peace, by going some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then being totally in that place. " We reached that place, the shores of Horn Island, just after the midmorning sun shattered a bank of low, gray clouds. AN ISLANDER 'S LOG " There are places on this island where they alone are worth coming to see, " Walter Anderson wrote in a log from February 1959. On a Saturday, five months later, he added, " One image succeeds another with surprising regularity on Horn Island. " He called those images " realizations, " regarding them as gifts from Providence. He scrambled to see and record such moments, and I found myself doing the same. We set up camp, a cluster of neat, small tents, by Teal Lagoon on the sound side of the island. The tidal water rushing through the lagoon 's shallow mouth ran clear and cool, a welcome contrast to the noon air. Hermit crabs, shouldering their cumbersome shells, stumbled along water 's edge. Many looked as fine as jewels, striped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such spindly creatures. Crossing the lagoon, we ambled toward the island 's east point, only to encounter the next broad stretch of beach, littered with the abandoned carapaces of horseshoe crabs. I picked up a small one, perfectly intact down to its spike of a tail. Thin as paper, brittle, and bleached to the color of faded parchment, it had the aspect of an ancient relic. Just behind the dunes rose a stand of tall pines. Alerted by the constant, highpitched cries of ospreys, we counted at least four huge nests, unkempt tangles of sticks and branches wedged in the treetops. We watched one bird return from the hunt, carefully circling to land with a flourish. In its beak was a mouse.

Then he would abruptly dive, snatch up his prey, and return with the silvery prize flashing into the afternoon light. Despite all the effort, the female remained unimpressed. The setting sun tried to dye everything orange : the sky above it, the water, the sand. It seemed for an instant all the earth was afire, except for a ragged purple band along the horizon. Later, near midnight, the wind quartered to the north, and my tent began to bow before the gusts. Awake, I walked along the shore to find phosphorescence in the water. Tiny meteor showers glittered across each breaking wave ; mesmerized, I watched for over an hour. Later I angled the tent so the breezes could enter through the door and exit by a window The wind sang me back to sleep. The next morning we hiked west down the island, then south across to the wide, empty outer beach. You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. We spied at a distance a pair of bald eagles, distinguished in silhouette, perched in a lofty pine that overlooked a tannin-stained lagoon. We swam in the blue waters and were joined by a school of cow-nosed rays. Moving in formation, they glided around us at an unhurried pace. Thrilled by the chance encounter, John 's friend, Linda Kerr, voiced my thoughts. " After spending time here, it 's easy to understand Walter Anderson. I yearn to come back. I always yearn to come back. " Photograph ABOVE : During his stays on Horn, Walter Anderson would wade and swim through the marshes and lagoons in search of subjects and experiences to paint.
