Refrigerator space is prime real estate, and an efficient, well-organized fridge actually enables you to find something good to eat--and quickly recognize when it is time to go shopping. # Samsung is helping consumers craft a more organized and efficient Christmas and New Year 's with its Make Your House Work for the Holidays. It covers everything from planning to cooking to cleaning up--and an organized fridge is a key part to success. # During the holidays, consumers spend as much as two hours per week at the grocery store, compared to just 30 minutes during an average week. That is a lot of food to squeeze into a refrigerator. Here are some tips to get you started on making more room : # * Toss out items past their expiration and commit to using nearly empty items like dressings, sauces, and marinades in your meals that week to make way for new. # * Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves, but the rims of bottles and condiments. A simple cleaning solution of two tablespoons of baking soda and one quart of hot water will not leave behind a scent that food can absorb. # * Divide the fridge into zones and assign a specific function to each shelf and drawer. Think about how the family reaches for snacks or prepares meals( dinner ingredients, lunch fixings, breakfast condiments) and organize accordingly. # * When you are pre-making foods in advance of the holiday meal, maximize space by using zipper bags for storage. Pie filling, cookie dough, marinade, and stuffing then easily can be stacked in the fridge or freezer, which cuts down on space used and prep time come the big meal. # Techno-savvy seniors do not have to drop in order to shop. #
