4145141 Section : MixedMedia Tig Notaro on cutting class, dipping tobacco, and joking about cancer # ONE EVENING last August, comedian Tig Notaro sat at home in Los Angeles, wondering what she 'd tell the crowd at the Largo club. Five months earlier she 'd fought off pneumonia only to be waylaid by a gut infection that siphoned 20 pounds off her scrappy frame. Then her mother died and her relationship crumbled. Through it all, she had managed to keep people laughing, but a diagnosis of stage II breast cancer the day before had left her at wit 's end. When the solution finally dawned on her, she could n't stop laughing. That night she bounded onstage, waving : " Good evening! Hello. I have cancer! How are you? " What followed " was one of the greatest standup performances I ever saw, " wrote Louis C.K., who posted the set on his website. Soon Notaro was everywhere. She did a segment on This American Life, landed a book deal, released a live recording, and, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with comedian pals Kyle Dunnigan and Amy Schumer to write Inside Amy Schumer, a series that debuts April 30 on Comedy Central. She 's also touring with Dunnigan and David Huntsberger, doing a live version of their popular weekly podcast, Professor Blastoff. I spoke with Notaro, 42, about her Huck Finn childhood, turning tragedy into comedy, and what to say to someone who has cancer.

What 's the premise? # Tig Notaro : The idea is that we found all this old radio equipment, and it used to belong to a professor who built a time machine and got lost in space. We communicate with him, and that spins us off into these topics. We bring in comedians or doctors, specialists, friends, musicians. It 's a curiosity conversation, basically. # MJ : Any especially eye-opening subjects? # TN : Hmm. We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and he was telling us how everybody dopes. That was interesting. But so many episodes were just ridiculously funny. # MJ : If doping is the practice of cyclists, what 's the practice of comedians? # TN : People will have after-parties for comedians, and they misunderstand us. They think it should be wild and crazy, and comedians are typically pretty mellow people that just want to talk to each other. # MJ : You were raised in Pass Christian, Mississippi, right? # TN : Yeah, and also outside of Houston. I was very into animals and nature. I used to wander off into the woods for hours. I 'd bring a clipboard and think that I was doing some work, following the trails of raccoons or collecting bird feathers. I was a full-blown tomboy. I was very mischievous and got into a lot of trouble. I started smoking probably when I was nine. My friends used to call me Huckleberry Tig. # MJ : What does a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find. My mom smoked Pall Malls. I used to smoke coffee when I could n't get a hold of cigarettes. I 'd roll coffee grounds into typing paper and smoke that and then vomit. # MJ : Oh, no! # TN : Oh, it 's so disgusting. I used to even dip and chew tobacco. # MJ : What was Pass Christian like? # TN : I only lived there until kindergarten, and then I used to go back and spend my summers and holidays with my grandmother and cousins and aunts and uncles. It 's right there on the Gulf Coast, and we would hang out on the water and go sailing or fishing or crabbing or floundering and build bonfires. Nothing but good memories. And then Hurricane Katrina came and wiped it out. That was devastating. # MJ : Were any family homes destroyed? # TN : Not fully. But my entire family rode out the storm there. It was a very scary time. There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to go back and it would be mass graves. Luckily, everyone survived. # MJ : In the past, you 've described your stepfather as a tough-love kind of guy. # TN : Yeah, he was a very stern, robotic, stoic person. He was an attorney and in the military and I was very all over the place, climbing trees and playing guitar. I was just an alien to him. I did n't have an interest in school at all and was getting in trouble all the time. # MJ : What for? # TN : I got caught smoking a bunch. And I was talking in class and playing pranks and skipping school. # MJ : Where did you get your deadpan sense of humor? # TN : My mother was just so funny ; I think she was a major influence. But I was always considered funny, even when I was little. Like little. Four years old. In kindergarten I was a funny kid. # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # TN : Yeah, I was popular, and I always got the feeling that teachers were amused by me even though I was trouble. I failed three grades and dropped out of high school. As soon as I say I 'm from Texas, people say, " Oh, I 'm sure the school was horrible, " and they picture me wearing some barrel and suspenders and people are bucktoothed and ignoring me. But that 's not the case. I just had zero interest. # MJ : Did living with this strict stepdad force you to grow up faster? # TN : Probably. I mean, I 'm now a pretty good mix of my mother and my stepfather. I 'm not hyper-emotional. My stepfather traveled a lot, and I kind of took on a role of parenting my mother a lot of times, because she was a bit of a pistol. She was an artist and a dancer and very wild and into fashion. # MJ : Was it hard for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were gay? # TN : You 'd think that, but no one ever really batted an eye. That realization did n't come to me until I was late teens, early 20s. I never ran into a single problem with any friend or family member. # MJ : You like to bring audiences to this point of discomfort. For instance, the bit where you push a stool around the stage, making a little scraping noise, until it 's almost pain-fill. What 's going through your head? # TN : I am very comfortable in those moments. I think if it bombed the whole time, that would even be the best comedy set I could possibly do. Just to be like, " You guys, you have to watch this footage. Nobody laughed. And here I am for five minutes pushing the stool around. " You know? That 's so amusing to me. Sometimes I 'll push the stool up and down the aisles of the venue and it will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ferociously between awkwardness and people laughing until they 're crying. # MJ : As a kid, did you ever imagine you 'd be a stand-up comic? # TN : I really wanted to, but I just did n't understand how people became comedians. I kind of thought it was something you were born into. It was n't something I pursued. # MJ : But then you started doing open mics. # TN : Yeah, right when I moved to LA -- and I never stopped until I got cancer. # MJ : You managed to work your personal hell into your routine, and into the Professor Blastoff series as well. # TN : Our listeners were so supportive that it just really blew my mind. Up until then I did n't really understand the power of the podcast. I knew people were listening, but I could n't just show up and be like, " Hey, so yeah, it 's crazy : # I got a new dishwasher this week, and, you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # MJ : And I guess that opening line at the Largo was too good to pass up. # TN : It 's just so jarring to go out waving to the audience, " Hello, I have cancer, how are you? How 's your night going? Just diagnosed with cancer, just diagnosed, how are you doing? " trying to make it sound like I 'm saying, " Are there any birthdays tonight? " but saying something really horrifying. That contradiction really amused me. I went back and forth about whether or not I should do it, and I 'm so glad I did. # MJ : What did people say about your diagnosis that you found helpful? # TN : It was helpful when people would say, " I ca n't imagine, " or " That sounds scary " -- just kind of exploring those moments with me. I struggled the most when somebody would be like, " You 're gon na be fine. " It was very isolating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Not that I needed somebody saying, " Oh yeah, you 're screwed. You 're gon na die. " But when you 're told that you have an invasive tumor, you do n't go, " Eh, you know what? Cancer, it 's come a long way! " # MJ : Do you now see yourself as the comic who grapples with dark material? # TN : Not at all. I am wanting to kind of clear the slate and start over. I 'm always going to do whatever I think is funniest. If something 's dark, I 'll do it. If it 's a sock puppet, if it 's a stool, I 'll do it. There 's no preconceived idea of who I think I might be now. # Letters to Newtown # Deluged by cards, letters, and drawings from a grieving nation following the Sandy Hook massacre, the town of Newtown, Connecticut, proposed to incinerate much of it and bury the ashes at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prop designer for Boardwalk Empire, who teamed up with Mother Jones to help preserve the messages for posterity.
