2032541 Say hello to a Design &; Engineering Award winner. // After the mass exodus of vehicles from our fleet a few months ago and the concurrent influx of replacements, things have settled down again. With this report we have only one new member to announce and one departure. Though the two cars are not related, they 're both from Stuttgart and each may well be the pinnacle of its particular market segment. They 're both awesome automobiles. Mercedes-Benz 5500 We were so taken with the 2000 Mercedes-Benz S-Class sedan that we bestowed a PopuLAR MECHANICS Design &; Engineering Award upon it. Hey, that was a no-brainer. As we noted in our D &E; report, " you could make a case for the S-Class being the best car ever made "( see " Design &; Engineering Awards 2000, " Dec. 1999, page 67). Time will tell if that case will be won or not, but we intend to find out the best way we know how. We ordered up an S-Class, one with the stronger 5.0-liter V8( as opposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black on black, because it 's an S-Class-you understand. The only option we specified was the multicontour front seats, which boast heaters, ventilating cooling fans, perforated leather for airflow, a myriad of adjustments and, for those long drives home after a grueling day, back massagers. Honest. Otherwise, all of the amazing en Photograph MERCEDES-BENZ S500 Test Summary : Mercedes-Benz S500 Report number : 1 Base price : $77,850 As-tested price : $81,385 Extra-cost options : Climate comfort multicontour front seats Drivetrain : 5.0-liter SOHC 24-valve V8 engine, five-speed automatic/manual transmission, rear-wheel drive Engine performance : 302 hp/347 ft. -lb.

That includes the single-module controller for the navigation system, heater and a/c system and audio system, the rain-sensing self-adjusting intermittent wipers, auto-dimming rear- and sideview mirrors, the flexible service system and trip computer, ESP stability control, which includes ASR traction control, ABS, which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, double-glazed side windows, an adjustable suspension and airbags just about everywhere. Last, but not least, the S500 carries the burden of being the flagship sedan for one of the most proud and prestigious automakers in the world. Mercedes-Benz is, as the folks there will gladly remind you, the world 's first carmaker. That 's a lot of baggage for this sedan to carry, but it 's wellequipped to manage the load. We look forward to reporting to you on how well it succeeds. -Don Chaikin Toyota Avalon XLS It 's hard to complain about a $30,000 car that has an interior that 's quieter at 65 mph than some $65,000 cars have at 30 mph. This is one affordable luxury sedan. The touches of chrome on the grille give it an elegant look. The soft leather and plush carpeting lull you into believing that you 're in a much more expensive sedan. Certainly a sedan with more status. This is n't a Lexus. It 's a Toyota. But it 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely well-done car with a lot of nice touches. And since it is a Toyota, those touches are all well done, too. The CD player that 's in the dash is n't just a player, it 's a six-disc changer. That sort of thing. But if we have one concern with the Avalon, it 's that since it is a Toyota, everything is also very conservative. The styling, though approaching elegance, lacks any flair that befits a flagship. The interior, though so comfortable and so well appointed, lacks any styling or ergonomic touches that let you know you 're in a 2000 model year car. It 's as though the engineers at Toyota decided that the ideal Avalon buyer was someone who normally would buy a Buick. As a result, everything is a little soft, a little conservative and extremely inoffensive. With one service and well past 5000 miles under its belt, it is squeakfree, rattlefree and there 's not a bolt, weld, stitch or hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interstates-even the winter-ravaged ones around Detroit are no problem-and it soaks up the road silently and effortlessly. There 's plenty of power for merging and passing and the handling is sure-footed, even along twisty roadways. The drive from PM 's home office in New York to our Detroit office was almost an exercise in smooth, silent anonymity. And given those attributes, the Avalon is proving perfect for the kind of photographic espionage that a Detroit spy needs. Jim Dunne Lincoln LS Drive a Lincoln LS and, despite Lincoln 's snappy ad campaign that declares it " American luxury, " you might think you 're driving a more expensive luxury European sedan. Well, you are. One of the least publicized secrets out of Ford Motor Co. -which owns both Lincoln and Jaguar( as well as Volvo, Land Rover and much of Mazda) -is that the Lincoln LS and the Jaguar S-Type are practically the same car beneath different bodies and interiors. With its taut suspension, tight feel and controlled, smooth ride, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. It 's a nimble handler that makes you feel like a good driver. In fact, it 's a lot of fun to drive. And when was the last time we could say that about any Lincoln?

A rather good deal, do n't you know? The Lincoln LS is classified by the auto industry as an entry-luxury car. It competes with the Lexus ES 300, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Cadillac Catera, Infiniti 130 and BMW 3 Series. But what sets the Lincoln apart from these others is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V6 is standard). Our test car has it and it makes all the difference. Rated 252 hp and 267 ft. -lb. of torque, the 3.9-liter V8 lets the Lincoln blow away its competition on off ramps and at stoplights. It also makes passing at highway speeds safe and sure. Our test car is fitted with the optional sport package, which adds bigger wheels and tires, more taut suspension settings and a lot more adrenaline to a garden-variety LS. Outfit one along these lines and you 'll be looking for BMWs on those off ramps. With no fear. Driving the Lincoln LS is as much a pleasure as it is fun. All the luxury amenities are there as standard equipment including the prerequisite leather seating areas. We 've been thoroughly enjoying the time in our tester, and it 's already suffered through a winter and spring of tough commuting duty into New York City with a couple of longer trips thrown in. We 're up against the car 's next recommended service interval, so our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &R; soon. Lincoln paid for the oil and filter for the first service, we 'll keep you posted on what happens with the second. Joe Oldham Porsche 911 Carrera After the long but strange winter weather had finally broken, our 911 Carrera made it back to our East Coast offices from Tinseltown, or if you 'd rather, Los Angeles. Back East is where it spent the last few months of its tenure with us. It 's with considerable regret that we return the Camera to Porsche. Maybe it 's just as well-we enjoyed driving it so much we sometimes neglected driving some other vehicles we should have been evaluating. Rarely are we given the opportunity to drive a car with this level of performance and handling. Not to mention the excellent fuel economy, which is good enough to compensate for a couple of full-size SUVs. Yes, good sedans can be fun. But no sedan approaches the level of fun you can have driving a Porsche. Indeed, few cars of any variety can rival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left seat, we have accumulated some complaints, albeit small ones. For one, the HVAC system will demist the windshield within seconds. But it does n't stay clear for long if it 's raining out and you set the system to a less noisy alternative. So rainy days require toggling the demist system on and off in a 10-second/10-minute alternation. For another, Porsche used to install a rubber bib to go under the gas filler cap, but the current crop of Porsche Carreras do n't have one. And after a year of fill-ups on both coasts, lots of places in between and at hours that more normal people would n't be anywhere near a gas station, the fender around the fuel fill is scratched. Which is a pity, because that fuel filler is high atop the right front fender.

Our car leaked oil-enough oil to precipitate a trip to the dealer for a new rear main seal. Now those of you familiar with Porsches know that 's not a simple task- it starts by removing the engine from the car-but one that should have taken only a single day of downtime. But once out, the engine seemed to have developed a number of leaks, necessitating a tear-down of one cylinder bank 's camshaft box and an extensive list of replacement seals and gaskets. The dealer in Santa Barbara, Steve Taub, had to order the parts and, though all the repairs were covered under warranty, we were a couple of long weeks and untold miles without our beloved Porsche. -Mike Allen Subaru Legacy Outback Limited Our Outback wagon has drawn the toughest duty in our fleet : full-time full-family hauler. On Saturday morning, fold the rear seatbacks down and make endless runs to garden centers to gather up each one 's finest specimens. Keep those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week 's worth of necessities, all in bulk. And as long as the rear seats are down, empty the cargo and take the dogs to the county dog park for a romp. Come Sunday night the interior of the Outback looks like a room in the old fiat house after a long weekend of serious, er, studying. No problem. Slip out the big rubber cargo mat and hose off all the potting soil, crumbs and loose hair. Then put those seatbacks up and everyone fits inside for the drive to dinner. And Monday morning, slide the cargo cover over the hold to hide the computer case, slip some Dick Dale into the CD player and it 's back to the commute. Our Outback does it all without a single complaint. We, however, do have a couple. First, and we might as well get this out of the way now, 165 hp just does n't cut it. The Outback with its awd drivetrain components and assorted accouterment simply weighs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sluggish. And since we find ourselves dipping deeper into the gas pedal to make it go better, the fuel economy suffers as well. Subaru seems to agree, since they 've recently announced an optional 212-hp six-cylinder engine for the car. Our other concerns are less critical, but these are annoying problems nonetheless : There 's just not quite enough legroom for our long-legged 6-ft. -plus drivers to be comfortable during the long haul. And though seat heaters are always appreciated on a cold morning, the Outback 's 5 take an awfully long time to actually build up warmth, and the posie tion of their rocker switches, on the front face of the rear of the center console, gets them switched on and off willy-hilly. However, no one has any complaints about the light and fresh air available through the two sliding glass sunroofs. -D. C.
