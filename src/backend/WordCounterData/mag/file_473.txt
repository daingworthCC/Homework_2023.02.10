4083541 SHOPPING FOR a new cell phone can be overwhelming ; after all, these devices do a lot more than just make calls. They also come in a variety of shapes, sizes, operating systems, and interfaces. So which carrier has the best selection? It really depends on what you 're looking for. If you 're shopping for an Android phone, Verizon and T-Mobile offer the best array of choices. In fact, the number one phone on our Top 10 Cell Phones chart( find.pcworld. com/63492), the HTC Droid Incredible, is on the Verizon network, as is the thirdranked Motorola Droid. The second-place phone listed on the same chart, the Google Nexus One, is on T-Mobile. AT &T; currently has only one Android phone, but the company is also the exclusive carrier of the popular iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS. In addition, AT &T; sells two versions of the BlackBerry Bold, which is by far the best BlackBerry design now available. Sprint 's phone offerings are n't as impressive as those of the other carriers - for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the network this summer, Sprint could very well have a dream team of powerful 4G-capable smartphones in the works. HTC Droid Incredible Lives Up to Its Name The Droid Incredible( $200 with a two-year contract) is the latest, hottest Android handset to hit the market. The best of the Droids on Verizon, this phone impresses with its speed, its brilliant AMOLED display, and its fun Sense user interface. Design-wise, the Droid Incredible seems fairly similar to the Nexus One, but in essence it 's a CDMA version of the HTC Desire, which launched in February at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain. It has an 8-megapixel camera, versus the Nexus One and Desire 's 5-megapixel shooters. It also has a strange, rubberized, " topographic " battery cover, which I could have done without. The Incredible is lighter than the Nexus One, but it also feels less solid. In contrast to the Nexus One 's four touch keys, the Droid Incredible has four physical keys( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom. I prefer the Nexus One 's touch keys, though, as they give that phone a more streamlined look. Another difference is that the Droid Incredible has an optical mouse as opposed to a trackball. As RIM has done with its BlackBerry handsets, HTC seems to be shifting away from trackballs( the HTC Desire and Legend both have an optical mouse). The Droid Incredible runs Android 2.1 with the revised Sense interface. My favorite new Sense feature is Leap, an elegant approach to multitasking( reminiscent of Palm 's WebOS deck-of-cards visualization). Pinch anywhere on the homescreen, and you jump to seven thumbnails of your open pages. You can then go to any of those open apps or close out of one. Thanks to the Droid Incredible 's speedy IGHz Snapdragon processor, this feature works extremely well, too. Friend Stream, HTCs social network aggregator, lets you view your friends ' status updates, shared links. and pictures al) in one seamless view. Supported networks include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard Android apps, such as Gmail, Google Talk, and YouTube, you get HTCs Twitter app( Peep) and its photo geotagging app( Footprints). You also have easy access to Verizon 's apps via the Android Market 's Verizon channel. While 5-megapixel cameras seem to be the standard for high-end smartphones right now, you can expect to see a lot more 8-megapixel camera phones in the near feature. Overall, I liked the Droid Incredible 's camera. You press the haptic mouse to snap pictures ; though the method works okay, I would have preferred a dedicated camera key. As I held it, the phone did n't feel especially steady, and sometimes my pictures looked a bit blurry. Otherwise, I was pleased with my outdoor shots. Colors were bright and natural, and details looked sharp. The camera also had little shutter lag. My indoor shots looked good, too, though a few had a slight yellow tint. The flash seemed a bit unpredictable as to when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shots were pretty well lit already, so when the flash went off, the details and colors were blown out. Nighttime snapshots looked good - better, in fact, than such pictures from most flash-equipped smartphone cameras. The Droid Incredible can shoot high-resolution video up to 800 by 480, but it ca n't take 720p video. Though it 's fine for quick clips, I was disappointed by the slight pixelation in my videos. I wish that HTC had updated the Sense media player. It 's prettier than the dull-asdirt Android player, but I prefer iTunes or Palm 's WebOS player. Still, audio sounded good, and the player supports a respectable range of audio and video formats. Video played back over YouTube looked good. When I downloaded a few movie trailers, I was impressed by the smooth playback, sharp details, and clean colors. The Droid Incredible also supports Flash Lite, but I had difficulty playing Flash content.( I also encountered this problem with the HTC Hero on Sprint. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone available - it certainly is the best on Verizon. But how will this model compare to the upcoming iPhone 4G, with its rumored frontfacing camera and higherresolution display? Smartphone shoppers will have some enticing choices this summer, that 's for sure. - Ginny Mies
