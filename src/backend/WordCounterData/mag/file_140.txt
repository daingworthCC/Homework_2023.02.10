2017541 American Craft Council Honorary Fellow Margery Anneberg( 1921-2003) died May 19 in Hayward, CA, from complications of multiple sclerosis. When she opened the Anneberg Gallery, in 1966 in San Francisco, it was one of the first in the area to show art in craft media-among the " local " artists she exhibited were Dominic Di Mare, Marvin Lipofsky, Ed Rossbach, Katherine Westphal, Kay Sekimachi, Trude Guermonprez and June Schwarcz. She also displayed folk art from around the world to demonstrate its significant kinship with craft art. But seeing a need for more education behind these exhibitions, she founded the nonprofit Center for Folk Art and Contemporary Craft in 1972, head-quartered in her gallery, and published a newsletter. By the time she closed the gallery, in 1981, partly for reasons of health, Anneberg had become involved in the founding, with Gertrud Parker, of the San Francisco Museum of Craft &; Folk Art, which opened in 1983, and which she served as curator until retiring in 1986. Born in Carroll, IA, Anneberg was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Washington, Seattle, earning a degree in social science. She returned there after World War II to pursue a doctorate in Asian studies, including Chinese language and literature. But her developing interest in making jewelry( ignited by classes taken in New York City during the war) eventually superseded her academic pursuits. After moving to San Francisco, in 1957, Anneberg continued to make jewelry while employed in various capacities in the library at the University of California, Berkeley, where today an interview with her is part of the California Craft Artist Oral History Series. In 1964 she opened The Jewelry Shop, which two years later became the Anneberg Gallery. In tribute to her longtime friend and supporter, enamelist June Schwarcz says : " Margery Anneberg gave those of us who are craftsmen an audience. She helped give the work the prestige it deserved. To those who love the ethnic arts, she brought delight, stimulation, information and the spirits of other cultures into our lives. " Blacksmith C. Cart Jennings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built in Sonoma, CA. Athird-generation blacksmith, he was born in Marion, IL, and began working in metal in 1928, alongside his father, before attending the California College of Arts and Crafts, Oakland( B.F.A., 1934). He was employed in several blacksmith shops in the San Francisco Bay Area before opening his own, El Diablo Forge, in Lafayette, CA, in 1947, where he created architectural wrought metal for such clients as the Christian Brothers Winery, St. Helena, and the Chapel of the Chimes, Oakland. In 1969, he and his wife, Elizabeth, moved to Sonoma and spent the next five years living in a trailer while they built their unique circular house of hand-laid stone and forged steel, with huge round windows incorporating glass bottles from a local vineyard( featured m American Craft February/March 2001). " From cabinet pulls to window mullions, from front door to Carl 's ingenious versions of a commode, the relationships of metal to wood to ceramic, glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " James Wallace, director of the National Ornamental Metal Museum, Memphis, TN, has said of the house. " Carl leaves us the lesson of what it means to be an artist-craftsman. " Jennings received the Award of Merit from the Sonoma League for Historic Preservation in 1980 and the Alex Bealer Award from the Artist-Blacksmith 's Association of North America, in 1988, the same year he was named a Fellow of the American Craft Council. Eight forged steel vessels Jennings left to the National Ornamental Metal Museum are on view there through September 21. Bob Winston( 1915-2003), a pioneer in the studio jewelry movement known for his intricately textured works employing lost-wax casting, died April 6 in Pleasant Hill, CA. Early in his career, Winston developed his own tools by modifying dental instruments, which allowed him to capture the delicacy of the small organic objects he often cast. " Seek and ye shall find in Nature that which would inspire a solution to the most perplexing of designs, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatise on the process. Born in Long Beach, CA, Winston studied art and art history at the University of California, Berkeley( B.F.A., 1942, M.A., 1944). A professor at the California College of Arts and Crafts, Oakland, from 1942 to 1958, he later taught extension courses at the University of Arizona, Phoenix, and workshops at his Pleasant Hill studio. His numerous contributions to the field include the invention of a gold and silver jewelry oxidizer, Win-Ox, in the 1940s, to which he added oxidizers for bronze, nickel and copper in the late 19903. He was a founder, in 1951, of the San Francisco Metal Arts Guild, with fellow artists Merry Renk, Irena Brynnerand Florence Resnikoff, among others. In 1997, he was elected a Fellow of the American Craft Council. Ceramist Anne Kraus( 1956-2003), whose painted vessels incorporate images and text from her dreams, died May 23 in Louisville, CO, of cancer. Born in Short Hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Philadelphia( B.A. painting 1978), she was drawn to ceramics in 1980, after viewing the Metropolitan Museum of Art 's collection of court porcelains. " I was bothered that such beautiful objects could be so void of emotional depth, " she said of the experience, which led her to enroll at the New York State College of Ceramics, Alfred University( B.F.A. 1984). Kraus went on to exhibit her work in numerous group and solo shows, and she is represented in several museum collections, including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, CA, the Newark Museum, NJ, and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. " One thing that distinguishes ceramics for me-and which never happened with painting-is that I tumbled head over heels into it, " she was quoted as saying in an essay by Garth Clark in the catalog for her 1998 survey at his New York City gallery. " It was like being swept up in a huge wave. My feeling for ceramic history, for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that I find so beautiful and I just want to make my version of it. It is a gift, a payment, that I make to the tradition. " <p>
