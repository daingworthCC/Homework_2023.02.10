5011941 <p> California 's voter registration card is undergoing an extensive makeover as part of a statewide effort to reduce confusion over party affiliation, state officials said. <p> The changes were prompted by a Los Angeles Times report that revealed a number of Californians had mistakenly registered for the American Independent Party, instead of their intended " no party preference. " <p> The American Independent Party was founded in 1967 to support the presidential candidacy of former Alabama Gov. George Wallace -- an avowed segregationist. <p> According to the Times report, the confusion prevented some voters from casting a ballot in California 's 2016 presidential primaries. <p> But the issue " has been lingering for years, " and " a combination of issues prompted us to see is there was a better way, " California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said. <p> California 's new voter registration cards will provide the option to check " No Party/None " for those who wish to not register with a political party.( Associated Press) <p> The new registration cards are intended to be easier to read and understand, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed on voter registration cards in a larger font and voters will also will have the option to select " No Party/None. " <p> " I think that it will result in more completed forms coming in, and should reduce the confusion, " said Dean Logan, registrar of voters for Los Angeles County. " This positions us to be in a better place in 2020. " <p> Markham Robinson, chairman of the American Independent Party 's executive committee, however, expressed skepticism over the purported confusion and described a voter 's political party as an " incidental aspect of registration. " <p> Officials say the new voter registration cards will be distributed within the week. <p> Bradford Betz is an editor for Fox News. Follow him on Twitter @bradfordbetz.
