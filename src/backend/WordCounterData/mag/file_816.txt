4183341 <h> HomeAway co-founder Brian Sharples takes the helm of Twyla( for now) <h> 0 <p> Twyla, a nearly three-year-old, venture-backed startup that collaborates with artists to create exclusive prints for sale at its site, has a new CEO. <p> In June, Brian Sharples -- who founded the 10-year-old, vacation rental marketplace HomeAway, acquired in 2015 for a whopping $3.9 billion by Expedia -- quietly took the helm of the young company, after one of his co-founders in Twyla, former CEO Matt Randall, stepped away from the role. <p> According to media reports in Austin, Tex., where Twyla is based, Randall was sued last year by the co-founders of the Pop Austin International Art Show, who alleged that Randall, another co-founder of the art show, had diverted money from the young arts organization to fund Twyla. The co-founders, Steve and Lana Carlson, did n't respond to our requests for more information this week, but Randall tells us the lawsuit " has been settled, and sadly, I am not at liberty to comment about it. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor to serve as CEO of Twyla " and he is " really proud of what we as a team accomplished during my tenure, " he has now " moved on to start a new company which I am very excited about. " <p> Twyla, which sells art at prices that range from $1,000 to $5,000, had raised $14 million in funding last fall led by GV, with participation from earlier investors IVP and Redpoint Ventures. The company has so far raised $19 million altogether. <p> GV, IVP and Redpoint declined to comment for this story. A spokesperson for Twyla, for which Sharples previously served as chairman, tells us via email : " The lawsuit against Matt Randall by his former business partners, which was documented in select media outlets back in October, has been settled. He 's now pursuing new opportunities and I hope you understand that we ca n't comment further on the matter. Brian Sharples, a founder of Twyla and chairman of the board, took over as acting CEO several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter-to-quarter growth since the launch of the company, we 're actively pursuing a new CEO to the take the company to the next level. " <p> Sharples had left his position as CEO of HomeAway -- one of Austin 's most iconic tech companies -- in September of last year.
