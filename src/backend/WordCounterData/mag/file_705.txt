4153241 TABLE # TABLE # TABLE # TABLE # " Well, what about Montana? " Julian 's voice came from the other end of the line. Perfect. The Treasure State. This was just the place for Parker Cook, Ben Wheeler, Julian Carr, and me to meet back up with still photographer Chris Bezamat and filmmaker John Roderick for a Team Discrete reunion tour. We 'll be a bunch of ski pirates searching for gold in the mountainous seas of Montana, I thought as I hung up the phone. # We hit the road with the vague framework of a plan and the energy dial maxed. Our sights were set on what the team likes to call " Rowdesia " -- the metaphysical place one inevitably ends up when things get rowdy. # Montana would n't even flinch. It 's just that kind of place. # Team Discrete 's first stop was Discovery Basin, outside of Anaconda, Montana, for the Billy Poole Memorial Fund 's Ski with the Pros weekend -- an annual event that remembers late pro skier Billy Poole, a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love of the sport to the next generation. # Maybe it was because Billy used to ski at Disco back in the day. Or maybe it was because the local kids seemed unconcerned with their ill-fitting, hand-me-down gear or their pizza-pie straightline technique. But this year 's event was extra special. We spent the day herding tiny goggle-less boppers around the mountain while they demonstrated the unimportance of turning and the surprising forgiveness tree-wells offer as landing zones. Remember the first time you landed a daffy? Or skied a double black diamond? We lived that feeling right alongside the kids. The delight in their faces touched all of us so-called pros perhaps more than we could ever affect them. # TABLE # Over shot skis, dancing, and the Billy Poole Memorial Frozen Turkey Toss at the nearby Brown Derby restaurant and bar later that evening, we realized that our welcome-to-Montana moment had been a reminder of exactly what skiing is all about in the first place : fearless and uninhibited fun. # We hoisted sails and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were rough, but locals seemed unfazed. Up high on Schlasman 's lift, rime ice grew sideways off chairs, towers, trees, and rocks in the wind and frigid temps. After a short bootpack, we dropped below the milk and discovered sensational steeps. Eight inches of fresh coated a lifetime 's worth of colorful little couloirs and picturesque, greasable lines. With cameras rolling, Ben, Parker, Julian, and I took turns blasting through frosty glades and down craggy chutes. # After a long day on the hill, we headed into Bozeman for total detonation. A cloud of smoke and a whiff of Rowdesia trailed us through town. I do n't believe one bar escaped our pillaging. The night ended in our hotel room, where we surfed the ironing board on mattress waves. The swell lasted until it was time to throw on ski boots. # This was our program for the three days and nights we spent in Bozeman and at Bridger Bowl. Southwest Montana was our kind of place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild and sparsely populated Hi-Line, just south of the Canadian border. # " It 's going to be worth the drive, " said Julian. All we could do was trust him. # TABLE # Julian had previously given a talk at the University of Montana, where he met a student named Anthony Krolczyk. Anthony was headed to a remote cabin in the Lewis and Clark National Forest outside of Choteau to do some backcountry skiing and invited Team Discrete to join. # We met Anthony at the rendezvous point late, and by 9 p.m. we were gunning it through snow trenches up Teton Pass in total darkness. Suddenly our caravan stopped in front of two sleds, a tow-behind toboggan, and two shadowy figures, Anthony 's uncle Tim and friend Luke Styren, ready to take us off-road to destination unknown. # TABLE # TABLE # TABLE # TABLE # After more than an hour struggling up the trail with a MacGyvered towing system for nine people plus gear, everyone arrived at the cabin. Inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered the soot-stained walls. Warmed by a crackling fire, every square inch of the cabin showed generations of use by the Styren family. # TABLE # TABLE # TABLE # We fried up bacon-wrapped pork chops and freshly cut veggies in a cast-iron skillet. Our mouths watered as the smell of sizzling fat mingled with the smokiness from the fire. At 1 a.m., after beers, bacon, and laughs, we snuggled into sleeping bags. # With the sunrise, we saw the otherworld to which we had been led. The cabin rested unscathed in a valley scorched by an enormous forest fire, alonely island in a wondrous postapocalyptic topography of limitless ski possibilities. # Anthony, Luke, and Tim towed us in along the burn zone to the abandoned Teton Pass Ski Area, closed allegedly due to an insurance problem. Sunshine poured through a forest of perfectly straight, blackened trees. We toured around the shuttered lodges and lapped deserted trails stacked with boot-top pow. # How many times have you said, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That day, we did. Rallying around the surreal and empty area, we threw up cheesy claims, noodled through burned glades, and high-fived all morning. Later, we shuttled back to the cabin, settled in, drank a lot of whiskey, and shot a few hundred rounds at empty propane tanks with Styren 's arsenal. # Two thousand miles later, crossing back into Idaho at journey 's end, we realized we had only glimpsed the Treasure State 's beautiful roughness -- but what a glimpse it was. And we had successfully avoided overplanning. That vague framework was all we needed to strike gold. # LAST FEBRUARY, WE SENT JULIAN CARR* AND A MERRY BAND CALLED TEAM DISCRETE ON A ROAD TRIP THROUGH THE VAST AND WILD STATE OF MONTANA AS THE PRIZE FOR WINNING A SKIING-SPONSORED COMPETITION.? WE DID N'T REALIZE THEY 'D GO NATIVE. # * The cliff-hucking, neck-beard-growing, owner of Discrete Headwear. # &amp;degger ; Shown here, left to right : Rachael Burks, Ben Wheeler, Parker Cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roderick and photographer Chris Bezamat. #?
