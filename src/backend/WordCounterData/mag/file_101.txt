2012441 She 's the mistress of bling at Dior Fine Jewelry, and her lofty apartment-hidden away in the center of Paris-is just as unconventionally chic // Even at 9 A.M., Victoire de Castellane is full of surprises. " Living here is like being in the 1950s, and I love that, " says the playful Dior Fine Jewelry artistic director about her apartment in Paris ' 16th Arrondissement, where she moved three years ago. " It seems so far from the world. " It 's unexpected because, though she lives in serenity, de Castellane is better known for her whimsical ways. She 's dressed, as usual, in a bosom-spilling frock( today it 's a ' ' 50s-style printed Prada number), shod in voluptuously high Louis Vuitton heels and sporting chunky cocktail rings in an array of berry shades ; she also has a beaded Hello Kitty bag close by.

But there 's more to this nostalgic retreat than meets the eye : If the tiny, quirky rubber figurines of Japanese anime superheroes beside an ample minimalist cream sofa merely suggest fairy-tale-like proportions, then de Castellane 's vast closet, arranged in a rainbow of colors, is her playground. " I have to be able to see everything, " she explains. " I loathe a closet stuffed to the brim. Clothes are fun, but they should not invade your personality. " Since launching Dior 's fine-jewelry line in 1999, she has certainly brought back the " big personality " ring, just as she jazzed up the costume jewelry at Chanel from 1984 to 1997.
