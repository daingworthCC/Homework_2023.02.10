4151341 Section : Fitness ROLL AWAY PAIN # Foam rolling, that frankly awesome stand-in for massage, deserves even more credit. New research supports what trainers and physical therapists have claimed for years : Done just before exercise, the simple technique can reduce muscle fatigue and soreness dramatically enough that the workout feels easier. And rolling as part of your cooldown has been shown to cut down on post-exercise discomfort. It eases aches by improving blood flow and restoring muscular and joint function, explains manual therapist Sue Hitzmann, creator of the Melt Method. The one hitch : Many people press too hard on the roller, which can be painful. To get the benefits without the ouch, aim for consistent, light pressure, and consider using a softer roller, like the Melt Soft Body Roller( $59.99 ; meltmethod.com). Then, try these pre-fixes before going on your next walk or run. # 1. NO-PAIN QUADS Place roller under upper thighs, legs relaxed and straight. Slowly drag legs together and apart( like in jumping jacks) 5 times. Repeat with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees. # 2. ACHE-FREE BACK # Start on back with roller under middle of pelvis, knees bent and feet flat on floor. Keeping legs together, raise knees over hips. Slowly rock knees side to side 3 times, massaging lower back. # 3. LOOSE SHOULDERS # Place roller under upper back, hands behind head. Slowly curl ribs forward to move roller down back to bottom of ribs, then quickly return roller to upper back in a gliding motion. Repeat 4 times. #1 Move for Tank-Top Arms # The triangle push-up challenges triceps more than a regular push-up. The only difference is the hand position : Place your palms on the floor directly under your chest, creating a triangle with your index fingers and thumbs. #
