4175141 <h> More than a dozen Iowa children on a botanical garden visit ended up at a Fiorina anti-abortion forum. <p> Carly Fiorina 's presidential campaign is brushing off accusations that the candidate hijacked a school trip to an Iowa botanical garden and turned it into an anti-abortion rally -- including a large picture of a fetus in the background. <p> As Fiorina entered a " right to life " forum at the Greater Des Moines botanical garden on Wednesday before about 60 people, she reportedly steered more than a dozen preschoolers to sit around her on a small stage, then discussed her opposition to abortion. <p> The father of one four-year-old in the group complained the candidate had " ambushed " the field trip. " The kids went there to see the plants, " Chris Beck, of Ankeny, Iowa, and the father of Chatham Beck, told the Guardian. <p> " Taking them into a pro-life/abortion discussion... very poor taste and judgment, " Beck said of the former Hewlett-Packard CEO. " I would not want my four-year-old going to that forum -- he ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mutant Ninja Turtles and Transformers. " <p> The Fiorina campaign said the incident was n't that nefarious. <p> " In Des Moines yesterday, a group of preschoolers along with their parents and teachers followed Carly right into the event she was speaking at for Iowa Right to Life, " campaign manager Sarah Isgur Flores said in a statement. " Earlier, she 'd run into the kids in the Botanical Gardens and watched the Koi with them for a while. I guess the kids must have thought she was pretty neat because then their teachers and parents and the kids all followed Carly into the event complete with Carly stickers. " <p> Fiorina is languishing in the low single-digits in polls in Iowa and nationally, with less than two weeks to go before voters caucus in the Hawkeye state. <p> With a renewed focus on abortion, Fiorina is harkening back to her best weeks of the campaign : In late September and early October, her numbers spiked after a passionate -- if factually challenged -- statement on " sting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving fetus after an abortion. <p> " I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama to watch these tapes, " she said at the Sept. 16 Republican primary debate. " Watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain. " <p> According to FactCheck.org, the video to which she was referring was spliced together from several sources, and it 's unclear if the video depicts what it describes.
