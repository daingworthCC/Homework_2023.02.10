2015041 Dear Dr. Cory : I like to play sports.When I am done, my heels hurt so much that I can hardly walk. My mom said it is from running on hard ground. I put pads in the bottom of my shoes, but that does not help. When I bump my heels, they hurt. Why is this happening? Toby Boeckman St Henry, Ohio Dear Toby : Heel pain is frequently due to plantar fascitis( PLAN-ter fas-SY-tus). This is inflammation of the tissue that wraps around the heel and runs to the ball of the foot. It is often caused by not wearing shoes with adequate cushioning, being overweight, or standing for long periods of time. Research has found that one of the best ways to take care of such heel pain is to wear the rubber heel cups found at most athletic shoe stores. Heel cups provide the most pain relief when used along with exercises that stretch the foot arch and heel cord. If you play outdoor soccer, shoes with cleats do n't provide much cushioning against the hard ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of soccer shoe called a " turf " shoe. It provides more cushioning. If you have constant pain or swelling, you should check with your doctor. These could be signs of a sprain or fracture. When you have heel pain, put ice on the heel for ten to twenty minutes. Sometimes relief of pain comes only with rest, so you might have to cut back on your activities for a while. To Help Prevent Heel Pain : 1. Face a wall and place your hands against the wall at shoulder height. 2. Step forward with one foot, bending that knee. 3. Extend the other leg behind you, toes pointing straight ahead. 4. As you lean forward, you 'll feel the stretch in the heel cord and foot arch of the extended leg. Hold the stretch for fifteen seconds. 5. Relax and repeat several times. 6. Repeat the stretches with the other leg extended. Dear Dr. Cory : I am wondering what the bellybutton is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truitt Wichita, Kansas Dear Jonelle : Your belly-button, or umbilicus, is the place where your umbilical cord was attached. Before a baby is born, it grows inside its mother 's uterus. The uterus is a muscle that gets bigger as the baby gets bigger. It provides a safe, warm place for the baby to grow. While a baby is growing inside the uterus, it is connected to the mother 's placenta by the umbilical cord. Through this cord, the baby receives all the food and oxygen it needs from the mother. Waste chemicals from the baby, such as carbon dioxide, pass back the other way through the cord. When the baby is born, it no longer needs the umbilical cord. It gets its food by nursing from the mother or drinking from a bottle. And the baby gets the oxygen it needs from the air. So, after birth, the baby 's cord is clamped and cut. It does n't hurt because the cord does n't have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and falls off, leaving just the belly button. Dear Dr. Cory : How do coughs form? Jamie Snapp Farmington, New Mexico I cough all the time. How are coughs formed? Virginia Ortiz San Diego, California Dear Jamie and Virginia : Coughing is a protective action that clears your throat and other air passages of irritating particles. Such things as dust, food, and even your own mucus can make you cough until your throat is clear. When you cough, you first take a deep breath. Then your vocal cords close, closing your windpipe. The muscles that help you breathe air out, your expiratory muscles, tighten. Suddenly your vocal cords open, shooting out the trapped air along with whatever was irritating your airway. Constant or long-lasting coughs can be due to such things as a viral or bacterial infections, asthma, allergies, something caught in the windpipe or lungs, or irritating fumes from paint or tobacco smoke.
