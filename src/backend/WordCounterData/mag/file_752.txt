4176941 <h> Dueling Tactical Previews : The Manchester United View of the Liverpool Clash <p> Matt Dunham/Associated PressKlopp and Mourinho meet again on Monday night. <p> 3.4K <p> Reads <p> 5 <p> Comments <p> Bleacher Report 's Liverpool correspondent, Jack Lusby, was kind enough to provide an outline of how he expects Jurgen Klopp 's Reds to line up when they take on Jose Mourinho 's Manchester United on Monday. <p> Let 's read what he has to say, then set out a plan for Mourinho to earn United their third Premier League win on the trot at Anfield. <p> " Jurgen Klopp implemented a surprise tactical shift over the summer, moving from his tried-and-trusted 4-2-3-1 into a new-look 4-3-3 shape, and that has continued into the 2016/17 campaign, " Lusby said. " The German has set his side up in this system in every game so far, and having taken 16 points from a possible 21 so far in the Premier League, it 's clearly paying off. " <p> He continued : " The formation is largely fluid, with Klopp recently insisting that ' everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attacking from the back. In this sense, one player in his defensive line, James Milner, has become key. The vice-captain is likely to line up at left-back once again on Monday night alongside Nathaniel Clyne, Joel Matip and, if fit, Dejan Lovren, shielding Loris Karius in goal. <p> " In this unit, Milner and Matip are most front-footed options, pushing forward whenever possible, while Lovren and Clyne are more reserved. Having conceded 10 goals already this season, however, there are clear teething issues to be worked out -- and in Karius ' first-season hesitance, this can be United 's target. <p> " The same setup can be seen in midfield, with Klopp 's regular unit of Jordan Henderson( primarily the deepest-lying of the three), Georginio Wijnaldum( primarily a link between defence and attack) and Adam Lallana( primarily an attacking midfielder) switching duties when required -- but injuries to both Wijnaldum and Lallana could see the German shuffle his pack. <p> " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucas Leiva or Kevin Stewart come in, and it seems most likely that if both Wijnaldum and Lallana are unavailable, it would be Can and Lucas, with Henderson adopting Lallana 's role. Alternatively, Klopp could move back to the 4-2-3-1. <p> Pepijn Lijnders on James Milner at left-back : " The best players in the team need to see the most of the ball. " https : //t.co/fWOaiePhSt <p> " The support of Milner, Can and Henderson retains the extra edge that Liverpool 's forward three have thrived on so far this season, and despite all three travelling considerable distances during the international break, Sadio Mane, Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino are all likely to start. <p> " Mane lends a pacy, direct threat on the right, Coutinho is a creative influence drifting inside from the left and Firmino is a complete all-rounder in the No. 9 role -- he presses relentlessly, links up play incisively, opens up space intelligently and can finish off attacking moves in predatory fashion. <p> " Firmino is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat to United on Monday night, but Milner and Mane are also ones for Mourinho to look out for. " <p> There is a lot to digest here. Liverpool 's recent form has, as Lusby said, been excellent, and what Klopp has had his side doing has, for the most part, worked well. But it has not been perfect -- the Reds ' win over Swansea City was harder than it should probably have been, for example. <p> Lusby mentioned " Karius ' first-season hesitance " as a potentially exploitable weakness. Against Manchester City in September, in spite of City 's eventual success in that game, United had plenty of joy targeting the shaky Claudio Bravo on the goalkeeper 's Premier League debut. <p> Zlatan Ibrahimovic was key to this, scoring with a wonderful finish from a goalkeeping error and then failing to put away a chance Jesse Lingard earned with ferocious pressing of the nervous-looking ' keeper. In order to create these opportunities, Mourinho had clearly instructed his team to press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but being backed up against Pogba and Ibrahimovic leaping behind you, is another completely. https : //t.co/Z5BQyuwLJN <p> When the stopper had the ball at his feet in the second half, Paul Pogba, Wayne Rooney, Marcus Rashford and Ibrahimovic were tasked with marking players who could serve as out-balls. This intense pressing, combined with putting balls into the box for Ibrahimovic to use his powerful physical presence could yield rewards. <p> And talking of intense pressing, whatever lineup Liverpool do play, in whatever formation, Mourinho can be sure Klopp 's men will attack from the front. United 's centre-backs will have to be on their game with the ball at their feet. <p> This gives the manager something of a dilemma at centre-half. If United are going to have a lot of the ball, it would be ideal for Daley Blind to play at centre-back alongside Eric Bailly. <p> When they are defending -- a key part of any defender 's job -- it is not clear that Blind is the best option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's forwards possess. It would seem reasonable to guess that Mourinho will plump for Chris Smalling 's defensive solidity, possibly keeping Blind in the side at left-back in spite of Luke Shaw 's recovery from injury. <p> Shaw 's presence could be helpful on the counter-attack, but United will have to get beyond the Liverpool press to take advantage of that possibility. Blind might be better placed to work an opening around the onrushing forwards and full-backs. <p> On the right-hand side, Antonio Valencia 's strengths as an attacking full-back could be a little negated by the press. He will need a lot of support, as his close range passing is not the best, especially under pressure. <p> Masters of the pass : Chris Smalling, Santi Cazorla, Jordan Henderson and Jason Puncheon are the early Premier League passing kings???? **26;29;TOOLONG <p> If Smalling and Bailly do form the centre-back partnership, they too will need plenty of support from their midfield, and it could be that Mourinho opts for three in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide an extra man to act as a link between defence and attack. More deep-lying midfielders equals more options for the Bailly and Smalling when they are under pressure. <p> That would also offer a man-to-man option against Liverpool 's formation, assuming Klopp sticks with a 4-3-3. Michael Carrick 's physical limitations and lack of football so far this season are a significant barrier to his inclusion, but his ability to distribute the ball under pressure could be invaluable. His presence alongside Herrera could also free up Pogba as an attacking force. <p> Of course, Klopp 's high press comes with risk, and if Clyne plays at full-back on one side with Milner on the other, there will be space available behind them on the counter-attack. Both press a long way up the pitch. It will be intriguing to see whether Mourinho opts for the graft and defensive cover offered by Lingard or picks the incredibly attacking combination of Rashford and Anthony Martial to play either side of Ibrahimovic. <p> The former gives some degree of added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a difficult evening, but it would sacrifice some pretty significant attacking talent. <p> And this could be particularly detrimental to the right-hand side of United 's attack. While Milner has been in great form from an attacking perspective, his relative lack of mobility could lead to some good overload opportunities for Mourinho 's men. Valencia behind Lingard, though, might not be the best combination to exploit them. Though Valencia 's form has been decent of late, he has struggled to make a consistent attacking impact over the past few years. <p> This game may well come down to execution rather than the tactical plan. United should get chances on the counter-attack, just as Liverpool will no doubt get chances from their exciting-to-watch style. The margins here could be pretty fine, with individual form having a huge bearing on the result.
