2035841 A festive table well laid out is an unbeatable way to say " Welcome. " <p> There is nothing like an attractive table to make your guests feel welcome and, well, hungry! A light-blue color scheme chosen because it 's one of your guest 's favorite shades, or a delightful centerpiece of fall leaves and bright-red apples to top off a day of hiking, or even just a single wildflower in a tiny vase at each place setting all say the same thing : " Sitting down to eat together is an important and wonderful experience. " Of course, delicious aromas floating in from the kitchen are also inviting, but the meal begins when people take their seat and look at what is before them. It should be as well planned as the menu. Table-Setting Know-How <p> There are some people who believe that as long as everything is clean and neat it does n't really matter where you place your dishes and utensils. I am not one of them. I think it 's always important to lay your table out the correct way. This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proper way actually makes sense. For example, the salad fork because it is used first -- should be on the outside. Secondly, there 's something to be said for elegance and tradition. Sticking to " rules " does not mean you are old-fashioned or weird, but rather that you care. It 's that simple. So here are the basics. Silverware <p> A well-set table might have as few as three pieces of silverware at a setting, or as many as six or more. It all depends on the spirit of the meal, the occasion, the food, and the time of day. The simpler the setting, the more informal the meal. But no matter how you choose to serve, the rules remain the same : Placement is according to use. Each person begins with the outside utensils and works his or her way in. <p> On the following page is a simple illustration for a full dinner. Notice the order in which everything is placed. The salad fork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be used before the dinner fork( 2). The soup spoon( 3) is placed on the outside right of the knives, since it will be used before the knives. The dinner knife( 4) lies directly beside the dinner plate with the blade facing inward. The salad knife( 5) lies to the right of the dinner knife. Some people place both a dessert fork( 6) and spoon( 7) above their dinner plates. You may use them together, " European style, " to eat cakes or pastries. The spoon is used in place of a knife. Sometimes, a butter knife( 8) may also be included in the setting, resting across the bread and butter dish( 9). SILVERWARE TIPS If you are serving a quick meal, it is quite all right simply to set a fork, knife, and dessert spoon as described above. There is only one fork that is allowed on the right of the dinner knife, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, fork. <p> Depending on the way you are serving, the dinner table setting may include, as mentioned, the smaller bread and butter plate( 9) and the slightly larger salad or vegetable plate( 10), both of which are placed to the left of the dinner plate, or entree plate, as it is sometimes called. Many people, if they are electing to eat their salad course before the main meal, will set their table with the salad plate sitting on the dinner plate. You can also serve the salad " European style " : Here the salad, with a light vinaigrette dressing, is served after the main course and before dessert, to " cleanse the palate " -- the idea being garlic and chocolate souffle do n't mix! The soup bowl should always be served upon a plate, both of which should be removed when the course is finished. PLATE AND BOWL TIPS Salad plates often double as dessert plates, so if you have only a limited number as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in between courses so they 'll be ready for some delicious treats! Soup bowls come in two shapes. Consomme( 11), which usually has a delicate handle on either side, and a shallow bowl with a rim( 12), which looks much like the dinner plate. Generally, as the names indicate, light cream soups, thin broths, or consommes are served in the former, while thicker, chunkier soups are served in the latter. Glassware <p> Usually a single glass is placed at the top right of your place setting. On fancier occasions, a water goblet( 13) and a wine glass( 14) may be placed to the right of the plate instead. GLASSWARE TIPS The coffee cups and saucers( 15) come out with dessert and are placed to the right of the dessert dish. You can place your coffee- or teaspoon( 16) on the rim of the saucer. Never use very tall, slender drinking glasses unless you are serving iced tea or lemonade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about always with a straw! Napkins <p> The only rule that governs the placement of dinner napkins on the table is : Keep them neat and attractive. They can sit in any number of places : to the left of the dinner plates with the forks resting either on top or alongside, blossoming out of the water goblets as if they were flowers, folded neatly and resting flat in the center of the dinner plates, or shaped in any number of artistic ways and, again, set in the center of the dinner plates. <p> Here are some creative examples of napkin folding that may bring out the artist in you. NAPKIN TIPS Cocktail napkins, which may be used as coasters or to hold small appetizers when one is not sitting at the dinner table, are usually made of linen or decorative paper. They are quite small, as they are intended only to catch a few crumbs and protect furniture against water stains. Theirs is a small but important job, so do n't forget to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean and pressed. I prefer tablecloths when there are many people sitting at the table, because place mats with their clearly defined lines seem to add clutter to a table already laden with utensils and plates. The variety of tablecloths is endless, whether it be an embroidered one, or perhaps one that is hand-crocheted with solid-color cloth underneath, with napkins to match. <p> This home ec teacher in Stevan Dohanos ' 1957 Post cover might as well be telling it to the marines as to this class of homemakers who already know how to set a table. <p> SILVERWARE TIPS <p> PLATE AND BOWL TIPS <p> By Judith Re <p>
