2006041 Masterpieces of woodworkingbuilt piece by piece by piece by piece. BY RICHARD MUHLBERGER // MARQUETRY IS A CENTURIES-OLD TECHNIQUE OF ornamenting wood surfaces with an overlay of wood veneers that have been carefully cut and then glued onto the surface of the wood to form a decorative pattern. Transcending the ages and spanning many civilizations, the craft has been used to enhance, dramatize, and stylize artifactsbeds, boxes, chairs, clocks, secretaries, tables, even violin cases. Marquetry has never been a useful craft, called on to fulfill a utilitarian need. Instead, its role has always been to embellish, beautify, and satisfy the human desire to transform the ordinary. Although documentation of marquetry techniques dates back to ancient Egypt, Europe has known a continuous history of marquetry making only since the I7th century. Marquetry in America descends from this tradition, through the immigration of European marquetry makers in the 19th century. By this time, marquetry stood in opposition to the mechanical processes of the industrialized era : The labor-intensive process relied on painstaking handcraftsmanship and only the simplest tools-a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right:1 What Marquetry Is-and Is n't // This autumn, an exhibition featuring 70 pieces of marquetry selected from the remarkable collection of Marjorie and Robert L. Hirschhorn will be presented in " Masterpieces in Wood : American Folk Marquetry from the Hirschhorn Foundation, " a groundbreaking exhibition at the Museum of American Folk Art, in New York City. The show is dedicated to bringing to light and focus the many Americans who have practiced the art of marquetry, sometimes achieving local celebrity for their efforts, more often working in obscurity. IN COLONIAL AMERICA, TALENTED WOODWORKERS were almost as abundant as wood itself, and an unbroken tradition of carpentry was established. Early American woodworkers possessed the skills to make marquetry, but this type of ornamentation was not widely used until the Federal period, when it most often took the form of stringing or banding that adorned the edges of a piece of furniture. The popular taste for marquetry did not gain a strong foothold until after the close of the Civil War, and extended for go years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of mass immigration from Germany, many of whom were woodworkers trained in ornamental veneers. Photograph For left : // To produce marquetry, woodworkers must depend upon an assortment of veneers( thin layers of wood), a versatile saw, good glue, and planes. The earliest extant European marquetry, dating from the late Middle Ages in Italy, was assembled from wood chips gouged from planks with chisels and carved to size with knives. The fretsaw, invented in 1562, brought precision to the cutting and shaping of veneers. This lightweight saw, with its U-shaped metal frame and narrow-toothed blade of clockspring steel, is still in use and is also called a coping saw. In 1799, the foot-powered jigsaw was patented in Auxerre, France. Like the fretsaw, it had a blade that was strong enough to cut veneers and flexible enough to saw intricate shapes. A major difference from the fretsaw, whose blade is stretched like the string of a bow, is that the blade on the jigsaw is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sewing machine. Steam-powered sawmills, which were common in America by I830, made it possible to cut 15 to zo veneers to the inch of timber. Despite the mass production of veneers, however, many makers continued to apply hand methods to their work, particularly in the sawing of veneers. Detailed inventories associated with particular marquetry projects indicate that American marquetry makers used local woods, such as cherry and maple, as well as imported mahogany and many kinds of exotic woods. Even more colors could be achieved by staining. The range of designs that could be created through the use of cut and shaped wood veneers was seemingly limitless, from uniform geometric borders to elaborate scenes that sometimes created the illusion of paintings. THE HOURS OF LABOR NECESSARY TO ornament an object with marquetry made the pieces far more costly than most Americans could afford. As a result, the gift of a piece of marquetry was considered priceless, expressing the maker 's substantial investment of time and emotion.

While there was sometimes an opportunity for a craftsman to win prize money, documents demonstrate that a marquetry maker was mainly interested in showing how many hours he labored in making his masterwork, how many pieces of veneer were used, and, often, how many species of trees had sacrificed their wood. Industry and complexity were highly valued during the 19th century, and few man-made objects incorporated more of both qualities than marquetry.
