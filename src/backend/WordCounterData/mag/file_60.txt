The light spray cools our faces as we walk by, reminding us that autumn is just beginning to break summer 's tiring hold. The season revives the city and saturates it with such a merry attitude that you 'll find a festival here just about every weekend of the month. It is the perfect time to experience this vitality for yourself through K.C. 's offerings of delicious dining, artistic jaunts, and shopping excursions. Playing in the Plaza One of the most popular destinations in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district south of downtown. In 1922, J.C. Nichols built the plaza as the country 's first suburban shopping center. Inspired by his European travels, Nichols modeled the buildings ' architectural design on those from Spain, Italy, Portugal, and Morocco. Ornate towers rise from redtiled roofs, and ceramic mosaics wrap many of the walls. Fifty outdoor sculptures dot the paths among the plaza 's 150 stores. The fourth weekend of the month( September 24-26 this year), the city blocks off several streets for The Plaza Art Fair. In its 73rd year, the juried show invites 230 artists to share their paintings, sculptures, pottery, fabrics, and other visual arts pieces. Four stages host jazz, rhythm and blues, and rock ' n ' roll musicians. Half a block is dedicated to children and features the Kids Art Workshop and the Kemper Street Museum, both full of hands-on activities. You 'll also be tempted by the aromas emanating from vending booths set up by the plaza 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurants in the plaza, be sure to request an outdoor table at Classic Cup Caf. With the feel of a European bistro, this is a great place for lunch or dinner. Ease the sweet heat from the signature spicy Thai chicken pizza( $10) with a glass of wine while you watch passersby.

" We are mainstreaming organic, " says owner Jane Zieha Bell. " When people come here, they realize it 's not some far-out concept. They say, ' It 's like my grandmother used to fix years ago, because I can taste all the flavors. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheese mousse and arugula pesto( $7.50), and try the pan-seared salmon( $23) as an entre. Of course, you ca n't visit Kansas City without sampling the ' cue. One of our favorites is Fiorella 's Jack Stack Barbecue, a near-fancy restaurant in a renovated freight house behind Union Station. Bypassing the soggy plates and greasy wax paper wrappers, Fiorella 's opts for a more refined take on this city staple and is known best for their ribs( $13.45 half rack, $21.95 full rack). You 'll want to start with a Burnt End Appetizer( $6.45) -end pieces of beef brisket seared on the outside and tender on the inside. Photograph above, left to right : This marks the 73rd year that the city has hosted The Plaza Art Fair. The event features more than 230 artists and plenty of hands-on activities for the kids, below : Freshly dipped caramel apples from Russell Stover usher in fall. // Venture into the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art, and snag a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately find the 110-painting installation entitled The History of Art by artist Frederick James Brown. His work interprets artists and art throughout the ages and is sure to serve as a conversation piece during your lunch of crab cakes( $15) topped with zesty avocado salsa and served with roasted red pepper coulis. Mosey Through Wonderful Museums While you 're at the Kemper, take a free tour of the museum. A giant skylight in the center of the building shines upon a large atrium, and the light flows into the galleries. The bright and airy environment suits the collection of contemporary art, including works by such noted artists as Jackson Pollock and Georgia O'Keeffe. Before leaving, you may want to try to cheer up the Crying Giant by Tom Otterness, an 11-foot-tall bronze with his head in his hands out on the museum 's lawn. Take a stroll back to your childhood with a trip through the Toy and Miniature Museum of Kansas City. Housed in an old mansion, the collection of antique toys and miniatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spans 33 rooms. We were fascinated by the world 's largest marble display, but had our wives been along, they might have preferred the 100 furnished dollhouses and room settings. Something Sweet All those toys will make you feel like a kid again, so logically, your next stop should be a candy store. Get ready, though, because Russell Stover 's First Quality Stores offer so many wonderful chocolates and candies, we 're not even sure Forrest Gump could handle it. Headquartered in Kansas City, the chocolate and candy company distributes the best off the line( no seconds) to these shops ' shelves and cases( visit www.russellstover.com for locations). Some of the stores serve hand-dipped Blue Bell ice cream in homemade waffle cones as well as caramel apples( starting at $2).

We especially liked Christopher Filley Antiques and Decorative Arts, which specializes in architectural and garden ornaments. You might also want to check out the large collection of Country French antique furniture and pottery at European Express, just down the street. Much of K.C. 's charm comes from the city 's diverse people and flavors-merits attributed to its geography. Because Kansas City not only rests on the edge of the South but also at the heart of America, she enjoys the cultural influences of an entire country.
