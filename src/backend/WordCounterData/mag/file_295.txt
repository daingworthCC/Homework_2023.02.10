2035341 <p> Sheryl Crow is ready, finally to turn herself into a rock goddess. Less than 20 minutes before she 's scheduled to perform at a mid-size Dallas venue called the Bomb Factory, the singer is ensconced in her pink and purple tour bus, weighing the relative virtues of several mercillesly formfitting get-ups. Her band mates are scattered about, preoccupied with their own last-minute preparations ; her dog, Scout, lies on a couch, still catatonic from a tranquilizer he was given earlier in the day, before boarding a flight from Los Angeles to visit his mistress. There 's not a fashion consultant in sight ; Crow has to take credit for the metamorphosis about to occur. She insists that her basic profile is flawed, but her protests are contradicted by the physical evidence on display. " I have a flabby ass, " she says. " Really, I do. " I wish I could believe her. Really, I do. <p> Offstage, Crow is normally a vision of relaxed boho chic. It was in this guise -- ripped jeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around a finely chiseled face, no makeup, a touch of funky jewelry -- that she entered a suburban Dallas bar this afternoon. Making a promotional appearance for a local radio station, she sauntered into the joint with her usual earthy insouciance and blithely fielded the disc jockey 's questions about her hit debut album, Tuesday Night Music Club, and hit single " All I Wan na Do. " And then she sauntered out with the same casual, friendly air, acknowledging the small army of glazed-eyed and slightly terrified young men who had gathered there to see her with a smile and an occasional " Thanks. " <p> Ah, if only those gawkers could be watching her now : She 's wriggling into a skintight microminidress and high-heeled boots -- no need for nylons. Moments later, a transformed Sheryl Crow takes the stage for an hour-long set as Blues Traveler 's opening act. In spite of her flagrantly come-hither garb, or maybe because of it, Crow adopts an unforced, understated approach to seducing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensuality she demonstrated at the bar, the same hare hint of coy flirtatiousness -- a toss of the hair here, a knowing grin there. <p> Crow 's singing also projects a natural soulfulness and an effortless fluidity only hinted at on the studio versions of her songs. The same raspy soprano that sounds so playful on the breezy, tongue-in-cheek " All I Wan na Do " assumes a feverish intensity for more urgent numbers like " Leaving Las Vegas " and " Run, Baby, Run. " Crow easily reaches for whiskey highs and sinks to sultry, resonant lows. <p> " My songs are definitely written from a strong female perspective, " Crow says after the show. " I actually got a big response from lesbians when the album first came out. I think a lot of women felt they had found a voice that they could relate to. " <p> Refreshingly, Crow does n't resort to the types of post-feminist shtick that some of her peers might be accused of using. Not for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hatfield 's coy romantic ennui. Crow is a direct, down-to-earth songwriter, one who does n't shrink from prosaic issues like faith and taxes. She presents an image that 's less flashy, more ambivalent and probably easier for a lot of us to relate to. <p> Most of the time, anyway. As a woman who 's clearly, even radiantly aware of her femininity, Crow seems a bit disingenuous when she claims to be mystified by the particular enthusiasm she inspires in male fans. She 's no more convincing when she critiques her own flawless form -- a physique she claims she maintains without working out. " It 's a funny thing to me because I think I look so ugly in my videos, " she insists, almost keeping a straight face. <p> " I 'm not sure how much the feminist movement, particularly militant feminism, has done for women 's rights, " Crow says. " As far as I 'm concerned, women should he treated as equals, but we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compromise my femininity to be paid as much as a man or treated as well. " <p> Maintaining that balance between feminism and femininity is especially tricky in the pop mainstream ; it has taken Crow a while to be accepted on her own terms. Aside from the obvious classic-rock influences that inform the textures on Music Club, there are lyrics that convey brutal candor and celebrate independence, two virtues that -- before Madonna, at least -- were n't traditionally associated with light female pop. <p> Crow was first courted as a solo artist mainly by record-company executives who expected or wanted to make her over as a dance-oriented artist -- a disco diva rather than a singer/songwriter. " At the time, the women getting signed were in the vein of Paula Abdul and Lisa Lisa -- very pop stuff, " Crow says. " No heavy females. " <p> The 30-year-old Crow is no stranger to the pop starmaking machinery ; she got her start as a session singer. About eight years ago, only months after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael Jackson 's Bad tour. Jobs with George Harrison, Joe Cocker, Stevie Wonder, Rod Stewart and Don Henley followed. By 1989, she was also selling songs to other artists, including Eric Clapton and Wynonna Judd, that she had written. Her professional experience has given Crow plenty to draw on -- musically and otherwise. As the woman behind some very high-profile men, she had to take on some of the baggage that comes with being a babe in the entertainment business. <p> " As a backup singer, you know, I experienced all sorts of outlandish shit, " Crow says. " Everything from sexual harassment to rumors linking me with Michael Jackson, reports in the paper that I was having his baby. What I learned is that I have a lot of power as a woman ; I can either put up with bullshit or not put up with it. <p> " The thing is that when you 're in a difficult position, you must tell people where you stand right off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in situations where I did n't tell them. I had one experience with harassment that was a very ugly and uncomfortable situation. I learned that nothing is worth that kind of compromise. You have to know who you are and demand the respect that you feel you deserve, and I think I deserve as much respect as anybody ' else who 's doing what I 'm doing. " <p> SHERYL CROW GREW UP IN KENNETT, MO. BOTH her parents were amateur big-band musicians, and since their small town was near Memphis, Tenn., they usually found places to perform on weekends. " Then they would come home, " Crow recalls, " and jam in the living room until way late. Everybody drank and smoked cigarettes and had a great time. " As the years passed, the band that the couple played in dissolved, " and it really changed things -especially for my father, because I think that music was a really big outlet for him. He quit pursuing his dream. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " We Do What We Can, " deals with that dilemma. " I think what my father went through was representative of a time after the Vietnam War, " Crow says, " when people stopped nurturing the creative spirit in themselves. I wrote the song about him and that period. " Crow persuaded her dad to play trumpet on the track. He had n't played in 15 years, but it was perfect. " <p> In addition to introducing their daughter to all kinds of music, from big band and opera to the Beatles and James Taylor, the Crows -- Mrs. Crow in particular -insisted that Sheryl, her two elder sisters and her kid brother take piano lessons. Early on, Sheryl discovered that she could pick out songs by ear, later she was a keyboardist in high-school bands, and in 1984 she earned a degree in classical piano from the University of Missouri. " I 'm a well-rounded musician, " Crow says, " but I do n't do any one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good because I think that if you become too adept at something, you can lose touch with your sense of spontaneity. If you know an instrument really well, you tend to just go to all the familiar places. When we made Tuesday Night Music Club, the rule was that everyone had to play unfamiliar instruments. " <p> Actually, the sessions that resulted in Music Club evoke a scenario not unlike the late-night gatherings that Crow 's parents used to enjoy. When she first hooked up with the principal club members( Bill Bottrell, Kevin Gilbert, David Baerwald, David Ricketts and Brian MacLeod), she had just canceled what was supposed to have been her debut album for A &M; Records. Baerwald and Ricketts are probably the best-known dub members ; they 're the David and David responsible for the 1986 cult classic album Boomtown. One Tuesday night, Crow got a phone call from Gilbert, a friend, and Baerwald, whom she had met once previously. " They were at Bill 's studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, after they had already gotten smashed, and asked me to come out. I did, and we had so much fun ; we wrote ' Leaving Las Vegas ' right then and there, recorded it. And then we got together the next Tuesday night. " <p> What had started as a lark became a regular weekly event. The original purpose of these jams was to simply blow off steam and encourage camaraderie. " There 's not a lot of community spirit among musicians in L.A., " Crow says. She soon discovered that the album she had really wanted to make all along was taking shape. With Bottrell producing and everyone collaborating on the writing and playing. Crow achieved the loose, organic feel she desired. " And it was good for my confidence to be among those very healthy egos. I had to really stand up for myself, and that made me commit to my ideas. " <p> Crow cites Baerwald specifically as someone who encouraged that commitment : " I 'd talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' You should write about that. ' And I 'd think, ' Why? It 's boring, people wo n't be interested. ' But he kept telling me to write things down, and I did.... So what I thought was going to be really hard -- making an album -- became completely emancipating. And now I feel like there 's nothing I ca n't or should n't write about. " She pauses. " I mean, after I wrote that song about my dad, some things came out that painted my parents as these wild hippies. So I do feel protective when writing about people I know. " <p> Lately, Crow has been jamming and writing songs with another group of musicians : her touring band, which she put together while revisiting Missouri right after completing the Music Club sessions. The singer admits that touring with the musicians she had recorded with was n't exactly an option -- they all had gigs lined up. " That was a little weird, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gingerly. " But no one knew if I would become big. When you put a band together, it 's a crap shoot, and people do n't wan na be involved until they know. Now I 've got people crawling up my legs, you know? But, hey, I 've already got my band from Middle America, and we 're happy. " <p> Having been a supporting player on numerous occasions herself, Crow says that she continues to view herself as a member of a team. " I have that sort of band mentality. " And it 's plain that her band mates -- keyboardist and guitarist Scott Bryan, drummer Wally Ingram, bassist Tad Wadhams and guitarist Todd Wolf -- relate to her as a peer and as a buddy. They travel together and spend a good deal of time hanging out, sharing junk food and gossip, teasing their frontwoman about her love life -- which she admits can be erratic thanks to a weakness for musicians and dominating, uncompromising types. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " she says. " Not a musician. He treats me with respect. " <p> The musicians on Crow 's team also share her disdain for pop music 's emphasis on cultivating a cool image. They 'll unabashedly endorse Paul McCartney and Rod Stewart. " What we 're doing is n't about being hip, " Crow says. " My record was written for and about normal people with normal problems. I 'm not offering any taboo-busting shockers. I think that stuff is fly-by-night -- people see through it. Like the Charles Manson thing, where people were wearing Manson T-shirts, and musicians were starting to bring him up as a pop icon again. I was really insulted by that not only as a woman but as someone who remembers those murders from my childhood. I do n't remember Woodstock, but I remember that. As an artist, you 'd better believe your own words and stand by them, and I ca n't see any reason to believe that Manson is a cool figure. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say MANSON SUCKS. " <p> THE NIGHT AFTER THE Dallas show, Crow and band are with Blues Traveler in Austin, Texas, at a pretty outdoor venue called the Backyard. Crow 's friend Michael Ramos, a local musician who has performed with the BoDeans and Charlie Sexton, is sitting in with her band, playing accordion on " Strong Enough. " Backstage, Sexton, still a big star in these parts, holds court. Also present is a fan who has flown in from El Paso, Texas, to swap his early ' 60s Fender custom Telecaster for Crow 's brand-new -- but signed -- guitar. <p> " I think Sheryl 's great, " says a friend of the fan 's, a woman named Rita. " Feminine but strong. She 's sexy without pandering, you know? " <p> Meanwhile, Crow is addressing a packed house, proving Rita 's point. " This song goes out to all sexual harassers, " she shouts before kicking into the sizzling, sardonic " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the songs on Tuesday Night Music Club that alludes to her aforementioned experiences as a backup vocalist. " Do we have any sexual harassers in the audience tonight? " A group of beer-addled bozos whistle and grunt affirmatives. Crow regards them with no visible expression on her face. <p> " You suck, " Crow says flatly. Then, having told them where she stands, she begins to sing -- beautifully. <p> PHOTO : Sheryl Crow <p> PHOTO : 1987 's " BAD " TOUR : SHERYL CROW( IN WIG) WITH MICHAEL JACKSON <p> PHOTO : SOLO CROW : BEHIND THE SCENES NO MORE <p> BY ELYSA GARDNER <p> <p> Frequent ROLLING STONE contributor ELYSA GARDNER also wrote the foreword to " U2 " The Rolling Stone Files.
