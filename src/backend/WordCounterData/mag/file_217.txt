2026141 Getting ready for the morning rush to the day-care center ; Chicago administrative assistant Dawn Benjamin, her husband, Roy, and their 4-year-old daughter, Christine, coordinate activities. // FEW subjects fill working mothers with as much dread as child care. Words like harrowing, crazy and frightening always seem to find their way into any conversation on baby-sitting and day care. Dawn Benjamin of Chicago, whose 4-year-old daughter, Christine, has been enrolled in day care since the age of 2, knows firsthand the ordeal few mothers escape. " Sometimes it has been an experience from hell, " admits the 32-year-old administrative assistant for Ernst &; Young. " When Christine was in her early 2s and 3s, a lot of people just could n't deal with her. She would get into a lot of accidents at school and confrontations with the other kids. " Benjamin recalls the anxiety she felt the first time she left her little girl at the day-care center. " I was thinking, Is she going to be okay? Are they going to treat her right? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " she says. Naturally, such thoughts loom large on the horizon of a mother 's psyche, especially when nightmarish news of murderous nannies, pedophilic childcare providers, and general mayhem and neglect in day-care centers dominate daytime talk-shows and nightly newscasts. " Choosing child care is one of the most difficult choices for parents these days, " says Melinda Green of the Washington, D.C.-based National Black Child Development Institute, " especially because there 's so much media attention given to some of the hors of child care, that parents really worly about making the wrong decision. Although Green, who serves as the national director of the African American Early Childhood Resource Center, adds that the actual incidence of abuse in child-care settings is relatively low, statistics alone wo n't soothe a mother 's fears. What will ease some of the stress surrounding day care is becoming all informed parent and taking certain steps to make day care less of a dilemma and more of a delight for you and your children. Day Care or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children are in the workforce, some out of financial necessity others for personal aspirations. In fact, Green says that 65 percent of women with children under age 5 are working mothers. Which means that somebody has to " mind the babies " in mommy 's absence. But some working mothers feel guilty about leaving their children in day-care centers or with a baby sitter. They believe that they are depriving their children because they ca n't be with them during the day to nurture and bond with them, to watch them change and grow. Adding to this guilttrip are the ongoing studies and debates on whether children of working moms fare worse in the long run than children whose mothers stay home to raise them until they reach school age. " For a long time it was generally thought that children should be cared for by their mothers, " Green says. " And I 'm sure that 's optimal for most. But the latest research suggests that children in child care-if it 's good child care-do just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. So that argument has sort of been laid to rest. " What seems to have a greater impact on children 's development is not merely the number of hours a mother spends with her children, but how she spends that time. Benjamin, who works full time, says that she and her husband, Roy, a 44-year-old paralegal for Brothers &; Thompson, compensate for the time they 're away from their daughter during the day by having " a good family relationship in the evening. " They discuss what Christine learned in day care, and if they get a good report from her teacher, they 'll have a special treat for her when they pick her up from the center. Find Child Care That Meets Your Needs. Perhaps the most stress-inducing part of the day-care dilemma is the search itself. Some mothers are lucky enough to have grannies or girlfriends who do n't mind minding their children. But if you 're like many women out here, your family and friends probably have their own jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need it. And so you find yourself enlisting outside services. Cost and convenience usually are the primary factors many mothers consider when exploring day-care options, and for good reason. Day care can become a pricey undertaking. Although day-care costs vary by region and by age of the child, the U.S. Census Bureau reports that the typical Black working mother with a child under 5 spends about $240 monthly for child care. And the location of day care also matters, since mothers need a place that 's close enough to home or work in case of an emergency. Yet some mothers do n't look beyond cost or location when selecting day care. Benjamin admits that she chose her daughter 's first day-care center based on convenience-it was located in their apartment building. Experts say that while convenience and affordability certainly play roles in your decision, examining other, more intangible factors, such as teaching styles, methods of discipline, and the training and background of teachers and staff, can make the difference between a pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's needs and wants makes it easier to find day-care workers who share your philosophies on teaching and raising children. Investigate Before Handing Over Your Child. If you 're looking for child care, recommendations from friends and family are good starting points. Consider using a child-care referral agency. When the day-care facility in Benjamin 's apartment building closed, she enlisted the help of a referral service to ease her search for a new center. And she had a specific set of qualities she was looking for, from teachers with backgrounds in child development to a curriculum that emphasized learning as well as play.

Day-care experts say parents should investigate daycare centers carefully before making a commitment and should maintain a good relationship with teachers and daycare managers. // Check out the credentials of centers and staff. Call your local bureau of licensing to find out if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check if a center observes the state or locality 's health and safety standards-which you can obtain from your licensing bureau. If you 're thinking of hiring a private athome sitter, always request references and call them. Talk to other parents who have children enrolled in the facility you 're considering ; talk to the director, teachers and staff about their background and child-care philosophies ; observe a session so you can see the caregivers in action. Also, make sure the facility 's operating hours fit into your schedule. Many centers will charge extra if you arrive late to pick up your child. Ask if the facility allows flextime at no, or little, additional charge for those occasions when you ca n't come for your child before closing time. Check out the environment. Look around. Do you like what you see? Is the vibe right? Is your child comfortable with the place, with the people? " The atmosphere should be as welcoming as possible, " Green says. " There should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids can run, jump and climb. For African-American children, it 's particularly important to make sure the environment provides activities that make them ready to read and learn, and encourages their self-esteem so that they 're ready for school. " Maintain a Good Relationship With Your Child 's Teachers. Keep the lines of communication open with the people who take care of your child. " I see a lot of parents who just drop off their children and pick them up, and do nothing else, " Benjamin observes. " But my husband and I go in and talk to the teachers and ask them how Christine behaved. We let them know what we want and expect. And by doing that, things are better. " Schedule regular visits to your child 's day care. It does n't hurt to drop in unannounced once in a while either, since most reputable centers will have an open-door policy and wo n't mind the intrusion. Above all, remember that you and the person caring for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a healthy, welladjusted child. " The parent-caregiver relationship is important, " Green says, " the child may say their first word, or take their first step, and that requires sensitivity in informing parents of these changes without making them feel guilty or jealous. The relationship should not be competitive, but cooperative. " Put Your Child 's Needs First and Foremost. Your child 's feelings should come before any other factor in reviewing day-care options. Child experts say it 's normal for kids to feel some initial apprehension about being separated from you, but it 's up to you to make this transition as comfortable as possible. If your children are old enough, talk to them about their feelings. Let them know it 's okay to feel a little scared, and let them know that you 'll miss them, too. Reassure them that you 're not abandoning them and that you love them. Emphasize the positives. Get your kids excited about day care before the first day by telling them about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will meet. Take them shopping for a new outfit, a snazzy lunchbox, or a bookbag in their favorite color for their first day. And be prepared to deal with any jitters with love and a cool head. Even after day care has become a regular ritual for your children, it 's still important to talk to them about their experiences. And take what they say seriously. While most children will have their days when they 'd prefer your company to that of the most caring teacher or coolest classmates, pay attention to any drastic changes in behavior. Know the physical and emotional warning signs of abuse and neglect. If your child constantly tells you that she hates the place or the people, it 's up to you to investigate why and take action. " The first three years of life are the most critical for overall development, " Green says. " What happens during this time is very important for the rest of life. It 's not just baby-sitting, so you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and place for them. " <p>
