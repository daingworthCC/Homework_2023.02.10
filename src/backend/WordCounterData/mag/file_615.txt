4143541 Section : BLOODLANDS ADRIANOPLE Chokepoint Between East and West # Emperor Hadrian established Adrianople( present-day Edirne, Turkey) around 125 as a major Roman fortress city on the site of the ancient Greek town of Orestias in eastern Thrace. It occupies the main land bridge between southern Europe and western Asia. An army traveling that route had to capture the city to continue its advance. Adrianople sits at the confluence of three rivers that provide ready invasion routes into Macedonia to the west, Bulgaria to the northwest and the Black Sea region to the north. It is also the first line of defense for Constantinople itself, making it an important strategic location from antiquity through World War I. The city was the capital of the Ottoman empire from 1365 to 1453, and was the main logistical and operational base for Ottoman attempts to expand into Europe. The late military historian John Keegan( see P. 10) described Adrianople as " one of the most contested spots on the globe. " # 1913 The Second Balkan War broke out in June when Bulgaria attacked former allies Serbia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. A new Turkish government took advantage of the fighting among its enemies and drove the Bulgarian garrison from Adrianople, recapturing the city. Turkey then reneged on its previous promise to cede the city. The war ended a month later with Turkey in possession of Adrianople. # 1912-13 During the First Balkan War a combined Bulgarian and Serbian army of 150,000 men besieged Adrianople for five months( November 1912-March 1913), culminating in two night attacks that captured the fortress city. The siege included one of the earliest known uses of the airplane as a bomber when the Bulgarian fliers dropped hand grenades on the defending Turks. The victorious troops looted the city, especially the houses of Muslims and Jews, and came under international criticism for their harsh treatment of Turkish prisoners of war, some of whom they killed. # 1829 In support of the Greek War of Independence, Russia mounted a major offensive across the Balkans aimed at Constantinople. They defeated the Turkish army at Kulevicha on June 11. The Russians then crossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road to Constantinople wide open, Turkey had little choice but to sue for peace. The Treaty of Adrianople, signed that September, ceded the mouth of the Danube and the east coast of the Black Sea to Russia. # 1361 Ottoman Sultan Murad I captured Adrianople, following up on his predecessor Orhan I 's campaigns in Thrace that established the first permanent Ottoman settlement in Europe at Gallipoli. Murad defeated the Byzantine garrison just south of Adrianople, forcing it to retreat behind the fortress walls. Rather than suffer a siege, the city surrendered. The Ottoman capture of Adrianople marked the beginning of the end of Byzantine presence in the Balkans. In 1365 Murad transferred the Ottoman capital from Bursa to Adrianople, where it remained until 1453, when the Turks captured Constantinople and made it the capital. # 1355 Stephen Duan, the greatest of Serbia 's medieval kings, made steady advances on the weakened Byzantine empire, ultimately subjecting Macedonia, Albania, Thessaly, Epirus and Bulgaria to his rule. Duan captured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constantinople, but he died unexpectedly late that year. # 1255 The death of the Nicean emperor in 1254 inspired Bulgarian Tsar Michael Asen I to try to recover the territories lost to Nicea 20 years before. The 14-year-old tsar and his army invaded and occupied much of Thrace and Macedonia. But the new Nicean emperor, Theodore II Lascaris, moved quickly to block Michael 's further advance and in 1255 defeated him and his Cuman army in a major battle at Adrianople. That defeat presaged the decline of the second Bulgarian empire. # 1224 The Byzantine empire had fragmented into three states : The Latin empire of Constantinople under Robert of Courtenay, Nicea under John III Ducas Vatatzes and Epirus under Theodore Comnenus Ducas. Tensions led to a three-way war in which the Crusaders suffered two major defeats. Nicea took advantage of those defeats to capture Adrianople and threaten Constantinople, only to be repulsed by Theodore 's forces in a major battle that ended the war. The Latin empire abandoned all its possessions except for the eastern shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The European army of the Fourth Crusade sacked Constantinople in April 1204 in an orgy of violence and slaughter of fellow Christians. The remnants of the Byzantine army joined with their Bulgarian allies under Tsar Kaloyan to oppose the newly founded Latin empire under Baldwin I. The 50,000-man allied army met Baldwin 's Crusader army outside Adrianople in April 1205. The Bulgarian cavalry lured the Crusaders into an ambush, killed 300 knights and several thousand soldiers, and drove the survivors from the field. Baldwin fell into Bulgarian hands and died in captivity. # 1094 A pretender claiming to be Constantine Diogenes, a long-dead Byzantine general and member of the royal family, challenged Alexius I Comnenus, emperor of Byzantium, for the throne of the empire. Diogenes sparked a revolt, and with an army of allied Cumans, a nomadic people from central Russia, he laid siege to Adrianople. Alexius attacked and defeated them at the Battle of Taurocomon, and the city remained in Byzantine hands. # 1003 Tsar Samuel of the first Bulgarian empire renewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sacking Adrianople. Byzantine Emperor Basil II counterattacked, recapturing the city and advancing into Bulgaria, where he defeated Samuel at the 1014 Battle of Keidion. In one of history 's worst atrocities, Basil ordered the blinding of some 14,000 Bulgarian captives, leaving one man in every 100 blinded in only one eye to guide them back to Samuel. # 970 In 969 Svyatoslav I Igorevich, king of the Rus ' people, crossed the Balkan range with an army of 60,000 men to invade Thrace. His army laid siege to Adrianople in 970 and threatened Constantinople. The following year a Byzantine army of 30,000 infantry and cavalry commanded by John I Tzimisces besieged the Rus ' at Dorostolon and ultimately drove them back north. The Byzantine emperor had Svyatoslav ambushed and killed during the withdrawal. # 914 Tsar Simeon I of Bulgaria fought the Byzantines between 913 and 924 in an effort to seize the Byzantine throne. In 914 the Bulgarians threatened Constantinople for the third time in a decade but failed to take it. They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw open the gates and recognized Simeon as their ruler. # 813 Krum the Horrible, khan of Bulgaria, fought with three Byzantine emperors between 809 and 814 for control of Thrace. In summer 813 Krum defeated the army of Byzantine Emperor Michael I Rangabe outside Adrianople and advanced on Constantinople. Escaping an ambush, Krum ravaged the capital 's environs, then turned and captured Adrianople on his way home. He resettled its inhabitants -- including the parents of future Byzantine Emperor Basil I -- across the Danube. # 718 In June 717 a massive Arab army crossed the Hellespont and marched on Constantinople, sending a detachment to besiege Adrianople. Byzantine Emperor Leo III the Isaurian called on Khan Tervel of Bulgaria to meet the Muslim army at Adrianople while Leo defended Constantinople. Tervel 's army drove back the holding force at Adrianople, then attacked the rear of the main Muslim force, slaughtering some 22,000 Muslim soldiers. Failing to take Constantinople, the Arabs withdrew in August 718.

In July 378 a large Gothic army undertribal chief Fritigern ravaged Thrace and threatened Constantinople. Eastern Roman Emperor Flavius Julius Valens took the field in August, leading his army of some 25,000 against the Goths deployed around Adrianople. Valens rushed into battle without maneuvering room and before his army had fully deployed. Gothic cavalry swarmed over the unprepared legions, killing Valens himself and some two-thirds of his army. The battle convinced Rome the legion was finished as an offensive instrument. It also produced one of the momentous tactical revolutions of military history -- the eclipse of infantry by cavalry. # 324 Following the reorganization of the Roman empire and the 305 abdication of Emperor Diocletian, civil war broke out among commanders seeking the throne. After 20 years of intermittent war the two remaining rivals, Constantine I and Licinius I, met in battle at Adrianople in July 324. Constantine personally led his front ranks in a direct assault, while his right wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men slaughtered some 34,000 of Licinius ' troops. Licinius fled to Constantinople and raised another army, only to be defeated at Chrysopolis two months later. Licinius surrendered and was executed on Constantine 's order. # MAP : HISTORY 'S REPEAT BATTLEGROUNDS #
