5014741 <p> SoftBank Group announced today that it will launch its second Vision Fund with participation from Apple, Foxconn, Microsoft and other tech companies and investors. Called the Vision Fund 2, the fund will focus on AI-based technology. SoftBank said the fund 's capital has reached about $108 billion, based on memoranda of understandings. SoftBank Group 's own investment in the fund will be $38 billion. <p> It is worth noting that the second Vision Fund 's list of expected limited partners does not currently include any participants from the Saudi Arabia government( the first Vision Fund 's close ties to people, including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who have been implicated in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, has understandably been a major source of concern for investors, companies and human rights observers). <p> But SoftBank Group also said it is still in discussions with other participants and that the total amount of the fund is expected to increase. The full list of participants who have signed MOUs so far are : " Apple, Foxconn Technology Group, Microsoft Corporation, Mizuho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank, Ltd., The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, Limited, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Limited, SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., Daiwa Securities Group Inc., National Investment Corporation of National Bank of Kazakhstan, Standard Chartered Bank, and major participants from Taiwan. " <p> The maiden Vision Fund, which was announced in October 2016 and began investing in early 2017, has earned 62% returns to date, SoftBank said last month. SoftBank, known for consistently cutting checks of $100 million and larger, has invested in 24 of 377 unicorns globally( companies with valuation of $1 billion or more), according to research firm CB Insights.
