4107541 Material could harbor particle that 's its own antimatter twin <p> A new kind of superconductor ca n't make up its mind about how to conduct electricity. Current passes through its interior without any resistance, as in a typical superconductor. But its skin behaves like a metal, conducting electricity but with some resistance. <p> This split personality, described in the Nov. 18 Physical Review Letters, could be the handiwork of something strange hiding on the surface - a two-dimensional entity behaving like a Majorana fermion. First proposed more than 70 years ago, a Majorana fermion is a theo retical type of particle that is its own antiparticle. Electrons and quarks and other particles of matter all have oppositely charged antimatter partners. <p> Some theorists who suspect that neutrinos are their own antiparticles would be excited to find evidence that anything can act like a Majorana fermion, even the surface of the superconductor in the new study. Others hope that such particles could be useful for storing information in new kinds of computers. <p> " This is great, " says Robert Cava, a chemist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " Hopefully it will get people excited about this material. " <p> Cava and colleagues were the first to create the material, made of copper, bismuth and selenium layered like lasagna. They showed that it 's a superconductor at temperatures within a few degrees of absolute zero. But until now, no one had conclusively proven that this superconductivity is any different from the run-of-the-mill variety discovered in mercury a century ago. <p> To probe the material, Yoichi Ando of Osaka University and colleagues in Japan injected current into it using a gold wire. This excited electrons at the surface, creating ripples of energy. Conventional superconductors have a dead spot in their surfaces that prevents lowenergy, slow-wobbling ripples from forming. But a close look at this material revealed a sea of waves moving both quickly and slowly. <p> Ando says that this pattern of ripples is " unambiguous evidence " of a type of superconductivity never seen before : topological superconductivity, in which electrons become waves molded into a complex shape that resembles the outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be behaving like exotic twodimensional particles at the surface of the material - specifically, Majorana fermions. <p> " This is the best evidence so far for Majorana fermions in a solid material, " says Taylor Hughes, a theoretical physicist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Still, the new experiment did n't actually reveal the flat fermions themselves - only their supposed influence. No one has yet figured out how to directly detect them in solids. So it 's probably going to take many sources of indirect evidence to make the case that Majorana fermions actually exist in this material, says Hughes. <p> One way to test the idea would be to use magnetic fields to create swirling vortices on the material 's surface. These vortices should be able to trap a Majorana fermion. Sidebar <p> This material may contain exotic particles that could explain why the stuff behaves like a metal at the surface and like a superconductor on the Inside.
