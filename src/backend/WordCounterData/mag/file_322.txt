2039141 Alzheimer 's Disease Support Groups for Minority Families <p> With no cure or discovery yet of a drug or medical treatment to slow its progress, Alzheimer 's disease is a terrible tragedy for any family to face. But when the emotional strain of dealing with the disease and feelings of physical exhaustion are shared with a support group, caregivers seem to find more strength to cope. Not only do they gain emotional and even spiritual support, they gain practical help as well by learning from the support group about community services. <p> Unfortunately, this help is n't reaching caregivers from minority groups. A 1987 survey conducted in several states with large populations found that minority individuals made up only 6 percent of a sample of 2,300 caregivers who were using community services to assist relatives with Alzheimer 's or other types of dementia. <p> The notion that support groups for caregivers ought to reflect the American " melting pot, " that is, be culturally diverse, is a nice idea, but one that may not be helpful in creating the kind of supportive environment ethnic and racial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Jacksonville and Tampa, Florida, cities with large African American and Latin populations, when Alzheimer 's caregiver support groups failed to attract any minority families. This was the case despite the fact that the support groups had been advertised in all the conventional ways : in the largest city newspaper, on radio, billboards, and flyers. Also, the groups were held in what was thought to be a neutral setting at a local university. <p> In response to this situation, the National Resource Center on Alzheimer 's Disease at the University of South Florida 's Suncoast Gerontology Center developed a project to organize support groups specifically tailored to the needs of African American and Latin families in the two cities. This project, which was funded by the Administration on Aging, entailed an intensive effort to understand each group 's culture-especially its attitudes toward illness, caregiving, and the other issues raised by the presence of Alzheimer 's in a family. The project was particularly concerned about providing services in a manner that would n't conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Underuse of support groups by minorities is frequently attributed to their having little need for outside support because they have such well functioning kinship groups. This is n't true. A more logical explanation is that minorities are reluctant to attend a city-wide caregiver support group because they rightfully assume that the majority of the members will be white and reflect white attitudes toward illness and caregiving. <p> As principal investigator for the Alzheimer 's caregiver support group project carried out in Jacksonville and Tampa, I decided that our first task was to learn the " cultural map for living " used by ethnic caregivers so that greater cultural relevance could be woven into support group activities( see " Culture and Caregiving, " on page 29). Attempts at developing " culturally sensitive " programs have a long and checkered history. Many of these attempts have failed because the complexities of cultural value systems are often reduced to a program solution that simply matches the ethnic backgrounds and languages of clients and service providers and locates services in the heart of ethnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried out in the context of a traditional, depersonalized bureaucracy, precisely the aspect of the human services system most resented by ethnic minorities. We were looking for an entirely different model for providing supportive services, and through listening to community members, we arrived at one. Lessons from the Community <p> We learned several lessons in developing the caregiver support groups in Jacksonville and Tampa. First on the list is : <p> Leave the Desk! Understanding an ethnic community requires reading the literature, but the most important staff learning comes from getting out in the community. In becoming acquainted with ethnic communities, it is important to demonstrate personal qualities such as resourcefulness, initiative, flexibility, and open-mindedness which are valued far more than in-depth knowledge of the literature. After much leg work, project staff were able to identify, through social, church, civic, educational, health, and other organizations, key members of the African American and Latin communities who were willing to serve as liaisons or coaches to the support group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to significant branches of the community. At the same time, staff visibility in the community turned out to be the key to recruitment of support group participants. <p> The second lesson we learned was to test out the intervention models espoused in the literature about minorities before acting. My review of the community health literature on African Americans, for example, found ample support for the dictum that any change or introduction of services in the community requires the sanction of African American churches. I took this lesson to heart and sought help from an African American pastor, who accompanied me to several churches where I delivered what I thought was a scintillating presentation on the benefits of the support group and how this fit into the scope of the " missionary societies " that each church operated. At the end of each presentation, I announced the time and location of the support group meetings-at the pastor 's own church. <p> The first meeting attracted only three attendees : the pastor, a member of his congregation who had agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me. This occurred three times in a row. <p> I had overlooked a significant aspect of church " etiquette : " the loyalty of members to their own church created boundaries between churches that were too strong for members to cross. Even though the pastor 's church was conveniently located, in coming there members of other churches would have felt a sense of disloyalty to their own pastor because they were partaking of the fruits of others ' initiatives. As slight a consideration as this might appear to a bureaucratic service provider, it was important to these potential service recipients. <p> A similar error occurred in the Latino community. Holding support group meetings at a certain hospital in the Latino community was tantamount to showing allegiance to descendants of northwestern Spain, who had founded the hospital, in preference to immigrants with roots in northcentral Spain. While an American-born service provider might not consider this centuries-old distinction significant, it was very significant to the Latino community. <p> Our analysis of the ethnic communities suggested that a neutral site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethnic neighborhood. For the African American Alzheimer 's support group, the culturally neutral location turned out to be a branch of the public library in a black neighborhood. For the Latino caregivers, a privately owned medical clinic, operated by Latino physicians, located in the heart of a traditional Latino section of town worked well. They Lead, We Follow : Let the Users Determine Format <p> At the end of 2 years, the project had established three minority support groups. Attendance at these groups ranged from two or three at the first meetings to more than 20 caregivers at the peak of the project 's recruitment efforts. These groups developed their own character and format, a format that was markedly different from that of the communitywide Anglo group. Generally, the minority support groups were much less formal, with frequent, loud, and animated interactions. There was much more interpersonal contact. Members felt comfortable sitting in a circle and telling richly detailed stories about their families and their own lives which, in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> One aspect that was noteworthy among the groups was the different meaning and role of refreshments. Typically, at Anglo citywide support group meetings, the refreshments take up a very small part of the evening. Yet they are frequently sumptuously presented, with carefully tiered vegetable platters, delicate sandwiches, and decorative pastries. The aesthetic presentation of the food is as important as its eating. In the Latino group, the refreshments formed a large part of the evening, seeming to provide spiritual or emotional nourishment as well as eating pleasure. The members of the group -- predominantly of Cuban descent -- shared not only Spanish, but in many cases, kinship and friendship linkages going back generations. The generous display of the traditional " dulces, " or sweets, seemed to symbolize the feeling that all members of the group were part of a family. <p> In the African American group, on the other hand, where affordability was an issue, refreshments assumed a much less significant part of the evening. But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host 's selections. One evening I brought a six-pack of Classic Cokes and a box of cookies. Another woman had brought a six-pack of generic cola and home-baked cookies. What came out during the meeting was that, in her mind, my contribution of Coke and store-bought cookies, rather than being seen as a welcoming gesture, only emphasized the economic differences between us, making her look bad and reinforcing my position as the well-paid white professional. From then on, organizing refreshments became a group task. Who would bring the refreshments to the next meeting was planned in advance so that it could be budgeted by that individual into the week 's spending. Sometimes, everyone chipped in. It was understood that the most basic items were the appropriate ones. Caring for a Grandmother <p> The support groups were eventually able to reinforce cultural strengths and supplement traditional community support systems. For example, an African American family-the Johnsons-provided a good example of intergenerational caregiving consistent with this culture 's value of interdependence and mutual cooperation. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his maternal grandparents and was very willing to accept responsibility for the care of his grandmother when she was diagnosed as having Alzheimer 's disease. Asked how he felt about his caregiving role, Ben explained that he had assumed most of the responsibility of caring for his grandmother because his grandfather had become too depressed to do so. Ben was totally committed to this task. " Right now a normal person would come to me and say, ' why do n't you put your grandmother in a home, get married, and have children? ' I ca n't do that because this lady made sacrifices for me when she could have been places and seen the world. " <p> One thing the group provided Ben was accurate information about Alzheimer 's disease, and advice on medical referrals. At the same time, his grandfather benefited from the emotional support offered by the group. He realized that he was not the only person in the world to be facing retirement and end-of-life issues. He was able to connect with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Older Immigrants, Resistant <p> In the Latino community, older immigrants often were especially resistant to attending the support groups. This was partly because these older immigrants had been forced in their younger years to survive by their own wits, without benefiting from the social policies or services that are now focused on more recent immigrants. Often the only way to get the older people involved in the support groups was through their children or grandchildren who, because they were born here, are more familiar with the service system. <p> This was the case with the Lopez family. Mrs. Lopez was the primary caregiver for her husband who had Alzheimer 's disease. She was first brought to the meeting by her son, and then her daughter-in-law. Mrs. Lopez was very ill at ease at first, confining her comments to pleasantries, such as complaints about the weather or compliments on the Cuban coffee. However, after several meetings she began to feel comfortable enough to talk about her long, unhappy marriage to Mr. Lopez, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a month, Mrs. Lopez was attending the meeting by herself, having been " car-pooled " by other members of the group. As a result of encouragement from the group, an aide started coming to the home to give Mr. Lopez a bath twice a week. It was now clear that Mrs. Lopez was speaking openly and freely within the group setting, having been phased into the support group family. Mal de Sangre <p> In ethnic families, feelings about Alzheimer 's disease are sometimes related to cultural values regarding mental illness. A manual published by the Suncoast Gerontology Center on organizing support groups for ethnic caregivers observes that " Alzheimer 's disease carries with it symptoms which the general public would interpret as characteristic of someone who is ' crazy. " ' The stigma attached to mental disorders is well known within Hispanic and other cultures, the manual notes, adding that, " For many Hispanics, mental illness is still seen as a dreaded affliction akin to ' mal de sangre ' or ' bad blood. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Garcia family. Mr. Garcia had suffered from dementia for several years and was cared for at home with help from relatives. In the support group, Mrs. Garcia described her shame and reluctance to ask for help. She said that former friends avoided her due to " fear of the disease " or just feeling uncomfortable about being in her home. " I tell you one thing about the Spanish, they will get very upset about someone who is crazy or does crazy things. "( She hastened to add that this was due to a lack of education and not to being of Spanish descent.) Even during a time when her husband was so confused that he was urinating on the living room floor, Mrs. Garcia tried to put up a front that everything was okay to her neighbors and even to her own children. But so great was her own personal distress that she wondered at times if God were punishing her for some past sin. <p> One night, Mrs. Garcia was forced to seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garcia not in bed or anywhere in the house. So she got in her car and scouted the neighborhood for him. Only after searching by herself proved to be futile did she return to the house to call neighbors for assistance. One of the neighbors finally found Mr. Garcia about two miles from home " just in his briefs, " with blisters on his bare feet. While Mrs. Garcia was very anxious about her husband 's safety, she said the public nature of his " crazy behavior " mortified her. <p> Mrs. Garcia 's daughter was the support group 's liaison to the Latino community. Like Mrs. Lopez, Mrs. Garcia had initially not wanted to attend the group meetings. But her daughter prevailed upon her to come to several meetings where, according to her daughter, her mother was comforted by the discovery that others were in the same boat. Mrs. Garcia also began to use some in-home community services after receiving assurance from the group that such help was acceptable. <p> What 's ethnic about these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all families experience intergenerational caregiving or attach a stigma to Alzheimer 's disease. It is often the younger generation who introduces its elders to new things, regardless of ethnic or cultural affiliation. Women are expected to be the primary caregivers in most if not all families worldwide. It should be pointed out that there will always be cultural overlap. What makes an attribute ethnic is its different frequency of occurrence, its intensity of value, or its likelihood of expectation. Personal Contact, the Key <p> One of the most important lessons learned during the course of the project was this : there are ways to deliver services effectively that do not require sterile professional/ client relationships or the coldness of a bureaucratic setting. Our project staff had more personal contact and more awareness of minority families than they had previously experienced as service providers. They got to know the names, histories, and current status of individual family members. <p> Interaction was not limited to the once-a-month support group meetings. Staff members frequently called families who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in matters relating to institutionalization, legal matters, and daily care. In some respects, they became members of the extended family, with a relationship bordering on that of kinship. It became clear that this was the key to outreach in minority communities. Minority caregivers wanted to see that service providers were flesh-and-blood people before they would trust them. <p> The experience of developing ethnic minority Alzheimer 's disease support groups in Tampa and Jacksonville has made it clear that 1) there are many Alzheimer 's disease cases in ethnic minority communities that are not receiving the benefits of support group intervention ; 2) such an undertaking is a long, labor-intensive process( in the Florida communities, outreach efforts required a full year before even minimal results were forthcoming in support group attendance ; 3) an understanding of ethnic minority cultures is essential ; 4) liaison with ethnic communities is a must for effective program start-up and maintenance ; and 5) perhaps most important, constant personal contact with the caregivers and their families is necessary in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> For more information, contact J.
