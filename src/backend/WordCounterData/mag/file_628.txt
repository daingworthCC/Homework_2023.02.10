4144841 Readers ' Tips to Live By # Schoolchildren 's Urban Oasis # I am a teacher at a K-through-12 school in Bangkok, and in the past year we have transformed our concrete rooftop into a thriving vegetable garden. The rooftop garden gives our students the opportunity to learn valuable gardening skills. We also sell our organic produce to the parents and staff, which provides income to buy more seeds and supplies. Students have been involved in the process from the beginning. # One of our first priorities was to build about 50 raised garden beds. We were able to do this thanks to a donation of 100 wood pallets. Staff and students dismantled each pallet one by one and rebuilt them into 6? -by-2? -foot beds. The gardening crew lined the beds with old plastic sheeting that had previously been used for advertising school events. As time has gone by, we 've built more garden beds. We have also started making our own compost, and we 're about to begin experimenting with aquaponics -- the garden coordinators just sent out a request to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Thailand # Eco-Minded Trash Recycling # My partner and I are committed to keeping as many items as possible out of the landfill. We often drive through a neighborhood the day before trash pickup to fill the bed of our truck with other people 's " trash. " What we can not use ourselves we give away via the website www.Craigslist.org. # We also donate many items to local thrift stores. I guess you could say we work on reducing other people 's environmental footprints. # Deb Joyce Titusville, Florida # A Patchwork of Pallet Projects # My husband has been collecting discarded wood pallets and shipping crates for years. Businesses that receive pallets and shipping crates include hardware and appliance stores, building supply outlets, and manufacturing businesses. The pallets are usually stacked next to dumpsters and are free for the taking. Discarded wood pallets and shipping crates are everywhere ; you just have to know where to look! # We burn the pallets that are n't in the best shape to get free heat during our frigid Vermont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood shipping containers), my husband has built a greenhouse, toolshed and storage shed. He 's also fenced our garden and put siding on a barn. # For the next wood pallet project, we 're going to replace the living room carpet with wood pallet flooring. Yes -- we have enough pallets to do this! # The cost of the wood pallets equals only the cost of the gas to go pick them up. Not only are we keeping the pallets out of the landfill, but we 're also doing the businesses a favor by saving them the trash fee. # Kitty Werner Waitsfield, Vermont # There 's No Place Like Earth # My wife and I have been on a journey the past few years that started with a simple vegetable garden. We now compost everything we can, and we even built our own compost tumbler out of scrap materials. We also make our own natural cleaning products, deodorants, salves and tinctures, as well as flea sprays for our pets. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our new environmental mindset. # Since gaining this viewpoint, every decision we make is with a sense of responsibility toward the life around us. We have an awareness of where our resources come from, what it took for them to get here, and what we will leave( or not leave) as waste. We now have the mindfulness to see that " the environment " is just another way of saying " our home. " # I 'm proud of our new outlook, because, more than any one choice we make -- more than toting reusable shopping bags or driving a Prius to lower our carbon footprint -- this perspective will continue to influence every action we take for the rest of our lives. # Aaron Miller Olympia, Washington # Have You Herd? Raising Goats for Milk and Meat # My household believes that a big part of living sustainably is reducing our reliance on commercial products. For this reason, we have taken to raising goats for meat and milk. Our ladies provide us with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with enough left over to pound out a couple of loaves of bread in the afternoon. After the kids have been weaned, we have even more goat 's milk for an evening hot chocolate or atole( a warm, corn-based drink). Goat meat is a healthy and flavorful occasional addition to our diet as well. It can be cooked for a broth, hung to dry with lime and salt, or cooked estilo barba-coa( barbecued). # Camille Torok de Flores Moroleon, Mexico # A Recycler 's Mantra # To reduce our environmental footprint and save money, our family of six has ardently employed the simple strategy of " Reduce, Reuse, Repurpose, Recycle. " We 've quickly learned that focusing on the first of these -- reduce -- dramatically downscales our need to employ the remaining three parts of the mantra. In fact, this past year, we were able to ask our recycling company to cut in half the number of times it picks up our recycled goods( our bill also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a shift to bulk whole foods, which have little to no packaging.( Bulk up your money savings and waste reduction with food-buying clubs. See Page 53. -- MOTHER) # When brainstorming how to reduce trash production, we had the idea to establish a bin for items that could be reused and repurposed rather than recycled( or discarded as trash). Among the items that make their way into this bin are unusual wine or other alcohol bottles, which we cork and then use to serve chilled water at our dinner parties. # John Atwell Oakton, Virginia # Scratch That # We live in Southwest Florida, and our raised-bed garden lies in a flood plain. Every year our pond floods, so we decided to create a flood channel that leads straight to the garden. Dug by hand? No -- dug by chicken. # We put out corn and scratch grains in a path to the garden, and after about a year, the chickens had dug a nice, deep flood channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first several months of the gardening season we do n't need to water, because the ground is already nicely saturated. # We also keep rescued waterfowl in a secure enclosure at night with a 30-gallon kiddie pool full of water. We dump the manure-infused water into the flood channel to be carried straight to our garden. # To avoid the slight risk of transferring pathogens to your food supply, you should only apply water containing fresh manure during a season when food crops are absent, or use the water in your orchard. -- MOTHER # Kelly McCormick Duette, Florida # Trash, Trinket or Treasure? # I reduce waste with the help of the nonprofit, community recycling website www. Freecycle.org. There 's almost always someone out there who will think your " trash " is reusable, and Freecycle.org can put you in touch. I 've freecycled so many things that would have otherwise ended up in the recycling bin, including packing material, boxes, pet food cans and the cardboard tubes from paper products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Example # My husband and I are proudest of teaching our two children how to live environmentally friendly lives, and of showing them how we can reduce our environmental footprint as a family. We try to lead by example : We have a rain barrel and a garden, shop at the local farmers market, drive a hybrid car, and much more. We believe that showing our children models of environmentally conscious living is the most important step we can take toward a more sustainable future. # Kristy Severin Ashland, Virginia # A Pinch of This, Plus a Bit of That # It 's the little things that count when you 're striving to live an environmentally friendly life. What may seem like small actions on their own -- such as installing a water-saving shower head, putting a timer on your hot water tank or insulating windows -- create substantial changes over time. You can unplug electronics when you 're not using them, switch to compact fluorescents( CFLs) and LEDs for lighting, and install heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chill in winter. All of the little things really do add up to make a big difference. # Daby Napthine West Clifford, Nova Scotia # A Hand-Dug Backyard Pond # I 've always wanted to have a backyard pond to store rainwater on my property and to enjoy as a beautiful oasis. I 'm also interested in experimenting with an aquaponic system. # I plan to fill my in-progress pond with rainwater collected from my house, so last fall I rerouted all of the downspouts to drain from one corner of the house. The underground pipes I 'm going to install will travel about 60 feet from my house to the pond. # I recently discovered that my city has a stormwater-quality grant program for people looking to establish rain gardens. I applied, and I was awarded up to 50 percent of my project cost! That 's significant, because the 30-by-40-foot pond liner was expensive, and I had to purchase pumps, piping and more components. The grant program is a fantastic incentive to help people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. No gym fees required! # Wayne Johnson North Liberty, Iowa # Earth Day focus # In honor of Earth Day, we asked readers to share the Earth-friendly actions they are most proud of taking for this edition of Country Lore. We were delighted to hear from people around the world who have made changes to significantly reduce their environmental footprints. -- MOTHER # Conserve Fuel With a ' Wonder Box ' # I work with a small group of volunteers in the Western Cape of South Africa that 's showing the region 's low-income residents how to save precious fuel by using a hot box to cook their food. Inhabitants of these shanty areas rely on purchased gas, paraffin or hand-gathered wood for fuel. Our volunteers teach those interested how to prepare a meal with a hot box and a 16-brick rocket stove, which uses 75 percent less fuel than a conventional stove. When a pot of food has reached a hard boil on the rocket stove, the cook transfers it from the rocket stove to a hot box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box design the " Wonder Box, " and it 's made by sewing soft cotton or broadcloth into a circular shape that will wrap around your cooking pot. We use polystyrene beads, which are a form of insulation commonly used as packing material for electronics, to stuff the Wonder Box shell. You can also stuff the cushions with wool or nylon materials, newspaper, sawdust, hay, or wood shavings. To learn more about making a Wonder Box of your own, go to http : //goo.gl/3ZETxm. # Elma Hunter Stanford, South Africa # If you try a hot box, you should return the food to a boil on the stove if its temperature has dropped below 140 degrees Fahrenheit before the food has finished cooking.

Eighty percent of my food is from a no-dig permaculture garden that was built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little more than a gallon of water heated by a self-designed rocket-stove shower that runs on 3 ounces of biodiesel. # We are building a skills center for which more than 80 percent of the construction resources will come from our immediate surroundings. We 're building with cob and also making the doors and windows on-site. We 're making durable cob cupboard doors from sticks and plaited grass rope, as well as chairs, tables and beds. I go to town once a month by public transportation -- 118 miles round-trip. # The best part of this way of life is that I can teach others the ways I have learned to be self-sufficient. It 's an ongoing process that 's exceptionally rewarding. # JP van der Walt Eastern Cape, South Africa # We Pay for Top Tips # Do you have handy home, farm or garden advice?
