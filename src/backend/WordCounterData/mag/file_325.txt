2039441 Remarks by Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services <p> Presented July 19, 1993 at the National Job Opportunity and Basic Skills Training( JOBS) Directors Conference, Arlington, Virginia. <p> I 'm pleased to have the opportunity to talk with this morning about welfare reform -- one of the Clinton Administration 's top priorities. <p> One of my top priorities. <p> First, I 'd like to tell you about a woman from Virginia who wrote a very thoughtful letter to President Clinton right after the election. <p> She told the President that she has relied on AFDC for nine years while caring for her severely-disabled, fourteen year-old son, Jarrod. This woman has received only four child support payments from her ex-husband in all those years. The grand total of the last one was four dollars and sixty-one cents. <p> She wants to work, but, realistically, she ca n't afford to lose her son 's health benefits. She wrote to the President : " The only hope I have to gain employment is to wait until Jarrod 's 18th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medicaid is no longer dependent on total family income. " <p> This story demonstrates how far welfare has wandered from the transitional program it was intended to be -- and how little hope it inspires. <p> There are millions of other stories like it. Stories about people who struggle to leave welfare -- only to be pushed back by a barrage of work-related expenses. Like child care, transportation to work, and rent increases for those who live in subsidized housing. <p> Our welfare reform strategy is based on a simple notion : welfare must be a temporary, transitional program that builds on core American values -- work, family, opportunity, and responsibility. <p> Values we want to preserve and pass down to generation after generation, so that we always remain strong and united as a people. <p> Our current system does n't reinforce these values, and no one knows it better than you -- who are working on the front lines implementing JOBS programs in all 50 states and territories. <p> You know that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workforce. And that others were the children of welfare recipients and barely know there is another way. <p> Since the late 1980s, the number of families on welfare has grown steadily. So has the number of families in poverty, and the amount of money federal and state governments spend supporting the poor. And so has the paperwork, the complexity, and the perverse incentives that make the welfare system such a nightmare for administrators and recipients. <p> Aid to Families with Dependent Children is a $22 billion-dollar-per-year system that too often penalizes work, stigmatizes recipients, and many times locks families into a cycle of dependency, <p> It 's time to find a better way. <p> After years of attacking the problem in only a piecemeal way, it 's time to find fundamental solutions. Comprehensive solutions. Solutions that build on the best and most effective work that you are doing with your customers. <p> President Clinton has a deeply-felt commitment to welfare reform. As Governor of Arkansas, his innovative ideas enabled thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development of the Family Support Act of 1988. <p> We owe both the President and New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan a debt of gratitude for their vision and tenacious work on a program that pointed us in the direction of continuous change. Many of your own governors have laid out similar visions. <p> My personal commitment is just as passionate. In the 1980s, when I was President of Hunter College in New York, we developed a program to provide single parents with an undergraduate education -- and social service support. The program created futures, and moved bright young people from the welfare rolls to the tax rolls. <p> Everybody wants change -- recipients, legislators, tax payers, and all of you who provide social services. <p> Later in your careers, I hope you will look back on this as a watershed moment in the history of our welfare system. A moment that you helped shape with your work and your voices and your minds. <p> Last month, the President appointed a Working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group is led by David Ellwood, the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation at HHS ; Bruce Reed, White House Deputy Policy Advisor ; and -- as soon as she gets confirmed -- Mary Jo Bane, the nominee for Assistant Secretary for Children and Families. <p> These are major policy thinkers who know the human face of welfare, and I firmly support the work they are doing. They will help us develop a plan that is bold and that is fair. <p> It will be a plan that addresses the diverse causes of welfare, and not just the consequences. <p> A plan that keeps people from having to enter the welfare system in the first place, while enabling others to get the short-term help they need. <p> Our work is guided by four basic principles : Making Work Pay <p> First, work must pay. The way things are right now, having a full-time job does not guarantee that you will live above the poverty line. As a result, people lose their incentive to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't reflect those very values I was talking about. Everyone has something to contribute. And in our great country, no one who works hard and plays by the rules should have to raise children in poverty. <p> Our proposal to dramatically increase the Earned Income Tax Credit, or EITC, will give people an economic incentive to choose work instead of welfare. The EITC is a work-based, refundable tax credit designed to make sure that work pays for low-income families. The President 's economic plan makes a strong investment in this bipartisan program. <p> Our EITC expansion will essentially lift above the poverty line all families with four persons or fewer in which the head of the household is working full-time, year-round. <p> It will be a building block of comprehensive welfare reform -- a powerful first step at encouraging people to join and stay in the labor market. <p> Health care reform will also enable people to move from welfare to work. For years, we 've ignored the link between the health care crisis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of insurance for low-wage workers -- drag down many Americans as they struggle for self-sufficiency. As a result, people who want to work must stay on welfare for years, simply because Medicaid is their only source of health security. The President 's health care plan will remedy this injustice. We will ensure that all Americans receive comprehensive health care at a reasonable cost. Under our system, work will pay -- and it will provide health coverage. Better Child Support Enforcement <p> Our second welfare reform principle is that we must build a far better system of child support enforcement. Right now, twelve million children have parents who could pay child support but do not. This is a national disgrace. <p> Both parents have a responsibility to provide for their children. As President Clinton has said, governments do n't raise children ; people do. <p> When one parent abandons that responsibility, we all pay the price -- but the person who suffers most is the child. We must tighten up on enforcement while making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a legal father -- over 500 thousand children born each year. As a result, these children are often deprived of financial support, not to mention love, encouragement, and guidance. <p> We must improve our capacity to establish paternity at the hospital, right after childbirth. This is critical. There is no better place to get fathers -- especially very young men -- to accept legal responsibility right away for their children. Strengthen Education and Training <p> Our third principle is one that hits home to you. We must strengthen education and training -- and provide other support necessary for recipients to move into the workforce. <p> In this area, your work is critical. Today, 520,000 Americans are enrolled in JOBS programs to help them reenter the workforce and regain independence and dignity. <p> I admire the work you do -- offering families a passageway into the mainstream. <p> But, to make the welfare rolls shrink, we need to increase the number of AFDC recipients active in programs to help them get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of current law are being met, less than sixteen percent of all non-exempt AFDC mothers are actually enrolled in JOBS programs. That is not nearly enough. <p> We need more of the great JOBS success stories that come from your programs. Stories like that of Joyce McLaughlin, a Louisiana mother of three who found herself homeless after separating from her husband. <p> Desperate to support her children, Ms. McLaughlin moved into a shelter in her home town and applied for AFDC. It was a bitter pill to swallow, since she had worked for much of her adult life. <p> Then she learned about a local JOBS program called Project Independence. The program provided some transitional support -- child care assistance and bus passes -- which allowed her to hunt for work. Now she works full-time and has moved her family into an apartment. <p> Then there 's Beverly Curtis, a 19-year-old mother from Oklahoma. Ms. Curtis moved rapidly off welfare with the help of a JOBS program that combines training and work experience. She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a month, she got an even better job as a computer operator. <p> Beverly Curtis and Joyce McLaughlin are only two of the millions of Americans who just need a little help to get back on the road to independence. <p> That 's how the system is supposed to function -- providing transitional support to families in trouble, heading off further pain and hardship. And then, parents or guardians getting opportunities to find work -- and piecing their lives back together again. <p> The families stay together, and the children learn lessons about courage and responsibility that they will pass on to their children. <p> Work. Family. Opportunity. Responsibility. That 's what I call success stories. <p> We can make these stories the rule, and not the exception, for millions of Americans. Expect People to Work <p> But that wo n't happen without the fourth principle, which may be the most important of all. We must expect people to work. We must tell healthy people -- in no uncertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Once the major elements of welfare reform are in place, it is critical to set time limits, after which we should require able-bodied recipients to find jobs in the private sector or, if necessary, in community service. <p> I want to emphasize this point in a loud, strong voice. I 've heard people question whether the Clinton Administration has the " stomach " to impose time requirements. <p> You bet we do. <p> There has to be a time-certain period, beyond which people do n't draw a check for doing nothing when they can do something. <p> We need to create a new sense of responsibility among all Americans -- including those receiving public assistance. And there 's no more compelling reason to do this than our children. <p> We have to remember the children of Joyce McLaughlin, and of Beverly Curtis. We must offer these children a vision of hope and responsibility. Welfare reform will help renew these values for our children -- who will make up the society of tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wo n't happen overnight. It will take time and courage and leadership. There will be disagreements. There will be unexpected challenges. And we will need your support and your ideas along the way. <p> We will accomplish this landmark social achievement -- and it will be worth it. As the President has said : We must reform welfare " not by punishing the poor or preaching to them, but by empowering the poor to take care of their children and improve their lives. " Thank you. <p> PHOTO : Donna E. Shalala <p>
