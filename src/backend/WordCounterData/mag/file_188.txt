2022641 Section : U.S. News ; Cover story Creeping paralysis has also become a fact of life in many statehouses <p> Most Americans ca n't remember the names of their own state legislators, much less be bothered to worry about lawmakers in other states. But then, most Americans have never heard of California Assemblyman Pat Nolan. A heavyset Republican from affluent Glendale, Nolan in 1982 sponsored a deregulation of California-chartered savings and loans so sweeping that it made Washington 's thrift decontrol look like a straitjacket. Thanks to Nolan 's law - and similar ones passed in Texas, Florida, Arizona and elsewhere - state-chartered thrifts are responsible for about two thirds of the staggering S &L; bailout. <p> Once political nobodies, America 's 7,546 state legislators are becoming pivotal players in the country 's economy and politics. They control not only congressional redistricting but a host of national issues, from welfare reform to abortion. Much of that influence has been inherited from a federal government stymied by deficits and interest groups. Unfortunately, statehouses from Albany to Honolulu are starting to suffer the same ills. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " serious fiscal difficulty, " according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. A growing number of legislators are in jail or under investigation for possible corruption. And a new culture of careerism and interest-group money is evolving - a culture, says political scientist and Michigan State Senator William Sederburg, that " makes it nearly impossible for legislators to make tough political decisions. ' These flaws will only get worse this fall, as state legislators from both parties, eager to control congressional redistricting, stockpile record amounts of special-interest money for their 1990 campaigns. <p> Thirty years ago, the average state legislator was a low-paid part-timer who did something else for a living( as do legislators today in smaller states such as Vermont and South Dakota). Lacking much in the way of personal staff or independent campaign organizations, these citizen-legislators were dominated by legislative leaders and governors who controlled patronage machines. During the 1960s and 1970s, all that began to change. Legislators in the major states became well paid, full-time professionals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence from governors and political-party bosses. Legislative staffs mushroomed, giving state lawmakers more control over both issues and agendas. <p> For instance, 20 years ago only the executive branch had the computers and staff members to run complex budget projections. Today, budget committees and even individual lawmakers have that ability. " Information is power, and we 've institutionalized that power, ' says Sederburg. This sophistication coincided with Ronald Reagan 's New Federalism, which gave states more responsibility for everything from repairing bridges to cleaning up the environment. <p> For a while, the states seemed to rally to the challenge, acting as the " laboratories of democracy, " that Justice Louis Brandeis once labeled them. While Washington dithered, states like New York and Oregon succeeded in passing tough pollution-control laws and no-frills medicare coverage for the uninsured. <p> But as the policy action shifted from Capitol Hill to statehouses, so too did big-money influence. In Georgia, for instance, the legion of lobbyists quadrupled from 280 in 1970 to 1,019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state-level lobbyists in America - 5.7 lobbyists for every legislator, according to an Associated Press survey. <p> Meanwhile, the decentralization of leadership has made consensus harder to build and easier to shatter. Commanding a majority on any issue is " difficult at best, " admits Illinois Senate President Philip Rock, one of the country 's more powerful legislative leaders. It takes longer to pass a law in a state legislature today than 10 years ago, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Yet the number of bills considered by all state legislatures, about 200,000 annually, has remained about the same, and legislatures have 40 percent more staff to help them. <p> The fractured power structure has made it easier for lobbyists in some states to pass their preferred bills. In the last days of the 1987 session in California, for instance, the tobacco industry slipped in a never debated amendment indemnifying itself from product-liability suits. In other states, lobbyists have more difficulty passing bills but less trouble killing them. Prof. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such lobbying organizations " veto groups. " <p> Critics contend that an epidemic of timidity aggravates the paralysis. Well-paid, full-time legislators naturally fear losing re-election by offending interest groups more than did their part-time predecessors. ' ' They have no other profession besides the Legislature, ' complains New York Governor Mario Cuomo of the new breed. ' ' They can not afford to lose. ' <p> Lobbyists prey on this fear with the threat of stirring up grass-roots opposition - and also of withholding money. State legislators need lobbyist money for the same reason congressmen need it : Rising campaign costs. Where legislators once threw $10-a-ticket barbecues for voters in their home districts as a way of generating campaign funds, today it is $200-a-plate dinners for lobbyists in the capital. Pennsylvania State Senator Craig Lewis recalls spending a then hefty $37,000 on his first successful campaign in 1974, a campaign he ran by himself, " literally out of my rec room. " By the time of his most recent race in 1986, Lewis had turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gauge the political views of individual voters in his district. Computers then sent slick, tailored direct-mailers to those voters. Lewis 's cost : $190,000, a 500 percent increase over his 1974 spending. According to a National Conference of State Legislatures survey, campaign costs doubled from 1982 to 1988. Spending on all state races reached $500 million in 1988, says USC 's Alexander, who estimates that this year 's cost will reach $1 billion. <p> The predictable result of all this special-interest cash and legislative career-mindedness is lawmakers who can not be dislodged. During the 1960s, one third of all state legislative seats turned over every electoral season. In 1988, only 16 percent changed hands. Incumbents win by bigger margins today, too. <p> ' It 's Washington writ small, ' complains Thomas Kean, who served New Jersey both as a state legislator and as governor. He, like other critics, insists that states have n't reached Washington 's level of dysfunction. True enough, though citizens of Massachusetts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not agree. The overall trend does not inspire confidence. In major areas of public policy, states are showing signs of what Alan Rosenthal of Rutgers University 's Eagleton Institute of Politics calls " creeping paralysis. " Some examples : <p> No-fault auto insurance. Acclaimed by economists and motorists alike as the best way to settle claims and keep insurance premiums low, it continues to flounder in state legislatures. Blame it on the trial lawyers, whose PAC 's consistently rank among the top funders of state-office campaigns. Of the 16 versions of auto-no-fault that lawmakers passed in the 1970s, all but three were riddled with counterproductive loopholes that in effect let no-fault policyholders retain the right to sue. Auto-insurance rate increases slowed only in Michigan, New York and Florida, the three states that passed tighter no-fault laws. <p> A second wave of no-fault bills, brought on by skyrocketing premiums in the 1980s, fared no better. No-fault died in committee in California in 1986, thanks to the legislative handiwork of Assembly Speaker Willie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after three attempts, Pennsylvania 's Legislature managed to strengthen its no-fault law. But even State Senator Craig Lewis, who voted for the law, admits it contains holes " trial lawyers will be able to drive trucks through. ' <p> Prison reform. For years, prison officials have begged lawmakers to expand prison industries, which put convicts to work making everything from license plates to circuit boards. Taxpayers, they argue, gain when prisoners pay for some of their own upkeep. So do inmates, who learn skills while earning pocket money - part of which can be docked for child support or victims ' compensation. Guards and wardens benefit, too, because boredom and idleness among convicts invite trouble. <p> But even as state inmate levels doubled in the last decade, legislatures kept a lid on prison industries despite encouragement from the federal government to expand them. Since 1979, the federal government has promoted a concept called " private sector/prison industries. ' The effort encourages private companies to set up factories and service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal initiative, yet only 5,000 convicts nationwide have jobs under it. " It 's an idea that nearly everyone on the left and right thinks is good, ' says prison consultant Barbara Auerbach. " And then things happen. " What happens, explains Wisconsin State Senator Barbara Lorman, is that reform efforts bring out " lots of enemies in the business community. ' In 1988, Lorman helped Charles Yost, gung-ho chairman of the Wisconsin prison system 's Badger State Industries( BSI), get lawmakers to allow private firms to run in-prison factories, but not before Wayne Corey, lobbyist for the state 's furniture and janitorial-supply industries, won a concession : BSI had to stop selling convict-made metal desks and laundry services to local governments and nonprofit groups. The result : Zero increase in prison jobs for an inmate population that has grown by 13 percent in three years. <p> Labor leaders also squelch prison industries out of fear that convicts will take jobs away from law-abiding unionists. When California Governor George Deukmejian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federation Executive Secretary John Henning called the idea " slave labor. " Henning succeeded in making opposition to Deukmejian 's plan a litmus-test issue for Democrats, who received $173,550 in contributions from the labor group last year. The governor was forced to take an initiative drive straight to Golden State voters, who will decide the issue next month. <p> Medical licensing. State legislatures are supposed to keep an eye on medical boards, which in turn are supposed to yank the licenses of incompetent doctors. But during the 1980s, scandal after gruesome scandal befell these physician-dominated organizations. After a jury last year convicted a California doctor of misusing labor-inducing drugs and killing eight newborns, the judge who heard the case called it " a testament to the abject failure ' of the state 's medical board. Incidents like this led legislators in California and two-dozen other states to toughen the regulation of medical boards. Medical discipline has improved. But the 50 state medical boards punished only 2,600 physicians in 1987, the last year for which data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that more than 200,000 cases of medical negligence occur every year. <p> Even on minor matters, swift, decisive action is not a defining quality of state legislators. The Maryland Legislature, for instance, took 11 years to decide the less-than-vexing question of whether optometrists should administer diagnostic eye drops during ocular exams. Ophthalmologists, fearing encroachment on their turf, argued that the optometrists were n't qualified - even though 49 other states grant optometrists the right. State Senator John Bambacus calls the " eye-drops bill, " which became law last year, a " cash cow, " suggesting that the interminable length of debate was due to legislators ' eagerness to maintain the flow of campaign funds, restaurant meals and theater tickets provided by lobbyists on both sides of the issue. Maryland Delegate Royd Smith denies that contributions slowed the process, but cheerfully confesses that " my social life was not the same after I voted for that bill. ' <p> Economic development. During the 1980s, states like Michigan and Iowa won praise for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinvigorate their economies. Most state economic-development efforts, however, involved granting favors to major in-state corporations, damaging the national economy in the process. <p> Typical is the recent rash of antitakeover laws corporations marshaled through legislatures in Indiana, Massachusetts, Ohio, New York, Wyoming and other states. Free-market conservatives denounce these laws as unwarranted government intrusions allowing corporate executives to escape the consequences of their own mismanagement. Thus, when Pennsylvania in April passed the toughest antitakeover law in the nation, Forbes magazine dubbed it " Socialism, Pennsylvania Style, " failing to mention that the law 's sponsor, Pennsylvania State Senator Noah Wenger, is a conservative Republican. Ideology counts for little when state legislators are struggling to keep jobs at home. <p> Antitakeover laws proliferate in part because corporations can threaten to move operations to states more to their liking. This same tactic helps companies win special tax breaks, which drain money for schools, roads and other projects states need to attract industry. Some 38 states now offer such tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are beginning to fight back. Ballot initiatives are on the upswing in the 26 states that allow citizens to go over legislators ' heads. Some 40 initiatives and referenda were filed in 1984, 75 in 1990, a sign, says John Keast of the conservative Free Congress Research Foundation in Washington, D.C., of a " growing frustration among issue-oriented people. ' The most telling initiative passed last month, when Oklahomans slapped a 12-year limit on state legislators ' terms. Similar measures in Colorado and California are likely to pass this fall. <p> States are also under public pressure to reform their campaign-finance systems. Twenty-eight states do not even limit PAC contributions to legislators. Disclosure requirements tend to be lax, and understaffed, poorly organized monitoring agencies are running jokes among statehouse reporters. Loose as campaign-finance laws are, politicians have somehow managed to run afoul of them. Ironically, the loudest complaints are coming from lobbyists, who say the ever-increasing costs of fund-raisers are straining their budgets. In March, the New Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The call came only after a lobbyist charged five top Assembly members with threatening to block her group 's favored legislation unless she contributed $20,000 to their campaigns. <p> The declining performance of state lawmakers is something neither party likes to dwell on. It undermines Republican faith in the innate superiority of states over Washington and embarrasses Democrats, who control most statehouses. But unless they do something to improve the system, state legislators may one day - perhaps as early as next month - suffer rough justice at the polls. DISHONOR ROLL : <p> Corruption has grown in state capitals this term : <p> GUILTY : Eleven legislators convicted for bribery, including three each in South Carolina and West Virginia and two in California. <p> CHARGED : Seven others indicted in South Carolina. THE INSIDER : <p> Pennsylvania Senator Noah Wenger is a 14-year Statehouse veteran who describes himself as " a moderately conservative Republican. ' But when the Belzberg family this year made a raid on Armstrong World Industries, many of whose officers and employes live in Wenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, sponsoring a law forcing raiders to " disgorge " short-term profits and letting boards put community interests above those of shareholders. <p> Critics say the law merely protects incompetent managers. Institutional investors have threatened to divest themselves of the Pennsylvania-based company 's stock. But if there is a price to pay for sponsoring the law, Wenger has n't felt it. He 's unopposed for re-election this fall. THE REFORMER : <p> Senator Barbara Lorman does n't mind pushing for the highway bypasses that voters in her rural Wisconsin district care so much about. She has a passion, however, for helping a group who ca n't vote : Prisoners. Within her district are three prisons with nearly a third of the state 's inmates. Lorman champions a program that teaches skills through prison-based jobs. <p> A Republican who ran her late husband 's scrap-iron business, Lorman is no bleeding heart. She notes that the program actually saves taxpayer dollars. But voters do n't care about the issue. And key business leaders and their lobbyists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the statehouse political system : " The general public has given up its power to the lobbyists.
