4153441 IDAHO 'S SUN VALLEY IS 78 YEARS OLD AND IT 'S STILL THE BEST PLACE TO GO FAST. # HURTLING PELL-MELL DOWN SUN VALLEY 'S Limelight run, Greg " Chopper " Randolph keeps stretching the distance between us. This happens a lot. Chopper, 41, has dedicated his life to velocity : An elite bike racer, he won the U.S. National Time-Trial Championship and battled for the Stars and Stripes( alongside Lance Armstrong) at the 1996 Summer Olympics. On skis, the University of Idaho grad bends low to the snow, getting aerodynamic to maximize his face-melting speed. # Thing is, Chopper never completely disappears from view. Not because I 'm pinning the needle too, but because Bald Mountain boasts the loooonngest fall lines conceivable. As long as I haul ass at the edge of my comfort zone, Chopper 's bright green jacket remains in sight. # Sun Valley, founded in 1936 as America 's first destination ski resort, remains relevant for many reasons, chief among them as a place to put the hammer down. It 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that perfect for channeling a Franzwhether Olympic downhill champ Klammer or speed-skiing legend Weber, who once hit 138 mph. The groomers are impeccable, with 645 snowmaking-blessed acres. Baldy 's steep pitch and ideal slope put Sun Valley on any serious skier 's must-ski list, even though the Idaho snow gods can sometimes be stingy. # FYI, this will be the 1,357th Sun Valley article to mention that Ernest Hemingway killed himself in Ketchum. Was he depressed because he could n't keep up? Maybe. People here go sofuckingfast. Sun Valley natives Gretchen Fraser, Christin Cooper, and Picabo Street won five medals in Olympic ski racing. No wonder Bob Smith invented the double-lens ski goggle in 1965 in Sun Valley ; the human eye ca n't approach Mach 5 without protection. # Chopper executes what is seemingly his only turn of the day at the maze for the Challenger lift. As always, the Warm Springs base slaps my senses upside the head with the stench of sulfur, a byproduct of the aforementioned warm springs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the most of any chair lift in North America. Again, credit Baldy 's amazingly consistent tilt, which is never disturbed by ridge, plateau, or inconvenient drainage. # The way I see it, Sun Valley affords a fella with nicely tuned edges the chance to attain his highest speed per vertical foot schralped. We peel off the lift and onto Warm Springs. One of the globe 's all-time great thigh-burners, Warm Springs plummets more than 3,000 vertical feet over three miles, uninterrupted by flats or roads in a relentless charge to a river called Big Wood. Insert dick joke here. # With 280 days of sunshine a year, Sun Valley is every bit as dry as the name implies. There 's no use pretending the high desert of the Great Basin is some BC-like powder kingdomit clearly is notbut when visitors get lucky, the surface is fluff instead of the finest corduroy a ski ever carved. That 's actually what happens the week I trail Chopper. It 's awesome. We ski not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champagne-powder contrails. #
