2028641 Nearly half the league will begin the season with a new starting point guard, but making a change at the " one " always is a delicate experiment By DAVE D'ALESSANDRO // Looking back, Mark Jackson says it was like walking into a room filled with a dozen people, all talking at once, their voices a discordant blur and the conversation pitched too low for him to understand. He was certain he spoke the Knicks ' language when he came over in a trade from the Raptors last February. He had worked with coach Jeff Van Gundy before, there was nothing about the Knicks ' system he had n't encountered already, and he even felt the kind of comfort and familiarity that comes with returning to his hometown. Now, Jackson admits he did n't know what he was getting into. Only once in his 14-year career had he changed teams in midseason, but that was very different because he returned to an Indiana team he played for only months earlier. " I was brand new again, and they were new to me as teammates, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Knicks last February. " The thing is, I did n't want to just come in here and take over. So I pretty much held back all those things I would normally say and do, because I did n't want to step on their toes. It was a tough, tough situation. I 'll never forget it " Over the next two months, there were some minor successes, a few glimmers of hope. But even as the Knicks claimed they could respond to the kind of leadership Jackson provided, the offense often ran as smoothly as a rhino in high heels. For the first time in a decade, the Knicks were bounced out of the postseason in the first round. An unsettled point guard situation, which is not uncommon in New York, was one factor in the team 's demise. " It had nothing to do with the players, " Jackson says. " It had to do with me. " Such laments are as old as John Stockton. Take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taking over a new team as the starting point guard is one of the most difficult things to do in basketball, " says the Spurs " Terry Porter, 38, who has done it as successfully as anyone. " Number one, you have to take it upon yourself to know the ins and outs of a new system because you are responsible for directing everybody. Then you have to get used to the personnel and their skill level : what they need to do, what they like to do-which is not always the same thing-and what they do n't like to do. And most of all, you have to become the leader, because that 's the most important part of the job. " Changing of the guards Nearly half of the league 's teams-between 11 and 13-will have new starters at the point guard position this season( last season began with only three such changes). Seven teams will hand the job to players who come from outside the system, and all of them will have challenges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ league 's best players and teams are making changes. In Phoenix, Stephon Marbury will be asked to inspire Penny Hardaway to play and inspire the fans to return. In New Jersey, the Nets need Jason Kidd to help them purge a quarter-century of wretched luck and farcical blunders. In Sacramento, the Kings are asking Mike Bibby to be the difference between style and substance. Grant Hill, a career small forward, is testing out the position in Orlando, and even last season 's finalists, the 76ers and the Lakers, will have to experiment until their starters return from serious injuries. Some teams will succeed, others will fail miserably. In most cases, the point guard will be credited for the former or blamed for the latter. And with few exceptions, the point guard will accept either fate, because he considers it part of the job description.

" We all understand what we have to do. There are going to be new schemes, new plays. But when you get right down to it, it 's playing basketball. And the point guards who have changed jobs or cities, it comes down to executing and making sure you take care of the ball. It is a challenge. Some guys are up to it, and some guys are n't. You find out very quickly who 's up for that challenge. " Orlando coach Doc Rivers, who changed teams three times in his playing career, believes the first step is credible leadership. " You have to get a team 's trust early, " Rivers says. " With a guy like Kidd, I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand, when you have a point guard like Stephon, who is more of a scorer than the guys in Phoenix are used to, you could see problems if things do n't work out early for them. " Wiser is better Because a point guard 's greatest development often takes place between the ears, it is said that veterans stand the best chance of adapting to a new environment or greater responsibility. Consider Avery Johnson, who signed with Denver in the offseason. At 36, he ca n't run the Nuggets with the same flair as starter Nick Van Exel, but he is not going to be caught unprepared. He knew that during the very first practice, when he connected with Antonio McDyess on a pair of alley-oop passes for dunks. " It was n't osmosis or anything, " Johnson says. " I 've just been watching Nick throwing him the same passes. Because of the explosion of TV-and because I 'm a quote-unquote basketball junkie-I watch basketball all the time. It 's easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year as opposed to my fifth or sixth year. " " You might get slower as you get older, but you get wiser, " Porter says. " You have a better feel for how the game 's going, knowing its rhythms, knowing which guy 's number to call. " It is n't their intent to question the logic of turning a team over to someone without experience. Johnson and Porter believe that every point guard has to start somewhere. In San Antonio, however, the transition carries some risk. Antonio Daniels is the Spurs ' point guard now. It is a job Johnson held for 61/2 years, and it 's a job Porter did far better than Daniels a year ago. The numbers proved it : With Johnson out because of injury, Daniels tried his hand as a starter, and the Spurs went 11-8. Then Porter took over, and the Spurs won 30 of his next 37 starts as Daniels slid over to shooting guard. But it 's Daniels ' turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handing a title contender over to a novice. Least of all Porter. " He 's athletic enough, he can get his own shots, and he 's getting better by the day, " Porter says. " We talk a lot about what he has to master, how to be creative without overlooking our strengths. Now the important thing is staying in control, running the team and getting the coaching staff 's trust. " The same scenario is being tried at Golden State, which is giving Larry Hughes a spin. The purists shudder. Hughes is not exactly a pass-first point, his assist average( 4.5 per game last season) notwithstanding. Nor has he been durable, missing 32 games last season. But he has the endorsement of the team 's star, Antawn Jamison, and the Warriors hope that force-feeding him responsibility will pay off sooner rather than later. " The one is his position, " Jamison says. " Though he has n't played it, he 's always had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think we can be successful without him. I see him as a successful point guard. " Mookie Blaylock, who will start if the Hughes experiment fails, is less effusive : " Point guard 's a tough job, " says Blaylock, entering his 13th season. " Eventually, he 'll get it, though it takes time. If not this year, next year. " Mark Jackson does n't have that luxury. He is not new to his team, but he is 36, and he believes that half a season and a full camp will make all the difference. " Night and day, " he says. " It 's much tougher to change in midseason. That 's not an excuse ; that 's reality. " Photograph Kidd says the Nets can make the jump from 26 victories to a.500 record this season.

A few hours later, he arrived at his first practice. Exhausted from a five-hour flight the night before and already sleep-deprived since the arrival of twin daughters earlier that week, he immediately tried to make up for lost time. The Nets went through a shooting drill early in the session, and Kidd volunteered for rebounding duty. He threw passes in the general direction of Keith Van Horn-some a foot high, some a foot wide. He flung a few dozen at Kerry Kittles, at times intentionally throwing them toward the shooting guard 's sore knees or at his head. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, how quickly they could retarget the rim, their shooting rhythms, even their expressions. " A game within a game that I play, " Kidd explains. " High, low, at the chest. Just throw it where they have to reach for it to see where they are better at catching and shooting. Or do they need to put the ball on the floor first? I was just feeling them out. " The subtleties of passing are not lost on Kidd, who led the NBA in assists the last three seasons. The subtleties of leadership are more elusive, though he is off to an excellent start with his new teammates. On the night before the first practice, coach Byron Scott decided to test Kidd. After Kidd arrived at his hotel, seconds away from stepping into the shower, Scott called to let him know he would be the team 's captain. " And I want you to address the team in 20 minutes, " he added. Sidebar This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. He made that clear in his first press gathering, shortly after he and Stephon Marbury traded jobs, by announcing he believed the Nets would be a.500 team this season. It was an extraordinary statement. The Nets won only 26 games last year and have reached the postseason once in the fast seven seasons. To suggest they will be in the playoff hunt-by virtue of changing just one player-is more optimistic than anyone in New Jersey has a right to be. " It is a leap, " Kidd admits. " When you look at this team, it 's very young -- our oldest guy is 30. But I just felt we had to set a goal. Maybe I 'm speaking out of turn, but I 've come from a team that won 50 games a year. I 'm not used to anything less than.500. That 's where I thought we should set our goal as a team, and if we do n't believe in that, then we wo n't be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covers the NBA for the Newark( N.J.) Star-Ledger. // <p>
