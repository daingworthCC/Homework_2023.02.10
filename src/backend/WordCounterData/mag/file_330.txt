2039941 A pair of California gardeners make the most of a steep slope <p> WHEN GARDENERS set out to find a home, what they really are looking for is a suitable yard. Realtors across the country are left baffled by gardening clients who give only a rudimentary glance at the features of the house, but race outdoors to examine in detail the condition of the lot, its orientation, and the availability of such commodities as light, soil, and water. Often the magic words " I 'll take it " depend more on the possibilities presented outside the walls of the castle-to-be than inside them. <p> Such was the case eight years ago when Kent Gullickson, a soft-spoken nurseryman-cum-technical support person, and Joe Frankenfield, an insurance company vice president, went hunting for a place to live in Oakland, California. What the realtor showed them ' was a sturdy, elegant structure built in 1926 with two floors of light, airy rooms neatly tucked into one of Oakland 's characteristic hillsides. What Gullickson and Frankenfield saw was a steep, walled entryway on which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top of the garage( it was covered by a foot or so of soil), and a 75-by-50-foot backyard that slopes up from the house on which to grow a rich assortment of plants. Not that the southeast-facing lot was devoid of greenery. At the time, the yard featured a lacy, pink-flowered tamarisk tree and a medley of some 30 rosebushes, which were hopelessly mired in masses of blackberries, ivy, and " thankfully thornless " cotoneaster. A stunning arborvitae( " the kind most people plant on either side of the front door until they grow together ") served as the focal point of the backyard, accompanied by a mysterious citrus tree whose provenance was " probably a seed from a grapefruit someone ate in the fifties. " The previous owners ' guiding mission, " Keep things back! " was clearly evident. Fortunately, Gullickson is blessed with the gift of imagination and the fortitude to take out what he does n't want, and, fortunately, Frankenfield is willing to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission determined -- " to create a haven of privacy in which to grow intriguing plants. " <p> Although establishing a guiding principle for a garden is fairly easy to do, its execution generally requires tackling a multitude of muscle-straining obstacles. Here, the wild tangle of growth had to be cleared and the hillside terraced to prevent erosion and provide places in which to relax and entertain. This exercise revealed thick, rocky, clay soil. The next step was to add a foot and a half of topsoil to create a more congenial, better-drained environment for plant roots,( Even so, the water-retaining clay used to create seeps in wet winters, which flooded the basement of the house and occasionally posed problems for the arid-land plants of which the two are fond.) <p> How to screen the rear garden from the surrounding houses was one of the pair 's next concerns, although that issue obviously required more time to solve. Large plants that grow quickly in this microclimate, which hovers between USDA Zones 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slope, including Sparrmannia africana, a somewhat tender tree with large, lobed, velvety green leaves ; giant timber bamboo( Bambusa oldhamii) ; and spiky Cordyline australis, accented by the drooping white-and-purple-tinged blossoms of shell ginger( Alpinia zerumbet) and creamy yellow, deliciously fragrant butterfly ginger( Hedychium coronarium). These provide extra protection against the wind and form a semitropical backdrop for the lush, intricately textured carpet that now invites the eye downward from the oval lawn of the upper terrace, through the wonders of the mixed border, and onto the lower terrace that acts as an extension of the house. <p> Initially, the carpet was English in feel, with pretty clusters of foxgloves, Penstemon ' Huntington Pink ', scabiosa, verbascums, and the invasive-but-endearing Impatiens balfourii. " We used these plants as binders at first, " Gullickson notes, " because they were easy to grow, bloom readily, and take up space. And the penstemons can be kept clipped if necessary to get a late-summer flowering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, which were eventually replaced instead of replanted. <p> Although traces of the old standbys remain, the tapestry has become decidedly Mediterranean in feel, with a touch of the tropics and a textural rhythm ' that hints of Japan. Exotic foliage plants and succulents, such as aeoniums, aloes, agaves and cotyledons, predominate. <p> " Visitors from colder climates are often taken aback when they come to the garden, " Gullickson says, " because they are accustomed to seeing many of these plants in pots and conservatories, rather than in the ground where they can grow to full size and be combined with other things. " <p> Edible plants, such as herbs, tomatoes, and salad greens, are also cultivated, though the lack of space relegates them to niches in pots on the lower terrace and wherever there might be space between the ornamentals on the sunny hillside. " One of nicest things about our garden " Gullickson says modestly, " is that it is protected from the coldest and harshest winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so well. We also get sun from the south and the east. It travels down the hillside, starting at the upper terrace in the morning, and baking the lower terrace in the afternoon. " <p> Along the winding stone path that conducts guests through the garden 's various levels, bold architectural forms bolstered by soft mounds of blossom demand attention at significant intervals. The broad, red-striped leaves of three Phormium tenax plants, for example, create a loose triangle around the upper terrace lawn, while the hefty, pink-tinged bells of Brugmansia ' Frosty Pink ' can be seen to the left of the upper terrace and again on the right of the garden farther down.( Another Brugmansia cultivar, ' Charles Grimaldi ', makes a spectacular show over the garage in front of the house, bearing as many as 30 golden blossoms per branch for most of the summer.) In between, your eye is captured by the silvery, somewhat menacing form, of a six-foot Melianthus major, echoed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silvery Macleaya cordata, whose rusty undersides are accentuated by grassy drifts of red-bronze Carex buchananii. <p> Bold plants are the foundation of many of Gullickson 's favorite combinations, though he admits that using as many of them as he does can be tricky. " I love to play different textures and colors against each other, " he says, " and use a lot of plants you could probably call interesting rather than pretty. But if you use lots of what could otherwise be considered accent plants, they tend to look tight and contrived. It 's a matter of working with them in place. I do n't have qualms about using common plants, either, so the garden is a mix of the very common and the unusual. " <p> Gullickson counts among his successes the strappy foliage of Phormium tenax combined with golden grass( Arundinaria viridistriata), bright blue borage, and orange and yellow nasturtiums ; or nestled among purple trailing lantana, Carex ' Frosted Curls ', Euphorbia rigid, and Helichrysum petiolare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Another combination, located on the upper terrace near an attractive, adobe-colored obelisk and an elegant earthenware pot, consists of clouds of white Cerastium tomentosum offset by deep-green swaths of Algerian. ivy and the broad, orange-toothed tongues of Aloe camperi, whose edges and torches of tangerine-colored blossoms glow when backbit by the sun. <p> " People should think of garden plants not as additions to a house, but more like furniture, things that can be moved if you do n't like where they are, " Gullickson says. " A lot of my combinations just came -- instead of finding the right plant for the right spot, it was a matter of finding a spot in which I could put a plant I liked. But there has to be a dynamic tension between them, " he cautions. " There needs to be the play of form and shape and color to create a harmonious total from disparate plants. It takes a lot of rearranging when you get tired of something, and you can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composition. " Since Gullickson 's main interest is foliage texture, it means removing flowers that might be disruptive as well. This year, for instance, he removed a third of the aeoniums ' wands of pink blossoms to prevent them from overwhelming the beauty of the plants ' rosettes of foliage and the foliage of their associates.( Some people might recoil at this notion ; perhaps such cutting is easier to do if you like to bring flowers indoors, as these two do.) <p> Gullickson 's notions of harmony are primarily intuitive, he says, although he credits some of this to the fact that he grew up in Southern California in a gardening family who paid close attention to color and spatial relationships. His maternal grandparents were gardeners as well, so gardening was something that came to him early on. " One just did it, " he says matter-of-factly. His eventual entrance into nursery work was not at all surprising -- in 1973 he gave up graduate school to work for Kata Shi Landscape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years. From there, he has intermittently worked as a garden designer, caretaker, and teacher on his own between stints at Egger &; Son Nurseries in Marin County and at Magic Gardens in Berkeley. <p> " I love working in nurseries, " he says. " It 's a great way to keep in touch with who 's growing what and what 's new in plants, and because you 're dealing with so many people, it offers many clues to the cultural requirements of different plants in a particular region. It 's highly educational. " While Franken field admits to being more of the " maintainer than the designer, " his enthusiasm is equal to Gullickson 's, and he finds he ca n't wait to get out and work in the garden after being in a " hermetically sealed office " all day. <p> Another love Gullickson gained early on was for water and fish ponds, influenced largely by Japanese neighbors in Santa Barbara who also gardened and accepted gifts of goldfish whenever his had multiplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " he explains. " It 's like a fireplace, actually, in that it can pull your interest and be very mesmerizing. Basically this is an arid climate, but even in the hottest of weather, a little water is psychologically cooling, if not physically cooling. " <p> As a result, a stone 's throw from the lower terrace 's comfortable chairs, canvas umbrella, and assorted plants in containers -- such as the brilliant red-blossomed Canna ' Ambassador ' and the rare Canna ' Stuttgart ' with its variegated foliage -- is a small irregularly shaped pool with a thin waterfall. A golden-blossomed yellow water lily( Nymphaea ' Chromatella ') floats tranquilly in the two feet of water, along with a bushy stand of sweet flag( Acorus gramineus). Among their roots swim goldfish, a not-so-small catfish, and several of the largest you have ever seen in such a tiny pond.( The secret to huge koi, Frankenfield reveals, is to feed them a combination of fish food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pool 's inhabitants attract a majestic snowy egret, which likes to dine on the goldfish, as does the occasional, more prosaic raccoon. These visitors are endured with grace, particularly since they tend to catch only those fish that are too ill or old to escape. Birds, butterflies, and snakes are also encouraged. The only creature that is not tolerated is the snail. " Snails are our biggest problem, " Gullickson says. " Occasionally we put out snail bait, but mostly we handpick them because of the fish-pond and the drainage. Not using pesticides seems to pay off, because there are lots of critters in the garden. " The wildlife the garden attracts is augmented by the pair 's two dogs, Ben and Ramona ; Lionel the cat ; and some fanciful counterparts : plastic or ceramic lizards, crocodiles, and other animals, hidden among the plants or " roaming " about the terrace. " It 's fun to have people stumble across them, " Gullickson explains. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spiritual remnant of a ha-ha in England. " <p> Arching out over the edges of the pool are the broad leaves of a 12-year-old Gunnera tinctoria( also known as G. chilensis), which Gullickson kept in a 36-inch box until he was able to give it a permanent home here. The narrow, graceful foliage and habit of the uncommon Japanese bamboo Sasa tessellata appears nearby, and is echoed in form, but not in color, by the black bamboo( Phyllostachys nigra) on the terrace. Opposite the pool, the terrace takes-on a woodland effect, created in part by a large, shading box elder( Acer negundo), a relic of the previous tenants that helps soak up the water in the seep that forms at the bottom of the hill. The tree also tends to drop a lot of debris, but it has been much better about that ; Gullickson reports, since it was pollarded last year. <p> Beneath the elder are drifts of sharp-leaved acanthus, graceful ginger, Impatiens balfourii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have elbowed their way in to create their own combinations. Unexpected guests, such as the ferns and even buddleias, which appear in the garden even though there are n't any in the neighborhood, are allowed to stay as long as they behave and mix well with the other residents. <p> This degree of tolerance does not mean that a laissez-faire attitude is taken toward maintenance, however. Both owners spend hours in the garden, weeding, deadheading, moving plants to more desirable spots, and eradicating those that are no longer intriguing. They start most of the plants small, either from cuttings from friends ' gardens or from six-packs, then carefully tend them until they became established. Watering is done primarily by a low-volume drip irrigation and spray system divided into different zones. The center section, or mixed border, is fairly drought tolerant, so it is watered every two weeks or so, although the fountain of Miscanthus sinensis, Gullickson confesses, would probably prefer a more regular drinking schedule. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice a week to encourage a lusher look, although tropical might be a more accurate word to use. It is difficult to imagine anything lusher looking than the hillside beyond. <p> Once the bulk of the back garden was established, the industrious pair were able to devote their attention to a different design problem -- the top of the garage in front of the house. When they bought the property, the sunny area over the bunker like block of cement contained lawn, a few rosebushes, and a Magnolia xsoulangiana. Gradually the two started " eating away at the lawn " in an effort to create a larger planting area and thereby soften the imposing nature of the structure and the noise and distraction of the street. " We wanted it to look sort of tropical and exotic, but not outrageous, because we do n't spend as much time in front as we do in back, " Gullickson says. <p> Toward this end, Gullickson and Frankenfield planted five Brugmansia ' Charles Grimaldi ' to form a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bloom the perfume of their golden bells fill the neighborhood. Joining them is an unusual cast of characters including Chinese rice paper tree( Tetrapanaxpapyrifer), with broad, felted leaves and pleasantly peeling bark ; ' Iceberg ' rose and. Thalictrum rochebrunianum, both white ; Zea perens, a tall perennial corn with red stalks and tiny, beadlike kernels ; and an agaperes with long, arching stalks of orange, pendulous biossoms marked with brown that cascade enticingly over the edges of the garage. In order to incorporate water sounds here, Gullickson constructed a Japanese fountain out of an Asian stoneware bowl and sections of bamboo " rescued from an ancient cocktail lounge that was being demolished. " The umbrella like leaves of Darmera peltata appropriately grace the fountain. It relishes the moist soil, which tends to flood when it rains heavily. Because of this, part of the lawn will have to be lifted and the garage roof drilled to create better drainage, unthinkable if the garage had n't been " overbuilt by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here, Gullickson is toying with the idea of further reducing the lawn, perhaps replacing it with a multitextured, crazy-paved mosaic of tiles, bricks, and broken plates, studded with low-growing plants that require less water than tuff does. Once the screening plants fill in a little more, this also would make the space a more inviting place in which to take advantage of the rooming sun. <p> Otherwise, Gullickson generally is satisfied with the direction the garden has taken in a relatively short period of time. " Now that the bulk of the garden is in place, " he says, " or at least the structural plants that give it shape and dimension, I 'm liking it more and more. Early on there 's a tendency to want to be changing things all the time, but now I find that it 's very satisfying to just watch things grow and mature. I 've done lots of gardens for other people, and had them in places that I 've rented, but I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've lived in one place since I was a kid, and it 's nice to having something that is mine. It really is a refuge. " <p> In answer to the question, Refuge from what? Gullickson responds, " As much as we like the Bay area and all it has to offer, this is a counterpoint to urban living, an escape from the traffic and the noise and the hustle and bustle of the city. I think gardens for most people are a way of keeping in touch with the nonhuman world, with nature. It certainly is that for us. And it 's not like creating a piece of art that does n't change once it is completed. It 's a process that we are continually involved in.

She gardens in Santa Fe, New Mexico. <p> GULLICKSON 'S TOP 10 <p> The following are 10 of my favorite plants that I find interesting for their texture, color, and/or sculptural qualities. Notes on their culture are based on experience in our garden. -- KG. <p> Arundinaria viridistriata( USDA Zones 8-10 ; 2-3 ft.). A handsome running bamboo that spreads rapidly in our garden. To control spreading, plant in a large container sunk in the ground. Luminous, charreuse-to-yellow foliage with dark green stripes. Needs ample moisture and protection from midday sun. <p> Brugmansia ' Charles Grimaldi ' and B. ' Frosty Pink '( often ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide). Large trumpet-shaped flowers and wonderful evening perfume. Brugmansia ' Charles Grimaldi ' is very prolific and long-blooming with pendulous, gold-or saffron-colored flowers up to 10 inches. Fast growers, easily rooted from cuttings. May be pruned as trees or cascading shrubs. In cold climates, grow in large( at least 18-inch-diameter) containers and winter inside. <p> Canna ' Stuttgart '( Zones 8-10 ; 5-6 ft.). A canna recently introduced from the Brooklyn Botanical Garden. Gold, cream, and olive-green variegation. Has not bloomed for us yet, but with foliage like this, flowers are almost superfluous! Provide bright shade or protection from hot afternoon sun. <p> Carex morrowii ' Everbright '( USDA Zones 4-10 ; 12 in.). A durable perennial sedge that is evergreen in our climate. Graceful arching foliage with cream-colored margins. Excellent edging or accent plant that forms tufts of foliage up to 2 feet across. <p> Gunhera chilemis( Zones 8-10 ; 5-7 ft.). A huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet across ; dark green in color with prominent venation. Flowers carried on 2-to 3-foot club-shaped particles. Needs constantly moist( not-wet) soft and a sheltered location to protect from wind damage. If container grown, results will be disppointing if you use smaller than a 24-inch-diameter box. <p> Hedychium gardnerianum( Zone 10 ; 5-8 ft.). Bold and tropical-looking with 12-. to 18-inch-long, sword-shaped foliage about 4 to 6 inches wide arranged alternately. Reminiscent of a bottlebrush, the inflorescence is about one foot tall, 6 to 8 inches across, has golden petals and red stamens, and is usually long-lasting. Prefers evenly moist soft and a warm situation. Suitable for containers ; can be wintered in a greenhouse. <p> Melianthus major( Zones 9-10 ; 8-10 ft.). Deeply cut glaucous foliage and distinctive maroon flower stalks up to 3 feet long that appear in late winter and uncoil like fiddleheads. Exotic accent plant. Needs full sun and regular watering, but will tolerate some drought. Avoid fertilizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a palmlike effect, remove lower foliage to. expose the stems. Tip pruning produces masses of blue-gray foliage. <p> Otatea acuminata subsp. aztecorum( Zones.9-10 ; 8 ft.). One of the most gore of bamboos with tall, arching canes. Narrow, 3- to 6-inch medium green leaves carried in airy, pendulous clusters all along the stems. Keep foliage thinned for an elegant, fountainlike habit. Spreads rather slowly but like other bamboos, is probably best grown in a large container sunk in the ground. Likes light shade or dappled sun. Not fussy about soil, but will suffer from drought. Does best with regular watering. <p> Sparrmannia africana( Zones 9-10 ; 12 ft.). Large palmate or heart-shaped leaves 6 to 12 inches wide. Foliage bright green and fuzzy, even bristly, to the touch. " Older foliage often yellow with dark green venation. Clusters of 1-inch white flowers carried at the tips of the branches have showy, golden stamens tipped with maroon. A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year!) screen. Undemanding best with evenly moist( not wet) soft.and occasional fertilizing. Pinch or cut back to encourage full growth. Excellent container plant. <p> Tetrapanaxpapyrifer( Zone 10 ; 12 ft.). Dramatic plant with maple-shaped leaves 2 to 3 feet across. Araliaceous inflorescence forms antlerlike branching flower stalks spreading to 3 or 4 feet tall and wide above the foliage. Underside of foliage covered with whitish tomentum that makes the leaves shimmer at night when lit from below. Effective grown in clumps. Works well in a largish container. Not fussy( wants full to half sun) but is tender and likes regular watering. <p>
