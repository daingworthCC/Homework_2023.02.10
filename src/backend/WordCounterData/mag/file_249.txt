2030141 <p> The chief executives of Inc. 500 staffing and human resources companies know how to sustain growth by morphing their business when demand shifts from one sector of the economy to another. Thinknicity, founded in 1997, made a quick transition from IT talent-scouting to the biotech and pharmaceutical staffing markets. Contract Recruiting, based in Palos Verdes Estates, Calif., steered clear of doing business with dot-commers altogether, and CEO Ladd Richland claims his $4.8 million outsourced recruiting company is better off for it. Others are using new technologies to hard-wire their growth. Both TruStar Solutions, a recruiting company based in Fishers, Ind., and Unicru, a recruiter of hourly workers based in Beaverton, Oreg., employ artificial-intelligence technology to help them sift through huge volumes of resums. Unicru, which recruits for Blockbuster and Universal Studios, is rolling out its in-store recruiting kiosk that uses the new technology to screen prospective job applicants for open positions -- and can alert management to a hot prospect within minutes.

During that time, its digital systems have changed the way doctors store images of their patients ' hearts. Its software and Web-based programs also allow physicians to keep track of their notes, patient prescriptions, and patient allergies. It 's the Law : Hospitals are required to retain patient images for seven years. The Old Way : Before Heartlab, images made by X-ray machines and echocardiograms were typically stored on expensive workstations or 35mm film. Dream Team : CEO Robert Petrocelli, whose background is in physics and computer science, co-founded the company with cardiologist Dr. Jonathan Elion. They developed their imaging system in partnership with Hewlett-Packard 's medical division. Future Projects : Heartlab is working on a system that would allow doctors to instantly access a patient 's previously recorded heart image -- even if that image was stored at a distant hospital. Three-Year Goal : To reach $100 million in sales.

It has 424 franchise offices nationwide and in Canada, Japan, and Portugal that employ about 22,000 people. But the founders still run the original Omaha branch and recently opened another in Fremont, Nebr. Thank Granny : In another life, CEO Paul Hogan( no relation to the crocodile hunter, mate) was a high-ranking executive at Merry Maids, a cleaning service franchiser. He got the idea for Home Instead after his 89-year-old grandmother became unable to care for herself. " Even though she had 51 grandchildren and 50 great-grandchildren, it took all of us to help, " he says, recalling how he and his wife would drive her to the hairdresser and church. With the family 's care, Hogan 's grandmother lived to be over 100 years old. " I remember thinking, ' How do people with smaller families do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have franchise offices in three more countries, and a total of 600 to 650 franchisees. Progressive Medical af Westerville, Ohio 2002 Revenue : $38.8 million Growth( 1998-2002) : 326% No. 492 Founded : 1986 Employees : 108 <p> David Bianconi was working as the chief financial officer of a medical equipment company when he launched Progressive, a provider of workers ' compensation services to insurance underwriters and case managers. Trial Period : In 1989, Progressive was close to collapse. Bianconi quit the CFO job and gave himself four months to turn Progressive around. " I told myself, ' During this period I will not second-guess myself. Even if no one I call will speak to me, and I have no success, this is what I will be doing, regardless, ' " he recalls. After his four months were up, he 'd made enough progress to start drawing a small salary. Molding the Company : Bianconi hires people he likes whether he has a job opening or not. " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone that I think can really contribute, we will change the direction of our strategic plan.

Robbins 's younger brother, Bruce, a pitcher for the Detroit Tigers in the ' 70s, founded the company and is now chairman of the board. When the Heat Is On : The elder Robbins says athletic competitiveness drives TruStar. " When it gets harder or hotter, you push through the barriers, " he says. " Sports teaches you a tremendous respect for what a team can accomplish. " Sweet Spot : TruStar 's competitive advantage is its relationships with major online job boards. Monster.com, CareerBuilder.com, and Yahoo 's Hot Jobs pay it for postings. It 's also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winnow huge volumes of resums down to the top 5% to 10% of candidates. Management Style : LeRoy Robbins, who spent his early corporate career wading through big-company bureaucracy at giants like PepsiCo and 3M, says : " I am absolutely on fire making decisions. You can decide today and move today ; The Outsource Group bcfgh Walnut Creek, Calif. 2002 Revenue : $358.5 million Growth( 1998-2002) : 3,303% No. 35 Founded : 1997 Employees : 48 <p> This Inc. 500 star topped last year 's list with 54,330% growth. It 's a PEO( professional employer organization), though it 's now calling itself an EPO( employment process outsourcer). Either way, the company provides 50 different HR functions to more than 400 clients across the country. Kevin Grauman, the company 's CEO and founder, says TOG is continuing to grow rapidly despite struggling with its technology platform. Three years ago it shelled out around $1.5 million for client-server software -- a PeopleSoft-type system -- and earlier this year the headaches with upgrades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming beholden to this huge beast, " he says, noting that every time the software company made modifications he had to hire an army of consultants to come in and retrain his staff. So in early 2003, he decided his company would develop its own Web-based system. New Converts : Grauman says the recent scuffle between Oracle and PeopleSoft actually helps his case because it 's now easier to persuade big-name clients to convert to his company 's software. The new system, Emportal, is simple and intuitive, he says, and it requires no training. He plans to start selling it in late 2003 to clients with as many as 10,000 employees.

But he felt the company was sometimes inflexible and inefficient. In 1996, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lined up, he quit Hewitt with the idea of starting his own company. He later hired away some of Hewitt 's top managers. Today, Synhrgy provides full-service HR outsourcing to 18 of the largest corporations in America. Expensive Lesson : Never team up with a company whose corporate culture is wildly different from yours. Synhrgy 's partnership with a software giant went sour within 12 months, and Carlson had to buy all his stock back. " Now I tend to only partner with businesses that have a true entrepreneurial spirit, " he says.

Leap of Faith : In his first year Aspitz realized one Thursday that he had no money for Friday 's payroll. " I did n't sleep the whole night, " he says. On Friday, he gave his five staffers the bad news. " You just speak from your heart -- people resonate with that. " His did -- all remained and got paid the next week.

Somerville about integrity and perseverance. " When you say you 're going to do something, you 've got to do it. The Army pounded that into me, " he says. After the service, he went on his " one and only job interview " with a software company. Five years later he left that business to start his own venture making software for online corporate education and training. Out of Pocket : Somerville and four employee shareholders funded the company 's launch themselves. Bootstrapping " created a very different culture here, " he says. " We 're not a start-up anymore, but we still act like one -- and that 's a lot of fun. " Somerville says he has never lost a customer to another company.

On Line 1 : CEO Scott Fritz says the company 's top priority is customer service, and one way it shows it is that it does n't have voice mail. " When you 've got a name like ' Human Capital, ' you 've got to have a human answering the phone, " says Fritz. CPA Support : Fritz says one of the company 's biggest assets is its good reputation among CPAs. He works to set up alliance networks with major CPA firms, and once a handful of CPAs are on board, they refer all their clients to Human Capital. " I basically learned that business owners trust their CPAs above almost any other adviser, " he says.

Power to the People : Michael Robinson, a progressive ex-Wall Street exec originally from the British Caribbean, thinks his company will continue to grow quickly, but he 's steering away from major cities like Boston and Atlanta, where competitors have already saturated the markets, to smaller cities like Tampa, where his company has just opened a second office. Lesson Learned : A client once requested five " reasonably sane " individuals for a job the following day, and Robinson said, " Of course. "( " My, answer then was always ' of course, ' " he says.) But he called at least 60 people that afternoon, none of whom was available. Eager to please, Robinson sent three of his own employees to the job, and the client was not impressed.

CEO Dayne Williams considers the book Socratic Selling by Kevin Daley( which counsels asking questions to understand clients instead of pitching a product) to be a great tool. He also recommends the B-Alert plan offered in The Power of Focus by Jack Canfield. The plan has six steps : blueprint, action, learning, exercise, relaxation, think. Sports Center : Williams played fullback for the Florida State Seminoles from 1985-88( the Deion years), and former teammates sit on his board.

It now places approximately 3,000 employees a year at companies that include GE, General Dynamics, AmGen, and H.J. Heinz. By the Hour : Ladd says one of the company 's keys to success is charging an hourly fee for its work and not a placement fee. " We do n't believe in contingency fees, " he says.

ICON KEY TABLE Finicky Financing <p> A business plan may be brilliant, but getting start-up capital is still a challenge. As usual, the majority of this year 's Inc. 500 companies were launched using the founders ' personal assets, loans, or funds from friends and family. However, a few crafty Inc. 500 founders secured cash elsewhere. Some Asked the man upstairs.

And Dean Soil, president of SubZero Constructors( page 102), credits frequent-flier miles with getting his company off the ground. With no money to start his business, he turned in his miles for a first-class ticket to Atlanta, adopted a " think big, act big " attitude, and landed a $1 million contract with a large former client from a previous job.
