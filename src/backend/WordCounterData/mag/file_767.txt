4178441 of STAR TREK : DISCOVERY( Report) <h> Share : <p> We have n't heard much news about the upcoming new Star Trek series set to hit CBS All Access next summer, Star Trek : Discovery, since it was announced that Bryan Fuller had sadly stepped down as series showrunner. Well, turn that frown upside-down because this time the news is amazing : actress Michelle Yeoh, known best for her roles in films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and the Netflix series Marco Polo, has reportedly joined the cast in what is presumably the lead role( because I mean, c'm on : it 's Michelle Yeoh!). <p> The news actually came from Nicholas Meyer( via Coming Soon) who famously directed bothStar Trek II : The Wrath of Khan and Star Trek VI : The Undiscovered Country, and is serving as a consulting producer on Discovery. While promoting the new Blu-ray for his classic film Time After Time, he said " I know Michelle Yeoh is in it, " which is as straight from the horse 's mouth as it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more than likely the series ' lead, which had been previously described a female Lieutenant Commander who simply goes by the title " Number One. " <p>( Nerdist has reached out to CBS for comment but has not heard back at the time of publication -- we will update this post as more is confirmed.) <p> Discovery will be the first Trek series for whom the main character wo n't be the ship 's captain. Of course, it is also possible that Yeoh could be playing the Captain of the Discovery, which would make here the first female Captain on a Star Trek series since Voyager ended back in 2001. In any event, Yeoh will be the first Asian lead in a Star Trek show. <p> Although he wo n't be the series showrunner anymore, Star Trek : Discovery is still being executive produced by Bryan Fuller, along with Gretchen Berg, Aaron Harberts, and Academy Award winner( and writer of Batman &amp; Robin, let 's not forget) Akiva Goldsman. Originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has now been delayed until summer of next year. <p> Are you as excited about Yeoh 's casting as we are? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.
