4022641 Appaloosa Ed Harris, Viggo Mortensen, Rene Zellweger R 3 stars CRITIC 'S CHOICE WESTERN Westerns may have gone the way of the Old West -- showing up at multiplexes about as frequently as brass spittoons at a saloon these days -- but the entertaining Appaloosa makes an excellent case that there 's plenty of spark left in the genre. Set in 1882, the film stars Harris( who cowrote and directed) as an itinerant, gunslinging lawman. He 's hired, along with his trusty deputy( Mortensen), to stop a murderous local rancher( Jeremy Irons, doing a live-action version of his snide Scar from The Lion King) in Appaloosa, a town in the New Mexico territories. When a fetching widow( Zellweger) comes to the burg, the bachelor marshal considers putting down roots. Appaloosa has all the standard elements of a western( shoot-outs, horses and open spaces), but what makes it so pleasurable is its concentration on character. There 's caring effort, in the sharp writing and acting, to make sure we fully understand each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads are effective, with a lean, squinty-eyed Mortensen in particular showing yet again what a magnetic, underrated star he is. Ghost Town Ricky Gervais, Greg Kinnear, Ta Leoni PG-13 2 stars COMEDY The ghosts of previous romantic comedies float through this one, but it 's still fun. Gervais, the lumpy-faced English comedian who co-created and starred in the original BBC version of TV 's The Office, plays a morose Manhattan dentist who finds, after a near-death experience, that he can see dead people -- and they in turn can see, and pester, him. One of these ghosts, a bon vivant in a tuxedo( Kinnear), is a philanderer who wants Gervais 's help to break up his widow 's( Leoni) betrothal. Predictably, the dentist falls for her himself. Gervais shows he can carry a movie here, while Kinnear and Leoni add pep and sex appeal. The Duchess Keira Knightley, Ralph Fiennes, Dominic Cooper PG-13 3 stars HISTORICAL A titled young Englishwoman is married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she bear him a male heir. She soon charms the nation with her looks, style and wit, but her dour husband lavishes more affection on his dogs -- and other women -- than on her. Sound familiar? The parallels between the lives of Georgiana Spencer( Knightley), the 18th-century Duchess of Devonshire, and Diana Spencer, the Princess of Wales( and Georgiana 's great-great-great-great niece), serve as pointed subtext in this lush biopic. Based on Amanda Foreman 's 1998 biography, Duchess races through Georgiana 's life story, hitting the high spots but neglecting to fully flesh out this fascinating woman. Knightley acquits herself admirably but does much of her acting with her eyebrows. Fiennes is superb as her fuddy-duddy hubby, locating the sympathetic soft spots within his boorish brute.
