2021441 WHO CAN BLAME investors for wanting to flush 1994 down the memory hole, to borrow a disagreeable phrase from Orwell 's 1984? Measured by the performance of the major stock markets, the year was a thorough downer : The Big Board slipped 5.9%, Nasdaq dropped 7.4%, and the American Stock Exchange fell no less than 11.8%. Against that grim backdrop, scores of individual stocks stand out -- for better and for worse. The lists on these pages rank the top 100 and bottom 20 performers on the major markets by total return -- price changes plus dividends -- through December 9.( Lists omitted) Compiled with the help of Barra, a Berkeley investment research firm, the lists exclude partnership units, closed-end mutual funds, REITs, preferred stock, IPOs, spinoffs, ADRs, and shares that began the year trading at less than $5 each, before splits. Six( count " em) interest-rate hikes by the Federal Reserve did n't prevent some companies from doing their shareholders proud, but the monetary turbulence took its toll : Qualifying for 1994 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, less than half the 88% required in 1993. Says Salomon Brothers strategist Marc Usem : " 1994 was a stock picker 's kind of market. " The happiest pickers were investors in EXX, a Las Vegas maker of small toys and electric motors, formerly called SFM, whose stock blew away the rest of the field with a 1,269% return on the Amex. That 's no surprise : EXX holds a toy license for Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, the hottest TV superheroes in town. Superior earnings powered many technology stocks onto the 1994 list. MicroTouch Systems, which makes computer screens that respond to a finger 's touch, ranked first on Nasdaq, with a 447% return. Give partial credit to IBM 's decision to offer the screens as an option on some of its PC monitors. Robust demand for sophisticated chips pushed semiconductor maker LSI Logic to No. 2 on the NYSE list with a 158% return. Not all the best performers posted remarkable earnings. The resurgence of mergers in 1994 accounted for United Inns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. In November, privately held Harvey Hotel Co. offered $25 a share for United, which has lost money in each of its last eight fiscal years. Harvey plans to spend at least $40 million to renovate the Memphis company 's 25 hotels. Five of 1993 's winners grabbed the gold ring again in 1994 : Micron Technology and Robert Half International on the NYSE ; Cellular Communications International on Nasdaq ; Rogers and Blount on the Amex. Blount, in Montgomery, Alabama, makes chains for power saws, timber-harvesting equipment, and ammunition. Among the poor performers, specialty retailer Bombay had the uncomfortable distinction of ranking third worst on the NYSE just two years after having been the best performer on the Amex. The Fort Worth company drastically scaled back the number of country furniture stores it planned to open. Crash-plagued USAir Group spun onto the list of the NYSE 's worst performers. The airline is trying to stanch its losses by getting concessions from employees ; no agreement is expected soon. Greyhound, meanwhile, turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus line is struggling to compete with low-cost airlines and has been dogged by management problems( see Managing). Will investors remember 1995 more fondly than 1994? Do n't bet on it. With signs abounding that the economy is still strong, the Fed could keep raising rates -- bad news for stocks. A number of experts think there 's a correction in the offing : By several measures, such as the pallid 2.9% annual dividend yield of the S &P; 500, stocks are overvalued. It may prove another year for the stock pickers. <p>
