2034341 Section : PREVENTION PICKS We do n't just recommend natural remedies-we use them! Here, Prevention editors share their favorite cures for annoying problems <p> We 're a pretty healthy bunch here at Prevention. But even we get sick sometimes. When that happens, I often get asked for a drug-free remedy. <p> It could be my homemade echinacea tincture or bad-tasting boneset tea for colds, homeopathic arnica for bruises, or magnets for pain. I even have aromatherapy sprays that put your bad karma on the back burner. <p> But I 'm not the only staffer who plays doctor. Everyone here does! So as we head into another stress-filled holiday season, I 've asked my colleagues to share their favorite healing secrets. Here 's what they came up with. Do n't Stress-Swing! <p> " Swing dancing is my ticket to heaven, " says Editor-in-Chief Catherine Cassidy. As a single mother to two little girls and the fearless leader of Prevention 's editorial team, getting a quick dose of calm helps keep her life balanced. <p> Catherine takes swing dancing lessons from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have him come right to my house for lessons for a few reasons. It eliminates any excuse I might have for not getting to class, and I can work my schedule around the classes. Best of all, dancing is something my favorite guy and I can do together. " <p> Swing dancing functions both as a stress reliever and a fitness booster. In an hour-long session, you can expect to burn about 375 calories( based on a 150-lb person). And there 's an added bonus, Catherine reports : " At weddings, dinners, and especially holiday parties-anywhere there 's music with the right beat-we get to show our stuff! " Sari Reaches for Herbs <p> Sari Harrar, Prevention 's health news editor, relies on herbs to ease several common ailments-remedies she learned as coauthor of The Woman 's Book of Healing Herbs( Rodale Press, Inc., 1998). " Goldenseal plus echinacea works as well as antibiotics for clearing up my stubborn sinus infections, " says Sari. She uses a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of goldenseal tincture four times a day until the infection clears up. <p> " I also find that yellow dock tincture and evening primrose oil prevent outbreaks of acne. " To keep her skin clear, Sari takes a teaspoon of yellow dock tincture in a little water twice a day and takes 3,000 mg of evening primrose oil daily. Herbalists suggest that yellow dock may help clear up chronic skin problems ; evening primrose is recommended for inflammatory conditions such as acne. <p> When she travels, Sari makes up a jug of valerian tea so that she can sleep through the night. She places 2 tablespoons of dried valerian in a large tea ball with as many cloves and pieces of cinnamon bark as she can cram in( valerian has a distinctive unpleasant aroma, which cinnamon and cloves help mask). Place the tea ball in a Thermos, cover with 16 oz of boiling water, and steep, covered, for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the tea ball, and sip as needed. Relax, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logs traveling from one event to another, Food Editor Regina Ragone often comes home exhausted. " When I am so bone weary that I feel like I 'm bound to get sick, I get a hot stone massage. " <p> A what? <p> Hot stone massages are the hot new bodywork craze-and for very good reason : They 're one of the most blissfully relaxing experiences imaginable. According to Regina, who goes to the Stone Spa in New York City, you lie on a table while the therapist massages you with hot oil. Then he places smooth, heated lava rocks on the points of your body that have just been massaged. " The rocks feel like warm extensions of the therapist 's hands, which help to loosen really tight muscles. My favorite part is when he places small, warm pebbles between your toes, " adds Regina. Though no clinical trials have as yet confirmed the benefits of hot stone massage, regular massage is a well-studied stress buster and muscle relaxer. Stretching Nixes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simple way to ease the pain of a sore shoulder. <p> " About 7 years ago, I pulled something in my left shoulder while shoveling snow. Though it mostly got better on its own, my shoulder still hurts whenever I lift anything heavy. Rodale 's Health Promotion Manager, Budd Coates, recommended this exercise. I do it in a hot shower, and it works like a charm! " <p> Reach your left arm behind you diagonally, and grab your left wrist with your right hand at about butt level. Pull down on your left arm, gently but firmly. Repeat a few times. Switch arms if your right shoulder 's the one that hurts. Chamomile Eases Denise to Sleep <p> As the features editor, Denise Foley can tell you something about stress. By day, she balances a calendar 's worth of deadlines, runs a busy household complete with husband, teenage son, and three dogs, and is a master gardener and community volunteer on the side. By night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me relax and get a better night 's sleep. In fact, it relaxes me so much that I ca n't drink it during the day. I love the fragrance and flavor too. " Use either very aromatic chamomile tea bags, and brew, covered, for 10 minutes, or use 1 teaspoon of fragrant dried chamomile flowers per cup, then brew as above. Kava KOs Michele 's Flying Fear <p> Fitness Editor Michele Stanten is n't afraid of much : not blistering 60-mile walks or a midnight hike in grizzly country. But put her in a plane, and she admits to a super case of nerves. <p> " My cure for airplane anxiety is the herb kava, " says Michele. " It calms me down and even helps me get a little rest while I 'm in the air. " Kava is a time-tested herbal anxiety remedy used for centuries as a ceremonial beverage in various South Seas islands. <p> Just before she leaves for the airport, Michele takes two 150-mg capsules of kava @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still jittery at takeoff time, she pops one more. Holly 's Headache Cure <p> Nutrition Editor Holly McCord does n't get headaches often, but when she does, they 're doozies. She uses this little trick to make the pain disappear. <p> " This sounds a little crazy, but it really works for me. When a headache comes along, I just press the bones around my eyes and near my temples. When I do that, I can usually locate some incredible sore spots. Once I find them, I hold the pressure for about 10 seconds, which is about as long as I can stand it. I 'm not sure why this works, but it 's absolutely amazing how the pain goes away, " says Holly. Sharon 's Shotgun Cold Cure <p> " Because I have asthma, it 's crucial that I knock out a cold in its earliest stages, " says Sharon Faelten, managing editor for Prevention Health Books. " This recipe seems to do the trick every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cold. " <p> Here 's Sharon 's recipe : <p> " First, I have a cup of Celestial Seasonings Echinacea Cold Season Herb Tea.( In addition to echinacea, a proven cold-fighting herb, the tea also contains vitamin C, zinc, licorice root, eucalyptus, and peppermint.) After work, I go straight home and climb into bed with a steaming mug of chicken soup, fortified with 3 cloves of fresh-chopped garlic and 1/2 teaspoon of red-pepper flakes or a chopped chile pepper. As soon as I finish the soup, I take a 500-mg tablet of vitamin C and suck on a zinc lozenge. Half an hour later, I have another cup of tea, followed by a big glass of water. Then I go right to sleep. Usually, my symptoms are gone by morning. If not, I continue to take zinc, vitamin C, and echinacea tea a couple of times during the day. " The Alt Med Editor 's Favorite <p> As Prevention 's alternative medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around here comes down with a cold. My absolute favorite cold remedy is a combination of boneset tea and echinacea tincture. It seems to work on nearly everyone who tries it. I have to admit, though, the horrible taste of this tea will knock your socks off, and there 's nothing you can do to improve it. But even the die-hard herbal medicine nonbelievers here swear by it, once they 're finished swearing at me for making them drink the stuff. Make this potion at the very first sign of a cold. <p> Take 3 tablespoons of dried boneset, and pour about 24 oz of boiled water over it. Add 1 tablespoon of echinacea tincture. Steep, covered, for 15 to 20 minutes, then strain and drink. I like to use a French coffee press to make the tea. Sip all of the tea, slowly, over the next few hours. Most people report feeling better within hours. Susan 's Poison Ivy Eraser <p> Deputy Editor Susan Flagg Godbey had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood. <p> " For bad poison ivy rashes, my dad would gather catnip leaves, roll them up, and dab the juice directly on the blisters. We 'd do this several times a day. It relieved the itching significantly and dried the rash faster than letting nature take its ugly course. This was in the ' 50s, when cortisone creams were n't readily available. Calamine lotion was all we had, and we hated wearing that chalky pink lotion. Besides, it never seemed to work, anyway. " <p>( Note : We checked Susan 's remedy with London- and Washington, DC-based herbalist Douglas Schar, DipPhyt, MCPP. " Just might work, " says Schar, " because catnip contains anti-inflammatory properties. But make sure you use the correct catnip species, Nepeta cataria.
