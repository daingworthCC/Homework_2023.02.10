4155341 editor 's note # For me, 2012 will go down in history as the year I grew my first awesome vegetable garden. As I write this letter, a corner of my backyard is already alive and kicking with young cornstalks, five kinds of tomatoes, four kinds of greens, bush beans, squash, eggplant, herbs, and more. By the time you read this letter, many of my homegrown goodies will be ripe for the picking. # This year 's garden success( as compared to last year 's ramshackle results) is due in part to the advice of Grow Cook Eat author Willi Galloway, who wrote a goof-proof kitchen garden primer for VT 's April/May issue. Since then, Galloway has been supplying VT readers( and me) with a weekly booster shot of advice and inspiration on the vegetariantimes.com blog. # Now it 's time to cook. This issue is loaded with recipes designed to make the most of your summer harvest--whether it 's home-grown, picked fresh from the farmers ' market, or a combination of both. In 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 56) we 've got ideas for one of the season 's most perfect foods. " Hot Hues, Cool Dinners "( p. 32) serves up magnificent main-dish salad recipes, and " Pizza on the Grill "( p. 62) shows how easy it is to make veggie-centric pizzas outdoors. # You 'll also find new ways to preserve summer flavors for the cooler months ahead. " Freeze! "( p. 40) offers tasty recipes such as summer tomato soup and basil-walnut pesto that you can enjoy today, then stash in ice trays for future single-serving ease. " Queens of Canning "( p. 70) introduces three women who have mastered the art of delicious no-fuss pickles, preserves, and other food in jars. Tops on my list is Marisa McClellan 's super simple recipe for canned plum tomatoes( p. 76). Armed with this recipe and a backyard full of tomatoes, I wo n't have to buy a can of tomatoes until sometime in 2013. #
