4154941 NEWSVIEW # EYE ON ECOLOGY # In recent years, ecotourism has become a hot buzzword for environmentally minded travelers, but the World Society for the Protection of Animals, New York, advises tourists to research visitor attractions to ensure they are operating responsibly, keeping in mind the welfare of animals and the environment, and to avoid those that simply are green-washing. # Elizabeth Hogan, Oceans and Wild life Campaigns manager at WSPA, has put together a list of five tips that can help individuals identify when an ecotourist attraction is not as animal or environmentally friendly as it claims : # Avoid direct interaction with the animals. As a general rule, you should not be touching animals at an ecotourist attraction. Whether it is swimming with dolphins or holding sea turtles, this kind of contact with hundreds or thousands of tourists can traumatize the very animals being protected and compromise their health--and yours--sometimes in serious ways. # If there is a high entertainment to science ratio, stay away. Ecotourist attractions must balance science and entertainment. If the attraction you are considering has too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial ponds, it may not be paying enough attention to the welfare of the animals it supposedly is protecting and the science of conservation. # Do not eat any of the animals supposedly being protected. Done properly, there is nothing wrong with animal farming, but it is a very different thing than conservation. Any ecotourist attraction that tries to balance conservation of a species with selling it for meat is caught in a conflict of interest. Again, using turtles as an example, some farms claim to be helping endangered sea turtles while simultaneously selling their meat to local restaurants. # Look for what others have to say. Before you visit an attraction, spend a few minutes on the Internet to see what third-party groups have reported. # Ask your travel agent and cruise line and hotel concierge plenty of questions. With the four points above in mind, come armed with questions for anyone recommending you visit an ecotourist attraction. Ask members of the travel industry to investigate the attractions they are promoting and provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the environments interest at their core. If they can not answer all of your concerns, look for other animal- and ecofriendly options. # " People want to do the right thing and ecotourism sounds good ; it feels good ; and people like the idea that they are helping make the world a better place while they are on vacation, but it 's not that simple. If you know what to look for, ifs fairly easy to spot problem places even if no one tells you, " advises Hogan. #
