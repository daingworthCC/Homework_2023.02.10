4105141 Seven leading garden designers divulge their tried-and-true favorites. <p> At this time of year, every plant seems like a good idea. Spring is seeded with hope -- and fed by optimistic catalog descriptions and growers ' hyperbole. Eventually, though, reality sets in, when many of the latest, newest, rarest specimens turn out to be fair-weather friends. Fact is, a garden 's success depends not on fleeting extroverts, but on steady, reliable performers. You could say the same of landscape designers. So we asked some of the best to reveal their top, time-tested picks. Here are the plants they turn to again and again and again. <p> Oakleaf hydrangea( Hydrangea quercifolia) <p> Zones 5-9 " One of the easiest, showiest, most useful perennials, this hydrangea boasts bold foliage that turns maroon in the fall, as the huge flower clusters fade to pink. It 'll also tolerate dryish shade and thrives in just about any climate. " <p> -- David McMullin, Atlanta <p> Cherry laurel( Prunus laurocerasus ' Otto Luyken ') <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lush shrub can handle a little shade, and its white spring blooms turn a gorgeous yellow by summer. " <p> -- Jon Carloftis, Erwinna, Pennsylvania <p> Flower Carpet rose( Rosa ' Noatraum ') <p> Zones 5-10 " No matter what soil you plant it in, this glamorous -- and disease-resistant -- ground cover rewards you with tons of roses two to three times a year. " <p> -- Jamie Durie, Los Angeles <p> Ostrich fern( Matteucci struthiopteris) <p> Zones 3-8 " These dramatic plume-shaped fronds reach heights of three to six feet and naturalize easily.

" <p> -- Julie Moir Messervy, Saxtons River, Vermont <p> Pink flowering currant( Ribes sanguineum var. glutinosum ' Claremont ') <p> Zones 6-8 " Shade- and drought-tolerant, this California native delivers dark-green leaves, clusters of rosy-pink blossoms -- and almost no maintenance! " <p> -- Katey Mulligan, San Francisco <p> Sweet-potato vine( Ipomoea batatas ' Blackie ' and ' Margarita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape designers would never admit it, but I love this common annual! It grows like a weed and covers all the flaws in a perennial bed. " <p> -- Rebecca Cole, New York City <p> Black bugbane( Actaea simplex ' Brunette ') <p> Zones 4-8 " Black bugbane has wonderful burgundy foliage ; three-foot-tall, cream-and-pink flowers that fill the garden with an intoxicating scent in late summer ; plus, it 's deer-proof. All in all, a great plant to mass.
