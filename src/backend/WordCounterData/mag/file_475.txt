4083741 WHEN EMINEM HIT the stage at Detroit 's Comerica Park on September 2nd - the MCs first hometown gig since 2005 - he had fans bouncing so hard that the stadium was literally shaking. " I was in the dressing room, and the vents were rattling, " says rapper B.o.B, who warmed up the sold-out, 42,000-person crowd on the opening night of Eminem and Jay-Z 's two-night Detroit stand. " I 've never seen a show this big - it was like the Woodstock of hip-hop. " As of press time, the Home and Home Tour - which was set to take over New York 's Yankee Stadium on September 13th and 14th - was on track to draw almost 200,000 fans and gross more than $15 million. " These are the two marquee guys in hip-hop, " says Rick Frank of Live Nation, who promoted the gigs. He says that the tickets sold out in less than an hour. " It 's like seeing Billy and Elton when they got together. " The success of the shows caps a huge comeback year for Eminem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 2.4 million copies and spawned two Number One singles : " Love the Way You Lie " and " Not Afraid. " Planning for the shows started at least four months ago, with Eminem and Jay-Z personally getting involved in the production details. The massive stage - centered around a 300-foot-wide HD video screen - required more than 50 semitrailers to transport from Detroit to New York, and it took 300 workers and six days to erect at Comerica Park. Stadium spectacles have traditionally been the domain of superstar rock &; roll acts like U2 and the Rolling Stones. But Kanye West, Jay-Z and now the Home and Home Tour have proved that hip-hop is maturing into an arena-friendly genre. " It took a long time for us to get where we are as performers, " Jay-Z told Rolling Stone last year. " Now we 're taking pride in showmanship. " Both rappers filled their sets with huge hits and big-name cameos. In Detroit, Jay-Z went first, bringing out Young Jeezy for four tracks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ai n't a Thang " up to his current single, " Young Forever. " Eminem made a dramatic entrance, rising in a cloud of smoke from a hole in the stage. " Goddamn it, Detroit, I 'm back! " he yelled. " Did you miss me, or what? " Backed for the first time by a live band, the MC tore through smashes like " The Real Slim Shady, " " Stan " and " Love the Way You Lie. " Eminem 's guest list included B.o.B, Drake and, in the night 's highlight, Dr. Dre and 50 Cent. " Em called me before the show and told me he was going to bring Dre out, " says 50. " I knew it was going to be a celebrated moment in hip -hop to have the three of us on the same stage. " Dre popped up during " My Name Is, " then whipped the crowd into a frenzy with his 1993 classic " Nuthin ' but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dogg 's parts.) " I was watching from the upper level with my friends, drinking some white wine, " says Drake, who 'd performed " Forever " earlier in the evening. " I had a smile on my face. I was just a fan that night. " With such massive momentum, will Em and Jay take their dual-headlining show on the road? " They could tour across every continent and have tremendous success, " says Live Nation 's Frank. " But there 's a certain mystique that comes with having only these shows. Right now, this is a once-in-a-lifetime moment. "
