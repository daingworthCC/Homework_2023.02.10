4110741 GOOD NEWS <p> What the Pill Can Do for Your Period <p> It has amazing powers beyondpreventing pregnancy. <p> The amount of blood you lose is cut down a lot. The artificial hormones in oral contraceptives prevent the uterine lining from thickening as it normally would during your cycle, and as a result, there 's very little blood to shed. <p> Your cramps are less intense. This is a consequence of having a much lighter flow : Your system does n't need to produce the natural cramp-causing chemicals that help release the uterine lining because there 's not much of a lining to slough off. <p> You can delay your flow. You can postpone it for three months, so you have only four periods a year, by going on a brand of the Pill called Seasonique. Another brand, Lybrel, gives you just one period a year. <p> SOURCE : AUDREY KOH, AN OB-GYN IN SAN FRANCISCO <p> Q &; A <p> " My vagina becomes ultrasensitive after I have an orgasm. Is this normal? " <p> Absolutely. Part of the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in blood flow to your private parts( especially your clitoris and the area surrounding it) as you build up to climax. Then, as your O winds down, it takes several minutes for that additional blood to start flowing back to the rest of your body. This can leave the area incredibly sensitive, to the point where you might not be able to handle having it touched, explains Linda Cho, an obstetrician and gynecologist in New York City. Once your down-below blood flow returns to normal, however, the extra sensitivity should subside. If it does n't, check in with your gyno ; you could be mistaking an infection for normal sensitivity. <p> ALERT! <p> Your Sexual Health Is Being Threatened -- Again <p> Last year was a mixed one for reproductive rights. Lawmakers expanded preventative-care coverage for women under the Affordable Care Act. Yet some strict state and national laws were proposed that, if passed, could block your access to birth control and abortion.
