4178541 <p> The back story : A glass of wine as an expression of patriotic pride? It might seem like a stretch, but that 's the concept behind Purple Heart, a new label from California-based C. Mondavi &amp; Family winemakers. The idea was borne from the company 's longtime support of military charities, which itself stemmed from the fact that company patriarch, the late Peter Mondavi, Sr., was a World War II veteran. " We were looking for a way to take our support to the next level, " says Paul Englert, a Mondavi vice president. The result : C. Mondavi partnered with the Purple Heart Foundation, which funds a variety of veterans programs, on creating a Purple Heart-themed wine, tying the vino to one of the nation 's highest military honors. C. Mondavi will contribute $10,000 to $50,000 annually to the foundation, depending on the wine 's sales. <p> As for the wine, it 's sourced from Napa Valley and is a Bourdeaux-style blend, heavy on the Merlot with a little Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very approachable : C. Mondavi execs figure the bottle will draw interest from sophisticated and casual sippers alike, so they did n't want to push the boundaries of complexity. " We wanted a wine that would be a crowd-pleaser, " says Englert, who notes that 7,500 cases of the wine were produced in this inaugural year of its release. By next year, he anticipates that will double to 15,000. " It 's doing well in the marketplace, " Englert adds. <h> James McAvoy on the future of the ' X-Men ' <p>( 2:18) <p> " X-Men : Apocalypse " star James McAvoy talks to WSJ+ members about the history of the " X-Men " --and what it would take to get him to keep playing Professor X in the movie franchise. <p> What we think about it : This is a solid $20 California red -- juicy in all the right ways and easy to drink. You get a lot of red and black fruit with just a taste of salt and spice( the winemakers say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> How to enjoy it : Because it 's not as big and bold as many other California reds, Purple Heart has a little more flexibility pairing-wise -- meaning you do n't have to think just in terms of steak. Englert says that " a sweet spot for this wine might be barbecue. " Especially a Memorial Day barbecue, we might add. <h> Mortgage Rates <p> Powered by <p> This advertisement is provided by Bankrate, which compiles rate data from more than 4,800 financial institutions.
