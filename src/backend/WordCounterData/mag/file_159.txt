2019441 Section : COUP DOCUMENT <p> I first learned about the coup against Mikhail Gorbachev around midnight, Sunday, August 18. My wife and I had just finished watching the Mel Gibson version of Hamlet on videotape, and had CNN on in the background while we rewound the tape. With the image of the body-strewn Danish court still fresh in our minds, we were startled to hear that an equally dramatic upheaval had just taken place in the Kremlin. <p> I knew that a hardline takeover in Moscow posed a direct threat to the pro-independence Latvian government in Riga. After confirming the seriousness of the developments with Paul Goble, Baltic Desk Officer for the State Department, I jumped in my car and headed for the Legation of Latvia in northwest Washington to see if I could establish contact with Riga. <p> Even under the best of conditions, phone communications with Latvia have always been difficult, and as I expected, all international lines to Riga were busy. The Latvian Foreign Ministry had recently acquired a cellular phone which could be reached by direct-dialing a Stockholm area code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, our most reliable form of communication with Riga had been by telex, and by 4:30 a.m. -- I had sent a series of telexes to the Foreign Ministry, the parliament press center, the daily newspaper Diena, and the Latvian news agency LETA. I informed them that I was at the Legation ready to receive and distribute any news they had on developments. I received my first response about one hour later, at 5:36 a.m. <p> I spent the next three days and nights at the Legation, logging in telex messages, faxing out reports to the State Department and the press, and telexing reports of reactions in the West back to my contacts in Riga. By the second day of the coup, after TV, radio, and telephone lines had been cut in Riga, the only way to get news into or out of Latvia was by telex. Soon the Latvian government telex machines began shutting down one by one, yet the messages kept coming, as enterprising staffers at the Foreign Ministry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city. <p> All the details of what took place in Riga during the Kremlin coup still need to be sorted out, but the telex messages that streamed into the Latvian Legation in Washington during those three days tell a dramatic story in themselves. They were written by courageous people under great stress, in a city under siege. With each report of another Black Beret( OMON) attack on a government building, the circle grew tighter around my correspondents in Riga. For me, the most difficult part of the three days was waiting for the next telex. Because I knew that if it did n't come, my contacts, friends I had known and worked with for many years, had joined the list of victims. Thankfully, that was one report I never had to receive. <p> Following, in chronological order, are translations of the telex messages that the Latvian Legation received from Riga during that period. Each new message begins with the time it was received in Washington. Senders have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner : TABLE Monday, August 19,1991 05:36 EST : For the time being all is calm in Riga.
