2019841 Section : ON THE HOME FRONT <p> Dateline : WASHINGTON, D.C. <p> -- On an easy Friday afternoon in late July, a group of senior Administration aides was sitting in the White House Mess having lunch when the word filtered through : Justice William J. Brennan was resigning from the Supreme Court. The reaction at the table was virtually uniform. " Oh, s --, " said one. <p> In a few hours these same men would go into high gear, so that by Monday morning George Bush could announce that his choice to replace Brennan was David Souter, whose approval seems all but, certain and who will probably turn out to be the strict constructionist the President says he is, with the potential to shift the High Court decisively to the right. But the episode in the Mess was revealing. Instinct told these people that this event was a predicament, not an opportunity. <p> Small in itself, the incident nonetheless illustrates the tremendous disparity between the Bush approach and that of his predecessor. Whereas the Reagan people arrived in Washington with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush people see themselves as professionals, managers unencumbered by ideology. Consequently, President Bush does not hit the rhetorical high notes that Reagan did( his " Read my lips " speech being the notable exception), which in turn means conservatives are reluctant to give him credit even when he does the right thing. <p> Not that all the differences between Reagan and Bush are to the Gipper 's advantage. With a 70 per cent approval rating and 12 sustained vetoes, Bush enjoys broader support than Reagan ever did, and this extends to communities, such as blacks, where Reagan never could. This difference in approach also means that conservatives and Bushites often argue past each other : while the former see an Administration heading for the rocks -- at least before Saddam Hussein 's Kuwaiti Anschluss -- the White House can point to record popularity, every veto upheld in Congress, and, now, a superb handling of the gravest foreign-policy challenge Bush has faced. The question is what this approval means, whether it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Reagan was successful because he was not a member of the governing establishment when he came into office, and he was not a member when he left office, " says Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, whose just-released tax package was designed in part to get the President back on track. " George Bush is a member of that governing establishment, and his success will be to change that system. The next sixty days will be crucial in determining whether Bush will govern with the American people and coercing the Left or with the Left coercing the people. " <p> Even conservatives acknowledge that Bush is more alert, more accessible, and more informed than Reagan ever was. Much as they hate the word, they concede too that the Bush Administration technically is more competent. Because this technical efficiency is not tied to any specific goal save that of staying in office, however, Bush has gained himself any number of temporary allies but very few disciples. This in turn means that on issues such as abortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Reagan, not only does he get zero credit, he is denounced as an opportunist. Bipartisan Dangers <p> HIS COMMITMENT to the Bipartisan Presidency is an even more serious liability. Far from making things easier for him in Congress, Bush 's outreach has only made him more subject to its whims. In a Wall Street Journal article this summer, Fred Barnes compared Bush 's strategy to the Nixon approach of selective endorsement of the opposition 's themes, arguing that the price of stealing some of the issues from the Democrats has been " a moderate-to-conservative President, but liberal government. " <p> To be sure, Bush has curbed the Democrats ' grosser excesses by using the veto to great effect, certainly to greater effect than Reagan, who huffed and puffed but usually signed in the end. Bush 's 12 vetoes have been on issues ranging from visas for Chinese students, to Medicaid funding for abortion, to minimum-wage increases. But while Bush has won the pitched battles, the vetoes are a sign that Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that the most apt comparison is with Gerald Ford, a nice man who ended up forced to resort to the veto a record number of times. " Because congressional leaders did n't know where he would draw the line they were constantly probing and prodding until they found they 'd crossed it, " says Keene. <p> There are other indications of the degree to which the agenda is set by Congress. In the past 18 months, there have been bills on minimum wage, child care, disabled rights, civil rights, clean air, etc. ; capital gains, a Bush priority, is not even on the docket. Further, the White House 's courting of Democrats -- e.g., John Sununu 's direct negotiations with Teddy Kennedy on civil-rights language -- rankles with Republican lawmakers on the Hill. It also spurs the Democrats to push for more than they ever would have dared with Reagan. " The Democrats are more militant when they negotiate these days, " says one Senate staffer. " They know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said his goal is to be kinder and gentler. " <p> Because Reagan never played that game he was without that particular liability, and even when surrendering a lot of ground he never surrendered the argument. In fact, his rhetorical fidelity to his principles gave him more flexibility than Bush, because it allowed him to compromise while holding onto his base. It 's hard to imagine, for example, Congress coming out to the right of Reagan on China, if only because he would intuitively have understood the need to have a few Chinese students over to the Rose Garden to show where his sympathies lay. On taxes, too, Reagan probably could have gotten away with Bush 's infamous June 26 press release. Beltway wisdom attributes this to Reagan 's acting ability, but Reagan was so popular precisely because, unlike virtually every other politician, he was n't acting. <p> Reagan 's willingness to sound the trumpet had its practical benefits within his Administration as well. Because there was clear direction that everyone understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( see " Dangerous Liaisons, " p. 32) would have been strangled at birth. " We were able to eliminate a lot of decisions before they got to the President because we all knew what Reagan had come to Washington for, " says Reagan 's former domestic-policy advisor, Gary Bauer. " The sense I get from the Bush Administration is that nothing is ruled out, that it 's just good government. The problem with that is that they do n't live in a good-government town. " <p> A closer look at that 70 per cent approval rating reveals some worrying soft spots. For one thing, the latest issue of The American Enterprise shows that before Iraq the numbers had started to drop sharply. In addition, a staggering 78 per cent of the American public has not much of an idea where Bush plans to lead the nation, suggesting that his approval is high but fuzzy. Another 60 per cent think things have gotten pretty seriously off on the wrong track ; although they are inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not as sharp as ii once was. At a time when the division in the country between Us out here and Them in Washington is widening, that 's a warning signal. <p> As this article goes to press the President will be addressing the nation before a Joint Session of Congress to discuss the situation in Iraq, the budget summit, and other problems( in his mind. To date he has handled the former brilliantly and has somewhat extricated himself from the blunders surrounding the latter, which is why the White House is not worried about alienating his conservative base. But the danger is there, for the smaller Bush 's base is the more dependent he becomes on developments outside his control, whether they are in the Mid-east, the USSR, or Congress. <p> " Approval ratings are just that -- approval, " says Gary Bauer. " They do n't measure passion, and there 's a big difference. Politicians tend to find that out the hard way. " <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureau chief. <p>
