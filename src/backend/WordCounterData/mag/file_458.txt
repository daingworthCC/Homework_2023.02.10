4075241 How to make this Hollywood look work in the real world. Tendrils may be reminiscent of another era( ' 80s, anyone?), but unlike the very deliberately placed pieces of the past, these wisps look like they happened by accident, says Jeanie Syfu, a TRESemm celebrity stylist. " The key to keeping this look modern is to make sure it 's not overstyled. " Try it for : A wedding, a party, or a fancy night out. Make it real : This style works best on someone with layered hair, or even a bobbed ' do, Syfu explains. The tendrils should n't be too long -- and they should always be in proportion to your style.( Sandra 's longer tendrils fit with her loose side bun while Nicole 's shorter pieces suit her more controlled chignon.) How to do it : Prep damp hair with mousse to give it body and grip. Our pick : Suave Professionals Volumizing Foam Mousse, $3. Next, " rough dry " -- that is, blow-dry hair with fingers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry, find your part and create your desired updo shape. Syfu favors a loose chignon over something really tight. " That way it 's naturally piece-y. " Using your fingers, gently pull down any loose wisps along the neck. If your hair is supercurly or pin-straight, run a flat iron with rounded edges( try Gold ' N Hot 1-Inch Professional Ceramic Straightening Iron, $50) through pieces to either straighten or give them a little bend. " Your ends should look finished, " Syfu says. " It 's meant to look just a little messy -- not like you rolled out of bed.
