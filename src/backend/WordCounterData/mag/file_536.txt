He then fled to France. <p> " FROM NOW ON, all protesters will be treated as Israeli spies. " This was the announcement made by the Revolutionary Guard a monlh after the Iranian people last took to the streets. In all likelihood, this quiet period can be explained by the revelations of torture cases and repeated prison rapes, as well as by the show trials in which numerous young protesters and key reformist ligures have been seen on television making peculiar confessions. <p> Today marks the occasion of Tehran 's traditional Jerusalem Day. Each year, the regime brings together thousands of its supporters, bussed in with the promise of free fruii juice and vasi television coverage, and shows the rest of the world, through iIs pro-Palestine - or. more importanlly, anti-Israel - rallies lhat it has lhe support of ils people. For several weeks, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a call for its supporters to use( his dale as an opportunity to lake Io lhe street again. Could it be thai the Green Movement suddenly has decided Io swear allegiance to the regime? <p> " We have entered a new phase, " Arya, who has gained back a few of those pounds he Iosl in jail, explains in an e-mail, " and we 're calling it lhe ' Great Hijack. ' By infiltrating( lie official procession with our protest, we should be sale from any violent repercussions. " <p> " Death lo America. " an aging man with a black beard shouts into a microphone. <p> " Death to Russia, ' ' lhe crowd responds in unison. Surprised and wondering whether he might have misheard, the man tries again. <p> " Death to Israel. " <p> " Death to Russia, "( the Islamic Republic 's greatest ally) the crowd continues. <p> We now are on Karim-Khan Avenue, where tens of thousands of Iranians have convened, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a newcomer, a 24-year-old smiling from ear to ear and timidly joining in with a few of the slogans, ft is Reza, and today he is on foot <p> " Mashailah, " UK taxi driver beams, using a term of appreciation. " This is my people. This atmosphere is just unbelievable. " He is right ; it feels like an eternity since June 's bullets rained down on his fellow men and women. <p> Behind the official flags of the Islamic Republic, a few families continue to chant their timeless revolutionary slogans, which must take some courage, surrounded as they are by thousands of green protesters. Perhaps the two sides really can live together - happily even - coexisting without hostility. There is at least one man, though, who can not take it anymore. <p> " Baba Hadji a respectful lam for a pilgrim who recently has returned from Mecca, " he shouts to lhe amusement of all, " ca n't you change the station? ' The huge crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ecstatic occupants. In one of these cars are Azadeh and her mother.? love you afl, " the younger woman screams from her open window. All of a sudden, a biker stops his motorbike a few feet in front of them, steps down from his vehicle, and abandons it right there in the middle of the street A chorus of car horns responds. <p> " Boba, are you nuts? Ca n't you see the line here? " one dumfounded driver cries. " Come back and get your bike. " <p> The biker turns around and shouts back, " Dadash bra. Park yours, too, and join the people. " <p> " The people of this country are jav guir lead by their emotions, " Arya smiles, " for better or for worse. " <p> The police also are present at today 's gathering, as are the Basijis militia, who are tearing round on their motorbikes, flexing their muscles in front of the crowd. Each time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from all around but, to everyone 's surprise, no punishment is dealt out. <p> " Hoda, Hoda... get down here right now, and bring your friends, " Azadeh cries into her cell phone to her best friend, unable to contain her excitement " It 's amazing ; they 're not attacking anybody ; hurry up. " <p> Intercepting text messages <p> Text messages still may be blocked, but phone calls are getting through at least A few minutes later, the young woman also decides to abandon her vehicle, fearful of missing even a minute of today 's spectacle. <p> Just a few moments ago, the ultra-conservative Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami made his announcement. " There are two main reasons for which we support Palestine and Jerusalem : first of all, because all Muslims are part of one unique nation and secondly, because we stand by all who are oppressed. The Zionists have tried to turn our Jerusalem Day into a failure, but they will not succeed. " Here he speaks the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Not Gaza, not Lebanon, I 'll sacrifice my life for Iran, " the crowd screams from KarimKhan Avenue. <p> " Not Gaza, not Lebanon, I 'll sacrifice my life for Iran, " Reza repeats. <p> The people have spoken, referring here to the astronomical sums transferred by the Iranian regime to Palestinian Hamas, as well as to Lebanon-based Hezbollah. <p> " But no, hang on, " Azadeh tries to interrupt " In Iran as well as Gaza, put an end to all the murder. " Her words are met with silence from her fellow protesters. <p> " Your slogan stinks, honey, " her mother shouts, followed by laughter all around. <p> Worried that despite his microphone, he is about to lose control of the situation, the elderly man from earlier moves on to a different chant <p> " Allah Akbar, " meaning " God is the Greatest " <p> " Allah Akbar " the crowd cries itself hoarse. The man can breathe again ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His tactics may have been a IiIfJe sly, but he is certainly not the only one at today 's event using his cunning to get attention. <p> Television stations are broadcasting live images of the huge gathering, filmed from helicopters overhead. " The Iranian people took to the streets today in the millions to show their solidarity with the Palestinian people, who have been under Israeli occupation for over six decades, " the commentator takes greal pleasure in announcing. ' They have also gathered in huge numbers in the cities of Bushehr, Rasht, Tabriz, Isfahan, Shiraz, Ahvaz, and Mashhad. " <p> The Iranian people are not so easily duped, " We 're used to being taken for fools, " Azi explains. Spotting the helicopter up above, the demonstrators wave their hands in greeting, brandishing their V for victory finger signs. Each person digs out some kind of sign - a banner, a ribbon, even lheir green nails - to show to which side they really belong. Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in the air. <p> " May dirt fall on my head to punish me for doubting my people and their solidarity, " Azadeh sobs. <p> ' Tomorrow, I want everyone to get themselves down to the bazaar, " shouts Mahnaz, a grandmother whose age nobody dares ask.? do n't want to see a single one of my children wearing anything other than green. " <p> The people are not the only ones making themselves heard today. <p> Their president - or rather the president put in place by the regime - has just made a thunderous announcement that only he can possibly explain, stating, once again, that the Holocaust is a " myth. " Mahmoud Ahmadinejad proclaims, ' The creation of this Zionist regime is based on false pretexts. It is a be based on a declaration that is both unproven and mythical. " <p> Opposite the University of Tehran, while the second-term president stands proudly for his interview with the state 's second largest television station, he is suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Ahmac/i! " " Resign, Resign! " <p> If only it could be so. Sidebar <p> Like much of the Middle East, Iran has been rife with rebellion against an oppressive regime.
