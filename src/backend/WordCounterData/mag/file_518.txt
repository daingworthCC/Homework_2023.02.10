4107241 They kiss, hug, fight, laugh, and butt-slap, all while turning out great meals as hosts of the new Cooking Channel show Extra Virgin. Now that 's hot food. <p> American food is too convenient. " In Italy, if you do n't have bread by 7 p.m., you 'd better have a friend with a restaurant, because the stores close, " Gabriele says. " When I married Debi 9 years ago and came to the United States, everything was available ; the stores were open 24/7 and I could get avocados or berries out of season. On one hand, I adore it. But it 's also a spoiler : I used to cherish that moment in May when we started getting cherries and strawberries for the first time. " <p> Family meals are our first priority. " Dinner is our time to teach our girls -- Evelina, who 's 9, and Giulia, who 's 5 -- table manners, " Debi says. " I remember my grandmother saying, ' Sit up straight! Clean your plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same way. Conversations around the table hold everybody together. " <p> We bring good snacks to school. " We 're the go-to parents whenever there 's a school party, " Debi says. " We bring healthy things -- a macedonia, which is strawberries with orange juice and mint, or a schiacciata alla fiorentina, which is like an angel food cake. At the last party they went to, the girls ate cupcakes with icing that was three inches high. They were bouncing off the walls. We let them have sugar, but in small doses. " <p> Cooking keeps us frisky. " In the kitchen, we listen to the Spanish Harlem Orchestra and salsa together, " Debi says. " Our girls come in and we spin them around and shake our butts. " Adds Gabriele : " There 's a sexiness in being close to my wife and enjoying something together. I do n't care what I 'm eating, as long as she 's there. " -- AS TOLD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home. People can see that we have Tupperware spilling out of every drawer, " Debi says. <p> " We 'll have kids over to make pizzas in our pizza oven, " says Gabriele. " Some kids try olives or proscuitto. When it 's a party, they feel more courageous about food. " <p> " I know Gabriele wants to cook alone when he plays Metallica, " Debi says. " I ca n't tolerate it. When I want the kitchen to myself, I 'll put on ' I Will Survive. ' " <p> " I eat junky BBQ potato chips when I 'm PMSing, " admits Debi. " I sneak the bag in the house without my kids seeing, but by that time it 's usually empty! " <p> " We keep pesto and tomato sauces in the freezer, " Gabriele says. " When we do n't feel like cooking, we boil pasta, and dinner is done. " <p> " Gabriele says it 's disrespectful when I smash garlic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or slice it thin. I tell him that garlic does n't have feelings! " <p> 5 THINGS YOU 'LL ALWAYS FIND IN OUR KITCHEN <p> IPOD DOCK <p> " I can not be in the kitchen without music, " says Gabriele. <p> NUTELLA <p> " We let the girls have it as a treat. " <p> RUFFINO CHIANTI <p> " Italians think of wine as an ingredient in a meal, " Gabriele says. " This bottle costs $12. " <p> BARILLA PASTA <p> " We put the pastina in soup for the girls when they 're sick. " <p> CAF BUSTELO <p> " It 's my favorite coffee, " Debi says. " It 's Cuban, with a strong flavor.
