4155641 Section : STAPLES # VT did an article with a few ideas for frozen meals " Cook Up a Storm, " March 2013, p. 54, but I would love to see an entire month 's plan with shopping list. As a working mother of two, I think that would be so fantastic! Thank you for a great magazine. Keep up the good work! # JAIME SULLIVAN VIA E-MAIL # Editor 's Note : While we do n't have a month 's worth of recipes for you, Jaime, be sure to check out Technique, " Preserving Summer " on p. 46 for some freezable recipes that will let you savor summer flavors, even in winter. #
