4106741 * 21ST-CENTURY MEDICINE <p> Nerves of Neon <p> One of the dangers in any operation is that the surgeon might nick a hidden nerve, leaving a patient in pain or even paralyzed. Scientists at the University of California, San Diego, have developed a way to make nerves glow so that surgeons can easily avoid them. The technique links a fluorescent peptide to a short chain of amino acids that attaches to nerves. The fluorescently labeled chain of amino acids is then injected into the patient 's bloodstream. Initial tests on isolated human tissue proved the technique works, but further research will be required before the FDA allows clinical trials. Researchers say similar methods can make specific tumor cells light up with different colors, helping a surgeon determine which tissues to remove. -- A.H. <p> MODERN CONSTRUCTION <p> * Meet the Smashbot <p> Renovating large structures requires the delicate demolition of interior concrete walls and stairs. Now a new wave of robots adds speed and safety to such work sites. Stanley 's F16 demolition robot, unveiled this year, can roll into tighter spaces than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wreak careful havoc on rebar and concrete. Just do n't expect to see this tiny tank in home garages any time soon -- prices start at $135,000. -- HARRY SAWYERS <p> 1 Armed and Ready <p> Workers fit the robot 's arm with attachments such as pavement-cracking impact chisels, rebar shears, hydraulic hand tools or 1500-ft-lb drop hammers that can smash 1000 square feet of 8-inch reinforced concrete slab per hour. The Cracker, above, extracts busted concrete. <p> 2 Extended Reach <p> Hydraulic cylinders enable the arm to reach 16.4 feet and rotate 360 degrees -- unprecedented mobility for this type of tool. The arm articulates to conduct down-ward strikes or to reach overhead targets. Try doing that with a hand-operated jackhammer. <p> 3 Getting Into the Job <p> The upper turret and boom can be removed so the machine can enter confined spaces. This feature, unique to the F16, enables the robot to do demolition work that would previously have required hydraulic pavement breakers, hand tools and sweat. <p> 4 Well-Balanced Machine <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four stabilizing outrigger legs raise the machine to a balanced operating position. A low center of gravity helps the relatively compact robot use tools formerly reserved for heavier machinery. <p> 5 Clean Operator <p> An electric 25-hp motor allows the F16 to work indoors without filling the space with fumes. The operator uses a remote control to keep a safe distance. Happily missing from the day 's work : a face full of concrete dust and hours of bone-shaking vibrations.
