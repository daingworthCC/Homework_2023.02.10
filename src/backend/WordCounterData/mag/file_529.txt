4108341 NOW. HERE. THIS. <p> THINK THE GAMES WERE BETTER BACK THEN? SNAP OUT OF YOUR GOOD OL DAZE <p> In Woody Allen 's Midnight In Paris- which if it is n't playing at a theater near you this very second will be soon and which you should definitely go see- Owen Wilson plays a man obsessed with the past. Traveling around Paris with his fiancee, he laments our current times, believing the best of days were the 1920s, when literary kings mixed with great artists and thinkers. Then, in one of those fanciful inventions Woody Allen specializes in, Wilson suddenly is transported there and finds himself hanging out with Hemingway and DaIi, Gertrude Stein and F. Scott Fitzgerald. It 's heaven for him, until he realizes that everyone during that time wishes he had lived in the Renaissance and everyone from the Renaissance wishes he had lived in Roman times and so on. <p> Wilson 's character comes to the realization that he romanticizes the past not because it was great but because the present, whatever age you live in, never feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts it : The reason the present is somewhat unsatisfying is because life itself is somewhat unsatisfying. But it 's all we have. We have to live in it. <p> There 's a lesson for sports fans in this, I think. <p> It seems every bit of sports commentary- and this comes from media, former athletes, coaches, everyone- operates with the thinking that sports were somehow better than they are now. That sports ' Golden Age has passed. That today 's athletes are n't as **40;18038;TOOLONG... that everyone is about the money, that the games just are n't as innocent as they once were. This is also called the " Pick Up The Newspaper, Shake Your Head, Tell Your Wife, ' The Whole World 's Goin ' To Hell ' " syndrome. Everybody does it. Everyone is always wrong. <p> This is not necessarily an indictment of any particular generation. I 'd argue that just about every generation believes that the world was perfect when they first perceived it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years. As I 've said : I think baseball was best when it was a speed game in the ' 80s ; my father thinks it was best in the ' 60s ; his dad thought it was best in the ' 30s. My son someday will think it was best in the 202Os. We will all be wrong. <p> Sports are always played better in the present, here and now. Markets become more efficient, not less. There is more money to be made, more competition, more of a talent pool, more everything, right now, this second, than there has been any time in human history. If you put Babe Ruth on the field now, he would strike out every time he batted, thanks to the curveballs, the sliders and the fastballssplit-fingered or 100 mph- all things he never saw anything close to.( He 'd be bewildered by all the nonwhite players, too.) This, by definition, means sports are " better. " They will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is human evolution. <p> So they 're " better " now. But what we 're really reacting to is that sports are different now, that we remember them solely from when we started loving them, which is probably why we all find ourselves longing for The Good 01 ' Days. This is a terrific human irony : At the very moment sports( or technology or whatever) are at their zenith, we are constitutionally incapable of recognizing it because we are so ruled by nostalgia. <p> This is OK. It is human. But let 's not kid ourselves : The best there has ever been is right in front of our faces. You do n't need Hemingway or F. Scott Fitzgerald to remind you of that. Sidebar <p> Ruth might represent what was great about baseball, but today 's stars continue to take the game to new heights. Sidebar <p> BOLD, DARING PREDICTIONS <p> 1. The calls for your major league team to call up its first-round pick, no matter how young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break. Everybody loves the backup quarterback. <p> 2. Now that I 've typed the words " NFL lockout " in this sentence, you will not even make it to the end of it without zoning out. I have the same reaction. <p> 3. I 'm so happy with how my St. Louis Cardinals are playing this year that I want someone to write one of those cheesy songs about them. You know the ones, usually put together by some local radio fella, like " New England, the Patriots and We " -that sort of thing. You will send me your cheesiest team song at will@deadspin.com. I want my eardrums to bleed. <p> How soon will M 's fans pine for Danny Hultzen? <p> PEOPLE OF THE FORTNIGHT <p> JIM TRESSEL. It 's a shame how his time in Columbus ended, but I 'm more fascinated by the fact that a man who looks like Jim Tressel- perhaps the most unassuming-looking man on earth- became most well-known for his clothing. I really think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> BRYCE HARPER. The Wunderkind phenom has received criticism for being immature, even though he 's 18 years old, richer than everyone you know and blessed with otherworldly talent that millions envy him for. Why would any of that make him cocky? AuthorAffiliation <p> Will Leitch is the author of four books, including Are We Winning? Fathers and Sons in the New Golden Age of Baseball.
