2000341 Al Sobotka, has been driving a Zamboni for the Detroit Res Wings since 1973. // How fast does a Zamboni go? Around 15 mph. Wow You drive that fast? Not too often. The reason is you 're trying to do a better job, fill every skate mark. But once in a while you step on it from one end to the other. It makes your hair fly when you hit it, you know? Is there special training required to drive a Zamboni? My training was all done on the job, learning a lot of it by mistakes and from the guys who worked here in the past. I always say I 'm still in training. How do you spot rookie drivers? Oh, God, they just look straight ahead They do n't observe what 's going on around them. I look all the way around the surface to see if I missed a big ice gouge from a skate. Some people go once around the outside and then come up the middle. But I like to go around twice. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice? No, I do n't get into that at all. The main concern is the quality of the ice. If it takes an extra minute to do it, that 's fine. But if there were a race, I 'd win. Does blood clean up pretty easily? Yeah, you got ta dry-shave it first-clean it without water. But if blood gets in the ice grooves, it 's hard to get out. Do you ever get asked for your autograph? All the time. Kids, mainly. Mr. Ilitch, our owner, asked me once. In 1995, he had me sign a napkin for him. I was privileged. Be honest : Is the Zamboni a chick magnet? It 's a magnet for everybody. Chicks get excited just as much as little kids. Even men get excited by it. Rides are auctioned off for charities and at special events. There have been functions that have gotten $2,000 for a ride. Do the players ever give you props @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of visiting players say they wish their ice was as good. If you get a compliment like that from Eric Lindros, that 's a good one. Guys who skate fast, like Paul Coffey, love our ice. How 'd you do in 1999s Zamboni driver of the year competition, in which fans got to vote for their favorite driver? I was runner-up. I got screwed, let 's put it that way. But that 's not important anymore ; it 's water down the drain. -Dan Snierson <p>
