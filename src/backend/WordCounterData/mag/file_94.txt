The United States Department of Agriculture 's( USDA) updated Food Guide Pyramid is the best source for meal planning -- whole grain breads and cereals, an abundance of fruits and vegetables, low fat milk and cheeses, legumes, lean meats, fish and poultry -- are all included in the overall plan.

However, to deny yourself the occasional treat will only cause you to eat more of something else, without satisfying the sweet craving yet, having more calorie intake than if you had the sweet in the first place. To begin implementing the changes, begin by concentrating on a few foods you are willing to substitute or limit, such as oven-baked tortilla chips instead of oil-fried chips, non-fat fruit flavored yogurt as an ice cream topping instead of syrups or whipped cream.
