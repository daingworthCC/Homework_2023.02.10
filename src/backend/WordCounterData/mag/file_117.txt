2014641 " Well, that just tears it! " Tom yelled as he hung up the phone. My mouth fell open. My stepfather was usually very calm and cool. It was part of what made him such a good police chief. " What happened, Tom? " I asked. " Another burglary, " he said. He put on his hat and headed toward the door. " And this one 's right across the street, at the Brewsters ' house. " The door slammed behind him. Toby was dozing under the table. But when he heard the door close, he jumped up and barked. He was just five months old, but he was already a good watchdog. " Good boy, " I praised him. Mom started clearing the dinner dishes. " Poor Tom, " she said. " Poor Tom " was right. This was the fourth burglary in less than two weeks. In a small town like Tylerville, that was a real crime wave. And now with a burglary right across the street from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furious. " I 'm going to take Toby out now and do dishes after, " I told Mom as I grabbed Toby 's leash. I wanted to go to the Brewsters ' to investigate. // " Fine, " she said. " I 'm going to grade papers. Remember to put out the trash. " " Right, " I said as I ran out the door. Toby and I were walking up the Brewsters ' driveway when Sergeant Lois Karpinski pulled up in her patrol car. " Hi, Pete, " she said. " How 's the new puppy? " " Great, " I said as we walked up the driveway together. " Toby 's really smart. " " He does n't bother your allergies? " she asked. I shook my head. " No. Westies have special hair. " Lois rang the Brewsters " bell, and Mr. Brewster opened the door. We followed Mr. Brewster into the living room. " When did you first realize someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brewster. " When I went to put away my earrings after work, " she said, " I saw that my jewelry box was empty. I called Larry, and we checked the silver. It 's all gone, too, plus a pair of gold goblets. They were a wedding gift from my grandmother. " Mrs. Brewster burst into tears. I looked around the room for clues. That 's when I saw something surprising-a tuft of dog hair lay on the floor. An alarm went off in my head. // " Tom, " I blurted, " I saw someone here today. Maybe it was the burglar! " My stepfather spun around. " Pete? What are you doing here? " he demanded. " I saw someone here today, " I repeated. " I was walking Toby after school, and I saw a man come around the side of the house. " Tom 's whole body tensed. " What did he look like? " he asked. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair, " I said slowly. " He was wearing a blueand-white jogging suit, and his dog- " " His dog? " Tom interrupted. " Yeah. He had a German shepherd with him. I figured they were coming from the field out back. " Tom sighed. " They probably were. Not many burglars take along the family pet. " " But look! " I picked up the tuft of hair. " A dog was here. Maybe the guy used him as a lookout. " " That 's probably from Barkley, " Mr. Brewster said. " He was here yesterday with the grandkids. " " Pete, was the man you saw carrying anything? " Tom asked. I shook my head. " No. " " Then he 's not our man, " said Tom. " Even though this guy takes only small items, he still needs a box or a bag to carry them. " My ears burned with embarrassment. Some detective I was! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " he said. " If other people were as observant as you, we 'd have this case solved already. " I swallowed hard and nodded. " I 'd better get home. " I was loading the dishwasher when the first sneeze came. It was quickly followed by four or five more. I blew my nose and tried to think of what had set off my allergies. Then I saw the tuft of hair I 'd found on the Brewsters ' living room floor. I thought I 'd dropped it, but it was stuck to my sweatshirt. I was about to throw it away when I realized that it could n't have come from Barkley. Barkley was a poodle, another dog that was better for people with allergies. My heart started beating faster. The hair was from the burglar 's dog. I just knew it. I forced myself to slow down and think things through. OK, the man I saw was n't carrying anything, I thought. Maybe the loot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, not fat. I bit my lip. Maybe.... " Pete, did you remember the garbage? " Mom called down. I groaned because, of course, I 'd forgotten. " I 'm on my way, " I yelled. While I carried the trash to the curb, Mr. Brewster brought out his bags, too. We waved to each other. I was halfway back to the house when it hit me. I let out a WHOOP! and went running across the street. As I fumbled with the tie on one of the Brewsters ' trash bags, Tom and Lois came out of the house. " Pete, what are you doing? " Tom sputtered. " It 's got to be here, " I said, " because the dog was n't Barklev and the guv was n't fat. " Lois looked at me like I 'd lost my mind, but Tom understood. " Get your flashlight, " he told Lois. A few minutes later, while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller plastic bag from the center of each large garbage bag. Inside the smaller bags were the missing jewelry, silver, and gold goblets. " Clever plan, " said Lois. " Rob the house the day before garbage pick up, and then come back later for the goods. " " Not clever enough, " said Tom. " We 've got him now. " At breakfast the next morning, Tom filled me in on how he and Lois had caught the burglar. They had found him digging the stolen loot out of the Brewsters ' trash a little after midnight. Later, at his apartment, they had found his dog and the valuables from the other burglaries. " And I could n't have done it without you, Pete, " said Tom, dropping his hat on my head. " You 're one smart detective. " " This is one time I 'm glad I have allergies, " I said. " If I had n't started sneezing, I never would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for crime, " said Tom with a grin. " That 's what you 've got. " " Just like my dad, " I said, watching him from under the brim of the hat. His eyes widened and then so did his grin. " That 's right, son, " he said, giving my shoulder a squeeze, " just like your dad. " // <p>
