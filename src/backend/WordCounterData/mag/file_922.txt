5012141 <p> A coalition of leading tech companies on Tuesday made public a vow never to aid any government in offensive cyberwarfare, while also promising to increase information sharing about malicious code to stem the tide of cybercrime. <p> Microsoft, Cloudflare, Facebook, Github and Cisco are among the 34 major global technology and security companies that have signed on to the Cybersecurity Tech Accord, a multilateral pledge to work together and defend consumers against cybercrime. <p> " The real-world consequences of cyberthreats have been repeatedly proved, " said Kevin Simzer, chief operating officer at TrendMicro, which also signed the agreement. " As an industry, we must band together to fight cybercriminals and stop future attacks from causing even more damage. " <p> The agreement, which calls to " empower civilians online and to improve the security, stability and resilience of cyberspace, " promises that each company will avoid aiding governments in bolstering their offensive cyber-capabilities, as well as protect against government " tampering or exploitation " of products and services, from the development stage to distribution. <p> " We will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere.

" <p> Advertisement <p> Alex Stamos, Facebook 's chief security officer, told Gizmodo that in signing on to the agreement, Facebook stood opposed to " any nation state or organization that tries to exploit technology and the people who try to use it. " <p> Additionally, the companies committed to mounting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out " new security practices and new features " for companies to deploy in their individual products and services ; and to " improve technical collaboration, coordinate vulnerability disclosures, share threats and minimize the potential for malicious code to be introduced into cyberspace. " <p> The signatories said their first meeting would be held at the RSA security conference in San Francisco, which is taking place this week, and would focus on " capacity building and collective action.
