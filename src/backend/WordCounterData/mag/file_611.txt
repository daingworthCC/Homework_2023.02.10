4142741 Western penstemon are a natural fit for dry, hot summers and cold winters # As A NURSERYMAN and landscape designer, I appreciate plants that are versatile, low maintenance and environmentally friendly. However, many gardeners who love the outgoing colors or forms of non-native plants operate under the misconception that most natives are weedy, boring and lacking in color. To the contrary, I 've found that many penstemon mix colorful beauty with low-maintenance practicality. These native perennials have great tolerance for heat, cold and drought. # Well more than 80 species of Penstemon are native to the Intermountain West, where gardeners are familiar with summer temperatures over 100F and winters that drop below 0. Most species have an abundance of tubular flowers that extend on tall stems from a low basal rosette. These flowers attract hummingbirds and butterflies. Bees easily crawl into them to gather nectar. As for size, penstemon range from groundcovers to six-foot spires. Their colors cover purples, reds and yellows. With such variety, I am always able to find a penstemon that meets the needs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in sustainability. Many species are drought tolerant ; most require no additional fertilizers. Deadheading can prolong seasonal color for spring-blooming penstemon, but there are also species that can provide color for each season without human intervention. Some look great even when not in bloom. As we take a look at several species, notice the many qualities that justify using penstemon in any garden. # NORTHERN AND MOUNTAIN SPECIES # Rocky Mountain penstemon( P. strictus) is commonly found in commercial trade. It is with good reason, too. The neon-blue flowers are especially attractive to bees. Also, it is more tolerant of overwatering and partial shade than other species. Wasatch penstemon( P. cyananthus) is similar in appearance to Rocky Mountain penstemon, with the same electric blue-purple flowers. It has a high tolerance for poor soils, and though it is not as drought tolerant as some of the Southwestern species, it still tolerates minimal water. Both Rocky Mountain and Wasatch penstemon can handle shade more than many penstemon species native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NAME PLANT SIZE( H X W) BLOOM HARDINESS mat penstemon P. caespitosus 3 in. x 9 in. purple ; early summer USDA Zones 4-7 wasatch penstemon P. cyananthus 1-3 ft. x 1 blue ; late spring-summer Zones 4-10 firecracker penstemon P. eatonii 2-3 ft. x 1 ft. red ; late spring-summer Zones 8-10 Palmer 's penstemon P. palmeri 4-5 ft. x 2 ft. light pink ; early summer Zones 4-9 pineleaf penstemon P. pinifolius 10-12 in. x 12-18 in. red-orange ; Zones 4-9 late spring-summer Bridges penstemon P. rostriflorus 24-36 in. x 15-18 red-orange ; Zones 4-8 in. midsummer-autumn Rocky Mountain P. strictus 18-24 in. x 24-36 in. purple ; late spring Zones 4-9 penstemon # Another great high-elevation penstemon is P. caespitosus, or mat penstemon. Naturally found in the Intermountain West at elevations from 7,000 to 9,000 feet, this ground-hugging species works well in rock gardens or as a groundcover. I have seen it in plantings that receive no water in the summer, and it retains its green foliage and still produces a bloom. It can handle both clay and sandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. # SOUTHWESTERN SPECIES # Bridges penstemon( P. rostriflorus) is one of my personal favorites. Vibrant orange-red tubular flowers cover this Intermountain and Southwest native from summer through fall, which is uncommon, as most penstemon species flower from spring into summer. Like most species, however, Bridges penstemon prefers well-drained soil. I was touring a demonstration garden in northern Utah last summer and saw this beauty looking perky and healthy. When I asked the caretaker how often that particular area of the garden was watered, he said that it had n't been watered all summer. This was in August! # Firecracker penstemon( P. eatonii) boasts fiery red flowers on stems that can reach over three feet tall. The leathery green leaves provide a stark contrast to the red flowers. Ranging from California to Colorado and Arizona to Utah, firecracker penstemon can tolerate moderately cold climates and high summer temperatures. This species is used very effectively in desert, foothill and high-plateau landscapes. I 've seen it used in gardens that remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times and similar water and soil requirements, Bridges penstemon and firecracker penstemon make great companion plants. # Palmer 's penstemon( P. palmeri) is found in the southern regions of the West. As with many Southwest plants, Palmer 's penstemon is extremely drought tolerant. With a natural elevation range up to 9,000 feet, it can withstand cold temperatures as well. The pastel pink flowers smell wonderful and, with a maximum height of six feet, Palmer 's makes for a great statement in any garden. # Another Southwestern penstemon and personal favorite is P. pinifolius, or pineleaf penstemon. It is smaller in size, reaching not much more than 18 inches tall and wide. The leaves are threadlike, hence the name pineleaf. I planted this one in my yard and have been very pleased with the results. The smaller red or yellow flowers and threadlike foliage make for a natural look--yet its somewhat compact habit also makes it a useful perennial in a more formal garden. It blooms in spring and the flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flowers. # With their drought tolerance, cold hardiness, value to wildlife and low resource requirements, penstemon are a great design choice, and they 're also readily available commercially. As the negative effects of chemical fertilizers and overuse of water become more apparent, well-adapted and native plants are more important than ever. Combine the sustainable attributes of penstemon with their many wonderful aesthetic qualities, and they become an obvious choice. # RECOMMENDED READING # Bringing Nature Home by Douglas Tallamy. **37;3353;TOOLONG # PENSTEMON BEYOND THE WEST # The species described in this article are western natives that grow most easily in their home region. However, several are adaptable to more humid and/ or rainier areas. Best bets across the United States include Penstemon pinifolius and P. strictus. Other choices for humid areas include P. tubaeflorus and P. digitalis, both eastern natives, and P. barbatus ' Elfin Pink '. Providing excellent drainage is the key wherever you grow penstemon.
