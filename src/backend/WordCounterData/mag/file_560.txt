4111441 Following our April cover story on Web browsers, readers weighed in this month both on browsers and on whether ' do not track ' proposals would be a good thing for the Internet Despite-or perhaps because of-their business-model, ad-Limiting implications, such rules might be a big hit with users. <p> Browser Pros and Cons <p> I was a bit surprised that the April review o browsers( " Which Browser Should You Use? ") left out the really good browsers in favor of the older but slower ones. The only newer browser you tested was RockMelt. but some users prefer Flock. I like Comodo Dragon the best of all. I also regularly use SlimBrowser and Maxthon. I do n't think IE, Opera, or Safari can hold a candle to them. I think you should have included some of the cutting-edge programs and not just the most popular. <p> Ed Paul, South Bend, Washington <p> Editor 's note : The alternative browsers **35;10678;TOOLONG downloa ds/d own load s.html. <p> After reading your article, I decided to see if Chrome or Firefox should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loading Web pages. <p> Chrome does indeed load pages very fast. But it lacks a menu bar. I use a desktop PC. with no touchscreen. I want keyboard shortcuts. Firefox loads pages pretty quickly, and it has a menu bar. But both Firefox and Chrome have a fatal flaw for me : The fonts are too faint for my 50-plus-year-old eyeballs! <p> Kurt Neuswanger <p> Grand Junction, Colorado <p> My concerns with IE and Chrome are their datacollection associations with major marketing and content services. Though I use Google and Microsoft services, I wo n't use either of them for anything that identifies or caches information regarding my purchases and banking. <p> Interrtet2k4, PCWortu.com forums <p> After reading this article. I installed RockMelt, which was new to me. It 's totally different from other browsers that I 've used before. It 's cool! <p> MingFengKuo.

When the Web was in its infancy, circa the late ' 90s. I could surf quickly on a 56-kbps modem and do AltaVista searches, and 99 percent of the hits would be useful. <p> Now, pages are so bloated with advertising and Link redirects that you need a behemoth of a machine and a fast connection just to be operational. And my search engine results are loaded with junk and " hits " from " meta " pages that are redirects to other pages. <p> This is progress? <p> mmagtiaro, PCWorld.com forums <p> Editor 's note : For additional discussion of " do not track " proposals and currently available browser add-ons, see page 15. <p> They Break, Do n't They? <p> Tony Bradley 's online column on the dangers of electronic books " Why the Demise of Print Media Is Bad for Humanity, " find.pcworld.com/ 72814 brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I was on a panel about ebooks. <p> The other panelists feti all over themselves, going on and on about the wonders of the technology and all the bells and whistles of their favorite model. The hour was about up when they realized that I had n't said anything yet. <p> When prompted to speak, I picked up a paperback novel from the table. I read out loud the publication date( 1947), then threw it up almost to the ceiling before it fell back to the floor. I reached down, picked it up. opened it scanned a page or two, muttered " Yes, good story, " then looked down at the ebook fanciers ' gadgets with a " go on.
