2014941 Green balloons, purple socks. Big yellow moon, shiny blocks. Through the windows of your eyes You see color, shape, and size. // Think of the things you can see : puppy dogs, fireworks, your favorite book or video, the friends you play with. You see all these things because of two wonderful windows in your body-your eyes. Look around. You 'll see that eyes come in different colors, shapes, and sizes. The first thing you notice about eyes is their color. Look in a mirror. The colored part of your eye is a circle of muscle called the iris. Your iris may be blue, brown, green, or even violet. The darker your eyes, the more color your irises have. People in the same family often have eyes the same color. If your grandpa has big brown eyes, probably one of your parents, your aunts, uncles, or cousins has big brown eyes. // That round black opening in the middle of your iris is your pupil. Your pupil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of light passes through. If you are outside in the bright sun, your pupils grow smaller to protect your inner eyes. If you are in a dark room, your pupils get bigger. Try it. Close your eyes and lightly cover them with your hands. Have a mirror ready. Count slowly to ten. Open your eyes and look quickly at your pupils. You can see them get smaller. Your eyeballs sit in bony openings in your skull. Layers of fat around the eye protect the eyeballs. Six small muscles are stretchy enough to let you move your eyes all around. The big work of your eyes goes on inside the eyeball. When light first falls on something we see, the light rays form a picture. This picture passes first through the cornea, a clear thin coating on the outside of your eye, almost like a window pane. From there, the picture goes through the pupil and onto your lens. The lens of your eye works just like the lens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lens sends the picture on through a big bunch of clear jellylike liquid with the funny name of vitreous humor. That jelly makes up the biggest part of the eye. The picture travels through the jelly and lands on the retina at the back of your eyeball. The retina sends a message to your brain : " Hey, I see something! " Next, the brain, your body 's built-in computer, tells you what you see. This all happens faster than you can snap your fingers. // Protecting your eyes with sunglasses and a hat is just as important as protecting your skin with sunscreen. // But wait a minute. If your eyes are this amazing, why do some people wear glasses? People need glasses when the lenses in their eyes do n't work quite right, so pictures are blurry and out of focus. The lenses in glasses help your eyes do the job they 're supposed to do. Eyes are important. That 's why you have eyelids, thin layers of skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tiny specks of dirt from falling into your eyes. Every time you blink, tears wash over your eyes to keep them clean and wet. It is important to help protect your eyes from bright sunlight by wearing a hat and sunglasses. Think about your eyes the next time you see a puppy, your friend, or your favorite toy. <p>
