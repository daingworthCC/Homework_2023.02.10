4139841 Beauty # BUH-BYE DRY SKIN. MAXIMIZE MOISTURE WITH THESE SMART TIPS # Smooth, supple skin is your best accessory -- it accentuates the beauty of your hue. But when the temperature drops, that dry, sometimes flaky, exterior threatens to rob you of your gift. It 's a signal that what lies beneath is out of whack, says Brooklyn dermatologist Hilary E. Baldwin, M.D. When the stratum corneum( our skin 's outer layer) loses its lipid layer -- made up of natural oils that help retain moisture -- cracks, flakes and, yes, ash can take over. Getting your moisture levels back on track may require a change of routine or a few well-chosen products, maybe both. Here we offer a plan of action. # ASH FACTOR : Harsh weather and indoor heat. Just as putting a glass of water on a radiator makes the liquid evaporate, overheated rooms and temperature-dipping weather can sap our skin 's moisture levels. What 's worse, once the skin is parched and cracked, the barrier that keeps the good stuff in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to infection and irritation. The latter is especially of concern if you already have a weakened immune system. # SKIN STRATEGY : Prep your skin beforehand with a creamy moisturizer with humectants that will draw moisture to the skin 's surface. Try Doctor 's Approach Nourishing Body Lotion( $15, doctorsapproach. com). And while you 're at it, do n't forget to seal your lips with a hydrating lip balm. We love Own Day Lip Treatment SPF 10( $10, Ulta). Another tip : Consider using an indoor humidifier to balance out the drying effects of high heat. # ASH FACTOR : Showering or bathing too long with hot water. The higher the water temperature and the longer the exposure, the more your skin 's surface oils, known as the natural moisturizing factor, are washed away. # SKIN STRATEGY : Limit hot showers and baths to a few minutes, max. Better yet, use lukewarm water and a mild soap to combat dryness. Then moisturize immediately after getting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Slathering on lotions and creams within this time window seals in moisture. Wait any longer, and your skin will have already dried out, lowering the lotion 's effectiveness, says Baldwin. Last, pat -- do n't rub -- yourself dry. # ASH FACTOR : Hormonal aging often leads to dry skin. The dip in estrogen levels slows cell turnover and impacts how our skin functions, from the amount of natural oils it produces to the way it absorbs and retains moisture, explains Marcy Street, M.D., founder and medical director of Doctor 's Approach Dermatology in Okemos, Michigan. # SKIN STRATEGY : Replace what 's been lost. Street suggests taking omega fish oils, which hydrate skin, and vitamin D, because it integrates with other hormones. Also try a skin-resurfacing treatment that follows crystal-free exfoliation with customized infusions like the Hydrafacial, suggests Olga Lorencin-Northrup, celebrity aesthetician and founder of Kinara Skin Care Clinic and Spa in Los Angeles.

When they 're depleted, skin is compromised. " Ceramides are critical, " says Baldwin. " They not only help to moisturize, but actually have the ability to repair the skin. " Maintain moisture balance with a hydrator like CeraVe Renewing SA Cream( $23, drugstores). # IS IT ECZEMA? # IF YOU ANSWER YES TO ONE OR MORE OF THESE STATEMENTS, YOUR DRY SKIN MAY ACTUALLY BE ATOPIC DERMATITIS, AKA ECZEMA.( CONSULT A DERMATOLOGIST TO CONFIRM YOUR SELF-DIAGNOSIS.) # 1 The affected area is uncontrollably itchy. # 2 Skin is often covered with a rash that comes and goes along with the itchiness.3 Area is easily irritated and appears red and inflamed.4 The skin 's texture feels like paper. # FIXMYSKIN Healing Balm( $12. lovelyskin.com). # Keep your showers short, and @ @ @ @ @ @
