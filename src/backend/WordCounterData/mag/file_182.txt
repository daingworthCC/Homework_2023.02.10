2022041 NOVELIST Walker Percy once was asked what concerned him most about the future of America. He responded : " Probably the fear of seeing America, with all its great strength and beauty and freedom gradually subside into decay through default and be defeated, not by the Communist movement but from within by weariness, boredom, cynicism, greed and in the end helplessness before its great problems. " The social science data confirm Percy 's concerns. They are uncomfortably close to becoming reality. Since 1960, the U.S. population has grown 41%, the gross domestic product nearly has tripled, and total levels of social spending by all levels of government( measured in constant 1990 dollars) have risen from $143,730,000,000 to $787,000,000,000 -- more than a fivefold increase. During the same 34-year period, there has been a more than 500% rise in violent crime ; a greater than 400% hike in illegitimate births ; a tripling of the percentage of children living in single-parent homes ; a threefold increase in teenage suicides ; a doubling in the divorce rate ; and a drop of almost 75 points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this period than the American family. Today, 30% of all births and almost 70% of all black births are to unmarried females. By the end of the century, according to the most reliable projections, 40% of all births and 80% of minority births will be out of wedlock. In a few years, illegitimacy will surpass divorce as the main cause of fatherlessness in the U.S. These figures have frightening social implications, but should not cause Americans to despair. Instead, they should stir the nation. There are three brief explanations for what accounts for America 's social regression. The first has to do with a marked shift in the public 's attitudes. According to social scientist James Q. Wilson, " The powers exercised by the institutions of social control have been constrained, and people, especially young people, have embraced an ethos that values self-expression over self-control. " During the last quarter-century, the American people increasingly have abandoned time-honored moral codes. The U.S. now is seeing the results being played out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and classrooms. A second is that a number of pernicious ideas made their way into the mainstream of American life. It became unfashionable to make value judgments. The nation witnessed an expansive notion of " rights " and an attenuated sense of personal responsibility. " If it feels good, do it " ; " Do your own thing " ; and " You only go around once in life, so you have to grab all the gusto you can " became words to live by. These seemingly innocuous phrases masked a destructive underlying philosophy that eventually found its way into public policy. A third explanation has to do with the failures of contemporary liberalism -- an ideology that dominates the national Democratic Party. A series of misguided social policies were championed. In the area of criminal justice, an anti-incarceration outlook took hold that said, in effect, society 's response to criminal behavior should be rehabilitation, not punishment. Schools replaced moral education with " values clarification, " standards were abandoned, and homework was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with government subsidies in the form of welfare checks. Through the National Endowment for the Arts, government got into the business of subsidizing pornography and obscenity. Abortion, for any reason, at any point in pregnancy, was elevated to a constitutional right. Tax policies penalized the traditional nuclear family. No-fault divorce laws made a mockery of the belief that marriage is a sacred covenant. Racial relations deteriorated as, in law and policy, people began to be judged not by the content of their character, but by the color of their skin( i.e., quotas, race-norming, and set-asides). These policies effectively tore down cultural guardrails. Not surprisingly, individual casualties followed. In his 1994 State of the Union address, Pres. Clinton expressed a deeply conservative sentiment : " And let 's be honest, we all know something else, too. Our problems go way beyond the reach of government. They 're rooted in the loss of values and the disappearance of work and the breakdown of our families and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on display when these words are contrasted with his 1992 Democratic Convention address : " I 'm fed up with politicians in Washington lecturing Americans about " family values. ' ' ") When public opinion calls for it, Clinton clearly can talk the values talk. Now, the public should insist that he walk the values walk. Americans should insist that he govern by his words and that he live by them. If the President is serious about his newfound, deeply felt interest in " values, " there are a number of tangible things that he and his party immediately can do to show it : * End the drug legalization talk by Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders ; increase the anti-drug budget for law enforcement ; and provide leadershp on the drug issue. * Reverse the decision to cut funds for the construction of Federal prisons and Federal law enforcement agencies such as the Drug Enforcement Administration, FBI, and others. * Appoint an attorney general who is serious about passing tough, intelligent law enforcement policies instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is engaged in a never-ending search for the " root causes " of crime.( One veteran drug prosecutor recently asked, " Am I now employed by the Justice Department or the Department of Social Work? ") * Support real welfare reform instead of huge funding increases for the welfare bureaucracy.( The 1993 Clinton budget included $110,000,000,000 over five years to fund completely conventional welfare programs.) Welfare reform should n't be a euphemism for a giant public works program. * Appoint an AIDS czar who does not believe that the real problem in America is a repressed Victorian society that denies sexuality early. * Support, instead of undermine, the Boy Scouts of America. * Provide tax relief to families with children. * Treat the military as it deserves to be, with respect and honor, not as a laboratory of social experimentation or the Federal government 's most loathed department. * Get the Department of Education to challenge the education establishment, instead of feeding it, and promote true education reform. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on, finally, is accountability. Clinton should be held accountable for how he governs, not by what he says. If that is the standard, he will remain extremely vulnerable on the issue of " values. " One of the things that eventually will erode public confidence in, and increase cynicism toward, the Clinton Administration is the enormous gap between what the President says and what he does. It is the responsibility of the " loyal opposition " to keep the light and the heat on the President and his radical social agenda. Accordingly, Republicans should not fall into the trap of merely cursing the political darkness ; they have an obligation to light candles as well. Those who strongly oppose the Clinton Administration 's liberal social agenda need to promote policies that would encourage cultural renewal and individual responsibility. Republicans should hammer home the point of how much better American life would be if a sweeping, reform-minded, and humane social agenda were implemented that included : * A more effective and tough-minded criminal justice system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Reform of the juvenile criminal justice system( including trying as adults juveniles who commit violent crimes). * Increased attention to victims ' rights and roles in the criminal justice process. * Reform of parole. * Enactment of " truth in sentencing " guidelines. * Alternative forms of punishment, such as boot camps. * An integrated anti-drug strategy. * Ceasing welfare payments for anyone having a child out of wedlock. One year after legislation is passed, all forms of economic support for single mothers who have new children should be ended -- including Aid to Families with Dependent Children payments, subsidized housing, and food stamps -- and visitation rights of fathers of children born out of wedlock should be terminated : Illegitimacy is America 's most serious social problem, and welfare is illegitimacy 's economic life-support system. It 's time to pull the plug. * The fundamental reform of education through national standards, merit pay, alternative certification, and, most important, allowing parents to choose the public, private, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. * Removal of the economic barriers that keep the underclass in poverty by providing tax incentives for businesses to locate in urban enterprise zones, as well as such items as tenant ownership and investment in low-income housing. * Support for families by increasing the Federal personal income tax dependent exemption. * Removal of major obstacles to adoption and increasing residential schools. congregate care facilities, and orphanages for abandoned ad abused children. It is well-known that there is some skittishness among Republicans in dealing with social issues. My response is : Philosophers from Aristotle on have understood that there is no more important political consideration than the moral precepts that underlie society and the policies that flow from them. No serious political party can duck these issues. Republicans simply must make sure that public officials deal with them in a responsible, thoughtful and constructive manner. Linking cultural and economic issues It is popular in some circles to argue that there is a dichotomy between " cultural conservatives " and " economic conservatives, " but that need not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlooked, link between cultural and economic issues. Consider two Census Bureau facts( brought to my attention by William Galston, Clinton 's Deputy Assistant for Domestic Policy) : The family income of black two-parent families is almost three times that of white single-parent families ; and children in white single-parent families are two-and-a-half times more likely to be living in poverty than those in black two-parent families. Here is the link, then, between the Index of Leading Cultural Indicators and the Index of Leading Economic Indicators. As Republicans address the set of issues that travel under the banner of " values, " they need to recognize that many of the problems afflicting society today are manifestly moral. Therefore, they are remarkably resistant to government cures, so there are limits to the degree to which public policies can cure what ails the U.S. The Republican Party needs to point out that not only are there some tasks that government can not do, in a nation of free and sovereign people, there are some tasks it should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the less they have asked of themselves. A compelling message might be this : The Republican philosophy is to say to the Federal government, " Give us back our money -- and with it, our sense of responsibility. " During the last decade of the 20th century, the failures of contemporary liberalism are all around. It is an intellectually and morally bankrupt ideology, one that no longer has the power to inspire people. A confident Republican Party, therefore, should offer a fundamentally different governing philosophy and set of solutions. The GOP 's task is to link the values debate to a specific set of policies, insist that moral common sense once again become the touchstone of social policy, and oppose the radical social agenda of the Clinton Administration in a principled, vigorous, and determined manner-all the while recognizing that this debate must be conducted in a calm, civilized, and reasoned voice. If Republicans do, their voices will be heard, their philosophy will prevail, and their prospects as a party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Republicans have the courage and the wisdom to seize them.
