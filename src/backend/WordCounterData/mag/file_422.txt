4051141 Men admit to their dirtiest deeds and most shameless scams ever. Dating Disaster " I was meeting a girl for dinner one evening, and she showed up extremely intoxicated. We carefully made our way to the table in the packed restaurant. During the meal, I looked down to cut a piece of my steak, and when I looked up, she was n't in front of me anymore. I looked around the restaurant for her, but she was gone. I figured she 'd bailed on me and signaled for the waiter to bring the check. Then I heard a coughing noise coming from under the table -- it was my date, head between her legs in the crash position, puking her guts out. Everyone in the entire place was staring at me like I was some asshole who was trying to get my date wasted. " -- Max, 31 Photograph : TAMARA SCHLESINGER.

E-Humiliation " I was giving a virtual presentation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my PC and could see my screen while I spoke on the conference call. My name is Chris, and one girl in my office had begun to affectionately refer to me as Chrissy. During the meeting, a message popped up on my desktop that read ' Hi, Chrissy! ' Slightly mortified but thinking little harm had been done, I e-mailed her when the meeting was on intermission and told her of her mistake. When the meeting began again, she replied by e-mail, with this notification popping up : ' Now they all know you 're secretly a girl! ' That was followed by a guy named Peter sending me an e-mail that read ' You forgot to wake me up this morning. ' Peter is my brother, but I doubt the execs knew that. " -- Chris, 25 Girlie Man " I was dating this girl, and one Saturday, she offered to take me to the movies. Since it was her idea, she offered to pay and said she would choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through that one, because we ended up going to see the girliest movie I could ever possibly imagine. We got inside, and I was getting comfortable, prepared to fall asleep... but to my surprise, it turned out to be an okay movie. I had gotten pretty into it when things took a turn for the worse onscreen, and I became superemotional. I looked to my left, and the woman sitting next to me was bawling hard-core. So I looked to see how my girl was reacting, and she was sitting there calm as all hell, like we were watching a basketball game or something! I tried to save face, but I could n't help it and ended up breaking down. She gave me this disgusted look, and I was so embarrassed that I broke things off with her after that. " -- Joel, 22 Raunchy Revise " My girlfriend and I went to Florida this past spring break to visit my brother and his wife. My girl brought along Cosmo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like and do n't like. Feeling flirtatious, she passed me the article and had me circle the tips I wanted her to try out on me. I also noted extra moves I 've been craving in the bedroom. Forgetting about the ' editing ' I 'd done, my girlfriend decided to give the Cosmo to my sister-in-law, who also loves the magazine. She then showed it to my brother, and they had a field day making fun of my sexual notations. My brother still wo n't let me live it down. That was the last time I 'll ever edit Cosmo for my girlfriend! " -- Jackson, 20 Not So Pumped Up " One night while I was out clubbing, I convinced this superhot girl to come hang out with me at my apartment. We headed to my bedroom and started really getting into it when she had to run to the bathroom. When she returned, she was laughing hysterically and holding a penis pump my friends had gotten me as a joke. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting out. " -- Chad, 24 Cocky Customer " I was at the drugstore picking up two 12-packs of condoms. The guy behind the counter jokingly asked if I was planning on having a long night. I went on and on, telling him all the juicy details about how great of a night it was going to be. We chatted for a while, and I told him a little bit about myself and that I attended school in the area. He went on to say he had a niece who went to the same school. " About two weeks later, I had a basketball game, and my girl and her family decided they wanted to see me play. Guess who showed up at the game? The guy who worked behind the counter -- he is my girlfriend 's uncle! I could n't look him in the eye the entire night. " -- Michael, 22 Busted by His Boxers " I had a girlfriend but was hooking up with one of my coworkers, Marissa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in a relationship, but after some snooping, she found out, and we had a huge fight. I assured her that she was the one I really wanted to be with but things were complicated. We kept seeing each other for a few weeks, but I could tell she was getting fed up with being the other woman. " One day after we had just finished hooking up, our conversation got especially heated, and she told me she no longer wanted to see me. She got up and left the room, then came back a few minutes later with a bag of all the stuff I had left at her apartment. I was pissed, so I went back to my girlfriend 's place and decided to forget about it. Well, that sure as hell did n't happen, because that weekend, my girlfriend came up to me with a basket of laundry she had been doing. Holding up a pair of my boxers, she asked ' What 's this? ' My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was here ' and ' Jason loves Marissa ' on the waistbands of all the underwear I had left there. " -- Jason, 28 Noisy Nooky " I run a lot, and as a result, I ended up with tendonitis in both knees. I have a prescription for extrastrength ibuprofen to reduce the swelling. One weekday, I was working and unable to pick up the medicine, so my mom offered to get it for me. When I finally got home, my girl surprised me with a quick visit before she went out of town. We ended up getting it on in my bedroom, and then the doorbell rang. Angrily, I put on my clothes to answer the door. It was my mom. She called me out to the patio and, while laughing, said ' Guess your knees were n't that swollen, huh? You might want to tell your lady friend to turn it down. I can hear her from outside. '? " -- Brett, 23 Liar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a bar one night, and in my lame-ass attempt to impress her, I pretended I was going to school at the local university to become a marine biologist. It turns out that she was in the same program at the same college that I had lied about being in. She asked how I liked Professor Boyle, and I responded, ' Oh, he 's great. Definitely the smartest guy I know. ' She gave me a funny look and told me that the professor is a woman. She totally caught me in the lie, and my chances with her were shattered.
