2034241 Section : Herb News Cherry pie a health food? Yes! It 's jam-packed with antioxidants, as are some other common goodies <p> Last month, I told you that herbal antioxidants, particularly grape seed extract, can slow the aging process and possibly keep cancer and other killer diseases at bay. This month, I have even more good news : A couple of very helpful herbal antioxidants are as close as your kitchen shelf, and many more are available at your drugstore or health food store.( For more information on herbal antioxidants, read " Herb News " on p. 105 of our November issue.) <p> But with all the antioxidant supplements available these days, why resort to herbs? Good question. Here 's my take on the subject : The antioxidant properties of herbs are just one of their many health benefits. They contain a number of chemicals that do many things. The antioxidant ginkgo, for instance, also improves circulation. <p> Most single chemical products do only one thing. They also usually act through a single mechanism, such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the body. The end result is a strong action-along with the strong possibility of a reaction. The multiple compounds in herbs act weakly on many different receptor sites. Since no single receptor site is strongly affected, side effects are minimal. <p> Let 's take a look at some very useful antioxidant herbs whose actions provide several benefits. Antioxidants in Your Spice Rack <p> Rosemary 's( Rosmarinus officinalis) spiky, evergreen-like leaves contain flavonoids that have antioxidant properties. In fact, this tasty herb 's antioxidant power was used for centuries to preserve food. One flavonoid in rosemary, diosmin, is reported to help strengthen capillaries, which can ease problems such as varicose veins and hemorrhoids. <p> Can rosemary help you stay young? In 1995, Japanese researchers found that two compounds in the herb, carnosol and carnosic acid, may help to protect body tissue and cells against the oxidative stresses that have been linked to diabetes, aging, and coronary arteriosclerosis. So feel free to liberally spike your lamb, chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission E, the world 's leading authority on herbs, has given the nod to using rosemary for circulation problems, such as low blood pressure, and for painful joints or muscles. Rosemary is often taken as a tea made from 1 teaspoon of the dried leaves per cup of water. To make tea using fresh leaves, double or triple the amount. <p> Sage( Salvia officinalis) also acts as an effective antioxidant. Additionally, Commission E approves its internal use for indigestion and excessive perspiration. In fact, many traditional herbalists recommend sage tea as a remedy for menopausal night sweats. Commission E also approves sage as a gargle for throat irritations. It may be drunk as a tea, using 1 teaspoon of the dried leaves per cup of water. <p> Some people report irritation and dryness of the mouth after consuming sage tea, so be cautious about using it too frequently. More Popular Herbal Antioxidants <p> Certain adaptogens, or tonics, such as Asian ginseng( Panax ginseng), cat 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chinensis) also act as antioxidants. The liver-protective effects of both schisandra and the well-known milk thistle( Silybum marianum) are due, at least in part, to such activity.( For more information on schisandra, see " Five Cutting-Edge Superherbs " on p. 110.) <p> Herbs in which antioxidant activity contributes to, but is not necessarily a major component of, their beneficial properties include ginkgo( Ginkgo biloba), which I recommend for cognitive deficiencies ; garlic( Allium sativum) for circulatory benefits ; and turmeric( Curcuma domestica) for its digestive properties. <p> Because these herbal products exist in so many forms( capsules, tablets, tinctures, etc.) and concentrations, the only general advice that I can give regarding amounts to be taken is to follow the dosage instructions on the label and look for standardized products. Delectable Fruits Have Major Anti-Aging Benefits <p> Fresh sour cherries( Prunus cerasus), which are so hard to find in markets these days but may grow in your garden, not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. A study has shown that 20 cherries contain as much as 25 milligrams( mg) of anthocyanidins-along with the attendant potent antioxidative effects. These tasty fruits also have anti-inflammatory properties, which may account for their folkloric use as treatments for arthritis and gout. <p> Fruits that act as antioxidants due to their oligomeric proanthocyanidin( OPC) content( as well as, in many cases, high concentrations of vitamin C) include both the American( Vaccinium corymbosum) and European( V. myrtillus) blueberry. The European variety is commonly called a bilberry. Another berry( not often grown in the US because it is an alternate host to the rust fungus that destroys white pine trees) is the American black currant( Ribes americanum). Flavorful European black currant( Ribes nigrum) jams made in France and Switzerland are widely available in the US. <p> The American cranberry( Vaccinium macrocarpon) is also a rich source of OPCs. These compounds are not only useful antioxidants but are also responsible for the fruit 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act as antiadhesins-they prevent the causative bacteria from adhering to the surface cells that line the urinary tract. Ten ounces of cranberry juice cocktail( one-third pure juice) daily is effective. The Most Delicious Antioxidant <p> I have kept the best for last : chocolate. This tasty sweet contains the same beneficial antioxidants found in red wine. Wine and chocolate, both consumed in moderate amounts, are now deemed to be beneficial to health, all because of OPCs and their pronounced antioxidative properties. A new study found that solid dark chocolate contains four times the amount of catechins, substances with antioxidant properties, as brewed tea. Heaven on earth!( For more information on the health benefits of chocolate, see " Wow, I Did n't Know That! " on p. 130.)
