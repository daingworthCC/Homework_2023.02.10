4084941 Not so long ago, shooting glasses with cheap, clear lenses were a gunner 's only recourse for eye protection, but today you can choose glasses with a variety of tinted lenses designed to help you focus on targets. Orange lenses, for example, filter blue light to enhance target color against the sky ; purple-vermilion makes the target stand out against a dark green background. Following the same basic concept as screw-in chokes are packages that offer replaceable lenses on a single frame, allowing you to switch lenses rather than glasses. We had four experienced clay-target shooters put replaceable-lens shooting glasses through their paces last summer to see which offer the best combination of lens clarity, ease of use, and durability. 1 SWITCH TENAYA LAKE( $170) switchvision.com * * * * * THE LOWDOWN All four testers lauded Switch Vision 's innovative system that uses embedded magnets to hold the lenses in place. It offers a secure mount, yet permits easy lens swaps. Moore found this appealing and said, " The glasses are practical for sporting clays, where light conditions differ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered great eye protection and were sturdy, said Paugh, who dropped them twice without any scratches resulting. " The fit and feel were awesome, " he added. Willms disagreed about the fit, saying the " glasses did n't mount high enough-the frame and nosepiece can be seen while shooting. " Moore also had an issue with fit ; for him, the drawback was a gap between the lens and cheek, which allowed glare to penetrate. HITS " The glasses are extremely well built and lightweight. " -Heelan MISSES " Nice product, but a lousy case. " -Willms 2 RANDOLPH ENGINEERING RANGER XLW( $270) randolphusa.com * * * * THE LOWDOWN The testers felt these glasses were well engineered and utilized good, optically clear lenses. Opinions differed after that. Heelan said the glasses provided " good frontal protection, " but he was n't able to get the nose pads to fit comfortably. He did note that the lenses were easy to switch out. Moore said the design allowed a shooter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved peripheral vision. " Willms noted that the frame mounted high enough so it was n't in his line of sight. Paugh, who liked the selection of lens colors, complained that there was a gap under the lenses that let in light. He did point out, however, that the light weight of the frames made them very comfortable to wear. HITS " The glasses have an awesome carrying case. " -Heelan MISSES " Given the price, I ca n't justify them for the shooting I do. " -Paugh 3 WILEY X GUARD( $75) wileyx.com * * * * THE LOWDOWN Coming in just 2 points behind the Randolphs, the X Guard has a wraparound configuration that appealed to three testers, with Moore dissenting. Though the fit anchored the glasses to his face in wind, he said the style felt awkward. The rest of the panel praised the design. " I like how they covered my eyes but did n't block my vision to the sides, " said Paugh. Heelan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " Willms said the glasses were a bargain for the price. Nonetheless, he felt they were unsuitable for clay-target shooting " because the frame and nosepiece get in the way. But they might make good hunting glasses. " Willms, Heelan, and Moore all thought the lenses were difficult to change, but Moore did say the lenses were well built. HITS " The glasses are so light, you ca n't feel them. " -Moore MISSES " The foam might wear out. " -Paugh 4 SUNBUSTER QUICK DRAW DUDE( $125) sunbuster.info * * * * THE LOWDOWN Though the testers felt these glasses offered adequate eye protection, they deducted points because they believed the frames were too heavy and the quality of the lenses lagged behind the others. Paugh " really noticed the extra weight, which made the glasses ride on the bridge of my nose. " Heelan said he was aware of some distortion " of target edges " while shooting, and thought the glasses sat " a little low on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection of lens colors, but said they were somewhat difficult to change. Willms also said the lenses were a little hard to change, but he liked the wraparound construction, " which should be good for hunting because it would keep out airborne debris. " HITS " The glasses offer great protection for the price point. " -Heelan MISSES " You have to clean the lenses every time you change them.
