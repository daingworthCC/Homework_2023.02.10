2007641 Brigitte von Boch has turned a neglected farm property in Germany into a hotel as charming as the lady herself BY CATHERINE CALVERT Photograph As the wife of Villeroy &; Boch 's CEO, Brigitte, left, had her pick of the company 's fine goods when she renovated Linslerhof, above. She also has an unerring eye, which shows in every delightful detail. // Nighttme at the old manor of Linslerhof, and the night noises are as they have been for a thousand years. The stomp and chomp of the horses comes from the stables, and a flap of wings signals an owl off on its evening tasks. Somewhere, a dog bays at the stars sprinkled over its head, and a cow ruminates, as shutters are latched with a click. A few of the old, low buildings with their orange-tile roofs now shelter dreamers instead of sacks of grain, however. In one window, a light still shines as a bather soaks in a deep tub ; in the next room, riding boots lie sprawled next to the bed, while their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep with a sigh. And as these guests settle in, Brigitte von Boch-whose grand design has created this luxurious hotel from a rambling collection of farm buildings-settles herself for the drive home over the sharp little hills of the Saarland, in Germany 's western corner. Linslerhof is von Boch 's project and pride, the place where she has exercised her considerable taste and surpassing charm to create a small country-house hotel on one of the many properties belonging to the von Boch family. That 's Boch as in Villeroy &; Boch, the ceramics company celebrating its 250th anniversary this year-and one of Europe 's most successful commercial empires. To Americans, Villeroy &; Boch means elegant table settings, but the company 's factories, in France and Germany, also produce tiles and bathtubs as well as crystal and, yes, beer steins. Brigitte 's husband Wendelin, a member of the eighth generation to run the family company, is CEO and manages the tableware division. Brigitte, who had her own fashion boutiques in Frankfurt before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate connections at the family homestead in Britten, but until recently had never run a hotel. She raised her four children with an emphasis on the countrified life the von Bochs have always enjoyed deep in their forested estates, but she also kept a house in London, shopped in France and busied herself with charity work. Then the idea for Linslerhof occurred. " If I 'd known then how hard I 'd work now, perhaps I 'd never have begun, " she says with a laugh, but anyone who 's followed her, long-legged in leather, at a fast pace over the 1,384 acres of the Linslerhof estate knows some project would have engaged her. The manor house and farm here had been in the family since 1860, though its roots were much older ; the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa hunted these forests 800 years ago, and the nuns followed.( " Nuns always knew the best places to live, " says Brigitte. " The air, the water, the lay of the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days is n't particularly profitable, so when Brigitte met a forester who wanted to start a hunting school on the old estate, she was immediately interested.The von Bochs had been hunters for six generations : " Our attics were full of antlers, " she says. So she cleared one of the barns for a classroom and hired the forester to start the state-of-the-art seminars, opening the school in April of 1994. Soon so many prospective hunters arrived that she began thinking about housing them. " There simply were n't enough good hotels in the neighborhood, " explains Brigitte. The Saarland, near the heavily industrialized Ruhr, is not on the tourist route, though the villages that crown the hilltops are charming, and green forests meet rolling fields as you trundle along the country roads. Brigitte looked at the eleven farm buildings that cluster together like a small village, horse barn next to hay barn next to manor house, and saw a hotel. She started renovating the rambling main house, once the estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I knew just what I liked in a hotel ; most of all, I wanted it to be informal, where guests would feel as if they were at a house party. " Brigitte, whose sense of style is as natural as her wide and ready smile, could only produce something special. Of course, Villeroy &; Boch bathtubs and tiles, glassware, cutlery and china were at hand. But the clever remodeling was all her own ; she preserved the fine old beams, created a whitewashed interior with polished floorboards, and began to fill it. Her style is amusing and lighthanded, and inspired by what lies around her as well as by what she 's seen on her travels. Curtain rods of iron end in cowshaped finials, and if she can find a toile with animals cavorting on it, she 'll order a bale. Certainly, there are some fine pieces of traditional German furniture, but when, for instance, she wanted pretty but utilitarian pieces like headboards, desks, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood furniture with borders seemingly cut by pinking shears, so pieces could be painted or left plain to make each room individual. " I just thought it might work, " she says. And her experiments, combined with a dash of wittiness, enliven every corner : the painted faux-marble columns and the checkerboard bathroom ; the hunting-horn light sconces and the mural, which details a medieval hunt, in the grand salon ; the tiles in the dining room that have footprints of animals imprinted in the clay. " I wanted to tell people not to worry about their shoes ; " laughs Brigitte. Photograph Linslerhof plays against type by being both country-house hotel and hunting lodge : in the Hubertus Saal, scenes from a medieval hunt ring a formal salon. // By September 1994, the first rooms were ready, and last June a new renovation brought the total to forty-seven rooms, tucked into the manor house and a neighboring former granary, each bed with Gummi Bears on the pillow and billowing white duvets to dive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her idea of the perfect hotel ; she 's just opened a spa with massages and aromatherapy under the high rafters. " It 's so peaceful, " she says, " so filled with a pleasant spirit, like a church. " Her son Oliver is launching a catalog in the spring of 1999 that will carry all that 's needed for the country life, from English tweeds to cachepots for the roses. Even the ancient little pilgrimage chapel has been restored down to the last angel-it 's still the place for weddings and the annual blessing of the animals. Many of the hotel guests are still hunters -you can see them studying away under the glazed gaze of a stuffed moose-but anyone who likes the country life will feel comfortable here. Linslerhof is a favorite with German visitors in tweeds, whose BMW 's and Mercedeses line the car park year-round, happy to fill the lungs with fresh air and the night with sound sleep. This is still very much a working farm ; it 's fun just to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty-five horses there, or watch the 240 Aberdeen Angus clump like storm clouds in the pasture. Those in search of the hardy life will find horses to ride, and there 's a nine-hole golf course nearby.As far as shopping is concerned : the Villeroy &; Boch factory outlet is n't far. The food is so good at Linslerhof that the dining rooms themselves are reason enough to visit. Brigitte renovated a former stable in country style-big open fireplaces, cheerful checked curtains, buttery-stucco wallsto house three restaurant rooms ranging in formality from a bierstube to a salon fit for a party. Hunting trophies from the attic line the walls, interspersed with old pictures of the von Boch family-look for a very young Wendelin astride a very fat pig. Here, as everywhere, Brigitte has worked on every detail, even designing a new pattern that Villeroy &; Boch made up for her tables. Candles on iron standards circle the massive pillars, where green boughs are tucked at Christmastime, and each season 's flowers fill the corners. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant, the St. Antonius, has just been named one of the best in Germany, and here, as everywhere, the thoroughly regional is mixed with international touches. Sit down, and in winter you 'll be met with a bowl of schmaltz, to spread on a piece of bread. " Oh, and you must try the beef, " Brigitte says. " It 's our own. " And out comes a fillet so fine, so tender under its mustard glaze, that it melts away in your mouth in seconds. After enjoying a meal in the restaurant, Brigitte goes back to work. She 's here almost every day, planning special events, consulting on the menu.( She is also busy transforming herself into the German Martha Stewart by writing books for son Oliver 's new imprint, Ovb Publishing. Her first book, Weihnachten, which focuses on one of her country 's great passions-decorating at Christmas-has just been published.) She whirls away, a swirl of blond hair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the manor, whose manner is hands-on. Photograph In the Wedding Room-one of forty-seven cozy rooms in the manor house and its former granary-animals frolic across a cheerful toile. Brigitte designed the headboard. // Beyond the wonderful food, the warm welcome and the bathrooms that are broad expanses of sparking Villeroy &; Boch porcelain, Brigitte 's pointed the way to " the real luxury in overcrowded Germanysimply finding land to be alone in, " she says, and opens the door to the fields and forest that surround the old house. Here, an early morning walk is n't quite solitarythere 's the flicker of birds ' wings, a curious Angus nosing through the fence, a wild boar or two in the underbrush-and in moments the quiet, the air, the haze of hills and swaying trees bring the ease of the outdoors, a fine contrast to the understated elegance within the walls of the house at ancient Linslerhof.
