IDEA NOTEBOOK : DIY MADE EASY PAGE 84 Holiday Dressing Circle your tree with this plaid skirt, which you can sew in five easy steps : STEP 1 Start with two pleated skirts. Working from the hem of one of the skirts, cut up through the waistband along a side seam to create a long rectangle of fabric. Repeat with second skirt.( If you 're using kilts, just open them up flat. Remove their buckles and set aside.) STEP 2 Measure 22 " up from the hem of one of the skirts and draw a line across with tailor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of fabric at the top, then hem. Next, measuring from one unfinished edge to the other, divide the skirt into thirds and cut into three pieces of equal widths. Repeat with second skirt. STEP 3 Pin the " right " sides of one piece of each skirt to face each other and sew along one of the unfinished edges to attach. Repeat, alternating between the two skirts until you have stitched all six pieces together in a row. If you 're working with kilts, make sure their frayed edges make up the outside edges of the final panels. Otherwise, finish these edges by turning under " on each side and hemming. STEP 4 Knot a length of embroidery floss or another strong thread at one end. Starting at the first fabric panel -- and working about 1 " down from the top seam -- loosely stitch through the pleats( or, if your skirt does n't have sharp pleats, loosely sew using a running stitch). Once you 've stitched the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knot the end several times. STEP 5 If you have kilt buckles( removed in Step 1), sew the straps onto one end panel and the metal buckles onto the other, matching them up so you can easily buckle the skirt to close it. If neither of your skirts came with buckles, sew four lengths of ribbon( two at the edge of one end panel and two on the other) and tie together.

Cut the paper perpendicular to the folds you made to create 2 " -wide stacks. Snip a corner off one end of the stack to create a pointed tip. Poke a threaded needle through the bottom of the stack, pull the string tight and knot the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces together to form a circle. Push a twig through the center for a stem. Repeat for each stack. WHITE TISSUE-PAPER FLOWER Cut out a 3 " x 7 " rectangle from a stack of four pieces of tissue paper. Fold the stack in half ; then cut out a petal shape, lining up the base of the petal with the fold( leave the paper connected at the fold). Unfold and rotate the petals so they overlap and form a flower. Bend one end of a 4 " piece of wire into a tiny loop ; pierce the other end down through the center of the flower and thread the flower onto the wire. Scrunch the petals forward and secure to the wire with floral tape ; then open them and fluff. Wrap the remaining wire around a twig.
