Compared with other dance styles, there 's less coordination between your arms and legs and only a little hip action, so tap dancing is actually easier than it looks. <p> Why it 's healthy <p> Even in a beginner 's class, you 'll be doing enough small hops and jumps to strengthen bones. And, according to a study in the Journal of Dance Medicine &; Science, tap dancing has less impact than running, making it a joint-friendly activity. Tap also increases the foot 's range of motion and strengthens fast-twitch muscles( the ones required for actions such as jumping). Off the dance floor, these improvements help you to be surer on your feet and protect you from injuries like ankle sprains. <p> You 'll love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type.
