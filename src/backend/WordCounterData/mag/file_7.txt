2001541. See also cover story of same issue A deer track tells a story. It can begin where a buck crosses a logging road in the Big Maine Woods, or where one rises from his bed in the Rockies -- anywhere Novembers are white, anywhere deer have wild country to roam and hunters have the freedom to follow. It is a tale that unfolds mile after mile, building suspense in a way that few other hunting methods can match, and it does n't end until you leave the track in defeat or raise your rifle in a moment of glory. For all the opportunities that tracking offers, true aficionados are rare. A core of plaid-jacketed disciples in the northeastern states have drawn attention to the method with pachyderm-size bucks, but most rank and file hunters continue to think of whitetails as being too alert to track close enough for a shot. Consequently, popular hunting tactics are predicated on the notion that it 's much wiser to let the deer come to you, rather than the other way around. But if you have the determination to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it takes, then you 're already halfway to shooting the animal standing at the end of it. I CHECK THE CONDITIONS Unless you possess a canine nose or a lifetime of experience, you need snow to have a chance at this game. Half a foot of overnight snowfall that stops with the dawn is about perfect, guaranteeing that any tracks you cross will be fresh and the snow underfoot will be silent. Gently falling snow is better yet, because precipitation drives scent to the ground, eliminating one sense from the deer 's arsenal of defenses. If conditions are poor, do n't become discouraged. A rutting buck will be able to hear you crunching over old snow but may be more concerned with sex than danger. You may get a shot when a deer becomes curious about what is following and investigates. Or you may have your chance when a buck and a doe that are traveling together separate when you disturb them, and the buck swings back to look for her. Maine hunter Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that walking whitetails generally stop on odd-numbered steps -- three, five, seven, and so on an irregular cadence he tries to duplicate when tracking over crunchy snow, hoping to trick deer into thinking that the intruder has four legs instead of two. II CUT A TRACK Along the northern tiers of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, as well as in parts of the upper Midwest and the foothills of the Rockies where I hunt whitetails, the most efficient way to find fresh tracks is to cruise logging roads. Because relatively few deer inhabit these remote environs( in many places, deer density is four to six animals per square mile) and road assistance is even scarcer, a four-wheel-drive with a good spare and a front-end winch, plus a chain saw for cutting downed trees from your route, can be as crucial to the success of a hunting trip as your rifle. You may easily cover many miles before finding a big track that 's fresh enough to follow. Alternatively, you can walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bucks that are looking for does or on the way from their feeding grounds to bedding areas. III READ THE SIGN Telling the difference between the track of an average buck and a doe can be difficult, but the track of a really big buck -- one that you can stick your fist into -- is about as much like the dainty imprint of a doe as a bobcat 's is like one made by a Siamese. Big bucks walk flat-footed and are more likely to show the indentations of their dewclaws. They also give the impression of a widely spaced, staggered stride, with outward pointing toes, whereas does leave a narrow trail of perfect hearts that point to where they 're going. Then, too, the farther you follow the hoofprints, the more likely you are to see where a buck 's rack has knocked the snow from brush or where he dribbled a little urine as he walked, something that a doe, which squats to pee neatly between her rear hooves, never does. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed that shows dark stains under the body from the buck 's tarsal glands. Far more difficult than assigning gender is assessing how long ago the sign was made. There 's no substitute for experience ; you 're going to follow a lot of long-gone bucks before you begin to understand how wind, temperature, and changes in the crystal structure of snow combine to alter a track 's appearance over time. Bernier says that the best way to learn is by tracking your dog. Take him out in the snow, then repeat the process at two-hour intervals and note how the appearance, texture, and color of his fresh tracks differ from the older ones. Do this under varying snow conditions throughout the winter. Then, when hunting season rolls around, note how your own tracks change by comparing your boot prints from dawn side by side with your boot prints made at noon or in the evening. IV STAY ON THE TRAIL Okay, you 've found the track of a big deer that your homework tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- check your compass and go. The most common mistake trackers make is following too slowly. During the rut, bucks travel widely in search of does that have come into estrus. If you mosey along, stalking each piece of cover with a step and pause, you 're never going to catch up. As a rule of thumb, match your pace to the deer 's. A walking deer leaves tracks about 18 inches apart ; a trotting buck, 3 to 4 feet. The second error hunters make is tracking with their heads to the ground. You are n't going to see any deer down there. Glance at the tracks briefly, noting their course for 5 or 10 feet( farther in open country), then pick up the slack by walking with your rifle at the ready and your eyes sweeping back and forth. Do n't tread directly on the track in case you lose it and need to go back -- and you will lose the track, even in the best snow conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a lot of other deer. Other times he may backtrack and then jump off to the side, a defensive maneuver to confuse carnivores that hunt by scent. When you lose a track, make a swing to one side and circle out in front. No luck? Make a bigger swing. Bucks often walk with the wind at their backs. You can try to keep the wind in your favor by leaving the track and circling ahead, but unless the country is relatively open or you know where that buck is likely to bed down, you 're just wasting time. Stay on the trail. You 'd be surprised at how many big bucks are tracked down and shot with the wind at the hunter 's back. Next to aging tracks, the most difficult aspect of this discipline is knowing when the deer is close at hand, dictating that you slow the pace. Often deer will begin to meander and browse a little before bedding down, leaving signs that may not be obvious to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover, slow down and look hard. Above all, never give up. I once jumped a buck three times in as many hours before finally getting a clear shot. If I 'd turned around the first time I made a mistake, I never would have given him the opportunity to make one later. V MAKE THE SHOT -- QUICKLY In deer tracking you do n't count antler tines. You do n't try to maneuver for a better shot. If you do, you do n't shoot the buck. The vast majority of whitetails will be aware of your presence before you are aware of theirs. They may pause for three or four seconds to look at you, or they may be out of the gate and running before you shoulder your rifle. Offhand shots are the rule, and you take follow-up shots as offered. Bernier prefers a pump-action rifle with a peep sight, a combination touted by many trackers as superior for rapid, accurate shooting. A low-power scope is arguably as fast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever gun you carry, practice with it until it becomes an unconscious extension of your arm. Larry Benoit, the famous Vermont deer tracker, has often said, " The hardest part is finding a big buck. The easiest part is getting them out. " True enough, but words of encouragement wo n't help much when you start at one end of a drag rope that 's looped around the antlers of a 200-pound-plus animal. Just keep in mind that all the miles you 've traveled to get yourself into this predicament were worth it. You 've joined the brotherhood of those few who can call themselves deer trackers and acquired a trophy that stands as testament to your woodsmanship, physical endurance, and courage -- the very attributes of the great game animal that lies at your feet. DO YOU KNOW YOUR TRACKS? -- FRESH : Check the edges of a track left in powdery snow with your finger. Fresh tracks give to the touch. Disturbed particles of snow will give a fresh track a feathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weather has changed. -- 2 HOURS OLD : In powdery snow the edges and midline ridge will set and become firm to the touch within an hour or two. A great way to tell if a print is fresh is to briefly place your bare hand down alongside it and compare the two, because your skin transmits heat to the snow at about the same rate as the deer 's hoof. -- TOO OLD : A track not worth following will look distorted and can fill with snow or debris. Under the right snow conditions, an old track can appear fresh in the shade. Check the trail in an open, sunlit spot, where the tracks will show distortion from melting. -- HOW BIG? A fully mature buck( 3 1/2 years old or older) will leave a track measuring 5 to 6 inches from toe tip to the back of the dewclaw( hoof length from 3 to 3 1/4 inches). Adult does and immature bucks seldom leave a track more than 4 inches in length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can lay a.30/06 cartridge crosswise inside the hoofprint or dewclaw spread, the deer that left it is fit for the wall. -- WHICH DEER? When you pick up the thread of a deer 's path where it leaves the confusion of other tracks, you may find that you 're following another deer. No two bucks walk exactly the same, and usually one toe will be longer or shaped differently than the other, or a chip in the hoof will make the track distinctive. Learn to recognize the characteristics of the buck you 're after so you wo n't waste time. -- IS HE CLOSE? According to tracking expert Dick Bernier, a reliable indicator that a deer is nearby is a J-hook in the trail. " That means the buck is about to lie down. Generally, I 'll drop right to my knees and start looking under tree limbs. If there 's any incline, that buck will probably bed on the uphill side. You have to be ready. " -- BUCK OR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track from a doe track. One clue you can consider is the trail 's pattern : The rear hooves of all deer tend to overlap the front hooves. But due to differences in pelvic structure, the rear tracks of a buck often land slightly inside the front hoofprints and sometimes fall a little short of them. A doe places her hind hooves on top of the front track and slightly outside of them. The toes of a heavy buck may splay out a little to each side, giving the impression of a widely spaced, staggered stride, whereas a doe 's neat tracks point to where she is heading. A heavy buck is also more likely to leave the impression of his dewclaws. -- OTHER SIGN : Do n't confine your observations only to tracks. Cold will quickly freeze lances of urine and pellets. If yellow snow gives to the touch and the pellets are soft with a shiny look, there 's a good chance the deer is n't too far down the trail. Bucks leave larger droppings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas a doe hunches back and urinates in a slight spray pattern straight between her rear hooves.
