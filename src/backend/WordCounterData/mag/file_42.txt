2005641 Celia Yette, born without arms, has overcome her physical challenges to live a normal life. // " Physically challenged " is the terminology that 29-year-old Celia Yette prefers to be called. But if you ever meet this 3-foot-0 woman who brims with confidence, self -- pride and beauty, you 'd immediately realize that whatever challenges she is faced with, she can overcome. Yette, who resides in Petersburg, VA, was born with no arms. Her mother, Lorraine Jackson, took thalidomide, a medication prescribed for pregnant women in the late 1960s and early 1970s to alleviate morning sickness while she carried Yette. Doctors had n't discovered yet that thalidomide caused a lot of babies to be born without limbs. Many many times Yette has asked God why such a traumatic thing happened to her. " Not that I would ever wish this on any of my other siblings, but I do wonder out of all of us, why I was the one chosen to have the physical difference, " said Yette, who has two brothers, Gregory Yette, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Cynthia Yette, 28. Through it all, Yette has survived and learned to live her life as normal as possible. Activities that people use arms and hands to do, Yette does with her size 9 feet and her toes. Eating, washing dishes, putting on make up, combing her hair, house cleaning, getting dressed, reading, writing, and cooking are all done with her feet, toes and the small parts of her upper arms, referred to by doctors as stumps. When Yette was 4 years old she had prosthetic arms, but they were too heavy and uncomfortable for her. She cried all the time while she tried to maneuver the heavy, hook-like arms. Eventually the doctors removed them. Since then she has relied on her feet and toes to be arms and fingers. " I have been using my feet for as long as I can remember, " said Yette. " I do n't remember not using them. My mom told me I thought I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, so I just started using my feet just kind of naturally like you would with your hands. " Photograph A Yette, who loves to read in her spare time, Photograph uses her toes to turn the pages of a book. Photograph Yette applies lipstick as she prepares to run an errand.

What takes a person with arms and hands a minute to do takes Yette five to complete. " I feel like I have to be patient about a lot of things, " said Yette. " For instance, doing dishes, anyone else can just walk up to the sink and get started. But I have to climb in the chair, sit next to the sink and then get started, and that takes extra minutes. Or, if I wanted to grab something from the cabinet, somebody else can just grab it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Growing up, Yette led a very happy childhood, and she credits this to her loving family. She says her family has been her rock, and they are the reason she has such a healthy and positive outlook on her life. " You would really have to meet my family to understand the person that I am, " said Yette. " My family has always accepted me and made me feel like them. I 'm Cel to them, and they 've always treated me just like anyone else. " As a result of her strong family roots, Yette also has a lot of self -- determination and ambition. " I 'm a lot like my father, Emmitt Yette. He 's very determined. And I 'm a lot like my mom too. They are both strong, but in different ways. My step father, Delmas Jackson, has contributed a lot to my life as well. " Once Yette left home to go to college at Virginia State University, where she earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of arts, both in English, she realized that the real world was n't as nurturing and kind as her family. " When you leave home and you run into people who do n't see you the same way or feel the same way, that really hurts, " said Yette. " And that was my experience in the beginning. That hurt a whole lot because I realized everybody did n't look at me the way my family did. " Photograph Yette stirs a pot of soup on the kitchen stove.

The type of car Yette needs to drive costs approximately $35,000, but she does not have a way to and from a job so she ca n't earn money to save for her dream vehicle. " It 's very frustrating, " said Yette about not being able to drive. " Here I am, 29 years old, and I hate depending on someone else to go to the grocery store, or even if I want to go out. If things were different I could just hop in my car and drive. " For now, she happily counts her blessings and is very grateful to God for all of the wonderful and kind people, family, and friends He has filled her life with.
