4051441 One woman 's journey to finnd the perfect wedding dress in any shade other than snowy white. I have never once imagined myself in a wedding dress. Not when I was little and liked to take my parents ' quilted wedding album off its shelf and admire, on its thick board pages, the photos of my dark-haired father and my mother with a ring of daisies on her head. And not when I grew old enough to see my own friends swathe themselves in yards of lace and satin and taffeta in subtly differing shades of cream and ivory and bone.

" You 'll see, " everyone says. " It all feels different when the time comes. " Photograph : Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker, in Morgane Le Fay Well, the time came and went, and at no moment did I long to wear anything specifically bridal. Which is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sense that getting married makes one a bride. I just never at any moment imagined myself in white. Photograph : Ellen DeGeneres with Portia de Rossi, in Zac Posen I suppose it felt absurd to participate in any sort of virginal charade at 33. My now-husband and I had been living together for two years before getting hitched. Our dirty laundry mingled in the hamper, and we wrapped up the recycling together on Monday nights. The idea of appearing before him, offered up by my dad, in some modest meringue I 'd kept scrupulously out of his sight struck me as impossibly goofy. And the other thing about wedding dresses : so much pressure. Way too much pressure to place on a single dress! All the fittings at the beautifully lit bridal salons while ladies in French-maid outfits offer small bottles of Perrier to your mother and friends... how could any dress live up to all that? I would be in endless fear of the great letdown if it was n't just exactly right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that my resistance to wedding dresses comes mostly out of a love of regular dresses. There are plenty of stunningly, epically beautiful gowns out there, and they come with far less cultural baggage attached. My engagement coincided with a season of beautiful, poetic color. A wander through Barneys revealed shocking pink at Balenciaga, emerald green at Prada, and( my favorite) beautiful blues at Lanvin. Photograph : Amy Larocca dancing with her father The truth of it, as far as tradition is concerned, is this : Brides wearing white is a relatively recent thing. Supposedly the tradition began in 1840 when Queen Victoria married Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha in mounds of white satin and lace, and engravings of the couple were published in the 19th-century equivalents of the supermarket tabloids. It became a symbol of wealth to wear white. Its associations with virginity came later.( Never mind that in many parts of the world, it is the color worn in mourning. Not exactly the vibe I 'm looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, of course, wear red, which is considered sort of scandalous in the West but has always struck me as appropriately festive. I have been to a few weddings where the( non-Indian) bride wore red, and it seemed completely beautiful, but it also made fashion sense. These brides have both porcelain skin and jet-black hair -- the perfect complexion for rich, shocking red. If that were my coloring, I 'd be straight on the phone to Decades, hunting down some vintage Valentino, stat! Photograph : Calvin Klein Collection But my concern had little to do with announcing wealth or purity or adhering to any sort of cultural tradition.( The truth is, we actually slipped down to city hall a week before our so-called wedding and took care of business. The ceremony that happened in front of our friends was funny, and it was warm, and it had no legal relevance whatsoever.) I really just wanted a dress that flattered, that did n't require a diet or complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York winter, when my skin is pale enough to see the blue webbing of my veins, white seemed like a fairly bad idea. I do best in blue. My dry-cleaning slips often read, " 4 dresses, navy. " It works with my eyes, which vacillate between blue and green depending on the weather. Photograph : Marchesa I am not alone, nor am I unique, in my desire to be a colorful bride. Sarah Jessica Parker got married in black( she later said she regretted it, though photos prove she looked incredible, and besides, she certainly got her wedding-dress fix onscreen), and Gwen Stefani 's Dior gown by John Galliano was several shades of pink, as was the Zac Posen confection that Portia de Rossi wore to marry Ellen DeGeneres last summer. Photograph : Lanvin I wanted my wedding dress to have some relationship to the clothes I wear every day, to connect to the person I am on all of those other, normal, not-getting-married days. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " make sure it is really about who you are. Be true to your own style. " This advice really resonates for me. My own style is relaxed ; I like clothes that are comfortable and on the simple end of the spectrum. My daily fare comes from Isabel Marant, Sari Gueron, Chlo, Marni, Derek Lam. I 'm no great fan of constriction. When I picture wedding dresses, it 's hard not to imagine mine winding up under a Miu Miu cardigan and over a pair of Lanvin flats, with a featherweight shawl from Denis Colomb wrapped around my neck. That is, after all, how I wear everything else. " It 's so weird, " says a friend of mine who is a bridal designer. " I have so many clients who spend their lives in Jil Sander and Calvin Klein, and then on their wedding day they want to look like a princess. " I do n't want to look like a princess. For some people, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from everyday life with a dress to match, so it only follows that that dress becomes a once-in-a-lifetime excuse to splurge on a couturelike experience. I fully endorse anyone 's desire to go for it. I would suggest, though, a quick zip through the designer floor of a really good shop. That lavender architectural strapless Calvin Klein? The price hovered around $3,500, which is a full $1,500 less than entry level at many upscale bridal salons. Ditto an ultrafeminine, timeless Marchesa that would look good toasting one of the anniversaries that calls for precious metal. Even an embellished skirt and blouse by Lanvin were a relative bargain. I did make a visit to Vera Wang, where the dresses were so beautiful that I wanted to sit and stare and touch and admire -- for a really long time. And there was color, too! Wang 's most recent collection showed a symphony of shades that was exquisite and subtle. Brides are increasingly asking for it, Wang says. In the end, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd seen a photo of the dress in a magazine. It was Wedgwood blue, which, I learned, was quite close to the " Wallis blue "( a light periwinkle concocted by Mainbocher) in which the Duchess of Windsor was wed -- dubious distinction, gorgeous color. The dress was deceptive in its simplicity : sheer panels of silk chiffon with a V neck and a tie that wrapped under the bust. The effect was almost Grecian. I had fewer fittings for the dress, in which I could happily both eat and breathe, than my husband had for his suit. It 's not unlike falling in love : quite easy when it 's right. We stumbled home after our wedding in the early hours of the morning to grab our suitcases ; we 'd planned for breakfast on a Caribbean beach. My dress, with its soft chiffon train, was a disaster. Many spilled drinks( mostly down the back, as I was doused midhug) and endless footprints and tears in the delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid. So I probably wo n't wear it again, which makes me sad. It would have, after all, looked great with a cardigan and a pair of K. Jacques. And I 'm sorry about this. But such utter destruction of one 's dress is a sign, I am told, of a great wedding -- and I 'll take a good time and a gown in tatters over pristine perfection any day.
