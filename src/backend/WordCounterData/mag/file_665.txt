4148941 Auto : INTEL : TEST DRIVES : TOP TECH : HOT RIDES # On the Outside : The Outlander gets new aerodynamic styling and a chopped top to achieve higher fuel economy, resulting in a return to a more wagon-like look for this third-generation compact SUV. # Below the Surface : High-strength steel in the modified floor and body framing ensures safety and reduces weight by more than 200 pounds. # Under the Hood : The annoying rubber-band power delivery from the continuously variable transmission was electronically recalibrated for the quick-revving 2.4-liter four-cylinder. The tachometer 's movements now actually follow the speedometer 's. That 's always nice. # In Your Wallet : The rearrangement of the Outlander 's furniture makes it a true seven-seater, adding versatility to performance upgrades at a price that competitors ca n't match. #
