2041841 Headnote Whether you 're searching for text, video, images, news, or local information, you have lots of options beyond Google. We tried dozens of search engines and found some worthy challengers to the king. BY JEFF BERTOLUCCI NOT MANY BRANDS BECOME VERBS, as in " I googled fill in the blank last night. " Nielsen/NetRatings " January 2007 report found that more than half of all Web queries in the United States in that month went through Google. The second-most-popular engine. Yahoo Search, garnered less than half that amount. Which led us to wonder : Does Google deserve all that traffic, or is it living off its reputation? Are people using it because they 're not aware of other, potentially better search engines? To find out, we pitted Google against its big-name competitors, Yahoo and Microsoft Live Search, as well as against smaller challengers such as AlltheWeb, AltaVista, and Ask.com-plus a couple dozen of the specialty search services, including Blogdigger, Picsearch, and TubeSurf. Our verdict? Google is indeed the best search engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests. Google 's index proved to be the most accurate, comprehensive, and timely of the bunch, It also bested the majority of the specialty-search sites we tried, meaning those that focus on a category or file type, such as videos, images, news, blogs, or local info delivered on a mobile phone. Recent enhancements to Live Search 's mobile component moved that service into the lead in our test searches for locai information, although you have to navigate manually to its mobile-optimized site rather than being redirected automatically when you log in from a cell phone or other handheld device( see our charts throughout this story for details). That said, the competition is fierceand Google had better stay on its toes. Its challengers are implementing some innovative tools and interface upgrades( Ask.com is particularly impressive in this area) that enhance the user experience and deliver more relevant information than do the standard ten blue links on a results page. We also like several useful tools that can help you go beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these services on page 90. UNDISPUTED CHAMP? IF YOU USE Google and are happy with it, you have no reason to switch engines. Simply put, Google is an excellent search tool. It scored at or near the top in every search category we tested, including the standard search for text information, as well as our searches for videos, images, news, blog postings, and local info. While other services performed as well or slightly better in specific areas, only Google aced virtually every test we threw at it. Our initial round of testing included dozens of general-purpose and specialty search sites ; the final two rounds focused on the top engines in each of our six categories from the initial round.( Browse to find.pcworld.com/57020 for our complete test questions and results.) This is n't to say that the search sites that did poorly in our tests do n't have noteworthy features. Ask.com deserves praise for its usability and its image searches, although in our text-query tests it was just so-so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and local( search, but it was a middling performer in image and video queries. In addition to the big dogs, dozens of specialty Web sites are devoted to searching for images, news, blogs, and other specific items. For some queries, these boutique engines are a good choice. Superpages.com and Whitepages.com, for instance, excel at people searches. And TubeSurf, a metasearch engine that simultaneously scans Google, MySpace, Yahoo, and YouTube for videos, is a quick way to query multiple sites. In many categories, however, including video, image, and news search, the big engines were just as good as-and often better than-the little guys. Maybe you 've heard that search engines all spit out the same list of hits. There 's some truth to this claim : For instance, when you query news-search sites about a major, breaking story, you can expect very similar results. But in our tests, the items returned varied considerably from engine to engine, particularly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, for example. Our query for Mardi Gras photographs often produced a motley mix of hits, everything from amateur close-ups of bleary-eyed revelers-who, frankly, could have been partying anywhere-to professional-caliber shots of the Mardi Gras parade. And a search for the moreobscure " windform " produced a grab bag of thumbnails, from patio decorations to wood sculptures.( We were actually looking for an image of a musical instrument called a windform, which is a horn that measures about 20 feet long.) Blog-search results were equally unpredictable. In one test we queried " Huffington Ubby "( without typing the quotation marks), our target match being an article from The Huffington Post blog on the trial verdict for former White House aide Lewis " Scooter " Libby-breaking news at the time. At several of the blog-search sites, such as Ice Rocket, Sphere, and Technorati, the results did n't include links to the target story, but rather pointed to articles on other blogs that mentioned The Huffington Post 's Libby piece. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the detour, while others are not. For the record, Google topped our blog-search tests, followed by the specialists Sphere and Blogdigger. Our scoring awarded a search engine three points if the first link in the results led to the target answer or site( or if the answer itself appeared at the top of the results page or within the first result). A link to the correct answer as the second or third result was worth two points, and a link to the correct response elsewhere in the top ten results scored one point.( For image search engines, which typically include more than ten thumbnails per page, we awarded a point if the target photo appeared on the first page.) If the target answer or item did n't appear anywhere on the first page, we awarded no points to the search engine. With some queries, we were seeking a particular news story or blog article. We deemed other answers accurate as long as they had the requested informationfor example, multiple sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of the United States. Some tests forced us to make judgment calls. A mobile search site that required us to enter an exact street address( for example, " 123 Main Street, Oak Park, California ") as the starting point for driving directions did n't score as well as one that needed only a city and state. WHAT 'S NEW IN SEARCH IT 'S HARD FOR many Internet users to remember the pre-Google Web, but there was a time when AltaVista ruled search, and before AltaVista, Magellan was the search service of choice. The history of the Web shows that people will switch to another engine in a heartbeat if it produces more accurate hits on their queries and is easy to use. So search vendors realize they need to be on top of their game. " The amount of competition that 's out there right now is benefiting the consumer, " says Microsoft Live Search senior product manager Justin Osmer. " We 're all trying to come up with the next great thing-the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in search. " Much of that innovation centers on how the services display results. Few people use their favorite engine 's news, image, and other specialty search tools, even if doing so would mean more accurate results. The trick for vendors, therefore, is to make their search algorithms smarter, giving them the ability to anticipate what the searcher really wants. If you enter " daffodil " in the Google search box, for example, the results page will display a few photos of daffodils above the Web hits. " What users really want is a picture of those things, " says Google software engineer Matt Cutts. When we tried out the same query in Ask.com, Microsoft Live Search, and Yahoo, none of them displayed an image of the flower in their results. To be fair, we did a similar search using " Eiffel Tower " ; this time, Google. Ask.com, and Yahoo displayed at least one photo of the Parisian landmark, but Live Search did not. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Parisian landmark through a handy " Eiffel Tower Photos " link in the Related Searches column, though.) The integration of news stories with Web-search results is a work in progress, with Ask.com leading the way, For instance, when we searched for " titan " and " flash memory "( two separate queries), only Askcom posted the latest headlines on related topics, including a link to a story on Saturn 's moon Titan, and another to a piece on Intel 's new flash memory storage-in both cases providing the information we were searching for. When it comes to movie-related queries, both Google and Yahoo appear to have a slight edge. We searched for " 300, " looking for information about the Warner Brothers film, which was in theatrical release at the time of our testing. The very first match returned by both Google and Yahoo provided links to the movie 's theatrical trailer and reviews, as well as a search box for entering z city or zip code to find local show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorrect when it attempted to guess our location based on the IP address of the DSL account we used for testing it was 74 miles off), and it listed movie theaters for Irvine, California, a good 90-minute car trip in Southern California traffic. Ask.com inquired if we meant " 300, the movie " ; we entered a zip code, clicked the supplied movie link, and received the expected trailer, reviews, and show-time links. SMART INTERFACE TRICKS THE BEST SEARCH-RESULT pages provide links to related items, even if the pages do n't include your exact query( a great Beatles photo when you query " John Lennon ", for example). It also helps if they know a little about you : If your IP address indicates that you live in the United States and you query " civil war ", you 're probably interested in the American Civil War and are looking for a war timeline, maps of the conflict, or maybe even biographies of Generals William T. Sherman and Robert E. Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and links. If you search for " WWII "( World War II), the service 's Narrow Your Search column to the right of the results helps fine-tune your query with such links as " History of WWII ' ', " Cause of WWII ' '. and soon. Yahoo and Live Search provide similar tools, but they 're neither as easy to use nor as comprehensive as Ask.com 's. Other sites are improving the user experience in different ways. For instance, Live Search has a " Smart Scroll " feature for image results. As you scroll down a collection of image thumbnails, the page reloads itself, adding thumbnails on the fly. Since there 's no pagination, you do n't have to click a link to load more images. In addition, Live Search 's Scratchpad is a handy visual-bookmarking tool ; you can drag images from the results page and drop them in the Scratchpad column on the right. When you 're scrolling through dozens or even hundreds of images, the Scratchpad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report or presentation. Not every interface trick works, even if it seems clever at first. Askcom 's Binoculars feature, for example, allows you to preview certain site results in a pop-up window by holding your pointer over results that have a binoculars icon associated with them. But for text-page previews, the large thumbnails do n't provide enough detail to help you determine the page 's content. HUMAN INSIGHT SEARCH SITES ARE adding more human opinions to search results. " If you 're looking for a hotel for your vacation, traditionally you 've gotten a list of hotels, " says Tim Mayer, Yahoo Search 's senior director of product management. " But there 's no person or authoritative expert saying, " I went to this hotel and recommend it. ' ' " One solution is to add more " human expertise " to the autogenerated results. Yahoo has a homegrown source of this content : The Yahoo Answers service( answers.yahoo.com) is an online community where users ask and answer questions on a variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posts to the bottom of some search-result pages. For instance, when you search for " summer vacations ", you will see a " Shared by Yahoos " section at the bottom of the results ; the section includes links to several summer-vacation " Best Answers "( meaning the most relevant), as chosen by Yahoo Answers users. Cynics may point out that this feature benefits Yahoo by routing users to its in-house content, boosting its page views as a result. Perhaps, but we found the Yahoo Answers opinions more relevant than many of the standard, top-ten hits, a few of which were just random links to vacation rentals. In contrast, Yahoo Answers posts were more interesting : One contributor described seven travel destinations in India, while another offered a comprehensive list of family-friendly theme parks. Opinionated results are a good start, but at present they are n't always blended smoothly with the conventional search results, usually being relegated to the bottom of the page. Few people are likely to scroll down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're just beginning to integrate this content, so we 're going to be learning more about how to rank it. Long term, we will incorporate it more aggressively on the search page. " The same " summer vacations " query run on Ask.com, Google, and Live Search produced a conventional( though mostly useful) collection of travel-site hits. While Live Search did serve up a link to an MSNBC message board on seasonal travel, it was labeled as merely " boards.live. com ' ', which gave us no indication that it was related to our search specifically. Yahoo 's " Also try " feature at the top of its results page presents related queries allied from users : Search for " muffins " on the site, and " Also try " lists " muffins recipe ", " banana muffins ", and other alternate forms of relevant content. MOBILE SEARCH USING SEARCH ON a mobile phone or other handheld device is a unique and sometimes frustrating experience. Odds are you 're traveling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nearby restaurant or gas station, the phone number of a long-lost friend, or tickets to a baseball game. But your device 's 12-button keypad or tiny thumb keyboard makes entering the wrong street address or zip code far too easy. Depending on your ISP and your physical location, your mobile Internet connection may not be particularly fast or reliable. And obviously, the road is no place to be searching for videos. All of the major search services help you retrieve local information on a mobile device. We found Microsoft Live Search for Mobile offered the most accurate local results, but only by a small margin over Google Maps, Yahoo Local, Ask City, and Whitepages.com. Live Search for Mobile worked particularly well at finding contact information for businesses and people. That said, you 'll want to use at least two mobile search sites, as different engines excel in different areas. For instance, if you 're searching for phonebook-style information, use Live Search for Mobile, Superpages.com. or Whitepages.com. To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ask.com, Google, or Yahoo-but use their Web search rather than the local-search option. What 's the difference between the two? The Web search allows traditional queries. Using our baseball example, if you 're in Los Angeles, you can enter " dodgers tickets " and find an online ticket site such as SrubHub. In contrast, local search may help you find the name, address, and phone number of a nearby ticket dealer-the kind of information you 'd get from a phone book-but what you 're probably looking for at the moment is an online seller. The mobile search engines we tested are optimized for handhelds. Some accomplish this more gracefully than others, however. On our first visit to Google Maps and Yahoo Local via our Nokia E62 phone, we had to click the Mobile link on their home pages to view the modified display ; on follow-up visits, both sites automatically switched to the mobile interface. By comparison, Ask City, Superpages.com, and Whitepages.com immediately recognized that we were connecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Using Live Search for Mobile was somewhat confusing : The main site( www.live.com) is n't optimized for mobile devices. Rather, we had to manually browse to ni.live.com to access the mobile-optimized service. Even though the search engines are optimized for handheld browsers, most of the sites they 'll point you to are n't. StubHub, for instance, is built for conventional browsing only, which makes it painful to navigate on the Nokia 's miniature screen. Indeed, when you 're viewing onJy a small portion of the page at a time, it 's easier to get lost. Ask City is one of several sites that attempt to reformat a page to fit the small screen, but the results are often just as difficult to use. GOGGLE 'S SECRET SAUCE SO HOW DOES Google maintain its edge over rivais? A comprehensive index is key, as is a fanatical devotion to excellence. " We live and breathe search. There are guys who 'll come in over the weekend. They 'll say,? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted Google to return this page. ' And then people will spend a few hours figuring out how to tune our algorithm to return more relevant results, " says Googte 's Matt Cults. Fair enough, but other sites certainly have their own search fanatics. So what else? Timeliness is crucial. Cults says, " If we do n't have an important document or breaking news within a day or two after it happens, we need to do better. It used to be that search engines would update once a month, and we 've led the charge in trying to return and refresh little bits of our index every day. " Within a week or two, Google has refreshed its Web index. Many of the smaller search engines license their indices from larger players and then massage the results with their own home-brewed algorithms, or via human indexing, a technique pioneered by Ask.com but now used by several search services. The Yahoo-owned AlltheWeb and AltaVista, for instance, each use their parent company 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Search is really Google in disguise. Why use a smaller site if it 's simply mirroring another engine 's results? For one thing, you might like its interface better. Google 's iconic, simpler-is-better approach is the industry standard-bearer : just a search box, a fanciful graphical treatment of the brand, plenty of white space, and no ads on the home page, Both Ask.com and Live Search mimic Google 's minimalist motif, although the former spices things up a bit by adding a handy Search Tools column on the right side of the screen, giving you easy access to useful search helpers that you might otherwise miss, such as the service 's encyclopedia, dictionary, and maps. AlltheWeb 's home page is unadorned as well( some might call it homely), consisting mostly of a query box and a few tabs for accessing specialty-search sections( news, pictures, and so on). On the other hand, its parent site is the Times Square of Search : Yahoo 's home page is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to other features that the search box at the top of the screen is easy to overlook entirely. Meanwhile, if you enter a query in AOL 's search field, you 'll get much the same results as you would by doing the same search at Google. Specialty engines vary in their presentation. This is illustrated by our two favorite blog-search sites, Blogdigger and Bloglines. Blogdigger adheres to Google 's less-is-more rule, while Bloglines uses its home page to pitch its RSS newsreader and blog-publishing tools. THE FUTURE OF SEARCH SEARCH SITES CONTINUALLY test new looks, some of which may go mainstream at some point. For instance, Ask.com 's Act X interface divides the results into three regions : The middle displays standard text and links, the left has links for expanding/narrowing a search, and the right serves up related dictionary and encyclopedia entries, as well as shopping links. Try it at find. pcworld.com/57017. Google lets the public test its experimental interfaces at www. searchmash.com. One company that is taking a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which lists search results in the left half of the browser and a preview of the first result in the right half. Each result has a Preview button you can dick to see the page. Or click the Next Result button to scroll through previews in sequence. In all these experimental interfaces, the search box is still the sole means of data entry. Do n't expect this to change anytime soon, although work continues on voice-driven search. Google recently took the wraps off its experimental Voice Local Search service : Dial 800/GOOG-411( 800/466-4411) to try it out yourself.( The company warns that the service is currently available only in the United States, for businesses in this country.)

ROLLYO : The big search engines are great for everyday queries, but what if the information you 're looking for is a bit esoteric? Rollyo( www.rollyo.com) is the place to go. Here you can create your own " Searchroll, " a customized search engine that provides results from up to 25 sites of your choosing. Getting started is easy : Enter a Searchroll name and some sites( Rollyo says 5 to 15 work best), and then pick a category( such as " News &; Media ' '). Add a few tags or keywords if you wish to help others find your creation. The real fun is in exploring other people 's Searchrolls. The site has lists of popular and recently added Searchrolls-who knew that Diane Von Furstenberg had one? -and you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. So if Google is n't delivering on your " Antarctic beach Volleyball " guery, Rollyo is the place to go. CONGOO : Ever hear of the " Dark Web "? It sounds ominous, but do n't be afraid. The term refers to the huge chunk of Web content that search engines ca n't index, including paidsubscription sites( such as that of the Wall Street Journal) and password-protected corporate and government databases. In addition, some pages ca n't be indexed because there are no links to their content, or because their very long and complex URLs are too difficult for search engines to crawl. Certainly, much of this content is hidden for a reason. A corporation, for instance, does n't want the product development and marketing plans on its intranet made public. But you do have a way to search many paid-content sites. Even better, you can access that content-some of it, anyway-without paying a penny. Congoo NetPass, a free utility that 's available at www. congoo.com, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories from 35 popular paid-content sites, including the online homes of Billboard, Encyclopaedia Britannica, New Republic, and the WSJ. You can make between 4 and 15 visits per month, depending on the site. When you exceed the monthly allotment of visits to a particular site, you 're prompted to subscribe to the service, since you 're apparently finding it useful. Browse to find.pcworld.corn/57018 to download the free Congoo NetPass toolbar, which attaches to your Internet Explorer or Firefox browser. Use it as you would any conventional toolbar : Simply type a query in the search box and press <Enter>. The service searches Yahoo for the standard Web results, but it also uses its own index to search for any related paid content, such as a full company profile from the MorningStar financial service. If you already use another search engine 's toolbar, you might find that installing Congoo 's shrinks your browser 's viewable area, but Just right-click your toolbar area and unchech the options you 're not using to enlarge your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and search, PreFound( www.prefound.com) lets you express your expertise in a subject by creating your own Groups, which are comprised of linhs to the best Web resources, whether news, images, video, or other information.

You could also become one of the site 's Featured Finders, who include university professors, outdoors enthusiasts, and even professional baseball players. Along with the PreFound search results for your query, you 'll find the standard Google listings.

Sidebar METHODOLOGY How We Tested the Search Engines OUR GOAL WAS to replicate the real-world use of search engines. Most people are n't search gurus or reference librarians, and they typically do n't use or understand Boolean commands( such as AND, OR, NOT) ; the average Web user simply goes to a search site, enters a word or phrase, and presses <Enter>. True, there are many ways to fine-tune a query-see the clip-and-save guide on page 98 for our favorite tricks-but most folks usually ca n't be bothered. That 's why we did n't place quotation marks( e.g., " hiking boots ") around our test queries, even though doing so would almost certainly have produced more-accurate hits. We tested a total of 55 services in six categories : general( text info) ; video ; mobile/local ; news ; Images ; and blogs. We conducted our tests over three weeks. We used ten terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance, our categories included technology, pop culture, research/academic topics, books, and travel/shopping( go to find.pcworld.com/57019 for more on our test procedures). In each category we posed what we considered an easy query and a difficult one : Just about every search engine could find the 2007 Academy Award winners, for example, but only a few could locate a portrait of Italian poet-philosopher Giambattista Vico. We tested the engines at different times of the day-morning, afternoon, and night-on all seven days of the week.( However, the time of day and the day of the week had no impact on the results.) We occasionally changed our queries, particularly in the news and blog categories, to keep them timely. For instance, our easy pop-culture query changed from " Academy Award winners " to " 2007 NCAA basketball tournament teams " later in testing. We performed all of our testing on the same Windows system, a 2-GHz Celeron desktop with 512MB of memory and a 1.5-megabits-per-second( download speed) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for query speed, but this typically varied by onfy fractions of a second. Among the most-popular search sites, we saw little difference in between the time we pressed <Enter> and the appearance of the search results. However, we did detect significant differences among the blog-search engines, with some smaller sites-such as Best of the Blogs-taking several seconds to post the results. For the local-search tests, we used a Nokia E62 smart phone. Author Affiliation Jeff Bertolucci is a freelance writer living in Southern California. <p>
