2035641 <p> An IRS audit is a nightmare for any taxpayer. If it happens to you, eight simple steps can help you avoid many headaches. <p> There are days when you wish the mailman would mind his own business. At least that 's how you feel when he delivers the most unwelcome letter you 'll get all year. Shortly after the turmoil of meeting the April 15th federal income tax deadline, you could receive in the mail an official notification that Your name was selected( along with about one million other Americans) to be audited in 1992. <p> No other letter -- except for the one mailed by the Army that began " Greetings... " -- is as disrupting. <p> And if you 're like most of us, you react with emotions that invite wrong conclusions. <p> Anger -- " The government is picking on me. " <p> Not so. Your return was selected for audit for one of two reasons ; either someone has " turned you in " or a computer has found too many inconsistencies in your statement. <p> " Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor reports someone for cheating ' on his or her tax return, " says Robert Anderson of Los Angeles, a former IRS agent and tax law specialist. " Normally this is nothing but sour grapes with no facts or documents to support the allegations. " <p> Most commonly you are audited because a computer has raised a number of " flags. " It 's a matter of percentage. If your tax return reveals deductions that, in the opinion of the IRS, exceed an acceptable percentage in a certain area, you will probably be selected for an audit. For instance, if you declare unusually high medical expenses or claim several thousand dollars in charitable contributions, your return triggers flags. If enough flags go up, your return is selected for audit. <p> Guilt -- " I must have done something wrong. " <p> Nonsense. Records indicate that most Americans are honest when filing tax returns. " Most of the returns we audit show no evidence that the taxpayer deliberately tried to cheat the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IRS in Jacksonville, Florida. " If there is a change, generally it 's the result of a mathematical error or the inability of the taxpayer to supply proof for claimed deductions. " <p> Fear -- " I 'm going to be fined... or worse. " <p> Again, not true. If a deduction is not allowed by the IRS, it 's probably because the auditor interprets the law differently from you. Usually the penalty amounts to little more than a few dollars for back taxes plus interest. <p> " Heavy fines and imprisonment imposed by the U.S. District Court result from an in-depth probe by the criminal investigation division of the IRS, " Euringer warns. " And this does not involve the average taxpayer -- only those who deliberately thumb their noses at the law. " <p> Revenge -- " I 'll get those guys at the IRS. " <p> Bad strategy. That attitude wo n't help you one bit. IRS auditors are professionals schooled in IRS codes. Sure, they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax. <p> Approaching an : audit with a superior attitude can be a big mistake. This puts the auditor on the defensive and can hurt you in the long run. <p> You 'll probably experience all of the above feelings when you receive your audit notice. And the feelings may be enhanced by exaggerated " war stories " of other people who have been audited. <p> Your anxieties increase once you realize that you 're entering unfamiliar territory with unusual ground rules. In every court of the land. a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty. At an IRS audit, the burden of proof is on you. <p> An IRS audit may not be the most pleasant way to spend an afternoon, but by following eight simple steps, you can avoid many headaches. Keep a positive attitude. Although our tax structure was created to generate funds necessary to run the federal government, the system includes certain deductions to which you may be entitled. If you have listed on your tax return only those deductions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearing at the audit. The law is on your side. Organize your material. Canceled checks, invoices, and receipts have been used as proof that certain expenses should be considered legitimate deductions. A valid receipt, of course, is your best evidence to support a claimed deduction. The IRS does not have to accept checks as the only proof that you spent money on tax deductible items. " After all, " as one auditor puts it, " a check only shows that money was spent. It does not prove for what it was spent. " Choose your tax preparer wisely. Income tax returns are not as simple as they once were. If you use only the so-called " short form, " you can probably get by without the help of a tax professional. However, if you 're like most Americans who choose to take advantage of legitimate deductions, hire a qualified tax expert to prepare your return. <p> Who can best help you? You have several options. Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculate our returns. In some cases, however, a CPA is only a tax preparer, not a-tax advisor. There 's a big difference. <p> A tax preparer is skilled at preparing forms. A tax advisor, on the other hand, knows the tax laws( which are constantly changing) and can advise you on deductions to which you are entitled -- some of which you may never have considered. <p> A growing number of taxpayers seek the counsel of an " enrolled agent. " An enrolled agent is one who has completed many hours of schooling in the tax code and has passed a two-day exam given by the IRS or someone who has been certified by the IRS after serving at least five years as an auditor. <p> 4. Take a tax advisor to the audit. Never go to your audit alone. Abraham Lincoln wrote : " Anyone who has himself as a lawyer has a fool for a client. " The same holds true during your audit. Only you do n't need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your taxes is the one to bring along. That CPA or enrolled agent can best answer questions posed by the auditor as to why a certain item was deducted and why certain figures were used to calculate the deductions. <p> Some tax preparers insist that you stay at home and let them present your case alone. Owen Oatley, an enrolled agent and former IRS auditor now living in Daytona Beach says, Too often a taxpayer complicates matters by voluteering unnecessary information or by showing hostility toward the auditor. " 5. Treat your auditor with dignity. Your auditor is a human being, not a computer. Respect the auditor as someone who has to do a job that is not met with applause. Contrary to the tales of woe you may hear, most auditors accept reasonable explanations as to why you claimed your deductions. However, you can be certain that any auditor will recoil at someone who obviously violates the rules or who scoffs at the system. 6. Know your avenues of appeal. If, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different opinion and orders you to pay more taxes, do n't raise your arms in surrender. You may appeal. <p> You may request a meeting with the auditor 's supervisor. He or she will review your case with you and/or your tax preparer. If you 're still not satisfied, you may visit your local IRS appeals office. Most taxpayers are able to resolve their differences with the IRS at this level. <p> If, after this meeting, you 're still unable to reach an agreement with the IRS, you. can argue your case in tax court. <p> Here 's a fact few people know : The IRS does not want to take you to tax court as long as you have a reasonable explanation for the deductions you have taken. If a judge rules in your favor, the verdict may establish a standard that will make it more difficult for the IRS to challenge taxpayers in the future. <p> 7. Be confident. Do n't be afraid of your auditor. The IRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are times when an agent will try to intimidate you. You 'll have plenty of opportunity during the audit to support the claims you 've listed on your return. <p> Also, never apologize for the deductions you took. " Last year many Americans actually overpaid their taxes, " Oatley says. " They were either unaware of the deductions which the federal government allows, or they were too afraid to take the deductions for fear they would be audited. " <p> The truth is the government not only allows you to take certain deductions, but also encourages you to do so. During this unstable economy, for example, if you 're willing to run a small business from your home, the federal government will actually assist you in funding your business. The government entitles you to deduct a portion of your automobile expenses... of your office supplies... of your travel... even of your home. <p> A free publication entitled Tax Guide for Small Business( publication #334) lists allowable deductions for small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. If you take legitimate deductions listed in this publication, you should have no fear of an audit. <p> 8. Tell the truth. Too many of us get into trouble when we " fudge " a bit on our tax returns or in our answers to questions that are posed by the auditor. <p> Beware the temptation to give false information to auditors. Remember, they have been trained to detect false receipts and most are experienced enough to recognize false answers. " IRS agents are sympathetic to logical reasons for deduction, " says tax attorney Robert Anderson. " But I do n't know of any agent who tolerates lying. " <p> So, let the mailman deliver whatever he wants. A letter notifying you that you 're going to be audited may not be the most pleasant thing to receive ; nonetheless, if you 've been honest with your tax return, you have nothing to fear. <p> PHOTO( COLOR) : Careful attention to detail will stand an honest taxpayer in good stead in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the friendly neighborhood IRS. <p> by John McCollister <p>
