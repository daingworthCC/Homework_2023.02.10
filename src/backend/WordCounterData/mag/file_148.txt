2018341 You know something is seriously wacky when a ski competition starts with a debate led by people who ski to the edge of death for a living, and when the voice of reason turns out to be the greatest hot dog who ever lived. Sure enough, the first-ever World Technical Skiing Championships at Blackcomb, British Columbia, turned into a circus of world-class wackiness. When you set out on one of the most impossible missions of all time -- to establish conclusively the two best all-around skiers, man and woman, in the world -- what else would you expect? What took place were three days of impudent weather and boisterous debate ; three days of impromptu comedy and questionable judging ; three days of uniformly brilliant, often inventive, and sometimes downright slapstick skiing. In short, three of the wackiest days ever to pass in the name of serious skiing competition. Conceived as a six-event test of all-around skiing ability, the World Technical Championships certainly looked reasonable enough on paper. Three events aimed to determine technical proficiency in short-radius turns, medium-radius turns, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in specific disciplines : an extreme run down Blackcomb 's renowned Couloir Extreme( a.k.a. Saudan Couloir), a GS race, and a mogul run. Bring together top guns from skiing 's various competitive battlefields -- racing, freestyle, extreme skiing, powder skiing, " demonstration " skiing, and so on -- and let " em have at it. It seemed a perfectly reasonable way to settle the best-all-around issue. It was n't. All pretense at reason was squashed at a meeting the evening before the first day of competition. The event 's director, Doug Perry, and the panel of five judges presented what they assumed would be a quick and simple -- and very reasonable -- review of the event 's format, scoring rules, and schedule. But they underestimated a five-foot-three-inch verbal hurricane by the name of Noel Lyons, the 1993 World Extreme Skiing Champion. She started by asking quite possibly the kookiest question ever asked in reference to skiing, which was : " Is it bigger than a bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium-radius turn, and the judges, understandably clueless as to whether a medium-radius turn is or is not of bread-box proportions, indicated that they 'd get to that question later. Which they did n't. Things quickly got worse. In the couloir, Perry said, all competitors would be expected to ski a front-and-center line. This got the extremists rightfully hot and bothered ; Doug Coombs and Eric DesLauriers joined Lyons in lambasting Perry and the judges for their wimpy approach to the extreme portion of the competition. Pretty soon Steve Mahre was up at the front of the room strutting his best Clarence Darrow stuff, stumping for a change in the way GS race times would be converted into points as part of each competitor 's overall score, and, what the hell, why not a complete revamping of the whole scoring format in general? The judges were looking battle-weary, and the competition had n't even begun. That 's when Wayne Wong, who back in the ' ' 70s was the most audaciously creative hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmly urged everybody to chill out. He suggested ever-so-calmly to Perry and the judges that they at least consider a change in the scoring. Which they did n't. So the meeting ended with unanimous agreement on only one critical point : Wayne Wong is still one of the coolest guys in all of skiing. Mike Farny knows a thing or two about how to approach an event like this. He 's a former winner of the All Japan Technical Skiing Championships, the 31-year-old big kahuna of " technical " skiing competitions.( The World Technicals were patterned, approximately but loosely, after Japanese technical-skiing events.) Farny had come as a spectator rather than a competitor, and he had sensible words of advice for those who were competing. " The point is not to try to win, " he said. " The point is to show the judges and the public what you can do well. " Right. Which is why every one of the 53 men and women who showed up for the competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- was trying to figure out what to do to win. In other words, what were the judges looking for? The official judging criteria were( 1) ski performance -- getting the ski to perform to its full design potential ;( 2) efficiency of movement ; and( 3) speed. Fair enough, but beyond the tissue-thin decoupage of the announced criteria lay an undefined no-man's-land for the judges to flounder in. Which they did. You could n't blame them ; stuck in an utterly thankless job, with little precedence as a guide, and having never judged an event quite like this, they were winging it. The scores ranged between 192 and 260, with a maximum of 300 possible. This distribution created the illusion of a painstaking, algorithmic process, as if several variables had been carefully considered. But when asked for a scoring breakdown, Olle Larsson -- race coach, technical expert, and one of the judges -- explained that only " an overall impression " was the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges " mantra in stonewalling any questions( of which there were many) about the scoring. It was more mysticism than judging, and in that light, a bread box seemed as worthy a judging standard as any other. Consider the outcome of the first event, the test of medium-radius turning. Felix McGrath, the former U.S. Ski Team slalom specialist, laid down arcs that looked suspiciously like slalom turns, of which a baker 's dozen could have fit in a bread box. His score ended up third best. Pro racer Mathias Berthold let loose with magnificently oversized Super G turns, each certainly several bread boxes ' worth. He earned the second-highest score. Then along came Marc Garcia, former French national teamer and former pro racer, his tete raffishly swathed in a neon bandana. Garcia etched the slope with smooth, economical, and energetic turns measuring about halfway between the Berthold and McGrath standards -- and placed first. A veteran star of the Japanese tech-skiing wars, Garcia seemed to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper relationship between a bread box and the theoretical medium-radius norm. Meanwhile, among the women, Noel Lyons finished next to last in what shaped up as a gruesome day in a gruesome competition for extreme skiers. Among the men, DesLauriers tied for 28th( out of 40 skiers), Coombs tied for 36th. In the afternoon 's short-radius event, DesLauriers finished next to last, Coombs dead last. The extreme camp was a mix of humility, commiseration, anger, and eventually ironic humor. When Coombs finally nudged out DesLauriers by one point in the mixed-radius event the next morning -- the two were still 37th and 38th, respectively -- he pronounced, " I smoked you! " The extremists thought they were getting jobbed by the judges, and maybe they were. But for all of the mystical inconsistencies in the scoring, the judges deserved considerable credit for getting right the matter that counted most : In this three-pronged test of technical precision, Garcia and Christa Hartmann( member of the Austrian national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Georg Hollrigl, one of the event 's judges) were the indisputable top dogs. Only McGrath, his skis so far apart that you could have fit a basketball between them, and former U.S. Ski Team star Tamara McKinney came close. What was disputable, however, and wacky as well, was the scoring in the couloir event, which took place in the afternoon of the second day. Out of the snow squalls and hail and misery and clowning and trepidation and rule-breaking that marked this bizarre " extreme " contest, in what was supposed to be the most daringly, thrillingly free-form event of the championships, Garcia and Hartmann emerged on top again -- by skiing with such clinical conservatism as to squeeze new meaning into the word " technical. " That only gave new gusto to the question that hung like a haze over the three days of competition : What was this event really all about? Its title proclaimed it to be a technical championship, yet it reached for much higher ground than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to crown not just the world 's best technical skiers but the world 's best skiers. Period. Such a lofty ambition could only beg an obvious and troublesome question : What is the mythical ideal? Put another way : What talents should distinguish the world 's best all-around skiers? Make clean, efficient turns of any size, bigger and smaller than a bread box. Ski fast without any perceptible loss of control or fear. Smoke through moguls. Ski steeps unhesitatingly and aggressively. These things, at any rate, composed the World Technical ideal. Well and good -- but what constitutes smoking the moguls or conquering the steeps? Such notions are open to many interpretations. The judging, and disenchantment with the judging, was proving that. These interpretations are further complicated by inevitable questions of balance, e.g. : Is the guy who is brilliant on a racecourse but only fair in moguls a better all-around skier than the master of the moguls with middling racecourse times? Consider also a question the World Technicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skiers be fearless and acrobatic aerialists? Finally, consider matters most ticklish of all, questions of pure aesthetics : Should n't the world 's best all-around skiers demonstrate such intangibles as joy, elegance, lightness, imagination, flair, and even humor? If you 're capable of devising a formula to answer such questions beyond a shadow of argumentation, then you would have been a deathly and unwelcome bore at the World Technical Skiing Championships. Because half the fun of the championships was not the competition itself, but the unending stream of discussion about the competition -- what it could be, should be, might be, might have been. As April wound into May, the restaurants, bars, hotel rooms, and sundecks of Blackcomb were filled with high-minded, beer-bolstered debates that twisted themselves into knots of irresolution. Wayne Wong observed, " This is as crazy as the early days of freestyle. " Crazy, as in crazy with talk and ideas and more talk spinning late into the night, crazy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Championships, for all of its ambiguities and shortcomings, had the promise and potential to turn into something really big. But what, exactly? Opinions came and went furiously. Ove Nygren, the motorcycle-racing man-child of the U.S. Pro Tour, was among the air-happy honchos who thought the event should include a gelandesprung.( Not a bad idea.) Many competitors thought that three precision-turning events amounted to overkill, even if precision-turning most closely fit the definition of a " technical skiing " championship. Nobody, of course, cared for the judging, even the judges, but could anyone have reasonably expected the sudden, miraculous intervention of a better scoring idea? It took freestyle years to hammer out a code of objective judging standards, and it continues to be tweaked. Why should the World Technicals be expected to get things right in the first burst out of the blocks? And above the frenzied disharmony of ideas invariably rose the descant voice of Noel Lyons, still inconsolably irate that the couloir contest was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it something else, " she said, in a voice edgy with defiance, " but do n't call it extreme. " Wayne Wong was n't so sure about that. Sitting in front of the Horstman Hut at Blackcomb 's summit, Wong had been watching the fast-moving curtain of a fierce squall obscure glaciers and high ridges in gray blankness. " I just do n't want to bite it, " said Wong about his upcoming tussle with the couloir, worrying that, regardless of whatever Noel Lyons might think, the couloir could be plenty extreme, especially if it started hailing. Which, at that moment, it did. Even so, Lyons had a point. The center of the couloir, where the competitors were expected to do their thing, had seen so much traffic that it had become a long stairway of boulder-sized, boulder-hard moguls. Furthermore, the competitors had been asked, prior to the event, to sideslip the course in order to pack down loose snow from recent storms. Lyons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every competitor agreed. Extreme? A well-packed mogul run? You got ta be kidding. The only extreme element left was the weather, which for some skiers was more than enough. Snow squalls, flat light, hail -- the bad-weather luck of some competitors might indeed turn a packed mogul run into an extreme free-fall of blind terror. Not for Doug Lewis, who never met a wacky idea he would n't consider seriously. Hopelessly buried in the standings, the former U.S. Team downhiller had given up on trying to please the judges. He was going to have some fun. So he skied far off course to make silly faces for a camera crew, then blitzed the last third of the couloir in a full tuck. He capped his run by snapping off one ski at the finish and melodramatically thrusting it over his head in the cliched victory gesture of World Cup racing. It was such goofball stuff that you just had to love it. Which the judges did n't. DesLauriers and Coombs felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ski wonderfully dreadnought lines through the cliff bands and chutes along the couloir 's edge, and the hell with the rules. They wee going with the Mike Farny principle : Show the world your best stuff. Something very right was beginning to happen in this extreme event. Coombs ' and DesLauriers ' imagination, surefootedness, and deft skill at finding lines through the rocks drew loud cheers from the competitors and spectators at the top of the couloir. Among them, Mathias Berthold murmured approval, expressing the respect that had been building throughout the competition between racers and extremists. But you 'd assume the judges would not be so appreciative. Which they were n't. Steve Mahre, drawing a lucky few minutes of sunshine, had the run of the afternoon -- a wide-arcing mambo of incomparable grace and speed, featuring the power carving and rock-solid, cantilevered balance that are hallmarks of a classic Mahre turn. Short turns, long turns, in and out of the fall line, all at high speed -- if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " this was it. In a perfect world where righteousness rules, that would have been the top-scoring run. Which it was n't. Garcia 's clinical run was. And in a perfect world, the women 's event, beset by weather misery, would have been canceled. At one point, the sad, lonesome figure of Katie Harvey, champion in the 24 Hours of Aspen marathon, stood frozen in the starting gate, waiting 30 minutes for a squall to pass. At another point, the sad, lonesome figure of Janice Morgan, member of Canada 's national demonstration team, rolled like tumbleweed through the heart of the couloir.( She was unhurt.) And from somewhere out of the ill-tempered weather and the loss of enthusiasm and the specter of imminent hypothermia and the gloom of a fast-encroaching evening appeared Christa Hartmann, a beatific light of imperturbability, skiing her way to a clinically winning run. " You ca n't worry, " said Hartmann, about any of the distractions -- the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " You just ski. " Indeed, all worries did seem to dissipate for the next morning 's race, because racing is simple : Just ski, and do so in a hurry. No judging to misscore the racing skill and instincts of Tamara McKinney, who matter-of-factly blew away the women 's field. From the starting corral, the competitors, both men and women, hung over the sponsors ' banners to watch in open awe as McKinney sped effortlessly from one gate to the next. " Man, she 's really hauling! " said one of the men, slack-jawed. It was something to see. No judging to misconstrue the obvious message on the men 's side : This was an event for pro racers to dominate. Mathias Berthold, Felix McGrath, Ove Nygren, and Jim Read -- pro racers all -- were the top four finishers. The mutual-admiration tables were turned ; Coombs was expressing his appreciation for the gate-crashing skills of Berthold and company. And, perhaps regrettably, there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the gates with the liquid and untroubled ease of butterscotch melting on a sundae. Wong finished dead last. A little butterscotch ought to go into the best all-around mix, do n't you think, but how in the world do you measure something like that? Thankfully, wackiness returned for the mogul event that afternoon. It began with -- what else -- a mercurial change in the weather, as the morning chill gave way to a sudden assault of spring warmth. In the morning the moguls of Catskinner had been, as Katie Harvey said, " a coral reef, " but by afternoon they resembled something more like a giant Slurpee. So who astonished the crowd with the nimble, quick-turning reflexes of a regular mogul-meister? Why, none other than speed skier Franz Weber, renowned for a hell-bent propensity not to turn. If he had n't got his quick feet briefly and ignobly bogged in the mush, he might have won the mogul event. How wacky is that? Or how about Meinhard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the photograph-still upper body, finishing fifth in the moguls( and seventh overall)? Taschl gave credence to an idea wholly far-fetched just a few days earlier : The world 's best all-around skiers do not necessarily have two arms. But really, how about that Steve Mahre? He 'd come to the mogul event inspired by an admirably off-the-wall ambition : He was going to pull off a helicopter, even if it killed him. Which it nearly did. A third of the way into his run, the erratically whirlybirding Mahre took off on a crash course with the retaining fence. Spectators fled ground zero like frightened deer. But he got his skis pointed downhill and managed to avoid the fence by inches. It must have reminded Wayne Wong of the crazy, early days of freestyle. Who would have thought : Steve Mahre, world 's best hot dog. And finally, there was Garcia, about to be crowned world technical champ( along with the ever-smiling Hartmann), but pouting over his score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the best skier in the world, " the pre-event press releases had called the championships. What a nobly hopeless endeavor! The best skier in the world is an elusive figment -- a phantom lost in the mists of a zillion differing opinions. You might as well launch a search for Superman or Morgan le Fay. Still, the World Technicals was a breath of fresh air in the world of skiing competition. This was indeed, as Wayne Wong said, like the early days of freestyle, before freestyle started taking itself too seriously. It was basically, as Mike Farny suggested, a showcase for brilliant skiers to show off, and what could be much better than that? Long live any forum in which Steve Mahre and Meinhard Taschl and Franz Weber and Noel Lyons and Tamara McKinney -- and whoever -- can break from established competitive reputations and demonstrate the unrevealed breadth of their talents. But a way of discovering the world 's best skier? Not a chance. That 's just a flat-out wacky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the world 's best skier without Alberto Tomba? Or Tommy Moe? Or other World Cup stars like Kjeti Andre Aamodt, Marc Girardelli, Breni Schneider, or Katja Seizinger? Without extreme stars Scot Schmidt or Glen Plake? Where were those guys? * Politics and money -- the twin movers and shakers of the modern world -- had a lot to do with the notable absence of many of the world 's top skiers at this year 's World Technicals. * The politics : The Federation Internationale de Ski( FIS), the controlling body of the World Cup, hinted strongly that racers who competed in the World Technicals, an event for which the FIS was not the sanctioning body, risked future World Cup eligibility. The one World Cup racer who had already been entered -- U.S. GS star Eva Twardokens -- promptly withdrew. * Beyond the sanctioning question was a second stumbling block, says World Technicals director Doug Perry. The FIS has a sour opinion of the World Technicals ' " factory team " format @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ski companies( Elan, K2, Rossignol, Salomon, etc.) that sponsor them. * The money : The Technicals offered no prize money. Instead, the organizers relied on the equipment sponsors to field( i.e., pay, compensate) their factory teams. Schmidt and Plake were absent because their ski sponsor, K2, chose to enter only three skiers. The company deemed Doug Coombs and Steve and Phil Mahre to " have the best chance of doing well in an event like this, " says president Tim Petrick( Phil was subsequently hurt in a water-skiing accident and did n't compete). Other top skiers were also left out by their sponsors. So money, or the lack of it, was responsible for the absence of World Cuppers and non-World Cuppers alike. * Perry hopes to eliminate these barriers for 1995. Bolstered by what most competitors and onlookers agreed was a successful first event with a promising future, Perry is actively pursuing FIS sanction, considering even the possibility of FIS oversight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens on that front, changes are in store for the World Technicals of 1995. One of the three technical-turning events( most competitors felt there were too many of these) will be replaced with what Perry calls " a real crowd-pleaser " -- an event incorporating big GS turns, moguls, and big air in one run. * The judging, and the understanding of the judging, should also be better. Perry concedes that the criteria may not have been fully understood, both by competitors and judges. As a result, each factory team will be supplied with a videotape for a visual explanation of the criteria, and the addition of pre-event " practice judging sessions " should help get judges and competitors on the same wavelength. <p>
