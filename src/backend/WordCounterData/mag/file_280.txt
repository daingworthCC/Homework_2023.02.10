2033641 Think of Mardi Gras as a great excuse to throw a New Orleans party-masks optional // While New Orleans may throw the ultimate Mardi Gras bashthis year, it 's on February 8-you can party along wherever you live. Here 's how to host your own Fat Tuesday buffet. Just remind your guests not to hold back : The excess ends at the stroke of midnight! Everything stops in New Orleans for Mardi Gras. Buses and streetcars do n't run, businesses are closed and the streets are clogged with revelers, many in costumes and masks. Some roam the city, often in family groups ; others gather to watch the parades and catch the tons of plastic beads that are tossed from the passing floats. Although the holiday is thoroughly secular today, its roots are religious : It 's based on the notion that the day before Ash Wednesday is the last chance to cut loose before Lent 's 40 days of abstinence. So Mardi Gras food is rich, flavorful and abundant, and everyone throws dietary caution to the wind. It is n't called Fat Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routes often host open houses to feed wandering friends. People arrive both energized and exhausted by the crowds, music and good-natured mayhem-and they 're starving. Tradition marks these gatherings : Mardi Gras menus are passed down for generations. And since the party goes on for hours, the food has to be make-ahead hardy and able to stand up to reheating. Almost everything here can be done in advance( the red beans and rice taste belter the next day anyway) and then laid out buffet style. The better to dig in.
