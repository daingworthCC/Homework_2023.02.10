4146541 Section : SKYLOG # In May the seven-star pattern Americans know as the Big Dipper hangs high in the north as darkness falls. In the United Kingdom this asterism( as such prominent patterns are called) is better known as the Plough. A once widespread British tradition was that the stars formed a wain, or farm wagon -- either Arthur 's " Wain( for King Arthur) or Charles 's Wain( for Charlemagne). In the seventh century BC, the poet Homer described it as a bear. Interestingly, many indigenous American peoples also knew these stars as a bear. Is that sheer coincidence, or did their ancestors bring the name with them when they crossed from Asia to North America thousands of years ago? # South of the Tropic of Capricorn( 23.5 degrees south latitude), however, the Big Dipper will be visible with difficulty, if at all. When I journeyed to Easter Island in 1986 to view Halley 's Comet, I found the asterism a most arresting sight, lying upside down just above the northern horizon. There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect. I 'm sure that everyone reading these words has experienced the Moon illusion at one time or another. When it s rising or setting, the Moon appears abnormally large ; when it s higher up in the firmament it looks noticeably smaller. Using the Big Dipper, you can observe another type of Moon illusion. Look at Dubhe and Merak, the so-called Pointer " stars, the two at the front end of the Dipper 's bowl -- the two that line up with the North Star. Try to imagine eleven full Moons lined up in the space between them. Maybe, you 'll think, one could squeeze four or five in, but eleven? And yet, in our sky, the Moon measures one-half degree across, while the Pointers are separated by five and a half degrees. So yes( as Goldilocks might say), eleven would fit " just right! " # TABLE # Bright things in the sky seem to look bigger than they really are. Artists know this, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's size in their paintings. # Interestingly, when the first Zeiss planetarium projectors were built in the 1920s, both the Sun and Moon were designed to subtend exactly one-half degree when projected on the hemispherical screen, commonly called a dome. But subjectively they appeared much too small compared with the actual Sun and Moon. So Zeiss technicians ended up doubling their size to make them appear more realistic, a practice that continues to this day. # MAY NIGHTS OUT # 1 Mercury has leaped into the evening sky. About 19 P.M. local daylight time, look low to the west-northwest horizon. This innermost planet is 10 degrees to the right and slightly lower than Aldebaran, the brightest star in Taurus, the Bull. As twilight deepens, take a look at Mercury with binoculars. Just 2 degrees to its right you may be able to spot the Pleiades. On the 7th, Mercury reaches its greatest elongation( angular separation from the Sun), but it is much brighter now and almost as high as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky is Venus, which reaches its peak as Evening Star in May. How soon after sunset -- or even before -- can you pick it out in the deepening blue? Telescopes reveal Venus swelling in diameter somewhat during the month while waning in its gibbous phase. For a few days centered on the 23rd, Venus sets about as late into the evening as it can get. # 3 The Moon is full at 11:42 P.M. eastern daylight time( EDT). # 5 Soon after 10 P.M. local daylight time, look for the newly risen Moon in the east-southeast and, about 6 degrees to its upper right, Saturn shining with a steady yellowish-white hue. # 7 Mercury arrives at its greatest eastern elongation, 21 degrees. # 9 Venus passes less than 2 degrees from the big star cluster M35, visible through binoculars at the feet of Gemini, the Twins. # 11 The Moon wanes to last quarter at 6:36 A.M. EDT. # 18 The Moon is new at 12:13 A.M. EDT. # 21 Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crescent Moon make for an eye-catching scene in the west-northwestern sky, with Venus to the upper right of the Moon. # 22 Saturn, now in the constellation Libra, the Scales, reaches opposition : that is, the planet is opposite the Sun in our sky. It is unusually bright because its rings are tilted 24 degrees toward us( the rings will reach their maximum tilt, 27 degrees, in 2017). The red star Antares, the brightest star in Scorpius, the Scorpion, is 10 degrees to the southeast. # 23 Standing high above the wide crescent Moon, and well away to the upper left of Venus, is Jupiter. The planet comes into sight as soon as the sky starts getting dark and remains beautifully placed for telescopic viewing at nightfall. # 25 The Moon waxes to first quarter at 1:19 P.M. EDT. #
