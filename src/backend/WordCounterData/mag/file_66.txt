2008141 What you should, and should n't, do when faced with the environmentally illiterate. // Dog poop. Pop cans. Trampled vegetation. Sometimes, especially when you stroll down a well-used trail, there are constant reminders that some people just do n't get it. But what if the offending act happens right in front of you? Say you spot a hiker gathering fistfuls of wildflowers, or cutting across switchbacks, or washing dishes in the lake. What 's a conscientious hiker like yourself to do? I ask this because outdoor etiquette has been on my mind of late. Despite my constant attention to the low-impact ethic. and my disgust for those who litter and befoul the wilderness, I was recently caught with my elbows on the table, so to speak. It 's an aberration on an otherwise clean rap sheet, but I confess : I let a friend 's kid feed a carrot to a deer. A few seconds later, a hiker who 'd witnessed the " crime " pounced on me like a cop after a speeding sports car. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presentation was all wrong. Instead of merely making me feel guilty about my actions, he launched into an agitated, finger-pointing, high-decibel condescension. Naturally, my first reaction was to become extremely defensive, and my second reaction was to consider slugging the guy. It was not a pretty scene. Later, after calming down and reflecting on the whole ugly incident, I wondered how I would have handled the situation if the hiking boot were on the other foot. Of the two choices you 're faced withspeaking up or shutting up-both have drawbacks. The first involves friction and the second, betrayal of principles. Outdoor experts acknowledge that this is tricky territory. In fact, everyone contacted for this article hesitated to encourage laypeople to take matters into their own hands. " There is no single right answer, " says Rich Brame, outreach and training manager for the National Outdoor Leadership School( NOLS) based in Lander, Wyoming. " Each situation is a. matter of education versus self-preservation. " Mark Forbes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northwest Region, agrees. " Hikers should ask themselves if it 's really worth the confrontation. " Even seasoned wilderness officials are warned to use their best judgment when approaching wayward backcountry users. Dispensing advice while wearing a uniform is one thing, Brame says, but correcting fellow hikers in the backcountry is another. Someone who 's your peer is more than likely to think, " Who the heck are you to tell me what to do? " If the other party 's misdeed has really riled your environmental conscience, as was the case for my fellow woodsman in the deer feeding episode, it 's easy to come off sounding like a pompous jerk. That 's when tempers can flare. For instance : In Montana 's Glacier National Park, hiker Steve Payne of Olympia, Washington, approached a couple who stood by while their son chased a young mountain goat. He suggested that since they were not in a petting zoo, the parents should control their child. " They were taken aback and told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at the time, " Payne reports. In Ocala National Forest, Florida, BACKPACKER Senior Editor Michele Morris was appalled when another boater asked those in her canoe to throw sandwiches overboard so some otters would stay in view. " I shot back that it 's irresponsible to feed wildlife, " she says. The other boaters went silent, " but my canoe mates glared at me for being so rude. " // Most backcountry bumblers can be reformed with a little tact and understanding. // The key issue, says Forbes, should always be, " Did you educate or alienate? " Education works best in an atmosphere of respect and cooperation. Alienation occurs when people are being lectured to and feel they must defend themselves. A better approach, according to George Wallace, associate professor of natural resources, recreation, and tourism at Colorado State University, is to rely on the " authority of the resource. " This technique, often employed by wilderness officials, deemphasizes regulations and focuses instead on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relaxed, respectful atmosphere by engaging in friendly chitchat before outlining " the changes that can be set in motion by a series of seemingly innocent acts, " says Wallace, who wrote a chapter about this subject for The Wilderness Ranger Training Module. So the hiker I encountered should have ambled up to me and commented on the weather. Then, keeping it low key, he might have said, " These guys sure are cute, are n't they? It 's tempting to feed ' em, but the problem is that then they get used to people. The next thing you know, they 're in the parking lots looking for food from people, drinking from puddles of antifreeze.... " Or something to that effect. Wallace says most wilderness users are concerned about their role in the outdoors, and usually change their behavior once they " understand how their actions affect the way nature operates. " Here are a few more points to remember : Everybody makes mistakes, so assume the best about others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Be aware of body language and tone of voice, both yours and theirs. Speak softly and respectfully and try to stand shoulder-to-shoulder rather than faceto-face. If approaching a group, pick out one person to chat with because it 's easier than dealing with a whole crew. Speak on behalf of " the resource, " rather than blaming. Mention the recommendations of the land management agency or wilderness advocates. A hiker who ignores the " Please stay off fragile meadows " sign is likely to obey it in the future if you casually say, " You might want to go a different way, because the park ranger told us the meadows are having a hard time recovering. " On the other hand, " Hey, stay on the trail! " will only elicit a defensive response and comments about " those #! % &*; tree huggers. " Back off if a situation becomes confrontational. If you 're unfortunate enough to bump into people who use the outdoors for illegal activities, revert to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do n't get involved. Get a physical description of the offenders, as well as the time and location of the incident, and report it to the appropriate land management agency. In the end, the most important thing you can do is lead by example. Pass along wilderness ethics by first influencing those within your own group. If everyone is humming the Leave No Trace tune, neighbors will surely begin to hear and do likewise.
