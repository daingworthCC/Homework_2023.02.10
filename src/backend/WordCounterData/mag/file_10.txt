2001841 // I look in the mirror &; say good-bye to my face. It 's 7:30, the morning of my plastic surgery. I 'm due at the does in an hour. When I first go to see him I say, " I like my face, not the effects of gravity. " I mean the downward drift of my features that seems to be inscribing the downward drift of my life. The doc 's name is Mark A. Erlich. He suggests a face-lift, an eye job, and a chin implant. I decline the implant, imagining infection or slippage. He reaches into the top drawer of his desk and tosses me a small rubber rectangle with a couple of holes punched out. I flex it, liking the feel. I ask about the holes, and he says that 's where, in time, tissue anchors the added part. Next, he takes a picture of my left profile. It appears on a computer screen. With an electronic stylus, he erases a fold of skin on my upper eyelid, a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extends from nose to chin and gives my mouth a puppet aspect. More erasing, and the loose flesh under my chin disappears, and then the chin itself is extended, becoming aligned with my forehead and nose. I take in the effect, and I 'm sold. In minutes, I 've shifted from opposing an invasion by a foreign object to accepting the melding of rubber and my flesh. The new position feels like one I 've weighed, although I have n't. " How much? " I ask. He says, " Twelve thousand dollars. " I have thought I would do this for a long time. I saved for it. My body is home, and surgery is home repair. You need a new roof and weather stripping, no one argues with you. I like looking in the mirror. It does n't hurt anyone. Vanity( the pleasure we take in our qualities, even our disavowal of vanity) is different from wanting flattery, which to me means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't, ca n't be. I like imagining cells engaged in beaverlike activity. I like thinking, period. It 's autoerotic, the mind being part of the body and thoughts, therefore, possessing a physical dimension. Thinking, masturbating, looking in the mirror-all encapsulating pleasures, happy narcissism. Let 's call this the self-care element. There 's something else : my impulse to negotiate life so much through the body. I deal with loss and disappointment by mobilizing the flesh-comforting it, training it-finding a way of reversing the passive position. It 's a defense with benign applications. When I look in the mirror and think, " Fine, " I can say, " Fuck you " to people who intimidate me. I can do that without the mirror, but the mirror helps if I wind up hurt. There 's a third, twisted piece in my head : a carping voice that says, " You need to be fixed. " At this point in life, though I still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because a I 'm my mother 's daughter, b I 'm female goods in a dick-driven market, and c I 'm human), I do n't allow it to make my decisions. I say, " Oh, it 's you again, " and I hunt for the trigger du jour. The truth is, I do n't hate my neurotic patterns, do n't wish them purged or myself normalized. As with my sexual kinks( pleasures concocted from the raw materials of sorrow and defeat), they remind me what I 'm made of, map my trajectories past helplessness. At all times, as I undergo the face-lift, I 'm juggling self-care, defense, and carping, trying to keep them straight, though to do so entirely is impossible. I want to be alert, especially, if the voice that picks on me assumes disproportionate weight. Sometimes it does, but I do n't forget the other motives, which have more sway these days in controlling the show. Erlich 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article on cosmetic surgery, interviewed a slew of doctors, studied their procedures, and watched an operation. She deemed Erlich warm, his fees moderate. I know a woman he 's worked on who looks terrific. I meet with her. We 're about the same age, with similar slim builds and Mediterranean skin. A year after her surgery, there are no visible scars, and her taut jawline seems an arrow to my future. She says she felt no pain after the operation and healed easily but that, a week or so later, she became depressed. She is n't sure why. I wonder if her fantasies of change exceeded what, in reality, a knife could effect-if that 's what depressed her. She reminds me again to hunt for my own devious wishes, lest I be left with them( like egg) on my face. Still, talking to her fortifies my inclination toward Erlich. I think I should research the operation further. After all, it involves blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm subjecting my body to incisions and trauma-is what I want to avoid. I do n't want facts in my way. I agree to have the lift in two weeks. I 'm moving fast. I want to take care of myself, yes, but there 's a trigger for the timing, the urgency. His name is Evan. I 've just been dumped, and the face-lift is part of a conversation I 'm having with him in my head. I 've known him a year, been involved half that time. It 's been a roller-coaster trip : closeness alternating with withdrawal on his part, a clearing of air leading to more intimacy and, inevitably, punishment for my being " too happy, " as he once put it. He did n't want me to expect affection to grow. He chose to end it by starting an affair with someone else. He asked me to stay with him, then changed his mind and wanted out. I was n't only done to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He appreciated my mind maybe more than anyone. But the disappointment was wretched. This happens a week before my fifty-second birthday. The night he confesses his affair, I 'm unaware that anything 's brewing and dress for the date. The face I see in the mirror must look okay, even pretty, because surgery is n't on my mind. Surgery had flitted in and out of my head while we were together, but his attraction to me drained some of the need. When he pulls out, I feel the rejection as a criticism of my flesh. It 's my pattern, although it was n't his complaint. But for me, the age in my face casts reproach, and my body, too, looks sad, as if the problem has been in me, my body, something that can be mended, though in reality there is nothing I can do. I say to Evan he ca n't call or see me, wanting to check my fantasies of resuming. The fantasies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature). Evan 's body is muscular and beautiful ; in my go-into-action mode, the face-lift is a way to level the playing field. I look in the mirror and say, " You 're not going to get me, " addressing everyone who 's ever broken my heart. I would postpone the surgery if I thought losing my boyfriend were its only fuel. It 's not, but briefly it gains inordinate weight. I tell everyone I 'm planning the lift. To hell with body police, whether zealots who oppose abortion rights or others who judge the desire for beauty to be mere social conformity. To hell with the idea that the changes over which we have no control, like aging, are acceptable, while changes we can influence -- through surgery, bodybuilding, and tattooing-are suspect. My friend John is the most negative, fearing pain and physical risk. He thinks I 'll be disappointed when the new face does n't conjure a new man. I say I 'm used to disappointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's reservations go into me or echo some of my own, because the day I pay Erlich, I feel deflated. What if I do die on the table? People will mutter : " Live by the mirror, die by the mirror. " Some friends are so enthusiastic, I feel stung. Do I need the work that badly? I imagine my face with years erased, musing on pictures of me when I was younger. At 25, wind whips my hair and I stare at the camera devoid of irony. At 40, my hair is cropped and bushy, and I look hopeful. After the lift, I 'm not going to lie about my age, but I like the thought of confounding people-as well as my own assumptions about 50. When I was 14, I 'd try to imagine myself in two power-laden years : 1984 and 2000. In ' 84, at 37, I 'd have duplicated my parents ' prickly marriage and predictable, family-centered existence. In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and look gray. As these thoughts would gather, my head would fill with fog and I 'd think : " Shoot me now. " Today, without children, I feel the body of 14. Perhaps, too, because I 'm childless and have no way to project myself physically into the future, nothing drains my desire to prolong youth. I want the face of 25 or of 40-but with the knowledge I 've gained since. By the morning of the operation, the aging in my face has assumed grotesque proportions. I am looking at myself as I imagine Evan did at his most unsympathetic-in other words, in my most carping way. On the subway, I reason that the new face will soon look like me, becoming etched, as it must, by my emotions and gestures. At the office, while Erlich marks me with crayons to guide his incisions, I banter jokingly. I 've signed forms informing me of a variety of rare but possible results, like asymmetry. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great, if I do n't die under anesthesia. " He says he has n't lost one yet. Photograph Row above : before surgery ; row below : ten days after surgery // We enter the operating room, next to his office, as casually as if going for coffee. As the sedative enters my veins, I slip below consciousness. The next thing I know, three hours have passed and Erlich is saying that everything 's fine and that I look great. My face is encircled with bandages, from the top of my head to my chin. My friend Esther, who has come to pick me up, is there cheering me, and the scene reminds me in a weird way of the triathlon races at which I 'd rooted for Evan. I believed in his body, and I believe in mine, in its ability to obey and contain me. I 'm looking forward to recovery as a space to be an animal, take a break from my mind. I 'm back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sit on the floor outside his office, awaiting his arrival. He dresses my incisions, removes two drains in the back of my head, and rewraps me. A few days later, with scarf and sunglasses, I ride the subway to his office, eliciting no stares, though, granted, there 's a lot of competition for attention down here. At no time during this period am I in pain. I feel discomfort, yes, soreness, tightness. I 'm a hardy beast, a fit athlete. I do n't smoke, do drugs, or drink much, so throw that in the hopper. But whatever has been said about pain and postsurgical disfigurement, it 's not my story. There are incompetent doctors. People die from anesthesia and other risks. It 's important to shop for an established surgeon and talk to her/his patients. Warnings serve consumers, but scare stories about cosmetic surgery, which proliferate in the media, are also fingers wagged at people-mainly women, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to be masochists for( a) conforming to superficial ideals and( b) electing suffering as the price for beauty. No one wants to look good merely because of social pressure. Attractiveness is fun ; it feels good. To our guilt -- seeking minds, it 's not possible to have fun and feel good without paying a dire price. In reality, it is. I 'm told I look pretty, revitalized, and younger than my years, but not necessarily younger than before. One friend thinks I appear more mature, the chin creating classical proportions and changing my previous " childlike look. " My friend Sandy-we 've gone through our life stages together-says she 's not thrilled by the prospect of seeing me look younger, thinking it will intensify her sense of having aged. I realize that, in my excitement, I have n't factored in this reaction from peers. In my desire to look younger, I 've forgotten that some people need the space to look the age they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss and desire is so long-standing and complex. For some, the freedom place is doing nothing. I 'm on the phone with another woman when she asks, " Do you want Evan to see you? " The question hits me in the stomach, so I know it 's true. Though I do n't want the relationship, I 'm secretly hoping that fixing my flesh will make him desire me again-so I can be let off the hook of being discarded. A male friend thinks I have erased time and, knowing that the women in Evan 's life have generally been in their twenties and early thirties, thinks I intended the lift to " wipe out the young girlfriends. " The shoe fits. A month has passed. Friends study my face, getting used to it, and I enjoy the attention. The dramas of getting over Evan and changing my face are done. I 've cleared the decks to write fiction and a long essay, and most days sit home feeling insecure about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ride the tension, playing with words and forgetting that what I put out will eventually be seen. Will my face change me, packaging seeping under the skin? I 'm satisfied for the moment. My looks are less on my mind than in a fair while, though a weird thing has happened : I forget that this face, like every other, changes each day, depending on sleep and emotions. Evan has n't seen me. I have n't rekindled his desire, and the whole deal of him has lost air. I do have the face, which in a way he inspired-my parting gift, me. I 'm still 52, still L. Stone with scary parts and no mate. I collect more looks from strangers these days : the mutual eye candy that makes theater of ordinary life, the pinball effect where things happen if you 're there to bounce against. The confidence is exhilarating. If I live long enough to age so much no surgeon can fix it, then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what all life is.
