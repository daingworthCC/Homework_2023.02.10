2004041 An icy Sierra wind lashed the Scouts of Troop 341 as they piled out of their warm van. The boys strapped on snowshoes and backpacks, grabbed their ski poles and tramped out into the crusted snow. Ahead of them lay six miles of deep snowfields, separating the Carson City, Nev., troop from their objective, the crest of 10,776-foot Mount Rose. Climbing the rugged peak, which towers over Lake Tahoe in nearby Washoe County, was just part of the troop 's larger plan. The boys wanted to scale the highest points in all 17 Nevada counties. So far they 'd sucNeeded 10 out of 11 times, So fall duringthe summer. Mount Rose, a winter climb, would teach them some useful lessons. Reaching one 's goals sometimes requires patience as well as determination, and safety always comes first. The Scouts would also discover that a little fun can wring the sting from defeat.

Instead, the Scouts found themselves struggling with the unfamiliar snowshoes. " It was pretty cold, " says 15-year-old Mike Reynolds, a Life Scout. " The climb was pretty tough. We had to take large steps so that we did n't walk on our snowshoes. But after a while we got used to it. " Using their ski poles to help avert rock dives, the Scouts fell into single file, taking turns breaking trail. The hard work and thin air kept chatter to a minimum. Photograph Photograph // A couple of miles and a couple of hours later, the trail turned steeper and the sun came out. Now the Scouts needed to consider a potential problem. Heat from the sun meant snowmelt, which can lubricate the undersides of snowfields, increasing the risk of avalanche. As the day warmed up, the guys walked farther apart and tied on brightly colored avalanche cords. In case the snow gave way, these light -- weight lines would ride its surface and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the troop hit an impasse. The steepening trail ahead rose at more than 35 degrees, making it dangerously prone to avalanche. Already they could feel the snow begin to shift beneath their feet. Because this was a day hike and afternoon shadows already were lengthening, there was no choice but to turn around. The snow was too deep to slide back down the mountain, as the boys had hoped, so 15-year-old Tyson Reed, a Life Scout, showed them how to improvise. Tyson just ran until his snowshoes got tangled up. " It was the best part of the hike, " he says. " Running down the Photograph Duke and Tyson, with Mike Reynolds in the middle, practice probing for avalanche victims.

" There 's really not much up there. Just a bunch of rocks and bushes and stuff. " The boys also went to work on the rest of their list, and by the end of summer, they had just two more of the 17 high points left to conquer : 11,387-foot Ruby Dome in Elko County, and 10,614 -- foot Diamond Peak in Eureka County. But the Scouts also were determined to make a winter climb of Mount Rose. So last March they once again headed back out into the cold. This time they planned on an overnight expedition, hefting 50-pound packs as they trudged up the trail. Familiar Location It was a little later in the season than their first attempt, and the snow was n't so deep. At 4 o'clock that afternoon, after seven hours of hiking, they bivouacked at the same spot where they 'd turned back one year before. With a brisk wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of noodles and broth with cider, then turned in, certain that with the break of day they would easily hike the final 800 vertical feet to the top. By dawn thick clouds had gathered, and a storm was howling over the mountain. Troop 341 's adult leaders guessed by the length and shape of the snow plume streaming off Mount Rose 's summit that the wind up there was blowing 50 to 60 miles an hour. With no sign the storm would let up soon, the boys headed back down the mountain once more. " It was discouraging, " Tyson Reed admits. " When you have to turn around it 's like Doh! " Sliding Into Home This time, it was Mike Reynolds 's turn to make lemonade out of lemons. Mike had lugged a snowboard along- " that was a pain, " he says-but now came his reward, miles of deep, untouched snow that Mike happily shredded most of the way to the bottom. " It was really worth it, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the 50-pound pack on my back. " Back in Carson City, the boys reflected on their two failed attempts and decided that a third try might be the charm. In the meantime, they scaled Ruby Dome and Diamond Peak, finally reaching their original goal. " We 're determined to make that winter climb, " says Tyson. " We 'll adjust, maybe bring enough stuff to stay an extra day. We know we ca n't control the weather. But we 'll probably keep trying until we get to the top. " That 'll be the most fun of all.

Sidebar Avalanche Fast Facts Sidebar 1) An avalanche can consist of rock, mud or dirt, but in English-speaking countries avalanche usually means a mass of snow in motion down a mountainside. 2) There are two basic types of avalanches, A loose snow avalanche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it flows down a mountainside. A slab avalanche occurs when a large mass of cohesive snow breaks loose all at once. Slab avalanches are the more dangerous. Sidebar 3) The worst avalanche in U.S. history occurred March 1, 1910, near Wellington, Wash. Two passenger trains, trapped by snow, were swept off the tracks by an avalanche that killed 96 people. 4) Periods of greatest avalanche danger occur during and immediately after big storms and high winds. 5) It an avalanche catches you, your best chance of survival is to " swim " as strongly as possible in order to stay on or near the surface. Sidebar 6) If an avalanche buries you, immediately cover your face to protect your nose and mouth and to create an air pocket that will allow you to breathe while your friends dig you out. You have an 80 percent chance of survival if your friends find you within the first few minutes. After one half hour. your chance of survival drops to 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along ridge tops.

Each also attended a snowshoeing clinic.
