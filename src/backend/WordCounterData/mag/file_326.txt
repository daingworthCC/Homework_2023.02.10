2039541 Elements of Design <p> As work is what chiefly defines an adult 's day, so play defines a child 's. For children, everything about the world is new. The work of their days is trying out the baffling and delightful plethora of possibilities that lies before them. Gardening is one of those, and children, watching their parents go about it, want to do it too. But what the child wants -- needs -- to do is not quite the same thing their parents are bent on achieving. Adults work in the garden to achieve a certain order, a pleasing patterning of plants, stone, carpenter 's work, water. The effort is directed to the making of something beautiful, which, once achieved, can be contemplated and enjoyed. But for children, what matters much more is experiencing the process, playing at the rituals and rhythms of gardening, doing things. The product, be it a bed of bright annuals, a bountiful crop of tomatoes, or a towering delphinium, is less immediately the point. Or rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the process that brought such results into being. The work itself is initially the point, work that the child perceives as play, albeit very serious play, as all true play is. Having done one thing, the child wants to do another, and after that another still. Everything is process, change, experiment. <p> I have a friend of many years who began gardening at the age of three. He was given by his grandmother a single rhizome of bearded iris. It was a pet iris, really, which he delighted in moving around the garden on an almost daily basis. Finally it came to rest in a tunnel of an overgrown privet hedge, a secret hiding place just big enough for him and for his companionable iris. <p> The grandmother of this child( now, in his maturity, a distinguished gardener) must have been keenly observant, both about gardening and the ways of children. For few other plants would have stood such treatment, and such treatment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child. The iris never bloomed ; neither did it die outright, at least not until the child finally abandoned it in its privet gloom to turn to other pursuits. It survived long enough to provide his first lesson in gardening -- that plants are gentle, patient things that mostly will not hurt you, and that will, with an increase of knowledge and expertise, give abundant satisfaction, none better than a special sort of companionship. <p> As much as they like to move things about, children like to make messes. For them, there is a keen sensual pleasure in playing in the dirt. Making mud, discovering all the wonderful creepy things that live in the earth, digging holes and poking things into them -- these are a large part of what makes working in the garden fun on a Saturday morning. What for adult gardeners may be merely labor necessary to achieve results is for the child often the greatest part of the pleasure. Pity the young gardener who is not allowed to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whose jeans at midday must look still crisp from the laundry. For children are much closer to the dirt than are adults, almost to the point( as parents know) of thinking of it as their natural element. So it is that the true gardener 's life -- as all life did, we are told -- begins in a magical combination of earth and water, a mess. <p> Because children go at gardening with purposes different from those of adults, it is probably best to give them their own plot to work in. There they can do pretty much as they please -- with gentle guidance -- never disturbing the plan of the garden as a whole or the adult 's wishes for it. And nothing, really, is nicer for both parent and child than providing the child with his or her own separate space to garden, fenced or hedged perhaps. Such a sequestered space gives the child two emotional commodities precious to all children -- privacy and a sense of unfettered ownership, of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results will further the concern all adults must have who are entrusted with the care of children, that they be given early the equipment essential to becoming adults in their own time. <p> This is not to say, of course, that the child 's first efforts at gardening should occur in a sort of backyard Siberia. For though giving children their own place to garden is the first part of the education of a gardener, it is just as important to garden with them. In the beginning, the child 's whole sense of gardening will be to emulate what you are doing. If you are growing vegetables, the child will want to grow them too. If there is a trellis in your garden, there had best be one in the child 's garden also. If you have a wheelbarrow or a compost bin, then child-size versions of these may very well be required. Conversely, if your whole sense of gardening is cutting the grass, your child will be no more sophisticated and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably quicker. Nothing requires greater tact than varying the tasks of the garden according to the child 's waxing or waning interest. And most certainly the last way to involve children in gardening is to see them as free labor, or to set them to tasks beyond their patience in the mistaken notion that it will develop character. More likely, you will develop boredom instead and give them a lifelong aversion to gardening itself. <p> Generally the hardest part of gardening for children is the patience it requires. The ability to anticipate the future is essential to growing plants. Even the simple radish needs its 30 days to produce the miracle of its fat, red, edible ball. Other flowers and vegetables take much longer ; trees and shrubs longer still. Children have a different sense of time than do adults, and the ability to see past, present, and future in a single plant, though it comes to be one of the deepest pleasures of gardening, is largely closed to them. For them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives, and next year is an almost incomprehensible concept. Literally, they can not wait. So if their interest in gardening is slow to grow, things need to happen rather fast. And sometimes a little tactful deceit on the part of the parents is just what is needed. My sister, when she was a very young girl, fell in love with watermelons. She liked eating them, of course, and spitting the seeds at me. But it was really their satisfying shapes that won her, as big as she and much too heavy to carry. So my parents made her a bed beside the roses, and together they planted a hill with watermelons. The seed sprouted quickly, and the vines grew rampantly in the heat of the south Jersey summer. But the fruits were months away when her impatience turned first to frustration and then to indifference. It was at that point that my father intervened one early morning, sneaking in not one but three huge melons from the local fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for life on the joys of gardening. <p> It is, I suppose, always easy for adults to condescend to children, to assume that because they are small and young, they are incapable of subtlety and discrimination. Adults always seem to assume that children will want to grow only what is big and brightly colored and odd -- sunflowers, cabbage trees, luffa gourds, marigolds, zinnias, and fire-engine red geraniums. Children will, of course, delight in these plants, which are all excellent and joyful in their way, and as new to them as most else is. But they might enjoy as much the fragrance of a rose, the intricate geometry of an agave, the hidden beauty of the codonopsis bells that must be gently lifted up to peer into. In the long run, much is gained by sharing with children not only the simpler beauties of flowers, but also their complexity, an appreciation of which provides the enduring pleasure of gardening a whole life long. For the joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to be put away when more sophisticated pleasures come with the advance of years. And the surest way to understand a child 's interest in gardening is to look deeply into one 's own. Adults also need their secret places, their private havens from the world, their pride of possession. Come spring, plunging one 's hands in the moist earth is good at any age, a positive longing, an appetite in itself. Worms are always to be greeted with pleasure and slugs with an ugh of disgust. A flower that opens for the first time from seed we sow is as thrilling at 60 as it was at six. Gardening successfully with children gives them a gift, and a solace, that will last longer than any other we can provide them. But it also reminds us of why we started in the first place, why it matters, and why, once we are past childhood in a chronological sense, we still do it. <p> PHOTO : Setting simple, manageable tasks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too fine, is the best way to keep their enthusiasm from flagging.( KAREN BUSSOLINI/POSITIVE IMAGES) <p> PHOTO : Sharing garden cores with parents gives children the sense that working in the garden is not only fun but important.( MICHAEL S.
