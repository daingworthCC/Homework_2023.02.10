4151941 POST-ITS # Craft Magic # Make spectacular sun art with autumn leaves, flowers, and ferns. All you need for this fun nature project is light-sensitive paper from a craft store plus fall foliage with interesting shapes from your yard or a park. On a sunny day, arrange items on paper in creative designs. Place in bright sunlight. Wait five minutes, and then remove items. Sun-exposed paper will turn a pretty dark blue, and covered parts will stay white. To set colors, place paper in pan of water for about five minutes( check instructions on package). Remove from water and place print right side up on newspaper until dry. Frame and display solo or in groups. # For a bonus project, go to **35;4978;TOOLONG #
