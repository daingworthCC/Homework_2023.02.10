4108441 I wish I were one of those people who could decide on a Monday that I want to take a week 's vacation starting Thursday, find a cheap airfare, then jet off to Barcelona or Vegas or Jackson Hole. But I 'm not one of those people. I 'm one part planner, one part opportunist. <p> The planner : At the start of the year, I set aside time for at least one fishing-and-hiking getaway and at least one vacation to a city or a place with good cocktails and beaches. I know from experience that if you do n't commit to taking breaks and blocking out your calendar, little obstacles will always creep in. Suddenly a new year arrives and you 're still dreaming of getting away " someday. " But life is short, your work is n't your whole life, and some of the best memories are made by traveling. <p> The opportunist : When a friend invites me to take a quick weekend to Carmel, or work beckons me to a distant part of the West, I say Yes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound scary. Canyoneering in Utah? Turned out to be the trip of a lifetime with my daughter. Winter fly-fishing in Aspen? Loved it and made new friends. <p> Whether I have a year to plan or a few weeks, the buildup to travel makes me savor it even more. Spontaneity has its own rewards, but holding the dream in your head a bit before you go gives it added sweetness. <p> This month, we 've devoted the magazine to travel, and we hope you 'll find inspiration for your dream trip. Budget-friend Iy weekend? We 've got that. Life-changing escape into nature? That 's in here too. This summer, take a trip from this issue and tell me about the memories you make.
