2040341 Headnote What 39,090 patients and 335 doctors have to say about how to make the most of your next appointment // Sure, you love your doctors. But your visits to them might he more rushed than you realize, and you might not be following their instructions as well as you think you are. Those are some of the findings of the Consumer Reports National Research Center 's survey of 39,090 patients about their doctor visits. We also asked 335 primary-care physicians about how things look from the other side of the exam table. More findings : * The overwhelming majority of patients said they were highly satisfied with their doctors and got better under their care. These are among the highest ratings of any services we 've evaluated. * Almost one-third of the doctors failed to discuss side effects of prescribed drugs, and two-thirds never brought up costs of treatments and tests, patients said. * Patients stuck with uncommunicative doctors got much better results when they took active steps such as taking a friend or relative along on the visit or asking doctors directly about their experience treating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked them at least occasionally to prescribe drugs they had seen advertised on television, and 67 percent said they sometimes did so. * Doctors think the health-care system works much better for drug and healthinsurance companies than for primarycare doctors and their patients. Our survey had three parts. We asked 25,184 respondents to our 2006 Annual Questionnaire about visiting the doctor for treatment of their most bothersome illness. Over the summer of 2006, we asked 13,906 online subscribers to tell us about their preventive-care visits.( Our subscribers might not be representative of the population as a whole.) And in May 2006. we surveyed a random sample of 335 primary-care physicians drawn from a national panel. We have used our survey findings, a review of the latest research on patient care, and interviews with experts to construct this guide to making your relationship with your physician the best it can he. starting with how to find a doctor in the first place. Before your appointment Get a referral. Try to avoid picking a doctor at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone hook. In our survey, people who found their physicians through someone they trusted-a friend, a family member, or another doctor-had the most favorable experiences.( We found a similar phenomenon in a 2004 survey of consumers who visited mentalhealth professionals.) If you 're picking a doctor to care for a specific condition, ask about how often he or she treats cases similar to yours. Patients we surveyed who took this step were more satisfied with their care. You can also ask the doctor about specialty board certification, which requires advanced training and the passing of rigorous tests.

The Internet has given consumers almost limitless sources of information on their medical conditions. But 41 percent of doctors said their patients often showed up poorly informed because of bad information found online. If you research your condition online, as almost 40 percent of respondents did, take care to assess the site 's credibility before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust : MayoClinic.com( www.mayoclinic.com) and the National Institutes of Health( www.nih. gov). Both rated excellent for reliability and quality of information in a review by Consumer Reports WebWatch, a project of Consumers Union, the nonprofit publisher of this magazine, and the Health Improvement Institute.( For more help with evaluating health Web sites, go to www.healthratings.org.) But do n't bring reams of printouts to your appointment, because the doctor wo n't have time to read them. Instead, highlight pertinent sections, such as a summary of a new drug or treatment you want to discuss or a diagnostic test the doctor had n't mentioned. If something about your diagnosis or treatment remains unclear at the end of your appointment, ask the doctor to suggest sources for more information. Prepare an agenda. The average patient gets 10 to 20 minutes with the doctor, according to national physician surveys and direct studies of patient visits. More than half of the doctors we surveyed said they had to see many more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same income and that on some days they saw too many patients to spend adequate time with each.( Patients might not be aware of that fact ; only 9 percent of our respondents said they felt rushed through their visit.) Deciding ahead of time which things you most need to discuss can make the most of your limited time. Almost half of our readers brought a written list of questions and concerns to their doctor visits. Prioritize the three or four issues you most want to talk about, and bring those up first. If you do n't have time to get through the whole list, ask whether you can follow up with e-mail. A survey by the Center for Studying Health System Change found that 24 percent of U.S. doctors now exchange e-mail with patients. During your appointment Do n't go alone. Of all the patient behaviors we asked about, taking a friend, spouse, or other family member along to the appointment most strongly correlated with overall satisfaction with one 's doctor A second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to get out of the visit, remind you to bring up things you might have forgotten, and add information and create a more interactive dialogue with the physician. Having the person take notes during the visit frees you to concentrate on what the doctor is saying at the moment. " It may be that having a second person in the room causes the doctor to take the patient more seriously or try a little harder, " said Kate Lorig, R.N., Dr.P.H., a professor at the Patient Education Research Center at Stanford University School of Medicine, who studies patient-physician communication. Consider recruiting someone more assertive or knowledgeable about your condition than you are, which might help you to raise points that you otherwise would n't. Speak frankly. One-third of doctors in our survey said that they often encounter patients who are reluctant or embarrassed to talk about their symptoms.( For expert answers to 10 embarrassing health questions, see page 38.) That makes the doctor 's job a lot harder, said Howard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of Rochester who has done extensive research on doctor-patient interactions. Nor can you always count on doctors to ask the right questions. Of patients who said their preventive-care doctors were aware of their emotional stress, only 26 percent said it was because the doctors had asked them directly about it. Not only should your doctor know what symptoms are bothering you, but " patients should also be as honest as possible about what they think may be causing the problem, " Beckman said. If you fear your headaches indicate a brain tumor or an impending aneurysm. sharing those concerns could help. If the things you fear are outside the realm of possibility, the doctor can tell you so and save you a lot of stress ; if not, voicing your gut instincts may lead to tests the doctor otherwise might not have ordered, and even a lifesaving early diagnosis. Speaking up extends to asking for things you want from the doctor. In a study of patient visits with 45 physicians, patients who left with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment, or a different medication were unhappier with their doctor and recovered more slowly than patients who made their desires known. Physicians, too. rated those encounters as more demanding. Ignore drug ads. There 's another party in the examination room with you and your doctor : the pharmaceutical industry, which spends billions of dollars a year trying to get you to pester your doctor for expensive new brand-name drugs-and wining and dining doctors so that they 'll prescribe them. Almost all the doctors we surveyed said they make at least some time to meet with pharmaceutical company representatives who arrive bearing free samples, gifts, and sales pitches for their drugs. Twenty-two percent of physicians we surveyed said they field " I saw it on TV " requests quite often in a typical week. Patients most frequently ask about drugs for acid reflux, impotence, allergies, and insomnia -mainstays of the television ad lineups. Very few of the patients we surveyed-7 percent-admitted to asking for advertised drugs for their most bothersome health condition over the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with insomnia or impotence. Forty-nine percent of patients who asked for a specific drug left the doctor 's office with the prescription they requested. If you 're tempted to ask for a drug you saw advertised, do n't be offended if your doctor declines to prescribe it, as 54 percent of our surveyed physicians said they sometimes did.( Forty percent of doctors also said that advertising directly to consumers did not serve the public interest.) Older drugs can be just as effective, have a longer safety record, and often cost less. The new drug might not be on your health plan 's list of approved medications ; 60 percent of the doctors we surveyed complained about such restrictions. Thirty-one percent of respondents who got prescriptions said their doctor did n't adequately explain possible side effects, so be sure to ask about them. And 9 percent said their doctor did n't review their other prescriptions to check for potentially harmful interactions with the new drug.

Nowhere in our surveys did doctors ' and patients ' perceptions diverge more than on how well patients followed their prescribed course of treatment. Patients almost unanimously said they " completely " or " mostly " followed their doctor 's medical advice. But 59 percent of doctors said their patients often fail to adhere to the prescribed course of treatment. In fact, patient nonadherence ranked first among the troublesome patient behaviors we asked doctors about. However good patients ' intentions, a vast body of scientific evidence says the doctors are closer to the mark. If anything, physicians dramatically overestimate patient compliance, especially with medications, " says Ira S, Ockene, M.D., professor and director of the Preventive Cardiology Program at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Studies show that as many as 75 percent of patients fail to take medications as prescribed, for reasons including forgetfulness and lack of explanation from the doctor of the medication 's benefits and side effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within one year ; some never fill the prescription in the first place. The penalty for nonadherence is real. In our survey, large majorities of patients who conscientiously followed their doctors ' advice on lifestyle changes such as weight management and quitting smoking reported " good " or " excellent " improvement in their health, while only a minority of patients who ignored doctors ' advice felt better. If your doctor prescribes medication, take it exactly as instructed. Do n't stop any medication, even if it 's causing side effects, without consulting the doctor. Strategies that might help you stick to your drug regimen, especially if you take multiple drugs, include keeping a written schedule posted prominently in your home and the use of prefilled pillboxes. But if you have n't followed medication instructions, fess up to your doctor Not doing so could get you into trouble. For example, your doctor might increase your dose of a blood-pressure medication under the impression that the original dose did n't work, leading to a potentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most dissatisfied patients we surveyed were those in the worst physical or emotional health. These patients were particularly unlikely to feel that their doctors communicated well or cared about knowing them as people. Among them were patients with poorly understood and difficult-to-treat ailments such as chronic fatigue, irritable bowel syndrome, or recurring headaches. They were more likely to have switched doctors at least once in the past year. Such conditions frustrate physicians, too. " We went into medicine to fix things, " said Sharon Levine, M.D., who helps oversee 6,000 doctors as associate executive director of the Permanente Medical Group of Northern California. In a 2005 Consumer Reports National Research Center survey of readers ' use of alternative medicine, people who had the least luck with conventional treatmentsincluding those with fibromyalgia, low-back pain, and neck pain-were the most likely to report relief from therapies such as massage and chiropractic treatment. " In the absence of good treatment, what patients are looking for is time and understanding, " said Beckman. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative medical care. If you suffer from a chronic, hard-totreat condition, talk with your doctor about whether complementary therapies might be worth trying. Marilyn Bellezzo, 55, of Glen Ellyn, Ill., did just that. Plagued for 17 years with crippling stomach pains and diarrhea from irritable bowel syndrome. Bellezzo went through four specialists, two internists and at least 10 different medications in her quest for relief. " They would just run out of answers for me, " she said. In 2000, with her gastroenterologist 's blessing, she tried an intensive five-part, 100-day audio hypnotherapy program recommended by several fellow sufferers. " It was subtle at first, " she said. " Then over time the symptoms diminished substantially. " Today Bellezzo 's condition is " 95 to 98 percent " under control. But do n't abandon any of your current treatments without first consulting your doctor. Also check with him or her before trying any new herbal or dietary supplement : They can interact with numerous medications or have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to. Seven percent of respondents to our annual questionnaires had switched doctors. Their top reasons for doing so included feeling rushed during visits, feeling the doctor did n't listen, and not trusting the doctor 's technical competence. Determining why you want a new doctor can help shape what you should look for in a new one. If it takes too long to get an appointment, look for a practice that offers open-access scheduling, in which doctors typically leave part of each day 's schedule unbooked so that they can offer some same-day appointments. If your visits feel rushed, look for doctors who encourage e-mail communication to address nonemergency matters such as a question about a drug dose or minor symptom. If you just do n't click with your current doctor, consider your particular needs and preferences and what might fit them better. For example, our survey and other research suggest that female patients may have slightly more satisfactory experiences with female doctors. If you have a strong interest in nondrug or alternative treatments, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an approach that combines complementary and traditional therapies. Sidebar PROACTIVE PATIENT Marilyn Bellezzo, 55. of Glen Ellyn, 111., went through six doctors and ID medications for her chronic irritable bowel syndrome before she found a physician willing to fully collaborate with her. With his blessing, she finally obtained relief from an alternative treatment. Our survey found that patients like Bellezzo, who actively sought out the best care, had better overall results. Sidebar 10-minute checklist Your time with your doctor can be as little as 10 minutes per visit, studies show. Ask the questions below to help you make the most of it. " Your doctor should be receptive to the right kinds of questions, " says Beth Nash, M.D., who evaluates best treatments for the BMJ Group, publisher of the British Medical Journal. " If not, then you should think about finding a different doctor. " YOUR AILMENT * What is my exact diagnosis? What 's the cause of my problem? * How long will I be sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Under what conditions should I call you or come back?( Do n't feel better in a week? Coughing does n't stop? Pain becomes worse or spreads?) TESTS * Why is this test necessary? What will it tell us that we do n't already know? * Will the results significantly alter any treatment plans? * When will the results be ready? Should I call you for them, or will you catl me? TREATMENTS * What treatments are used for my condition? Which is best for me, and why? * What does the research show about this treatment? * Is there any research on the horizon about treatments for my condition? * What can I expect from this treatment, based on your experience? * What are the side effects of this medication? Will it interact with alcohol, caffeine, or other drugs or supplements I take? * Are there any alternative treatments appropriate for me to try, either before or along with conventional treatment?
