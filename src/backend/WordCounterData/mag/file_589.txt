4139441 Amid all the noise of the campaign, here is the truth about this presidency # Never has it been easier to lie outrageously and get away with it. Never has it been easier to disseminate the lies, and never have so many lies had such vast constituencies, utterly convinced of their truth. Some of the lies are easily dispelled. Is Barack Obama an American, eligible to be president? Well, if Hawaii was a state in August of 1961, then yes, Barack Obama is an American, eligible to be president. Is Mitt Romney responsible for the death of a former steel worker 's wife from a cancer diagnosed years after the steel-worker lost his job and health insurance? Well, no. Period. Mitt Romney did not kill Joe Soptic 's wife, and it is outrageous to say so. # The easy and obvious lies are not the problem. It 's the other lies, often based on something grounded in reality and exaggerated beyond recognition -- a data point or statistic, say -- that are far more pernicious. These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own free-floating islands of truth. These lies always find refuge on the Internet, where they are staunchly defended and protected, impervious to the truth. # Here, as a service to clarity and sanity, is the story of the Obama administration in raw, irreducible numbers. The unspun numbers sometimes benefit the administration, and sometimes they do not, but they always act as a corrective to the serial crimes against the truth that are playing out daily in the ongoing election fight -- served up by the White House, the campaigns, the billionaires and their unaccountable super-PAC money, a million screaming blogs, and the unholy propaganda machine that is Fox News. # Enjoy. # STIMULUS/FINANCIAL CRISIS # It is impossible to overstate the depth of the disaster that Barack Obama inherited the day in January 2009 when he put his hand on the Bible, mangled his oath of office, and became the unluckiest man ever to assume the title of President of the United States. The U. S. economy was hemorrhaging jobs -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would lose 4.2 million more over the course of that year. Add to that the 3.6 million jobs lost in 2008, with unemployment expected to continue to rise as far into the future as anyone could see, and the American economy was in free fall. Economists were looking at a $2 trillion " output gap "( FIG. A) between where the gross domestic product should have been and where it actually would be. And over the previous eight years, the federal government had added more than $2 trillion to the gross national debt, which is noteworthy considering we had a Republican president who began with a budget surplus and, for six of those eight years, a Republican-led Congress claiming to be deeply committed to fiscal restraint. # And so, at the height of his personal popularity, with more political capital than he would ever subsequently enjoy, this is what Obama did( FIG. B). And the same Republican leaders who had spent the previous eight years enacting $2 trillion in tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to rein in spending. They voted in lockstep against the stimulus package, even as some would go on to take credit for those spending projects back in their states and districts. # SOURCE KEY : Bureau of Economic Analysis( BEA) ; Bureau of Labor Statistics( BLS) ; Center for Automotive Research( CAR) ; Congressional Budget Office( CBO) ; Department of Defense( DOD) ; Department of Health and Human Services( HHS) ; Department of the Treasury ; Energy Information Administration( EIA) ; Families USA( FUSA) ; Gallup ; Office of Management and Budget( OMB) ; Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board( RATB) ; Tax Policy Center( TPC). # The truth of the matter is that, as I 've said, we 've created 4.3 million jobs over the last 27 months, over 800,000 just this year alone.

A few weeks before Obama assumed office, a report issued by his incoming economic team projected that should Congress pass the president-elect 's stimulus plan, unemployment likely would not exceed 8 percent, and that failure to pass the stimulus bill could see unemployment reach as high as 11 percent. But even with the plan in place, unemployment reached a 26-year high of 10 percent before settling in just above 8 percent, where it has stubbornly remained.

Insurance companies, for their part, ca n't refuse you coverage if you 're already sick. That, more or less, is what we 're talking about with both Mitt Romney 's health-care reforms in Massachusetts and Barack Obama 's near-identical scaling-up at the national level, and when broken down thusly, you realize that the high drama surrounding the passage of the Affordable Care Act has not so much to do with sickness or health.

In the fall of 2008 and winter of 2009, the Treasury Department made emergency loans to General Motors, Chrysler, and Ally Financial( formerly GMAC). For years, those companies had been plagued by falling sales and crippling debt, and many experts( auto executives and government economists, Democrats and Republicans) feared that they could not survive without help. A standard talking point against intervention -- to let the companies declare bankruptcy and undergo restructuring -- ignores two facts : Nobody at the time was willing to loan those companies any more money, and bankruptcy would have rattled the markets and shaken an already devastated economy. # AUTO JOBS 355,900 # The number of jobs lost in manufacturing and retail in all of 2008. # 102,600 # The number of jobs lost in manufacturing and retail from January 2009 to May 2009. # 239,300 # The number of jobs added in manufacturing and retail, as well as dealer sectors, from June 2009 to June 2012. # 1.414 MILLION # The number of jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2009 and 2010.

That estimate, however, leaves out much of the spending in 2009, crediting it to the previous administration. The 2009 budget was signed by President Bush, though President Obama added to it with emergency measures early in his term.
