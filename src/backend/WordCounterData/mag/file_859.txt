5005841 <h> SunnyOh <p> Several emerging market central banks have started to run down their reserves, prompting investors to contemplate whether Treasurys will take a deeper hit if this historically important group of market participants begins to more aggressively sell their holdings of U.S. government debt. <p> Argentina and Turkey have already drawn down their stockpile of foreign-exchange reserves, much of it comprising of U.S. government paper, to stem the pressure on their currencies. Meanwhile, Russia has reportedly liquidated most of its Treasurys as retaliation against U.S. sanctions. <p> Yet, the selling from emerging market economies has n't done much to move the bond market so far, with the 10-year Treasury note yield <p> " What you see during periods where emerging markets are getting into trouble and having to sell some of their reserves is that global risk appetite is off. There 's plenty of people who want to buy Treasurys, " said Arvind Rajan, head of global and macro at PGIM Fixed Income. <p> But other analysts note that emerging market central banks have historically served as an important source of demand for the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precrisis heyday, they say the role of emerging-market central banks as a price-insensitive buyer have helped to hold down bond yields against a rising U.S. government budget deficits that will result in a deluge of supply. <p> According to Oxford Economics, emerging-market buyers snapped up 30% of new Treasury supply during the four years after 2004, and 15% of the new supply in the five years after 2009. <p> Some analysts think that waning emerging-market demand could make a difference as other sources of demand also potentially dry up. <p> Once crowded out by the European Central Bank 's bond-buying program, European money managers will now return back to their domestic debt markets as European yields perk up, said Guillermo de Tolosa, an economic adviser at Oxford Economics. <p> " Going forward, the U.S. is going to face an increasingly limited global demand to meet their increased supply of securities and potentially larger sales from emerging markets, " he said. <p> In the last few months, central banks in developing market nations have stepped back. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around $30 billion in June. India, Mexico, Thailand and Taiwan also trimmed their holdings but not to the same extent. <p> This comes as emerging market currencies have sold off. The MSCI emerging market currencies index is on track to notch its sixth consecutive monthly decline from April. The Turkish lira TRYUSD, -0.4990% and the Argentina peso ARSUSD, +0.009041% are both down more than 40% against the dollar this year, FactSet data shows. <p> To be sure, it 's the less significant emerging market economies who are shedding their foreign exchange reserves. The Treasury holdings of Turkey, Russia and Argentina even at their peak represented a sliver of overall issuance of U.S. government paper. <p> " The countries that are currently in trouble, simply do n't have enough reserves to matter, " said Rajan. <p> Yet Tolosa says the bond market has, in fact, felt the tremors from the pullback of EM central banks. He points to how the 10-year yield rose 20 basis points between April and May, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between March and May, according to Treasury Department data. <p> Rajan says history shows when larger emerging-market central banks like the People 's Bank of China have slashed their holdings, the depth of the Treasury market and its role as a risk-free asset for global financial markets ensured U.S. government paper held up. <p> In 2015, China shed more than $300 billion of Treasurys in a bid to fight off currency speculators who bet the yuan would swoon amid a stock market collapse and slowing economic momentum. Yet Beijing 's move to arrest the currency 's decline did n't prevent the 10-year Treasury yield from sliding to a record low of 1.38% later in July 2016. <p> " Global demand for risk-free assets tend to easily compensate for such selling, " said Rajan. <p> Providing critical information for the U.S. trading day.
