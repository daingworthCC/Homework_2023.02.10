2008341 Bargain-Hunter 's Special In this world of increasingly high-tech -- and expensive-stoves, there remains a bargain-basement burner that works well and will set you back just $30 : the Camping Gaz Twister HPZ. This sturdy stove took top honors in our August 2000 canister stove review. Fast And Light What do you say about a stove like the $64 Snow Peak GigaPower, Auto( " Editors ' Choice ' 99. " April 1999) that cranks out heat. simmers like a champ, is indestructible, yet weighs just 3 ounces and could hide in your fist? " I want one. " Built To Last Optimus Svea owners use it for decades, then bequeath it to their heirs. Embracing the dictum " if it ai n't broke, do n't fix it, " the venerable Svea( $70) will last a lifetime, or two. Winter Warrior We would no sooner head into the backcountry in winter without a Mountain Safety Research XGK Expedition( $110) than without a super-warm sleeping bag. Not only does it burn virtually any liquid fuel, it fires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If It Ai n't Broke "( Mav 1998) for more details. All-Conditions Champ The X series stoves from Coleman Exponent( formerly Peak 1) -the Xtreme, Xpert, and two-burner Xpedition( $60 to $90) -overcome the classic bugaboos of canister stovE they burn well in freezing temps and windy conditions-an incredible marriage of versatility and simplicity( " Editors ' Choice ' 97, " April 1997). Plus, the canisters are recyclable. Any Fuel, Anywhere Canister fuels are convenient in warm weather, white gas performs in strong winds and cold, and multiple-fuel stoves are ideal for adventuring overseas. The Primus Multi-Fuel( " The Chosen Few, " April 1998) was the first to burn them all( $99). FUEL The first step in narrowing your choice of stoves is deciding on fuel type. Canisters contain a pressurized blend of fuels like propane, butane, isobutane, and isopropane that is released as a gas. Canister stoves are much simpler and quieter than liquid-fuel stoves, have precise flame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fraction of the bulk and weight of a liquid-fuel burner. Negatives include a severely diminished flame in freezing temps and strong winds, and a decrease in flame intensity as the canister empties. It uses more expensive fuel, few canisters are recyclable, and none, at this writing, are refillable. Most liquid-fuel stoves link via a fuel line to a refillable fuel bottle that must be pumped to pressurize the fuel for use. Most also require priming, or preheating. Liquid-fuel stoves demand varying degrees of assembly and periodic maintenance. While they are bulkier, heavier, and less convenient than canister stoves, they stand up better to strong winds and cold weather. Models that burn multiple fuels, like white gas, kerosene, and auto gas, are valuable when traveling overseas. Liquid fuel is lighter than canisters for long trips with infrequent opportunities to refuel, and it offers you the flexibility of packing the amount you need in fuel bottles of various sizes. The stoves listed in the charts and reviews use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are times when the ability to take apart and fix a malfunctioning stove in the field is more valuable than any other trait. Now with a self-cleaning shaker jet, the Mountain Safety Research WhisperLite( $60) continues to raise the bar, though given the stove 's proven durability, you may wait a long, long time before you experience how easy it is to disassemble. Super Simmerer Years ago, when liquid-fuel stoves had just two settings-fla meth rower and off-the Coleman Exponent( formerly Peak 1) Apex II became the first of its kind to offer precise flame control. It still simmers as well as any competitor, and at a very reasonable price( $65). Auto gas( AG). Use this for a multifuel stove only when cleaner, more refined fuels like white gas or kerosene are unavailable. Choose the lowest-octane unleaded available. Alcohol( AL). Denatured alcohol is a clean, relatively safe fuel, but it does n't burn nearly as hot as canisters or other liquid fuels. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and burn( and carry) more fuel. Blended-fuel canisters( BF). These contain a blend of propane and butane, with isobutane or isopropane sometimes added to maintain a steadier heat output until the canister is fully emptied. Butane canisters( BU). Butane alone, without some propane, burns cooler and produces a smaller flame below 450F, limiting its usefulness in the backcountry. Isobutane( IB). Although it does n't burn as hot as blended fuels, isobutane burns steady to the last drop, tapering less than butane and blended fuels. Isopropane( IP). Isopropane is hotter and burns better at low temperatures than isobutane ; it shares the latter 's advantage of maintaining heat output until the canister empties. Kerosene( KE). It 's cheap, available around the globe, and burns hot. But kerosene produces dark smoke and fumes, blackens cookware, and clogs stoves quicker than a clean petrol like white gas. Whenever possible, choose " K-1 " over diesel kerosene. White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat per pound and is the dear choice for long trips in North Americathe only place it 's readily available, often under the Coleman label. White-gas stoves can flare up when fed too much gas while preheating( priming) the burner, so be careful, especially around flammable objects like a tent. Wood/solid fuel( WO). A woodburning stove relieves you of the weight of fuel, a plus on long trips where dry, small wood is readily available and can be legally gathered. But wood-burning stoves do n't burn as hot as liquid-fuel or canister stoves, and wet wood exacerbates that problem. BOILING TIME This number is provided by the manufacturer and represents the amount of time that elapses from the moment the flame hits the pot until 1 quart of roomtemperature water reaches a full boil at sea level. For multifuel stoves, we requested the boiling time when using white gas. For those stoves that burn a variety of canister fuels, we let the manufacturer choose which to burn. Factors besides fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, greatly affect performance. BURN TIME Also provided by the manufacturer, these two numbers represent the length of time it takes to consume the designated amount of fuel when running full throttle under optimum conditions. For instance, 90/7.8 means the stove will empty a 7.8ounce canister of fiel in 90 minutes. This measure gives an idea of how much fuel you 'll need on a given trip. FEATURES Double burner( DB). The Coleman Exponent( formerly Peak 1) Xpedition sports two burners that run off a single canister, while the VauDe/Markill Big Shot has two burners that run off of two canisters. Both models let you cook two pots of food simultaneously, with independent flame control. Fuel bottle included( FB). Some stoves come with a fuel bottle included in the purchase price. Hard-shell case( HC). Some stoves come in a protective plastic carrying case. Push-button ignition( PB). Also known as " piezo ignition, " this feature fights the stove with the push of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of a stove( and the weight, slightly) in exchange for enhanced convenience, but do n't leave the matches at home : We 've found piezo autolighters on many stoves to work erratically. Repair kit( RK). The stove comes with specialized tools and spare parts for routine field maintenance and repair. Stuff sack( SS). A nylon sack is included to protect the contents of your pack from the stove 's sharp edges. Windscreen( WS). Some are standalone, wrap-around aluminum windscreens that actually keep wind from affecting your stove 's heat transfer, while others are little more than bands of metal encircling the burner. WEIGHT Provided by the manufacturer, the weight for all stoves includes the burner unit only, unless it is permanently attached to the fuel tank. Fast And Lj &t; With its egg-carton texture and accordion fold, the Cascade Designs Therm-a-Rest Z-Rest( $32) looks a bit unorthodox, but the molded foam pad offers a terrific combination of low weight, fast deployment, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " April 1995). Several of our editors swear by the threequarter-length version as a backup winter pad. Built To Last Despite years of hard traveling, we 've failed to put a dent in Crazy Creek 's PowerLounger( $51), which sports a nylon cover protecting virtually indestructible sheets of closed-cell foam. This 54-inch mat also features stays and straps for quick conversion to a comfy chair. Winter Warrior One editor has spent a dozen winter nights -- including two above the Arctic Circle -- sleeping soundly atop Slumberjack 's AirLite Composite self-inflating pad( $89). Almost 2 inches thick, it features a layer of closed-cell foam beneath an open-cell layer ; the combination provides insulation that 'll make you forget the snow below. A slipresistant surface limits slip-sliding during the night.( Watch for an upcoming review.) Comfort King With more than 2 inches of air-inflated foam cushion, not even a temperamental princess will feel a pea under a Cascade Designs Therm-a-Rest Camp Rest pad( $82). Our bigguy testers also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet and elbows off the cold ground, though all this comfort weighs more than 4 pounds. Best Lounge Act Mountain Hardwear 's Back Country 60 Camp Chair( $80) is a veritable backwoods La-Z-Boy that 's also a 60-inch sleeping pad. The chair provides the utmost in comfort when kicking back around camp and features a high back so you can recline with your head and neck fully supported. There are removable aluminum stays for dependable support and easy packing.( Watch for an upcoming review.) No-Slip Sleeper For dream-time gymnasts-those folks who toss and turn all night long-the grippy-as-arock-shoe cover on Appalachian Mountain Supply/Artiach 's Skin-Mat( $72 for the regular long) will keep your bag from sliding around during noc nal contortions. Testers also raved about the SkinMat 's tiny dime sions when rolled tight( " Sleeping Beauties, " October 1996). TYPE Closed-cell foam( CF). This is the pad material for hikers who chronically abuse gear. Millions of tiny air bubbles locked in the foam prevent intrusion by water, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly impervious to tent stakes, stove sparks, and careless dragging around camp. Crampons and canine teeth, however, are another matter. The downside is that closed-cell foam ca n't be compressed since the air ca n't be sqeezed out, so these pads get quite bulky. The most common compromise is to go with a thin mat, providing good insulation but little cushioning. Open-cell foam( OF). Thick and cushy like a big sponge slab, open-cell foam conforms to your curves for a great night 's rest. These pads tend to be inexpensive, but they soak up water( unless encased in a waterproof cover) and can be bulky when rolled up. Closed-cell foam/opwn-cell foam hybrid( CF/OF). By bonding a layer of closed-cell foam to a swath of open-cell foam, companies create a durable insulation base with a cushy top panel for comfort. A water- and tear-resistant cover generally encases the pad. Self-inflating pad( SI). Put a slab of open-cell foam iside an airtight cover, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. When packing for travel, open the air valve and roll up the pad, compressing the foam and squeezing the air out through the valve ; close the valve so it does n't reinflate. When you get into camp, open the valve and let the pad unroll and suck in air. Customize the firmness of the pad with a few puffs of air, twist the valve shut, and you have a comfy, cozy, waterresistant bed. Punctures are problematic, though most can be repaired( see March 1999, p. 168, for repair instructions). Other materials( OM). One pad maker, Stephenson 's Warmlite, has forsaken foam and opted instead to fill mattresses with down. FEATURES Chair conversion( CC). Webbing straps and buckles bend these pads into comfy camp chairs. Conversion kits and sleeves are also available to retrofit many nonconverting pads. Integral compression or roll straps( CS). These built-in straps keep the pad tightly rolled and compressed, and can be used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( MC). Get firm support under your spine, soft support under your pelvis, and medium support for your neck and head. Multiple chambers allow you to adjust the cushioning in different parts of the pad for a customized feel. In addition, a puncture flattens only part of the pad rather than the whole thing. Drawbacks include higher prices and greater weight, thanks to additional material in the chamber walls. Molded surfaces( MS). Many closedcell foam pads have molded ridges or bums. The ridges trap air between the Dad and the ground and between you and the pad, creating more cushion and insulation with the same amount of foam. The textured foam also makes the pad less slippery. Mummy shaped( MU). Tapered like a mummy sleeping bag, these pads use less material so they weigh less. Anyone who turns and tosses during the night might find the pads too narrow. No-slip surface( NS). Textured or rubberized materials help keep slick sleeping bags from sliding off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pads feature a thicker chamber at the head ; some pads sport a pocket for stashing a jacket or spare set of clothes for use as a pillow. Repair kit( RK). Many pads come with a repair kit including glue and patches. If your pad did n't come with one, buy a repair kit before heading out. Stuff sack( SS). Many pads come with stuff sacks to protect them from damage when lashed outside a pack. Sidebar <p>
