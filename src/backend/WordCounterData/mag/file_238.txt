2028741 Soaring above all comers, second-year sensation DWYANE WADE has taken over as Miami 's best player // It is becoming the dirty little secret that no one in the Miami Heat organization seems willing to acknowledge. Not as long as Shaquille O'Neal maintains an ego as enormous as his stature. Not as long as Dwyane Wade remains remarkably humble for a player who has captivated the basketball universe in leading the Heat into the Eastern Conference finals. But the reality rests in the numbers and in the results. The best player on the Heat wears No. 3, not No. 32. He is at his best playing above the rim, not rattling the rim. He gets to the foul line and basks instead of bricks. " If you do n't see it now, you 'll see it very soon, " Pacers scout Jimmy Powell says. " I do n't think Shaq will ever say he 's Dwyane 's " supporting player. " But Dwyane 's 23, and Shaq 's 33. Shaq 's got only two or three more good years in this league. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 's going to have to take a back seat just to save his body. " Case in point : Bothered by a deep thigh bruise, O'Neal sat out the last two games of the Heat 's second-round sweep of the Wizards, giving him a front-row seat as Wade scored 31 and 42 points. The extra rest gave Shaq 12 days to try to get healthy before the Heat started its series against the Pistons. By the time the Wizards series was over, some of the Washington players were wondering whether they would have been better off with O'Neal on the court, forcing Heat coach Stan Van Gundy back into the equal-opportunity offense in which Wade averaged 24.1 points and O'Neal 22.9 during the regular season. " He 's putting them on his back, and he 's giving them the confidence that every time they go on the court they can win, " Wizards forward Antawn Jamison says of the Heat 's second-year guard. " He 's phenomenal. " " With his will and his determination, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another level, " Wizards coach Eddie Jordan says. Even the Big Spectator is impressed. " The last 10 years, draft picks have been coming in 40 percent talent and 60 percent marketing, " Shaq says. " The only advantages those guys have over him are the Nike contracts and the commercials. Dwyane is a player, and nobody knew about him. 1 knew he was a player, but I did n't know he would go to the next level so fast. " If he had a runaway ego, Wade would be the closest thing in the NBA to Kobe Bryant. But that also would make him an undesirable to O'Neal. Wade knows that ; the Heat appreciates that. So Wade leans toward a selflessness that makes him the perfect O'Neal teammate. " I do n't care if people think I 'm the best player or if they do n't, " Wade says. " As long as my team is the best, I 'm not going to worry about it. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wade so far has excelled. To share the spotlight with O'Neal without either casting a shadow or getting caught in one is a daunting challenge. Fail to heed the wisdom of O'Neal, and mockery ensues. Fail to provide ample support, and the inside-outside magic disappears. " When we played Shaq and Kobe in the( 2000) Finals, they had great chemistry, and I think that was a big part of why they were so successful, " Powell says. " 1 think as they grew further and further apart, the chemistry certainly was a lot worse. " Photograph // In O'Neal and Wade, Powell sees bliss. " It 's the start of a new relationship, and, obviously, the start of it has gone really well for them, " he says. " Dwyane Wade, any big man would love to play with him. He gives everything he has and is talented. And I think the combination of those two, whether they can be as good as Shaq and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's possible. " Van Gundy says the relationship works because each cashes in on the other 's assets. " The confidence level is the biggest thing Dwyane gains from Shaq, " Van Gundy says. " With a great player like Shaq next to you, you have great confidence you 're going to win. It takes a little bit of the pressure off of you. You just see another great player and his confidence and how he carries himself and the poise and everything else. I think that rubs off a little bit. " As for O'Neal 's net gain from Wade, Van Gundy says it 's more of an intangible. " What he 's done, in my estimation, is he 's sort of helped Shaq 's enthusiasm come back-to play with another great player, who Shaq looks at differently, as somebody who 's very unselfish, " Van Gundy says, careful to avoid invoking Bryant 's name. " I think there 's a great appreciation for each other there and a real high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's two great players working together to make it work on the team, and I think that 's what has made our chemistry as good as it is. " Wade looks up to O'Neal, in both tangible and figurative ways. " He 's impacted me more by being a big brother type, " Wade says. " Anytime I need any advice, on whether it comes to marketing, whether it comes to life, he 's always there to give me advice because he 's been through everything. " Dwyane 's game The expectation this season was that O'Neal would overwhelm double- and triple-teams in the post, creating the type of space on the perimeter for Wade that Lamar Odom and Caron Butler could not last season. Instead, Wade often has been beating the double- and tripleteams, leaving O'Neal alone under the hoop to feast on alley-oops and unchallenged putbacks. " Dwyane Wade is to the point where you have to game-plan against him, " Jordan says. In some ways, Wade is almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down defenses. The difference is Iverson is 165 pounds of slipperiness ; Wade is 212 pounds of muscle. Still, " When you put two guys on him, " Jordan says, " he just splits them. " If there is a book on Wade, it is to force him right. " If you look at all the graphs, his percentage is so much higher on the left quadrant of the floor, " Jordan says. So the Wizards tried to push Wade right. In Game 3, the strategy worked for a half, with Wade shooting 5-for-12 and committing six turnovers. Wade disarmed the strategy in the second half, shooting 9-for-15 with only two turnovers. " Once he started taking what they were giving him, he took the ball right and dunked. He took the ball right in transition and got a layup. Late in the game, he took the ball right and made a big layup. He went three times to his right and made jumpers, " Van Gundy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ca n't go to his right hand. " Photograph Wade 's low-key personality has enabled him to share the spotlight easily with Shaq. // With the 6-4 Wade playing point guard last season alongside 6-6 shooting guard Eddie Jones, it was particularly difficult to smother Wade with size. But with Wade back at shooting guard next to 6-3 point guard Damon Jones, putting a larger guard or a small forward on Wade might be the best way to stop him. The Pistons made that work particularly well in the teams ' final regular-season meeting, blanketing Wade with 6-9 small forward Tayshaun Prince and his long arms. Wade shot l-for-6 and fouled out in an 80-72 loss. Like... Heat President Pat Riley says a comparison is brewing. " I think instead of calling someone Jordanesque, it 's going to be called Wadenesque, " Riley says. " The difference is Dwyane 's not as angular. Michael was 6-6 and long. Dywane 's in more of a compact package. " Jordan comparisons, of course, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it the Heat that drafted Harold " Baby Jordan " Miner?) But before dismissing this one as preposterous, consider it in these terms : where Jordan was in his second year and where Wade stands today. Jordan did n't have the likes of Shaq on his side, but he also did n't take his team to the conference finals until his fifth season. Jordan 's influences on Wade are undeniable. Growing up on the South Side in Chicago, Wade was 9 when Jordan won his first championship, 16 when Jordan celebrated his sixth. " When you 're young, you 're like a sponge, " Wade says. " You 're taking everything in. That was one of the best teams the game has ever seen. I 've just picked that up and tried to carry it over. Without even thinking about it, I think it 's a part of me now. " Kevin Loughery, who coached Jordan during his first NBA season, says the comparison has merit. " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw in Wade, " Loughery says. " Going one-on-one, he could get to the hoop with anybody. And finish. And hang in the air. That 's what makes these guys. Defensively, they 're both very good. Michael turned into a great defensive player. I think that Wade can do the same thing. He blocks shots. His anticipation is fantastic. I really think he might be the most underrated player in the league. " Steve Kerr, who shared in Jordan 's last three championships in Chicago, also does not shy from the comparison. " Dwyane 's athleticism is stunning, " says Kerr, who has served as a television analyst on several Heat playoff broadcasts. " Maybe not as startling as watching Michael, but it 's close. He puts such pressure on defenses, and what I remember most about Michael is no matter who was defending him, he always put so much pressure on the defense. That 's what Dwyane does. He still gets wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think, has a little more of a point guard mentality than Michael. Michael was a scorer first, and then he 'd create for other people. " Van Gundy, however, is willing to go only so far. " I mean your career can fall well short of Michael Jordan 's and it can still be a Hall of Fame career, " he says. But... " I certainly see where the comparisons come from, and I do think mentalitywise, there 's a lot of similarities. There 's a confidence ; there 's a real great mental toughness, great intelligence.
