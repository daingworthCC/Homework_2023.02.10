2022541 <p> The Inns of Court are headquarters to an antique legal system whose practitioners are now embroiled in Britain 's ' Bar Wars ' <p> " And did not your own mother say that when she heard of what you had done to your brother she thought she would faint dead away? " <p> " I did nothing illegal, " said the sullen defendant. <p> It was my first visit to the Victorian-Gothic caverns of London 's Law Courts, and up to this point it might have been a scene being acted out in any courtroom in the world. The judge and the lawyers wore white wigs turned gray in service and somber black gowns, but the case they were conducting was a case like any other, a sordid squabble over a bit of financial skulduggery in Yorkshire. <p> With the next question by counsel for the plaintiff, it became uniquely English. <p> " And did not your closest business associate say that when he was informed of what you had done to your brother, he felt, to use his own expression, gobsmacked. " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. But his counsel, paying no attention to him, was already on his feet. " I believe, " he said, " that my learned friend will find that the term used on this occasion was more likely to have been ' gobstruck. " ' <p> The judge, who had been impassively taking notes, leaned forward now, his face crinkling with curiosity. " ' Gobstruck, ' " he said, testing each syllable on his tongue, " what a curious expression. Would it be American? " <p> " I submit with great respect to your Lordship, " said and beleaguered, don carry on counsel for the defendant, " that its origin is more likely to be found in the north of England. " <p> " I suggest to my learned friend, " suggested counsel for the plaintiff, " that it may rather derive from Ireland. " <p> And for the next few minutes the bitter brothers from Yorkshire were quite forgotten, and we might imagine ourselves transported from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an ancient college where three learned gentlemen in black gowns were chattering wittily about etymology. <p> Then it stopped as abruptly as it had started, and we were back racing through the testimony of the defendant. <p> " Racing " is a word that comes automatically to mind, at least to the mind of any foreigner who attends an English trial. The law 's delays have been proverbial in England since at least Prince Hamlet 's day, but they can often be laid at the door of the solicitors, the lawyers who prepare the case in Britain 's higher courts. Once it comes to the courtroom, the trial is the domain of barristers, and they usually proceed with verve and skill and dispatch. The reason is simple : almost everything in an English civil trial is oral. Perhaps this reflects a national trait- " We English, " as one bland barrister puts it, " would rather listen and talk than read and think. " At all events, there is little sign of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trials. Far more is done by word of mouth-opening statements, examination of witnesses, closing statements. In most cases, the moment the lawyers have stopped talking the judge starts to utter, not read, his decision. If the losing side is dissatisfied, it can take the case to a court of appeal, which is perfectly capable of listening to oral arguments and settling the matter with an oral decision. <p> Clearly it must take special training as well as special talents to make a system like this work satisfactorily ; it can hardly be improvised. There is a rumor that one brilliant trial judge in New York began to imitate the English style of giving immediate judgment, but he was warned off it by the appellate court for fear that other judges would try it too and make utter fools of themselves. <p> Though it has been under violent attack at home in recent years, the British legal system has always enjoyed enormous prestige abroad. It relies on rules of conduct that have been refined slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have every detail of the case at their fingertips. They have to be able to think quickly on their feet. They have to be masters of wordplay. The judge has to be able to keep a running rational summary in his mind of all the complexities of fact and law filling the air in front of his bench. Lawyers and judges alike have to understand the nuances of the language they speak so that they can dispose of matters like the credibility of evidence with a few words, sometimes an unspoken nod. They can do it so smoothly because they are all, In effect, members of one great cozy club. In the higher court system of England and Wales, where all serious crimes are judged, and all civil suits involving more than o5,000( soon to be o25,000), all trial lawyers and judges are required to be barristers, that is, they must have been " called to the Bar. " There is, and for the past 400 years has been, only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to join an Inn of Court. There are four of these Inns, 11 in Central London : Inner Temple, Middle Temple, Lincoln 's Inn and Gray 's Inn, each jealous of its sepaate traditions but all with a common view of the duties and prerogatives of the Bar. <p> In the old days the Inns provided all the legal instruction necessary, not in formal classes but by continual contact between students and their learned elders, mostly in the great communal dining rooms, listening and talking about cases and precedents while the claret and the port went round. A student who was judged to have soaked up enough learning after a few years was summoned to step up to the Bar, which was originally a wooden barrier marking off the part of the hall reserved for the exclusive use of " the benchers, " or senior members of the Inn. From that moment on, the candidate was authorized to practice before the higher courts of England and Wales. <p> Modern bureaucratic times have changed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take regular courses in torts and evidence and pass official examinations. But you still can not become a barrister without having taken at least 24 meals over a two-year period at your Inn. In practice, everyone takes more meals than that, both because they are cheap and because they provide a way of slipping painlessly into the community of the Bar. Aspiring barristers once formed a tightly knit group of young men from upper-class families who had gone to Oxford or Cambridge. Today, a liberal scholarship policy insures that they will come from all up and down the social scale and from all kinds of Redbrick universities. And almost a third of them are women. No matter. By the time they have been through an Inn of Court they all speak with the same snuffling, snorting Oxonian drone, they have all adapted themselves to the tone of the English courtroom, which an American judge, Benjamin Kaplan, has defined as " informality within a formal setting. " <p> Physically speaking, the Inns are four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice land north of the Thames on both sides of Fleet Street where it meets the Strand. Lawyers are said to have begun congregating there in the 14th century, renting some quarters for o1O a year in buildings that had belonged to the Order of the Knights Templars before it was dissolved by King Edward 11. It was a shrewd choice, for it lay halfway between the center of financial power in the City and the center of political power in Westminster. Medieval London was subject to periodic assaults by rebels such as Jack Cade, who led a mob into town in 1450 shouting nasty things like " Death to all lawyers! " The canny lawyers laid low, though at times this meant more than just rising above the epithets. In one incident, they had to watch as the deeds and records of the Temple buildings went up in smoke. They went on squatting there, and by the next century, in the time of the Tudors, they had come to be recognized as legal owners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized themselves as corporate entities, self-governing and self -supporting and eventually very rich. Gradually, too, they gathered unto themselves the monopoly of preparing young hopefuls for the Bar. All the great judges and advocates and legal philosophers who have created the extraordinary fabric of the English law passed through the Inns. So did many others whose names shine brightly in the political and cultural life of the nation. Sir Thomas More and Sir Francis Drake and Sir Walter Raleigh and Shakespeare 's Sir John Falstaff, Sir Francis Bacon and John Donne, Sir William Blackstone and William Penn and William Pitt, Boswell and Fielding and Sheridan and De Quincey and Lamb and Thackeray and Macaulay, King Edward VII, Margaret Thatcher and, of course, Rumpole of the Bailey all took their meals at an Inn of Court. So did five signers of the American Declaration of Independence ; Mohandas K. Gandhi( disbarred in 1922 after being convicted of sedition in India but formally reinstated in the rolls of the Inner Temple in 1988) ; as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Walled off from the roaring traffic of the Embankment and Fleet Street and High Holborn, each Inn is self-centered community with its own gardens, lush with cherry and magnolia, camelia and crocus ; its own library ; its own dining hall ; its labyrinth of walks and lawns ; its blocks of offices and flats let out mostly to barristers. Tourists still line up to see the rooms where Dr. Johnson lived and pontificated two centuries ago. <p> The English have always believed, with some reason, hat their institutions are quite unlike those of other nations. They were not created, like those of the Russians, by the ukase of autocrats, or like those of the French, by unbridled human reason. They have grown slowly, haphazardly, absentmindedly but shrewdly. The rolling English drunkard, boasted Chesterton, made the rolling English road. just so with the Inns of Court, which are the product of uncoordinated but surprisingly harmonious growth over the centuries. Certainly no sober man, starting from scratch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system, which entrusts decisions in all criminal cases in the higher courts to 12 citizens chosen specifically because they know nothing about the matter in hand. Yet the world recognizes it as one of the glories of England, and of the United States and other countries that have borrowed it from England. <p> Sometimes the roll becomes a lurch, and the system has to correct itself. The Lord Chancellor 's Court( Chancery) was created to provide a quicker, fairer way through the tangle of precedents and technicalities that were delaying justice in other courts. By the 19th century it had itself become so encrusted with its own technicalities, so afflicted with monstrous delays, that Dickens could write in Bleak House that it " exhausts finances, patience, courage, hope, overthrows the brain and breaks the heart. " Toward the end of the century it was abolished as an independent entity and absorbed into the regular court system, where it functions at the same speed as any other. Crusader effigies ; clicking computers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effigies of Crusaders lying stiffly on their tombs, and next door computers are clicking away in the more up-to-date offices. The hammer-beams of the roof in the dining hall of the Middle Temple looked down on the first performance of Shakespeare 's Twelfth Night in February 1602. When the producers wanted an authentic 18th-century background for the movie version of Henry Fielding 's Tom Jones, they simply cleared the cars out of King 's Bench Walk in the Inner Temple so Squire Western and his friends driving up in their carriages could feel completely at home. <p> The horsehair wigs that barristers wear date back only to the 1840s, when they replaced the old model made of human hair, which had to be periodically recurled. It is now a rite of passage for the fledgling barrister to have his or her skull measured at Ede &; Ravenscroft on Chancery Lane for the wig that will stay in place for a lifetime of courtroom oratory.( Lawyers on this side of the Atlantic might still be wearing them had not Thomas Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they made English lawyers look like " rats peeping through bunches of oakum. ") <p> On the other hand, the tradition that the benchers of Lincoln 's Inn may drink the sovereign 's health without rising to their feet goes all the way back to 1660 when they were joyously welcoming King Charles 11 home from his travels, with such joy and on such unsteady legs that the gracious monarch told them, " Gentlemen, you may sit. " <p> " Gentlemen, " he called them, for barristers have always been just that. In the rigid class structure of old England, being called to the Bar was one of the few ways an ambitious young man from the lower orders could rise quickly and safely up the social ladder. In 1880 a father wrote to his son who was pondering a choice of careers that, while he would not oppose his turning to mercantile pursuits if he insisted, " it would be a great comfort to me, and to those who love you, that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The young man went on to become Sir Edward Marshall Hall, the most successful and flamboyant of trial lawyers in the early 20th century. <p> One of the peculiarities of the English higher court system is its division of lawyers into the two classes of barristers and solicitors, with the former arguing the cases and the latter doing nearly everything else. There has never been any doubt, though, as to which outranks the other. The time has passed when solicitors had to use the tradesmen 's entrance while barristers could walk in the front door. Young barristers are no longer given a manual of conduct warning them against the consequences of too much social intercourse with solicitors ' clerks. But a touch of the old distinctions lingers on. A barrister almost never sets foot in a solicitor 's office ; it is usually the solicitor who brings his client around to the barrister 's chambers. The solicitor negotiates and collects a fee like any other businessman, while the barrister would be made acutely uncomfortable by the mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gown a symbolic fold forming a little pouch in which grateful clients once slipped pieces of gold as honoraria that would not sully his hands. He does of course get paid, but all that side of things is handled by his clerk. <p> In the higher courts, the solicitor does the background and the paperwork. He prepares the case, tracks down and examines witnesses, collects and weighs the facts, and " briefs, " or hires, a barrister who he believes can handle the case properly. Today there are about 6,500 barristers in England, compared with 45,000 solicitors. Barristers live in a different world ; they are members of a small caste whose closest approximations are the samurai of old Japan. Like the samurai, a barrister has been exhaustively trained for one thing and one thing only, to fight for hire. His main function is to appear in court for his client. He is handed the necessary facts by the solicitor. He does not see witnesses till they take the stand. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his client till the day the trial starts. <p> Solicitors generally form partnerships. The barrister is a lone gun, an independent operator. He does team up with others to form what are called chambers, usually but not invariably with offices in an Inn of Court. The members split expenses and the services of a clerk, but they can conceivably find themselves on opposite sides of the same case. For barristers, by long custom, operate on what is called the cab-rank rule, which means they must take whatever case is offered them. Of course, as one barrister told me, " There are cab ranks and cab ranks. There are the Volkswagen kinds and there is my kind, which is more on the order of Rolls Royce. " But the rule remains that if the solicitor comes with a brief that is within his area of expertise, and if his time is not already booked, and if the fee that his clerk demands can be met, then the barrister must take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself on either side of a larcenous mess in Yorkshire. He may find himself prosecuting a bank robber for the Crown, or defending an IRA terrorist against the Crown. All he has to do is to fight as well as he can. <p> It is only natural for people brought up in this tradition to feel a certain pride when they step forward in lonely battle clad in the majesty of the law, and there is more than genteel self-mockery involved when they cite the lines they all know by heart, sung by the Lord Chancellor in the Iolanthe of W S. Gilbert( of Inner Temple) : " The Law is the true embodiment / Of everything that 's excellent. / It has no kind of fault or flaw, / And 1, my Lords, embody the Law. " <p> These sentiments are not shared by everybody. For most of this century, the English legal system has been increasingly under attack at home for being antiquated, inefficient, unjust. The Bar especially has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periodically introduces reforms, broadens its membership, tries to make its services more easily available. But the critics always say the reforms are too timid. Government after government has set up commissions to examine the structure of the legal system. They have introduced many modifications and innovations, but they have all left untouched the two main pillars of the system-the division between barristers and solicitors, and the independent status of each barrister on his cab rank. <p> In recent years, however, the system has shown signs of strains and cracking from within. In fact, in England these days people speak of the " Bar Wars. " <p> It began with a great error in judgment made in the last century. The solicitors, organized in the Law Society, managed to secure for themselves a monopoly on what is called conveyancing, that is, all the paperwork, title search, etcetera, connected with the buying and selling of a piece of real estate. This is a comparatively easy and highly profitable form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they might have been in exploring other areas. <p> The result was that by the late 20th century they discovered that much of the business-related work that makes fortunes for American lawyers-taxes, for instance-had slipped out of their hands into those of the giant accounting firms. This was bad enough. But then people began wondering in public just what justification there was for the conveyancing monopoly at all. Surely accounting firms, real estate agents and banks could do the work just as well, and perhaps more efficiently and more cheaply. <p> If they lost their monopoly, the solicitors of England might lose a third to a half of their income. Where were they to turn? One obvious place was the barrister 's traditional turf. Why, after all, should only people who had taken meals at the Inns of Court have the right to appear in the upper courts? They claimed to have a special expertise in forensic tactics and courtroom skills. But the fact is that more than 90 percent of civil actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presided over by magistrates or justices of the peace( who are mostly unpaid and untrained in the law, and form another of the curious glories of the English system). And in the lower courts solicitors can and do appear alongside barristers, examining witnesses like them, arguing like them, citing the same precedents. Why preserve an artificial barrier that had no real justification but its old age? Why not take the logical step of fusion, merging solicitors and barristers in one united order of attorneys? <p> Labor governments might have been expected to push for fusion in accordance with their leveling principles, but Labor governments came and went with no basic change. The attack when it came was from a totally unexpected quarter, the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher. Mrs. Thatcher believed in free and open competition and hated restrictive practices of all kinds. In her eyes the Bar and the Law Society were not so much upholders of immemorial tradition as they were trade unions enforcing a closed shop that artificially hiked up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, presented a Green Paper, a proposal for legislation " for securing a better and more cost-effective service to the public from lawyers and the courts. " Contingency fees, a historic first <p> Lord Mackay is a Scot, brought up in a land with a different legal system from that of England and Wales. Unhampered by tradition, he called for more radical changes than any of the lawyers of England had seen in 700 years. The Green Paper proposed that the solicitors ' monopoly on conveyancing be definitively wiped out. Solicitors would be allowed, having passed tests of their skill in advocacy, to appear in the higher courts, even to become judges there. So would others, including paralegals, if they had the necessary qualifications. Barristers would no longer be required to operate out of chambers. They need no longer be independent operators but might form partnerships with other barristers, or with solicitors, bankers, businessmen. <p> The job of setting professional standards and overseeing professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law Society or the Council of the Bar, but would be shared with an Advisory Committee with 15 members, 8 of them nonlawyers. Barristers would be allowed to seek out clients directly, and sue them if they did n't pay, without waiting for solicitors to handle things. And for the first time in English history, lawyers would be permitted to take cases on a contingency fee. <p> Lord Mackay knew these were all controversial, but he must have been gobstruck by the howl of outrage that went up, not just from barristers who saw their whole way of life threatened with meltdown, but from all over the social and political spectrum. The furor crystallized in a memorable debate in the House of Lords. Stripped of all real political power in this egalitarian century, the Lords still have their pomp and their prestige and know how to make themselves listened to. Many of them are distinguished judges and lawyers, and among them sit the nine or so Law Lords who form the Court of Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have always seen themselves as the last line of defense of English liberties, whether against the tyranny of kings or the tyranny of the majority expressed by the House of Commons. <p> On an April Friday, they rallied round the liberties of the Bar. They remained in session from 9 in the morning till almost 11 at night-no other crisis in English society, it was noted, had ever been able to delay the start of a weekend like this-noble lord and lady rising after noble lord and lady to bait and berate and blast the Lord Chancellor as he sat imperturbable on the woolsack. For every one or two who defended him, like Viscount Bledisloe, who refused to drop a tear over those " somnolent anachronisms, " the Inns of Court, there were a dozen to savage the Green Paper. <p> " A mass of claptrap, " said Lord Hutchinson of Lullington. Swatting " a fly on our foreheads with a pickax, " said the Earl of Onslow, warming to his subject ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoe my horse. " Why should standards be lower for lawyers than for blacksmiths? Detail by detail they tore it apart and attacked its basic concept of making the legal profession cost-effective. An institution that has developed slowly and subtly over 700 years, said Lord Hailsham, can not be treated like a corner grocery store. The independence of the law was at stake, they said. <p> The Lord Chancellor proposed to put the legal profession under the administrative control of the Advisory Committee ; many lords thought the committee should more appropriately be called a Quango. This unpleasant word, which stands for Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organization, was invented by the Tories to describe the entities set up after World War 11 by Labor governments to assist the state in its bureaucratic tasks. Any Quango that would rule the law would destroy the foundations of the country. " The Green Paper, " said Lord Beloff, " suggests using one pillar of the British Constitution, namely parliamentary sovereignty, to overthrow the other pillar... the rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system. " <p> This argument struck a deeply responsive chord in the English psyche. The average Englishman 's direct experience with the law is apt to be sordid and unpleasant, involving things like traffic accidents and petty larcenies. His opinion of lawyers is not necessarily high( the Earl of Onslow pointed out that of the nine references to lawyers in the Oxford Book of Quotations, not one is complimentary), but at the back of his mind he is aware that law and lawyers are necessary to his freedom. They are there today as they were on a Sunday in 1670 when William Penn and William Mead were arrested for " causing an unlawful and tumultuous assembly " by preaching in the middle of Gracechurch Street. When the jury hearing the case found them not guilty, the judge ordered it to change the verdict, and when the jurors refused he had them locked up " all night without meat, drink, fire or other accommodation ; they had not so much as a chamber-pot, though desired. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and locked up again till one of them took a plea of habeas corpus to the Court of the King 's Bench, and there Mr. justice Vaughan established for all time that a defendant acquitted by an English court must be set free. <p> Arbitrary power is not necessarily a thing of the past. England has no written constitution, and no Supreme Court in the American sense. There is nothing to prevent a majority of the House of Commons from voting any law it wants and then creating an apparatus of commissions and boards to administer it. The modern state is crammed with such bodies continually issuing orders to private citizens. Generally the private citizen can do little about it, except that by longstanding tradition judges have a right to intervene. The High Court judges of England are appointed by the government, but they are all brought up in the fiercely independent tradition of the Bar. Once appointed they can be removed only by a vote of both houses of Parliament, and the only one ever so removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Admiralty in Ireland, dismissed in 1830 for appropriating o922 to his own use. <p> In 1946, demobilized soldiers applying for disability pensions were told by the Ministry of Pensions that they had to prove that their disabilities had been caused by their service in the armed forces. Some of the soldiers went to law, and Mr. justice Denning told the Ministry that the burden of proof was on it to show that the disabilities were not service-related. When the Ministry said that the time limit for filing applications had run out, Denning told it to extend the time limit. The Ministry obeyed. <p> In the long run, such memories were too strong even for Mrs. Thatcher 's government, and it backed down. The final bill to reform the legal system passed through the House of Commons just before she fell from power last year. But it was only a pale reflection of the original Green Paper. Some of its more sensible features are still left-the conveyancing monopoly, for example, is finished. The Advisory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts. A very limited form of contingency fee will be permitted as well. Barristers will not be forced into partnerships, they will remain lone warriors as in the past. The Advisory Committee will codify professional standards, subject to veto by senior judges. Especially now, because of a few recently celebrated cases in which justice was flagrantly miscarried, there is public agitation for quick reforms. But the judges can probably be counted on to make sure that whatever changes come will be gradual, practical, English. The road of the law will go on rolling into the future the way it has for 700 years. <p> By Robert Wernick <p>
