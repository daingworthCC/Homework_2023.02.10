2006241 Siting is important for every garden, but especially so for those that seek to highlight a single color. Clearly defined, concentrated plant groupings draw visitors for closer inspection and allow the interplay between differing flower and foliage palettes and leaf and blossom textures their fullest effect. Here, artemisia( left foreground and rear center) and lamb 's ears( right, foreground, center, and rear) create islands of silvery gray that let the waves of grass recede into the background while they raise the fleecy white rose petals( back, left and right) to seeming cloud status. // Provided that one does not run the idea to death, and provided one has enough room, it is interesting to make a one-colour garden.... Rarely have so few words launched such a widespread trend in garden to design as did this declaration from Vita Sackville-West, the esteemed novelist, poet, and gardener who, with her husband, Sir Harold Nicolson, designed, planted, and wrote about the now-famed gardens at Sissinghurst, in Kent, England. Between 1930 and 1960 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deteriorated Tudor castle into a garden masterpiece that today attracts more than a million visitors a year. One of Sissinghurst 's centerpieces is the acclaimed White Garden. Much imitated, never repeated, it has spawned.a host of largely unsuccessful imitations across three continents. It is easy to understand the appeal of such a landscape : During the day, even in the hottest weather, a garden of white produces a cool, calming effect ; the real show, however, occurs at twilight, when the white blossoms luminesce in the near dark. Combine a bit of moonlight, a few fluttering moths and fireflies, and the heady fragrance of evening bloomers like moonflower and honeysuckle, and the experience can be sublime. Photograph Create an oasis of order, elegance, and calm. // Sounds alluring, does n't it? And simple, too? It is, after all, just white. The truth is, creating such a garden is deceptively complex because its success depends so heavily on pairing just the right mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The first and most essential consideration for a white garden is siting. While it has been suggested that one can simply create a " white section " of landscape within an existing border, a meager clump of white plants could never achieve the ethereal results defined by the Sissinghurst garden. An entirely white portion in an otherwise colorful landscape provides the same effect as a bag of white litter thrown on the lawn : unattractive and obtrusive. For a white garden to succeed, it needs to be set off from the rest of the landscape, as Sackville-West stated in describing her own garden : " I should like to use the old word garth for it, meaning a small piece of enclosed ground, usually beside a house or other building, for it is entirely closed, on one side by a high yew hedge and on the other sides by pink brick walls and a little Tudor house. " The white garden at Sissinghurst owes much of its effectiveness to such a frame : Entering this enclosed space, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can have time to appreciate the gardens extremely subtle palette. The second key to creating a successful white garden lies in the realization that a white garden is not predominantly white, but green. The various textures of the foliage act as a foil to the stark-white blossoms, muting their brilliance with a calm verdancy. Nature abounds in greens : the dusky green of yew, the emerald glow of box, and the glaucous chartreuse of lady's-mantle all work together to play up and pacify the attention-seeking white blossoms. Gray-leaved plants, such as lamb 's ears, santolina, and artemisia, also perform a beneficial role : Used in moderation, these " almost whites " act as a bridge between dark and light and serve to link the two serenely together. For those planning a white garden, there 's one other design quandary lurking among the delphiniums : After you 've determined the right setting for your garden, and have chosen a balanced selection of plants, the process of working with white flowers themselves can prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few varieties of white flowers in a vase ; immediately it becomes clear that, as with green, there are infinite shades of white in nature, and the brilliant whites of an Oriental lily can make the creamy white of an obedient plant or foxglove, for instance, look " dirty. " In the absence of color, foliage shape and texture also come into much more prominent play than you might otherwise expect : In an all-white garden, the eye is particularly drawn to the shape, color, and texture of the leaves, of which certain combinations work together extremely well, and others equally dash. You have to be willing to play with a white garden. A single-color garden, to quote Sackville-West again, " is great fun and endlessly amusing as an experiment, capable of perennial improvement, as you take away the things that do n't fit in, or that do n't satisfy you, and replace them by something you like better.... " If this sort of artistic tinkering does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer Saturdays, then you 'd best not attempt a white garden. Understanding all the challenges white gardens pose, you might fairly assume that gardeners devoted to ease and practicality would never attempt such a fussy thing in their own gardens. But if you do, you underestimate the allure of the all-white garden. Last year I, too, succumbed and began to convert an area off my terrace into an all-white garden. I chose the site for its sense of enclosure, and its proximity to the house allowed me to wander out at the end of a long day 's work or after dinner to enjoy the quiet calm of this orderly, fragrant swath of white. I ca n't say that the first year of this garden was an unqualified success, but I intend to continue planting, moving, and experimenting until I achieve a satisfying balance of color, texture, and form.

" Ah, " she said, " working on one of those white gardens? What could be easier? It 's just white.
