4075741 the explorers who surveyed the upper reaches of British Columbia 's Tchaikazan River must have had an awful time of it. The five of us had just spent a full day on horseback getting into the backcountry, and I was looking at a map spread out on the ground next to our tents. In the mountains surrounding us we had Miserable Glacier, Discord Glacier and Pathetic Glacier, all watched over by a raw knob of mountain called Desperation Peak. This seemed at odds with our cheerful campground. We had pitched our tent in a clearing among the pines next to an old trapper 's cabin. We had a fire pit with some benches made from felled logs and a clear, spring-fed creek flowing with sweet icy water just a few steps away. Even the journey to camp was pleasant. Our horses, a mixed lot wrangled from the feral herds that run in B.C. 's Cariboo-Chilcotin country, were surefooted, well-tempered and comfortable to ride. We had a week of hunting in pristine country to look forward to, and both my buddy Jason Nash and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our pockets. Seven days later, I was convinced the surveyors had sold this place short with their rosy descriptions. Mountain Rifles The hunt had started, as hunts generally do, with a blush of optimism and anticipation. Our stated purpose was to try out some new ammunition from Federal, specifically the Trophy Bonded Tip bullet, which is an updated version of Jack Carter 's classic Trophy Bonded Bear Claw. I had brought along a Model 700 built for me by Remington 's Custom Shop chambered in.280 Rem., a near-perfect cartridge for mountain hunting and was shooting the 160-grain Trophy Tip. Jason, who works in Federal 's press department, was using a.270 WSM, another excellent mountain cartridge, with 130-grain bullets. Mountain goats are notoriously tough animals, and while some of the yarns spun about their ability to absorb bullets have more to do with mediocre marksmanship than with the animals ' iron constitution, their reputation as a stout big-game animal is nonetheless deserved. Goats also have a penchant for launching themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This ensures a quick death as the animal cartwheels down the mountain, but often ruins the horns, cape and meat, and makes recovering the animal difficult or impossible. This is why nothing makes a guide happier than a client who manages to anchor a goat in place. To do that, it helps to come equipped with an appropriate combination of cartridge and bullet, one that allows for good accuracy, deep penetration and reliable terminal ballistics. Bearing all this in mind, the Trophy Tip bullet seemed a smart bet. At 160 grains, these 7mm projectiles have good sectional density, which helps penetration, and are constructed to open quickly but not over- expand in game. The plastic tip at the nose of the bullet and the boattail design assist with the bullet 's areodynamics, making them flatter shooting. Over the past year, I had used them in other calibers on whitetails, always with satisfying results, so I felt confident they would do the trick on these goats. They also happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an inch at 100 yards when I checked my zero in our base camp. The other three in our party were Mike Hawkridge, the owner of Tatlow Mountain Outfitters( tatlowmtn. com) ; Emery Phillips, his main guide ; and Mike 's father, Gerry, who had taken off some time from his regular job working in the mines to help with the horses and be the camp cook. Mike had been guiding this area for years and knew the country well. The first day we went upriver and stalked a lone billy that was bedded down on a ledge high above us. We rode a ways to get out of his sight and started up. The 3,000-foot climb did n't pan out, however. By the time we had gotten above where we thought he was bedded and worked our way over to his drainage, he had disappeared. Mike and I scrambled around the mountain to see if he was hiding in a crevice somewhere, but we never saw him again. As we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the river where we had tied up the horses, we passed a pine that had been stripped of its bark and carried the telltale grooves carved by a grizzly 's claws. The weather turned sour the next day. The temperature dropped and clouds rolled in. We took the horses into a drainage above camp. The animals huffed and sweated during the climb. I rode behind Emery 's long-legged paint, which he had purchased for $1,000 from the previous owner, who was sick of the horse bucking him off. Emery, an experienced cowboy, got along with the horse much better and claimed the horse had only tried to throw him once. Emery might have been a horse whisperer, but one thing he could n't cure was the prodigious amount of gas his horse produced during the ascent. I was worried the nag was going to blow my hat off and said words to that effect. Emery turned around in his saddle and offered up some cowboy wisdom. " A fartin ' horse never to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " he said. Whether there 's any merit to that, I could n't tell you, but I was certainly grateful for the fresh air when we left the horses at the tree line and started walking. Hide-and-Seek We spotted several goats around the enormous basin and decided to hike in the direction of two billies that were loitering in a saddle under the summit of Spectrum Peak, which towered over the drainage. The bigger of the pair seemed to be about the size of a small horse himself, and we wanted a better look at his head. It took us nearly three hours of hand-over-hand climbing up avalanche chutes and scree to get there. We did n't expect the two goats to stay put, and they did n't. After recovering our breath, we followed their tracks across fields of loose gravel, but then lost the trail when they wandered into a boulder-strewn area of harder ground. The weather worsened and we found ourselves in a fog of clouds playing a game of hide-and-seek with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We moved carefully along the spine of the mountain, peering into each clump of rocks and a depression where the goats might be bedded. After a half-hour of fruitless searching, Emery backtracked on a hunch. He took a look over a steep drop-off that went down the other side of the mountain, the north face of Spectrum Peak, and lying on a ledge 125 yards away and below us was a terrific billy. We did n't know if he was the one we had seen earlier, but there was no doubt he was a shooter. I crawled on my belly to the edge of the cliff and got into position. Lying flat, I could feel the cold mountain sucking the heat out of my body, and as soon as I took my glove off my shooting hand, my fingers started to go numb. The goat was facing directly away from me and lying slightly on its side. I put the crosshairs on his back and shot him between the shoulder blades. The only movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I put two more shots in the same spot as insurance to pin him in place. " Nice shooting, " Mike said. The Recovery The next morning, Emery and I made the long climb to the saddle that would take us over to the north face of the mountain to collect the goat. The weather could n't make up its mind. We had dark low clouds blowing down the valley, mixed with spots of blue sky and lots of wind. Mike and Jason took off in search of a billy for Jason. We followed a steep goat trail down into the bowl on the north face and hiked to the far side of the drainage so we could look back toward Spectrum Peak and spot my billy. Once we gained a little elevation, we saw him perched on the small ledge where I had anchored him the day before. Just below him was a nearly vertical wall of rock that dropped down to a steep slope of frozen gravel. Beneath that was an even larger cliff that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the sheer rock face that led to the top of the mountain where I had taken my shot. Anything wanting to get between those two spots would need wings. The goat had picked a hell of a spot to die in. Looking at the mountain through our binoculars, we decided to try to come at the billy from the side. We thought we might be able to climb the seam at the edge of the cliff where he was perched and then work our way over to him. We spent more than an hour getting to the seam, climbing up and across sloppy avalanche chutes in a bid to gain altitude. The slope at the seam was steeper than it had appeared from across the drainage, and Emery and I had to kick footholds into the semi-frozen mountain face with each step we took, while punching our leather-gloved hands into the dirt at eye level for extra purchase. Whenever we kicked a larger rock free, we would watch it bounce down the mountain, gaining speed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us. Neither of us could help counting the three or four beats of silence that passed before the sound of the rock smashing against whatever was below reached our ears. A misplaced foot here would surely be fatal. The seam was worse. The rock was wet and rotten and we pulled off fistfuls of the stuff every time we tried to get a handhold. Going up was n't an option, so Emery tried to work around the cliff, following a goat trail he claimed he saw but that was invisible to me. He returned about 20 minutes later. His goat trail had narrowed to a few inches in width and he was forced to turn around, as it twisted underneath an overhanging rock that he could n't fit beneath. " Those damn goats will crawl on their bellies to get across this stuff, eh? " he said. We figured the goat was less than 50 yards from where he had stopped. It was getting late, so we had to turn back. As we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take us back to camp, the wind had mounted into a gale and we had to lean into it to keep our footing. It was blowing a stinging snow straight up the mountain and into our eyes as we hiked back down to the horses. Jason and Mike fared better than we had. They found a billy that had the good manners to lead them on a chase that took them across a couple of scree fields to an avalanche chute right above camp, where Jason shot him with his.270 WSM. His goat practically rolled into camp. All the next day it rained, keeping us from another attempt at my goat. That night the skies let loose an even heavier downpour, and between the sound of the pounding rain and the wind cracking the tarp we had stretched above our tents, we did n't get much sleep. In the morning we saw that the pans around our fire had filled to overflowing. We could n't get a read on the weather. The wind was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but at the head of the valley loomed a wall of dark clouds. Regardless, our options were limited, and the four of us set back out to climb Spectrum Peak. This time, instead of corning at the goat from the side, we tried to get at it from straight below. We slowly climbed the bluffs, helped in our ascent here and there by small gravel-filled chutes that offered at least the illusion of sure footing. When we got to the cliff beneath the goat, we kicked at the gravel to make a flat spot to stash our packs. Leariing against the side of the mountain, we ate a lunch of hard salami, rye bread, trail mix and candy bars as it started to snow again. Looking up, we saw clouds tearing across the ridge, moving so fast that we got dizzy with the sensation of falling backward if we stared for more than a couple of seconds. These clouds were beginning to fill the bowl we were in, like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have much time. Mike and Emery shifted to a spot they thought was right beneath the goat and carefully placed their hands and feet on whatever solid rock they could find and climbed. I watched them vanish over the ledge above me. After getting hit by a couple of fistsized rocks they had kicked loose, I went back to our makeshift ledge to wait with Jason. An hour later they came back empty-handed. The conditions, which were bad to begin with, had gotten worse. The mountain became wetter, slicker and more rotten the higher they went. It was simply too dangerous to go on. I knew they had pushed it as far as they could, probably going farther than they should have. As soon as the adrenaline rush from their climb began to abate, both of them started to shiver uncontrollably. We were exhausted and dispirited. Back in camp, I figured that between the initial stalk and kill and the two full days of recovery efforts, I had racked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goat Not being able to tag him was a bitter pill to swallow. The next day Jason shot a handsome mule deer buck in velvet after a letter-perfect stalk. My own mule deer hunt on the final day was much less productive, thanks to an unfortunate encounter with a sow grizzly and her two grown cubs. But by that point I had come to accept that the breaks on this trip were n't going my way. The goat is still up there on his high and lonely perch. No scavenger will reach him, and it is doubtful even birds would bother his remains. Mike and Emery vowed to return this summer, when the weather is better, with some ropes and other climbing gear to make another attempt to find the goat of Spectrum Peak. So perhaps the final chapter of this hunt is yet to be written.
