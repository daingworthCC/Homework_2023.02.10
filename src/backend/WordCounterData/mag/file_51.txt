2006541 A once dingy kitchen is now bright, welcoming, and in complete harmony with its bayside setting // Sometimes, when you fall for a house it 's really the location that tugs at your heart-you might call it " love at first site. " Such was the case when Diana and Vincent Carvelli first saw their Mattituck, Long Island, home. Despite its spectacular white-sand-beach setting, the house was ordinary and the kitchen was no exception : dark wood cabinets, with just one small window overlooking beautiful Peconic Bay. " Right away I knew that view would have to become part of the kitchen, " says Diana. With the help of New York City architect David Bers, the Carvellis embarked on a whole-house renovation that included a complete kitchen makeover. Architect and client worked together on the open layout that suits the Carvellis ' casual lifestyle. " I wanted clean lines, " says Diana, " something reminiscent of beach houses of years ago. " The result is fresh and inviting-a place where grandchildren can roam and adults can lounge-efficient, and far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandkids-and that 's what inspired the color scheme, " says Diana. Sea-green glass tiles and Diana 's collection of jadeite establish a watery theme. APPLIANCES Because the Carvellis regularly entertain their five grown children and eight grandchildren, they need hardworking appliances, such as the Bosch cooktop and a pair of Bosch dishwashers- " It 's tough to get dishes for eight or more people into just one dishwasher, " notes architect David Bers. MATERIALS Each work area gets its own surfacing material : marble for the cooking zone ; stainless steel for the sink stand ; and oiled walnut for the center island. " I encourage people to cut right on the walnut, " says Bers. " You should allow surfaces to live and evolve. " He recommends cleaning the wood with bleach every two months, then wiping the surface with plain mineral oil. FLOOR The surface underfoot was painted with a gray floor enamel. The color suggests beach-weathered wood, and the finish stands up to sandy feet. LIGHTING A pair of pendant lamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the island, doing double duty as ambient and task lighting. COOKING Every Fourth of July, the Carvellis ' extended family gets together. They come from near and far to walk the beach, swim, and, of course, eat : burgers and dogs, traditional Italian fare, and plenty of fresh seafood. " They show up all day long, and they 're usually starving when they get here, " says Diana, laughing. She relies on her 36-inch oven under the cooktop( above left) to handle large trays of food when she 's planning to serve a crowd. GATHERING The kitchen is the prime gathering spot. " Everyone participates in the cooking, and we usually just end up staying in here, " says Diana. Personal effects such as the Statue of Liberty masks and the fish above the sink( shown on previous page) were collected over the years or pulled from The Yard Couple, the Carvellis ' antiques store in Sag Harbor, N.Y.

The children love to play in the sand and dip their feet in the water. She traded with a neighbor to get the trestle table on the porch( opposite) and the benches were originally in the home 's entry. Flags are a yearly tradition. " I hang them a different way each year, " she says. " There 's also one at the front of the house to greet everyone as they arrive. " Sidebar " What 's inspiring about country houses is their functionality, " observes Bers. He replaced the typical base cabinets throughout the kitchen with glass-fronted drawers reminiscent of 19th-century apothecary cabinets. The practical design makes it easy for guests to find dishes when helping out in the kitchen. Bead-board wainscoting on the backsplash reinforces the relaxed effect. SEE SHOPPING GUIDE FOR DETAILS.
