These services are not " free " ; the cost is rolled into the premiums. Anybody with insurance is simply prepaying for those services whether they receive them or not. The new law eliminates only the out-of-pocket expenses at the time of service. As my dad always said, " There is no free lunch. " # BARRY WAHNER Drexel Hill, Pa. # NORTH CAROLINA : TOO TAXING FOR SENIORS # I question your choice of Raleigh as one of the " Best Places to Retire " November. You gloss over North Carolina 's taxation of pensions, IRAs, and other investment earnings. Since most retirees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt. I really like Raleigh, but it is not the best place for seniors. # GENE WAGNER, Garner, N.C. #
