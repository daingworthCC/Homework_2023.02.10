2003741 Martin Cunningham baited his fishhook with another clump of smelly pink salmon eggs and cast it into southwest Washington 's Cowlitz River. As the boat drifted with the current last July, the 3-year-old First Class Scout felt his bait go bump-bump-bump along the rocky river bottom. Then came a sharp tug on the line. Martin quickly pulled up on his rod tip to set the hook in the steelhead 's mouth. As the silver rocket shot out of the river, Martin 's rod should have bent as line ripped off the spinning reel. But it did n't. The fish shook loose. Fishing 's for the Birds Martin reeled in the empty hook and frowned. " I 'm not fishing. I 'm just feeding the fish " As he took more salmon eggs from the bait box, he caught a glimpse of a great bird. An osprey leaped from its perch high atop a Douglas fir tree and swooped down to the river. The fish hawk swept its talons through the surface with deadly precision and came up with a steelhead so big that the bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now that 's fishing, " he said. Fishing Lessons But being bested by a bird did not bother Martin. " They 're experts, " he said. " I 'm still learning. " This was the first time Martin and other Scouts in his Renton, Wash., Troop 462 had fished for steelhead. A steelhead is a big rainbow trout. Rainbows are found in lakes and rivers across the United States, but only the ones that swim downstream and out to sea are called steelhead.( See " The Sea-Run Rainbow " box, next page.) These fish return upriver to spawn after a year or two at sea. Many return to the Cowlitz. Hundreds of thousands of hatchery-raised steelhead smolts are released in the river each year -- more than a million in 1993 alone. Got ta Getta Guide When the steelhead summer run began last year, Troop 462 was ready. The Scouts had long planned for the trip, thanks to Scoutmaster Joseph Madrano, an avid angler. With all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustrating. So he suggested a way for the Scouts to better their chances at catching steelhead : hire fishing guides. Guides live an angler 's dream. They fish all the time and get paid to do it. While the rest of the world goes to work, guides are on the water. They 're also working, of course -- but, hey, they 're still fishing.) Because of all their time on the water, guides know where to go and how best to catch fish. Take a Tip : Fish First, Fish Early That knowledge comes at a cost. The rate for a day of steelhead fishing is about $150 per person. Considering you can just plop down on a riverbank and toss out your hook for free, that sounds like a lot of money. " But when you have only one day to fish, " Mr. Madrano said, " a guide makes the difference between caching something or going home empty-handed. Plus the professional teaches you things you can use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scouts ' fishing luck had already changed. They found a guide service that made them a special deal, $150 per boat. The first pro tip came early -- as in 5:30 A.M. " Fish can feed all day and night, " explained Clancy Holt, a guide of 40 years. " But Saturday there 'll be other fisherman on the water. They 'll spook the steelhead, and the fish will stop biting. We need an early start so our bait is the first that the fish see. " A light fog floated on the river surface as the Scouts ' four boats headed for the first fishing spot at dawn. " Awesome, " said Tenderfoot Scout Erik Westover, 13, as the jet-drive outboard motors scooted the 20-foot-long flat-bottom boats down the shallow At a riverbend, the guides staggered the boats, letting the current drift them along the deep bend. After each run, the boats moved back to the beginning and drifted down again. ' Fish in the Boat ' Martin had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other information over marine radios. Not much later, the radios crackled with another report -- Martin had another fish on downstream. As his spinning reel let loose a scream, a steelhead shot up, seemingly dancing on the surface. It dived and Martin began to reel in line. The fish jumped, spun across the river -- and Martin reeled hard. Within 15 minutes, the tired fish came close enough to the boat to be netted. " Fish in the boat " guide Ken Marsyla reported over the radio. Silence followed congratulations as Scouts worked the river for their catches. Time passed peacefully amid the beauty of the lush Pacific Northwest. Blacktail deer, mink and raccoon came out of the forests to drink from the Cowlitz. Sparrows by the thousands dug nests high on the riverbank. A Solid Catch? Then Aaron Ritchey felt a tug on his line. The 12-year-old set his hook and reeled in his catch. The radios reported : " Aaron 's caught a rock fish. " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " looked like. The reply gave a detailed description of a stone. Loud laughter echoed down the river. Still, Aaron, who managed to hook three steelhead, had the last laugh. He finally boated a nine-pounder -- steelhead, that is. By day 's end, all the Scouts had had one good hit. A few, like Aaron, had hooked more than one steelhead and enjoyed the exciting battle for which the big fish is famous. From River to Dinner The troop returned to camp with five fine fish. Now came what many consider the best part of steelhead fishing -- the eating. " It 's hard to find a better-tasting fish than steelhead, " said Scoutmaster Madrano. It 's even harder to find the fish, because with very few exceptions, it is not sold in stores. If you want one, you have to catch it. As the cook re burned down and the troop chefs prepared for dinner, a couple of Scouts studied the catch. " Looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dinner, " Daniel Rezac observed, pointing to claw marks on three fish. Martin Cunningham remembered the osprey and its catch. " We 're not the only ones who love steelhead, " he said. <p>
