5014341 <p> As that Gen-X musical once asked, how do you measure a year? Some people measure it in days or months, others in paychecks and bills, and still others in daylights, in sunsets, in midnights, in cups of coffee. But have you considered measuring a year in celebrity feuds? You should really try it. You can pack a lot of living into our short time here that way. <p> Tomorrow -- Tuesday, July 2 -- is technically the halfway point from 2019 to 2020, but we 've had a year 's worth of feuds to unpack so far. That may sound like measuring a year by celebrity feuds actually makes our time here go faster, but when you really get into these kerfuffles, lay out the timelines, check the receipts, weigh your allegiances, assign blame, cheer your champion, you 've lived a thousand lifetimes in a mere hour. See? Getting into celebrity feuds is a way to expand our tiny allotment of time on Earth. <p> So let 's get into them. Taylor Swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brightest feuds here today. Just as we approached the midpoint of the year, she just so happened to air her displeasure with Scooter Braun, the Svengali who made Justin Bieber, and you can read more about that below.( Or maybe Braun is the reason we 're here? Depends on whose narrative you are subscribing to.) But do n't sleep on Anjelica Huston and the women of Poms, which also happened this year. Do n't sleep on beauty vlogger James Charles and other beauty vlogger Tati Westbrook. Please do n't sleep on that one. These are all great feuds that will make you feel incredibly old, but you 'll still be the same age you already are right now, so it 's a nice exercise in perspective. And that 's the best way to measure a year. -- Kenzie Bryant <p> What : After Braun acquired Swift 's old record label and her master recordings yesterday, she wrote on Tumblr, " now Scooter has stripped me of my life 's work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Essentially, my musical legacy is about to lie in the hands of someone who tried to dismantle it. " Braun has yet to respond himself, but pretty much everyone else has. Between the nuts-and-bolts questions -- did Scott Borchetta, the founder of Swift 's last label, really offer her a fair chance to acquire her masters, as he says? -- and the broader conversation about artistic ownership, the confrontation has been a ripe topic for anyone with an interest in pop music and an Instagram account from which to post about it. <p> Loser : The blogging platform Instagram <p> Winner : The Taylor Swift platform Tumblr <p> -- Dan Adler <p> Anjelica Huston 's Foot in the Mouth <p> Who : Anjelica Huston versus the cast of Poms, but mostly Jacki Weaver <p> When : May 1, 2019 to May 17, 2019, the John Wick : Chapter 3 - Parabellum release <p> What : During a rollicking Q&amp;A, Huston told Vulture 's Andrew Goldman, " Quite honestly, I 'm looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't apologetically humble or humiliating like, ' Band of cheerleaders gets back together for one last hurrah, ' you know. An old-lady cheerleader movie. I do n't like that kind of thing. " Turns out the plot she described was an actual script that got turned into an actual movie that happened to premiere the same day New York published Huston 's interview online. The movie -- Poms -- starred big names like Diane Keaton, Celia Weston, and Jacki Weaver, the latter of whom told Vanity Fair, " I just laughed. And then I said, ' Well, she can go fuck herself. ' " <p> What : Jameela Jamil -- star of The Good Place -- first shared her feelings about the Kardashians in September 2018, when a podcast interview she gave to Channel 4 's Ways to Change the World went viral. " The double agent for the patriarchy is basically just a woman who perhaps unknowingly is still putting the patriarchal narrative out into the world, is still benefiting off, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women, " she said. " You are selling us something that really does n't make us feel good... You 're recycling hatred. " <p> From there Jamil has continued to be outspoken about her feelings regarding the famous family on her popular social media accounts. While the Kardashians have not directly responded( or, as the blogs would say, " clapped back "), Khlo? Kardashian seemed to address some of Jamil 's criticisms -- specifically about Khlo? ' s promotion of Flat Tummy shakes -- in a March New York Timesinterview, explaining she has never had a chef, and shares her workouts on Snapchat.( " Well, listen, I am showing you what to do, silly person, 15 repetitions, three times, here 's the move... ") <p> Jamil continues to weigh in on the family 's ventures : last week, when Kim Kardashian West promoted her new body-makeup line, Jamil tweeted, " Hard pass... I 'd rather just make peace with my million stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not had to address Jamil or her concerns in a direct manner, and it is hard to know if there has been any sort of impact in a business sense, but the attention being paid to their endorsements and product lines as a result of Jamil 's speaking out certainly do n't make them the winner here! <p> Winner : Given Jamil 's commitment to Kardashian-monitoring on a near-weekly basis, we will say the winner is blogs on the lookout for content. <p> -- Josh Duboff <p> Beauty Dramageddon Goes Mainstream <p> Who : Beauty YouTubers James Charles and Tati Westbrook <p> When : May 2019 <p> What : Charles, a 20-year-old vlogger best known for being Covergirl 's first male spokesmodel, angered his friend Westbrook, the 37-year-old owner of a vitamin company, when he endorsed a rival supplement brand in a post from Coachella. This being tantamount to murder in the makeup community, she responded with a 43-minute video accusing Charles of sexually harassing straight men, among crimes against beauty code. Within a week the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than twice the number of people who watched the finale of Game of Thrones), and Charles began hemorrhaging followers -- he even lost the Kardashian-Jenner clan. Other beauty YouTubers rushed to join the pileup, filming their own long, fascinating, and bizarre reaction videos. Charles laid low, receipts called the sexual harassment allegations into question, and by the end of the month, he was back and posing with Kylie Jenner. <p> Loser : The broader public, which watched this unfold over millions of minutes in the course of a week. <p> Winner : The feud was good for " influencer representation in the media, " as Charles once described his appearance at the 2019 Met Gala. <p> What : Stars have long pushed back against criticism of all kinds. It 's not new or anything. But at the end of April, a weather pattern of righteousness must have blown across the country, because something was in the air. Lizzo was subtweeting a Pitchfork review : " PEOPLE WHO ' REVIEW ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " Bieber was calling an E! News host by name after she criticized his performance with Ariana Grande at Coachella. Grande was supporting him, saying stuff like, " One day everybody that works at all them blogs will realize how unfulfilled they are and purposeless what they 're doing is... i ca n't wait for them to feel lit inside, " before deleting it. " Bloggers " responded by opening up a littlewindowinto their( our) therapy sessions. Mostly everyone cooled it, and the stars went back to the anti-blogger strategy that works : doing all the interviews at major magazines with their friends instead of with writers.
