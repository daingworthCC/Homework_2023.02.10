2005341 Like he did in Six Degrees of Separation, Will Smith gets to spread his acting wings well beyond comedy in his latest film, the action epic Independence Day. Smith is cast as a Marine pilot out to help save planet Earth when it becomes obvious that we are NOT alone. In the film, on a typical summer day, strange things begin to happen all over the planet as an enormous spaceship suddenly begins to hover over entire cities. Soon violence, terror and panic ensues. Something out there has decided to attempt to destroy the planet during the Fourth of July weekend. The planet 's only hope is a mixture of diverse people united by fate and bizarre circumstances. Smith plays Captain Steven Hiller, enlisted to help lead the effort to stave off the horrifying invaders. He described the film by saying, " Thrills, chills, spills. You 'll laugh, you 'll cry. You never know who 's gon na die. This is a disaster film in the classic sense of the genre with a great, massive cast, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to be around at the end of the film. These types of films have n't been made much recently, but I grew up watching them, and it 's fun to be in one. " He described Hiller as " interesting because he 's definitely serious, but he 's also able to be funny. I 've never experimented with that before. It 's either been one or the other. " The movie also marks the first time Smith has played a military officer. As a result, before filming began he studied the basics of flying by taking a spin in the Marines ' simulator, a device that mimics the rhythm and patterns of an airborne fighter jet.

" Photograph A Jasmine tightly clutches her son Dylan as they find themselves in the aftermath of a deadly attack on the planet. // Like Smith, Ms. Fox had to do a little preparation before filming got underway. She worked out with a trainer and spent a month with a professional stripper in Los Angeles. " I worked out everyday at a strip joint. She( the stripper) taught me how to do many things. I learned some great dance moves I did n't know before. " Ms. Fox, who performed on NBC 's short-lived " Out All Night, " also gueststarred on Smith 's long-running sitcom ' he Fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ esh Prince ' episode five years ago. Will was crazy then, and he 's crazy now, " she said. " People love Will Smith. He 's a really good person. " Making the movie even more home-like for Smith was the casting of Ross Bagley as Jasmine 's son, Dylan. Bagley was a regular cast member of " Fresh Prince. " He told JET, " I did n't know Will was in the movie until I saw him in the room getting fitted. I said, ' I ca n't believe it. ' Bagley observed that Smith was different working on a big-screen project. " On Fresh Prince ' Will was real silly. On Independence Day he was more serious but still fun. I had a whole lot of fun doing the movie. We had a big dog who was really smart. " A precocious seven-year-old, Ross said he immediately noticed the differences in the characters he played. " On Fresh Prince ' my character was a rich kid in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have much money but a lot of love. I like them both. I had love in both of them. " Bagley 's Independence Day experience has him now crossing his fingers that he will soon get a dog of his own. The film also featured Jeff Goldblum, Mary McDonnell, Bill Pullman, Judd Hirsch, Randy Quaid, Robert Loggia, Harry Connick Jr., James Rebhorn and Harvey Fierstein. Dean Devlin, who served as producer and writer, said " Roland( Emmerich, his co-writer) and I grew up watching the early films of Steven Spielberg, he in Germany and me in America. And we loved those big, dazzling adventures-entertainment that is best suited for the big screen, movies that just rock you and which ca n't be found in another medium. We 're also fans of the disaster films of the 1970s, and as we were talking about the kinds of films we do n't get to see anymore, we thought it would be great to revive that genre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, played by Jeff Goldblum( 1), map out a strategy to save the planet. Fighter pilots Hiller and Jimmy, played by Harry Connick Jr., get briefed on the deadly mission they are about to undertake. // Devlin called Smith, Goldblum and Pullman " the triumvirate... Each of these actors used their unique strengths to emphasize these three elements( brains, heart and soul). I do n't think these aspects were in the script ; I think they originated in the performances. Jeff Goldblum, as the genius who unravels the invaders ' code, has impressive leading man qualities and is terrific at playing brilliant, quirky characters. Will Smith was clearly the heart of the picture, and he pushed that aspect way beyond anything he 'd ever done before, becoming a really strong, romantic lead. And there 's Bill Pullman 's president, the ' soul ' of the picture, a man of honor who has to make tough decisions. " Fox told JET that she had to really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got stereotyped from playing the hoity-toity type on Out All Night. ' And I had trouble getting seen because I did n't have a name. I had to audition six times. I worked hard. It came down to me and Lela Rochon. She had done Waiting to Exhale and had a name. " But Ms. Fox 's perseverance paid off, and she said the public will see a very different side of her and will be impressed with the full ensemble cast in an exciting film. " What 's so great about this film is that it 's not Black or White. It 's universal, " she said. <p>
