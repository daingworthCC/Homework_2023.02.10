2028041 Section : 85 Years &; Ideas FLOPS Many innovations flopped before they could get to market. Some ideas should never have been tried. But the inventive spirit refuses to give up <p> With the spectacular collapse of so many dot-coms over the last couple of years, it 's easy to forget that the history of American invention is a huge collection of failed ideas, some brilliant and unlucky, many febrile and plain idiotic. Passenger space travel may happen some day. Towing icebergs to drought-stricken areas probably wo n't. Aspirations, along with bad ideas, never die. Trial -- and lots of error -- is embedded in entrepreneurship. The impulse to change the world for the better can as easily result in a breakthrough as a humiliating, and expensive, defeat. Flying Cars <p> The dream of every commuter trapped in traffic, the " Flying Flivver " was Ford Motor Co. ' s prototype single-seat plane, introduced in 1926. A stubby craft with wings that resemble dachshund ears, it never went into production, coming to an abrupt end after Harry Brooks, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the Miami coast. <p> That did n't end the dream. Aviation enthusiast and Bureau of Air Commerce chief Eugene Vidal( father of novelist Gore Vidal) offered government grants to manufacturers of a " poor man 's airplane " -- one that could be had for $700 back in the 1930s. Inventor Waldo Waterman took him up on the offer in 1936 and built a small plane with removable wings, a clutch and a transmission, called the Waterman Arrowbile. It actually flew through the air and rumbled over roads, but did n't fly as well as the average plane nor drive as well as the average car. Waterman never mass-produced the thing and no one has since found a market for an aerial roadster. <p> And yet. Two months ago, at the Texas State Fair, inventor Paul Moller displayed his Skycar, a vertical takeoff-and-landing craft with a cockpit seating four and four nacelles that house eight rotary engines. " The automobile, " he says, " is only an interim step on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Forty years before fax machines became ubiquitous, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch sent out 15 copies of its nine-page-long " radio edition " to a test group. A printer hooked up to an RCA radio transcribed articles onto a rolled sheet of paper. During the 1940s the New York Times, the Sacramento Bee, the Chicago Tribune and the Miami Herald all faxed abridged daily editions of their paper to radio listeners. Why bother? You could get the latest news without being tied to the living room and your Philco. <p> Advertisers never went for it, so newspapers had to eat the costs of receivers( the Bee spent $75,000 in ten months of fax publishing in 1939). During World War II the government took control of most of the radio spectrum used for fax papers and killed momentum for the idea -- except for the Miami Herald, which dropped $24,000 in 1948. Videophones <p> In 1931 AT &T; set up a two-way visual conversation between its headquarters and Bell Labs, about a mile apart in Manhattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while a separate TV feed brought video from one 2-inch-wide screen to the other. <p> Ma Bell showed up at the New York World 's Fair in 1964 with the Videophone as the centerpiece of its pavilion. A hit with fairgoers, it needed work( the video display was wider than it was tall). Four years later AT &T; began field trials in Chicago and Pittsburgh, signing up 300 users who paid $160 a month for equipment rental and 30 minutes of talking time. The project was shelved in 1974, after AT &T; gave up trying to figure out how to sell a service that 's worthless to callers unless their friends and families buy it, too. <p> Internet conferencing -- at a fraction of the cost of AT &T's; system -- might be its final incarnation. 3-D Movies <p> A 1953 Warner Bros. horror film called House of Wax typifies the 3-D genre : Vincent Price rebuilds his wax museum after a fire by covering human bodies in wax. Blind in one eye, director Andr de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If history is a judge, he did n't miss anything. There were 27 3-D films released in 1953, mostly horror or sci-fi. Since 1960 only 54 3-D films have been foisted on moviegoers. <p> The technology behind sending limbs, actors and sharks lunging out of the movie screen was n't even that new. The technique made its premiere in three short films at Manhattan 's Astor Place Theater in 1915. <p> As the 3-D fad waned in 1960, producer Michael Todd Jr. tried to take the moviegoer into the fourth dimension. Not time. Smell. His film, Scent of a Mystery( with Peter Lorre as a dirty old man named Smiley), was the premiere and finale of Smell-O-Vision, in which odors were pumped into the theater from the projection room at pre-established cues. Director John Waters sent up the concept by having scratch-and-sniff cards passed out with tickets at his 1981 film, Polyester. Nuclear Bombs as Steam Shovels <p> It sounds improbably stupid, but in 1957 the Atomic Energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peaceful uses for nuclear explosives. " Before ending the program in 1977, Uncle Sam had spent $700 million. <p> In 1958 Edward Teller, a creator of the hydrogen bomb, suggested using nuclear explosions to dig a harbor near Cape Thompson, Alaska. On a tour of the region, where he stumped for " Project Chariot, " Teller told residents that the explosions would be so precise that they could dig the harbor into the shape of a polar bear. <p> Panama also found itself on the Plowshare target list. The 50-year-old Panama Canal had proven too small for the supertankers of the day. The U.S. wanted to build a new waterway though Panama 's Darin province ; nothing short of a nuclear blast could cut through the flooded rain forests and 1,000-foot-high mountains. <p> A voluntary nuclear test ban between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in 1958 kept the Alaska and Panama projects from entering the testing phase. When the Soviets ended the agreement in 1961, the U.S. blew a 1,280-foot-wide crater into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Limited Test Ban Treaty prohibited any nuclear explosion that sent radioactivity over a nation 's borders. Panama and Alaska were spared by having neighbors. Interactive Television <p> Warner Cable brought the first interactive TV system to Columbus, Ohio in 1977. The Qube came with an 18-button remote control and a cable box that sent and received data at 256K per second, five times the speed of a 56K modem. Subscribers got access to 30 channels, including pay-per-view movies. Three years later American Express invested $175 million to form Warner-Amex Cable, offering the Qube in Dallas. The company spent $23 million to get 50,000 subscribers in Columbus. But viewers were turned off by the higher prices : $40 for a standard cable box and $200 for the Qube. <p> Warner-Amex cable built out the Qube network in eight communities, until American Express sold its stake to Warner for $450 million after a disastrous year in 1983 in which the partnership lost $150 million. Warner Cable started boxing up the Qube in 1984. Unlimited Solar Power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get solar power. The atmosphere filters out most of the sun 's radiation and at night there 's no sun at all. In 1968 Peter Glaser, a consultant who had managed projects on NASA lunar missions, suggested solar power collectors could be sent into outer space, where the sun 's rays are unfettered. Power could be converted into an electromagnetic beam and sent back to Earth. <p> So in the 1970s NASA and the Energy Department spent $20 million on a grand plan : 60 orbiting satellites would infuse the U.S. electric grid with 300 gigawatts of electricity. But a new fleet of shuttles to place and maintain the satellites was the costly impediment. Price tag : $108 billion. <p> NASA still has n't given up. Since renewing the solar power collecting satellite program in 1999, it 's dropped about $25 million on Glaser 's vision. <p> PHOTO( BLACK &; WHITE) : Convertible : The Arrowbile could drive and fly. <p> PHOTO( BLACK &; WHITE) : The first Videophone display was palm-size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction? <p> PHOTO( BLACK &; WHITE) : 3-D flopped : Audiences prefer flat screens. <p> By Michael Maiello <p>
