4108241 With the July 31 deadline approaching, a search for the top trade chips did n't go too far past the mound <p> FRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ, RP, METS <p> It appeared early this season that the Mets would be stuck with Rodriguez because of his enormous contract and a $17.5 million option for next season that vests if he finishes 55 games- which he is on pace to do. Plus, he has a no-trade clause. But Rodriguez reportedly has said he 'll consider any trade offer and could even waive the vesting option if a team is willing to negotiate a new multiyear deal. Plus, the Mets could sweeten the deal by offering to pick up the $3.5 million Rodriguez is guaranteed for next season. <p> Potential destinations : The Rangers could use Rodriguez as a setup man this season, then make htm the closer next season and move Neftali Feliz into the rotation. The Cardinals are also in need of a closer. <p> HEATHBELL, RP, PADRES <p> Bell 's name has been mentioned in trade rumors since the final game of last season, and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Diego, a trade might be unavoidable. Bell can become a free agent after this season, and the money he 'll command on the open market is far greater than what the Padres can offer. " I personally love the person, love the player( Bell is), " Padres CEO Jeff Moorad says. " I hope he can be here for a long time, but at the end of the day it will be a baseball decision. " <p> Potential destinations : The Rangers, Cardinals and Phillies are shopping for a closer, and all could afford to re-sign Bell next winter. <p> WANDY RODRIGUEZ, SP, ASTROS <p> Hunter Pence is virtually untouchable, which makes Rodriguez the most appealing Astros trade chip, especially considering his ERA was 2.11 after the All-Star break last season.

He is a proven All-Star-caliber pitcher and is under team control through 2014. If the Royals see a potential haul in return, they should n't hesitate to deal him. <p> Potential destinations : Given that Soria 's contract wo n't cost a ton, the White Sox, whose bullpen troubles have been well-documented, might be willing to gamble on a rebound. <p> JASON KUBEL, OF, TWINS <p> Kubel is a corner outfielder with 20-homer, 90-RBI potential and wi be a free agent after this season.
