2027341 Section : COLLEGE AVENUE <p> THIS PAST SPRING, Stanley Rothman, S. Robert Lichter, and Neil Nevitte published a statistical study( " Politics and Professional Advancement among College Faculty, " The Forum : Vol. 3 : No. 1, Article 2) that argued for the presence of widespread ideological discrimination in higher education. The study surveyed 1,643 faculty members across the United States and found " that liberals and Democrats outnumber conservatives and Republicans by large margins. " Rothman et al. also found that conservatives and Republicans " teach at lower quality schools than do liberals and Democrats. " The authors concluded that " complaints of ideologically-based discrimination in academic advancement deserve serious consideration and further study. " <p> Scholars Barry Ames, David C. Barker, Chris W. Bonneau, and Christopher J. Carman responded with a critique of that study( " Hide the Republicans, the Christians, and the Women : A Response to ' Politics and Professional Advancement Among College Faculty, ' " The Forum : Vol. 3 : No. 2, Article 7), challenging the inference of discrimination and offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discrimination but from selfselection. <p> Self-selection is a deeply flawed explanation for the prevailing ideological imbalance on college campuses. Here 's the authors ' alternative hypothesis, followed by my analysis : <p> We offer self-selection as the likely culprit. First, there may be a rural/urban divide driving the relationship. Conservatives may want to live in communities whose ideological climate is more consistent with their own belief structure. Thus, given the strong correlation observable between the metropolitan density of a particular county and the mean conservatism of its citizens, it would not be surprising if conservatives, academic or otherwise, prefer to work in smaller, more rural areas. <p> Second, regional selection affects hiring. It is no secret that Midwesterners and, especially, Southerners are more conservative, more religious, and less Jewish than Northeasterners. <p> Third, many conservatives may deliberately choose not to seek employment at top-tier research universities because they object, on philosophical grounds, to one of the fundamental tenets undergirding such institutions : the scientific method.. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in large part from an embrace of Christian fundamentalism as a dominant worldview. Fundamentalism, by definition, is an absolutist, " faith-based " allegiance to a particular dogma, the veracity of which is considered beyond question or argument.. In other words, the faith based reasoning of Christian fundamentalism( and by extension, of most socio-cultural conservatives) is essentially incompatible with the mission of contemporary research universities. <p> The authors offer no evidence to support these explanations, which, on examination, are unpersuasive. I will consider each element in turn. Rural/Urban Divide : The authors argue that conservatives prefer to live in more rural areas and so will be disproportionately found at schools in such areas. If this is so, then an easy test of the hypothesis presents itself. My beloved alma mater Dartmouth College is one of two rural institutions in the Ivy League( Cornell is the other). It is also in New Hampshire, historically the most conservative of the northeastern states. If the authors are correct about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more conservatives on the Dartmouth faculty than at urban-situated Ivy League schools, such as Harvard, Columbia, Penn, or Brown. A recent examination of party identification, however, finds that 66 percent of Dartmouth professors are Democrats and the ratio of registered Democrats to Republicans is 12.5 to 1, comparable to the ratios at urban Ivy League and other elite institutions. This is just one data point, of course, but it casts doubt on the idea that conservative academics have an unusual pro-rural preference. The situation at the University of Chicago, a rare institution with a historic reputation for a conservative presence, suggests that there exist counter-examples in the opposite direction as well. Regional Selection : The authors argue that the South is disproportionately conservative, and as a result, conservatives might self-select for Southern schools. Again, the testable hypothesis here is that elite schools in the South should attract a disproportionate number of faculty conservatives relative to similarly prestigious schools in more liberal areas of the country. The only case study I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unquestionably one of the most prestigious institutions in the South. But according to one survey of eight of Duke 's humanities departments( " DCU sparks varied reactions, " The Chronicle Online, February 10, 2004), Duke has 142 registered Democrats and eight registered Republicans( 17.75 to 1). The Duke History Department pitched a 32-0 Democratic shutout. Again, this is just one sample and only of humanities departments, but it lends little support for the conclusion that conservative professors are disproportionately drawn from and prefer to remain in the South. More generally, do we really think that rural Midwestern small colleges( the three factors the authors identify) like Oberlin, Grinnell, and Kenyon are overrun with conservative faculty? Willingness to Apply the Scientific Method : The fact that the authors would propose this explanation, seemingly with a straight face, is evidence of the straw-grasping going on here. But I will treat it as a serious hypothesis for the sake of argument. The authors argue that conservatism draws from fundamentalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Again, this is subject to testing. If conservatives are hostile to the scientific method, then the disparity in ideology should be greatest in those fields where the scientific method is strongest -- mathematics and hard sciences. By contrast, the gap should be narrower where the scientific method is least relevant, such as in the humanities. <p> Again, the available data do not seem to support this hypothesis. In fact, the ideological gap is much narrower in those fields where the scientific method is most relevant. Consider this summary by Yevgeny Vilensky( April 6, 2005, blogger.com) of another study, which found the following ratios of liberal/conservative identifications among faculty members in math and science departments : <p> Mathematics : 4.1 to 1 <p> Physics : 6 to 1 <p> Chemistry : 2.2 to 1 <p> Biology : 4.4 to 1 <p> Computer Science : 2.8 to 1 <p> Engineering : 2.6 to 1 <p> Economics : 1.4 to 1 <p> In the humanities and social science departments, the following divides were found : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7.7 to 1 <p> Philosophy : 16 to 1 <p> Theology/Religion : 16.6 to 1 <p> Political Science : 40.5 to 1 <p> Sociology : 8.6 to 1 <p> Psychology : 10.5 to 1 <p> So, the ideological divide is much narrower in the fields where the scientific method is used( including Economics), and widest where it is most absent. More fundamentally, Ames et al. are simply incorrect to argue that the religious beliefs of conservatives make them unable to apply the scientific method. As Larry Summers of Harvard learned the hard way, modern-day political correctness is a faith just as strong as, if not stronger than, religious faith. Summers 's great heresy was to suggest that certain faith-based tenets of the modern academy could be subjected to testing by the scientific method. Make no mistake about it : The orthodoxy of political correctness is just as at odds with the scientific method as traditional religious belief. The only difference, of course, is that traditional religion is shunned in the modern academy, while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE AUTHORS ALSO CLAIM that " it is difficult even to imagine ideological discrimination occurring at the point of hiring. " This navet demonstrates the authors ' blind spot occasioned by their own narrow worldview. There is a multitude of ways in which ideological discrimination manifests itself in hiring. The most obvious is simply the degree of skepticism that incumbent faculty apply to a given scholar 's work. If they disagree with the ideological conclusions of the work, liberal faculty approach it with greater skepticism and a higher burden of proof, and thereby it is easier to conclude that the analysis is flawed or incomplete. Again, this difference is reflected in the fact that the more subjective subjects( Philosophy, History, English, etc.) have greater ideological disparities than less subjective subjects where standards of scholarly rigor are better established and have an independent integrity that separates the craftsmanship of the field from the conclusions. <p> I would say that if there is self-selection here, it is of precisely one type -- libertarian and conservative students self-select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of the political obstacles that will be placed in their way. It is also likely that conservatives, even if not blocked by discrimination, are disproportionately turned off by the fundamental " unseriousness " of the modern academy : the emptiness and triviality of so much modern scholarship( especially in the humanities), the restraints on free inquiry, the whole edifice of the diversity machine. <p> When it comes to addressing the issue of other " underrepresented minorities " on college campuses, college administrators do not simply throw up their hands and complain of a shallow talent pool. At Columbia, for instance, the diversity committee is " tasked with finding ways to strengthen the pipeline bringing women and minority students into the University 's undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral programs. " <p> I think it is time to take even a small percentage of those tens of millions being spent at places like Columbia and conduct a study of the causes of the ideological disparity in the academy, rather than simply speculate and pontificate. At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the more preposterous hypotheses -- such as self-selection -- for the under-representation of conservatives in academia. <p> By Todd Zywicki <p> <p> Todd Zywicki is professor of law at George Mason University School of Law, member of the board of trustees of Dartmouth College, and blogs at the Volokh Conspiracy, www.volokh.com. <p>
