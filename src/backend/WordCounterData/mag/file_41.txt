2005541 Wesley Snipes has done it several times in movies. So has Laurence Fishburne. Even Whitney Houston and Lela Rochon have done it. If it 's still taboo, they 've all committed the forbidden act of kissing Whites in films. Hollywood makes no secret that it is n't big on interracial romance on the big screen, especially when it comes to Black men kissing White women. Yet that has n't deterred Black actors from braving these roles anyway. Wesley Snipes does n't believe that it 's taboo for Blacks and Whites to kiss in movies. In Spike Lee 's controversial 1991 movie Jungle Fever, Snipes cheats on his Black wife with a White co-worker in the dramatic film. Six years later Snipes stepped on the edge once more when he was the leading man in the film One Night Stand. In this particular movie, Snipes goes all out. Not only does he cheat with a White woman( Nastassja Kinski), but also his character is married to an Asian woman( MingNa Wen). The heck with interracial movie taboos. Snipes said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the movie, which won him the best actor award at the Venice Film Festival. Photograph A Wesley Snipes did n't mind kissing Annabella Sciorra in Jungle Fever. Photograph Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner shared a tender kiss in the box-office hit The Bodyguard. The film marked Houston 's remarkable big-screen debut. // " Early on there were concerns about the Black community reminiscing to Jungle Fever and missing the point of the story, " Snipes told EBONY. " So we did n't want to go that route. And I 've done a lot of movies where I 've had White women as my co-stars. That would have been kind of redundant. So I said, Well, let me go either Spanish or Asian. That 's something unusual. ' Laurence Fishburne is another actor who does n't shy away from a role where he 'll have a White lover. He 's appeared in the 1995 movie Bad Company, where he engaged in smoldering love scenes with Ellen Barkin, and later that same year he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movie of the same name.

Photograph A Lela Rochon and Timothy Hutton married in Showtime 's Mr. and Mrs. Loving. // Whitney Houston 's silver screen debut in The Bodyguard blew interracial taboos right out of the water. The hugely successful film transcended race, teaming her up with Kevin Costner in the 1992 box-office smash. Lela Rochon 's kisses and loving were so good in 1989 's Harlem Nights as the worldly character Sunshine that it made her White lover call his wife on the phone and tell her that he was never returning home! In 1996 Rochon starred opposite Timothy Hutton in the Showtime movie, Mr. and Mrs. Loving.

Photograph A Nastassja Kinski and Snipes had an affair in last year 's movie One Night Stand. // Denzel Washington is very selective when choosing roles with interracial story lines. He takes into account who his audience might be. " They cut a kissing scene between me and Mimi Rogers out of The Mighty Quinn because of audience reaction at test screenings, " Washington told the Chicago SunTimes. " Black women hated the scene. White men hated the scene. " So, when he appeared with Kelly Lynch in the 1995 futuristic thriller Virtuosity, Washington remembered his audience. Lynch told the Chicago Sun-Times that she begged Washington to have their characters kiss. " He felt very strongly about it, " Lynch told the newspaper. " I felt there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly that the White males, who were the target audience of this movie, would not want to see him kiss a White woman.

Photograph Dennis Haysbert and Michelle Pfeiffer were intimate in Love Field. // Washington 's observance of his audience possibly could have led to changing the plot for the movie The Pelican Brief, which co-starred Julia Roberts. When John Grisham 's bestselling novel was made into a movie in 1993, the movie 's main characters, Washington and Roberts, did not have the romance written in the novel. In Spike Lee 's upcoming drama, He Got Game, Washington does, however, cross the line when his convict character kisses a White prostitute. Washington told the Chicago Sun-Times of Black women 's reaction to the scene, " I hear Black women stood up and yelled, Denzel, you promised! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that when the audience sees a love scene on film, they put themselves up there. It 's like Tom Cruise or Denzel is kissing you. So in a certain way, I belong to these women, and they had a spontaneous reaction to the kiss. " The interracial storyline in the movie version of the best-seller Kiss The Girls, by James Patterson, was also changed. In the book Dr. Alex Cross( Morgan Freeman) and Alex McTiernan( Ashley Judd) had a romantic relationship. When the novel was made into a movie last year, the romance was axed. Lisa Bonet, who played in the old " The Cosby Show " series, was n't afraid to kiss Mickey Rourke in the seductive movie Angel Heart in 1987. The film caused quite a stir due to its heated love scenes between the two.
