Photograph CHIC AND ROOMY : The 30 's galley, dinette and forward berth. // You could call it a best-of-both-worlds boat. The new Maxum 3000 Sun Cruiser-the not-so-little sister of the 4100 SCR opposite-offers many of its sibling 's yacht-like features, including a surprising amount of living space for its size. It emulates the 41 's stylish looks, elegant appointments, luxurious amenities, nice ride, quality construction and long list of standard itemswhile also boasting the speed and agility of a sportboat. In short, it packs a lot of bang for the buck. I boarded the 30 through the port-side transom door from the integrated swim platform with retractable ladder, noting that there 's a convenient molded boarding step from the side-deck as well. A pair of transom lockers hold the boat 's standard dockside power cord, fenders and transom shower. The large cockpit 's centerfacing U-lounge with removable table seats four to six people and converts to a sun lounge with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flip-up seat that opens to a locker holding a standard portable cooler. To port is a wet bar with attractive Avonite countertop, molded sink, storage cabinets, and adjacent row of beverage holders. All the outdoor seating, most of which has storage underneath, is upholstered in 30ounce marine-grade vinyl. A snap-in carpet, Bimini top and camper enclosure are standard. The boat 's roomy stepin engine compartment, under a hatch on gas struts, has space to add an optional generator and air conditioner. The 30 's double-wide helm seat with adjustable driver 's side provides great visibility and convenient reach to the mahogany/burlwood tilt wheel and righthand engine controls with drive-trim thumb switches, linked to trim indicators on the dash. The sporty-looking nonglare two-tiered dashboard features simulated-burlwood panels with easy-to-read gauges and rubber rocker systems switches arrayed in two neat rows. A Horizon VHF, Lowrance depthfinder, Danforth compass and Bennett trim tabs are all standard.

The integrated bow pulpit has a recessed anchoring platform with anchor roller, and there 's a double sunpad on the foredeck. The boat 's bowand grabrails, as well as deck fittings, are all stainless steel and are throughbolted with backing plates. Elegantly appointed A port-side hatch leads to the elegantly appointed cabin, which has an extremely generous amount of space and headroom for a 30-footer. Plenty of light and air flow from three overhead hatches and six portlights, all screened, as well as numerous light fixtures. The impression of roominess is further enhanced by the openness of the layout and the cleverly angled forward berth and dinette areas. There are sleeping accommodations for six people-on the UltraLeather convertible dinette with removable Avonite-topped table ; on the convertible mid-cabin U-lounge with removable table and accordion privacy door ; and in the forward berth area, with accordion privacy door and shelf for an optional TV. A four-speaker stereo system is standard. Under-seat and underberth storage is plentiful throughout. On the port side is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink, pressure hot/cold water, microwave oven, two-burner Origo alcohol/electric stovetop, Norcold dual-voltage refrigerator/freezer, trashbag dispenser and plentiful storage. The molded-fiberglass head, aft of the dinette, includes an MSD, shower with curtain, molded sink and mirrored cabinet. When powered by a pair of 220-hp 5.7L EFI MerCruisers with Alpha One drives( a popular alternative, for an extra $11,600, to the standard single 300-hp 7.4L Merc), the 3000 has a reported cruising speed of 36 mph and a top end of 44 to 47 mph. The boat 's 18-degree transom deadrise helps ensure a smooth ride in choppy seas. Like its siblings, the 3000 features a patented MaxuPlane hull with highquality hand-laid fiberglass construction under a flawless gelcoat, and comes with a transferable five-year structural hull limited warranty-and it 's a great value. -POLLY WHITTELL // Maxum 3000 SCR // <p>
