4153041 Section : Departments # A new microscope sweeps lattices of light over samples to give scientists sneak peeks inside living cells without hurting them. # Scientists have previously devised ways to glimpse the hidden machinery of cells, but spying the tiny nuts and bolts in action is tricky. Shining light on cells for too long can bleach their color and even kill them. So 2014 chemistry Nobel Prizewinner Eric Betzig of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute 's Janelia Research Campus in Ashburn, Va., and colleagues tweaked a technique to see cells ' innards( SN Online : 10/8/14). Instead of shooting a focused beam of light at a developing embryo or a virus infecting a cell, the scientists spread the beam out into a grid. # Breaking up the beam dials down the light 's intensity and protects cells, the researchers report in the Oct. 24 Science. Using this lattice light-sheet microscope, the scientists were able to watch as a cancer cell navigated through a sticky thicket of protein and as an immune cell( shown in orange) stretched out and glommed on to another @ @ @ @ @ @
