5010941 <h> Drivers of hate in the U.S. have distinct regional differences <p> In a new study, University of Utah geographers sought to understand the factors fueling hate across space. Their findings paint a rather grim reality of America ; hate is a national phenomenon, and more complicated than they imagined. <p> The researchers mapped the patterns of active hate groups in every U.S. county in the year 2014, and analyzed their potential socioeconomic and ideological drivers. <p> They found that in all U.S. regions, less education, population change, and ethnic diversity correlated with more hate groups, as did areas with higher poverty rates and more conservative political affiliation. The magnitude of the drivers had regional differences, however. The regional variation of the proposed drivers of hate may be a result of diverse ethnic and cultural histories. One surprising finding is that the geographical region seemed to determine whether religion has a positive or negative relative effect on the number of hate groups for the county. <p> The U geographers assert that organized hate is motivated by the desire to protect a place from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socioeconomic security. The contemporary expression, ' hate, ' is shaped by the intermingling histories and present-day conditions of a place. <p> " There is a lot of uncertainty in the country today, and a lot of change. For those involved in hate group activities, they see their actions as a way to secure the future of their people. Unfortunately, that fear turns to hate, and in the worst case, violence, " said Richard Medina, assistant professor in the Department of Geography at the U, and senior author of the study. <p> The relative effect of four socioeconomic factors on the number of hate groups per 1,000 people for US counties in 2014. Red indicates that the factor has a positive effect on the number of hate groups in the county, blue indicates that the variable has a negative effect on the number of hate groups in the county, and a darker shade indicates a stronger effect.

" <p> The study published online in the Annals of the American Association of Geographers on Feb. 9, 2018. <p> A grim reality <p> " When thinking about hate and place, it really boils down to thinking about identity, " said Emily Nicolosi, co-author and doctoral student at the U. " Some people have strong feelings about who belongs, and who does n't belong in ' their ' place. When they see people coming in that they think do n't belong, their very identity feels threatened. " <p> A hate group is an organized group or ideology with beliefs or practices that malign an entire class of people due to their immutable characteristics, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center( SPLC). Whether it be their race, gender, religion, ethnicity, disability, or sexual orientation, a hate group expresses prejudice against people with a particular identity. Though hate has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hate groups in the United States, according to the SPLC. There is still much to learn about how Americans hate, and why. <p> The relative effect of ideological factors on the number of hate groups per 1,000 people for US counties in 2014. Credit : Richard Medina adapted from Medina et al., 2018, Taylor &amp; Francis 2018 <p> The researchers mapped active hate groups for every U.S. county using the SPLC database from 2014. They compared the relationships between these groups with the county 's socioeconomic factors, meant to represent diversity, poverty, education level and population stability, and ideological factors, represented as religion and degree of conservativism. <p> " People hate for different reasons because U.S. regions have different situations and histories. For example, the Northeast is a place of power that may be seen as elitist and well-educated. Is there still hate? Yes. Some of the reasons people hate there are different than in the South, where there 's a different history of the Confederacy, of discrimination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While this is not the first study to quantify hate groups at the county level, it is one of the first to look more regionally and analyze variations in space explicitly. Previous research has focused on why people hate, but all populations are typically analyzed together in a national model. Until now, the drivers of hate have never been differentiated for specific places. <p> What 's next? <p> Medina and Nicolosi want to analyze the differences between different types of hate groups, and whether hate groups are linked to violent behavior. <p> " First and foremost, I want our paper to help people understand how much we do n't know about hate -- hate is not a uniform phenomenon. Hopefully this study motivates people to start asking more questions, especially right now, " said Medina. " We have a long way to go before we really understand the drivers and patterns of hate in this country.

Lack of experience with racial and cultural differences and friction it causes means the " eastern liberals " really have no solid foundation upon which to base their opinions. <p> Poor inhabitants are most physically threatened by lost of occupation, for example as the result of wrong immigration politics. This is something, which people with higher social status can not understand. But I would n't call this hate - just the result of pure conflict of interests. In similar way the rich people hate these who prohibits them in filling the market by cheap labor force. The labeling these feelings as irrational does n't help the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dancing around to find yet not find " Culture " which is pretty much what they are trying to describe. Yet because Culture has a quasi-genetic definition. Which in our present Culture, is verboten. I read somewhere that " Brown vs the Board " decision also declared that there is only Nurture, not Nature. And that we are stuck in a Behaviorist society.Wrong. " Black Lives Matter " is an expression of the desire of that group to maintain their culture. As do St.Patrick day parades, the Indian, Hawaiian etc " Ways of Life ". Hate will emerge when this identity is threatened. As is happening in the great homogenization of our current PC culture. But the reaction to a cultural threat is as real as to a physical threat.The place to look for which groups hate is to look at where existential threats to that groups identity is strongest. <p> They found that in all U.S. regions, less education, population change, and ethnic diversity correlated with more hate groups, as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affiliation. <p> Notice that the authors specifically mentioned conservative political views as a cause of hate while never mentioning liberal political views. If you doubt that liberals hate, you need only to have seen the recent state of the union address and watched the hate dripping from the liberals. <p> @dogbert : It was liberals, of course, who founded America on the concept of Liberty. It was conservatives who supported the British. Two hundred years later, they still do, only substitute Russian fascism for British toryism. You need to reconsider your loyalties. <p> What liberals really hate is slavery, poverty, ignorance and of course, bigots.( Is hating bigots a form of bigotry?) <p> If the author is properly synopsizing this paper then the paper is worse than trash. It utilizes of the Southern Poverty Law Center. Go to https : //www.splcenter.org/ and see some of their 917 hate groups. People who believe in the support of marriage are on the list. The Southern Poverty Law Center 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean girl 's burn book. Citing the SPLC is equivalent to praising the KKK as a community organizer group. The parody in Blues Brothers movie makes a parody of media hyped hate groups. There is an amazing and thought provoking look into hate( or not hate) and behavior of violence against members of a community available at https : //www.youtu... QI6zl-c. This is not a Holocaust event. <p> Anyone notice how it 's always the Antifa mobs and the BLM mobs who burn, loot and generally threaten anyone who is n't " with them "? Violence is their first go-to tactic. And how about the Jew-hate that flows unremarked throughout all modern world liberalism? It sometimes actually seems that the left is trying to provoke some sort of civil war in America. If they ever succeed, I have a feeling they 're in for a helluva unpleasant surprise. <p> 1066 you are correct. What never fails to amaze me is the number of Jewish liberals that support movements that are anti-semite. They will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> From the Abstract : " Linear and spatial filtering with eigenvector( SFE) models are used to infer relationships between socioeconomic and ideological variables and the number of hate groups within U.S. counties.

A start would be religious revival history of the 1740s and foundation of the English relationship. It was the Brits that did the most to end slavery. <p> " It sometimes actually seems that the left is trying to provoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever succeed, I have a feeling they 're in for a helluva unpleasant surprise. " <p> This is all part of the plan to burn Western culture to the ground and resurrect from its ashes the New World Order aka the One World Government. That is the liberal cause that they are willing to sacrifice us for. Remember, in their mind the end always justifies the means and 10s of millions of deaths are a small price to pay for this goal. <p> It is pretty much obvious that the all wars in the ME are part of that plan. Bush and Obama had the same goal and were puppets of the same master. The mass migration into Europe shows the power of the plan and the ignorance and/or complacency of Europeans in general. Soon they will have no rights at all, not even the right to THINK let alone express a non PC thought. There will be an implanted chip for that. Of course it will be for your own safety. <p> The problem the altright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Putin made the Trumpster the Bogus POTUS? The neocon-artists whined the " Original " Constitution should be reinstated. Carefully avoiding mentioning a specific version of that dynamic guideline. <p> Now, under the fascist occupation, the quislings just as carefully ignore all those embarrassing articles such as the First Amendment and the Emoluments Clause. <p> They glorify the rump half of the Second Amendment. Realizing that they could not pass the mental health tests to be permitted to join their official State Militias. <p> Several years ago, during the bombast over the revival of secession from the Federal Union. I just shrugged my shoulders. The secessionists predecessors were traitors a 160 years ago. They are traitors today. Their successors will be traitors a century from now. Ho-Hum, just the ebb and flow of American history. -cont'd- <p> RRW so far the only Russian collusion that has been proven is between Russia and the Democrats.

For example, many second amendment rights groups, even comparatively mainstream groups such as the NRA, have been labeled as " hate " groups. As such, any conclusion from the paper is no more impartial than the politics that created it. <p> Elliot Rodger, the 22-year-old who killed six minority students in the college town of Isla Vista in 2014, was the first " alt-right killer " to strike in recent years, according to a new report from the Southern Poverty Law Center.The report counts Rodger among 13 alt-right killers whose actions left 43 people dead and more than 60 injured since 2014. These are the kind of ' good people ' that Trump and Bannon 's fake populism appeals to.
