4106141 Author Alex Kotlowitz and Hoop Dreams director Steve James on their new documentary, The Interrupters <p> MOTHER JONES : Your film, which hits theaters this summer, was inspired by Alex 's New York Times Magazine piece on CeaseFire, a group that aims to stop the spread of violence by training former criminals to intervene in street feuds and convince people not to retaliate. What got you interested? <p> ALEX KOTLOWITZ : I was intrigued by the idea that violence mimics the transmission of infectious disease. What particularly excited me is that it took the morality out of the equation. It was n't a question of good and bad people ; it was really about behavior. <p> STEVE JAMES : Murders are down in Chicago, but Alex and I both felt that it had kind of settled into a place where the violence was accepted. I think we both hoped this film was a way of putting the issue more front and center. The thing that fascinated me most was just this notion of the interrupters as living, breathing examples of people who have profoundly changed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CeaseFire change a culture that encourages street justice? <p> SJ : That 's where the infectious thing is most appealing. If certain people act out, it can affect a larger group. And if violence can infect, then good behavior can also infect. <p> MJ : Steve, how did making this film compare with making Hoop Dreams? <p> SJ : I 've joked that this film was sort of like Hoop Dreams on steroids. I 've never had a project that 's this ambitious happen so quickly, and be, I 'm almost embarrassed to say, such a pleasurable experience, given the subject matter. <p> MJ : Encounter any hostility out there on the street? <p> SJ : Just on a couple of occasions, but given that we were with violence interrupters Eddie, Cobe, and Ameena, we felt pretty safe. <p> MJ : Do you think bringing a camera into these tense situations affects the outcome? <p> AK : The interrupters themselves rather quickly got comfortable with us filming them, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such admiration in their own neighborhoods, that they kind of set the tone. Cobe would just tell people, " Heyman, this is my film crew. " <p> MJ : The film is light on wonky details. How is CeaseFire weathering state budget cuts? <p> AK : During the course of filming, we saw the number of interrupters fluctuate anywhere between 20 to 50, depending on funding. They are doing okay, you know. They 've been replicated, or parts of it have been replicated, in about a dozen other cities. The ideathere 's something so commonsensical about it. You think, why have n't people done this before? -Michael Mechanic <p> Read the complete interview at **32;2697;TOOLONG interrupters.
