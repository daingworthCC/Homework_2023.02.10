2020941 Survive Your Family During the Holidays-for Real! A visit home with your family can be like a Christmas tree. It 's festive and inviting for a while, but after several days you may be walking on pins and needles. Unlike a tree, however, you ca n't throw your relatives out into the street when you 're tired of their mess. So, seriously, what can you do? Three experts in family therapy-Jeree Wade, M.A., Marlene F. Watson, Ph.D., and Gwendolyn Goldsby Grant, Ed.D. -share their hints for avoiding those holiday hassles : TAKE THE AGONY OUT OF THE INQUISITION Those " well-meaning " questions can make you feel as if you 're facing a family firing squad. To fend off their attacks : Realize it 's their opinion, but it 's your life. So what if you do n't fit their vision of how to live? Why should you? " The point is not to internalize that there is something wrong with you, " says Watson. Understand the motivation behind the message. Interrogators ' con- CONTINUED ON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance may be motivated by their own fears or even painful past experiences. " Some relatives want to point out what they think are your foibles, so they can feel better about themselves, " says Grant. Cut them off at the pass. " Put the onus back on the questioner, " says Grant. Keep it light. Laugh and say, " Well, this time I actually got in the door and took my coat off before you asked me who I 'm seeing, Aunt Helen. What took you so long? " If humor does n't work, you could always change the subject by saying " Let 's keep the peace and not go there. " Plan an escape. Have a signal with an ally( your husband or sister, for example) when you need to be " rescued " or when it 's time to go. You can get out of the situation by taking a walk together or clearing dishes. Discourage Dysfunctional Drama To deal with relatives who are acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse way to get it. Often the relative who behaves outrageously is crying out for love or understanding. Encourage him to share what 's in his heart, or simply offer a warm embrace. He 'll feel less needy and less compelled to start with the histrionics. Do n't overreact. Criticizing, making apologies for the person 's actions or otherwise calling extra attention to it may make a tense situation even more uncomfortable. What 's more, " an audience may only egg them on, " says Grant. Confront the culprit-alone. Consider sharing with your relative at a later time, and in private, how you feel when such situations erupt. Urge her to seek professional help if her actions are selfdestructive. If it 's a repeat performance, speaking to her ahead of your family gathering may head off further trouble. Avoid a Rift Over Gifts Sure, it 's the thought that counts, but " What the heck were you thinking? " is not what a giver wants to hear. To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a price tag on love. You should feel valued by your man every day, not just on December 25. If your lover does n't give you a gift or gives you something that obviously required very little thought, do n't be surprised, says Watson. If he was n't a giver before, he wo n't be one now. Also, she adds, " Do n't expect that giving him an expensive gift will elevate your value in his eyes. A gift will not make a relationship more than it already is. " Know what to expect. To prevent any disappointments, consider discussing presents up front and assigning a dollar value. Avoid waste and bad taste. Make an effort to know the tastes of the recipient.( See Intimacies on page 50 for more tips on holiday giving and receiving.) Spend within your budget. If your family is large and your budget small, consider drawing names out of a basket so that each member buys one gift.

" Consider seeking therapy about a month before you go home, " advises Grant. Stay in the here and now. " Do n't bring events from 15 years ago with you, " suggests Wade. To help maintain emotional control, remind everyone that these gatherings are for good times, not for airing grievances. Schedule a family conference. Ideally it should be before, or after, the festivities. Set ground rules. If the holiday visit is the only time those in conflict can meet and talk, set aside perhaps one hour per day to do so, advises Watson. Encourage listening without judgment. Let one person speak without interruption. The second person should repeat what he heard to make sure the speaker has been understood-but not to agree or disagree.

Share how you 'd like to relate to each other going forward and what you 'd like to see happen, regardless of what happened before. Put the past behind you. Consider a ritual to put closure on previous hurt. Each of you might write down resentments and burn them together in an ashtray or the fireplace. Handle Secrets With Care Holidays are often the time when revelations do the most damage. A secret is seeking a detonator to trigger a destructive family blowup. The experts advise : Ask yourself what the benefit of telling the secret is. " What is your motivation in revealing it? " says Grant. Be sensitive to others ' privacy, to their welfare and to timing. Refuse to be in charge of secrets. Watson warns, " If you are asked to keep a grave secret, be honest and tell the person that it is a burden for you. " Encourage her to confide in a minister, counselor or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be held hostage by the whim of others. " -S.L. <p>
