4139041 Section : Cosmology calibration How are exploding stars changing our view of the universe 's mysterious force? # You never know what a day brings. Or a night. That 's why Peter Nugent, an astrophysicist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, pushed himself August 24, 2011, to see what the Palomar Transient Factory( PTF) had turned up. Nugent 's software sifts through data collected by the PTF - an automated wide-field survey that utilizes a 1.2-meter telescope at Southern California 's Palomar Observatory - looking for changing objects in the night sky. # At the top of his priority list that day was a special kind of stellar explosion called a type la supernova. Such a finding is not unusual in itself - the PTF typically identifies about one new supernova each night. But the one Nugent found that day - a star that blew up in M101, a spiral galaxy 21 million light-years away - stood out from the pack. Dubbed SN 2011fe, it is, as Nugent puts it, " a once-in-a-generation event, " the closest and brightest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the advent of modern, digital instrumentation. # Dazzling bursts in the sky that can sometimes outshine their own galaxies, type la( pronounced " one A ") supernovae have fascinated and puzzled astronomers for centuries. But these objects recently have taken on far greater significance than mere curiosities : Observations of this class of supernovae led to the discovery that the universe 's expansion is speeding up, for which the 2011 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded. Scientists theorize that " dark energy " is causing that acceleration. This finding ranks among the most scientifically important in the past century, yet it was based on the study of astronomical objects that still elude even the most basic of questions. # Cosmologists think dark energy dominates the universe, constituting about 72 percent of the total energy density, yet no one knows what it is. Many astrophysicists hope that if they can improve their understanding of type la supernovae, perhaps they can make cosmological measurements more precise and thereby gain a better understanding of dark energy, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield a wealth of information about these tumultuous celestial events - information that could advance our picture of both stellar evolution and cosmology. Fortunately, he caught the supernova just 11 hours after the explosion - the earliest detection ever for such an event. He sent an alert to the PTF consortium, and researchers promptly obtained follow-up observations with the Liverpool Telescope in the Canary Islands and NASA 's Swift space telescope. Owing to this confluence of circumstances, SN 2011fe has become the best-studied type la supernova in history, providing an opportunity to solve some of the mysteries surrounding this violent and ultraluminous phenomenon. # It starts from a cinder # Over the centuries, astronomers sometimes referred to such brilliant outbursts as " guest stars " - objects that appeared without warning and for no discernible reason, lighting up the heavens briefly before fading from view. More recently, investigators have come to believe that a type la supernova is the fiery explosion of a white dwarf - the dense inert core, composed almost entirely of carbon and oxygen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its outer hydrogen shell and contracts under the influence of gravity to an Earth-sized volume. The mostly dead white dwarf emits just a tiny fraction of the Sun 's energy, although its luminosity changes spectacularly if and when it blows up ; it then becomes 10 billion times as bright as our star. # Scientists think a type la supernova starts with a white dwarf that accrues additional mass through either a dramatic merger with another white dwarf or through a gentler process of siphoning off gas from a nearby stellar companion( either a red giant or a normal star). If the white dwarf gains enough material to reach a critical mass - the so-called Chandrasekhar limit, which is some 1.4 times the Sun 's mass - it will undergo uncontrolled thermonuclear fusion, exploding with the energy of 100 trillion trillion hydrogen bombs while consuming almost all of its carbon and oxygen fuel in a matter of seconds. # Although the theory is by no means ironclad, many astrophysicists think type la supernovae all begin with a white dwarf of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit) and at the same stage of stellar evolution. Both of these characteristics suggest that the luminosity of such events should be relatively uniform - an estimated 1036 watts at peak luminosity. If that reasoning holds, scientists can use these explosions as " standard candles " and judge celestial distances by how bright or faint they appear. # In the case of SN 2011fe, astronomers also got an independent check on distance owing to the presence of Cepheid variables in M101 - a class of luminous variable stars with a well-established relationship between intrinsic brightness and the pulsation period. Consequently, says Nugent, " We now have the best measure of the intrinsic brightness of this kind of supernova yet obtained. " # Farther than they should be # For the purposes of cosmology, the brightness of a supernova reveals its distance and, by extension, the time when the light left on its journey toward Earth. But that 's just half the story. Cosmologists also need to know what happened to the light during the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( or " redshifted ") by the expansion of the universe. To get this information, astronomers look not only at the luminosity of a supernova and its remnants but also at the spectrum, or characteristic colors, of the light it emits. # Basically, a supernova gives off much of its light in a specific blue wavelength that corresponds to the explosion 's temperature. The wavelength of light that telescopes detect is physically tied to the universe 's size. If the universe has stayed the same size during the journey, the light wo n't change its wavelength. But if the universe has grown bigger in the interim, the wavelength will get bigger, too, and the peak color will shift toward the red end of the spectrum. The more the universe grows, the redder the light gets. The trick then is to find supernovae at different distances from us - say at 1 billion, 3 billion, and 5 billion light-years away - determine what has happened to their emitted light in that period, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Two teams carried out an analysis of this sort : Saul Perlmutter at the University of California, Berkeley, on one side and Adam Riess of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, and Brlan Schmidt of the Australian National University in Weston Creek on the other. While the teams expected to measure the deceleration of the universe 's expansion due to the gravity of cosmic mass, they were surprised to find that rather than slowing down, the universe 's expansion is actually accelerating. Some unseen, mysterious substance - dubbed " dark energy " because of its unknown nature - is opposing gravity and pushing the universe apart. That 's what f the trio of researchers discovered more than 10 years ago, and that 's what earned them the Nobel Prize. # Their work was momentous, concrete, and inspired, and their prizes are well-deserved. But uncertainties still surround the supernovae upon which scientists ' view of dark energy largely rests. In fact, the more astrophysicists look, and the better they understand these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cosmology 's so-called standard candles may have varying characteristics. " They do n't all look alike, " says UC Berkeley astrophysicist Daniel Kasen. " Recent observations have shown an interesting, and disturbing, range of diversity. The big question is how standard are these supernovae, and how well can we standardize them? " # Matters of adjustment # Astrophysicists have long known that various adjustments have to be made to calibrate these standard candles. In 1993, Mark Phillips( now based at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile) found a correlation between a type la supernova 's intrinsic brightness and the width of its " light curve " - a measurement of how fast the blast 's luminosity rises and falls over time. Phillips found that brighter supernovae have broader light curves, meaning that they take longer to reach their maximum brightness and longer to fade away. Researchers already take this relationship into account to make such supernovae useful cosmic yardsticks. # Color also must be factored in : The presence of dust can make type la supernovae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and UC Berkeley physicist Robert Tripp showed separately in the 1990s. To compensate for the phenomenon of dust reddening - similar to the red sunsets one sees on smoggy evenings - astronomers noticed that these supernovae all have about the same color a couple of months after reaching their peak brightnesses. If a particular supernova deviated from that and looked redder than usual, it was presumably due to dust, thus warranting an additional correction to the distance calculation. # Today, the astrophysics community recognizes that further refinements are needed. The brightness of the explosions, for example, may depend on the star 's environment, its composition( and ratio of heavy elements), and other factors. But just fine-tuning is n't enough. # Bigger problems # Until recently, astrophysicists have been embarrassingly ignorant about some of the most basic features of type la supernovae. " The nature of the type la explosion and the progenitors involved have remained elusive, even after seven decades of research, " explains Andrew Howell of the University of California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms : " The main thing we do n't know is : What is the system that is exploding, and why does it explode? " # Fortunately, there 's been considerable progress on the observational front, especially in the past year, with answers already obtained to some of those " elusive " questions. Nugent 's team, which found traces of high-speed carbon and oxygen in the spectrum of light fleeing SN 2011fe 's blast site, provided " the first direct evidence that a type la supernova does indeed start with a carbon-oxygen white dwarf, " he says. # A subsequent analysis led by UC Berkeley astronomer Joshua Bloom and published in January 2012 confirmed that the object that blew up was a carbon-oxygen white dwarf. That finding was based on a fortuitous observation of M101 taken by The Open University graduate student Stefan Holmes using the 17-inch PIRATE telescope on the island of Mallorca off Spain 's coast just four hours after the explosion. The supernova was not visible in the image, which places tight constraints on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that bigger progenitors create brighter glows from the supernova 's expanding shock wave. The non-detection by PIRATE - given the telescope 's size and Earth 's distance from M101 - indicates that the star must be small, less than 1/50 the Sun 's diameter. Thus, it could be only a white dwarf or a neutron star. " Since we see carbon and oxygen in the explosion, and a neutron star ca n't emit that, that leaves a white dwarf as the only possibility, " explains Nugent, a co-author of that study. # Nailing down the progenitor 's identity, at least in this one case, is helpful to theorists trying to model these explosions " because there are only so many ways you can blow up a carbon-oxygen white dwarf, " notes University of California, Santa Cruz, astrophysicist Stan Woosley. # Drawing on the PIRATE observations, Bloom and his colleagues also determined that SN 2011fe 's companion star must, with few caveats, be a diameter less than 1/10 that of the Sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. # Even stronger confirmation of the " double-degenerate theory, " which holds that a type la supernova is triggered by the merger of two white dwarfs, came in a January 2012 paper by Bradley Schaefer and Ashley Pagnotta of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. Schaefer and Pagnotta looked for a companion star to the remnant of a supernova( SNR 0509-67.5) that detonated in the Large Magellanic Cloud about 400 years ago. If the companion to the exploding white dwarf was another star, such as a main sequence star or a red giant - the so-called " single-degenerate " case - it should have survived the blast. No stars would remain after the cataclysmic union of two white dwarfs. Studying archival images of the remnant taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, Schaefer and Pagnotta found no signs of a companion star some 4 magnitudes fainter than nature would allow, thus ruling out all single-degenerate models and leaving a double-degenerate system as " the only remaining possibility. " # " This conclusion seems sound, " concurs University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief limitation, according to Schaefer, " is that we have this incredibly decisive result for just one supernova. If this one progenitor class dominates all type la supernovae, then we 've solved the whole problem. If there are two progenitor classes, then we 've only solved half the problem. " # A type la supernovae division? # A 2011 paper by Mark Sullivan of Oxford University in the United Kingdom and collaborators, which analyzed 472 type la supernovae, suggests that these events may subdivide into two categories, depending on whether the supernova occurs in a massive galaxy with a high rate of star formation or in a lower-mass galaxy with less star formation. The different mix of stars in those galaxies could lead to different white dwarf companions. " Even after you make the usual corrections for the light curve width and color, these supernovae still differ in brightness depending on the kind of galaxy they come from, " says Howell, a study co-author. # While some may lament the need to continually refine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing : " We might now be able to subclassify two supernovae that otherwise look the same - depending on the kind of host galaxy or the companion star - all of which can lead to increasing precision in cosmology. " Right now, distance measurements of type la supernovae are accurate to within about 6 percent ; new approaches can improve on that mark. # Ryan Foley of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has developed a method to make these supernovae even better standard candles. While astronomers have traditionally assumed that some explosions are redder than others simply due to the presence of dust, Foley has shown that some of the color variation may be intrinsic to the supernova itself. He measured the speed of the material ejected from more than 300 type la supernovae, both nearby and far away, and found that objects with faster " ejecta " were redder while those with slower ejecta were bluer. So the standard color adjustment apparently needs some adjustment itself. # Forecast the future # Every improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest data, based on Sullivan 's supernovae survey and other work, suggest that dark energy is the " cosmological constant " - an inherent property of space itself that remains invariant over time and does not get diluted as the universe expands. If this picture holds, our universe will expand into the indefinite future at an ever-increasing clip, with galaxies driven farther and farther apart. " But if we 've been making mistakes, " notes Foley, " if there 's a fundamental difference, say, between nearby and distant supernovae that we 've overlooked, that could be enough to make something that looks like a cosmological constant no longer constant. " # Additional supernovae observations, compiled by existing programs like the PTF and the upcoming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and the proposed Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope, will undoubtedly clarify the picture. At the same time, new supercomputer calculations, carried out by theorists like Woosley and Kasen, will help show the extent to which asymmetries in the explosion can affect the luminosity of type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being able to make measurements that can tell us the ultimate fate of the universe, " says Howell. " Even though it looks like the universe is filled with this vacuum energy, the so-called cosmological constant, we have to keep on it and make sure we get the right answer.

These graphs show the surprising 1998 find ; the green lines demonstrate the best-fit model of roughly 70 percent dark energy and 30 percent matter.( In the top chart, the y-axis plots apparent magnitude minus absolute magnitude. In the bottom, the y-axis shows the difference between the observed distance and that predicated in an empty universe.) Before this discovery, researchers expected to confirm that the cosmic mass could make the universe collapse( the blue lines show a theoretical cosmos without dark energy). # How astronomers use supernovae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light covers a 1 by 1 area. # At two units of distance, the light spreads out over four times the area, so it is 1/4 as bright at any given point. # At three units of distance, the light is 1/9 as bright. # As photons beam outward from a light source, they spread out over a greater and greater area. The total light the source produces( its intrinsic brightness) remains constant, but the amount of light an observer sees( the source 's apparent brightness) decreases with distance at a predictable rate. As a result, the difference between intrinsic and apparent brightness reveals the observer 's distance from the light source. # M101 # SN 2011fe # In 2011, a type la supernova called 2011fe blazed in the spiral galaxy M101. # Astronomers compare a supernova 's intrinsic brightness to its brightness as measured from Earth.

Thus, astronomers gauge the object 's distance by how bright it appears - fainter standard candles must be farther away. For decades, scientists considered type la supernovae such a tool, but recent findings suggest that there might be slight differences in how they form, and therefore not all of these blasts have consistent luminosities.
