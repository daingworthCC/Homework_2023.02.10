Photograph Charles and sons : above, in 1998 and below, in 1991 with Diana. // Three heads huddled close, pouring over the collection of compact discs. Flick. Flick. Flick... Then they stopped short This one. The song was " YMCA, " the seventies disco anthem performed by The Village People. As England 's Prince William and Prince Harry stamped their feet to the music, Camilla Parker Bowles, who had helped them choose the number, moved onto the dance floor with their father, the Prince of Wales. Other guests at the party noted how the boys looked on with approval, even while playfully mugging in mock embarrassment, as any teenager might do, at their father 's youthful exertions. There were smiles all around as some 340 friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles joined the gyrations. And the crowdpleasing seventies and eighties disco hits kept coming. It was the boys who were controlling the sound system. But like most every other aspect of this impeccable royal bash, the idea for the nostalgic tour of disco hits was actually Camilla 's. After all, it was the music she and Charles had danced to when thev were first lovers more than a quarter of a century ago. And it soon became obvious to William, 16, and Harry., 14, just what groups their father and his girlfriend liked-the Bee Gees, Abba, Roxy Music-and they happily supplied them. It also became clear that beneath the revelry, something serious was happening. As William and Harry danced and clowned beside Charles and Camilla, a mutual happiness seemed to envelop all four. A new closeness had set in that made them feel like they were a family. And although the boy.s ' mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, had been dead a mere 14 months, no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was as if the boys, young as they are, understood that, with their mother dead, the thing they want most of all is for their father to be happy, " says one of the guests. " And they like Camilla-that 's obvious. " Of course there will always be those who chafe at the idea of Diana 's boys being in the company of Charles 's longtime forbidden love. Even though Camilla was divorced in 1995, the staff members at Charles 's office still refer to her only as " Mrs. P.B. " And the Queen is said to be appalled at the thought of her son marrying this woman. But that night, a sea change was brewing. For her tribute to the man she loves, Camilla transformed a nondescript hospitality suite at Highgrove, Charles 's Gloucestershire country house, into an exquisite indoor garden. Twelve massive tables were decorated with wildflowers, foliage. twigs, and leaves from the estate. Statues of Greek heroes from his beloved garden had been re-created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a cluster of sawn-off tree stumps that he likes to sit on. Charles was unabashedly delighted. But in the end, it was the young princes ' reaction that turned a good party into a triumph. For the first time in such public circumstances, William and Harry had seen the reality of their father 's love affair-and they apparently accepted it without blinking. JUST TEN WEEKS EARLIER, THE BOYS HAD marked the first anniversary of their mother 's death. They spent it with the Queen, Prince Philip, and their father at Balmoral, the Royal castle in Scotland, which is where they had been staying when Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris. For the anniversary, a private memorial service was held in the local parish church, attended only by the Royal Family and British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie. The public was not admitted. At the same time the Queen instructed flags to fly at half-mast on all public buildings in Britain. This was Charles 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother resisted-as she had a year earlier -- he would take her grandsons to Earl Spencer 's memorial service for his sister at Althorp, Diana 's family estate where she is buried. Charles 's defiant honoring of Diana 's memory has had a profound impact on the British people. They see him becoming, in many ways, the man she always wished he would be. And though they once reviled him for the way he treated their darling Princess, his future subjects now understand that he, perhaps more than anyone. is also a victim of the cold and seemingly insensitive Windsor family. Friends now say that if it had n't been for Diana 's tragic death and Charles 's response, the world might never have seen the man inside who was bursting to escape. In private, there is almost a painful tenderness in Charles 's efforts to be both mother and father to his sons. Ironically, when they were infants, Diana had to coax him into the nursery. " He 's uncomfortable with small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because his sons are teenagers with growing independence that he is able to adjust. " Even so, adds the friend, " If Diana were still alive, he might never have gotten this close to them because, in his mind, it would have meant being in competition with her. " Whatever their past battles and jealousies, Charles now " will never say a word against Diana, " says another friend. " He knows it would upset both William and Harry. He would never take that risk. " The many framed photos of Diana that Charles has kept on his desk and throughout Highgrove since their divorce in 136 are all still in place. And Camilla, who lives in her own home 17 miles away, apparently accepts the display without question. Most surprising is Charles 's newfound willingness to display affection. Observers note that he has become openly loving with his children. The boys cuddle with their dad in the same way they used to with Diana-especially Harry, who sometimes covers his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop. Harry loves to tease his father, especially about his being 50. And, now that he is away at school( at Eton with his big brother), his warm and frequent letters to his father are illustrated with drawings and sprinkled with humor. Recently, after Prince Charles became an honorary rear admiral in the Royal Navy, Harry addressed a letter to him, " Rear Admiral Papa. " At this point, Harry is less academically gifted than his older brother, and far less sure of himself. But he has inherited his father 's artistic interests, and he sketches and paints with natural skill. William is more stoic. Despite his resemblance to his troubled mother, he is, as she noted, " a Windsor at heart " Cool and steady, he has the Royal Family 's instinctive ability to hide his feelings in public-and to quietly get what he wants. The six-foot-two-inch teenager is showing normal signs of increasing independence. He arrived at his father 's Highgrove party wearing army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the school 's cadet force and had come straight home from exercises. " He was rather proud of the fact that he spent the last night in a ditch, " recalls one guest.( The young prince promptly changed into black tie.)

They are greeted by Charles with a fatherly acceptance. Meanwhile, at home with Charles and Harry, William often invokes his late mother 's teachings. A family friend says, " There have been occasions when William has refused to do something his father wanted and justified it by quoting Diana : Only do what your heart tells you. ' It 's so ironic, because Charles believes that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bv her heart and not her head. " " He worries about the boys constantly, " says a senior courtier. " He really does want them to have those teenage years to themselves. Everyone thinks there was a tug-of-war between him and Diana, she wanting them to experience the real world and he to draw them into the palace system, but he has always wanted them both to grow up as men of the world. He is passionate about this because he does n't want them to have the doubts about themselves that have always been with him. " The Queen was notoriously aloof from her children. And Prince Philip is said to have been something of a bully toward his eldest son. " Why ca n't you be more like your sister Anne? " he often shouted at Charles. Astonishingly, his parents gave him no gift for his fiftieth birthday, an oversight that Charles has mentioned to his friends. The Queen hosted a reception for him at Buckingham Palace. so the birthday was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this. He has much more to say about Camilla 's unsuccessful search for a gift, to which he refers with fond chuckles.( Contrary to some reports, she did not give him an antique garden bench.) Camilla tried twice to buy ' him the present he said he really wanted. The first time, she set out to buy a shed for his free-range chickens. No ordinary shed-a dazzling geometric working of wrought iron, polished wood, and glass that cost $20,000. But she soon learned that someone else had already gotten it for him. Next, she shopped for a statue of an eagle for his garden. But she had been beaten to that too. When, the day before his birthday. Camilla told Charles how unlucky she had been finding him a present, thev fell into each other 's arms, laughing. Photograph Above, in 1996. At right, in the early days of courtship, the young lovers on a theater date in 1975. // The gift the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course, was the approval of the British people. In a simple, almost childish way, that is what he has craved all his life, and even on good days, he has constantly sought reassurance bv asking friends how he is regarded. This constant self-absorption, together with his propensity to complain, has strained his closest friendships. Even Camilla has been known to despair at his lack of self-confidence. " She does get a bit fed up with his constant moaning, " says one of her friends, " but she loves him, so she puts up with it. " Although she is a mere 16 months his senior, Camilla is, as one of his closest friends describes her, " the mother he never had, caring and supporting and encouraging him, not wanting the limelight like Diana, which to him is important. " Camilla 's friends say she worries that she is not " serious-minded " enough for him, that her grasp of economics, ecology, and literature is limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman who gives him love and lovalty. " He is a man plagued with insecurities, " one of her friends says. " She wants to make him calm and happy. " Camilla 's emerging role as a bridge between Charles and his sons may change how she is perceived by the public. The boys obviously like her earthy humor, her easy, down-to-earth attitudes. They like the fact that she is no disciplinarian, and that she has a messy streak like them. " The boys understand their father 's need for her company, " says one of Charles 's oldest friends. " He 's a sensitive, melancholy, tortured soul, and she can deal with him. " Early in 1997, when Charles first brought up the difficult matter of Camilla with William, the boy reportedly looked straight at his father and said, " th tenderness, " Whatever makes you happy, Papa. " Contrary to gossip, Camilla 's friends say she would like to marry the Prince. Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are-Camilla always on the end of a telephone if he needs to talk, and with him day or night when he needs her at his side. On the other hands friends concede that if her need for marriage was " very great, " then Charles would find it, as one puts it, " hard to resist. " Crucial to this decision will certainly be what William and Harry want. Charles has made it evident that he will always put them before Camilla. And he would no doubt seek their permission before marrying her. Judging from that night at Highgrove. with music thumping and champagne flowing until the wee hours. their answer would probably be " whatever makes you happy. Papa. " As those three heads came together again over the CD collection, it was clear to even-one-even Charles-that Camilla makes them happy too. * Author Affiliation Richard Kay is the Royal Corresponcent for the London Daily Mail, a position he has held since 1986.
