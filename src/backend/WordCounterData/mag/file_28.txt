2003841 Fishing folks have lots of sayings, some better known than others. Among them : " It 's called fishing, not catching " and " Desperate times demand desperate measures. " Then there 's, " Break out the surefire fish caller! " This last one is the new favorite of anglers from Troop 749 of The Dalles, Ore. It gets used in emergencies, such as slow times when frustrated fishermen need something, anything, to change their luck. Starting the Process Such a frustratingly slow time occurred last October. Sitting in a 26-foot boat on the Columbia River, the four Scouts waited on walleye. And they waited. And they waited. First Class Scout Derek Campbell sighed. " Well, " the 13-year-old said, working his rod, " it 's called fishing, ya know, not catching. " The process had started. Soon someone would mention what a desperate situation the fishless fishermen were in. Then, a little later, an emergency would be declared and out would come the surefire fish callers. Early Warnings But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had paid off earlier in the day. When the Scouts first boarded the twin-engine boat owned by fishing guide Pat Kelley, they heard good and bad news. Photograph T-i-ick, t-o-ock : Matthew Walton waits and waits and( sigh waits for a bite. Photograph Patience. Nathan and Matthew Walton and other Scout anglers needed lots of it to hook this steelhead( top and walleye. // Mr. Kelley, who has fished the Columbia 200 days a year for the past 15 years, said, " Walleye were n't biting yesterday. " The good news? " We 're going to start out after steelhead this morning, then try to find walleye this afternoon. " While the Columbia River is famous for holding a variety of fish species, from four-pound smallmouth bass to 400-pound sturgeon, steelhead ranks high on any angler 's wish list. These rainbow trout swim to sea, where they grow into giants, then return to rivers to spawn. " Catching 10-pounders and up is common, " Mr. Kelley said. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, 13. " The biggest fish I ever caught was a seven-inch trout. " " It weighed about a pound, " Zachary Walton, Nathan 's twin, said. " You 'll easily beat that. " Wetting Lines The boat ran up to the John Day River, a tributary feeding into the Columbia. There, several dozen boats slowly trolled deepdiving plugs for steelhead. Mr. Kelley shut down his boat 's big engines and fired up a 1 horsepower outboard motor to move the boat at the right trolling speed. Assistant Scoutmaster Doug Walton, the Walton brothers ' dad, helped rig graphite rods for the Scouts. " Derek and Zachary will fish off the stern, " Mr. Kelley said. " Let out 60 pulls of line. A pull is about a foot. Nathan and Matthew will fish amidships, letting out 40 pulls. " Rod tips throbbed as the plugs vibrated and dipped behind the slow-moving boat. Derek scanned the other boats nearby and saw one dragging a five-gallon bucket. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said with a laugh. Bucketfish? As he was told that some anglers use a bucket to slow their boat to the proper trolling speed, Matthew Walton jumped as if a bomb had ex ploded under him. Photograph Heading for another fishing hole, adults teach Scouts how to operate their boat // " Fish on! Fish on! " he hollered. The other three lines got reeled in quickly to avoid tangling. Matthew also reeled fast, though carefully. Suddenly, his face went slack, just as his line did. The fish had thrown the lure. " There 'll be another fish, " Mr. Kelley said. And almost as soon as the lines were back out, Nathan took a turn at hollering. " I 've got a fish ; I 've got a fish! " Nathan struggled with his bowed rod as a silvery rocket erupted behind the boat. The boys cheered him on as the steelhead surged in the still water, then turned and swam toward the boat. " Reel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready. " Edge him a little closer.... " And he netted the supersize trout. A Personal Record As brother Zachary had predicted, Nathan beat his record. A 12-pound steelhead was now his biggest fish. After lunch, Derek Campbell suggested : " Let 's catch another steelhead before we go for walleye. " So the Scouts trolled another 45 minutes. They watched fish get hooked, but by other boats. It was time for walleye. On the five-mile run upriver, Mr. Walton, recently retired from the U.S. Coast Guard, explained navigation as Mr. Kelley gave each Scout a lesson in boat handling. Photograph How big? " Matthew Walton, right, listens to brother Zachary tell a big-fish, urn, tale. Photograph Laws say how many and what size fish anglers can keep.

Derek Campbell, Nathan Walton, Zachary Walton and Matthew Walton( left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for walleye. // At the fishing area, the boys were told to slowly bounce their bait a few inches off the bottom, where walleye feed. Matthew jigged just right, raising his rod tip a few inches, then lowering it, raising, lowering-boom! The rod bent. " I got one, " he squealed, reeling a 12-inch yellow perch to the surface. " Where there 's perch there should be walleye, " Mr. Kelley offered. " They like perch for dinner too. " Here Walleye, Walleye, Walleye ' Unfortunately, there were no walleye. The Scouts sat and waited and waited. Soon Derek made the fishing-notcatching remark. Desperation set in. " Break out the surefire fish caller! " Derek said. He opened a soft drink, pulled loose its tab, and pressed it to his lips. " Here walleye, walleye, walleye, walleye! " he called. What happened soon afterward is the kind of thing you had to see to believe. Matthew hollered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scouts cheered as the net swept into the green water and pulled back a two-pound walleye. The boys ' luck had turned. And as Derek put away his surefire fish caller, everyone understood yet another angler 's saying : " Never be afraid to try something new.
