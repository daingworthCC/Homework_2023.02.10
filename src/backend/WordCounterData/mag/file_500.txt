4105441 MAC Senior Artist Fatima Thomas helps Beauty Director Corynne L. Corbett adapt three runway looks for the real world <p> We all know there 's a whole lot of theatrics involved in putting on a fashion show. Although I marvel at the makeup artistry, I am often left wondering. Who is going to wear that? When I posed the question to MAC 's artistic team, who created 201 makeup styles for shows in New York, London, Paris and Milan, Senior Artist Fatima Thomas knew exactly what I meant. Here 's her advice on what to keep, what to dial down and what 's better left on the runway, <p> GRAPHIC EYE AT SOPHIE THEALLET <p> CATWALK : " It 's reminiscent of the 1960s. " Thomas muses. " What makes it more modern is the graphic crease : White pencil was used on the inner rims, and the liner on the lower lid is broken for a striking effect, " The liner is intriguing, but could I get away with it? <p> SIDEWALK : " You have to be carefui about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' You missed a spot, ' " explains Thomas, who used a black pencil to line the entire eye, then winged it up and worked it across my socket for depth. " It 's still graphic because the color is strong and dark. " <p> BOLD, BRIGHT EYES AT ZAC POSEN <p> CATWALK : Inspired by Art Nouveau glass and the shimmering backs of beetles, these vivid colors are boosted by a finely textured glitter named MAC Reflex Gold and a creamy black pencil named Smolder. It 's a little Showgirls, but I love it. <p> SIDEWALK : Thomas nixed the glitter but used Smolder as my eye base, which intensifies shades applied on top of it. She then layered on Club, Expensive Pink and Electric Eel, " Glitter looks better when it 's used decisively instead of all over, " she points out. For nighttime glam, add it to the corner of eyes or the center of the Hd. <p> NUDE AT JONATHAN SAUNDERS <p> CATWALK : To create this, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for barely-there lips, glowing skin and mascara-free eyes. Frankly, I 'd probably look really tired if I tried this. <p> SIDEWALK : " Getting a nude effect right on darker skin requires correct color intensities- especially on lips. " says Thomas. First she mixed Photo and Peachstock to make a caramel lip. Then she used Golden Bronze Iridescent Powder on cheeks and the center of my nose, stopping before the tip. She finished with false lashes to make my eyes stand out more. Sidebar <p> Fatima preps me for the nude trend.
