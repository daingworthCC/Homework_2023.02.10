4144041 FEEDBACK : **26;1685;TOOLONG # When you 're at the starting line, the odds of becoming a millionaire seem like, well, a million to one. Fortunately, they 're a considerably better 12 to one. Want to improve your chances of making it to the seven-figure circle even more? The next 12 pages will teach you the one key move you must make to get to $1 million no matter which road to wealth you 've chosen, from investing in real estate or stocks, to climbing the corporate ladder, running your own business, or power saving now that the kids have left. Get ready to hit the accelerator. # TRACK NO. 5 REAL ESTATE # KEY MOVE : EXPAND YOUR HOLDINGS TO AT LEAST THREE RENTAL PROPERTIES. # WHY IT WORKS : Becoming a landlord has always been a well-worn path to millionaire status, with good reason : Not only does owning properties let you generate a second source of income, your tenants ' checks will help you build equity in your investment. The case for owning rental real estate is even more compelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the fact that the shortage of rental housing is the most acute it 's been in five years, according to CoreLogic. # Yet with median prices on existing homes at around $182,600, you wo n't get rich by owning one home. Based on modest estimates for appreciation and reasonable expectations for profits, it 's likely to take three or more properties to produce the cumulative equity and rental earnings you need to get to the nominal sum of $1 million down the road.( Throughout this story, references to $1 million are to the nominal--not **26;1713;TOOLONG) # HOW TO GET THERE # Maximize your market. Once you own a property or two in an area, adding a third nearby generally makes sense, says Chris Clothier, co-owner of Memphis Invest, which buys and manages rental homes for investors. " It 's usually easier to manage, " he says. You can also save on maintenance by using a single contractor. # If fielding late-night calls about water leaks does n't grab you, grouping your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage your properties( typically for about 8% to 10% of the rent plus commissions). # Of course, you 'll want greater diversification if you 're buying in a smaller town dominated by a single large employer. # Think duplex or triplex. That extra unit probably wo n't cost you much more, yet the extra rent can be significant. Three years ago real estate agent Greg Markov bought a triplex in Phoenix for $70,000, or about $5,000 more than what he would have paid for a single-family home in the same neighborhood. With more units, Markov 's maintenance costs are higher--he budgets $2,000 a year, vs. $1,000 for a one-family home. Yet the three units throw off $1,500 a month in rent, not $900. # Also, Fannie Mae rules state that you can finance up to four properties--which includes your primary residence--with just 20% down. Homes five through 10 will require at least 25% down and a higher credit score( 720 vs. 620). Fannie, however, counts a duplex, triplex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can finance more units at beneficial terms. # Finance creatively. Take what the market is giving you. Buying with cash, for instance, will get you the best prices. So if you have, say, $150,000 saved up, try purchasing house No. 1 with savings. Then within six months, take out a Fannie Maebacked loan on 80%--in that time frame Fannie will consider it a purchase loan, with better terms than a cash-out refinance. You can use that $120,000 to buy house No. 2. # Own your own company? The U.S. Small Business Administration offers 10% down low-cost real estate loans as long as the business occupies at least 51% of the space. # In 2010, Greg and Audrey Charlap of Hermosa Beach, Calif., obtained SBA financing for a $755,000 store/warehouse with three apartments upstairs. The rent checks cut the real estate tab for their business, baby-products retailer Pampered Tot, by 35%, Greg says. # " BUILDING " WEALTH # Here 's how you can be on the path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # The following text appears within a chart.

A few upgrades, such as granite countertops, will make your rental stand out and reduce vacancies. # HOW TO VET TENANTS # For $10 to $30, services such as **26;1741;TOOLONG will run credit and criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KEY MOVE : BOOST YOUR ANNUAL RETURNS BY A PERCENTAGE POINT. # WHY IT WORKS # The difference between getting to $1 million and falling short can come down to a margin as thin as this--or slimmer. That 's even if you have fewer than 20 years to hit your target, and even if equities never fully return to their former glory( see the chart on the opposite page). # HOW TO GET THERE # Tone your core. The traditional way to boost gains is to tilt toward stocks. To ratchet up your returns by a point a year, though, you may have to be willing to shift from, say, a modest 60% stock/40% bond strategy to a far-riskier 80% equity/20% fixed-income mix. Ugh. # There 's a safer way. Cut the fat from your core portfolio--without changing your overall equity exposure--simply by replacing your existing investments with low-cost exchange-traded funds. " Now may be a particularly good time to do this, " says Bill Allen, vice president of portfolio consulting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds for five to 10 years, they probably have n't produced many taxable gains. So switching may not trigger much of a tax bill( obviously, this is n't a concern in tax-sheltered accounts). Also, if you sold any funds that sunk in 2008, you may be sitting on realized losses that you can use to offset gains caused by swapping. # You can assemble a diversified portfolio of ETFs for just 0.4% a year--0.6 points cheaper than a typical portfolio of managed funds. You can do even better with cheaper-than-average choices( see the box below). This simple move, then, can get you more than halfway to your goal. # Earn more by doing less. Reacting impulsively to big swings in stock prices can open up potholes on the road to $1 million. In the 2000s, investors earned 1.4 points less a year than the average U.S. equity fund owing to mistiming the market. # Close this gap by a third--just by being more patient--while cutting costs and you 'll reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desired level. Then only touch your holdings once a year, on a predetermined date, to rebalance your mix back to your desired weightings. That 's what helped Brent Boynton, 60, and his wife, Roxanne, 54, of Sun Prairie, Wis., recover from the 2008 crash. Like most investors, the couple did n't see the sell-off coming until it was too late. " However, " says Brent, " we rebalanced our portfolio in early 2009 and have more than made up for our 2008 losses. " # Take a " smart " flier on a potential highflier as a bonus. Regret not betting on Apple when it was a $6 stock in 1990? There 's nothing wrong with taking a flier, if the wager is small enough not to miss and if you set some smart ground rules. # Start small.

Go with industries where demand will keep growing no matter what, says James Stack of InvesTech Research--like energy, which stands to benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake, though, focus on shares that have been pummeled lately. Small-cap oil and gas stocks, for instance, are down 32% since last spring. # GETTING INTO GEAR GO FOR INSTANT DIVERSIFICATION # If you have little saved, choose funds that give you the broadest exposure. Own the whole U.S. market through Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF( VTI) and Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF( BND). # TAKE THE MATCH # If your 401(k) offers you a 50-on-the-dollar match up to 6%--as many plans do--that 's a 50% risk-free return.

" We tend to follow the advice of Vanguard founder John Bogle, as well as other " Bogleheads " : Purchase funds that have low fees, including index funds. " Tim adds : " We could easily use index funds exclusively but wanted some higher exposure to certain sectors, including health care and real estate. " Even with a few managed funds, the Moyers pay an average of just 0.23% in annual expenses per year in their portfolio--or about a quarter what the typical fund portfolio bills in fees per year. This, plus the couple 's dilligent savings, explains why the Moyers are already halfway to their goal line. # TRACK NO. 3 CLIMBING THE LADDER # KEY MOVE : SECURE JUST ONE MORE BIG PROMOTION THAT GIVES YOU REAL AUTHORITY. # WHY IT WORKS # The path to becoming a millionaire shortens with every major step you take up the corporate hierarchy. Jump from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you become eligible for greater supplemental income like bonuses and stock options. # Take another big leap up to HR director, and your overall compensation really swells--by more than 40%. The good news : You do n't have to make it all the way to the C-suite to see real benefits( see the chart). # HOW TO GET THERE # Start by managing others ' careers, not just your own. In virtually every job, workers who have people reporting to them earn more than individual contributors. Over the course of a 40-year career, the median lifetime pay for those who supervise one or more workers amounts to nearly $1 million more than for nonmanagers. Even people with the same title will earn more if they 're in charge of others. A software developer with three direct reports earns a median salary of $74,000, vs. $66,000 for developers who oversee no one, notes Katie Bardaro of salary research site PayScale.com. Do n't be a company man or woman. Even if you 're earning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can still lead to salary stagnation, says Bonnie Sharps, executive vice president at executive search firm DHR. Pay hikes tied to promotions range from 5% to 7%. External hires, however, earn nearly 20% more than workers advanced from within, according to Wharton professor Matthew Bidwell. # Go to far lengths to get that promotion and the reward can be even bigger. Just ask Matt Payne. After grad school, Payne worked for an energy company in California. But with the high cost of living there and $25,000 in student loans, he was having a hard time making ends meet, let alone getting ahead. Then he heard about a more lucrative position at an oil firm. The catch : The job was in Qatar. " I knew the higher salary that came with a job abroad would allow me to pay off my loans faster and give me a leg up on savings. " He got the job and doubled his pay. # Recruit powerful mentors. How do you start reaching for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer you valuable career advice and recommend you for openings in their sphere of influence. " The most successful people I know have had multiple mentors and coaches throughout their career, " says Ford Myers, a career coach and the author of Get the Job You Want, Even When No One Is Hiring. # Dainon Haggard, a 31-year-old vice president of sales and business development for an entertainment promotions company in Salt Lake City, has taken this to heart. Shortly after being hired at his firm, he reached out to an executive VP and asked her to mentor him. " I told her that I admire her success and felt I could learn a lot from her, " says Haggard. " When I asked if I could bounce ideas off of her, she was more than happy to talk with me. " Now, he periodically invites her to join him on his sales calls so she can critique him. Haggard has n't stopped there. He networks at industry events and now counts a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # GETTING INTO GEAR # DO N'T WAIT FOR YOUR COMPANY TO TRAIN YOU. Take classes on your own, attend industry seminars, and earn certifications that are in demand in your field to expand your skill set and stand out. # BE AN EXPERT, NOT AN EMPLOYEE. Write papers, give speeches, get involved in leadership positions with professional organizations and associations within your field. It 'll raise your profile and expand your network. # KNOW YOUR GOING RATE. When it 's time to negotiate salaries and raises, use compensation sites like PayScale, GlassDoor.com, and Vault.com to figure out what pay range is appropriate for what you do.

" In today 's title-heavy world, your last promotion might not translate easily when you are competing for a new role, " he says. " But your experiences will. " # Case in point : When Vavrasek was getting started, he served as an HR manager for a sales group at a consumer-products company, but he did n't have any direct sales experience himself. So he asked to work in a sales position to understand better how these employees worked and then went on to manage a small team there. # This proved to be a deft move : He landed his next job when a recruiter contacted him for a higher-level HR position at another company that wanted someone with sales experience, not just an HR background.

Most entrepreneurs take just enough out of profits to provide a livable income, plowing the rest back into the enterprise to keep it growing. Instead, the big payoff comes if and when you sell : A sampler of median sales prices from the online marketplace BizBuySell shows that the typical restaurant went for about $125,000 last year, pet-care shops sold for $215,000, communications firms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1.3 million. A few smart moves early on can help push your eventual selling price into seven figures too. # HOW TO GET THERE # Make it easy to pass the reins. Your venture will have greater intrinsic value if its success does not hinge on one person. " If a business is all about me as an individual, no one will want to buy it, " says Michael Eckton, managing partner of Crestwood Advisors, a Boston wealth-management firm that counsels many entrepreneurs. # For starters, do n't name the company after yourself. And do n't handle every aspect of the business by yourself. Last year former advertising copywriter Ross Gordon, 29, launched CraftJack, a website to help home-improvement contractors generate leads. One of his best moves, he says, was bringing in a top designer and programmer to help him develop a proprietary tool to help contractors manage those leads. The result : In June he sold the site to a bigger company in the same field for what he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big part of the sale was getting our team. " # Create a map for success. As you arrive at business systems that work well, write them down so that you can hand a how-to manual to your successor. " You want it to be so idiot-proof that you could pull out your employees, replace them with someone else, and the process would still get done the right way, " advises John Warrillow, author of Built to Sell. Diversify revenue streams. Buyers tend to pay more for a business that generates sales from subscriptions and service contracts than for one in which each dollar comes from selling something new. Also off-putting : if revenues are heavily dependent on one or two key customers. " Instead of selling lots of stuff to a few people, you 're better off selling one thing to a lot of people, " Warrillow says. Spruce up your digital presence. Your website is the first place buyers look, so avoid common pitfalls, like a dated design or unclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a high price was how well the site functioned. Before selling, also eliminate unnecessary expenses from your books that may detract value--say, having your son, who worked for you in the summer, listed on the payroll. Says Roger Murphy, CEO of Murphy Business &amp; Financial, a business brokerage : " Make sure your financial statements reflect what the new person will really make. " GETTING INTO GEAR GET LEGAL ADVICE. # A lawyer specializing in small business will help you structure the company. Whether you establish an S, C, or professional corporation can affect how much you pay in taxes and who can buy your business. # LINE UP A BANKER TOO. # Know whom you 'll turn to if you need a business loan. Do n't default to your personal bank. Instead, get referrals from others in the biz to bankers familiar with your industry and type of company. # BEEF UP CASH RESERVES. # Have enough to cover a year 's living expenses. If the venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be forced into a move you 'll regret to raise cash to tide you over, says wealth manager Evan Roth. # BUILDING IN EXTRA VALUE # Taking steps to boost your company 's appeal to future buyers can increase its eventual sale price by up to a third, depending on the type of business( see the estimated impact on a retail outfit below). # XYZ Retail Company Value # STEVEN BERRY, 43 # New Meadows, Idaho # OCCUPATION # President of Battery Universe, which provides batteries for cellphones, laptops, and other tech equipment # NET WORTH # $500,000 # WORDS OF WISDOM # " A BIGGER, MORE DIVERSE CUSTOMER BASE GIVES STABILITY TO THE BUSINESS.

At this rate, he expects to hit $1 million in net worth in 10 years or less. # TRACK NO. 5 POWER SAVING # KEY MOVE : AIM TO SAVE AT LEAST 15% OF YOUR INCOME FOR A PERIOD OF 10 YEARS OR MORE. # WHY IT WORKS # Research shows that people who practice so-called burst saving are far more likely to sock away enough money for a comfortable retirement than those who do n't. According to a study by the research firm Hearts &amp; Wallets, 64% of burst savers were able to build a nest egg equal to at least 10 times their annual pay, a common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likelier than nonpower savers to hit that goal no matter what age they started their savings regimen. Says Laura Varas, a principal at Hearts &amp; Wallets : " Once you 've got a base of assets that really matters, it puts a tail wind at your back. " # HOW TO GET THERE # Get the timing right. Burst savers most commonly funded a ramp-up in their savings rate with money they received from pay hikes and bonuses, according to the Hearts &amp; Wallets study. That way you do n't feel the pain of living on less ; you still take home more money, just not quite as much. Power savers also often timed bursts to periods when their expenses fell or their income spiked. For example, many substantially increased contributions to their 401(k) or other retirement accounts after their children left home or during periods when both spouses were working. Rein in your biggest budget busters. While small expenses do add up, it 's not really buying daily lattes or the latest tech toy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. It 's the really big bills, the five- and six-figure expenses like your home, car, and your kids ' college education that ultimately do you in, says Leah Ingram, founder of the blog SuddenlyFrugal.com. " Getting serious about super saving may mean making some hard choices, " Ingram says. # Case in point : computer programmer Scott Moore, 54, who 's managed to build a net worth of $735,000 on an annual salary of $83,000. Moore says the secret to his success has been keeping his housing and transportation bills low. He bought a four-bedroom fixer-upper in an estate sale for $63,000 in 1995 and did most of the repair work himself. He 's since paid off the mortgage and estimates the 2,700-square-foot house in St. Louis is now worth about $250,000. He owns a 15-year-old Buick Riviera with 154,000 miles on it and saves on gas and maintenance by mostly taking a train or bus to work and driving only when absolutely necessary. The payoff : Moore expects to hit millionaire status--$1.2 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years. # Create multiple streams of income. Your salary can stretch only so far and you can cut expenses only so much. Another way to supersize your savings is to supplement your main income with side work, says Christine Fahlund, senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price. Deploy existing skills or focus on something you are passionate about, like fundraising, event planning, or launching a sideline catering or craft business. " Turn your free time into cash doing something you enjoy and it wo n't seem like extra work, " says Fahlund. # A bonus to this strategy : " The experience and skills you build up from consulting or project work now is an excellent way to transition to a flexible retirement career, " Fahlund says. That way, you not only stay engaged as you age, but also get to keep adding to savings. # VICTOR KO, 35 # Philadelphia # OCCUPATION # Hospital physician # NET WORTH # $500,000 # WORDS OF WISDOM # " LIVING BELOW OUR MEANS HELPS US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAVINGS # Victor Ko is n't as wealthy as Warren Buffett( yet), but he shares one trait in common with the billionaire investor : He 's content to live in a much smaller home than he can afford.
