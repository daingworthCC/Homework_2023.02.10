2043141 We 've lost two family haulers but gained one that really hauls. PHOTOGRAPH BY TOM FOWLKS First Report Split personality : The Mazda CX-7 is a practical wagon that has a very sporty side. MAZDA CX-7 GRAND TOURING AWD There are plenty of sport utility vehicles on the road that offer utility, but precious few that deliver actual sport. And many of the ones that do are just plain expensive -- well outside the reality of most car buyers. Mazda has figured out how to build one for the rest of us. And it just took up residence in PM 's long-term test fleet, replacing the Kia Sedona and Hyundai Azera. Our all-wheel-drive CX-7 came with Grand Touring trim, including leather seats, sleek Piano Black accents and xenon headlamps. It looks sharp. We also specified the Technology package, mostly for the navigation system and backup camera. The CX-7 so far is a lot like a bargain BMW. It 's blessed with beautifully weighted, communicative steering and a chassis that welcomes back-road hustling. The 244-hp turbocharged Four is gutsy. But will it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2008 CX-7s can now operate with regular fuel or premium fuel thanks to a software change. However, we 're told that peak horsepower is only achievable with premium. We 'll have to see if the performance difference is noticeable when we switch from one fuel grade to another. Photograph : Enjoying the view : The CX-7 's dash layout is sleek and hip. We love the small -- diameter steering wheel and the nav system. As enjoyable as it is to hustle along country roads, the CX-7 can get tight when hauling lots of people and their stuff. The sleek roofline and aggressive tumblehome that make for such great styling limit the room behind the rear seats. We 've learned to pack efficiently. -- ben stewart Second Report DRIVERS NOTEBOOK : : We destroyed the right-front tire by puncturing it on a piece of scrap metal. : : An apparently related problem : the tire-pressure monitoring system persists in telling us one tire is low -- but our pressure gauge says it 's not.

It 's a looker. And passengers always remark about the spiffy interior. We like the ample power and reasonable fuel economy too, although it does have a minimum preference for midgrade fuel. But it 's difficult to be smooth around town with the Infiniti. The engine 's throttle tip-in off idle is pretty abrupt. It 's not a problem on the open road, but in stop-and-go driving with just a touch of throttle, we 're spilling our morning Starbucks. Trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting-in-front and merciless honking. Sheesh. So, we called Infiniti, which resulted in a senior powertrain engineer coming by to demonstrate a 2008-spec G35. The company had identified the same issue, and revised the engine-tuning parameters appropriately. It 's a big im-provement. We still enjoy driving our G -- but we 're mostly keeping it for road trips and nonurban driving. It 's been great on longer treks, especially when we make use of the excellent navigation system and killer stereo. -- mike allen Third Report DRIVERS NOTEBOOK : : Another overdrive gear in the transmission would make longer trips quieter. : : Everyone that sees this car assumes it 's a hybrid.

A Check Engine light? Nope. A blown windshield-wiper fuse? Not yet.Okay, how about a flat tire? Uh, no. This Fit appeared to be as reliable as the best kitchen appliance. But then, just as it rolled over the 10,000-mile mark, a notice came in the mail suggesting a timing adjustment to the control unit that governs the driver 's airbag, to make it deploy quicker. One small chink in this Honda 's armor, which took our local dealer about 10 minutes to fix. It 's been over 2800 miles since and the Honda is back to being bulletproof. All this reliability might actually start to get a little boring if the Fit was n't such a hoot to drive. Its firm suspension and quick steering make even routine trips to the grocery store feel like an autocross. Road trips, on the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if driven with a soft right foot, the Fit delivers great freeway mileage. But the stiff seats and constant 3000 rpm soundtrack can get old on a 400-mile trip. It made us yearn for a plush-riding sedan -- one with a six-speed transmission. We 're still amazed by the sheer volume of stuff that can be accommodated with all the Honda 's seats folded. It 's like a hip micro-minivan. -- b.s.

There 's an undeniable charm to the car 's appearance. But -- aye, there 's the inevitable " but " -- there 's that passenger airbag cover that just does n't fit. In our last entry we mentioned that we 'd have the dealer take a look at that airbag cover, while checking into the " Service Engine Soon " warning light. Well, the dealer says there 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning light? The engine computer logged an exhaust leak. But the technicians could find none and erased the fault. The light is back on again, so we 're headed back to the dealer. -- don chaikin DRIVERS NOTEBOOK : : This li'l squirt has way more usable and comfortable interior space than many larger, more expensive sedans. : : Roof-mounted antenna or not, radio reception is hit-or-miss, and the radio itself annoys by not activating immediately when switched on. Do n't even ask about Nissan 's " A-B-C " preset system. Oy.
