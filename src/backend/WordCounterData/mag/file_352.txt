2043341 Had enough of winter? Use this frugal Yankee 's plan to fish 10 places where the weather 's fine, the bite is hot, and the cash stays in your pocket IN THE HARD reality of a New England January, I 'm scraping ice off my truck or plowing yet another snowfall from my driveway. In my daydreams, though, I 'm fishing somewhere warm, wishing I did n't have to wait four months for the spring thaw. Sure, I could book a $5,000 week at a tropical lodge, but one way or another the mortgage and the taxes and the kids ' tuition usually manage to intervene. * So I sometimes travel and fish cheaply. I go to places where at the very least I do n't have to confront a blizzard, and at best I 'm squishing sun-warmed sand between my toes. If you 're willing to explore, to paddle a rented kayak or canoe, and to camp out on your own, there 's a whole world of low-budget getaways that do n't involve high-end lodge fees and $10 pia coladas. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere. Some are cheaper than others, but all are unbeatable deals. To help you compare costs, I 've priced recent airfares from Chicago as a central location. You 'll generally have to add the price of a rental car, which will run from $125 to $400 or more a week. Most of these trips will involve some work in putting travel details together, but even that is enjoyable anticipation. And it sure beats shoveling snow.

Camping overnight on a small island or chikee( elevated platform) gives you more fishing time in the backcountry. Back in Everglades City, meanwhile, you can stay with my pals at the Ivey House lodge( iveyhouse.com) for $85 a night and have a fresh grouper sandwich with a cold beer at the fish dock across the street as you watch the sun go down.

TEMPS : 38 HIGH, 16 LOW ROUND-TRIP AIRFARE TO ALBUQUERQUE : $230 ACCOMMODATIONS : CAMPING AT $8 PER NIGHT Okay, this may not be what you 'd call a " warm " getaway, but the San Juan tailwater is one of America 's best winter trout fisheries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the sort of cloudy weather that brings on intense bluewing olive hatches and rising trout.

Bonefish prowl the flat in front, where I 've watched them tailing before I even got out of bed in the morning.

Explorer Chartbooks( explorercharts.com) offers a series of maps that 's very helpful for navigating unmarked secondary roads and locating bonefish flats.

TEMPS : 60 HIGH, 45 LOW ROUND-TRIP AIRFARE TO HOUSTON : $250 ACCOMMODATIONS : CAMPING AT $8 PER NIGHT Texas redfishing is hot from the Louisiana border all the way west and south through Padre Island National Seashore. The area around Aransas Pass just northeast of Corpus Christi harbors lots of protected shallows for both kayakers and redfish.( From most major cities, it 's cheaper to fly to Houston than to Corpus Christi, and because most rental cars have unlimited mileage, driving the 200 miles from Houston is a better deal.) For kayak rentals and guided fishing, check out the aptly named Slow Ride Guide Service in Aransas Pass( slowrideguide.com).

Hire a cheap car at San Antonio( about $125 a week) and drive southwest to your campsite at the Lake Amistad National Recreation Area( nps.gov/amis). That frugality puts a powerboat rental from one of several local marinas( about $125 a day) within your means. Or start with a day 's guided fishing at the area 's going rate of $300 a day for two anglers. It just might be the best bassing you 'll have all year.

Consider Driving Even for trips of 1,000 miles or more, jumping in your truck may be your best option. For example, it 's about 1,500 miles from my Vermont home to the Everglades. My wife and I can drive nonstop in four-hour shifts and take more gear in my truck, including the kayaks we already own. We save a combined $400 in airfare, about $200 on car rental, and roughly $400 on kayak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @). The round-trip gasoline cost is about $450 ; the $550 we bank easily covers costs for the rest of the trip. 2. Shop for Airfare Many people buy airline tickets through websites such as travelocity.com, expedia.com, or orbitz.com. These aggregators charge a fee. Some similar sites -- notablykayak.com( which has nothing to do with kayaks) -- charge no fee and do a much better job. In addition, all the foregoing sites omit some airlines from their listings. The only way to check fares on Southwest Airlines, for example, is by going directly to southwest.com, where the prices are usually among the lowest around. The service is generally excellent, too. 3. Make Your Own Meals Camping out and doing your own cooking is almost always the cheapest option.( I do n't suggest doing this in many areas outside the United States -- it 's not always safe.) If you 're flying, just fill one checked duffel bag with camping gear to the 50-pound limit imposed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a very substantial backpack. Then pack your second bag with tackle and clothing to the same weight limit. Buy your food at your destination 's local supermarket so you do n't have to check it as luggage.
