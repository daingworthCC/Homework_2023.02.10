2017941 // Not so longago we had a quiet little game. Golfers were a clannish bunch and we kept mostly to ourselves. We did n't draw much attention, except during the major championships when Arnold Palmer or Jack Nichlaus got the attention of non-golfers four times a year. We learned the game from our fathers or by hanging out at the golf courses or from a kind pro who did n't charge $150 for half an hour of his wisdom. We played with forged blades and persimmon woods with steel shafts. Balata off a Bull 's Eye was the best feeling in the game. Then, one day-and it 's difficult to pick out exactly when that was-the perception of our game changed. Was it during the go-go 1980 's, when the ubiquitos Baby Boomers started playing golf in increasing numbers? Was it prior to the 1990 PGA Championship at Shoal Creek, which opened the Pandora 's Box of private club integration and forced golf to open its arms to people of both sexes and all colors? Was it sometime after the 1987 Ryder Cup, when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating the Ryder Cup as golfs most thrilling spectator event even for non-golfers? Was it during the 1991 PGA Championship, when John Daly and his white driver with the red shaft gripped and ripped his way into blue-collar hearts and invited those who had never played before to give golf a try? Or was it three years ago, when Tiger Woods exploded into the professional game and declared, " I want golf to look like America. " Who knows how to delineate when the so-called " golf boom " actually arrived or whether it actually did? Although there have been some fluctuations in the number of golfers in the United States, the number of rounds played each year has been flat since 1986. Still, golf is hotter than at any time in its history. And, the scorching from its afterburners has left an indelible mark. Today, $100 green fees and $500 titanium drivers seem to be the rule rather than the exception. We built a course a day for 10 years, as we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots golfers still ca n't get starting times. Millions came to our game, including movie stars, rock stars, athletes from other sports, and corporate titans. But millions left during the same period. Was golf too expensive? Too time-consuming? Too hard? All of the above? Research shows that more people watch golf on television than ever before and that there are more people who want to play than are actually playing. What 's stopping them? Has all the progress of the last few years made our game better? And where are we headed from here? As golf-and the rest of the world-approaches the 21st century, GOLF MAGAZINE will conduct an examination of the issues that affect all golfers, from public to private, young to old, beginners to tournament players. What follows is a preview of the in-depth articles that will appear, one a month, between June and November. And in December, with the year 2000 a tap-in away, we 'll ask for your opinions. Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's vital we take a hard look at what will keep it that way. June : Access Nearly nine years has passed since the ugly situation reared its head at Shoal Creek Country Club, outside Birmingham, Alabama, site of the 1990 PGA Championship. The club 's membership was all white and club president Hall Thompson said out loud that he intended that it remain that way. The reverberations heightened public awareness, which caused hundreds of private clubs to stop their segregationist membership practices. The fallout was considerable. None of the major golf organizations would allow tournaments to be held at clubs that were n't integrated. Even Augusta National, which usually does what it wants, welcomed a black member into its green-jacketed enclave. What did these changes mean for the rest of us? For one, our game was analyzed, dissected, sliced, and diced like never before. We became aware of other people 's conceptions-sometimes misconceptions-about golf. As a result of this scrutiny, governing bodies have made access a priority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible programs that attempt to make golf more accessible to children, especially those in inner cities. For the average golfer, there has never been a better time or opportunity to play. According to a National Golf Foundation study released in January, the number of golf courses in the U.S. has tripled-from about 5,000 to 15,000-since 1950. The number of golfers per course has increased almost five times-400 to 1,950during the same period. The study says, " The growth of public access golf is the story of the last three decades. By the year 2000, daily fee courses( privately owned, publicly accessible facilities) will account for approximately half of all golf facility inventory. " Private courses will account for only 30 percent of the number of courses, a complete reversal from the 60 percent the study showed in 1950. All of which means that you do n't have to belong to a private club anymore to have access to quality golf. In fact, according to the figures, just the opposite is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said a course a day must be built for the next 10 years to meet demand. Well, that was done, but neither the number of golfers nor the number of rounds played increased significantly to meet the supply. In 1986, the average number of golfers per course was 1,900, at a time when demand was outracing supply. Today, that trend is in reverse. Utilization rates have decreased from a high in 1990 of 90 percent utilization-based on a desired rate of 48,800 rounds a year per course-to 80 percent in 1998. Unless more players are found, that number is likely to decrease as more courses are being built. Expect to see, according to the NGF, 350 to 450 new courses opened each year for the next three to five years. That 's more than a course a day. The NGF predicts a 2.6 percent annual growth in courses as opposed to a 1.5 percent annual growth in players. That could drive the desired utilization rate down to 77 percent in 2010 and create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. All those figures, while predicting dire times for the industry, should be good news for avid golfers who drive the game 's economy. Why? Because this means courses should be less crowded in the coming years. July : Cost Ever wonder what happened to the $1.50 golf ball, the $20 green fees, the $5,000 club initiation? Or simply the days when you could hang your coat on a hook and go play? Gone forever, unfortunately. You once could play Pebble Beach or St. Andrews for $10. Today, even if you can get a starting time, you 'll have to pony up $295 for Pebble and $160 for St. Andrews. My, how times have changed. The Americanization of the game has forced a new meaning to the words " demographic " and " high-end. " Bigger is better in our lexicon, whether it comes in the guise of courses, equipment, second homes, or club memberships. But golf in our country has always been income driven. Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that regard, the game is as elitist as ever. Twenty-two percent of the nation 's golfers play 70 percent of the rounds and account for 61 percent of the spending on golf. That avid minority drives the golf business, and the items they buy keep escalating in price. Apparently golfers can afford it because that segment of the population is flush with disposable income. The wholesale price of golf clubs has doubled since 1986 ; so have green fees and cart fees. The NGF study shows that golfers ' spending has almost tripled since 1986-from $7.8 billion to $22 billion in 1997. There are no signs of any slowdown. August : Etiquette Golf has long suffered an image problem of one kind or another. There is the pervasive notion that golf is a country-club game. Statistics prove otherwise. Today, the image that disturbs a large segment of the population is that of the cigar-smoking, cell phone-talking, " you-da-man " yelling, noveaugauche golfer who seems pervasive both on the course and in galleries at PGA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for attracting a new breed of fan, those who like their caps backward, their pants baggy, and their beer cold. But at the grass-roots level, even at the most exclusive clubs, niceties that were taken for granted are being ignored. For example : repairing ball marks, replacing divots, raking bunkers, talking while someone else is playing. Over the years, etiquette was taught by observing experienced, often more skilled players. It was handed down through generations and respected as part of the game. Today, we seem to have a difficult time teaching newcomers and making it stick. Some think new golfers are ignorant of the game 's traditions, others believe they simply have the attitude, " I 've paid my money, I can do what I want. " Either way, some wonder who will carry the message to the next group of golfers. September : Pace of Play Golf simply takes too long to play, from public courses to the PGA Tour. Who wants to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting on every shot, thereby leaving one( or both) of your weekend days shot to hell? The answer : no one. But courses around the country are jammed wall to wall with players every weekend suffering the aforementioned fate. Why are we out there so long? A handful of reasons, none of which seems to have equal weight. First, there is the Tour influence. Professional players, as a group, are notoriously slow, and we tend to mimic the pros whenever possible. Look for any example close to home. Anything that has the word " tournament " attached to it will automatically add 45 minutes to an hour to the time of the round. Second, there are many new courses that sometimes take as long to get from green to tee as vice versa. A great number of them boast the four most dreaded words in golf : " Carts On Paths Only, " which adds 30 to 45 minutes to a round. Sometimes courses jam too many starting times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The result is a crowded course with no place to go. The British do n't have problems with slow play. They think 3 1/2 hours is an abomination( and they 're right about that). They also do n't use carts. How do they do it? October : Technology At no other time in the game has technology grown so much, so fast, or have golfers bought so many golf clubs so fast. Yet, we do n't seem to be getting better. While we do n't understand why, we still keep buying equipment. " Equipment technology and better marketing have shortened the purchase cycle of golf equipment, " the NGF study says. If we are not improving, is technology at least making the game more forgiving, thereby more fun? Certainly senior players have benefitted from new clubs, balls, and shafts to compensate for their loss in flexibility and strength. The rest of us are probably hitting the ball farther and straighter than we ever have, even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand, technology takes the blame on the professional level for more distance, which is supposed to translate into lower scores. Certainly, newer and better equipment shoulders its share of the burden, but not all the responsibility should be laid at the feet of the manufacturers. Technology has also developed better methods of course conditioning, making fairways firmer and faster while greens on the Tours are almost always nearly perfect. No wonder the pros hit it so far and make so many putts. The argument can be made that technology is merely the natural outgrowth of a booming economy. However, the game 's ruling bodies feel threatened by technological breakthroughs. Is this really an issue or is it simply a butting of heads of the old guard and the new? November : The Tours The largest sphere of influence in golf belongs to the professional Tours. They control most of the big money in the game, and they hold sway-unwittingly perhaps-over what we wear, the equipment we use, and how quickly( or slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purses this year and three World Golf Championship events will pay the winners $1 million each in official money. We could see the leading money winner this season make $3 million or more. Golf fans will benefit from the Tours ' largesse. Because of the newly negotiated television contracts, for the first time every round of every PGA Tour event will be on the tube. Clothing and equipment manufacturers are happy about that knowing that part of the money they spend on television will be offset by having their staff players on camera for some " free " advertising. In turn, companies hope that if viewers see their favorite players wielding a certain club or wearing a certain shirt, they will rush out to their nearest pro shop or retailer and whip out their favorite credit card. And as long as we keep buying, they 'll keep selling. That 's the way of golf 's brave new world. Beginning next month, we 'll take a closer look at each of these issues, and how they will @ @ @ @ @
