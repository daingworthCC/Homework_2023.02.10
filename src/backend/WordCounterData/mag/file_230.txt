2027741 Section : Digital Muse <p> MY OWN TECHNOLOGY STORY begins as a child, with me hearing music in the air and halhucinating scenes in the cracks of the ceiling in my parents ' bedroom. I knew that seeing visions in plaster separated me from other kids, and I sure did n't want to tell anybody. So when I saw my father take a blank piece of paper, put it into a virtually colorless liquid, and then pull out this image of me at the zoo, it made me believe that my " floating mind " was going to play an important part in my future. In this way, the very concept of photography changed my life. <p> Music had the same effect. I remember being about 15 and going down to a dance on Saturday night and hearing the first bars of the Everly Brothers singing " Bye Bye Love : ' It stopped me in my tracks. It did for me what I 've been trying to do ever since with notes and words. <p> Along the way, technology influenced me in a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first. It was the first time I was able to hear anything louder than myself, It was a similar thing when I went into my first real recording session at a BBC studio in London in the early 1960s. It totally changed the way I thought about music, especially because of the ability to layer the sound. I was with the Hollies then, and we did our first two-track recording. Then we began working with a four-track machine. Wow. We could then do double vocals, and it thickened the sound right up. When I was out of the Hollies and joined Crosby and Stills, it was " Wow " again -- now we had eight trades to play with. Today, I have a 12-inch box I take around with me that has 64 tracks, no tape, just straight to a hard drive. I have 29 new songs that are stored on the one-gigabyte drive. <p> My first computer was an old 512K Macintosh. I started to use it really early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scanning software, really primitive black-and-white stuff. I 'd scan in an image 1 made and plug it into photo-enhancing software called Digital Darkroom. I 'd mess around to get the image I wanted. <p> My friend, the singer Joni Mitchell, is a painter and she told me about a nice experience she had had with a gallery in Tokyo. I sent them some of my photographs and they said, " Great, send us 50 images blown up to four feet by five feet. " <p> I thought, Holy shit, this was a really daunting task the chemical toxic waste alone from producing these size images was huge. It was about this time that I saw one of the first Iris Graphics ink-jet printers. I decided if we could bend and shape the machine to what we wanted, we could create great art. <p> I bought the machine in 1988 for $140.000. And after I did my own prints, some friends and I decided that with all of the money invested, we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it turned into a business called Nash Editions, a company that has now done work for David Hockhey, Allen Ginsberg, and other artists. This year, in fact, we had our first million-dollar year. <p> My most ambitious use of technology is my " LifeSighs " show, a live multimedia tour through my life that we have produced six times now. Before that, in 1988, I was offered four speaking engagements at U.S. colleges. At first I did n't know what to do. Give me a guitar and a piano and I can play all day. But an hour of talking? <p> I mugged up an hour and did my first gig at Kent State. It was an eye-opening experience. I realized that if I could find a way to show the kids what I was talking about while I talked, it could become a very interesting and useful form of entertainment. I decided to create a database of my life, to find every available photograph, video, and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every place I had visited. It was an enormous task doable only with major computer power. I went to Silicon Graphics and explained what I wanted to do. They sent two million-dollar Onyx machines to my house, each of which had a gigabyte of RAM. <p> The first show was in the Annenberg Theatre at the University of Pennsylvania. And while I was live onstage, the information went back and forth over high-speed fiber lines to the two Onyx computers in Los Angeles. It crunched the scene I instructed and sent characters and images back to me in real time. <p> One of the interesting problems we fatal was that electronic signals going 6,000 miles still take time, and 1 had a 10-millisecond delay, Part of the show involves me playing live with David Crosby in Los Angeles in what you have to call " cyberjamming, " an absolutely new space. It involves a different kind of intelligance, with incredibly weird spaces and timing. I 've slant my life as a musician getting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical time in a very different way. In that cyberworld everything gets slightly rubbery, and your job is to erase the 10-millisecond delay by anticipating things to come up before they do. It involves an even greater element of trust than playing live. <p> Actually, doing " LifeSighs " live made me see, first of all, that I was n't in charge. For me, it 's a miraculous thing, and at the first show, I was really proud of the fact that nobody in the history of the planet had done technologically what I did that night. <p> PHOTO( BLACK &; WHITE) : Graham Nash <p> By GRAHAM NASH <p> <p> Graham Nash, musician, first won recognition as a founding member of the Hollies.
