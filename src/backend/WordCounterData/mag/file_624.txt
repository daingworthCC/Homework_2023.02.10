In other words, your need for an adviser boils down not to the amount you have but to whether or not you 're able to find answers to questions you have and then follow through on your own. # Paying an adviser can also be worthwhile if your financial situation is complexsay, you own a small business or a rental property, says Christine Benz, director of personal finance at Morningstar. You may want help, too, if you 're paralyzed by fear, you 're prone to chasing hot funds, or you tend to overreact to market swings as well. A pro can help you keep your emotions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to set up a trust for my son and grandkid. Who should manage it? # JUDY GILLIS, Crossroads, Texas # A # " You want some-one you can trust implicitly with the financial responsibilities of managing the trust and carrying out your desires, " says Greg Sellers, CPA, president of the National Association of Estate Planners &amp; Councils. Duties include investing the money, maintaining records, filing taxes, and paying beneficiaries. # Sellers recommends pairing a trusted relative with a financial or legal professional. That way, the trust has both an advocate for the beneficiaries and an experienced manager. # A corporate trustee will take 0.75% to 2.5% of assets a year, though. To get professional help for less, you could suggest that your relative hire a lawyer, a CPA, or an investment firm on an hourly or per-project basis as needed rather than appointing the firm or individual as co-trustee. # Q # CAREER # I work for a small firm. My boss 's daughter works there too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NAME WITHHELD # A # Assuming her actions affect business, you could set up a meeting to delicately inform your boss about the issues and ask for advice on handling them. As much as your manager loves his kid, he probably does n't want to lose clients or valuable employees, says corporate trainer Dana Brownlee, founder of Professionalism Matters. # A less awkward way to make your manager aware is to simply suggest that the company shift to a 360 employee-review process, in which the boss solicits anonymous feedback on her( and everyone else) from people at all levels. # Best case, the daughter gets a talking to. Do n't expect her to get fired. " Your boss clearly wants her to play a role in the company, " Brownlee says. " If you ca n't live with that, find a new job.
