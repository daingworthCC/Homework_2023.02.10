He shot 39.4 percent from the field and 32.1 percent from beyond the arc. <p> Given how few recent first-round picks are still with the Suns, it 's fair to wonder how much of Bender 's problems were down to his surroundings. Few teams are moredysfunctionalthan Phoenix, which is n't an ideal situation for a young player who needs a lot of work to shape out his game. <p> Alex Len, a 2013 first-rounder, left as a free agent last offseason. The Suns traded Marquese Chriss and Josh Jackson from the 2017 draft before faced with the dilemma of offering them a second contract. They also traded 2014 pick T.J. Warren, who 's on a pretty reasonablefour-year, $47 milliondeal, to the Indiana Pacers for reasons thatare n't immediately clear. <p> Simply getting out of Phoenix is a step in the right direction for Bender. <p> Joining Milwaukee is a shrewd move for both parties. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trades. This is the kind of risk they should take to fill out their bench.

The 7 ' 1 ", 225-pound Croatia native shot 36.6 percent on threes in 2017-18 and also boasted a 53.8 effective field-goal percentage on catch-and-shoots, perNBA.com.
