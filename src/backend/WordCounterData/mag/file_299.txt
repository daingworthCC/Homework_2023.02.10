2036241 The sentiment " A land without a people for a people without a land " is and old justification for colonization. Most history books imply that the sixteenth-century Europeans who " settled " the Americas found a wilderness sparsely populated by " savages. " But what Columbus " discovered " was already home to between 72 and 75 million people -- a population approximately as large as Europe 's. North America alone( including what is now Canada, Alaska, and the contiguous U.S.) was inhabited by an estimated 7 million people of more than 1,000 nations who spoke hundreds of different languages. Their societies ranged from matrifocal to patriarchal. They practiced agriculture, art, architecture, and trade ; some practiced war( though the Pimas in what is now Arizona required veterans to go through postwar " cures " for insanity). The 500 years since Columbus ' arrival reek of conquest, betrayal, land seizure, forced religious conversion, relocation, and decimation of the aboriginal population by war, disease, poverty, alcoholism, and the suicide of despair. Today, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the national average, the average life expectancy is 47 years ; and approximately one quarter of all Native women have been sterilized without their consent. As our contribution to the counter-quincentenary observances, Ms. offers this report on the women of the Americas " B.C. "( before Columbus). It is up to all of us to learn who the Native women of the Americas are today( see pages 22, 26, 62 and 69) and hearken to their voices. SKY WOMAN AND HER SISTERS Not until recently have American Indian women chosen to define themselves politically as Indian women -- a category that retains their basic racial and cultural identity but distinguishes women as a separate political force in a tribal, racial, and cultural context. This self-redefinition among Indian women who intend that their former stature be restored has resulted from several political factors. The status of tribal women has seriously declined over the centuries of white dominance, as they have been all but voiceless in tribal decision-making bodies since reconstitution of the tribes through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stan Steiner observes in The New Indians, the breakdown of women 's status in tribal communities led to their migration in large numbers into the cities, where they regained the self-sufficiency and positions of influence they had held in earlier centuries. He writes, " Election of tribal women to the leadership of these urban Indian centers has been a phenomenon in modern Indian life. " Women function as council members and tribal chairs for at least one fourth of the federally recognized tribes. In February 1981, the Albuquerque Journal reported that 67 American Indian tribes had women heads of state. The coming of the white man created chaos in all the old systems, the success of which depended on complementary institutions and organized relationships among all sectors of their world. The significance of each part was seen as necessary to the balanced and harmonious functioning of the whole, and both private and public aspects of life were viewed as valuable and necessary components of society. The private( " inside ") was shared by all, though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or by initiates into ritual societies, some of which were gender-specific and some of which were not. Most were male-dominated or female-dominated with helping roles assigned to members of the opposite gender. One category of inside societies was exclusive to " berdaches " -- males only -- and " berdaches " -- females only.( The term " berdaches " is applied -- or rather misapplied -- to both lesbian women and gay males. It is originally an Arabic word meaning sex-slave boy, or a male child used sexually by adult males. As such it has no relevance to American Indian men or women.) All categories of ritual societies function in present-day American Indian communities, though the exclusively male societies are best recorded in ethnographic literature. The " outside " was characterized by various social institutions, all of which had bearing on the external welfare of the group : hunting, gathering, building, ditch cleaning, horticulture, seasonal and permanent moves, intertribal relationships, law and policy decisions affecting the whole, crafts, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government policies ; the inside institutions were most affected by Christianization. Destruction of the institutions rested on the overthrow or subversion of the gynocratic nature of the tribal system. Consider, for example, John Adair 's remark about the Cherokee, as reported by Carolyn Foreman( Indian Women Chiefs, Zenger Publishing) : " The Cherokee had been for a considerable while under petticoat government and they were just emerging, like all of the Iroquoian Indians, from the matriarchal period. " Adair 's idea of " petticoat government " included the power of the Women 's Council of the Cherokee. The head of the council was the Beloved Woman of the Nation, " whose voice was considered that of the Great Spirit, speaking through her. " The Iroquoian peoples, including the Hurons and the Susquehanna, set the penalty for killing a woman at double that for killing a man. The Iroquois story is currently one of the best chronicles of the overthrow of the gynocracy. Material about the status of women in North American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crow, Hopi, Pomo, Yurok, Kiowa, and Natchez, and in South American groups such as the Bari and Mapuche, to name just a few, is lacking. Any original documentation that exists is buried under the flood of published material written from the colonizer 's patriarchal perspective. Male dominance may have characterized a number of tribes, but it was by no means as universal( or even as preponderant) as colonialist propaganda has led us to believe. The Seneca prophet Handsome Lake did not appreciate " petticoat government " any more than did John Adair. When his code became the standard for Iroquoian practice in the early nineteenth century, power shifted from the hands of the " meddling old women, " as he characterized them, to men. Under the old laws, the Iroquois were a mother-centered, mother-right people whose political organization was based on the central authority of the Matrons, the Mothers of the Longhouses( clans). Handsome Lake advocated that young women cleave to their husbands rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a patriarchal, nuclear family arrangement. Until Handsome Lake 's time, the sachems were chosen from certain families by the Matrons of their clans and were subject to impeachment by the Matrons should they prove inadequate or derelict in carrying out their duties as envisioned by the Matrons and set forth in the Law of the Great Peace of the Iroquois Confederacy. By provision in the Law, the women were to be considered the progenitors of the nation, owning the land and the soil. At the end of the Revolutionary War, the Europeans declared the Iroquois living on the U.S. side of the United States-Canadian border defeated. Pressed from all sides, their fields burned and salted, the traditional power of the Matrons under assault from missionaries who flocked to Iroquois country to " civilize " them, the Iroquois became a captive people. Into this chaos stepped Handsome Lake, who encouraged the shift from woman-centered to patriarchal society. The Iroquois were not the only nation to fall under patriarchalization. No tribe escaped that fate, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the latter half of the twentieth century. Among the hundreds of tribes forced into patriarchal modes, the experiences of the Montagnais-Naskapi, the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Algonkians, and the Bari of Colombia, among others, round out the hemisphere-wide picture. Among the Narragansett of the area now identified as Rhode Island was a woman chief, one of the six sachems of that tribe. Her name was Magnus, and when the Narragansett were invaded by Major Talcot and defeated in battle, the Sunksquaw Magnus was executed along with 90 others. Her fate was a result of her position ; in contrast, the wife and child of the sachem known as King Philip among the colonizers were sold into slavery in the West Indies.( Like the Anglo-Saxon " forbidden " word " cunt, " " squaw " is now mostly used as an insult to women ; it means " queen " or " lady. " Under patriarchal dominance, the proudest names come to be seen as degrading epithets, which the conquered and conqueror alike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @.) This sunksquaw, or hereditary female head of state, was one of scores in the Mid-Atlantic region. One researcher, Robert Grumet, identifies a number of women chiefs who held office during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Grumet details the nonauthoritarian character of the Mid-Atlantic Coastal-Algonkians and describes their political system, which included inheritance of rank by the eldest child through the maternal line. The first sunksquaw Grumet mentions was noted in John Smith 's journal as " Queene of Appamatuck. " She was present during the council that decided on his death -- a decision that Pocahontas, daughter of one of the sachems, overturned. The Wampanoag Confederacy 's loss of control over the Chesapeake Bay area did not cause an end to the rule of sunksquaws or of the empress : George Fox, founder of the Quakers, recorded that " the old Empress of Accomack... sat in council " when he visited in March 1673. In 1705, Robert Beverley mentioned two towns governed by queens : Pungoteque and Nanduye. Pungoteque, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed Nanduye as " a seat of the Empress. " While Nanduye was a small settlement of " not above 20 families, " the old Empress had " all the Nations of this shore under Tribute. " From before 1620 until her death in 1667, a squaw-sachem known as the " Massachusetts Queen " by the Virginia colonizers governed the Massachusetts Confederacy. The Pocasset sunksquaw Weetamoo was King Philip 's ally and " served as a war chief commanding over 300 warriors " during his war with the British. Queen Weetamoo was given the white woman Mary Rowlandson, who wrote descriptions of the sunksquaw in her captivity narrative. Awashonks, anther queen in the Mid-Atlantic region, was squaw-sachem of the Sakonnet ; she reigned in the later part of the seventeenth century. After fighting against the British during King Philip 's War, she was forced to surrender. Because she then convinced her warriors to fight with the British, she was able to save them from enslavement in the West Indies. The last sunksquaw Grumet mentions was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sachems of the Esopus Confederacy, Mamanuchqua is said to be only one name that she used. The others include Mamareoktwe, Mamaroch, and Mamaprocht, unless they were the names of other Esopus sunksquaws. Grumet wisely comments : " Ethnohistorians have traditionally assigned male gender to native figures in the documentary record unless otherwise identified. They have also tended to not identify native individuals as leaders unless so identified in the specific source. This policy... has successfully masked the identities of a substantial number of Coastal Algonkian leaders of both sexes. " It also falsifies the record of people who are not able to set it straight ; it reinforces patriarchal socialization among all Americans, who are thus led to believe that there have never been any alternative structures ; it masks the genocide attendant on the falsification of evidence, as it masks the gynocidal motive behind the genocide. Politics played an even greater role in the destruction of the Cherokee gynocracy, in a region that included parts of Georgia and North Carolina. Cherokee women had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made by vote of the Women 's Council and relayed to the district at large by the War Woman or Pretty Woman. The decisions had to be made by female clan heads because a captive who was to live would be adopted into one of the families whose affairs were directed by the clanmothers. The clanmothers also had the right to wage war, and the stories about Amazon warriors were not so farfetched considering how many Indian women were famous warriors and powerful voices in the councils. The Women 's Council, as distinguished from the district, village, or confederacy councils, may have had the deciding voice on what males would serve on the councils, as its northern sisters had. Certainly the Women 's Council was influential in tribal decisions, and its spokeswomen served as War Women and as Peace Women. Their other powers included the right to speak in men 's council, the right to inclusion in public policy decisions, the right to choose whom and whether to marry, the right to bear arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the colonization of the Cherokee, the British worked hard to lessen the women 's power. They took Cherokee men to England and educated them in English ways. By the time the Removal Act was under consideration by Congress in the early 1800s, many of these British-educated men wielded considerable power over the nation 's policies. In the ensuing struggle, women endured rape and murder, but they had no voice in the future direction of the Cherokee Nation. The Cherokee were by this time highly stratified, and many were Christianized. The male leadership bought and sold not only black men and women but also men and women of neighboring tribes ; the women of the leadership class retreated to Bible classes, sewing circles, and petticoats that rivaled those worn by their white sisters. In an effort to stave off removal, the Cherokee in the early 1800s, under the leadership of men, drafted a constitution that disenfranchised women and blacks. It was modeled after the Constitution of the United States, whose favor they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern cousins, were entirely represented by men in the white courts, in the U.S. Congress, and in lobbying white officials. The last Beloved Woman, Nancy Ward, resigned her office in 817, sending her cane and her vote on important questions to the Cherokee Council. In spite of their frantic attempts to prevent their removal to Indian Territory by aping the white man in patriarchal particulars, the Cherokee were removed, as were the other tribes of the region and those living north and west of them, whom the Cherokee thought of as " uncivilized. " The cases cited above might be explained as a general conquest over male Indian systems that happened to have some powerful women functioning within them, rather than as a deliberate attempt to wipe out female leadership. But the case of the Montagnais women clarifies an otherwise obscure issue. The Montagnais-Naskapi of the St. Lawrence Valley were contacted early in the fifteenth century by fur traders and explorers, and later fell under the sway of Jesuit missionizing. The good fathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies and convince men and women that a woman 's proper place was under the authority of her husband and a man 's proper place under the authority of the priests. In pursuit of this end, the priests had to undermine the status of the women, who, according to one of Father Paul Le Jeune 's reports, had " great power.... A man may promise you something and if he does not keep his promise, he thinks he is sufficiently excused when he tells you that his wife did not wish him to do it. " Undaunted, Le Jeune composed a plan which, he was certain, would turn the Montagnais into proper, civilized people. He figured that the first requirement was the establishment of permanent settlements and the placement of officially constituted authority in the hands of one person. More ominously, he believed that the institution of punishment was essential. He was most distressed that the " savages " thought physical abuse a terrible crime. He commented on this aberration in a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abduction or seduction of the children to Jesuit-run schools located a good distance from their homes. Last, Le Jeune wished to implement a new social system whereby the Montagnais would live within the European family structure with its twin patriarchal institutions of male authority and female fidelity. These would be enforced by the simple expediency of forbidding divorce. Le Jeune had his work cut out for him : working with people who, in his own words, could not " endure in the least those who seem desirous of assuming superiority over the others ; they place all virtue in a certain gentleness, " who "... imagine that they ought by right of birth, to enjoy the liberty of wild ass colts, rendering no homage to anyone whomsoever, except when they like. " The wily Le Jeune did succeed in some measure. While the Montagnais retained their love of gentleness and nurturing, they became rather more male-centered than not. Shamans were male, leaders were male, and matrilocality had become patrilocality. With the rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation of Indians in Canada -- which is different in details but identical in intent and disastrous effect to that of Indians in the United States -- the Montagnais will likely be fully patriarchal before the turn of the next century. Montagnais men who would not subscribe to the Jesuit program( and there were many) were not given authority. Under patriarchy men are given power only if they use it in ways congruent with the authoritarian, punitive model. The records attest, in contrast, that gynecentric systems distribute power evenly among men, women, and berdaches as well as among all age groups. Economic distribution follows a similar pattern ; reciprocal exchange of goods and services among individuals and between groups is ensured because women are in charge at all points along the distribution network. Effecting the social transformation from egalitarian, gynecentric systems to hierarchical, patriarchal systems requires meeting four objectives. The first is accomplished when the primacy of female as creator is replaced by male-gendered creators( generally generic, as the Great Spirit concept overtakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has largely been met across North America. The Hopi goddess Spider Woman has become Maseo or Tawa, referred to in the masculine, and the Zuni goddess is on her way to malehood. Changing Woman of the Navajo has contenders for her position, while the Keres Thought Woman trembles on the brink of displacement by her sister-goddess-cum-god Utset. Among the Cherokee, the goddess of the river foam is replaced by Thunder in many tales, and the Iroquois divinity Sky Woman now gets her ideas and powers from her dead father or her monstrous grandson. The second objective is achieved when tribal governing institutions and philosophies are destroyed. The conqueror has demanded that the tribes that wish federal recognition and protection institute " democracy, " in which powerful officials are elected by majority vote. Until recently, these powerful officials were inevitably male and were elected mainly by nontraditionals, the traditionals being, until recently, unwilling to participate in a form of governance imposed on them by right of conquest. Democracy by coercion is hardly democracy. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off their lands, deprived of their economic livelihood, and forced to curtail or end pursuits on which their ritual system, philosophy, and subsistence depend. Now dependent on white institutions for survival, tribal systems can ill afford gynocracy when patriarchy requires male dominance. Not that submission to white laws and customs results in economic prosperity ; the unemployment rates on most reservations is about 50 to 60 percent, and the situation for urban Indians who are undereducated( as many are) is almost as bad. The fourth objective requires that the clan structure be replaced, in fact if not theory, by the nuclear family. Women clan heads are replaced by elected male officials and the psychic net that is formed and maintained by the nature of nonauthoritarian gynecentricity grounded in respect for diversity of gods and people, is thoroughly rent. Decimation of populations through starvation, disease, and disruption of all social, spiritual, and economic structures along with abduction and brainwashing of the young serve in meeting this goal. Along the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degynocraticization is subject to image control and information control. Recasting archaic tribal versions of tribal history, customs, institutions, and the oral tradition increases the likelihood that the patriarchal revisionist versions of tribal life, skewed or simply made up by patriarchal non-Indians and patriarchalized Indians, will be incorporated into the spiritual and popular traditions of the tribes. This is reinforced by the loss of rituals, medicine societies, and entire clans, through assimilation and a dying off of tribal members familiar with the elder rituals and practices. Consequently, Indian control of the image-making and information-distributing process is crucial, and the contemporary prose and poetry of American Indian writers, particularly woman-centered writers, is a major part of Indian resistance to cultural and spiritual genocide.

The Spaniards ' attitude on meeting a new race of human beings is indicated by Columbus ' reflection that they would make good servants. As for the women, he noted in his journal that they had " very pretty bodies. " The Taino were generally monogamous, Columbus reported, but in Spanish military tradition, the victors in Gaule had absolute rights to the goods and women of the vanquished. The stage was set for trouble, but Columbus sailed confidently back to Spain, leaving on Hispaniola 40 members of his crew and a small fort that they had constructed and named La Navidad. The purpose of his second voyage a year later was to found a colony on Hispaniola, an ambitious but bizarre Venture. The Spanish sovereigns, Isabella and Ferdinand, authorized Columbus to assemble a fleet of 17 vessels, and to freight them with everything necessary for the settlement : great stores of food, weapons, gunpowder, tools for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, horses, and livestock. Volunteers for the voyage were plentiful : rumors had circulated about gold for the asking in the Indies. Columbus took on 1,500 men, including agricultural workers, physicians, shipwrights, artisans, government officials, soldiers, sailors, priests, and friars. Yet, while stowing the rootstock of European civilization aboard the ships, the Spaniards omitted one vital element : women. Nothing could more vividly demonstrate women 's virtual invisibility in the public life of sixteenth-century Spain. In affluent Spanish families, the social activities of women were more rigidly controlled than in any other European nation, with the possible exception of Portugal. This was due in part to prolonged contact with Muslim culture : Moors( North African Muslims) had ruled parts of the Iberian peninsula for centuries. When Spanish women ventured onto the streets, they partly veiled their faces and were accompanied by chaperons. Spanish patriarchs protected as a point of personal honor the virginity of daughters and sexual faithfulness of wives by secluding them within their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clergy had mistresses and acknowledged offspring. On weighing anchor at Hispaniola for the second time, Columbus received an unpleasant surprise : La Navidad had been destroyed and the crew members who had stayed behind were dead -- murdered. One of the new settlers explained in a letter to a friend what had driven the peaceful Taino to such violence : " Bad feeling arose and broke out into warfare because of the licentious conduct or our men toward the Indian women, for each Spaniard had five women to minister to his pleasure. " It became clear that growing, stable settlements in the Indies had to be established if Spain was to retain its new possessions and to reap their wealth. Such communities meant families -- and families meant women. But many Spanish men were not eager to settle down and populate the wilderness. They had another agenda : to seek adventure and glory ; to prove their physical courage and sexual prowess ; to get rich and return to Europe. As for wives in Spain, few evinced any desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to do so. Traditions regarding female property rights and inheritance gave Spanish women of means the economic independence to say no. Married women could own property in their own names and sign legal documents. The archives of sixteenth-century Seville reveal women 's signatures on wills, marriage contracts, dowry agreements, property deeds, and other papers. According to the Venetian ambassador in 1525, so many of Seville 's men had gone to the Indies that the city was " in the hands of women. " The Crown promulgated numerous ordinances to encourage husbands and wives to live in the colony. As early as 1501, economic incentives we offered to emigrating families. One contract stipulated that a third more land be allotted to husbands than to bachelors ; another granted a tax rebate to husbands who emigrated accompanied by wives and furnishings. Various edicts directed that no married man could remain on Hispaniola without his wife or more than three years. Another tactic of the Crown was to transport impoverished Spanish single women to the Indies as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time, Seville had more women than men of marriageable age. Among poor women who did not marry, many earned their bread as street vendors, textile workers, domestic servants, and even as stonemasons. When Columbus was readying his third voyage, in 1497, the Crown authorized him to carry 300 colonists to Hispaniola, one tenth of whom could be female. The sovereigns agreed to pay a salary and provide daily maintenance for the male voyagers -- but the women were to earn their way by their labor. Any women who accepted these ungenerous terms were the first in a long line of indentured females who came to the New World. In the following years, Ferdinand sanctioned the emigration of poor single women of " good character " -- if they were not Jews, Moors, or new Christians( recent converts) -- and many came, including some from the proscribed groups. The Crown delayed founding convents in the New World so that the daughters of Spain would marry instead of seeking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial traffic in women : the importation of female Christian " white slaves " to the Indies. The sources do not specify who such women were to be. But white female slavery was not alien to Spaniards of that era. Under the Moors, Christian female captives had been sold as servants and concubines in the slave market at Cordoba. In Christian Spain, Moorish and Jewish women were enslaved. Still, the number of Spanish women who emigrated in the early decades amounted to a mere trickle. When Nicolas de Ovando sailed to Hispaniola in 1502, he bought a company of 2,500 colonists that included only 73 females.( He also had a license to bring Christian black slaves born in Spain -- the first notice in the historical record of black slavery in the New World.) Ovando observed on his arrival that nearly all of the approximately 300 male settlers who had been there for some time had Indian concubines ; 15 years later, an official reported that on Hispaniola " two out of three Spaniards are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male settlers evidently felt free to disregard the edicts of the king -- who was not only far away but was known to have five " illegitimate " children. During the half century following Columbus, fewer than 10 percent -- possibly as low as 6 percent -- of Spanish passengers to the Indies were females. A judge in Mexico City wrote to a merchant in Seville : " If you are to send any merchandise, let it be women, which is the best business now in this country. " Nevertheless, women were among those who founded the first settlements in the present United States. When Pedro Menendez de Aviles landed in St. Augustine, Florida, in 1565, he had with him 1,500 people, including 27 families. In 1598, Juan de Onate led a wagon train of 130 Spanish soldiers and colonists and up to 800 Native Americans and Africans, to found the first European settlement in New Mexico. The official roll call shows no females. However, other surviving documents identify 25 soldiers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80-day march, and also refer to numerous Native women servants and African female slaves. Throughout Spanish America, Native men and women were allocated to settlers as forced labor under the infamous system of repartimiento. The women toiled alongside men in the fields and mines, but were most frequently seen as domestic servants. A letter written in 1570 by a property owner in Peru gives some idea of the women in a single household : " I have in Trujillo two black women who make bread and cook for everyone, and a mulatto woman who serves Ana Lopez his wife, evidently Spanish, embroidering and sewing and serving at table along with the Indian women and girls. There are five or six other Indian women who are laundresses and help the black women make bread. " Everywhere, Spanish farmers, plantation owners, miners, and soldiers were domiciled with servant or slave women. Fathers often disavowed their children of mixed Spanish and Native( or Spanish and African) parentage. The Crown urged men to marry women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonial unions were predominantly interracial, not solemnized by church or state, sexually exploitative, unstable, and imbued with a master-servant tenor. By the end of the sixteenth century, the legacy of Columbus was a society divided by class, race, and sex discrimination, and united by a common vocabulary of oppression -- limpieza de sangre( purity of blood), creole, mestizo, mulatto -- and by traditions of male domination : concubinage, female seclusion, machismo.
