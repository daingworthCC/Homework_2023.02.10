" My father, Dr. Nathaniel D. Walker, always said that if you want to make a difference in this world, you must first get an education. ' I learned the value of education through his life because he worked after school and paid his way through Talladega College. He also paid his way through medical school at Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina. " Her mother, she said, was equally committed to education. " My mother, Mrs. Ethel McAlpine Walker, was the principal of the high school and taught education and art at the college level at Selma University. I went to Talladega, my father 's alma mater, because I was, frankly, a daddy 's girl. My sister, who became a Ph.D. professor at Providence College in Providence, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's alma mater. I had two brothers who became physicians and practiced medicine in Chicago and Los Angeles. So, you can see, mine is a family with a history of a love for education and UNCF schools. " This tradition, she said, continues today. " This love for education was passed on to my own daughter, who was reading everything in sight at the age of 2. My daughter, in turn, has passed on the love of reading and learning to my 12-year-old granddaughter. " In conclusion, she called for a continuing crusade to provide the best education for America 's children. " Like those before me, I have a burning desire to educate. I feel strongly that all children should be able to read at a very early age... I would like to see all young people get the greatest education they canpreferably from a UNCF school! I would actually love to see all young people stay in school until they receive their Ph.D. " The Frederick D. Patterson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the United Negro College Fund in 1944.
