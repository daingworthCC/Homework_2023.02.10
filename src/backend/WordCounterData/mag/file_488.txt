4085041 Q : I just tested positive for one of the high-risk strains of HPV. I 've been married for 10 years -- how could this happen? Did he cheat? A : I ca n't tell you how many times I get this question. It 's understandable that you might worry your husband was unfaithful, became infected with the human papillomavirus( HPV), and passed it on to you. But let me be crystal clear : That 's not necessarily the case. More than 80 percent of women will be exposed to HPV by age 50 -- and much like other viruses, it can remain dormant in your body for years. It 's entirely possible to have a negative test one year and a positive one the following year, even if you were exposed a decade ago. As your doctor has probably explained to you, carrying a high-risk strain increases your risk of cervical cancer, so be absolutely sure to get a Pap smear and HPV test annually. HPV usually clears up on its own, but if yours does not, or your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a colposcopy or biopsy. That said, simply having a high-risk strain does n't automatically mean you will get cancer. Just be vigilant and follow doctor 's orders! Q : My 10-year-old walked in on my husband and me in bed, and ever since I 've been paranoid about having sex and ca n't seem to relax! How do I get back in the mood? A : I swear that my first child seemed to know instinctively the exact moment my husband and I would decide to get busy. It can be embarrassing, but what I call " sexus interruptus " happens to almost everyone with children. You ca n't let the incident freeze up your sex life. My suggestion : Go away for the weekend sometime soon, or send the kids to Grandma 's house. That way, there is no chance of being interrupted, and you and your husband can break the sexual ice. Back in real life, try scheduling sex( as unsexy as that sounds) for the times when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put a lock on your bedroom door. Sex is important for strengthening the bond in a marriage, and pleasure is also key for your physical and emotional health. You deserve it! CASE HISTORY : MENOPAUSE AT AGE 36? So often when patients in their 30s have strange symptoms, like irregular periods, they ask me in a panic : Could it be premature menopause? The vast majority of the time, the answer is no. Premature menopause is rare and occurs in only one in 100 women in their 30s ; the average age for " the change " is 51. But I still recall one memorable patient who came to see me at age 36 because she was having trouble getting pregnant. She had just started a stressful job, was n't sleeping enough, and had shed 30 pounds, so she assumed tension and weight loss were to blame when she stopped having her period. But a blood test revealed that her levels of follicle-stimulating hormone( a substance released by your ovaries in preparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was devastated, and I referred her to a reproductive endocrinologist -- a hormone specialist. If you 're having irregular periods, do n't freak out, but you should always check in with your ob/gyn. And if you have a family history of early menopause, you should let your doctor know. Luckily, this case history has a happy ending : My patient did eventually get pregnant, with the help of a donor egg and in vitro fertilization.
