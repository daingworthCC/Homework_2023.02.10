2019741 It took a transplanted Californian to teach Hawaii 's businessmen to dress like they 're in Hawaii. <p> MIDDAY ON Bishop Street in downtown Honolulu. Businessmen, bankers and lawyers rush between lunch meetings and appointments. But to an out-of-towner something seems strangely amiss. There 's hardly a suit and tie in sight. <p> Chalk up the casual look among local influentials to Hawaii 's temperate climate and a transplanted Californian named Reyn McCullough. The preferred attire : dress slacks and a muted print Hawaiian ' shirt. More precisely, a short-sleeved pullover with button-down collar made by a family-run outfit named Reyn Spooner-Inc. <p> Such has not always been the case. Twenty-some years ago, when Jack Lord and Hawaii Five-O were in their heyday, many respectable Hawaiian businessmen still dressed in the staid old business attire of the mainland. And loud Hawaiian shirts, known locally as aloha shirts, were strictly for tourists. <p> But around that time the Hawaii state legislature created something called Aloha Friday, encouraging men to wear aloha shirts to work on Fridays.( Today 's aloha shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brightly colored print shirts were regularly made out of leftover material from women 's muumuus.) Trouble was, most of the aloha shirts on the market were more suited to the beach than the office. <p> That 's where Reyn McCullough comes in. In the 1940s and 1950s McCullough, who died seven years ago, owned a traditional men 's store on Catalina Island off the coast of Los Angeles. My father got tired of watching the Pacific-bound planes fly overhead, ' recalls Reyn 's son Timothy, 42, who now runs the business. So he decided to get on one and come out to see what was going on in Hawaii. ' <p> He liked what he saw. Statehood was imminent. And so was the introduction of jet travel. Hawaii -- soon to be just a short flight from the West Coast -- seemed to be filled with opportunities. So in 1959 McCullough packed up his wife and two kids and moved, opening up a men 's shop at the new Ala Moana shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. No one, it seemed, was making an aloha shirt dignified enough for his local customers to wear on a casual evening out. So McCullough got it into his head to design a sort of preppy all-cotton aloha shirt with button-down collar. To make the shirts, he teamed up with Ruth Spooner, a custom swimwear maker in Waikiki. <p> The shirts, which he began selling in his store in 1961, quickly caught on with local customers. Not the least of their appeal was their toned-down colors. McCullough had observed that the most authentic-looking aloha shirts were the ones the surfers wore, which had become bleached out by the sun. To achieve that effect he simply turned the brightly colored floral and calico prints inside out. <p> Gradually, as the aloha shirt phenomenon caught on among businessmen, sales of Reyn( pronounced ren) Spooner shirts began to grow. By the mid-Seventies -- McCullough had bought Ruth Spooner 's company in 1963 -- he was operating seven Reyn 's stores and wholesaling shirts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainland. Revenues for the company, which is headquartered in Waimea on the Big Island ' of Hawaii, hit $2.5 million. <p> But by 1984, when Tim McCullough took over after the sudden death of his father, Reyn Spooner shirts were starting to look a bit old-fashioned. The younger McCullough moved carefully, but decisively, to expand the business.( One sister works as a buyer for the stores ; two others are not involved in the business, and Tim 's wife, Kooksie, oversees the women 's merchandise.) <p> It 's a delicate dance, ' says Tim, to retain the virtues of a company that was created by someone else and to move forward at the same time. ' He had worked around his father since he was a kid, beginning with odd jobs in the Catalina store. After high school, he spent eight years operating a truck farm before coming back to the family business. He recognized the company 's greatest strength was the traditional ' look of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he also knew that the company was ignoring the more trend-conscious part of its customer base. <p> To attract new customers, Tim started looking at new fabrics and styles.( Reyn Spooner shirts come in five basic styles and cost between $52 and $70 each.) For starters, he expanded the number of patterns introduced every year -- ranging from florals featuring large plumeria blossoms to pastel prints of postcard scenes of Waikiki, circa 1940 -- from 12 to 75. <p> He also took the button-down coat-front model, among others, and updated it in Reyn-lon, ' a 100% rayon fabric. The material is looser, drapes well, and looks better with linen slacks and pleated pants. Explains McCullough : This gives us entree to another kind of retailer that did n't buy Reyn Spooner before. We figure we can take an old Reyn Spooner customer and trade him up to this new look. ' <p> Since taking over, Tim McCullough has more than doubled revenues, to nearly $16 million. To do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't say how much. However, he says pretax profit margins have remained steady at about 10%. Most of the company 's growth has come from expansion of the retail stores and a tenfold increase in wholesale accounts -- mainly specialty shops in Hawaii, Japan and the U.S. mainland. In addition to the wholesale business, which accounts for 50% of sales, McCullough runs ten Reyn 's retail stores in Hawaii. <p> While Reyn Spooner 's fabrics are made in the Far East, McCullough continues to make his shirts in Hawaii, at a 29,000-square-foot factory near downtown Honolulu, which employs almost 100 seamstresses. Why not lower costs by moving production offshore? For one thing, he believes an authentic aloha shirt ought to be made in Hawaii. Moreover, he adds, My goals are the same as my father 's. Our business is n't about cheap. It 's about quality.
