2028141 Section : 200 Best Small Companies Cliff Hudson revitalized a regional chain of drive-in fast-food joints. Can he take it national? <p> Sonic Corp. is but one-fifth the size of McDonald 's domestic burger business. But, unlike its larger rival, it does n't have to worry about pretending to be health-conscious or luring kids with plastic toys from the latest aniflick. A determinedly retro fast-food organization, the Oklahoma City-based chain of drive-ins still has a stubbornly high-calorie menu delivered by 1950s-style carhops on roller blades. How hard is it to screw up that formula? <p> Pretty easy, apparently. Which is why J. Clifford Hudson grimaces at the memory of taking over in 1995 as chief executive, a decade after he 'd joined as house counsel. For starters, menus differed from store to store -- Slaw Dogs served up in the Carolinas ; ice cream sundaes peddled by a renegade franchisee in Texas ; deep-fried " Pickle-Os " furtively sold in Sonic 's own backyard. Even within the same city, it was easy to find radical taste variations in Tater Tots because franchisees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started there. Drive-ins had undergone only the most superficial touch-ups since the company 's founding in 1953, and were peeling relics. Accounting? Still done manually, meaning that September 's quarterly statements from franchisees were n't available until four months later, and were prone to errors. Company pitchman Frankie Avalon -- a teen idol when Sonic was founded -- left today 's youngsters scratching their heads. Franchisees, operating 1,438 regional drive-ins then, were fuming. " It was time for the brand to grow up, " recalls Hudson, 47, slamming his **25;2750;TOOLONG fist on the table. <p> Today, it 's a different story. Sonic has n't changed its formula ; it 's just gotten better at standardizing it. Skechers-skating teens serve up a quirky variety of artery-hardening tasties like Ex-Long Cheese Coney hot dogs, Ched ' R ' Peppers and Banana Cream Pie Shakes in its 2,471 stores, mostly in the Sunbelt. For the last five years, the home office has enjoyed 17% and 28% annual average sales and profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on $330 million in sales( it ranks number 47 in the 200 Best list). Franchisees are no longer in revolt : Average unit revenues have grown 5% a year since 1997 to a current $874,000. And same-store sales have increased 16 consecutive years, up 3.1% in the fiscal third quarter ended May 31( compared with a 1.6% drop for McDonald 's). <p> Hardly gloating, Cliff Hudson ca n't forget what it took to get Sonic 's sizzle back. In 1986 he joined a group of Sonic executives that took the company private for $10 million, a combination of cash from insiders, venture funding and a loan from Heller Financial. <p> That turned out to be the easy part. Hudson, who received his law degree from Georgetown, was executing new contracts for franchisees that raised their royalty rates. He got an earful from them and the four franchisee groups on Sonic 's executive board. Not a happy constituency : More than 300 units had closed, and here was headquarters demanding a doubling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royalties. In one instance, as Hudson was negotiating a vendor deal with Coca- Cola, 500 franchisees banded together and signed with Pepsi.( He phased out that agreement later on.) Sonic 's 110 company-owned stores were losing a total of $1.5 million a year. <p> Later, Hudson was supervising Sonic 's $31 million public offering in 1991.( Most of the proceeds went to pay down bank debt.) Within two years Hudson became chief operating officer, responsible for helping the company rediscover growth. He unloaded unprofitable divisions like the equipment sales unit, and pushed for modern computer systems to expedite accounting procedures and make better purchasing and sales projections. <p> By the time he was named chief executive, Hudson hit a wall again. Franchisees were demanding new and longer license contracts a full five years before they were set to expire. Franchisees felt neglected. They were n't getting training or purchasing services, and that was driving up costs. Franchisee-owned stores were taking in an average $577,000 each, 79% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home office was horning in on their turf, sometimes opening stores just miles away. Franchisees wanted exclusive rights to build in certain markets and more decision-making power. " There was the perception that they kept a lot of secrets from franchisees, " says Bobby. J. Merritt, a partner in 140 Sonic stores. " Cliff had to prove his credibility. " <p> Hudson was willing to meet them halfway -- even though an agreement took 13 grueling months. Franchisees could have 20-year contracts, with options to renew for another decade. They could join a revamped advisory council. Master franchisees could have first crack at new markets and protection from company encroachment. <p> But in return Hudson demanded consistency in menu and vendor deals for the first time in company history. He required cooperative purchasing and advertising. And franchisees would have to pay up : Fees doubled to $30,000 and royalties moved up as high as 5% of gross revenues, depending on sales volume. Most franchisees swallowed hard. Those who stayed followed Merritt 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least it meant we were making more. " <p> At the same time, Hudson took a mop to headquarters. He brought in experienced fast-food executives, like Frank B. Young, a Wendy 's alumnus, to run the company-owned restaurants division, and Michael Shumsky, a Taco Bell veteran, to oversee operations. Andrew Ritger, a onetime Hardee 's executive, slashed costs throughout the system -- from more efficient shipping to trimming the number of Sonic 's five hamburger patty sizes down to two : regular and kid-size. By 2001, operating expenses were down to 73% of the average franchisee 's sales. <p> But instead of whacking costs in the parent company, Hudson was spending more -- expenses rose 46% to $19 million between 1995 and 1997 -- to execute Sonic 's boom. " If you 're a growth company, you need to invest in people, " he says. " Otherwise you 're going to end up killing yourself. " <p> Some of that money was going toward building a brand, at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, who sits on the board. Pattye Moore, a well-liked marketing executive in the firm, was promoted to oversee the company 's new image. And franchisees, who 'd always had to kick in as much as 3.25% of gross revenues for a local ad fund and another 0.75% for national campaigns, now saw some results. <p> Sonic hired Kansas City-based Barkley Evergreen &; Partners, responsible for successful campaigns for Cellular One and Western Auto. The company bought time on cable channels, where ads focused on a fresh, albeit odd, menu that featured cherry limeades, onion rings and sandwiches served on thick toaster bread -- all delivered to the car in under four minutes. Frankie Avalon was shown the door, in favor of young skating carhops. Last year the company spent $80 million on marketing, triple what it had spent five years earlier. <p> For the first time Sonic began to use market research and focus groups to discern customer tastes. The results : Patrons had tastes that were even weirder than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cokes and burgers with mayo and mustard. Hudson reportedly spent $6 million over two years for point-of-sales terminals that could track customer trends. When Sonic learned that ice cream sundaes accounted for as much as 30% of one Texas franchisee 's sales, the company stopped hassling him to discontinue the program and copied it for the entire chain. Typically humdrum after-dinner sales, desserts mostly, now account for 17% of Sonic 's sales, versus 2% for most other chains. And Hudson aims to up that percentage, since diners do n't penny-pinch at dessert time. " Anything you can mix with air or water will always be more profitable, " he explains. <p> Two years ago the chain completed a Jetsonsesque remodeling program that cost franchisees an average $75,000 per store. How easy was that? Hudson first had to fix up Sonic-owned stores to prove the concept, then took HQ 's results on a road show, hearing the usual complaints, but proving his point. Hudson credits the new look for boosting average sales per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good at selling instead of forcing, " notes Chuck Harrison, partner in of one of Sonic 's largest franchise groups, with 280 stores. <p> Hudson 's focus these days is beefing up morning business, which accounts for a mere 3% of revenues, against the 11% industry average. The new breakfast menu, which includes typically off-the-wall Sonic savories like a pancake-wrapped sausage and Fruit Taquitos, is already rolled out in 47% of the chain. Some stores are already seeing a 7% bounce in sales. <p> Midwesterners and New Englanders yearning for a Sonic burger will have to wait, though. There are no imminent plans to go national. Still, the coast-to-coast ads that began running two years ago on Lifetime and ESPN are likely to create demand in new markets. A few kinks still need to be worked out-as in, how to deal with regions that have real seasons. Who wants to roll down a window in bad weather? <p> Franchisees are keeping Hudson in line, fearful of saturation. One boulevard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to five Sonic restaurants. Wall Street is also mindful of the too much, too soon syndrome. At $24, Sonic 's stock is trading at 17 times expected earnings, and is down 27% from its summer high. But its five-year total annualized return of 20% still runs circles around McDonald 's, Wendy 's and Taco Bell. And considering that some 20 states still have n't experienced a pimply-faced skater serving up a SuperSonic cheeseburger and cream pie shake, expansion is an intriguing possibility.
