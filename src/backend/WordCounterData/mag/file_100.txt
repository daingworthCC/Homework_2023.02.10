2012341 The only recipe this celebrated hostess insists she 'll never change is her well-calibrated mix of comfort food, lively guests and casual dining rules. Grab a tray and serve yourself // Photographed by Jessica Craig-Martin No tie required. No attitude allowed. Simple rules, but ones that have served Nan Kempner-and her scores of invitees-for the 46 years she has been purveying Sunday dinner parties at her Park Avenue duplex. Plenty of wine and Kempner 's signature pasta carbonara are what fuel the monthly event, which is surprisingly low-key considering the international fashion-icon stature its hostess warrants.( Kempner 's first couture purchase was made at the age of 19.) " I love my Sunday spaghettis! " she says with characteristic cheerfulness. " I give my friends good wine, good food and good company, and it 's up to them to have a great time. " Forget the black-tie affairs, sixcourse meals cooked by the latest four-star chef or a controlling hostess who deliberately steers the dinner conversation, then shoos her guests out the door at 10 o'clock sharp. " Nan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's a real informality about her dinners that makes them cozy and comfortable. At her home, you know it wo n't be a stiff, formal evening. " Uncanny for a woman widely heralded as a grande dame, with her seemingly unrivaled wardrobe, reed-thin frame, throaty laugh and inimitable style. The only problem is that the label grande dame just does n't sit well with Kempner. She loathes pretension but does admit to adoring a good entrance. She recently attended the American Ballet Theatre( ABT) Spring Gala in- " yes, yes, the dress Nicole Kidman wore to the Oscars, " she admits with a shrug, referring to the red incarnation of the now-famous Jean Paul Gaultier couture gown the Academy Award-winning star wore to this year 's ceremony. Kempner is n't laid-back, per se ; she 's more like a well-dressed tornado of energy and enthusiasm. Her closet may be daunting, but her idea of entertaining is gloriously relaxed. Carolina Herrera, a Sunday spaghetti regular for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! " enjoys going to Kempner 's because " everything at her house is perfect : She puts everyone at ease, looks effortless, the food is the best and the mix of people is great! " WHAT TO WEAR Break out the five-inch stilettos for this type of party, because you wo n't be required to actually walk in them. Casual dinner seating on low sofas offers good opportunities for showcasing glamorous shoes. Most of the women on this night wore pants, pairing them with blazers, sweaters and fanciful wrap tops. * 1an wore Loulou de la Falaise and a necklace of semiprecious stones from Tony Duquette. * 1arolina Herrera donned a jacket and trousers from her own collection. * 1erena Boardman sported a TSE cashmere turtleneck and jeans. * 1lair McClure Husain slipped on a vintage silver brocade dress. * 1rina Dvorovenko wore a dress by Vivienne Westwood. * 1athy Horyn was turned out in Narciso Rodriguez. * 1laine Trump wore a Michael Kors suit. Case in point : At a recent Sunday dinner to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years), attendees included longtime friends Kenneth Jay Lane, Blaine Trump, Reinaldo and Carolina Herrera, Paul Wilmot and Countess Sheila de Rochambeau. There were also members of Manhattan 's younger social set, such as Serena Boardman, Blair McClure Husain and Prince Dimitri of Yugoslavia, as well as ABT principal dancers Julie Kent and Irina Dvorovenko. In Kempner 's silk-paneled dining room are two round tables set up to accommodate 24 people ; the rest get to " tray it " in the living room. The hostess herself prefers the unstructured dining option, but before she carries her rattan tray into the living room, she surveys the tables. She believes in open seating but insists on one thing : " Boy, girl, boy, girl " ordering is a must. " Hah! Look at that... boy, boy, boy, " she murmers. " Oh, well, tant pis! " she says, throwing her hands up in mild desperation. " Tant pis! " repeats Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the smoked-salmon galette she contributed to the evening, with the help of chef Bernardo Barrasso. He is stepping in for his wife, Sylvina, who 's been Kempner 's chef for 40 years but is currently on vacation. " I love to eat! " enthuses Kempner. " But I like simple food. I like to know what I 'm eating. " " Nan 's parties are so great, because she has the best time at them, " says jewelry designer Kenneth Jay Lane, a frequent visitor. " It 's easy, " responds Kempner. " I 've been doing this for so many years, I should be good at it by now! " Her home, which was decorated 46 years ago by the late interior designer Michael Taylor, is conducive to entertaining. With a heyday in the ' ' 60s and ' ' 70s, Taylor was responsible for decorating the San Francisco home of Kempner 's mother. Nan 's living room, with its tonal shades of beige, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sofas, is chic and intimate-perhaps too much so for her mother 's taste. When the room was first completed, she declared, " It looks like a bordello! " Nonetheless, says Kempner, " Decorators have come from all over the world to look at it, " adding that not much has changed except for the stenciled walls in the library, a room highlighted by two Magritte paintings and a Picasso. Asked if she follows any preparty rituals, Kempner just laughs. " I take a bath and get dressed. I change clothes for dinner every night, even when it 's just my husband, Tom, and me, " she admits. " For dinner parties, I wear at-homey clothes-anything from jeans to a negligee. I also have what my mother would call a lot of " hostess " dresses. " Tonight 's look consists of flowing lilac silk jacquard pants and a chartreuse silk jacquard top by designer and Yves Saint Laurent muse Loulou de la Falaise. " I think Loulou is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room, Dvorovenko is offering diet tips to Husain ; Boardman is telling Trump about Marjorie Gubelmann Raein 's Palm Beach wedding, which she just left hours earlier, disembarking from a plane just in time for dinner. But the main topic of conversation is what everyone will wear the following night to the ABT gala. These days, designers are scrambling to dress prima ballerinas as if they were red-carpet icons. Dvorovenko has pieces from Valentino and Roberta Cavalli for the next evening, and she feels pressure, knowing that someone will be disappointed.( She chooses the Cavalli but vows to wear Valentino to the next big ABT gala, at City Center on October 22.) Meanwhile, Kempner is laughing about the difficulty she had maneuvering into her Gaultier couture at the fitting. " Thank God, Sheila de Rochambeau is going to be here tomorrow night ; otherwise, I might have to go naked! " She also makes light of what others would consider an earth-shattering crisis : The week before, at the Costume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, someone stepped on the hem of her Valentino gown, causing the buttons at the back to come undone and exposing a bare bottom. Kempner only sees the humorous side to the whole incident, which is part of what makes her a supreme hostess. " Nan has a wicked sense of humor, " says Trump. " With her, you never know what she 's going to say, so you just have to hold on to your seat! She 's not afraid to let it rip. " Sounds like the recipe for a perfect night.
