2013241 How to decide when your kids need a change // THE BELY-MACPHERSON FAMILY HAD A GOOD NANNY - some would even say a great one. Sonia took the kids to the park, arranged playdates, organized crafts and, excepting the very occasional fast-food lunch, championed children 's nutrition. And because Sonia was shared with another family, costs were manageable. It was a perfect child care scenario - well, almost perfect. After a year in the nanny-share, Nathalie Bely started to notice that her eldest child, three-year-old Angus, was becoming quiet and withdrawn. " He was bored, " she says. " The nanny had her hands full with my daughter and the daughter of the other family, who were both almost two, and Angus 's interests just could n't be addressed. She was doing everything she could, but the nanny just could n't meet the needs of both the toddlers and the preschooler. " So Bely decided the time had come to move on, and enrolled her kids in a half-day preschool program near their home. Switching from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents, a prospect so dire it ranks right up there with changing jobs or even moving houses. For most families, though, a time comes when they have to leave a comfy-cozy care situation - whether it 's because of mom 's new job, a seven-year-old 's evolving social life or a tween 's burgeoning need for autonomy. On average, Canadian kids will experience two or three different child care situations before they leave elementary school, says Cheryl DeGras, co-president of the Ontario Coalition for Better Child Care. " Most parents cobble together a patchwork of services to meet their changing needs, " she says. " For the most part it 's not possible right now to find everything you need for all ages all under one roof. "( That may be changing, however ; see " One-Stop Shopping, " p. 90.) Just to be clear, we 're not talking about quality issues here. If you have concerns that your child 's caregivers are n't up to the job, you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when your child is in a program that you love or with the world 's most wonderful caregiver, there can come a time when the fit no longer works. How do you know when? Learning to read the signs can help you make the right call. " I 'd rather play outside. " When Nathalie Bely saw her overburdened care provider so busy pushing two toddlers in the baby swings that she was unable to encourage Bely 's three-year-old gymnast on the monkey bars, she knew it was time for a change. In any care arrangement, children need to be challenged, both physically and cognitively, says Laurie McNelles, director of the Mothercraft Institute for Early Development in Toronto. " Children learn best when there are some things they can do independently, some with prompting and some not at all. You really want to see that range - whether in a licensed facility or Grandma 's house. " But adequately addressing a wide range of needs is beyond the physical scope of even the best grandmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space limitations. That 's because, says DeGras, " most programs do n't have the money or infrastructure necessary to be all things to all ages. What you end up seeing are scattered facilities that seem to specialize in the age group that is predominant. " That specialization can become a straitjacket as children grow - as Ruth Hatch realized when the home care she used simply got too small for her two-year-old 's burgeoning need for physical play and socialization. " We loved our home daycare for a long time, " says the Hamilton mom. " But by the time Thomas turned two, it became apparent that there just were n't enough kids his age to keep him stimulated, and not enough room in the house for really active play. " Finding care that caters to a child 's evolving interests becomes more challenging as children enter the school years - when developmental preferences and talents really start to emerge. " Piquing a child 's interest is essential, " says McNelles. " We 're not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grows and personality emerges, we want to see individual preferences nurtured and for them to be happy too. " Keeping her two children happy was a big reason Cynthia Cormier decided to make a change in care when the family moved back to their Toronto neighbourhood after a year away. Russell, then eight, and Colette, six, had liked their school 's after-care program when they were younger. But their mom felt they were ready for a little more flexibility ; it would also help them settle back in and reconnect with friends. So she hired a sitter to pick up the kids from school and supervise them till she arrived home at suppertime. Three years later, Russell and Colette still love the arrangement, which means they can choose whether to play outside, have friends over, get a jump on homework, go visiting or spend some time on the computer. Bonus : The sitter often cooks dinner for the family. " But, Mom, I 'm too old for daycare. " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " started when her son was only 10. " I do n't want to hang out with a bunch of babies. I want to play with my friends. " The Saskatoon mom 's eldest son, Luke, craved independence, but she felt he was too young to be on his own for the two hours between school and 5:30, when she arrived home from work. What McNelles recommends for this age group is a gradual weaning from care - a step-by-step approach that reassures nervous parents as it satisfies kids hungry for independence. " Perhaps you first allow them to go to soccer practice on their own before heading over to their daycare ; then you can graduate to home alone - keeping in mind you have to make sure all the appropriate securities are in place. " It 's a compromise that worked for Pennock and her son. At age 11, instead of going straight to his school 's daycare in the morning, Luke and his younger brother went to their neighbours ' across the street. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children to school. After school they went to their grandparents ' '. By 12, Luke had his own key and his parents trusted him to make his way home on his own. " I was lucky because my job was close to home and I was able to get there by 5:30. That meant he was alone for just over an hour, " Pennock says. " We discussed ahead of time what he could do in that hour and I checked in by phone frequently - that was the compromise we could both live with. " " It 's going to cost how much? " When Laura Haggart factored the cost of her second child, Kate, into the daycare equation, quitting her job to be a full-time mom was the most viable financial option. " My eldest, Callum, had just loved his home care provider, and we would have been happy to put Kate into the program if the money had made sense. It did n't, " says the Toronto mom. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one parent deciding to stay home after the birth of a second child, " says DeGras. " The math just makes more sense that way. " In fact, says DeGras, " In my 20 years in the child care and early learning business, I can tell you that what motivates most parents to move on is money. They decide they can no longer afford to commit to their current child care arrangement. " That financial pinch may be a product of creeping costs. Since 2000, child care subsidies have been cut in most provinces. According to the anti-child-poverty organization Campaign 2000, modest-income families allocate over one-quarter of their annual earnings to child care. But sometimes that still is n't enough - especially as a family grows. For Haggart and many others, the best decision is to move on. " What about my needs? " When Mary Connelly* moved from downtown Vancouver to a small community in the BC Interior, she was delighted to find a fabulous daycare with space for her then-two-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily. All was well, with one major exception - the daycare was on the other side of town, requiring Connelly and her husband to make a time-consuming drive each day. " We have a huge value around walking as much as possible and spending as much time together as a family as possible, " says Mary. " The location of this facility not only made it impossible to walk, it also ate up so much family time. We had to drop my daughter at school in one end of town and then drive to the opposite end to deliver my son. Or we would divide and conquer with one parent going in one direction and the other going in the other. " In any family, the needs of the child are important, but the needs of the family, including the parents, matter too. " Finding work-life balance is a difficult, but necessary, parental burden, " says DeGras. " So if a facility right across the street makes life more balanced, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, finding a program close to home bought valuable family time and saved her the struggle of a commute - well worth a move. Sidebar Transition Tips You 've decided it 's time to change daycare arrangements. Now what? First, says Laurie McNelles, director of the Mothercraft Institute for Early Development, realize that the transition will likely be harder on you than your kids. Children are far more adaptable than we give them credit for, she says. Besides, " change is a good opportunity to teach a child that she is capable of new situations and challenges and that she can handle stress. " These steps can ease the change for everyone : PREPARE KIDS. " Visit the new facility ahead of time, make practice runs, even ease children in with half-days, " says McNelles. USE POSITIVE LANGUAGE. " Wo n't this be exciting? " is far more encouraging than " Now, do n't be afraid. " HOLD A CELEBRATION. " Rituals are a helpful way to mark an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school or program - and to make the child feel special, " McNelles says. INVOLVE OTHERS. Create a network of support and encouragement by asking family and friends to call or query your child about his " wonderful new daycare. " ESTABLISH HAPPY CLOSURE. You might want to create a goodbye note to leave behind for care providers and special friends. Involve your child in this process so he sees finality in a positive light. One-Stop Shopping : The Future of Daycare? Bye-bye minivan mom. The stereotype of the harried mother who lives in her car, racing from daycare to school to soccer, may see its demise - if advocates of " integrated " child care have anything to say about it. Advocates like Kerry McCuaig, communications director for Toronto First Duty, a project that delivers " early learning and care " for children from infancy to age 10 under one roof. The project, she says, was prompted by the realization that most kids are being bounced around from one care facility to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " Housing a wide range of services - from infant care to after-care in one building - offers consistency for kids and convenience for parents. " " Integrated " child care is a hot topic worldwide. In Australia, the ruling Labour Party is aiming to overhaul the current child care system in favour of " one-stop shops, " while the Scottish National Party is lobbying for the development of integrated centres in schools. That 's because finding both funds and housing has been a big stumbling block in integrated care. While schools are the ideal location - they are large enough to retrofit diaper-change tables while also allowing an eight-year-old access to a gym and a 10-year-old access to soccer practice - less than half of all child care programs are located in schools. In Canada, the First Duty Project currently operates integrated care at five Toronto sites, and McCuaig is hopeful that the program will unfold in other major cities soon.
