2029041 Viewpoint : <p> As part of his health care plan, President Clinton has proposed price controls on health insurance premiums and " global budgets " that try to limit how much people can spend on health care each year. Although the details of his plan are still sketchy, the concept is not new. <p> The Canadian health system already imposes limits on premiums and budget spending. Under Canada 's government-funded health system, established nationwide in 1971, patients shoulder little or none of the cost of their care. This predictably has escalated demands for services and thus prompted a steady tightening of government regulations to control costs. The results : physician fees are rigidly controlled and the introduction of new technology and certain services are limited.( See " Should We Adopt Canada 's Health Care System? " CR, May 1990.) To see how the Clinton plan might affect patients, therefore, it is instructive to look at what global budgets and price controls have meant for Canada. <p> In general, Canadians have little trouble seeing a general-practice or family-practice physician. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempts to control health care spending by limiting expensive medical technology. Within hospitals, physicians work under severely limited budgets. <p> Lack of Access to Technology <p> The latest available statistics comparing access to modern medical technology in the United States and Canada, based on information in Medical Economics magazine, reveal the following : On a per capita basis, the United States has 10 times as many magnetic resonance imaging( MRI) units as Canada. The United States has three times as many computerized axial tomagraphy( CAT) scanners per person. The United States also has about three times as many lithotripsy units, which destroy kidney stones and gall stones with sound waves, per person. And, per capita, the United States has about three times as many open-heart surgery units and eleven times as many cardiac catheterization units( for the treatment of heart disease). <p> Rationing Scarce Technology. Seattle, Washington( population 490,000) has more CAT scanners( used, for example, to detect brain tumors) than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. There are more MRI scanners in Washington State( population 4.6 million) than in all of Canada( population 26 million). While critics of the U.S. health care system claim the United States has too much technology, all the evidence suggests that Canada has too little-as a result of the conscious decisions of government officials. <p> Delaying New Technology. Some argue that Canada and other countries with global budgets delay the purchase of expensive technology in order to see if it works and is cost-effective. If true, the downside of this approach is that patients are denied access to potentially lifesaving treatment while government bureaucracies evaluate it. -During the 1970s, for example, lifesaving innovations were made in kidney dialysis, CAT scanning, and pacemaker technology. Yet : The rate of pacemaker implantations in the United States during the mid-1970s was almost 20 times that of Canada. CAT scanners were more than three times as available in the United States as Canada. The treatment rate of kidney patients was more than 60% greater in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no new medical technology and spends very little on research and development. By contrast, research and development spending in the United States result in innovations that benefit the United States, Canada, and the rest of the world. <p> Rationing by Waiting <p> A recent 12,000-person survey by Canada 's official statistical agency led to an estimate that 1,379,000 people( out of a total population of 26 million) are waiting for some medical service, ranging from a visit to their general practitioner to nursing home admission. Of those, more than 177,000 people are waiting for surgical procedures. These people must endure lengthy waits before meeting with a specialists and even longer waits before obtaining needed surgery. <p> The Length of Waiting. Because the demand for health care has proved insatiable, and because Canadian provincial governments severely limit hospital budgets : The average wait to see an eye specialist in Prince Edward Island is six months-and it takes another six months on the aver to be treated. On the average, it takes almost seven weeks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be treated. To see an ear, nose, and throat specialist takes a little more than two weeks in Newfoundland-but it takes another six months to be treated. <p> Note that these are averages for entire provinces. The wait for any particular patient can be much longer. For example, patients in British Columbia wait up to a year for routine procedures such as cholecystectomies, prostatectomies, hip replacements, and surgery for hemorrhoids and varicose veins. In Ontario, patients wait up to six months for a CAT scan, up to a year for eye surgery and orthopedic surgery, up to a year and four months for an MRI scan and up to two years for lithotripsy treatment. <p> On the average, it takes about five weeks to see a specialist in all 10 Canadian provinces. However, the average wait varies widely from province to province. More-over, as shown in the table below, the waiting time for actual treatment varies even more. <p> More people in Canada die of cardiovascular disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for " conventional illness " and for high-cost procedures, such as cardiac bypass surgery are separate. The result is lengthy waiting lists for such surgery, often as long as a year or more. Political pressures have prompted shortterm solutions : After a report that Newfoundland 's waiting list was a year long, the hospital performing open heart surgery received a special temporary grant to deal with the waiting list. After a public outcry over the six-month waiting list, British Columbia contracted with Washington state hospitals to perform some 200 cardiac operations in 1989. <p> It is estimated that 5% of heart patients inquire about surgery outside Canada and 1.5% actually have their heart surgery performed outside the country. <p> <p> Effects on Patient 's Health. The average amount of time patients wait for surgery of all kinds appears to be about the same as in 1967, the year before Canada began implementing national health insurance. However, the makeup of the waiting list is different. More people are waiting, and those waiting are sicker. Recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting describe themselves as " in pain. " Others are risking their lives. In British Columbia, for example : Whereas only 7% of the patients waiting in 1967 were classified as urgent, 24% were classified as urgent in 1988. Whereas 0.6% of the population was on the waiting list in 1967, 1.1%-almost double the fraction of the population-was on the waiting list in 1992. <p> On the surface, the number of people waiting may seem small relative to the total population. However, considering that only 16% of the population enters a hospital each year in developed countries and that only about 4% require most of the serious( and expensive) procedures, these numbers are quite high. They imply that one out of every four British Columbians needing expensive medical technology is unable to get it promptly. <p> How Global Budgets Cause Rationing. The evidence shows that the severity of rationing is directly related to the stinginess of a province 's global budget. Specifically, there is a close correlation between waiting times and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example : Provinces that spend $1,500 or more per capita on health care have shorter waiting times. Ontario, the province with the shortest waiting times of all, spent $313.70 per capita more on health care than any other province in 1991, the latest year for which data are available. <p> Americans Cut in Line. The Canadian government has proclaimed health care to be a basic human " right. " Yet the right is far from guaranteed. Not only do Canadians have no enforceable right to any particular medical service, they do n't even have a right to a place in line when health care is rationed. The 100th person waiting for heart surgery is not " entitled " to the one hundredth surgery, for example. Other patients jump the queue for any number of reasons. Among the patients who jump the queue are Americans who pay out-of-pocket for care. U.S. patients add to hospital revenues, so hospital administrators value them. Since Canadians can not legally pay for care at a national health insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. In this sense, Americans have a greater right to health care in Canada than do Canadians. <p> Global Budgets Favor Rich and Powerful. Most people in Canada and other countries that ration health care through global budgets believe that the wealthy, the powerful, and the sophisticated move to the head of the rationing lines. Because government officials have little interest in verifying these facts, few formal studies exist. However, the evidence that does exist supports the charge. A recent analysis of surgical waiting lists in British Columbia concluded that " nearly 80% of queue jumping is not on the basis of emergency but on the basis of physician/surgeon preferences, requests from senior Ministry of Health officials, and sometimes from members of the legislature. " Members of Parliament and 4,364 high-ranking federal bureaucrats can avoid waiting lists because they have access to the National Defense Medical Center. In 1990, the Canadian Auditor General reported that 61% of the center 's inpatient days were for nonmilitary patients. <p> Even Animals Get Faster Service. In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queue in some provinces. Ordinary people, other than those designated as emergencies, can not get a CAT scan quickly at any price because they are not allowed to pay for it. However, in an 18-month period, York Central Hospital in a Toronto Suburb did more that 70 CAT scans on animals suspected of having such problems as tumors. The tests were done at night and the charge was $300 each. <p> As the waiting lines grow for virtually every type of treatment in every Canadian province, America serves as Canada 's safety valve. In increasing numbers, Canadians cross the U.S. border to get care they can not get at home. In 1990, the Ontario Health Insurance Plan paid about $214 million to U.S. doctors and hospitalsup 45% from the previous year.( Because of large budgetary deficits, Ontario no longer covers residents who take advantage of U.S. health care services, except in special circumstances, such as for procedures not done in Canada.) This year, the Canada-America Health Care Corp., @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy providing for access to care in the United States if they had to wait 45 days or longer for care in Canada. <p> Deteriorating Quality of Care Americans have been told that the quality of care in Canada has not suffered because of Canada 's system of global budgets and health care rationing. Yet there are increasing reports by doctors and the news media of patient deaths and near-deaths, precisely because the government limits technology and causes health care rationing. Here is one doctor 's report of what conditions are like in Quebec : <p> " In my academic practice at a teaching neurologic hospital in Montreal, the wait for the treatment of ' minor ' medical problems( e.g. carpal tunnel syndrome) could be half a year or longer. What I considered essential services were unavailable. I recall losing an argument with the radiologist on call over whether a patient with a new stroke should have a CT scan at 5:05 p.m. ; he judged that the situation was not an emergency serious enough to warrant performing the procedure after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global budgets often point to the lower level of health care spending in other countries as " proof " of efficient management. Nothing could be further from the truth. By and large, countries that have slowed the growth of health care spending have done so by denying services, not by using resources efficiently. <p> How much does it cost a hospital to perform an appendectomy? Outside the United States, it is doubtful that any public hospital knows. Nor do government-run hospitals typically keep records that would allow anyone else to find out. In organizational skills and managerial efficiency, Canadian hospitals are far behind hospitals run by Hospital Corporation of America, Humana, or American Medical International. In fact, Canadian hospitals in several provinces have called in management groups from the United States either to retrieve them from financial difficulty or to improve their financial performance generally. <p> While 177,000 wait for surgery in Canada, at any point in time one in five hospital beds is empty. Moreover, about 25% of all acute-care beds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " ' hotel " services of the hospital, which are less draining to limited hospital budgets. <p> The U.S. health care system is often criticized as wasteful because many procedures are " unnecessary. " One source of evidence for unnecessary medical care is a series of studies that show wide variations in the rate of treatment among different U.S. communities, with no apparent justification. One might suppose that in countries where health care is rationed and many medical needs are unmet, doctors would tend to provide only necessary care. That is not the case. Treatment rates in Canada also vary considerably. For example : There is a four-to-one difference among Canadian counties in the rate of cesarean sections. There is a four-to-one difference in rates of tonsillectomy and hysterectomy and a two-to-one difference in the rates of mastectomy, prostatectomy, and cholecystectomy. <p> The characteristics described in this article are not accidental by-products of global budgets and price controls. They are the natural and inevitable consequences of government 's responding to increases in demand for health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration 's health care proposal has ostensibly rejected a Canadian version of nationalized health care, it has adopted the key deficiency of the Canadian system. Capping the supply of care through budget and premium limitations, as in the Canadian system, will lead to lower costs only to the extent that they lead to shortages of technology, waiting for treatment, and reduced response to the health care needs of Americans. <p> GRAPHS( 2) : Waiting Times in Canada( JOANN MIYAKE AND MICHAEL WALKER, " WAITING YOUR TURN : HOSPITAL WAITING LISTS IN CANADA, THIRD EDITION, " FRASER FORUM, MAY 1993) <p> By Michael Walker and John C. Goodman <p> <p> Mr. Walker is executive director of The Fraser Institute, a Vancouver, Canada-based organization specializing in health care issues <p> Mr. Goodman is president of the National Center for Policy Analysis( NCPA) in Dallas. <p> COST CONTROL FAILURE <p> Despite global budgets, rationing by waiting and other strategies, Canada has not been any more successful in controlling costs than has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent $2,868 per person on health care, whereas Canada spent only $1,915( in U.S. dollars). Some people argue that if the United States adopted Canada 's health care system, it could cut health care spending by 25%. However, over the 20 years from 1967 to 1987, real increases in health me spending per capita were virtually the same in both countries.( The increase as 4.38% in the United States, 4.58% in Canada.) <p> Not only has Canada been no more successful than the United States in controlling increases in spending but, until recently, it has been less successful. Recent financial successes in Canada have been achieved largely by denying and delaying care. <p> Comparing United States and Canadian health care spending presents problems because of differences in how money is spent and how it is tabulated. In order to avoid these problems, one study measured international health care spending excluding costs of administration, hospital construction, and research and development. Using this more precise measure, the study found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health care than Canada-but the difference is smaller( 10.2% vs. 8.4%.) During the 1980s, the real growth rate for health care spending was 85% higher in Canada than in the United States. In per capita terms, Canadian costs had a real growth rate of 163% of the U.S. rate. <p>
