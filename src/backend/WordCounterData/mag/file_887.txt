5008641 <h> The Nixonian Roots of Trump 's CNN Rage <p> The president is hardly a student of history.( Or, to hear Michael Cohen tell it, much of a student at all.) But he might want to consider how Nixon 's attempt to quash a corporate merger led him to face impeachment. <p> As we 've all discovered, Donald Trump is not really up on his American history. Apparently, he never was much of a student, which is probably why he was so desperate to have his former fixer Michael Cohen threaten his former academic institutions, plus the College Board, into never publicly releasing his grades and test scores. <p> It 's too bad, really, that Trump operates in his ahistorical vacuum chamber. Because if he had any inkling of the events from a half-century ago, during the ignominious presidential reign of Richard Nixon, he would probably have thought better of ordering Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs president who became Trump 's first director of the National Economic Council, and John Kelly, his then-chief of staff, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between AT&amp;T and Time Warner. As The New Yorker 's Jane Mayer recently reported, Trump called Cohn and Kelly into the Oval Office in late summer 2017, turned to Kelly and said, " I 've been telling Cohn to get this lawsuit filed and nothing 's happened! I 've mentioned it fifty times. And nothing 's happened. I want to make sure it 's filed. I want that deal blocked! " Cohn, at least, had the good judgment to know that was a big mistake. " Do n't you fucking dare call the Justice Department, " he reportedly said to Kelly on the way out of the Oval. " We are not going to do business that way. " <p> Actually, Cohn was wrong ; that is how Trump does business. In November 2017, the Justice Department filed a suit to block the AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger -- a suit it eventually lost at the district level, and then again at the appellate level. Trump 's motivation for wanting to block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him and wanted to make life difficult for Time Warner, its parent company. In his way, he also wanted to help his friend Rupert Murdoch, the owner of the Fox Broadcasting Company -- a.k.a. Trump TV -- by trying to thwart a competitor 's strategic agenda. Meanwhile, Trump did n't make a peep when Murdoch sold 21st Century Fox, a $71 billion deal, to Disney -- in fact he offered his congratulations to Murdoch. Trump 's F.C.C. also blocked Sinclair Broadcast Group 's proposed merger with Tribune Media, a deal that would have threatened the primacy of Murdoch 's Fox Broadcasting -- the business the family is keeping after the sale of its Hollywood assets to Disney -- in the **25;18270;TOOLONG market. <p> Interestingly, many of Trump 's bizarre machinations in the AT&amp;T-Time Warner deal were foreshadowed a half-century earlier by Nixon and his interjection into ITT 's proposed $1.5 billion acquisition of the Hartford Fire Insurance Company, at the time the largest corporate merger in American history. Like AT&amp;T, ITT was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International Telephone &amp; Telegraph, it would eventually oversee a portfolio of manufacturing, service, and financial businesses. Richard McLaren, the head of the Justice Department 's anti-trust division in the nascent Nixon administration, was determined to thwart ITT 's ambitions. He decided to take a stand against ITT 's proposed acquisition of the Hartford, as it was known, along with two others. <p> Despite McLaren 's clear objective to slow the growth of conglomerates, ITT decided to buy the Hartford, and signed a merger agreement on April 9, 1969. On June 23, the D.O.J. said it would oppose the deal. On November 10, ITT closed the acquisition anyway. In May 1970, the Justice Department reiterated its intention to sue ITT to unwind the deal -- in much the same way that Trump wanted his Justice Department to block AT&amp;T 's acquisition of Time Warner -- kicking off more than a year of furtive and private negotiations between Harold Geneen, the ITT C.E.O., and John Mitchell, the attorney general, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's financial adviser at Lazard, and Richard Kleindienst, the deputy attorney general and McLaren 's boss, on the other. Kleindienst had been put in charge of the ITT matter after Mitchell supposedly recused himself because his former law firm had done business with ITT.( Of course, Mitchell did not really recuse himself.) <p> Advertisement <p> Nixon, however, wanted ITT to be able to keep the Hartford, in large part because Geneen was his friend and loyal supporter, and also because ITT had secretly contributed $400,000 to his re-election campaign -- a gargantuan sum at the time -- to convince the Republican Party to locate the 1972 national convention in San Diego.( Once the payoff became public, the convention was moved to Miami.) Nixon did n't want McLaren blocking the merger. In no uncertain terms, Nixon conveyed that message to Kleindienst in an April 19, 1971 phone call. After some pleasantries and Nixon 's acknowledgement to Kleindienst that he understood that Kleindienst was nominally in charge of the ITT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trumpian fashion.( Damn tapes.) <p> Nixon : I want something clearly understood, and, if it is not understood, McLaren 's ass is to be out within one hour. The IT&amp;T thing -- stay the hell out of it. Is that clear? That 's an order. <p> Kleindienst : Well, you mean the order is to -- <p> Nixon : The order is to leave the goddamned thing alone. Now, I 've said this, Dick, a number of times, and you fellows apparently do n't get the message over there. I do not want McLaren to run around prosecuting people, raising hell about conglomerates, stirring things up at this point. Now you keep him the hell out of that. Is that clear? <p> Kleindienst : Well, Mr. President -- <p> Nixon : Or either he resigns. I 'd rather have him out anyway. I do n't like the son of a bitch. <p> Of course, Kleindienst could not let Rohatyn( or anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to unwind ITT 's acquisition of the Hartford. The fiction was allowed to continue for years. The D.O.J. sued ITT to try to force a divestiture, but agreed ultimately to settle for ITT selling a few other businesses instead. It was allowed to keep the Hartford. <p> No one would ever have known about Nixon 's intervention but for the enterprising journalism of one Brit Hume, who once worked for the syndicated columnist Jack Anderson, the Jane Mayer of his day. Hume and Anderson had gotten wind of the news of ITT 's $400,000 contribution, and together began to put the pieces together about how Nixon seemed to have intervened with the Justice Department on ITT 's behalf. Hume, ironically, is now a Fox News bigwig. <p> It was a total mess, needless to say, and the curtain-raiser on the Watergate scandal that followed. In the end, Nixon booted McLaren and made him a federal judge in four hours ' time -- a process that usually takes months, if not years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general, after Mitchell agreed to run Nixon 's re-election campaign. But Kleindienst perjured himself during his confirmation hearing about the role Nixon played in allowing ITT to keep the Hartford, and ended up resigning on April 30, 1973, after less than a year in the job. He pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor of lying to Congress and avoided jail time. But he was the first of a parade of Nixon administration officials to plead guilty in the unfolding Watergate scandal. <p> It is not crazy to see the thread that connected ITT 's acquisition of the Hartford, and the ensuing fight for anti-trust approval, to the Watergate scandal and to Nixon 's resignation and the corresponding loss of confidence in the institutions of American government. The blueprint for Nixon 's Watergate cover-up can easily be seen in the lies that Mitchell and Kleindienst uttered before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and in the clandestine, secretly taped conversations of Nixon and his top White House aides about what to do if the shit hit the fan and Nixon 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, as it eventually did. <p> Advertisement <p> Given the eerie similarities generally between Nixon and Trump, and in this instance specifically, this little nugget of forgotten history might be worth Trump reviewing. Perhaps Brit Hume, now a senior political analyst for Fox News, could work up a special report about Nixon and ITT. We know Trump would be watching.
