2026041 From VERMEER to VUILLARD <p> While offering viewers privileged glimpses of the artist at work, the subject of the studio has often led artists to reflect on the essential processes and purposes of art. <p> The tradition of depicting the artist 's workplace has ancient beginnings. Examples can be found in Egyptian tomb art, Greek vase paintings, medieval manuscripts, and bas-relief. However, the modem conception of the studio as subject -- a genre that reveals elements of the physical interior of the studio while suggesting the psychological interior of the artist -- traces its roots to the Italian Renaissance, when the studio as we know it came into existence. <p> In the earlier bottega( " workshop "), a bustling, semipublic commercial space, the master was simultaneously engaged in creating, teaching, and trading. The Renaissance changed this by redefining the artist 's role. His most valued products were no longer merely beautiful objects, but symbolic representations of ideas : thoughts made visible. <p> Hidden from the workaday world, the studio gained a mystique that the bottega had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its vital significance( as well as its physical form), the studio reflected its owner 's essential being and creative ability. Depicting his or her studio became the artist 's invitation to the viewer to enter a privileged sanctuary. For many artists, it offered a means of expressing their most deeply held beliefs about the nature of their calling. <p> In 1666, Dutch artist Jan Vermeer created The Allegory of Painting( also known as The Painter and His Model as Clio), a prototype of this invitation style rendering of an artist 's studio. Vermeer 's painting depicts an elegantly furnished interior where an artist, seen from the back, sits at an easel painting a female model. To reveal this scene, Vermeer has pulled aside a drapery. Its heavy folds produce a deep chiaroscuro on the left side of the painting, rendering the weight and richness of the fabric nearly palpable. <p> This curtain defines a boundary between inside and outside space ; the viewer can see into the studio but stands outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an announcement that the tableau beyond it is a stage set or a visual narrative -- indeed, it 's an allegory of painting. The model, they would assume, represents Clio, the Muse of History, whose attributes are the laurel crown of Fame, the trumpet, and a volume of Thucydides, the early Greek historian. A quick interpretation of the allegory 's message is that artists can win fame and fortune( suggested by the studio 's sumptuous furnishings) by taking their inspiration from history. Such a reading of the painting is in keeping with the established art theory of the time. <p> Yet the amused expression on the young lady 's face seems to undermine this official interpretation. She is, of course, not the Muse of History, but an artist 's model costumed in a slightly outlandish getup. Vermeer 's artist is transforming her into a fictitious character for the edification of his viewers ; but by emphasizing the model 's humanity, Vermeer calls attention to the distinction between artistic illusions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning of this great painting goes far beyond the didacticism of 17th-century art theory to encompass the essentially alchemical process by which the artist transforms the local and specific into the timeless and universal, a process that surpasses rigid aesthetic categories. Vermeer, after all, did n't achieve enduring fame by painting historical spectacles, but by his handling of light, which infuses his commonplace subjects with a sense of wonder. <p> Whereas Vermeer subtly questioned aesthetic hierarchies, 200 years later, French artist Gustave Courbet aggressively challenged them in L'Atelier. Conceived on the scale of monumental public art -- 12 ' x 20 ' -Courbet 's self-aggrandizing depiction of his Paris atelier makes the modern artist( Courbet himself) the hero in the sort of drama previously reserved for religious and historical subjects. Crowded with more than 30 figures of humans and animals, L'Atelier resembles a scene from grand opera, its theatricality emphasized by the symmetrical arrangement of figures on either side of the central group. <p> Courbet shows himself wielding a brush ostentatiously before a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a little boy look on in admiration. The groups on the right and the left represent opposing social and cultural forces, or " the people who thrive on life and those who thrive on death ; it is society at its best, its worst, and its average, " as the artist said. The painting 's meaning remains obscure, but Courbet may have been trying to suggest that life and society are appropriate subject matter for the artist. This notion was radical at a time when many conservative critics still urged painters to stick to tried-and-true historical and mythological themes. <p> Courbet 's realism influenced a younger generation of French naturalist painters, including Frederic Bazille, who depicted himself in his Parisian studio in 1870. In The Painter 's Atelier ; 9 Rue de la Condamine, six figures are arranged in casual poses around the high-ceilinged room. Bazille, the tall artist holding a palette, seems to have just stopped work and is discussing the painting on the easel with his friends Claude Monet and Auguste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far left, talking to the man on the stairs, and another man plays the piano in the comer. The large, expensively framed works on the walls suggest that this studio is a place of serious artistic enterprise. Yet it 's also a gathering place for male socializing, critical discussions, and music. <p> Bazille has dropped Courbet 's obvious theatricality, yet his naturalism is carefully calculated, and his studio is as much a stage as Courbet 's or Vermeer 's. The side walls splay outward, creating a wide, unusually deep foreground -- roughly, the spatial characteristics of a theater stage. We have to imagine the proscenium and its curtain, raised to reveal this scene of artistic camaraderie. But the red and green armchair substitutes for a curtain, defining the field of dramatic action and separating the viewer from those inside it. <p> Ultimately, Bazille 's rendering suggests a closed, conspiratorial group of artists who find their main support in common interests and who are n't especially welcoming to outsiders. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bazille, however, was killed in the Franco-Prussian War only a few months after he painted this work. <p> The spartan look of Bazille 's studio was probably typical of 19th-century ateliers, especially those of younger artists who were not yet established or financially secure, but it was not the ideal. For successful mainstream artists and those who wanted to join their ranks, an elaborately decorated studio was considered necessary to convey an appropriately dignified atmosphere. The exotic bric-a-brac that went into these showplaces produced an aesthetic totality composed of expressive colors, rich textures, deep shadows, and brilliant highlights. Because these were the favorite formal qualities of 19th-century Academic painting, a studio decorated in such a fashion was both an advertisement of good taste and a well-stocked warehouse of potential subject matter. <p> The decorated studio found its American proponent in William Merritt Chase. In 1878, shortly after returning from Europe, Chase occupied Albert Bierstadt 's former studio in the 10th Street Studios building in New York City, and over the next two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of the decorated studio in the United States. <p> Chase 's studio was divided into two parts : a large, semipublic room( formerly the building 's exhibition hall), where the artist received guests and held parties and musical entertainments ; and a more intimate inner studio, reserved for family, close friends, and students, where Chase did much of his painting and teaching. His painting The Inner Studio, 10th Street reveals the functional distinction between the two. Most of the painting is taken up by an impressive array of objects in the large, outer studio, but through a doorway on the left -- again, a curtain is drawn aside -- we catch a glimpse of an artist working at her easel. Chase clearly delighted in painting the showy display, but he also suggested that the ultimate importance of the studio lay in the dedicated creation taking place in the background. <p> Chase closed his 10th street studio in 1895, by which time the decorated studio was becoming passe. Around 1912 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's studio done in the new fashion, remarked that " the rooms seemed to be stricken with poverty and so bare as to seem untenanted : " The studio 's owner, noting Davis ' surprise, said, " I am afraid you are one of those people who like studios filled with tapestries and armor and palms and huge, hideous chests of carved wood.... We believe in lines and subdued colors and broad, bare surfaces. " <p> The broad, bare surfaces of 20th-century studios reflected the revolutionary aesthetic of modernism, which, seeking inspiration from the present, stripped art of all references to the past. The historical props that so enchanted Chase were swept out and a bracing plainness, as clean and well-lit as a scientific laboratory, took its place. <p> Henri Matisse 's The Studio, Quai St. Michel expresses the modernist view at its most uncompromising. Matisse 's search for " essences, " as he called them, is violently reductive : Shapes are rigorously geometric, with straight lines and rectangles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nude, the plate on the table, and the arch of the bridge seen through the studio window. Still, some casual touches breathe life into this cold realm of design. The artist 's makeshift easel, an old chair with a canvas propped on it, and the painter 's chair facing it lend the room a feeling of humanity. <p> There 's also a vestige of a curtain in the elongated brown triangle and rectangle along the picture 's right edge. Derived from the folds of the studio 's window drapery, these shapes define the picture plane, giving a visual cue to the illusion of shallow space in the painting. Thus Matisse 's studio, too, can be viewed as a stage on which the drama of artistic creation has been momentarily interrupted. Still holding her pose, the odalisque on the bed seems to be awaiting the artist 's imminent return. <p> Modernism 's puritanical zeal waned after 1920, leaving its revolution incomplete. Just as most 19th-century artists ' studios failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chase, most 20th-century artists ' studios failed to attain the stripped-down elegance of the modernist ideal. In Edouard Vuillard 's Study for the Portrait of Bonnard, the painter 's studio seems to have been hastily improvised, and its working conditions are far from perfect. Though Pierre Bonnard often worked in rented hotel rooms, this is his studio at Le Cannet, in Provence. <p> Vuillard places Bonnard 's lanky figure dead center, dividing the painting in two -- the same compositional scheme used by Courbet in L'Atelier. Like Courbet, Bonnard is working on a landscape, though he lacks an easel because it was his custom to tack his canvases, unstretched, to the wall. The landscape 's golden yellows outshine the pale light coming from an unseen window. Dominated by the landscape, the left side of the painting glows with energy, purpose, and concentration. The alert, expectant profile of Bonnard 's dachshund mirrors that of his master, who stands transfixed, lost in contemplation of his next move. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a clutter of objects strewn seemingly at random. Their arrangement results not from an exercise of taste, as would have been the case in Chase 's studio, but from the tidal forces of utility and carelessness. Vuillard 's painting beautifully expresses the shifting balance between order and chaos, a balance dictated by the competing demands of every artist 's daily life. <p> Vuillard 's portrait of Bonnard at work demonstrates that the precious victories in the struggle to make art depend, in large measure, on the ability of artists to enchant themselves, to put irrelevant distractions behind them. Often, this artistic self-enchantment takes place in studios like Bonnard 's, improvised in rooms that may revert at other times to bedrooms, children 's playrooms, or basements. In the final analysis, the studio is a magical space that is called into being from within. It is defined not by its furnishings or its lack of them but by the intensity of the artist 's vision in the moments of creation. <p> Jan Vermeer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Clio, 1665-1666, oil, 47 x 39.
