4147441 Section : Here 's How The newest generation of sealed Liquid coolers makes less noise, takes up less space, and is easier to install than traditional air coolers. Here 's how to install one yourself. # TABLE # TABLE # WANT TO KICK your PC 's performance up a few notches? Try this : A good liquid cooling system moves heat from the CPU more efficiently than air cooling, and can run much more quietly. # Many enthusiasts have used liquid cooling for years. In the past, though, installing such a system -- aka plumbing -- was not for the faint of heart. High-end liquid cooling involved connecting tubing, ensuring that the tubing was properly sealed, and then filling up the reservoir with coolant. If you did n't achieve a proper seal, firing up the liquid cooler could lead to disaster. # High-end customized cooling systems are still the only way to go if you want to cool all aspects of your PC, including graphics cards and even hard drives. But if you just want a better CPU cooler, new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coolers. # Why Upgrade? # If you 're content to run with the stock Intel or AMD CPU cooler that ships with your processor, that 's fine -- unless your CPU does n't have a cooler at all. In that case, you might wish to plunk down $20 or so for a standard fan/heat-sink combo, but the CPU will run a little hotter and the overall noise levels will be higher. # For a little more money( $40 to $100), you could pick up a high-end air cooler. Most are quieter than a standard heat-sink unit, but they tend to be much bulkier as well. And although they can be very efficient at cooling your CPU, some actually restrict airflow -- particularly inside smaller midsize-tower cases -- and as a result key components such as graphics cards, drives, and even motherboard components may run hotter. # Cue the sealed liquid coolers. These coolers contain a tiny pump integrated into the heat-sink module. Factory-sealed tubes connect the heat-sink/pump module to a radiator, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. A modest amount of this coolant circulates via the pump between the radiator and the heat sink. The unit 's tubing is both flexible and well constructed ; it takes considerable effort to break the tubing and spill the coolant. # TABLE # TABLE # TABLE # The radiators are designed to fit into a standard fan mount( usually 120mm) on most PC cases. Fans attached to the coolers remove waste heat from the radiator. Some higher-end variants may support dual fans, improving airflow and cooling efficiency but also increasing system noise. # Most models in the new generation of liquid cooling systems for CPUs are fairly simple to install. In fact, they are often less difficult to install than high-end, fan-based CPU coolers, since they 're more compact and fit into a wider range of cases. The most common issues that arise during installation involve the case-mounted radiator module, rather than the heat sink itself. # Before You Install a Sealed Liquid Cooler # Check your specs : Confirm that your system 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A 120mm fan mount on the case to accommodate a radiator : Usually, this mount will be in the rear, but some smaller cases may put it on top. Given the sealed tubing 's length, installing the radiator in the front is almost impossible. Some cases have fan mounts on the side panel, but placing the radiator there would make panel removal difficult at best. #( Note : The focus here is on installing an Antec Khler H2O 620 cooler. For a discussion on attaching a different model -- the Corsair H60 -- that attaches to the CPU somewhat differently, see find.pcworld.com/72931.) # Space for a bracket under the motherboard : If your case does n't have a cutout in the motherboard tray for mounting the bracket, you 'll need to remove the motherboard to install the brace. # Prepare the location : You must remove a couple of components before you install the new cooling system. # First, remove the 120mm case fan( if your computer has one) from the future location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CPU heat sink. If your system has a stock Intel cooler, removing it is simple. Using a flat-bladed screwdriver, rotate the mounting latches about one-half turn counterclockwise and then pull each latch straight up until you feel it detach from the motherboard. After detaching all four latches, remove the heat sink. # A high-end air-cooled CPU heat sink may have a back plate on the motherboard to help support it. Be sure to remove that plate before installing the underside brace for the new cooler. # Now you are ready to install the liquid cooler. # Installing an Antec Khler H2O 620 # I installed the Antec Kuhler H2O 620 into a system running an Intel Core i7-960 CPU on an X58-based motherboard. Previously this machine had sported the standard Intel heat sink, and the processor constantly ran on the hot side. Although the CPU never overheated, I noticed that the fan would spin up quite noisily when the CPU was under Load. # TABLE # TABLE # TABLE # TABLE # Here are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motherboard. The Khler ships with different braces for AMD and Intel CPUs ; the Intel brace has three slots for the mounting nuts. I slipped the nuts into the slots for socket 1366. Use two slivers of double-sided sticky tape to help the brace adhere to the bottom of the motherboard. # 2. Attach the radiator to the case. The mounting screws for the radiator will run through the fan and then screw into the heat sink, sandwiching the fan between the radiator and the case. Align the fan so that air travels from inside the case to the outside ; arrows on the fan 's sides indicate the direction of air movement. # 3. Screw the retention ring into the bottom brace, so that the screws go through the heat-sink mounting holes surrounding the CPU socket. When you attach the retention ring initially, turn the screws only enough to make a firm connection ; do not screw them down tightly yet. # 4. Slip the Khler H2O 620 heat-sink pod through the retention ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tabs on the ring. Rotate the heat sink slightly, until its tabs align with the retention ring 's tabs. Then, while holding the heat sink firmly with one hand, gradually tighten the screws, alternating between them every few turns, until all four screws are firmly seated. #( If you plan to install Intel 's RTS2011LC onto a socket 2011 motherboard, you may want to hold the heat sink in place, lower the detached retention ring over the heat sink so that the tabs align, and then screw it into place, as clearance is tight.) # 5. Once the heat sink and the radiator are attached, connect the radiator-fan power connector and the heat-sink pump connector via an adapter link. Then hook up the single power connector to the heat-sink fan power header on the motherboard. The Khler H2O 620 uses only the CPU power connector. # At this point, I tested the PC 's performance. With the stock Intel cooler, idle CPU temperatures were around 55 or 56 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees Celsius, and the entire system is far quieter. # Final Thoughts # Since these units contain liquid and moving parts, you might worry about reliability, pump failures, or leakage. The Antec Khler H2O 620 offers a three-year warranty ; Corsair ups the ante with a five-year warranty on its H60. In both cases, overall reliability is highly likely to exceed the warranty period. # If the pump fails, the effect is no different from that of having a normal air-cooler fan fail : The CPU will overheat and the computer will shut down. There 's no reliable data on the frequency of coolant leakage, but I have heard of instances where coolant leaked out of the tubes and cooked the motherboard. Nevertheless, with thousands of these coolers in place, and with big names such as Intel jumping into the market, leakage is unlikely. Just make sure not to bend the tubes into unusual angles or around components that could cause tube damage. #
