2039641 Section : SCIENCE AVIATION <p> Reproducing the engine that created powered flight poses formidable technical challenges. For starters, the Wright brothers never drew up plans. <p> When the Wright Flyer rose over the sands of Kitty Hawk, it was propelled by a 4-cylinder engine nearly as astonishing as the flying machine that lifted Orville Wright into the crisp North Carolina sky. This year, as part of the nation 's yearlong centennial of flight celebration, several teams of aviation enthusiasts are attempting to recreate the whirling mechanical wonder that made that famous flight possible. Given the Wrights ' reputation for detail, the seemingly straightforward task of recreating the original engine has proved to be surprisingly difficult. While Orville and Wilbur kept careful records of their wind-tunnel and flight tests, engine builder Charlie E. Taylor took a more casual approach. The cranky, cussing mechanic who ran the Wright brothers ' Dayton, Ohio, bicycle shop, and irritated their sister Katharine with his incessant cigar smoking, did his work on the fly. It was n't carelessness. It was just the way Taylor preferred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles E. Taylor : The Wright Brothers Mechanician. " Charlie was the first aircraft mechanic in the world, " DuFour tells POPULAR MECHANICS. " One of them - Orville, Wilbur or Charlie - would sketch out the part they were talking about on a piece of scrap paper. Then, Charlie ' spiked ' these scraps on his workbench for reference in machining and assembling the engine. " As the parts were completed over the next six weeks, these scraps of paper were lost, along with the details of the engine that would revolutionize transportation. <p> Over the years, historians in the United States and England have attempted to recreate the original Wright engine plans, chiefly by reverse-engineering similar-looking models that had been built later. Orville Wright unintentionally made their task more difficult. " In 1939, Orville began to make his own drawing revisions, " says DuFour. " He and Charlie used dimensions from the third engine, loaned by Orville for display at Henry Ford 's restoration of the Wright Cycle Shop in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine was unavailable because it had been ruined on the first day of flying. A gust of wind flipped the Flyer, causing the engine mounts to snap. Because the engine was purely experimental, there had been no attempt at standardization, making few of its parts useful for later models. <p> To achieve historical accuracy, contemporary engine builders have had to turn to the mass of paperwork - some 30-plus linear feet of it - that the Wrights left behind. " We scour the letters that were written between the Wrights and their suppliers to find clues, " says Ken Hyde, Executive Director of the Wright Experience flight recreation project. Hyde and his colleagues searched the letters for helpful information, such as a reference to a specific oil type or some other material. Engineers at Ford Motor Co., which is a Wright Experience sponsor, are also completing a study of details of the engine. In the best tradition of forensic science, they are reviewing the properties of the original oils and metal particles taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bits of sludge, residue and metal chips. <p> The Ford research will supplement the finding of a 1985 study by the National Air and Space Museum( NASM), which mounted a scholarly effort to find the best set of Wright Flyer plans. NASM concluded that while the drawings that Orville and Taylor created in 1939 were the most detailed, those based on an early Wright Flyer stored in England 's Kensington Science Museum were generally more accurate. Details Differ <p> Although helpful, neither set of drawings has proved as useful as engine builders would like. " There was no engineering, " says John Nowicki, who heads the Wright Engine Project for Packer Engineering in Naperville, Ill. " If you 've seen the original plans, you know that they are actually drawings for several engines. " Nowicki 's team is building a full-size replica to power the Spirit of Glen Ellyn. Sponsored by the Wright Redux Association of Glen Ellyn, Ill., it is scheduled to fly over the lawn at the Museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will later hang on display there. Inside The Original Wright Engine <p> Steve Hay of Hay Manufacturing in Lake Geneva, Wis., has had a similar experience. He has the contract to build the engine for the Wright Experience aircraft that will fly at Kitty Hawk on Dec. 17. " The Wrights ' plans show parts from engines built in 1903, 1904 and 1905, and a 1905 experimental engine. No set of drawings will make an engine you can put together. " The engines that are now being built will come close to the previously published plans, but for practical reasons can not follow them exactly. " The inside diameter of the cylinder on the Wright plans is shown as 4 in., " says Nowicki. " This is the same as the outside diameter of the piston. " To correct this impossible specification, the Packer team will make the pistons on its engine three-thousandths of an inch smaller than the cylinders. <p> The original water-cooled, aluminum and copper alloy engine had four horizontal inline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connecting rods. One of its more interesting features was the use of cylinder liners. Iron tubes were screwed into the aluminum crankcase. Their walls were machine finished, but not honed. The Wrights depended on the wear of the pistons to lap the walls over time as the engine was broken in. Missing Parts <p> What was missing from the 1903 Taylor engine is equally significant. There was neither a fuel pump, carburetor nor oil pump. Raw gasoline dripped into the cylinders from a tank mounted on the wing strut. Because it was not expected to run for long, the engine was pre-oiled. " What we found in the oil pan residue was mostly the same type of mineral oil used in today 's engines, " says one Ford engineer. " Of course, there are none of the modern antisludge, antifoam and antirust additives. " And why should there be? Taylor built his engine so that the Wright brothers could prove that man could fly - a task they accomplished in 12 seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the story as we trace the first century of flight.
