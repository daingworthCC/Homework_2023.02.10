2006641 Four days a month the sleepy town of Rosemount, Minn., swells with passionate shoppers eager to strike a deal at HAUPT ANTIEK market // Deb Haupt has a story that starts out quite familiarly : Collector-turneddealer breaks into the business by unloading " extras " from her garage. These " cleanouts " featured good buys on vintage items mostly culled from estate sales. Deb advertised ; other dealers came to sell, too. Held tri-anually, the sales became much-anticipated events. Then, in May 2003, Deb and her husband, Greg, expanded their business into a c. 1900 three-story house, on a half acre in downtown Rosemount, Minn.. six miles from their home in Eagan. With 2,200 square feet now devoted to Haupt Antiek Market, Deb opens four days each month with a new theme and about 17 regular dealers. Says Deb, " We have something tun and different each month to make it a great experience. " Greg adds, " The work required is worth the end result. " Each dealer has a house key, and comes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitch in and work. All involved share a deep sense of trust, camaraderie, and commitment. Deb particularly loves the European buying trips and the marketing and publicity. But when it comes to visual merchandising, she passes the baton over to St. Paul-based retail stylist( and occasional dealer) Christine Hoffman( this page, middle). Christine pulls it all together, and even dabbles in catering. Deb feels lucky to have amassed the giving and talented personalities that make up this bewitching brood. Sidebar It 's opening day at Haupt Antiek. October 's theme is " Colors of Fall. " The air is crisp, the mood is charged, and there 's something good to eat.

BOTTOM RIGHT : To make the candleabra, dealer Brenda Weber combined garden wire with wine glasses and votives. " It 's an amazing group, " says Deb Haupt.
