2012041 Mom, makeup artist, Hollywood wife and Stila Cosmetics creator Jeanine Lobell shares her laid-back approach to looks. By Emily Dougherty Photograph // Jeanine Lobell 's first makeup phase was an experiment in bad taste. " It all started with teal mascara and blue eyeliner. I piled it on when I was a teen, " admits the founder of Stila Cosmetics. " Next came my mod-punk phase, with red lipstick and a severe bob, followed by my funky -- hippie phase, with heavy kohl liner. " Now, Lobell, a 30-something pixie with huge brown eyes, wears practically no makeup, even while being photographed for Bazaar or attending the Emmys with her Mr. Hollywood husband, Anthony Edwards( that nice Dr. Green from ER). " Just a bit too much makeup can make me look harsh, " says Lobell, who does her own makeup for all public appearances. " It 's not me, and I want my outside to match my inside. " If you ca n't find the perfect shade of lipstick, follow Lobell 's lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Stila cosmetics are products that I personally craved, " she says. Funny and fun, smart and pretty : The same adjectives that describe Stila makeup can be used to sum up its creator. You wo n't catch Lobell at a photo shoot without : -Peter Thomas Roth Daily Defense Moisture Cream : " The best sunscreen-it does n't leave skin greasy, white or streaky. " -Sample packs of Remede Rinseable Cold Cream and Sweep facial exfoliant( right). " I get them from the Bliss Out catalog. " -Shu Uemura eyelash curler -Evian Le Brumisateur mist -Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Cream -Kiehl 's Ultra Facial Moisturizer CHEAP SHOT Lobell buys cute head scarfs, her current trademark, at Urban Outfitters.( " You can pretend you 're Ivana Trump and buy up the place. Then when they ring it up, it 's less than a hundred bucks! ") When she ca n't keep her hair under wraps, she shapes it up with Bumble and Bumble Grooming Cream. Photograph // <p>
