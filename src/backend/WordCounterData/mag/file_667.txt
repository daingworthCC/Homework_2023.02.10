4149141 Section : CARS Bring Back the Front Quarter-Window # Before there was air conditioning, we had the quarter-window, that triangle of glass between the front windows and the windshield. Pop it open and the rear edge juts out a few inches into the car 's slipstream, grabbing a handful of air and funneling it toward the driver. Trucks retained their quarter-windows longer than cars, but by the late ' 90s aerodynamics took priority, and air conditioning became ubiquitous, rendering the quarter-window an artifact. That 's a damn shame, because these wedges of glass offer a connection to the world outside your car, a happy medium between the windows-down maelstrom and the silent fortress of climate control. The front quarter-window was an elegant solution, one predicated on a simple rule : If you 're too warm, just drive faster. #
