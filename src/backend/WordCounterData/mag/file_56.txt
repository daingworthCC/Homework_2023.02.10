2007041 The appeal of this new Greek Revival home comes from its balance and scale. Photograph Attention to detail ensures this new house is both historically accurate and visually appealing. Architect Ankie Barnes was faced with modifying a model house designed by Stephen M. Banigan.. The front door was positioned off to one side, inspired by classic rowhouses in historic cities. // The details of a well-designed house are like the lines of a fine jacket, " says architect Ankie Barnes. Although it 's not always easy to pinpoint the particular traits that make a house or an article of clothing so pleasing to the eye, Ankie believes " you just know it when you see it. " One does n't need to be an architect or even understand the theories of design to know what looks good. Traditional styles appeal to most people because the forms and details are familiar and engaging. But there 's another reason classical architecture has endured for thousands of years. The ancient Greeks and Romans designed buildings with proportion, scale, and symmetry that today still possess an unquestionable sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a human scale, which can actually make one feel more comfortable either inside a room or viewing a building from afar. For this new house in Washington, D.C., Ankie used historical models to establish the overall scale of the building, the details, and the way the elements all come together. His design for Mary Dickie and Leslie Dach combines a welcoming face to the street with a livable floor plan for an active young family. A PROPER PORTICO Historically, Greek Revival homes in the South often featured an entry porch less than the full height of the house. Today, a classic portico still serves two important functions : to clearly mark the front door and provide shelter. " A doorway should be welcoming, and the scale should not be too grand, " says Ankie. " Except for the closest of friends there 's a sense of awkward anticipation before ringing the doorbell. The architectural message should be one of open arms. " Photograph " Sidelights soften the formality of a solid front door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says architect Ankie Barnes. The pattern of the muntins adds interest from both sides. Double-hung windows are simple and proportioned. True divided lights lend an appropriate scale. " Even the size of the panes is based on human scale, " explains Ankie. " The dimension is close to the size of one 's hand and head. " For continuity, architectural details along the side and rear of the house echo the style of the front. " Even a back door deserves a few welcoming touches, " Ankie says, such as the three-pane transom at this secondary entry. Rather than ornate classical columns, simple square pillars support the portico, more in keeping with the scale of the house. " Nothing is worse than a cheap round column with bad proportions, " says the architect. // Ankie recommends a depth of 4 feet and a width of 6 feet as good minimum dimensions for a porticolarge enough for two couples to feel comfortable. " If too shallow, someone might fall backwards during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds. The scale of this portico also echoes the uncomplicated architectural elements that might have graced a modest country house in the early l9th century. Columns have been modified by builders for generations, but to capture the harmony of a classical column there are certain rules that must be followed. The column shaft should always align with the outer edges of the entablature( the horizontal beam that rests above the two pillars), and the capital trim should extend out beyond this line. Standard lumber and stock molding can be used to create pillars that are historically accurate and appropriately scaled. The one shown above was crafted of typical 4 x 4 framing with 1-inch clear trim molding ; traditional crown and other moldings were used for the base and capital. Equally important is the proportion of the entablature in relation to the house and components of the portico. Its scale must correspond with the height and width of the pillars. Do n't skimp on the details, warns Ankie, or your portico will look like it got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For sources turn to page 211.)
