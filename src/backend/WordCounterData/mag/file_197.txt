2023541 <p> Perinatal Substance Exposure can cause a wide range of serious medical complications for an infant, including withdrawal, physical and neurological deficits, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, growth retardation, cardiovascular abnormalities including hypertension and strokes, spontaneous abortion and premature delivery, and long-term developmental abnormalities. Newborns exposed to crack cocaine constitute a special health crisis of staggering proportions in many communities. <p> In order to effectively address the problems presented by prenatal substance exposure, an adequate system of medical, social, and related health care services to the substance exposed infant and its mother must exist. Without an increased focus on prevention and early intervention, the problem of substance exposed infants will continue to grow, and the nation will continue to reap the tragic harvest of this problem. With adequate services and a coordinated system of care, intrusive intervention might be avoided. 1 <p> Many advocates and experts that have examined the problems of newborns exposed to drugs in utero have called for a " new " comprehensive services delivery system that is available, accessible, includes drug abuse prevention services, prenatal care, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts contend that this " new " delivery system must provide services in a complementary and consistent manner, and that the services should be timely and family-centered. This " new " system may turn out to be an " old " system -- Public Health Nursing. <p> Public Health Nursing practice dates back to the early days of the Henry Street Settlement in New York, in 1893. It was felt then, and it is true now, that poor women and children benefit from the information, education, and personalized services provided by a neighborhood nurse. The focus of Public Health Nursing services over the past decade shifted to more vulnerable populations -- but the mission is still the same. <p> It is a dynamic discipline combining nursing and public health theory. Public Health Nurses work in the family setting promoting health and preventing disease through the nursing process : assessing a family 's strengths and weaknesses, planning a strategy to remedy unhealthy behaviors, intervening to prevent further abuse, and evaluating family outcomes. Public Health Nurses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models. These models hold promise for treating substance abusing women and their children -- but before they can be implemented, nurse training programs must be developed and treatment protocols must be established. <p> In 1989, the California Association of Public Health Nursing Directors, in collaboration with the California Conference of Public Health Nursing Directors, developed a policy paper and protocols for services to families with substance exposed infants. Two plans were designed. The first focuses on the caregiver and includes parents, relatives, or foster parents ; the second focuses on the infant from birth through thirty-six months of age. The Nursing Care Plans include the categories of assessment, action/intervention, and expectation/outcome. The new assessment and intervention protocols are used for referring problems and may include the areas of physical, developmental, psychosocial, and environmental deficiencies. Psychosocial assessment and interventions focus on parenting behavior related to attachment, capacity of caregivers to meet their own needs, physical care of the infant, supervision and discipline of the infant, and health care and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes anticipated, given a specific nursing intervention, and then measure the actual consequence exhibited by the caregiver and infant. For example, the nursing assessment reveals a wailing infant and exhausted mother. The Public Health Nurse determines that the infant is being overstimulated by the mother and the environment and, therefore, role models a " quiet " feeding and turns off the television and turns down the lights. Explanation regarding overstimulation is given. The infant is soothed, feeds calmly, and falls asleep. A telephone call to the mother the following day reveals she has continued the newly learned behavior, the infant reportedly is less irritable, and the mother states she is more rested. <p> Substance exposed infants are likely to have medical complications and special care needs. Depending on the extent of prenatal drug exposure, the age of the fetus at the time of exposure, and other health risk factors during the pregnancy, the infant may exhibit behaviors that are different from other exposed infants. Interventions that work for one infant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are guidelines to assist and enhance planning and decision-making when dealing with alcohol and other substance exposed infants and their mothers or foster families, but they are not a substitute for professional judgement. 2 <p> To help make these vital assessments, many nurses use the conceptual framework of Kathryn Barnard 's Child Health Assessment Interaction Theory. 3 Her theory views the parent and child as an interactive and adaptive system. This interactive system between the mother and her infant creates an environment with the potential to effectively support, nurture and stimulate the infant. For example, the infant sends cues to the mother about hunger and sleepiness without spoken words. Similarly, the infant responds to the mother. When the effects of drugs impede an infant 's ability to send clear cues and respond favorably to the mother, her ability to respond appropriately may be inhibited. Caretaking then, can either moderate or perpetuate earlier health or developmental difficulties. Early intervention and parenting education, here, by Public Health Nurses can prevent delays in growth and development. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Training( NCAST), research-based tools also developed by Kathryn Barnard and her colleagues at the University of Washington School of Nursing. Since 1986, the California Association of Public Health Nursing Directors has offered a thirty hour training course to Public Health Nurses in the use of NCAST. Over 800 nurses in the State of California have been trained in the use of this tool. NCAST contains four nursing assessment tools : a feeding scale, a teaching scale, a home environment scale, and a sleep activity record. NCAST focuses on maternal infant interaction and provides a structure for improving parenting skills. In addition to expanding the nurse 's skill level, the inter-rater4 reliability allows counties in California to perform joint research with several other states. This research has concentrated on the use of structured interventions and outcomes with high risk infants. Very few studies exist on perinatal substance abuse and the substance exposed infant ; these studies should provide a very rich data base for future improvements in assessment models. <p> In addition to assessment models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothers and infants. Two Public Health Nurses in Santa Clara County, in cooperation with the Drug Abuse Bureau, have been teaching prenatal classes to drug addicted pregnant mothers. The classes are taught in an effort to help these women maintain healthy, drug free pregnancies. The prenatal and postpartum classes taught by the Public Health Nurses to pregnant women under treatment for addiction include : birth control methods ; sexually transmitted diseases ; common discomforts of pregnancy ; danger signs in pregnancy ; nutrition in pregnancy ; labor and delivery ; infant care ; tour of labor and delivery rooms at a local hospital ; the effects of drugs &; alcohol on pregnancy ; comforting a substance exposed infant ; early parenting and infant care ; stresses of having a new baby and the risks of returning to drug use. Referrals from the classes are made to Public Health Nurses in the appropriate district of office who then make home visits to these women before and after they deliver their babies. PHNs provide instruction conducive to changing lifestyles by 1) goal-setting ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parenting roles. 5 <p> The class instructors have found that the addicted women under their treatment are like all mothers -- they truly want to have a healthy baby. Unfortunately, the desire for a healthy baby is complicated by a powerful addiction and overwhelming odds against recovery. The tragedy of drug abuse-characterized by chronic or periodic compulsive, uncontrolled substance use -- is a treatable disease. Support services can help these women concentrate on their recovery. Public Health Nurses can provide that support link between treatment programs and the home environment to ensure enhancement and continuity of care so that addicted women can have more positive pregnancy outcomes. 6 <p>
