4108541 Better Place 's switching stations allow electric cars to swap batteries during long trips. <p> Gal Pearl, a product manager at the Israeli-based company Better Place, disconnects his electric Renault Fluence from a charge point at his company 's parking lot in Rosh Ha'Ayin. He enters his next destination into the car 's computer- which quickly calculates that the 70 -mile journey is longer than his battery 's charge level will allow. The computer maps out a route that passes a battery switching station operated by Better Place. There, an industrial robot will quickly change the car 's battery for a fully charged one that will last the rest of the trip. <p> Better Place 's switching stations are an attempt to work around the limited battery capacity that is the biggest technological barrier to wider use of electric cars. Even the newest models can not match the range of a conventional car with a full gas tank. <p> Better Place 's solution is to build networks encompassing charge points that drivers can use to recharge while they 're parked, and switching stations they can turn to if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swap a depleted battery for a fresh one in less than four minutes, about the time it takes to fill a conventional car with gas. Recharging a car like Pearl 's at a charge point takes up to eight hours. <p> In January the company will open networks in Israel and Denmark to serve hundreds of drivers. Renault has agreed to supply 100,000 of its cars for Better Place customers in those two countries by 2015. Users sign a service contract, similar to a cell-phone subscription, under which they get access to the switching stations and Better Place retains ownership of the batteries, an arrangement that reduces the cost of buying an electric car. A third network will launch in Australia in the second half of next year. <p> 1. Each Better Place charge point is connected wirelessly to a national operations center that tracks the energy needs of all batteries in the network. The rate of charge can be varied to balance demand on the electricity grid with the need to ensure that each battery is prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points draw the most electricity during off-peak hours, soaking up excess capacity when demand is low. <p> 2. A display to the left of the speedometer, similar to a gas gauge, shows the battery 's remaining charge. The car 's computer continuously monitors the charge level and the distance to the planned destination. If the battery does n't have enough charge to make it, the driver is notified and offered a route to the most convenient switching station. Better Place 's Israeli network is designed so that one is never more than 25 miles away. <p> 3. A battery switching station looks much like a car wash. Hydraulic clamps take hold of the wheels and maneuver the vehicle into position over the underground machinery that will change the battery. Screens inside the car and on the wall of the station guide the driver. As the car approaches the station, it identifies itself over a wireless link so that the correct type of battery can be moved into place. <p> 4. Beneath the switching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1 6 batteries, one of which can be seen at the lower right in this image. To maintain their capacity, the batteries are kept cool as they are recharged. Each battery has a maximum capacity of 22 kilowatthours, yielding a driving range of approximately 1 00 miles in normal conditions. Better Place calculates that this range is sufficient for the majority of regular journeys, with the switching stations on hand for the rest. <p> 5. The underside of the car is automatically washed and dried, and then a well opens beneath the car so the battery switcher can go to work. <p> 6. A robot reaches up to release and remove the car 's battery, which sits between the rear passenger seat and the trunk That battery is lowered into a rack, where it will be recharged. The robot then lifts a fully charged replacement battery into the vacant space. After the opening closes, the clamps release the car. The entire process takes three minutes and 40 seconds.
