Familiar with Yenta 's knock, Miss Cell opens the door. " Have I got a match for you, " Yenta tells Miss Cell, and pushes Mr. Glucose inside. Together, Mr. Glucose and Miss Cell make beautiful energy. <p> That is how the body 's energy production is supposed to work. But for 11 million Americans with adult-onset( type-II) diabetes mellitus, it does n't. <p> Yenta the matchmaker ca n't find the door( the cell 's receptor) because there is n't one ; or there are n't enough matchmakers to handle all the bachelor sugar molecules ; or the would-be matchmakers are n't very good at their job. Adult-onset diabetes is the result. <p> As a person with diabetes, you probably know that you 're at risk for heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infection, blindness and slow healing. Each person reacts to diabetes in his or her own way. This means each person has to be under a doctor 's care and constantly monitored. This need can not be overstated. What 's good for your diabetic friend may be bad for you. <p> Every diabetic 's goal is to maintain his or her blood sugar( glucose) and blood fat as close to normal levels as possible. The good news is that you can virtually eliminate all symptoms of diabetes -- in other words, control it -- by carefully following the regimen you and your doctor work out. <p> Here 's how to begin. If you 're planning any changes in your current regimen, talk them over first with your doctor. <p> Start with the ADA diet. The American Diabetes Association revised its nutritional guidelines in 1986. Although knowledge of dietary needs is continually expanding, these guidelines are based on the current consensus of medical experts. " Each person 's diet should be tailored to fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franz, M.S., R.D., vice president of nutrition at the International Diabetes Center in Minneapolis. The ADA diet includes the following principles : Load up on carbohydrates. The ADA recommends that a type-II diabetes diet can include up to 50 to 60 percent of calories from carbohydrates. " Generally, the recommendation will be somewhere around 50 percent, " Franz says. This means that half or more of your diet should consist of cereals, grains, breads, pasta, beans, peas, fruits and vegetables.( Each gram of carbohydrate equals four calories.) Go easy on protein. The American Diabetes Association says protein should amount to only about 12 to 20 percent of your daily calorie intake. Usually this means going easy on foods like meat and milk.( Each gram of protein equals four calories.) Trim the fats. The ADA wants you to cut a lot of fat out of your diet budget. Calories from fat should account for no more than 30 percent of your calories.( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well within this guideline.) <p> Every chance you get, replace artery-clogging saturated fat( predominant in butter, non-lean meats and high-fat dairy products) with polyunsaturated or, better yet, monounsaturated fat, or with complex carbohydrates, Franz says. Monounsaturated fats are prevalent in olive oil and canola oil.( Each gram of fat equals nine calories.) <p> Eat food with fiber. Natural fiber in food has been found to have a host of beneficial effects for everyone. That goes double for people with diabetes. The ADA advises you to gradually head for 40 grams of dietary fiber a day( or 25 grams per 1,000 calories for those on low-calorie diets). Whole-wheat products, barley, oats, legumes, vegetables and fruits are the best sources of fiber and essential nutrients. One possible benefit fiber provides diabetics is lower cholesterol levels. " The water-soluble fibers found in legumes, oats, barley and fruit, when eaten in a low-fat diet, have been shown to lower blood-fat levels, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gastrointestinal tract, " they may also cause the energy( sugar) in food to be absorbed at a slower rate, giving your insulin a chance to keep your blood sugar on a more even keel. <p> Fiber also helps keep you from feeling hungry. " I think one of the main benefits of fiber is that it adds bulk to the diet, " Franz says. " For type-II people who are trying to control their weight and so are on restricted calories, bulk lets people feel fuller. " <p> Besides giving you that pleasantly satiated feeling, fiber foods are good for you. " They 're often high in important vitamins and minerals, " Franz says. <p> Cut your cholesterol intake. The ADA recommendation is that you should eat no more than 300 milligrams of cholesterol daily. This means cutting way down on organ meats and egg yolks, and restraining yourself when it comes to meat and dairy fats. <p> Substitute for sugar. When eaten alone, sucrose( table sugar) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, such as potatoes and wheat. But research shows that when eaten in combination with equal amounts of other starches, sucrose does n't seem to have this effect. So the ADA says you may be able to have modest amounts of sugar, as found in very simple desserts, such as a cookie or a small dish of frozen yogurt, if your diabetes is under control and you 're not too overweight.( Testing your blood glucose occasionally after meals that include such sweets can tell you how well your body is tolerating them.) Otherwise, check out alternative sweeteners. " They 're certainly safe to use, " Franz says. The ADA has approved noncaloric sweeteners, such as aspartame and saccharin, and sweeteners with calories, such as fructose and sorbitol. Some considerations : Proceed with caution. People with well-controlled diabetes can use fructose and sorbitol( both found in fruit) with little problem, the ADA says. Fructose raises blood sugar the least of the caloric sweeteners. But, warns Stanley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sinai School of Medicine of the City University of New York, " in people with low insulin reserves, fructose will raise triglycerides, " blood fats that are dangerous at high levels. And in large amounts, both fructose and sorbitol can cause diarrhea. Beware : calories ahead. Calorie-rich fructose and sorbitol( which breaks down in the body to form fructose), are not exchanges for the noncaloric sweeteners. So if you 've added fructose and taken out saccharin, you 've still added calories to your diet. <p> Consider eating smaller meek more often. Usually, the diabetic body can handle smaller meals more easily because the smaller the meal, the less insulin is needed to handle the glucose influx from each meal, Franz says. Less glucose equals less insulin equals more constant blood-sugar levels. Some diabetes meal plans call for three meals a day but others call for three small meals plus one to three small snacks be-tween meals( a piece of fruit or a couple of crackers, for example). @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because " often if people go too long between meals, they get so hungry they ca n't control what they eat at the next meal. " Check with your doctor for a recommendation. <p> Do n't take fish-oil supplements. Fish oil, especially the kind containing lots of omega-3 fatty acids, may be bad news for people with diabetes. It 's been shown to increase blood glucose levels if you take too much of it. One study showed a loss of blood sugar control when 5.5 grams of omega-3 were taken daily for a month. But eating fish is encouraged -- it 's part of a healthy diet and in this form it wo n't provide too much omega-3 fatty acids. <p> Use care with alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood-sugar level. That 's why the ADA recommends you drink only in moderation-no more than one to two ounces of alcohol at a time and no more than twice a week. That 's a weekly maximum of three ounces of distilled beverage, eight ounces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink with food. Light beer and dry wine may be the way to go because they have fewer carbohydrates ; it 's important to get your carbohydrates from food. Also, remember to treat booze like fat. Exchange alcohol calories for fat calories, the ADA says, because alcohol is high in calories per gram and because it 's metabolized like fat. <p> Lose weight. " Weight loss is the number-one priority, " Dr. Mirsky says. Eighty percent of type-II diabetics are overweight. They tend to live a sedentary life and eat a lot. Obesity may obliterate insulin receptors so sugar ca n't enter the cells and so remains in your blood. If you 're overweight, diet and exercise almost certainly can help you lose some weight and get your blood sugar back to normal, and that may be all you need, Dr. Mirsky says. " Sometimes, all you have to lose is 5 or 10 pounds and you 're fine. " Good advice : <p> Do n't go to extremes. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prudent diet, improved eating habits and exercise. A low-fat diet with moderate calorie restriction( women, not less than 1,200 calories a day, men not less than 1,500) works best for diabetics. <p> Do n't let frustration drive you to a fad diet, Franz warns. " If all the fad diets worked, we would n't need new ones all the time. They may not be nutritionally sound, and they may be so restrictive people ca n't stick with them. Plus, they do n't help you change your eating behavior in the long run. " <p> Nor should you skip meals in hopes of losing weight, Franz says. This " minifasting " is ultimately self-defeating. " So many people skip breakfast and lunch. Then they go on an eating binge later. " Fads, fasting and skipping meals do n't work, and you could end up losing control of your diabetes altogether. <p> Make losing excess weight a family affair. " If the whole family does n't make nutritional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franz says, " it will be hard, if not impossible, for the person with diabetes to do it alone. " <p> Exercise. The benefits of regular exercise for everybody, diabetic or not, are well recognized. But people with diabetes have even more reason to get their arms and legs moving and their hearts pumping. Exercise strengthens the heart, helps control blood-sugar levels, and increases circulation to the body 's extremities. Exercise can cut the level of cholesterol and triglycerides while raising the level of HDL( high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol( the " good " kind that protects against heart disease). Exercise helps you control your weight, increase stamina and sleep more soundly. <p> And exercise really helps shore up your emotional fortitude. " Regular exercise has been shown to have beneficial effects on mood, especially for depression, " says health psychologist Paula Hartman -- Stein, Ph.D., of the Akron General Medical Center, in Ohio. <p> There 's also some evidence that exercise increases the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a place to put glucose, and glucose can get to where it 's needed -- inside the cells. <p> Repetitive, rhythmic movements involving the large muscles -- arms and legs -- are best for people with diabetes. Exercises that work the large muscles include walking, jogging, swimming, rowing and bicycling. In order to attain the maximum benefits, you have to exercise regularly and do it at least three times a week for 20 to 30 minutes, the experts say. Your doctor may even prescribe an exercise five to seven times a week. Do n't lift weights. And do n't do anything else that involves pushing or pulling heavy objects. It raises your blood-sugar levels and blood pressure, and can make diabetic eye disease worse. Start walking. " The best exercise for people with diabetes is brisk walking, " says Henry Dolger, M.D., former chief of the diabetes department at Mount Sinai Medical Center, in New York City. " It 's by far the safest, least stressful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency of every unit of insulin taken in or produced by the body, " Dr. Dolger explains. " That means you get more effectiveness out of every gram of food you eat than you would without exercise. It also gives you a great sense of well-being and requires no equipment. " If you started walking a mile every day, burning 100 calories, in only a year you 'd shed more than 10 pounds. Check with your doctor. If your diabetes is n't under control or you have complications, exercise can make it worse. If you 've got high blood pressure, that also needs to be controlled first. Your doctor may want you to take a stress test. He 'll want to judge the effects of any medication you 're taking. <p> Take care of your teeth. " A person with diabetes has to maintain an absolutely immaculate mouth, " says Roger P. Levin, D.D.S., chairman of the Maryland State Dental Association Council on Dental Practice. " Because diabetics are much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gum disease. " Be meticulous. Everything a nondiabetic person should do for dental health, a diabetic person should do even more conscientiously. This means more frequent visits to your dentist and especially conscientious brushing and flossing to control plaque and tartar. Pursue a perfect fit. " Restorations must be very well contoured in a diabetic, " Dr. Levin says. Poorfitting dentures, bridges or crowns can cause mouth sores, which can become serious because of inefficient healing. And because wounds do n't heal well, the person with diabetes is not a candidate for most of the newer techniques, such as dental implants. <p> Reduce stress. " Stress and anxiety can destabilize diabetic control in two ways, " Dr. Hartman -- Stein says. " Some people 's blood sugar can skyrocket, others ' goes way down. And when diabetics are depressed or anxious, frequently they do n't adhere to their diet and exercise regimen very well. " <p> Diabetes, with its constant emotional and physical demands, is a stressful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stressful life events they 're having trouble coping with, they should seek the help of a mental-health professional, " Dr. Hartman-Stein says. Here are some ways you can relieve stress : Learn how to relax. Dr. Hartman-Stein tested various relaxation-therapy techniques for diabetes control and found that they " may be helpful. " Relaxation techniques focus on controlled breathing, relaxing muscles and visualization, and can be learned from professionals, books and articles.( See " Unwind and Destress : Part II " in the August 1990 issue.) Improve your perspective. You are more than a case of diabetes. " Some people do focus on it too much. They label themselves as having this chronic illness, and it colors everything, " Dr. Hartman -- Stein says. " Well, it does n't have to color everything. You do have to be more disciplined about your daily life in terms of your eating schedule, but it does n't have to hamper you. You need to add uplifts to your daily life for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a box of cookies to make themselves feel better. One woman told me she rents videotapes and indulges herself when she 's feeling depressed or stressed. " Learn how to think. Cognitive therapy teaches you to " recognize the kinds of thinking you engage in that might be affecting your mood, " says Dr. Hartman -- Stein. " You might have thoughts like, ' My legs are really ugly because of the marks from injecting insulin, ' or I feel like a freak every time l have to test my urine. ' You can turn those negative thoughts about the regimen into a more rational way of looking at it. You can instead think, Nobody 's noticing those little marks in my skin but me, ' or Testing my urine iS a chemistry experiment. "( See " Unwind and Destress : Part I " in the July 1990 issue.) <p> Test your blood. Over-the-counter blood-glucose testing kits can run into money -- up to $750 a year if you test your blood four times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Franz says. " Urine testing for type-diabetes is quite inaccurate because you can get quite a high blood-sugar level before sugar spills into the urine, " especially if you 're older. Blood testing can tell you when you have high blood sugar without symptoms. If your diabetes is mild or controlled, Franz says, you may not need to test your blood as often as four times a day. But you do need to know how often and how to test accurately. Ask your doctor or diabetes educator. <p> Use care with OTCs. Some over-thecounter drugs( OTCs) contain sugar and other ingredients that can disturb blood-sugar levels. Always check the label for any warning directed to people with diabetes, but do n't stop there. Ask the pharmacist or your doctor if you 're not sure, and be sure to monitor your reactions after taking any OTC medication. Here are some things to look out for : Ephedrine or epinephrine. These are used in preparations that treat respiratory illnesses, but they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can phenylephrine, a drug found in nasal sprays and cold preparations. Caffeine. The main ingredient in OTC appetite suppressants is caffeine, which can raise blood-sugar levels when taken in large amounts. Many headache and cold medications also are loaded with caffeine. Large quantities of aspirin. Taken for chronic pain, big doses can lower blood-sugar levels. Occasional small amounts, such as two tablets for a headache, are not enough to worry about. <p> Excerpted from The Doctors Book of Home Remedies by the editors of Prevention Magazine Heatth Books. <p>
