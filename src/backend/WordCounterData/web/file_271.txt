5053841 <p> So you 're saying that the 5.1 output from the tv " Apps " are the only thing which is surround sound? And that passthrough is not supported in any way? I have never tested that. I always just go to the AVR. <p> A lot of the newer 2012 model TV 's, DO output DD5.1 on the optical output when DD5.1 comes in via HDMI - meaning you can connect your A/V receiver to that output. <p> never heard of that. Can you point to me any proof of that these TVs actually accept DD5.1 from hdmi inputs? <p> I should n't have too but since its Turkey Day, I will Link. I only know in that I have 3 sets in the home right now( 2 from Panasonic and one from Sony 55EX500) that all have this capability. The In-laws just grabbed a newer LG 3D TV and it also supports this. Its becoming fairly routine in newer and even some older sets.. <p> My new Sharp, LC70LE874U, does n't appear to. May be a setting, IDK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does. <p> This is relevant only because the Echo will have to support both passthrough and PMC 2.0, vis HDMI I guess. <p> I agree. IMO if DTS conversion at the echo is not supported it will be a major disappointment. I think, what this will mean is that an AVR will be required to watch anything with DTS audio. Just not going to be able to convince the wife to allow another one of those " receiver " things in the bedroom. <p> As a note your TV sounds like its capable of bitstreaming the audio as long as the downstream device can accept it.. <p> From the Manual Audio Setup You can output digital audio to an AV ampli? er or similar device whose DIGITAL AUDIO INPUT terminal is connected to the DIGITAL AUDIO OUTPUT terminal on the TV.

Is this what you 're asking for? I posted this on the beta forums, and got no response( surprisingly). Then again, I could do this on my DMA2100 as well. <p> Okay, this is all fine and all but it still does n't solve the problem of connecting the Echo to an regular old TV and hearing anything when there is dts content being streamed to it. <p> I 've been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Echo on my lower bit-rate movies... plays in 2ch.

I will look at your posts on ceton same user name? <p> huh! i was quoting the manual for the sharp Tv nothing to do with Panasonic. What are you referring to? Or are you trying to re-affirm the statement about DD 5.1 HDMI in and Out? edit : Look at page 59 of your TV 's manual. It speaks to IN and Out. Looks like the Viera Link settings need to be set correctly, I think.. <p> Sorry. You mentioned you have two Panasonic that work and hence I tried to find out the details assumed you posted the Panny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have 3 earlier models of Panasonic TVs. I 've downloaded and read the VT50 manual and Panasonic said nothing about the HDMI in limitations. But a search on VT50 owners thread indicates that it wo n't support DD 5.1 if the source is HDCP encrypted and use of ARC is needed to pass that back to an AVR via HDMI. <p> huh! i was quoting the manual for the sharp Tv nothing to do with Panasonic.

Figured that was what happened. I think this is a very confusing topic by the way and do n't envy any CE mfg trying to implement it.. <p> IIRC, On my GT I had to change the Default speakers setting from " TV " to " Theater " in the TV setup. I do n't have the pan setup this way anymore as I now have a ARC capable AVR and use HDMI in/out. if I can get behind the TV I can try it out at some point. <p> Really.

It is a futile excercise. If you have a HDMI AVR already, there is no reason to use it ever. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I have n't tested *everything* DTS that I have on it, but it did play the audio when I tried it - I 'll have to try playing more when I get back and can post some of the mkv details on the ones that do work..

That 's my assumption. <p> Motz- Can you give us some sort of update on the 1080i problem? It seems like there 's many of us that think 1080i playback is nearly unwatchable, and even those that do n't think its a showstopper still think that it looks pretty bad.

Will this get fixed before release? <p> +1 You need sea sick pills to watch... And with CableCard 1080 is pretty much all you get. <p> I think its kinda obvious that this thing is going to be released to the public on 11-30-2012 with only 720p support and no 1080i or 1080p upon initial public release. I don, t know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ceton can give us some confirmation or road map otherwise. If this is the case I think they should admit that this is really just a public beta product and not truly ready for prime time use. <p> I think its kinda obvious that this thing is going to be released to the public on 11-30-2012 with only 720p support and no 1080i or 1080p upon initial public release.

If this is the case I think they should admit that this is really just a public beta product and not truly ready for prime time use. <p> The problem with 1080i material is a different issue than the 720p output restriction, although it might be tangentially related. The Echo will only output at 720p0- that 's a known and acknowledged limitation of the current firmware. The problem is that there 's a bug in the playback of 1080i material. I 'm not sure where the problem is, but my guess is probably the deinterlacer. Considering so much HD material is 1080i, I do n't think the Echo is a usable product without Ceton fixing this problem first. We 'll see if they come up with a fix in the next week. But considering this bug has been known for quite a while now I would n't hold my breath... <p> He probably does not but you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delaying things. <p> I agree with this - as much as I 'd like the Echo to hit the public on target, I think it needs another few weeks to a month to be ready to release. Just my opinion and not a negative take on the actual product - it 's going to be great once the existing items are resolved. <p> Do you have an actual source to back this up? " Kinda obvious " sounds like you have some inside information to which the rest of us are not privy. <p> I have no special sources other than the many posts here about the current state of the Ceton Echo and the fact that time is not on there side. Besides I invited someone from Ceton to state something to the contrary in my original post. I want Ceton to succeed, I am also a beta tester like you but am very disappointed to date. i am in the process of converting from Sage TV to MCE &; the Ceton is a big part of my future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> +1 You need sea sick pills to watch... And with CableCard 1080 is pretty much all you get. <p> I was going to say " which begs the question ".......... instead I will just come out with an irrefutable statement. At this point the Echo is not in the least suitable for its intended purposed.. Or to phrase it more candidly it is a stinking POS. It would be one thing if if was limited to 720P output if it effectively deinterlaced and downrezzed 1080i content. Display output issues of that nature are fundamental to the chipset, this is literally beyond belief considering the projected delivery.
