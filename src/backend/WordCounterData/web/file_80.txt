5034541 <h> share this story <p> In June, the Washington Post reported on an interview with Olympic hurdler, Lolo Jones, who revealed that at age 29 she remains a virgin. Jones remarked : <p> " It 's just a gift I want to give my husband. But please understand this journey has been hard. There 's virgins out there and I want to let them know that it 's the hardest thing I 've ever done in my life. Harder than training for the Olympics. Harder than graduating from college has been to stay a virgin before marriage. I 've been tempted, I 've had plenty of opportunities. " <p> As Jones spoke, the interviewer had a hard time restraining laughter and at points simply did n't. The interview went viral and comments ranged from mockery to admiration, depending on the perspective. <p> Lolo Jones is a marvelous Olympic hurdler who learned her trade the hard way -- by overcoming difficult hurdles in her life. She is determined to carve out for herself a very different future, and her Christianity is fueling her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sexual purity is regarded as archaic, nave and joke fodder for late night television. Jones and others, such as NFL quarterback Tim Tebow, are to be commended for their principled stances. We all know that Christians have their work cut out for them to counteract prevailing American sexual mores that reduce male/female relationships to sex and little else. <p> But there is so much more to say. Christianity is not confined simply to premarital virginity. On the one hand, any single Christian who commits to sexual purity in obedience to Christ should be esteemed. On the other hand, the so-called " virginity movement, " helpful as it may be, is not nor should it be equated with Christianity. To do so sells the Gospel short and leads to all sorts of false notions of where young women find their true worth and what young Christian men should prize in them. Here 's what I mean. <p> A message of purity and abstinence, as important as this is for young women( young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young American girls, including those in church pews. It is utterly devastating to the one-in-four girls who is sexually abused before she reaches her 18th birthday. We live in a world where by the age of 18 an estimated 70 percent of girls have had sex at least once and not always by choice, where globally countless women and girls are in the grips of sex traffickers, where an appalling 48 women are raped every hour in the Congo, where within our own borders sexual freedom has opened the door for young women to be as sexually promiscuous as men, and where some girls with the very best of intentions succumb to temptation. I grieve all of this, but do not for a second imagine that any of this means a woman has less to offer a husband or that in any sense it diminishes her worth. <p> The Gospel message for women and girls is bigger than moral purity. It is a life-changing message that secures every young woman 's place in God 's Story and leaves no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture and the other voices that beckon to her, this message secures her identity as a woman as well as her purpose and meaning for the road ahead, no matter what she sees when she looks in the rearview mirror. <p> Every girl, virgin or not, bears God 's image in her soul. God created his daughters and his sons to be his image bearers. His vision from creation was for his daughters to be his representatives in this world -- to speak and act on his behalf. This gives significance to every aspect of a girl 's life and means, of course, that God wants every one of his daughters to know him in deep ways, to love what he loves, and to invest her life to advance his kingdom wherever she may find herself. <p> Every girl, virgin or not, is a warrior for God 's good purposes on earth. When God said, " It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper ezer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishing the fact that his sons and daughters need each other. The Hebrew word ezer( rhymes with razor) is a military term used 16 out of 21 times in the Old Testament for God as the Help of his people. As ezer-warriors, God 's daughters join their brothers in the fierce battle against the Enemy. The mission of God in the world requires, by God 's own statement, the joint efforts of his sons and daughters. They are to be a Blessed Alliance in taking back territory the Enemy has seized -- both within marriage and also as members of the Body of Christ. <p> This vision raises the bar for every young woman by calling her to use her mind, as well as her heart, soul and strength, in pursuit of a deeper relationship with God and of the wisdom and courage to represent him. With Jesus as her North Star, she sees what needs to be done and does it. When she sees suffering and injustice in God 's world( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as God 's image bearer and takes responsibility to right the wrongs and to share the good news of Jesus. <p> I 'm thrilled that Christians like Lolo Jones are in the Olympics. But what she has to offer a husband is more precious than her virginity or a gold medal. As a bearer of God 's image and as an ezer-warrior for God, she will be a blessed ally to a husband as together they engage the challenges of life in a fallen world. <p> Christine J. Gardner convincingly argues that the abstinence movement works against the most profound Christian values of selflessness and sacrifice and instead adopts rock concert style techniques of pop culture as a tool to get people to turn against that pop culture. <p> I embraced the image of myself as the radical abstinence practitioner until I became engaged at the age of 24. Up to this point, my pride had deluded me into thinking that I had a balanced, Godly view of sexuality. <p> We all have impressions of what to expect from " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples illustrate, it is wise not to have high expectations of groups and instead rely upon dedicated and heroic individuals. <p> South Africa 's Cameron Van Der Burgh won the gold medal in the 100M breaststroke in world record time. But his victory came under scrutiny after the Australian team accused him of making illegal " dolphin kicks. " <p> The Summer Olympics are beginning next month and London 2012 hype is in full swing. It was just a matter of time before some guy took the time to write an absurdly retro article telling straight dudes how female athletes are like, totally hot. <p> God wants us to remain virgins until we are married. That IS important to Him. But, it is not instant condemnation... <p> Now to live a fornicating life is NOT what God want 's either. He wants us fitting those urges and to do the right thing, which is to marry, in order to have a safe and healthy sex life. <p> This is why more single people get STDs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married people. It is the single people with the highest rate of murder in the womb and having to run out and by contraceptives or have to worry about how their world is going to be so devastated when if they have a child and are not married. <p> God want 's us to have sex with that ONE person that we are married to. Not someone that we really love. Because if we really love them and they really love us, we would what and do it the right way. <p> How do I know this? All of the women I love wound up leaving me, even though we had sex. <h> Loading comments... <p> Though you recite the word well, and utilize the Hebrew, I fear some of your understanding of what Lolo Jones has said is greatly misunderstood, or at the very least misplaced. We are not talking RAPE here! We are talking about offering to the one person that you love yourself. This creates what is known as a soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raped, make a mistakes etc. That is far different from what she is trying to convey to this next generation of young women coming up through the ranks. The point is to stay chaste for a healthier relationship in accordance with the scriptural principles. Society on a whole does n't emphasize chastity, and from your article it sounds like you think that is acceptable. As director of a pregnancy crisis center in the 80 's I saw too many shattered lives from unwanted pregnancies, none were from rape. I am also well versed in the pain of rape, so I get it maybe better than most. Lolo is sending a message to girls to remain chaste. That is very difficult and yet brings its rewards. Christianity is not built on one precept, but instead, precept upon precept. Do n't take what she is saying out of context to make a point. That is neither accurate or fair to the message that this young woman is sending. <p> MadameTiffany : Though you recite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author is saying is that in this sentence : " We are talking about offering to the one person that you love yourself. "... the " yourself " that you mention encompasses so much more than your virginity. It encompasses your sexuality( which continues to exist after one 's virginity is gone), your mind, your personality, your emotional makeup, your maturity, the breadth and depth of your life experiences, your appearance and what your choose to do with it, your weaknesses and illnesses, your relationships and family and friends... so few people would look at a man and evalute him and " what he brings to the relationship " based on whether he was a virgin. But much of the religious world does seem to do this, especially where women are concerned. And it 's such a narrow and impartial picture of what makes a person " valuable " to their love ones - significant other included - that it *is* laughable when it 's treated with such seriousness. When addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait to have with someone with whom they are serious about building a long-term sexual relationship - then it 's not laughable at all, and should be a choice that everyone feels free to make without harassment or ridicule. <h> Loading comments... <p> I like this article and it is true, not having sex before marriage is not the Full GOSPEL, but it is part of it. And this is not just for Girls and Women, but Boys and Men also. It is not good for a Man to touch a Woman, but to avoid fornication, let every man have his own Wife and let every Woman have her own Husband.( I Corinthians 7:1-2) Those who have fallen short, Repent, Turn and Thank GOD for Forgiveness :) and To GOD Be The GLORY. <p> God cares as much about your virginity as he does about how much you lie. The thrust of this article is that Christians behave like their virginity is the most important thing to God when it 's only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others. I 've been in too many churches where virginity seems more to be more important than how we treat our enemies and neighbors. How about this? You can care about virginity as much as you want, as long as you care about everything else just as much. So many Christians think that sexual purity is the biggest issue facing young Christians, when it 's really the spiritual apathy that comes as a result of the church making it seem that the spiritual health of a Christian is measured by how much they think about and do sexual acts. <p> " I 'm sure glad God gave us the Holy Spirit so I could stay a virgin till I 'm married. " Sometimes, I get the impression that that 's what a Christian who is on fire for God is supposed to sound like. <p> Carolyn Custis James did say in this article that CHRISTianity is not confined simply to premarital virginity. She also said that The GOSPEL message is bigger than moral purity, so I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their virginity is the most important part of being a CHRISTian. Even her title indicates that. ' T is true GOD did not give us The Full GOSPEL for us to pick out what we want and just focus on that, for HE wants us fully equipped unto all good works according to HIS WORD.( II Timothy 3:16-17) <p> LastDays1 : Carolyn Custis James did say in this article that CHRISTianity <h> Loading comments... <h> Loading comments... <p> You say some important things but the message is confusing. We always have the opportunity to be redeemed but part of you message seems to be that it does n't really matter. You also make a huge leap in judgement that people that are committed to God 's plan for sexual intimacy and having children in a sacred marriage do not understand or have the depth of understanding the full message. <p> The message is n't confusing and she does n't make that leap. The thing that bothers you is that she does n't think people 's virginity is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that she does n't want to measure how strong a person 's faith is by how much they value their virginity. Yeah, I 'm pretty sure when he commented on how strong that gentile 's faith was in Jesus ' ability to heal, Jesus was factoring in how that gentile stayed a virgin until he was married. <p> gdestroyer8 : The message is n't confusing and she does n't make that leap. <h> Loading comments... <p> It 's sad how many people, even as adults, still try to use the peer pressure tactic to make others feel bad about their decision to stay pure until marriage. Be carefully what you teach your kids because you can be ruining their lives just because of your selfish thoughts. <h> Loading comments... <p> I have never thought of God as an entity setting on a throne making rules like " do n't drink because it offends Me ". I think the ' Rules " are there to prevent us from suffering and/or harming ourselves and others. Premarital or extramarital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger, depression, etc. Therefore, it is best not to have sex until married and then only with your spouse. Thou shall have no other Gods but me. Very hard to worship the accumulation of money or power and still follow Christian values and not hurt someone else. Thou shall not envy what others have. Desiring what someone else has, you develop hero worship and become single purpose in obtaining what the other person has in anyway you can obtain it. You shall not lie. It always catchs up to you and you and/or your family and descendents suffer. There is a reason for God 's Rules and we need to see the deeper meaning, remembering He always forgives our failures if we sincerely ask. <p> I agree. Having grown up surrounded by some pretty fundamentalist conservative Christian church populations, I have to point out, though, that marital sex can( and does, not infrequently) also lead to disease, divorce, anger, depression, etc. <p> I agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's spouse is also following the same path, otherwise you 're still going to have to deal with the emotional impact of knowing they 've been with others - is likely the easiest emotional path, long term. That said, I watched friends who did n't feel they needed to work on any other aspect of themselves because they felt guaranteed a good marriage simply because they 'd " waited. " I 've seen people convince themselves that, because they 'd found another virgin, they were perfect together. They 'd marry, despite red flags around money, gambling, anger issues, etc., and 7 years later be in a miserable, unhappy, combative marriage. <p> Virginity is not a guarantee of ANYTHING. It 's a not a guarantee that your future will be bright, your marriage will be good, your future spouse wo n't have STDs or hit you or have trouble holding down a job or be honest or faithful, that your inlaws wo n't be emotionally abusive. Virginity is a choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this moment in your life and how you feel and where your energy and time and investment goes. It 's a choice to not worry about getting pregnant or catching an STD *today*. And that 's fantastic. <p> JoelyBow : I agree. Having grown up surrounded by some pretty fundamentalist <p> Are n't Christians supposed to be transformed and renewed daily? You phrase it as if the transformation and renewal you receive from repenting from having sex is the most important thing you can experience as a follower of Jesus. Neither myself nor the author is arguing that it is n't valuable or important. I 'm saying that it 's not the most important or critical aspect of your life as a Christ follower. For someone who has struggled with that and overcome it, it can be very important, but if you build your faith around one milestone rather than the actual gospel of Christ, then you 're building it wrong. <h> Loading comments... <h> Loading comments... <p> " It is utterly devastating to the one-in-four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthday. " <p> Surely you must have an actual peer reviewed study of every woman being questioned to verify this statement? How often will the false statistic be reguritated? According to this number, one in four girls is sexually abused by before 18. According to another study one in four women in college get sexually abused. Yet according to studies conducted by the same people, in the overall population one in five women will get sexually abused over the course their entire life. Surely anyone can see the fraud of any of these claims. --------------- " His vision from creation was for his daughters to be his representatives in this world " <p> As if women are representative of God by merely existing as women? Are you joking? -------------- When God said, " It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper ezer for him "( Genesis 2:18), he was establishing the fact that his sons and daughters need each other. " <p> How did you come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feminism 101? <p> I hope one day you experience something that helps you appreciate the value of women to God, mankind, and the church. I know reading that makes you hate me more. I know that hate. Hopefully something can transform it into love and understanding. I do n't want you to be like me. I 'm nothing to aspire to, but I hope you can be more Christlike. We need more Christlike people, and transforming you would produce someone with a really good story to tell. <h> Loading comments... <p> I know a lot of men respond to that statistic with such skepticism, and my initial reaction to it - as a woman - was similar, but then I sat down and started thinking. I do n't think of myself as one of the statistic, but when I break down the facts, I am. Several times over, in fact. And I grew up in a family that homeschooled and had us in church 4 times a week, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. That stuff happened while I was inside the church doors, sometimes. And my sister is the same. And my mother qualifies. And if I picture my girlfriends, more than half qualify. And all of these people I 'm thinking of are members of a fairly polished, connected, college-educated( if not Phd, M.D., J.D., etc.) crowd. <p> So in perspective, I 'd have to venture a guess that the statistics are probably closer to 50-75%, unless you define sexual abuse as rape and rape only. I realize that 's only based on my experience, but my " crowd " would be expected to have lower rates than normal, statistically. <p> If you asked my amazing brothers, though, who grew up alongside all of the same people, I 'm sure they 'd express substantial skepticism as well. It 's not something we generally share with men.

Jeeze <p> I have stepped into many a fundamentalist church filled with love, that is, until you share that you may have a Christian idea or two that is different from theirs.
