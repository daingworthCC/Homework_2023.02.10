5251741 <p> What is this tape, and does it actually work? As a part-time athlete who played tennis for years and years ; I have sore knees, a tempermental shoulder and lower back issue that creeps up from time to time. If this tape works, I might be looking like a mummy the next time I head to the golf course. <p> Dr. David Geier, Orthopaedic Surgeon and Director of MUSC Sports Medicine in Charleston, South Carolina says there is a time and place for this stretchy cotton tape everyone seems to talking about and wearing. <p> Olympic athletes are loving Kinesio tape <p> Photo credit : <p> Ryan Pierse <p> " It depends on what you are using it for, " expalined Dr. Geier. " For shoulder pains and knee issues, I see some merit. " <p> At one televised event, I saw a female athelete with the tape on her side, her back and on her calves. I asked Dr. Geier if this was overkill. <p> " It could be, " Geier stated, implying that it may be helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes you think it is doing something, and it may not be. " <p> Can you say Placebo Effect? <p> Geier did say some doctors at the Medial College of South Carolina are recommending it, but to make it work, it has to be applied correctly. <p> " It has to be applied in a certain direction and a therapist needs to show the athlete how to put it on correctly, " adds Geier. " If you do n't know how to put it on, it wo n't do any good. " <p> Kinesio tape is n't all that new, it has been around since the 1980s. <p> The Kinesio tape brand was founded by Kenzo Kase, a Japanese chiropractor to support injured muscles and joints of his patients. <p> Olympic atheltes were given the tape to try at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and they seemed to like the way it felt and looked. <p> " Looked " is the key word there as some think the athletes are wearing it to make a fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm waiting for the first NBA player to use the tape to spell out the initials of his newborn son or when will Nike get involved in having the strips cut into swooshes? <p> I also asked Dr. Geier if athletes using the tape are in danger of additional injuries since the tape corrects muscle balance. He did n't so, but he said there are unanswered questions. <p> Look for Kinesio tape while you watch the remaining days of the Olympics and then into football, basketball and at the U.S. Open tennis later this month. <p> Rick C.
