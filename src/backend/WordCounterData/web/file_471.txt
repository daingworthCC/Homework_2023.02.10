5073941 <p> hi friends! i 'm in tech-land again. and this time, i 'm sequestered in waterbury, CT. because the show takes so long to tech and the venues are so expensive, the producers have shipped us to one of the most terrifying cities i 've ever been in. there have already been a few " incidents " since we 've been here. it 's a vey sad little town with a lot of desperate people. we are not to even walk to the theatre( 4 min away) without a buddy... yay! <p> it really puts a damper on my little free spirit. no car. no food options( except subway and dunkin donuts). no fridge in my hotel room. woof. even when i was on tour, i 'd generally rent a car in every city so i felt like an actual human. i loOove exploring new places and i 'm sure there are lovely sections of waterbury, but..... i 'll never see them. here are a few of my rehearsal shots.... my costumes are totally gorgeous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wait to show the completed look. <p> my rendering <p> lunch at brgr always includes a 3 oz shake shot. the perfect dessert! <p> tinsel tinsel all around... <p> we wear " rehearsal pods " so we can become accustomed to our " who walk " and spacing restrictions.... it gets pretty hot in there..... <p> rehearsal shoes... i think these belonged to a " mama " from past years... one of her feet was a size and a half bigger than the other.... they drove me nuts. thankfully, my new shoes came in yesterday and i 'm taking my sweet time breaking them in. <p> my NYU graduation was at madison square garden and i 've always wanted to play there! <p> *** i am ONLY performing in t he GRINCH in NEW YORK and BOSTON. there are 2 companies of the GRINCH this year..... a non-equity tour will do more cities and the equity tour( starring Jeff McCarthy as the grinch and ME) will only perform in those two cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really great number called " whatchamawho. " it is LOUD and incredibly cardio-heavy. i 'm so happy i 'm not in it..... just watching it makes my joints hurt. these people are so talented. <p> we all deal with things in our own way..... this was a convo i had with J before our first run-thru in the rehearsal studio. hilarious. <p> one of the littles who plays " annie who " is the most adorable little southern creature with a long thick mane of hair.... you ca n't tell, but this fishtail( that i made- i 'm such a good " mama ") is about a foot and a half long... and fastened with mistletoe, naturally.... <h> Friday, November 9, 2012 <p> i think i may have told you this before, but i was once courted by a man( with great musical taste) who created 48 mix CDs for me. he introduced me to eva cassidy, david wilcox, iron and wine, and a lot of other late 90 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my life for well over a decade.... i knew the days of receiving my weekly mix CD were quickly coming to an end when i started receiving tracks like bonnie raitt 's " i ca n't make you love me " and david wilcox 's " language of the heart. " <p> i think that 's around the time i was dubbed a " runaway bride. " i was 19. <p> needless to say, i 've heard that nickname a few times since( though, to my credit, i cut it off before a proposal is involved- just the discussion makes me run). <p> however, inspired by the power of the mix, i 've made a few for very special people. nothing, to me, is a more intimate gift than a song dedicated to you. remember how much i loved my " ebony eyes " gift? i can always gauge my interest level by whether or not i start a mix playlist for the man. if he inspires music i know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful place. and since people in my world generally " own " the songs i 've given to them( or they to me), my pool of love songs gets smaller and smaller... i would never re-gift the same song! good thing so many tunes are left to be sung. <h> Thursday, November 8, 2012 <p> i had to leave miss stella in utah because i shot back to nyc by way of disneyland and she was n't invited. i also knew i 'd be in intense rehearsals and tech and she 'd be much happier snuggling with dad and harassing the water dogs and bunny instead of being stuck in our apartment. <p> but it feels so strange to be without her. i miss that little nugget. L sent 4 fabulous costumes for halloween so she naturally wore them all that night. she 's a true nyc diva. <h> Monday, November 5, 2012 <p> i was lucky enough to have my favorite man in town this weekend. sadly, i was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) so my time was limited. we had a lovely time and i was grateful for the amazing meals and long conversations. he is great. <p> nyc is slowly getting back to " normal. " but we grieve for our friends in jersey and staten island who have lost so much. i 'm so heartened by all of the volunteer efforts and money donated to the sandy relief fund. thank you for supporting us! <p> it is an unwritten rule that the second you publicly declare that you are again attached, every single former boyfriend, almost-someone, or random man on the street( that you 'd at one time, desperately pined for) will find you magnetically attractive and will at once proclaim all the things you 'd ever hope you 'd hear from him. <p> it does n't happen when you " try " to move on. or when you " hope " you 've moved on. <p> we do a lot of " pretending " when we want to get over someone, do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly let those someones go and really, truly, honestly make space for another. <p> the city is strange right now. uptown, we have food, water, heat, electricity and life has resumed very close to normal. we went back to who-ville after 2 days off and many people in my cast and community have lost so much. i have friends who WALKED for 3 hours just to make it to their shows. just a block away from our rehearsal space, the power is out. the lower part of manhattan is without streetlights and my friends say it 's so dark at night that you ca n't see your hand in front of your face. looting has begun, it 's incredibly dangerous, the gas shortage has turned my street into a parking lot of cars hoping to wait hours to get gas, and i ca n't imagine how people are weathering this bitter cold spell. <p> it 's hard not to feel guilty that i was and continue to be so protected. i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been remarkable. at least 5 people have checked on me throughout this ordeal and we have thorough head counts of all people in need. they have also organized major service opportunities for members to help the community and we have opened our homes to people in need of lodging, a shower, or a cell phone charge. i 'm proud of my mormons and my new yorkers. <h> Monday, October 29, 2012 <p> all is well here.... so far. the wind is crazy and we have bursts of angry rain. i hear there is at least 3 ft of flooding just 2 blocks away. meg and i are stir crazy so i made her do a physique dvd with me and she snapped this ridiculous photo of me having a party for my thighs doing " thigh dancing. " <p> i made pumpkin bread, pumpkin chocolate chip cookies, and pasta... so... with all this carb loading, i 'm gon na be all set to run a marathon in the am. <p> please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm off to get into the ice cream( you know, in case we lose power). <p> wahooooo! my dear lala has released her first CD! i 'm so thrilled that she released the live recording of what was an incredibly special night.... i was SO proud to see her shine at the cafe carlyle. what an intimate and sparkling night! <p> this room is iconically beautiful <p> as is my friend, la. please remind me never to wear a smokey eye to one of her performances.... i sob myself silly every single time. <p> here i am with my girl, kirsten copley, who is a mad famous harpist( she 's tight with beyonce, jay, kanye.... you name it.. she 's played with them..) and wife to awesome marc copley who played with me in wonderland and was in la 's incredible band. as was larry lelli. wait till you hear this album! <p> our dear laura has decided to give one MiM reader an autographed copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this. it 's just so good. <p> my bestie, LP, is responsible for most of my new fabulous product finds. she always knows the best of the best and recommended colgate optic white. i 'm totally obsessed! after one week, my teeth were visibly whiter. i love it. y'welcome. <p> i spent the weekend at disneyland with HD, his favorite people( and now mine), &; sussy and her family. it was magic to see the sweet tiny people 's excited faces. we had such a wonderful time and now that i 'm back in nyc, i miss them all more than ever. <p> but being smitten blue is much more manageable than heartbroken blue. <p> we 're finding ways to see each other as much as possible during my 2 month GRINCH lockdown( our show schedule is 10 shows/5 days... oy. a 4 show saturday?!). wish us luck. <p> ok.. so... <p> who is HD? <p> he is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very smart. he is stupid funny. he is incredibly handsome. <p> hi friends. i 'm in utah today.. i WAS in nyc for a strong 4 days but now i 'm in utah for a hot second. my very generous man flew me back for a little r &; r / vacation before i start the grinch and lose my life for the holidays. <h> Sunday, October 7, 2012 <p> -especially since i harped on good jeans in my KSL interview. would n't you know, i found them thru my mom who was getting regular compliments( at the grocery store, no less...) on her pair. paige skyline skinny jeans are grrrreat for girls with a booty and muscular thighs.... i love this wash- the color is slimming and the stretch makes them more comfortable. i 've also found a few pair at the RACK( for half price).... they generally have a good paige selection. <p> strangely( well... not strangely, there is n't a " normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a conversation on a first date which led to me expressing my disinterest in falling in love again( sexy and romantic, i know... it was where i was!).... because for me, love = pain. heartbreak is impressionable that way, i suppose. i was more interested in apathy. if i never care, i never hurt. seemed sound to me. i was comfortable with apathy. in my date 's wisdom( and you should know, we never saw each other after this- maybe because i told him i did n't want to fall in love with him? i du n no... just put 2 and 2 together...) he shared this beautiful excerpt from THE PROPHET by Kahlil Gibran which really moved me. i had been hoping only to live in " love 's peace and love 's pleasure. " and because of that, i would never feel love fully. ugh. it also moved me to open my heart, get ready for the threshing, and well... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @..... hopefully, it will make me " know the secrets of my heart, and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life 's heart. " because, " love crowns you so shall he crucify you for even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning. " being open after intense hurt is hard... and it does n't happen all at once, but growth and love does n't come from apathy.... so here 's to love! enjoy! Then said Almitra, " Speak to us of Love. " And he raised his head and looked upon the people, and there fell a stillness upon them. And with a great voice he said : When love beckons to you follow him, Though his ways are hard and steep. And when his wings enfold you yield to him, Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you. And when he speaks to you believe in him, Though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning. Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun, So shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth. Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself. He threshes you to make you naked. He sifts you to free you from your husks. He grinds you to whiteness. He kneads you until you are pliant ; And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you may become sacred bread for God 's sacred feast. All these things shall love do unto you that you may know the secrets of your heart, and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life 's heart. But if in your fear you would seek only love 's peace and love 's pleasure, Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love 's threshing-floor, Into the seasonless world where you shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weep, but not all of your tears. Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself. Love possesses not nor would it be possessed ; For love is sufficient unto love. When you love you should not say, " God is in my heart, " but rather, I am in the heart of God. " And think not you can direct the course of love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course. Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself. But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires : To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night. To know the pain of too much tenderness. To be wounded by your own understanding of love ; And to bleed willingly and joyfully. To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving ; To rest at the noon hour and meditate love 's ecstasy ; To return home at eventide with gratitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips. <h> Saturday, October 6, 2012 <p> the one thing( along with stella, my computer, and iphone) that i 'd save in the event of a fire. <p> my well loved scriptures. <p> my friends, i wanted this post to come when i was quiet. i took the Book of Mormon challenge in july( this time it took 24 days as opposed to last year 's 20-slacker) and have been with family/friends/cast mates 24/7 since then. i have n't stopped. now that i 'm back in nyc( for a hot second), and alone, and full from a saturday general conference feast, i 'm ready to write about this year 's experience and i 'm eager to hear from those of you who took the challenge. how did it go? <p> this year, my impressions were simple and repetitive. as i wrote about it in my challenge post, i just wanted to reconnect. i did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i wanted to explore but a word kept coming to my mind thru my reading : <p> timing. <p> timing..... hmmmm..... i know i write about it a lot, but i 'm not remotely patient. i want to devour life in one bite. i want it all and i want it now( not unlike willy wonka 's charming veruca). i often think the timing of my expectations is perfect and when life does n't deliver in that way, i am generally discouraged. <p> in the fall of 1998, i wrote the following quote from General Conference in my scriptures : <p> indeed, when we are unduly impatient with an omniscient God 's timing, we really are suggesting that we know what is best. strange, is n't it-- we who wear wristwatches seek to counsel him who oversees cosmic clocks and calendars. elder neal a. maxwell may i just geek out for a second and comment on that brilliant alliteration?! elder maxwell is my literary favorite. ok, ok. here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i read this round, but by a quiet, confident, confirmation repeated in my mind and heart ; i do not know where my life will lead. i do not know when or who i 'll marry. i do not know whether or not i will achieve the goals i have set for my career on broadway or on television. i do not know if i will always live in nyc. <p> but i do know this ; <p> i know that if i am sensitive to the spirit while making every decision in my life, i will be happier than i could ever anticipate. i know that i will be blessed with a choice son to be my partner and i will love him deeply and fully. i know that my life may go in a completely different direction than i have expected and planned for but if it 's the Lord 's will and in the Lord 's timing, i will become the best version of me and will be fulfilled by my experiences. <p> but all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. He loves me. He guides me. <h> who am i? <p> a diaphanous mercurial mormon 's take on dating, culture, and her love affair with the big city. names have been changed to protect the innocent( or not-so-innocent, whatever the case may be) and truthful stories are shared in good fun and hope of betterment of both species. <p> M/A - Model/Actor- definitely has more products, drama, dietary restrictions, clothes than you do and probably wo n't pay for dessert. it 's easy to feel self conscious around a M/A because people are looking at him and not you.... <p> BHH or BYH- Bless Her Heart-- if you say bless her heart after you say something mean,
