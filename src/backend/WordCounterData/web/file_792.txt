5106541 <p> I was messing around in my account and found this. I was aware of pay to watch, but was n't aware of a pay to broadcast. Will this effect twitch side of things too? Or is this just for ads? Details please.. JTV/Twitch has been free, of course you run your ads, but is this changing? Might need to find a new broadcast home if/when I decide to return to casting again. <p> Those packages are more for commercial users, and they have been available for awhile. The only changes I 'm aware of that are coming for individual casters is that JTV is looking at making changes to the Pro account. But nothing definite yet. <p> braoadcasting at justin is free, with that pro broadcaster account you have some extra features( read there) like the viewer pro account jtv is not forcing you to buy it, you just do if you want the extra features <p> I was messing around in my account and found this.

The main feature seems to be to remove the ads from your stream. It looks kind of ridicules to me. Who is going to pay a $1000 a month just for 9000 viewer hours and 1TB of video storage space, plus any overage charges? <p> I 'm pretty sure that for less then a $1000 a month, you could set up your own server to stream 9000 viewer hours of video, and store a terabyte of videos. Hell I have almost a terabyte of videos saved on my old desktop. <p> Then again, I ca n't imagine why anyone would pay $10 a month just to remove ads from JTV. But people seem to be doing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertisements, along with other various features. This is something completely optional - we will not force you to go premium.
