They 've worked together before, on the Blind Boys ' excellent Higher Ground and Spirit of the Century, but here the pairing that Harper has termed " a spiritual soul movement " sounds like an outright tent-revival mission. His fevered wah-wah strutting and sweet high voice take their places in the chorus alongside the raw-throated howl of Blind Boys leader Clarence Fountain and his fellow bass George Scott, who plead for salvation like powerful old lions on " Take My Hand. " The group 's alto, Jimmy Carter, sails over the funky, hiccupping blues beat put down by Harper 's Innocent Criminals on the classic " Satisfied Mind. " The best cut may be Harper 's " Picture of Jesus, " a country-music-informed adventure in old-school church harmonizing with the passionate power to touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blind Boys of Alabama open their mouths to sing, what comes out is older than salvation, older than redemption, it is the sound of oppressions &; struggle. It is the sound of revelation &; liberation. It is a sound as old as time. The Blind Boys of Alabama are the pyramids of gospel music. The birthplace of sacred soul. What started out as me working with them on a couple tracks, blossomed &; bloomed into an entire record in eight days. It all happened so fast. If it were n't for the recordings that prove that this magic actually happened I would not be entirely aware of what went on. - Ben Harper. <p> I did n't know what to expect when I bought this CD. I 'd heard of the Blind Boys of Alabama ever since I was a little girl. My grandparents and my parents loved them. You get to a point in your life when you 'll finally listen to your parents ' music, so I purchased this CD with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least I 'll find out what my folks have been talking about all these years. Boy, was I wrong! Is this gospel music? If it is, then I love gospel music. To me, it 's a combination of rock, soul, and gospel. I can hear a little old school soul here. Otis Redding comes to mind. Especially when Ben and The Blind Boys of Alabama sing the third song, Where Could I Go? I 'd never heard of Ben Harper before but he 's now one of my favorite singers. I love his high, soulful voice. Of course it 's sexy. Is that blasphemous, thinking gospel music is sexy? I do n't think so. Remember Sam Cooke and Ray Charles? Both were rooted in gospel. Both were incredibly gritty soul singers. At any rate, this CD will move you right out of your seat and have you dancing. It 's rock, it 's soul, it 's gospel. It 's fantastic! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consecutive Grammy Awards for Gospel music. Know what? I hear #4 for this CD. <p> Can I get a witness? Say A-men, y'all! <p> Ben Harper has put himself in very deep water this time around. Performing a selection or two with BBA is one thing, but to hang pure for an entire 11 songs over a full CD is altogether a new level. He rises to the challenge by toning down the theatrics and cleverness that will ultimately make him a bonafide rock star. Thank heavens, in more than one way. <p> The resulting CD is filled with genuine emotion. There is n't a single artificial syllable or note. <p> Picking the best o ' the bunch ai n't possible for me as the selections are so consistently strong. Nonetheless " Satisfied Mind, " " Take My Hand, " and " Jesus " will definietly be included on some future " Greatest Hits " collection. <p> Wan na read more of this review? Or just more cd reviews in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me begin by stating a potential bias, Ben Harper is one of my top five bands/artists of all time. There was a period in time when he was competing for #1, but my like for Ben Harper took a bit of a hit after his last studio album release " Diamonds on the Inside ". Going into the aforementioned album Ben Harper had this <p> remarkable streak of doubling his previous album 's sales every time he released a new disc. I saw a documentary about him, and in it they attributed this to Ben 's constant touring and positive word of mouth. It would then follow, that the latest album did n't get so much positive word of mouth. Its not bad, but in my opinion it is clearly the worst album he has released. <p> However, Ben Harper still had a strong enough reputation in my book that I purchased " There Will be A Light " when I saw it on the new releases without having a clue who the Blinds Boys of Alabama were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Blind Boys of Alabama are a group of blind gospel singing old men from Alabama, and Ben Harper collaborates with them on this album to produce an album that while being gospel in nature is really so much more than that. This is a truly inspired effort. Any doubt I had after Ben 's release of " Diamonds on the Inside " was erased after this release. Its not even that it is his best record, it is just that you feel the energy and effort that the older Ben Harper albums have in this recording. But in the end, it is gospel. So anyone who likes Ben Harper should be forewarned, if you could n't see yourself listening to gospel or if you are anti religious. You might want to steer clear. Luckily for me, I find the sound neat. Its cool having a gospel CD in my collection. Just like its cool to have Johnny Cash in my collection. Even if you need to be in a peculiar mood to throw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firing on all cylinders. I have to rank it right up there with the best of Ben Harper. Not quite " Fight For Your Mind ", but not overly far from it either. Its almost like The Blind Boys of Alabama were able to re-inspire Ben Harper. I never respected a musician more than I did Ben Harper after seeing the documentary on him, and after that I just honestly believed he would never ever step backwards. That all his albums would be sensational, and he would never miss on a song. That was a bit much to expect. <p> This album has sparked a renassaince for Ben Harper on my stereo. <p> I ca n't stop listening to his music. So if you are into Ben Harper, and also think you might be into some old style gospel with Ben Harper infused into it. Then get your hands on this album. The girl I bought it from said " its almost like you could put this on and listen to it rather than going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but I completely understand where she was coming from. You feel good after listening to this album even if you are n't religious at all. <p> Tracks I can recommend : " Take My Hand ", " Wicked Man ", " Church <p> House Steps ", " Well, well, well ", " satisfied ", " there
