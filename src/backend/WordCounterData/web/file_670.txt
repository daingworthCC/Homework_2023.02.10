5094041 <p> The 2012 Election Day is upon us, and here are some Web and mobile apps to help you make your voting decision, keep track of results, and show off your freedom of speech. <p> Yoohoo, it 's election day. Do you still feel unprepared to tackle the voting booth today? No worries, that 's what these helpful apps and widgets are here for. You still have some time to get extra insight on your political candidates this year, ranging from apps that focus on particular issues or ones to help you track poll results. <p> Remember how people flipped out about a rumor that retailer Urban Outfitters CEO Richard Hayne may have been donating money to support Republican presidential nominee Rick Santorum?( PolitiFact confirmed Hayne did contribute some money, but not for the current presidential election). That vice versa mentality might be just as important to you when it comes to political candidates. Where are they getting their funding from? Who 's supporting them, and do you support those companies and institutions as well? <p> If these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Politicians? app. You can search for politicians by name or state, and each has a list of total contributions received and a top 10 list of major benefactors so you know who has invested in your candidate. The financial figures come straight from the Federal Election Commisison, so the information is always up-to-date. <p> Social media plays a big role in this year 's election as Twitter becomes a more prominent networking tool than ever. With the Political Engagement Map, you can check how each presidential candidate 's tweets are received in particular parts of the United States. The top tweets are presented in vertical bar graphs that display the most popular tweet, and you can search for tweets with keyboards of specific issues. <p> Some of the results in well-known liberal and conservative states obviously show predictable skews, but in a toss-up state like Ohio, these tweets could show major turning points for voters active on Twitter. <h> If you 're always considering the possibilies... use The New York Times ' 512 Paths to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electoral college in battleground states effect the outcome of the polls? The New York Times 's 512 Paths to the White House widget tells you exactly how by offering you the opportunity to design your own path for Barack Obama or Mitt Romney 's road to winning the election. Instead of doing your own math, the app provides graphs that tell you how many ways a presidential candidate could win by narrowing down states that are still up for grabs. If you reside in one of these states, the app is a truly visual display of how you could be the game changer of the whole election. <h> If you want to show off your vote... use Foursquare 's I Voted app <p> Foursquare is n't just useful for finding local coffeeshops and bars, it 's also helpful for those searching for their local voting booths. The I Voted app provides information on what you need to vote on in your state, where you can go to cast your ballot, and gives you a Foursquare badge after you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've taken part in American democracy. You can also check back to the app after you 've voted to see how your local state is doing in comparison to the rest of America on a visual map, crowdsourced by Foursquare voters. <p> Technology policies are clearly important to you if you 're reading this, so use CrunchGov 's Policy Leaderboard to see which candidate 's previous actions have been beneficial to voters like yourself. With the Leaderboard, each candidate is ranked from a grade of A to F on how their votes in the White House have aligned with the consensus interests of the tech world. Completely against Stop Online Piracy Act( SOPA), you say? The leaderboard will tell you whether a candidate has backed that policy so you can stay far, far away from voting for him or her, or vice versa. <h> If you 're a political history junkie... use Electionary <p> If you 're looking for every kind of data possible on vote counts, history, and percentages down to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for iPad. You can use the app to search for particular cities and find out voting data for past elections to see how the county or state has changed( or not changed) overtime.
