5091241 <p> The best time to see the Leonid Meteor Shower is from 1 AM to twilight early Saturday morning( there could be a second minor peak early Tuesday morning). You could see as many as 5-15 meteors per hour. The meteors associated with the comet Tempel-Tuttle. It takes the comet about 33 years to make one orbit around the sun. The sky should be clear to partly cloudy and the crescent moon sets in mid-evening. Temperatures will likely be in the mid 20s to low 30s early Saturday, so it will be cool. The Leonids radiate from the constellation Leo, the Lion, which this time of year rises around local midnight, and by 3:00 a.m. is high in the eastern sky. So you 'd be best looking toward the east-northeast. Here 's a cool picture of the Leonids taken from space. <p> Sometimes its hard to say goodbye, its hard to wrap-up a story, luckily Director Bill Condon found a way to do both in " The Twilight Saga : Breaking Dawn -- Part 2?... its actually the best movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Warning to parents : " Breaking Dawn Part 2? is rated PG-13 for sequences of violence including disturbing images, some sensuality and partial nudity. But mostly for the fantasy violence that can be disturbing and gruesome. <p> " Breaking Dawn Part 2? poster courtesy Summit Entertainment <p>( My spoiler-free review) <p> " And all along.. I believed... I would find you... Time has brought... your heart to me... I... have loved you for a thousand... years " -- now Christina Perri 's song " A Thousand Years " -- the one that gets stuck in your head and wo n't let go -- finally makes sense in the context of the story. <p> Maybe its the big action sequence at the end of the movie or the early scenes with Bella learning her new found Vampire powers that makes it seem like Stephanie Meyer 's version of Xavier 's school for the gifted. There are many things I liked more about this chapter of the " Twilight " saga. <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of standing around and talking about what is going to happen, has happened, or will happen. Gone are all the angst -- thank you -- and a lot of " longing "... close ups and tracking shots around our main characters who are just staring off camera. We get moments of humor from different characters... but this time around, the audience is laughing more at the intended jokes than at the movie itself. <p> There are still several issues that keep this movie from entering any discussion of " best movies of 2012?... let 's start with the biggest elephant in the room : the CGI effects for baby Renesmee in the early scenes are ridiculous and distracting!! Its clear that a baby would not make faces like that... its clear that its CGI... it destroys the moment of " cuteness " and family bonding and replaces it with the " what the heck " feeling I had the first time I saw the talking baby commercials during the Super Bowl. <p> Let 's be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't read the books... but we still get a lot of adolescent dialogue and some of the acting is still a little stiff( Kellan Lutz as Emmett Cullen) or over-the-top( Michael Sheen as crazy/maniacal Aro). I feel like they and other characters could have had more depth and be more relatable if you make them more human... so much of this script/concept could have been punched up more and made stronger with a dedicated person, maybe a writer on the outside of this production. <p> I did like that there was considerably more action and less romance... although its still in there, just less of it... in a different, more grown up way. I love that Bella is not so mopey anymore. Edward and Jacob almost have this Han/Lando old buddies/rivals relationship going -- like they do n't completely trust each other -- but they know they need to for everything to work out. I also liked that the final climatic scenes are troubling -- putting the heroes in peril... as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main characters and seeing how they respond builds depth and makes the characters more interesting. <p> Many scenes towards the end are quite violent and **26;2777;TOOLONG action sequences -- as many death scenes are in supernatural fantasy movies -- that could be nightmarish for the younger ones. <p> The apparent twist ending had some fans in the audience gasping... but I thought it was interesting and refreshing for the Twilight series to do something slightly different. But do n't worry Twi-hards -- I 'm told its in the book -- you just have to kinda read between the lines and find it... and all the fans at the screening I attended did n't really have a problem with it. <p> Fans will love " Breaking Dawn Part 2?... its a solid way to wrap up the series. Including a video yearbook style montage just before the end credits set to( another reference) Christina Perri 's song " A Thousand Years ". It features a cast roll with names and images of all the characters from all 5 movies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice touch for the fans. <p> We 've never seen the 16th president of the United States in TV clips or even hear him in a radio broadcast... but Daniel-Day Lewis ' portrayal of Abraham Lincoln will now be the defining version of President Lincoln for me. <p> Warning to parents : " Lincoln " is rated PG-13 due to images related to war and death and some strong language. <p> " Lincoln " poster courtesy DreamWorks/ Touchstone Pictures <p>( My spoiler-free review) <p> " Lincoln " looks great and feels like we 're seeing life in the late 1800? s... both in sets, costumes, lighting, and dialogue. <p> Director Steven Spielberg does a very good job making interesting a storyline that we already know the ending to... Congress passing the Thirteenth Amendment in February 1865 -- abolishing slavery in the United States. <p> At its core, it plays out very much like a modern day political drama -- with many advisers and political allies weighing in on Presidential decisions. The backroom politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going through make the story interesting. Many of the characters look like Lincoln 's cabinet and the prominent politicians of the day seen in old photographs and paintings. <p> Day-Lewis ' Lincoln is slow, deliberate, and matter-of-fact... and so is the movie... it feels every bit of its 2 hours and 29 minute runtime. But its the movie version of history class... albeit a small slice of U.S. History... because we only get to experience a few months of his time as President. Through Day-Lewis we see how gifted a speaker and storyteller Lincoln was( afterall, his Gettysburg Address( 1863) is one of the most quoted speeches in American history). This Lincoln tells stories... he enjoys telling stories... and even pushes forward on a story after a grumpy Bruce McGill( as Edwin Stanton( Secretary of War)) exclaims " No! You 're not going to tell another story. " <p> Day-Lewis ' delivery and folksy persona help us understand why Lincoln was treasured by so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and determination to see the abolition of slavery. The years of political struggles and the war clearly took an emotional and physical toll on him. He is terrific as the beleaguered yet steadfast President driven by higher moral values, and perhaps political/military motivations. Much of his acting is done without words... its the look on his face, his stare while deep in thought, his smile, he appears tired and worn out, but still pushes on. Day-Lewis ' physical and vocal transformation into Lincoln are nothing short of award consideration, but his characterization of Lincoln 's warmth, charm and intellect are mesmerizing... he commands every scene.... worthy of an Oscar nomination in any year. <p> Lucky for us, he 's not alone.... supported by a very strong cast... typical for a Spielberg epic. Sally Field is Lincoln 's troubled wife Mary Todd Lincoln, who is dealing with the impact of years of political struggle, the war, and the lasting affects of a carriage accident. David Strathairn is Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wants to be the voice of political reason. Hal Holbrook brings instant credibility as influential politician Preston Blair, while Tommy Lee Jones acts his way out of a ridiculous wig as the powerful Republican politician Thaddeus Stevens( Rep. from Pennsylvania). James Spader and John Hawkes bring some comedic breaks as serious political operatives Mr. Bilbo and Mr. Latham. <p> Lee Pace as Fernando Wood( Democrat Rep. from New York), Michael Stuhlbarg as George Yeaman( Unionist Representative from Kentucky), Boris McGiver as Alexander Coffroth( Democrat Rep. from Pennsylvania), David Costabile as James Ashley( Republican Rep. from Ohio), and Tim Blake Nelson as Richard Schell( Representative from New York) bring to life the pivotal politicians involved in the debate about the 13th Amendment... the ones we may have read about in books and saw only in a few old black and white portraits. <p> Based on old photographs of Alexander Stephens( Vice President of the Confederate States), Jackie Earle Haley seemed born to play the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also seems a great fit as General Ulysses S. Grant, despite the small role. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Robert Lincoln the oldest son and Gulliver McGrath as youngest son Tad Lincoln fill a familiar Spielberg motif -- a strained father-son relationship and communication issues among family. <p> Unfortunately, my expectations were set very high due to my interest in the civil war as a child( after a visit to Gettysburg) and the director and cast involved in the movie. While that 's probably not fair to Mr. Spielberg to have my expectations set so high, my disappointments were mostly about what was not covered in this story -- not about the overall production of the movie. While intriguing, " Lincoln " is more important than traditionally entertaining but its epic feel and yet narrow scope will be sure to get it a lot of Oscar attention. <p> Picture shows low water level at Northport in Leelanau County, Michigan( USGS pic.). The water level of Lake Michigan has fallen 2 inches in the last month and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ago. Lake Michigan/Huron( they behave as one big lake for water level purposes, joined at the Mackinac Bridge) is 28? below the average water level and now one inch above the lowest level of the last 50 years back in 1964. Lake Superior is up one inch in the last month and 2? below the level of one year ago. Superior is 13? below the century average. Lake Erie is up 2? in the last month, but down 13? year-to-year. Lake Erie is 6? below the century average. Lake Ontario is down 1? in the last month and down 11? in the last year. Ontario is 9? below the long-term November average. According to this article, the low levels are " not out of the ordinary ". I would n't go that far. It is unusual, but not unprecedented to see a water level this low on Lake Michigan. Grand Rapids has had 30.84? of precipitation this year. That 's 91% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Last year we actually had above normal precipitation in Grand Rapids( 41.39?). Many people feel that dredging in the St. Clair River has contributed to the low lake levels. The low lake levels also affect lakes that connect to Lake Michigan( Macatawa, Spring, Muskegon, White). The Grand River in Grand Rapids is running at 85.3% of median flow right now. You can check Michigan river levels here. The some, the solution to the low water level of Lake Michigan is taxing kayaks! <p> Most all of the local teams have home games this weekend. Michigan( 7-3) hosts Iowa( 4-6) in the Big House at Noon. Michigan is favored and you can watch the game on ESPN. Northwestern( 7-3) at Michigan State( 5-5) could be the game of the day. That 's also a Noon start and the game is on ESPN2. At 1 PM, Miami( OH)( 4-6) takes on Central Michigan 4-6) in Mt. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( 4-7) tangle in Kalamazoo at 2 PM. Wake Forest( 5-5) has a tough road game at Notre Dame( 10-0). The Fighting Irish have a tougher match against USC( 7-3) out in Los Angeles next Saturday night. You can catch the Notre Dame/Wake Forest game on WOOD-TV at 3:30 PM. I 'll also add that my alma mater, Wisconsin( 7-3) -- has a big game against Ohio State( 10-0). Wisconsin 's 3 losses have come by only 3 points each and with home field advantage, that could be a close game. That game will be on WOTV4 at 3:30 PM. We also have the high school playoff games on Saturday. Sunday the Detroit Lions( 4-5) host the Green Bay Packers( 6-3) on FOX at 1 PM. The weather should be pleasant and dry for all of these games with temperatures in the low-mid 50s. Skies should be partly to mostly sunny for most games in the Great Lakes region. <p> UPDATE : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. First picture of the Northern Lights( Aurora Borealis) taken around 10:15 PM Tuesday night at Millennium Park on the SW side of G.R. by Pete Mumbower. Second picture is from Randy DeKilder in Hickory Corners. Click the pictures to enlarge. If you look here at spaceweather.com, you can scroll down on the left side and see the kp index. If that 's a 5 you might be able to see them faintly to the north with a naked eye away from city lights. It 's at a 6 as I write this at 11:20 PM. Check out the NOAA Aurora Page and also this page. Here 's another site to check out. Check out this picture of the Northern Lights from Monday in Lulea, Sweden. More images here. An interplanetary shock wave( probably the leading edge of a Coronal Mass Ejection) hit Earth 's magnetic field on Monday at approximately 7 PM EST. <p> Cool and dry weather will prevail the rest of this week. We 'll see partly-to-mostly sunny skies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly moderate from the low 40s tomorrow( Wed.) to the low 50s over the weekend. Average high temperatures are now in the upper 40s. Today 's high of 38 was the coolest high temperature since last March 30th. Light winds over the next several days will make the days feel more comfortable. Snowfall Monday night ranged from a trace to 1.2? with most areas getting a dusting. Up north, 3? fell at E. Jordan, 3.5? near Cheboygan and in the U.P., 6? was reported at Winona, 5.8? at Alston and 5.2? at Pelkie.( image from WLUC) <p> Temperature departures from average thru the first 13 days of November : Grand Rapids -1.7, Battle Creek -2.4, Kalamazoo -2.8. After a wet October, we 're back to a dry pattern here in November, with just 0.27? of precipitation so far. <p> 11:10 AM. There 's still a few flakes on radar, so we 'll leave the radar up top of the blog... nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( Visible -- daytime). You can see the lake-effect clouds overhead. If Lake Michigan were not there, we 'd be clear now. We 'll eventually become partly cloudy and then mostly clear as temperatures warm a bit aloft and the temperature difference from water to air is minimized, and the wind will eventually turn light to the south-southeast tonight, so it wo n't be coming off the lake. It 'll be a cool day with temperatures stuck in the 30s. The last day when we did n't reach 40 was March 30th. A couple of spots in E. Muskegon and Newaygo Co. reported about an inch of snow on the grass overnight. The overall airmass will be dry and other factors just do n't line up for a heavier lake-effect event that we might otherwise see when air this cold comes across Lake Michigan in mid-late November. Much of the rest of the coming week will be cool, dry and rather tranquil. <p> Hope you enjoyed the relatively warm weekend. ' The high temperature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average, but still not up to the record high of 73 for 11/11. Despite the warm weekend, the average temperature for Nov. 2012 is still 1.6 degrees cooler than average. Our 57-degree reading at 12:01 AM this morning will be seven degrees above average for today( 11/12), so today will look like a warm day in the climate record. Here 's the GRR NWS discussion. Gale Warnings remain up for Lake Michigan thru Tuesday morning. I got a quick peak at the overnight European model data. It takes the 850 mb temperature to -12.2C Tuesday AM -- that 's cold, and will provide quite the contrast with the relatively warm Lake Michigan waters( near 50). The average wind speed on Sunday was 17.8 mph in G.R.
