5040941 <p> Seventy-five thousand reservists in Israel have been called up for whatever Israel has planned for Gaza. It 's been bombarding it for three days and has asserted to the world that it must continue to respond to rocket attacks from Hamas because Israel can not tolerate such terrorism. Yet, when one examines the collective punishment imposed upon the people of Gaza, it is clear that there is no equivalency between the power of Hamas to terrorize Israeli civilians and the power of Israel to terrorize Palestinian civilians. <p> Hamas has committed crimes and abuses. Its rocket attacks are mostly inaccurate and, because they lack precision, they are widely considered to be war crimes. <p> The OSCE is a body, which the United States is a founding member. Observers have been sent to the United States to observe US elections since 2002. But, now, Republicans in states where voter suppression could potentially occur are suggesting to Americans these people are here to violate American sovereignty as part of some left-wing ACORN conspiracy. <p> The United Nations special rapporteur for counterterrorism will lead an inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, to determine whether the strikes violate international human rights and humanitarian laws. <p> WikiLeaks editor-in-chief Julian Assange addressed members of the United Nations at an event with Ecuador Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino and Center for Constitutional Rights legal director Baher Azmy. He spoke to members on the current status of his asylum case and how the United States currently is engaged in a wide investigation into members of WikiLeaks and others, who the US believes to be connected. <p> Does he look like a person the US would target? Is he a militant? Such is the nightmare that is the US drone war. And it enjoys the support of both candidates running for president, especially President Barack Obama himself, who said today in front of the United Nations, " Understand America will never retreat from the world. We will bring justice to those who harm our citizens and our friends, and we will stand with our allies. " <p> The Obama campaign has responded by saying that the President is a strong supporter of ethanol as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Iowa at the time. But even if you support ethanol -- and studies show the corn-based version costs us more in energy to harvest than it 's worth -- you can not deny the economic harm created by the mandate at this time, given the drought conditions. The price spikes have caused a severe hardship for livestock producers in particular who use corn to feed their animals. The head of the UN 's food program, Jose Graziano da Silva, also called for a suspension of the ethanol mandate. <p> Here 's a classic case of what 's good for the US being terrible for the rest of the world. That typically does not lead to good outcomes for the world. Corn-based ethanol fails on its own merits. The energy used in production far exceeds the energy savings from using ethanol over fossil fuel-based energy. The biofuel standards could be reached by less invasive sources like switchgrass and other natural sources. Converting so much corn into fuel at a time of a massive corn shortage makes no sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a third straight day, the most sustained challenge to the seat of power of President Bashar al-Assad. The Syrian government has escalated their response as a
