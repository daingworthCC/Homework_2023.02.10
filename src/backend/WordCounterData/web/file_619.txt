5088841 <h> $ 33.00 <p> Be Courageous and Write was inspired by a quote from friend and author Holley Gerth. Holley and I both write for a website called( in) courage, and once she said in an email to the site authors, " Be courageous and try to write in a way that scares you a little. " Well, that actually scared me a little, but I 've never forgotten it and it prompts me to dig deeper and write in a more meaningful way. I hope it inspires you, too. <p> This 8 " x 8 " photographic print has been treated with a matte coating and linen texture and is mounted on a 3/4 " standout board with black edging. The lightweight backing is equipped with holes on the back side, ready for hanging. <p> Be Courageous and Write is the third in a series of five prints in the Create set, available individually or as a set. <p> Click the image to enlarge.
