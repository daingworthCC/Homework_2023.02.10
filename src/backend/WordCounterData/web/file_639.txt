5090841 <p> You can read all the blogging advice in the world, but none of it matters unless you take action. <p> To set your blog up to be a massive success, you have to ruthlessly focus your efforts on things that work, and stop spending precious time on things that do n't. <p> Today I 'm going to make it easier for you to take the action you need to take to make your blog better. All you have to do is set aside 10 or 15 or 60 minutes to tackle one of the 21 simple steps below. <p> The more you complete, the more progress you 'll make. <p> You 've probably already completed some of these, but I guarantee you have n't done all of them. If you have completed all of ' em, please tell me in the comments. Better yet, share one of your own extra tips. <p> Update : We 've specifically created a 13-week course for people trying to successfully launch their own blog and have massive success. How to Start a Blog That Matters can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the lives of your readers. <h> Action #1 : Start Building an Email List( 20-30 minutes) <p> Why this is important : If you are n't building an email list, you 're missing out on the most powerful and consistent way to drive repeat visitors and customers to your website or blog. With an email list, you become less and less dependent on external sources of traffic, and gain more ability to interact with your blog 's audience. <p> Create a sign-up form for your email list. Use these instructions for AWeber or MailChimp. <p> Put your sign-up form on your blog, both in the sidebar and on your about page. <p>( optional) Offer a free giveaway for people who subscribe to your list. Offering a workbook or an ebook or video series( or even a whole toolbox of resources) can drive many more signups than not offering something. <p> Do n't wait to start your email list. The sooner you do this, the faster your list and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list, you can create forms and ask people to sign up for email updates like this : enter your email below to get updates from Think Traffic and access to the subscriber-only toolbox of resources : <p> That took me 30 seconds to add to this post and now I 'll get more email subscribers <h> Action #2 : Start a Post Ideas Journal( 10 Minutes) <p> The best ideas for blog posts do n't always come while you 're sitting down to write. Try keeping a simple journal of blog post ideas so you do n't miss out on the best opportunities. <p> You can write this in a Google Doc, an old-fashioned notebook or by starting a quick draft in WordPress for each idea. <p> It does n't matter how you do it, the point is just to keep a running list to work from. <h> Action #3 : Add Facebook " Like " Buttons( 15 to 20 minutes) <p> People who visit your site represent a massive marketing opportunity. If your visitors like what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their friends, but usually only if you make it easy. <p> Configure your Like Buttons as you wish. The page will show you how they 'll look on the fly as you make changes. <p> Copy the code Facebook provides. <p> Paste the code into your blog posts, anywhere you want the button to appear. <p>( optional) If you 're up for the challenge( or if you have a tech person), you can add the Like Button to all of your posts, either at the beginning or end of each post, or both. This will require editing some PHP files for your WordPress theme, and the specific instructions depend on which theme or platform you 're using. Here are sample instructions for the Thesis theme. <p> While we 're at it, if you like this post, I will love you forever for clicking the like button here : <h> Action #4 : Add Twitter Retweet Buttons( 15 to 20 minutes) <p> Twitter is another huge potential source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of visitors every month from Twitter, and it takes very little time to gain those benefits. <p> The method for adding a retweet button to your blog is pretty much the same as adding Like Buttons above. First you 'll need to head over to the Twitter Retweet Button configuration page( I actually prefer the TweetMeme retweet button because it seems a little more accurate). In either case you 'll want to copy the code provided for your configured button and paste it into your posts( or optionally add it to every post by modifying your theme files). <h> Action #5 : Make a List of Every Blogger in Your Niche( 30 minutes) <p> Whatever you blog about, chances are there are other people who blog on the same topic. Your job is to become friends with as many of your fellow bloggers as possible. <p> Why would you want to become friends with your " competition? " <p> It 's simple. In every niche I 've studied, the bloggers who succeed fastest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out, instead of trying to protect turf. Do n't think of other bloggers in your space as competitors, they 're actually your best chance of making your blog a massive success. <p> The strategy is simple : make a list of everyone who blogs on similar topics to you. Do n't just include a-listers. Include your peers and up-and-comers as well. Now prioritize the list based on who you think you 'd naturally hit it off with. <p> If you blog in a huge niche, this does n't really need to include everyone who blogs on the topic. If you blog in a tiny niche, you might want to expand a little beyond your space. <p> Making the list is the first step. Next comes the real work. Make it your goal to reach out and create genuine relationships with as many people on the list as possible. <h> Action #6 : Add Social Proof to Your Blog( 15 minutes) <p> Social proof is a powerful influencer. When people see that other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that thing themselves. If they see lots of people are subscribed to your blog, they 'll be more likely to subscribe as well. <p> You have to be careful though. Social proof only works when the numbers are impressive. Showing new visitors that 23 people are subscribed to your site probably wo n't drive new subscribers. In fact, it might actually repel people( social proof works both ways). <p> If your blog is established, you might be able to show RSS or email subscriber numbers, or monthly readers. If your blog is new, you might want to show Twitter follower numbers( Twitter followers tend to be easier to come by), Facebook fan page subscribers or something else that looks more impressive. You might also simply need to wait until you have something with enough momentum to display. <p> How to add social proof to your site in 15 minutes : <p> Decide on which form of social proof to display( use whichever seems more impressive -- avoid numbers less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displaying RSS subscribers or Twitter followers is a good option. <p> To add an RSS subscriber count, you 'll want to use either Feedburner or some other service that keeps track of your subscriber count. In your Feedburner account, look for the FeedCount link under the " Publicize " tab. <p> Once you have your Twitter or RSS widget configured, you need to copy the code provided and put it somewhere on your site. An easy place to put your widget is the sidebar of your blog. Just add a new text widget and paste the code in there. <p> Once you 've identified your " special sauce, " you need to communicate it to your visitors. Do this either through your tagline, in your sidebar, in your about page or within your blog posts. You 'll probably want to explain your USP in several of those places, and remind your visitors regularly. <h> Action #8 : Learn SEO Basics( 60 minutes) <p> Why this is important : Search engine optimization( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour to learn and a lifetime to master. By just learning the basics, you can set yourself up to take advantage of a ton of opportunities over the coming months and years for your blog. <h> Action #9 : Implement a Call to Action( 5 minutes) <p> The best way to get visitors to take a particular action is to explicitly ask them to. This is known as a call to action. <p> Want more email subscribers? Ask people to subscribe. <p> Want more retweets of your post? Ask people to retweet. <p> Try this in your next post. Ask your readers to do something you want them to do. If your content is good and you 've provided genuine value, some of your readers will be happy to help you out. Just ask politely and try different tactics to see what works best for your audience. <p> Once you dial in your call to action technique, make a habit of using a call to action whenever you want your visitors to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stuff( 15 minutes) <p> When someone comes to your site, you need to put your best foot forward. The easiest way to do this is to link to some of your best posts in your sidebar or within a special " start here " page that you link to from your main navigation menu. <p> How you determine which posts are your best is up to you. You could show your most linked to posts, your most commented posts, your most viewed posts or something else. You could hand pick the posts you think best represent what your blog is all about. <h> Action #11 : Take Down the Ads( 5 minutes) <p> When your blog is new, one of the worst things you can do is to plaster advertisements all over the place. If your blog is small, those ads wo n't earn you more than a few bucks, but could be costing you big. You 'll turn off readers and stunt your growth during your critical formative months. <p> Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucks? <p> Once your site is bigger, you can start to introduce advertisements if you really want to in a tasteful and relevant way. Better yet, use a more effective way of earning income from your blog like affiliate marketing or consulting or developing your own products. <p> For now, take down the ads and focus on growth. <h> Action #12 : Develop a Facebook Fan Page( 60 minutes) <p> I already mentioned above that Facebook has 500 million registered users. In addition to adding " like " buttons to your posts, you should also consider setting up a Facebook fan page for your site. <p> The Think Traffic fan page has over 1250 members and is a top 10 referring site here. I 've done very little to publicize the fan page and it does n't take much time to maintain. <p> I 'm not an expert on Facebook pages by any means, but luckily my friend Pat Flynn from the Smart Passive Income blog has written an excellent Blogger 's Guide to Facebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to know about how bloggers can use Facebook. If you 're in a hurry and just want to learn how to set up your fan page, start with his 6-minute video on how to set up a page. <p> Even if you do n't plan to completely build out your Facebook fan page now, set one up sooner than later so readers who prefer connecting via Facebook can. At a minimum you can simply add an entry any time you write a new blog posts. Eventually you can expand the page to build community and interact with your members in a deeper way. <p> Why this is important : outposts are an important concept in blogging. Your blog is your central platform, but outposts like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc. can help you find and interact with new readers where they already hang out. <p> The key to making the best use of outposts is to get in the habit of updating them regularly. If you have multiple outposts you might want to focus on just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular updates. You need to make regular updates to show your visitors you 're committed to the platform and that you 'll be providing additional value there. <p> How to commit to updating your outpost regularly : <p> Set a reminder on your calendar at first to update your outpost every day. <p> Study examples of other blogs( preferably in your space) which have a thriving outpost. Observe the types of content they post, how they interact with members, and the frequency of posts. <p> Make sure you do n't just treat your outpost as a glorified RSS feed( where you post only links to your recent blog posts). If you want your external community to thrive, you need to provide extra value. <h> Action #14 : Try a New Content Format( 90 minutes) <p> If you 're only writing similarly formatted blog posts, you might be missing out on some big opportunities. For example, maybe your audience prefers video over written content. Maybe you 're better at producing audio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be writing quick inspirational Seth Godin style posts instead of your usual standard 800 word posts. <p> Whatever format you 've been using for blog posts, here is my challenge for you : get out of your comfort zone and try something completely new. <p> Choose from a format on the following list that you 've never tried before : <p> Video <p> Audio <p> E-Books <p> Workbooks <p> 2000 words or more <p> 400 words or less <p> Interviews <p> It does n't matter what you choose, the point is to get used to trying different content types. You need to find out whether your audience responds better to something you have n't tried, or if you 're better at producing certain types you have n't tried before. <p> Start with one new type now, and come back here later to try additional new types. <h> Action #15 : Check Your Mindset <p> Why are you blogging? There are lots of valid reasons for blogging, but there 's one reason that has to be at the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success. <p> You have to want to help or entertain people( or both). <p> If you do n't help or entertain, why should someone read your site? Your blog needs to solve problems, address needs, fulfill desires and enlighten or inspire. Whatever personal reasons you have for blogging need to take a back seat to delivering value to your target audience. <p> How to check your mindset in 10 minutes : <p> Write down all the goals you have for your blog( money, fame, recognition, and anything else that comes to mind). <p> Write down why you chose this particular topic to blog about. <p> Write down why you are uniquely qualified to blog on your topic. <p> Now check your answers. If one of your goals is n't to help your readers, you should reevaluate your motivations and topic. If you did n't choose your topic because you really care about it, you should reevaluate your motivations and topic. If you are n't specially qualified to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and topic. <h> Action #16 : Write a Rant <p> Why this is important : common views yield common results. If you want to grow faster than everyone else in your space, you need unique views and bold opinions. When you feel strongly about something, you 'll make an impression on and form stronger relationships with your readers. <p> How to write a constructive rant in 60 minutes : <p> The key here is to write a constructive rant, not just any rant. You want to write about something that could be improved or thought of in a better way. <p> Think about the topic you blog about. What bothers you about the conventional wisdom? What do you think everyone is thinking but no one is saying? <p> Make sure this is something you 're actually passionate about, do n't just choose a view counter to common opinion simply because it 's different. You want your passion to show in the post. <p> Write your post in a stream of consciousness to begin with. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of while you 're writing to let the emotion come through. <p> Watch the reaction to your post. If it is n't well received, do n't be discouraged. Try another topic next time. <p> When you 're just starting out, you do n't need to have all the answers. Your visitors do n't expect you to, and you need to give yourself time to find your voice and form your opinions. <p> During the early stages, it can help to think of yourself as a facilitator instead of as an expert. Your job is to bring great information to your audience instead of creating all of it yourself. <p> Interviewing someone influential in your niche can be a great way to bring useful content to your audience. Interviewing an expert also helps by associating you with the expert in the minds of your readers. It also helps you create a relationship with the interviewee and potentially to borrow the interviewee 's audience if he or she links to your interview. <p> Shooting from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little planning can help you produce much better content, and more importantly, much more consistent content. <p> How to plan your content for maximum results : <p> Block out 30 minutes on your calendar each week. I like to do this on Monday, but the day does n't really matter. <p> During this time, review and update your post ideas journal from above. <p> Keep a running list of post types you that have been effective for you in the past. For example, I keep post categories like " interviews, " " ask the readers, " " monthly reports, " " writing epic shit " and so on. Look back at previously successful posts for ideas for new posts. <p> Make a tentative plan for posts you 'll write over the coming week and month. This is n't set in stone, but it will help you each time you sit down to write if you have ideas ready. <h> Action #19 : Ask for an Outside Point of View( 60 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time, it becomes hard to see things as other people see them. To become a successful blogger, you 'll need plenty of help from friends and colleagues along the way to help you see things through fresh eyes. <p> Try asking a friend, colleague or consultant for a quick critique on a blog post, your about page, your design, your branding or anything else you suspect might need to be refreshed or revised. The ultimate goal is to make a habit of doing this whenever you feel stuck or stale. <p> The bonus to this action is that it gives you an excuse to reach out to a fellow blogger and form a stronger bond. Offer to help by returning the critique service whenever your colleague needs it. <h> Action #20 : Ask Your Readers <p> Building community around your blog is a great way to make your readers feel appreciated and committed to your success. <p> Your posts do n't have to be the only things that deliver value at your site. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of your content and encouraging your visitors to interact. Those interactions can lead to other opportunities for your readers outside of your site. <p> Comments can also be a great way for you to learn about opportunities for new content and products. <p> If you want more comments for your site, you need to do a few things. First, write about topics that have multiple possible right answers. Second, write in a way that leaves the door open to discussion( do n't force your readers to agree or disagree with you, it stifles comments). Third, and most importantly, you need to ask for your readers ' opinions. <p> I like to do this with formal " ask the readers " segments here about once a month. You can run a series like that at your own blog, or simply ask your readers for comments at the end of your posts. <p> Either way, just make sure you ask. <h> Action #21 : Get Some Accountability( 60 minutes) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staying motivated and staying committed to your blog long enough to see success. <p> One of the best ways to ensure you stay motivated is to become accountable to others. When you know other people are expecting certain things from you, <p> How to get some accountability for your blog : <p> Decide where you 'd like to be held accountable. There are three possibilities I recommend : a formal mastermind group, a blogging forum or your own blog. <p> To join a formal mastermind group, you 'll need to find two or three other people to participate, or find an existing group that needs a new member. <p> To use a blogging forum for accountability, you 'll need to find a suitable forum. Problogger has an inexpensive forum that could work for this purpose. Traffic School also has forums where people are holding themselves accountable. <p> To use your own blog for accountability, you 'll just need to announce your goals on a regular basis in a special blog post series( see my monthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's annual goal setting post) <p> Whatever you decide, the principles are the same : regularly announce your goals for a set timeframe( weekly, bi-weekly or monthly is best). With each announcement you should also review your performance during the prior period. <p> You can of course try to hold yourself accountable privately, but public accountability is much more effective at driving action. It 's easier to opt out when you do n't have people waiting to hear your results. <p> -- <p> The key to making many of the actions above work for you is consistency. Many of them need to become habit before you 'll experience maximum benefits, but taking the recommended actions above will get you started. <p> You do n't have to do everything on this list, just pick the ones that you think will work best for you. <p> The key is to take action. Try something above and let me know how it works for you. Most items above only take 30 minutes or less. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear it in the comments. <p> If you liked this post, please share it on Facebook, Twitter or StumbleUpon. <p> I learned a tremendous amount from reading this. Unfortunately, I am at the office of one of my corporate clients right now, and Facebook/Twitter are blocked from this location. I will therefore share this post when I get home. <p> Question : I 've been thinking of doing the mastermind thing for a while now, but unfortuantely, I ca n't seem to find any bloggers in my area with whom I can network. The few other bloggers I 've found are very casual with their writing, and not really interested in developing their audience. <p> Do you have any suggestions on how to locate/create a mastermind group where none seem to exist? Do you know of a website that has a virtual mastermind group? <p> So regarding mastermind groups, I 've been involved in a couple of groups where we are n't all in the same location. We just talk on Skype @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well, and it opens up your possibilities to a wider group of people. <p> To find people, I have generally just reached out to bloggers I admire to get to know them. If it seems like a good fit, ask some of them if they 'd like to join your group. Start with one and grow the group as you find new candidates. <p> I too agree with Joe. This is the finest post covering almost everything to be a successful online entrepreneur. <p> I would like to add few more points in this list : 1) Watch out successful bloggers in your niche and follow their strategy of success. Find what works for them and try to implement on your blog. Do n't just copy them blindly but tweak their strategy your way and success is yours!!!! <p> I 'm also very interested in masterminding. My blog 's traffic has really increased in the last 2 months, plus I 've just launched a new membership site, so if you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Nice post Corbett. I like how you break down each of these important actions and the ETA on how long it will take to complete each step is a really nice touch. You definitely GIVE in this post. Thank you! <p> Fantastic resource Corbett. I copied the entire post into my planner so I can do one action per day. I suspect some of them will take longer than suggested( usually takes me hours to write a post or think about my mission) but great ideas nonetheless. Cheers. <p> I started taking notes and got as far as wanting to say how #5 was a good one for me and worked really well, and continues to work, and also how #10 is really important and actually it is because of your starting point that I was inspired to do the same -- and then I got lost in the massive depth of knowledge and insight that this post provided. <p> I think you need to add this to your ' New Here, Start with These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool, I 'm glad some of these have worked for you already Alex. I agree, #5( making a list of bloggers in your niche) is really important. Relationships are the best way to grow your blog, hands down. <p> I just did a post about using Tumblr as a means to store blog ideas or bits of inspiration. A lot of times these little ideas are n't good enough for a full blown post, but it can be the spark you need when you 're itching for creativity. <p> Nice idea, David! Coincidentally, I 've been toying with the idea of turning my Tumblr( currently collecting dust) into a true " side blog " for those little ideas that are n't quite meaty enough to make a " real ' blog post, but too good to let slide... sort of a combo of Corbett 's #13( Update Outposts) and #14( New Content Format) items? Thanks for this great list, Corbett -- just the kick I needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally useless but I must say AWESOME POST!! Fortunately I already implemented or am implementing the things you describing, but the quantity and the quality of this post are absolutely excellent! <p> Wow Corbett this is an epic post. The is a great reference point for bloggers/traffic builders new and old. <p> As you said " The key is to take action. " The fact is thought that many people may know this stuff, but how many actually act on it. 99% do n't follow through. I urge everyone to be the 1% who puts this stuff in to action and reaps the rewards. <p> Some of these have been on my mind a lot lately -- #12, #13 and #14 especially. I 'm definitely guilty about not putting enough effort into social networking tools like Facebook and Twitter, so hopefully this will be a good kick in the pants for me. <p> For sure this is your most practical post yet and I needed to read it and see these steps again, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking some time. I ca n't get caught in the ' traffic ' portion of it but ' traffic creep ' is always there. <p> I just need to focus the words, theres been a rant festering for the last 3 days and I am gon na blast it. <p> Hey Diego, great questions. I choose to offer RSS through Feedburner and email updates via AWeber. I did start with the Feedburner email subscription option at my other blog, but found it was n't flexible enough for what I wanted to do( for example, the " traffic toolbox " concept I offer here). The important thing is that you offer email subscriptions and start building your list. How you do it depends on what you hope to achieve. <p> Corbett, you 're always full of surprises.. a " home run post ", yet again. You should write a book on traffic building, not just an eBook -- A BOOK. <p> By the way, have you experimented with Feedblitz or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of experiences have you had? There seem to be a lot of good buzz going on about the prior and given that I have n't been completely satisfied( quite the opposite actually..) with Feedburner, I 'd love to hear your thoughts on some of the alternatives. <p> Here 's a post idea for you( if you have a post like this already, please regard this and give me a hint where to find it : How to Really engage with your blog 's audience through your RSS feed. That would be an interesting read! <p> In every niche I 've studied, the bloggers who succeed fastest are the ones who band together and help each other out, instead of trying to protect turf. Do n't think of other bloggers in your space as competitors, they 're actually your best chance of making your blog a massive success. <p> This is a great point! When I was first starting out, I 'd get really jealous when I discovered somebody who was already doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example, Jen Gresham of Everyday Bright and Stacy Curnow of Midwife for your Life both made me mad with jealousy. But I started talking to them, and they 're both super nice. To my total surprise, they 've both ended up sending me a lot traffic. Jen gives a great perspective on this in her post Dare to be Similar on Everyday Bright. That 's what made me stop seeing similar blogs as stomping on my attempted purple cow and start seeing them as potential allies. Much better! <p> Hey Cara, thanks for the note. You 're right that the video is outdated, but the link you provided is about landing pages, not the Facebook fan page itself. Anyway, I updated the link above. Here 's the correct video from Pat : <p> Yeah.. uniqueness is a kind of resource for your site and mailing list is a tool which let them to be with your site after you impressed them with your uniqueness. What we need now is to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have! <p> Tip #22 : Print out these suggestions and place them in your blogging workspace! <p> Thanks Corbett! The suggestions are detailed and the estimated times help remind me that each step is within reach.( Also, a big thanks to @adamsinger for suggesting this post) looking forward to exploring your other thoughts/suggestions! <p> Thanks there are some really good pointers in here for new bloggers, I have been going around 3 months now and a lot of the stuff I already do but some of the suggestions on here sound really useful and hopefully they will bring more traffic to my site. <p> Yes Cindy, I feel the same way. In fact, getting an accountability partner( or small mastermind group) might be the most important item on the list, because it will help you achieve all the other items. <p> Thanks so much for that informative post. You gave so many more unique suggestions than I 've seen in the past -- the rant seems like it could be done tactfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing is brilliant. Lists like these seem like common sense sometimes, but hearing the reinforcement and the encouragement is so helpful when you 're just starting out like me. Thank you so much! @allinspections &; allinspections.com/blog can surely benefit from this. <p> The one thing I have discovered over the last couple of years that most people seem to have nothing different to say about building an online presence. I have just finished reading this post and I am inspired and will go home now and make a start on this list. I am lucky if I get 40 page views per day. reading this post has renewed my flagging vigour <p> Great post, great post, great post Corbett! I 'm glad that I 'm doing some of these for now. I definitely will be implementing most very soon especially like the one about making a list of all those in my niche and interviewing someone influencial. Thanks for the post <p> You had me after the first two sentences, Corbett. Taking that advice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference for most bloggers. Then you get to the actual post, and WOW! This is a must read for any blogger. <p> There are still some items on this list that I could benefit from reexamining myself, and I have yet to do #16 or #17. Definitely a post worth bookmarking and refer back to time and time again. <p> Great list. Makes me realize the actions I am not taking and really need to start doing. In particular, new types of posts I have n't done before like video and 2000 word posts. Lots of work but well worth it! Suzanne <p> I love how you started your post with " none of it matters unless you take action. " That is so true!! As I read through the post, I often thought, " I know I should do that, but I have n't gotten around to it. " Knowing what to do or having an idea is only half of it -- you have to do it. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've ever read in the blogosphere. It 's HUGE and contains lots of informations <p> To me, Action #3 is the best. More and more people prefer to " like " than to share a specific link to their friends. This will surefire boost up your traffic and raise people 's awareness of your website BTW, I think it takes only 3 minutes to complete that task <p> Thanks for the great information. I do n't understand the difference between adding a retweet button if you have a twitter button. Is there a major difference or a reason why I should use on over the other? <p> You only need one of the buttons, they serve the same purpose. I found that the TweetMeme button is more accurate and less prone to delays and outages( when it comes to tweet counts). The counts are important as social proof. Otherwise both buttons do the same thing. <p> Hi there, Found your site while browsing and am happy to report that I managed to get my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit technically challenged so it too a while but Pat 's videos were a great help. Just need to figure out how to link my blog to the page so that it posts automatically whenever I update. <p> This is such great information -- unfortunately, I seem to be tech challenged. I really want to use the Like button option, but ca n't get it to work. The code shows on the post, not the button. Not sure what I did wrong or where to fix it. Any suggestions? Thanks, Amy <p> I 'm new to your website and this is a pretty impressive first post to read. I 've already checked off some of the items you mention but there is still more I can do. Right now I 'm off to see what tips you have for connecting with other bloggers in my niche. <p> Wow! Great post! You have made me look at my website in a completely different manner. It 's definitely time for a re-evaluation. I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near future. Thanks again! <p> P.S This is the first post I have read on your blog, and It will keep my coming back for more <p> This is really awesome Corbett. Ya, indeed the format, structure and title does affect and make a post go viral. Understand it, and it 's a big hit for our blog. Anyway, gon na apply these tips especially those I 'm yet to build like e-mail list. Yet to start because not really know what to write and how people people would subscribe for it. Will research deeper on that. Thanks again for the awesome post Corbett. <p> Thanks for writing this post man! I picked up several nice tips to implement. I just started a new blog recently and one of these I want to implement is the Rant post. Also working on a testing series on triggers. Planning on doing some real life experiments on social triggers that influence and revealing my stats and results. Should be fun! <p> Excellent list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you suggested here. <p> My favorites are #16,19 and 20. I have been thinking about writing a post asking my readers what they would like to see on my blog, but it had slipped my mind until I read your post today. Thanks for the reminder. <p> One question ; I know that there are plugin 's out there that do some of the things you suggest, like adding retweet and FB like buttons to each post. Is there a reason you do n't suggest these plugins, instead of trying to install with code? <p> Hey. Epic. So epic that it did not force me to think, it forced me to take action. So I sat down one fine afternoon( of today!), and ticked off ALL 21 Quick Actions. One Sitting. I wrote a post about it While I was taking the actions. <p> Thank you for providing the inspiration, Mr Barr. And good luck with the Hustle! <p> I 've been putting off Aweber for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's #1 means of building/promoting their brand. This is a great post and provides plenty of inspiration in itself... Thanks Darren Sproat <p> Thanks for the very long article, I had better leave now or else my wife will kick my butt for spending too long on my computer. Anyway back to reverence, I have just started a new blog and think this list is great so I will be back tomorrow to see what I can add to my new blog to make it great. I have my second blog post ready so tomorrow I will give it one last check then publish. All the best Paul <p> I am printing this post and using it as my to-do list. I think when I am done I will have a much better blog. Right now I know it needs lots of work! Thanks for a great resource.( and FYI, I did click on the FaceBook like button when asked!) <p> I just printed this, along with the post you based it on( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both posts, and gon na keep them handy, I only had time to read the first 4 actions or so on each, but loved what I 've seen so far. <p> #1 E-mail subscribers sure is a good idea, even better if you offer ' subscribers only ' feature. Though there are minuses to these, such as some people may want to keep their anonymity and might not want to give out their e-mail, and some might be thinking of getting spammed if the site is not well-known by them. <p> #9 I do n't agree with this, asking them, would be the wrong for me. Instead of asking, I would try offering them something. Things like " If you become our subscriber... " <p> Great post, i 've been abit slow on the mailing list point which is numero uno on your list. Aweber seems to be getting good reviews -- i 'm gon na give it a try. I believe mailchimp has limit on the no of subscribers on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spend time every day learning something new. You have given me so many great ideas. I plan on implementing at least one of these ideas each day until I get the hang of this. Thanks for such a great post! <p> Incredible info. This post was included in A-List Blog Marketing 's : 10 Posts Every Serious Blogger Should Read. I 'm re-vamping my blog and have just made tons of notes. Will be checking out the additional resources you recommended. Thank you! <p> Hi Corbett. I love this post and have come back to it a few times now to implements a few new things at a time( slow and stead wins the race...). I have probably nailed about 13 of them and am planning to focus on 5 and 14 next... I also have a develeoper doing some tweaking of my site which will cover 2-3 other points. <p> It is always good to hear and read things we know we should do but do n't always complete the list as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journal. I have started one a time or two but never kept it going. Reading this just may change that. <p> I just re-visited this post( and almost certainly will again) to make sure I was either doing or on track for the majority of the points above. I use sharebar for my like &; tweet buttons because I actually prefer these to be out of the way of the content. I flip between switching these on and off as I sometimes think people are tired of seeing like buttomns everywhere( somehow I think this more for like buttons than for tweet buttons). <p> In terms of social proof, for a new blog I have OK numbers on my homepage so I think it 's OK but mostly 0? s on other pages with the odd 1s &; 2s. I kind of like the idea that people who visit the homepage for the first time will get some social proof from the tweets and likes( 77 &; 123 at the moment) but not sure if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other pages having very low scores. <p> Would your advice be to remove this then? i.e. are 0? s that damaging? <p> I may take a look at the coding option you mention above. I also use shareaholics widget but the like &; tweet buttons on that come out in really strange positions which looks awkward and amateurish( in my view) <p> Wow, great compilation Corbett! I am definitely bookmarking this one, as a relatively new blogger and digger deeper into social media. I am finding Buffer to be a huge help in terms of maintaining my Twitter outpost, both to get the word out about my own blog posts and to share valuable information with others. <p> Thanks a lot for this post. Noobs like me need long and strong lists like this in order to survive the big jungle of bloggers. I have noted down your tips and have already improved my blog while reading the list! With the ranting, you 've inspired me and I 'm off to draft a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my everyday life! Thanks again and good job. <p> Thanks for sharing this resource Corbett. Excellent detailed breakdown to help stay focused. Even though I 've been at this blogging thing for some time in one form or another, it really helps to ensure time is well spent. <p> I always think that I will wait until my traffic reaches certain level before building a list. And when you spelled out the steps I realize that it actually can be done pretty quickly in 20 minutes( I 've already had the free offer ready). <p> Other than that, I think one of the most important things I took from this post is to get out of the comfort zone and try different content formats( steps 14, 16, and 17). It 's challenging but I believe it will get results. <p> Informative article.I believe interviewing an expert is one of the best way to get a blog started and can even create an information product since they are already in the field in quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this post( twice) and I jotted down a few key points, actually nine actions. <p> I 'm 100% sure I 'm not going to be able to address all of them in just two days but I will also write these down on a white board next to my monitors as well so I make sure I can complete them as soon as possible. <p> Corbett, This post turned out to be of much use and ispiration for me. I did n't shut my laptop down for 3 days in order not to lose the ideas I had while going through these 21 points. I 've already implemented some stuff and have about 5 more points under development. Thanks! <p> This is an awesome list that gives bloggers an actionable list to get going on. I just started my blog and I 've spent hours and hours of reading about what to do for my blog and it becomes very hard to know when you have enough info to get started. These are easily digested tasks with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the task and makes it something you can really tackle. Thanks so much! <p> I am glad I found you from Pat Flynn 's blog through the HD interview he had with you. Thank you for the valid information you are sharing here. I am thinking to register your course when you start offering it next time. I am reading your posts for good stuffs during the mean time. <p> Wow Corbett that is is some epic $h*! That is some serious content there and I have n't even read the comments yet. I do have to admit though when you ask you 're visitors to do something they defiantly will do it. I 've only done a few of the things on this list but I 'm printing this article out to share with others and use as a check list to get things going. Thanks for all the great info. <p> Thanks for this post, by the way. I 've been meaning to build a facebook page for my blog for months -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, writing that just reminded me : you 're the guy who wrote the big " get off your ass and do it already! " post that triggered me to start writing my blog in the first place!( This one : http : **26;2668;TOOLONG) I do n't think I ever thanked you for that. That was a life-changer for me
