5058541 <h> Summer Soundtrack <p> These songs take me back! My brothers and I spent our summers listening to music. Swimming all day. Riding our Huffy Motocross bikes around the neighborhood with wads of Hubba Bubba in our cheeks. Kicking off our shoes to Don McLean and air guitar jamming to Kansas up on the fireplace hearth in our groovy living room. Cruising in our red Volkswagon with no seatbelts. Dancing to my older sister 's K-Tel records. If I remember anything about these lazy days, it 's that the records were always spinning, and we found so much joy and laughter
