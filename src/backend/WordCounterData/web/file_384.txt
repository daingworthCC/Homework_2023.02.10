5065241 <h> AMT : Biggest fiscal cliff tax headache <p> More than 60 million taxpayers might have to wait until March to file their returns or get a refund if Congress fails to patch the AMT by the end of the year. <p> NEW YORK( CNNMoney) -- If lawmakers fail to protect the middle class from having to pay the Alternative Minimum Tax by Dec. 31, next year 's tax filing season will be a mess for tens of millions of taxpayers. <p> That was the gist of a letter sent Tuesday from Acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller to top tax writers in Congress as lawmakers are poised to start negotiations about the fiscal cliff. <p> Just how much of a mess? <p> The IRS would need to tell more than 60 million taxpayers that they may not file their 2012 tax returns or receive a refund until the IRS makes changes to its systems.
