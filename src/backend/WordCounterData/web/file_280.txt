She has a well-trained understanding of animal behavior and her astonishing awareness of changes in attitude and mood gives her insight into their lives. She also has a special talent for translating that understanding into dialogue from their point of view. I follow her blog and newsgroup posts for updates on her animal family, and read everything she writes for those moments her non-human characters speak up.
