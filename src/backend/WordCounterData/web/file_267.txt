5053441 <p> Billie Joe Armstrong, the front man of rock group Green Day, has entered treatment for substance abuse, according to a statement on the band 's website. <p> The announcement came two days after the rocker had a meltdown onstage at the iHeart Radio Music Festival in Las Vegas. <p> Armstrong became angry after the band was flashed a one-minute warning sign to wrap up the set on Friday. The front man stopped singing and delivered a profanity-laced tirade that was captured on a video that quickly went viral. <p> When the one minute ran out, the " American Idiot " singer smashed his guitar on the stage. <p> " Let me show you what one one expletive minute expletive means! " he said before flipping the middle finger and walking off stage. <p> The band issued a statement apologizing for Armstrong 's outburst at the festival. <p> The band before Armstrong 's breakdown( Kevin Mazur/WireImage/Getty Images) <p> " We would like everyone to know that our set was not cut short by Clear Channel and to apologize to those we offended at the iHeartRadio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The band had to cancel some promotional appearances for their new album, " Uno, " which was due to be released Tuesday. <p> Earlier this month, the singer was admitted to the hospital in Italy, forcing the band to cancel a concert in Bologna. <p> His band mates, Tre Cool and Mike Dirnt, released a short video apologizing to their fans. <p> " We apologize profusely, you know, this is really unfortunate, but Billie got rushed to the hospital last night due to illness, and the doctors do n't think it 's a good idea for him to play today, " Dirnt says in the video. <p> " We 're beyond devastated and sad, " Cool adds, " Billie is extremely upset about it, and we 'll see you soon. " <p> Armstrong had reportedly been suffering from " gastric problems. " No further information has been released about his condition. <p> The rocker is set to debut on season 3 of NBC 's " The Voice " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another idiot hits the dust... sad, but then again... any talent has always been in question. He can always flip burgers, when he gets tired of flipping " birds. " <p> Posted by : Bensky September 23, 2012, 6:50 pm 6:50 pm <p> I have listened to Green Day since the early ' 90? s. I have enjoyed their music but have watched Billie Joe become more and more of an narcissistic little a-hole. HE is an American idiot. <p> Posted by : Mike September 23, 2012, 6:53 pm 6:53 pm <p> C.r.a.p. band anyway........ <p> Posted by : Svenghooli September 23, 2012, 7:07 pm 7:07 pm <p> He was mad because Bieber was being his normal shallow self and used up all the band 's time. Ca n't say I blame him for being irritated. <p> Posted by : Nancy September 23, 2012, 7:35 pm 7:35 pm <p> Good grief, since when did anyone really care what crap bands like this do? It 's pathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Posted by : J.

LOL.. yea, I would be pissed to. If what they said in the video is true, why does Usher suppose to get more time.. he sure as **** not any better. <p> Posted by : dbase1986 September 23, 2012, 8:41 pm 8:41 pm <p> " Gastric problems " starting in Italy, no less? Sounds like how thing started to end for Kurt Cobain. <p> Posted by : Ziff September 23, 2012, 8:44 pm 8:44 pm <p> I have read other reports that say ALL acts except Rhianna had 30 minutes and that was the amount of time Green Day had. That reports contradicts the video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were erroneous). Do n't know which is right but since this is ABC, I 'm sure they put 4 seconds into research, tops. I agree with Bensky, although I 'm sure Billie Joe was always an egotist. He now has enough exposure so more can see it.( I have been a fan of GD for quite while, but BJA needs a reality check.) <p> Posted by : Brent Smith September 23, 2012, 9:27 pm 9:27 pm <p> Nancy, being irritated is one thing, doing what he did was embarrassing IMO. Geeze leweeze, it took him five whacks to break his guitar. More frejoles Billie Joe, I 've seen oysters on the half-shell with more spank. <p> Posted by : Michael September 23, 2012, 9:43 pm 9:43 pm <p> ABC, you should provide the full picture.

For Billie it was the exact opposite. <p> Ca n't wait for Wierd Al Yankovic to parody this moron. Al, when are you going to interview this little narcissistic fart? <p> Posted by : Jagmanxke September 23, 2012, 11:09 pm 11:09 pm <p> A rock musician said " F...

But you still get to smash your guitar. <p> Posted by : RB K-Tel September 24, 2012, 4:20 am 4:20 am <p> Good for him. Honestly, cutting a band 's set in half in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else is not cool and I do n't know any rock star around who would stand for that. Seriously, you tell me how a rock star is supposed to handle that. End your second or third song the crowd is loving and just say good night? God bless him if he 's using and I hope he gets clean. Billy Joel 's tantrum over not being properly lit was pathetic. Kanye West is a joke. But Billie Joe Armstrong? People live to see someone smash a guitar, and I 'm sure every Green Day fan there was P.O.'ed at the concert promoters, not at the self-respecting rock star showing those promoters for the disorganized and disrespectful clowns that they are. <p> Posted by : Brand September 24, 2012, 6:02 am 6:02 am <p> That 's punk rock or just rock and roll for ya. Who care 's if he flipped out alot of other bands have done worse. I say way to go Billie for not putting up with that BS. Remember they started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you expect? <p> Posted by : Sluggz September 24, 2012, 7:46 am 7:46 am <p> Sorry folks, I think it 's funny as heck. Though, he eventually broke his guitar, he could n't outright. It just looked hilarious. <p> Posted by : LMAO September 24, 2012, 10:21 am 10:21 am <p> totoal BS... Green Day oldest punk band around, grammy winners sold over 50 million ablbums and some jackhole from iheartradio is telling them how long they can play is so stupid, and now this crap about him abusing drugs is ridiculous, he did not have a meltdown he made a totally rational statement basically saying, we 're rockstars and been around over 20 years and your telling us what to do and how long we play? FU... to me that is what being a rockstar is about saying standing up to the man in this case iheartradio who blackballed their performance and cut their playing time in half when acts like usher got more time, absolutely ridiculous <p> Posted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12:02 pm <p> Fake punk poser goes to rehab. So? All that means is he 'll soon foist his album of self-actualization upon the masses. <p> And lose the makeup guys... you look like trannies. <p> Posted by : Ed September 24, 2012, 12:37 pm 12:37 pm <p> i respect him for what he did. he stood up to the disgusting hollywood music scene. then after doing so he suddenly has a " substance abuse " problem? no. its just them lashing back. he was right for what he did. <p> Posted by : mattmeserole September 24, 2012, 12:39 pm 12:39 pm <p> First off, Billie Joe is not " old school ". They are new school and much more mainstream. There are older and much better punk bands out there that do n't have to play the iheartradio festival to make a quick buck. He 's just butthurt. I doubt they cut their set short and even in their video " apology " that it
