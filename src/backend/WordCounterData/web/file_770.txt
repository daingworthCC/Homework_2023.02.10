The hiding is another token of the childlike simplicity of the parents of our race under the shame and fear of guilt. The question, " Where art thou? " implies that the Lord was aware of their endeavor to hide themselves from him. <p> The voice of the Lord - The voice is properly used here, for as God is an infinite Spirit, and can not be confined to any form, so he can have no personal appearance. It is very likely that God used to converse with them in the garden, and that the usual time was the decline of the day,???????? leruach haiyom, in the evening breeze ; and probably this was the time that our first parents employed in the more solemn acts of their religious worship, at which God was ever present. The time for this solemn worship is again come, and God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinned, and therefore, instead of being found in the place of worship, are hidden among the trees! Reader, how often has this been thy case! <p> And they heard the voice of the Lord God,.... Which they had heard before, and knew, though perhaps now in another tone, and very terrible, which before was mild and gentle, pleasant and delightful : some by it understand a clap of thunder, sometimes called the voice of the Lord, Psalm 29:3 and the rather because mention is made afterwards of a wind ; but rather the voice of the Son of God, the eternal Word, is here meant, who appeared in an human form, as a pledge of his future incarnation, and that not only as a Judge, to arraign, examine, and condemn the parties concerned in this act of disobedience to God, but as a Saviour of men, to whom, as such, he made himself known, as the event shows, and therefore they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, as to flee from him ; and so the Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan paraphrase it, " the voice of the Word of the Lord God ", the essential Word of God then with him, and since made flesh, and dwelt among men as the Saviour of them ; and to him agrees what follows : <p> walking in the garden in the cool of the day ; or " at the wind of the day "( q) ; of " that day " in which man was created and fell, as some conclude from hence ; in the evening, at sun setting ; for very often when the sun sets a wind rises, at least a gentle breeze ; and this might bring the sound of the voice, and of the steps of this glorious Person, the sooner to the ears of Adam and his wife, which gave them notice of his near approach, and caused them to hasten their flight : some render it emphatically, " at the wind of that day " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind which arose at that time, as a sign and testimony of the indignation of God, as the sound of a violent wind was a testimony of the coming of the Spirit of God, Acts 2:2. <p> and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God, amongst the trees of the garden ; conscious of their guilt, and vainly imagining they could flee from his presence, which is everywhere, and hide themselves from his sight, before whom every creature is manifest, be it where it will ; and very foolishly fancying, that the thick trees and bushes in the garden would be a screen and shelter for them : and sad shifts do wretched mortals make to secure themselves from the wrath of God, who are ignorant of the justifying righteousness and atoning sacrifice of the Son of God : it is in the singular number in the original text, " in the midst of the tree of the garden "( s) ; which some understand of the fig tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shade of which they hid themselves ; and particularly of the Indian fig tree, which is so large, that it is said that fifty horsemen may shade themselves at noon day under it ; nay, some say four hundred( t) ; but tree may be put for trees, the singular for the plural. <p> 3:6-8 Here we see what Eve 's parley with the tempter ended in : Satan at length gains his point. God tried the obedience of our first parents by forbidding them the tree of knowledge, and Satan doth as it were join issue with God, and in that very thing undertakes to seduce them into a transgression ; and here we find how he prevailed, God permitting it for wise and holy ends. 1. We have here the inducements that moved them to transgress. The woman being deceived, was ring - leader in the transgression, 1Tim 2:14 She saw that the tree was - It was said of all the rest of the fruit trees wherewith the garden of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight, and good for food. She imagined a greater benefit by this tree than by any of the rest, that it was a tree not only not to be dreaded, but to be desired to make one wise, and therein excelling all the rest of the trees. This she saw, that is, she perceived and understood it by what the devil had said to her. She gave also to her husband with her - ' T is likely he was not with her when she was tempted ; surely if he had, he would have interposed to prevent the sin ; but he came to her when she had eaten, and was prevailed with by her to eat likewise. She gave it to him ; persuading him with the same arguements that the serpent had used with her ; adding this to the rest, that she herself had eaten of it, and found it so far from being deadly that it was extremely pleasant and grateful. And he did eat - This implied the unbelief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ; discontent with his present state, and an ambition of the honour which comes not from God. He would be both his own carver, and his own master, would have what he pleased, and do what he pleased ; his sin was in one word disobedience, Rom 5:19, disobedience to a plain, easy and express command, which he knew to be a command of trial. He sins against light and love, the clearest light and the dearest love that ever sinner sinned against. But the greatest aggravation of his sin was, that he involved all his posterity in sin and ruin by it. He could not but know that he stood as a public person, and that his disobedience would be fatal to all his seed ; and if so, it was certainly both the greatest treachery and the greatest cruelty that ever was. Shame and fear seized the criminals, these came into the world along with sin, and still attend it. The Eyes of them both were opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for what they had done Now, when it was too late, they saw the happiness they were fallen from, and the misery they were fallen into. They saw God provoked, his favour forfeited, his image lost ; they felt a disorder in their own spirits, which they had never before been conscious of ; they saw a law in their members warring against the law of their minds, and captivating them both to sin and wrath ; they saw that they were naked, that is, that they were stripped, deprived of all the honours and joys of their paradise state, and exposed to all the miseries that might justly be expected from an angry God ; laid open to the contempt and reproach of heaven and earth, and their own consciences. And they sewed or platted fig leaves together, and, to cover, at least, part of their shame one from another, made themselves aprons. See here what is commonly the folly of those that have sinned : they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obtain their pardon from God And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day - T is supposed he came in a human shape ; in no other similitude than that wherein they had seen him when he put them into paradise ; for he came to convince and humble them, not to amaze and terrify them. He came not immediately from heaven in their view as afterwards on mount Sinai, but he came in the garden, as one that was still willing to be familiar with them. He came walking, not riding upon the wings of the wind, but walking deliberately, as one slow to anger. He came in the cool of the day, not in the night, when all fears are doubly fearful ; nor did he come suddenly upon them, but they heard his voice at some distance, giving them notice of his coming ; and probably it was a still small voice, like that in which he came to enquire after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lord God - A sad change! Before they had sinned, if they heard the voice of the Lord God coming towards them, they would have run to meet him, but now God was become a terror to them, and then no marvel they were become a terror to themselves. <p> 8. they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden-The divine Being appeared in the same manner as formerly-uttering the well-known tones of kindness, walking in some visible form( not running hastily, as one impelled by the influence of angry feelings). How beautifully expressive are these words of the familiar and condescending manner in which He had hitherto held intercourse with the first pair. <p> in the cool of the day-literally, " the breeze of the day, " the evening. <p> hid themselves amongst the trees of the garden-Shame, remorse, fear-a sense of guilt-feelings to which they had hitherto been strangers disordered their minds and led them to shun Him whose approach they used to welcome. How foolish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> 3:6-8 Observe the steps of the transgression : not steps upward, but downward toward the pit. 1. She saw. A great deal of sin comes in at the eye. Let us not look on that which we are in danger of lusting after, Mt 5:28. 2. She took. It was her own act and deed. Satan may tempt, but he can not force ; may persuade us to cast ourselves down, but he can not cast us down, Mt 4:6. 3. She did eat. When she looked perhaps she did not intend to take ; or when she took, not to eat : but it ended in that. It is wisdom to stop the first motions of sin, and to leave it off before it be meddled with. 4. She gave it also to her husband with her. Those that have done ill, are willing to draw in others to do the same. 5. He did eat. In neglecting the tree of life, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tree of knowledge, which was forbidden, Adam plainly showed a contempt of what God had bestowed on him, and a desire for what God did not see fit to give him. He would have what he pleased, and do what he pleased. His sin was, in one word, disobedience, Ro 5:19 ; disobedience to a plain, easy, and express command. He had no corrupt nature within, to betray him ; but had a freedom of will, in full strength, not weakened or impaired. He turned aside quickly. He drew all his posterity into sin and ruin. Who then can say that Adam 's sin had but little harm in it? When too late, Adam and Eve saw the folly of eating forbidden fruit. They saw the happiness they fell from, and the misery they were fallen into. They saw a loving God provoked, his grace and favour forfeited. See her what dishonour and trouble sin is ; it makes mischief wherever it gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will bring shame ; either the shame of true repentance, which ends in glory, or that shame and everlasting contempt, to which the wicked shall rise at the great day. See here what is commonly the folly of those that have sinned. They have more care to save their credit before men, than to obtain their pardon from God. The excuses men make to cover and lessen their sins, are vain and frivolous ; like the aprons of fig-leaves, they make the matter never the better : yet we are all apt to cover our transgressions as Adam. Before they sinned, they would have welcomed God 's gracious visits with humble joy ; but now he was become a terror to them. No marvel that they became a terror to themselves, and full of confusion. This shows the falsehood of the tempter, and the frauds of his temptations. Satan promised they should be safe, but they can not so much as think themselves so! Adam and Eve were now miserable comforters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earth, the princes, the generals, the rich, the mighty, and every slave and every free man hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains. Genesis 18:33 When the LORD had finished speaking with Abraham, he left, and Abraham returned home. Leviticus 26:12 I will walk among you and be your God, and you will be my people. Deuteronomy 23:14 For the LORD your God moves about in your camp to protect you and to deliver your enemies to you. Your camp must be holy, so that he will not see among you anything indecent and turn away from you. Job 31:33 if I have concealed my sin as men do, by hiding my guilt in my heart Psalm 139:1 For the director of music. Of David. A psalm. O LORD, you have searched me and you know me. Hosea 10:8 The high places of wickedness will be destroyed--it is the sin of Israel. Thorns and thistles will grow up and cover their altars. Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!
