5040041 <h> What Do You Have to Say about " Trophy Inflation " and " Gamification "? <p> An interesting e-mail from a reader/listener named Andrei Herasimchuk about what he calls " gamification " : <p> It 's a word and term that drives me nuts these days. I design software, and have done so for two decades now. Everyone is trying to add gamification features to their products these days in the tech industry. Think badges, achievements, and things normally found in a game like World of Warcraft. People in this industry lately seem to believe that these sorts of things drive engagement in their products. From everything I 've seen, and from influences of your work, I 'd assume what people really want to do is find ways to design incentives into products. Incentives versus Gamification? What works better? <p> Andrei( and I) would love to hear what you have to say on this question. I have a few superficial thoughts : <p> For some years now, it has struck me that we 're in an age of severe trophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trophy or medal ; <p> That said, I( and my kids) like trophies as much as the next people, so when you 're on the receiving end of a relatively meaningless award, it still feels better than zero ; additionally : <p> Winning even a virtual medal, as silly as it seems, is still fun, at least for me, as experienced for instance on the very, very excellent World Golf Tour game ; that said, I do n't know if I want such trinkets cluttering up a piece of financial or productivity software ; and lastly : <p> Who 's to say, per Andrei 's point, that " gamification " is n't a perfectly legitimate form of incentive? <h> COMMENTS : 58 <p> The " everyone gets a trophy for just showing up " is why there are so many entitled idiots running around these days. <p> From half of the Occupy Wall Street crowd to 90% of high school and college kids today, they all think they deserve to be given things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dunham and have mommy 's connections to help us suddenly get our scripts produced despite having no experience or discernible talent. <p> Sorry kids, if you are n't born into it, those trophies you got just for playing are setting you up for a bitter disappointment later in life, when you realize only winners -- and the well connected -- get the trophy. <p> Not everyone gets a trophy for showing up. Some people get a trophy for doing well, others get a trophy for showing up, but the people who get the big trophies do not get the showing up trophy. <p> And that 's partly where the message is lost. The trophy should be used to reward the effort, sportsmanship, growth, experience, etc. You know, the reasons why you enrolled you brat in the sport in the first place. Instead, parents hand them out as if they 're pacifiers, and of course no good lesson is learned from this. <p> As for people who believe they should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from any of my peers. They 're all eager to work, often times working for no reward just to have a chance at scraps further down the line. The people who really believe they should get something for nothing are the people whining about OWS and kids these days. They made a mess and then expect the kids to clean it up without offering the kids anything in return. <p> Sports programs aimed at very young children have n't kept score for decades, so this is n't a new idea for this generation. <p> There are two reasons for this. The first is that preschool and Kindergarten kids barely know how to count anyway, so the actual score is meaningless to them.( T-ball does n't keep score. Little League baseball, which starts at age 7, does keep score, except for programs designed for children with disabilities.) We 're talking about kids who ca n't necessarily count a group of items and come up with the same number five times in a row. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour-long game? <p> The other is that you want them to focus on individual outcomes( did you catch the ball? did you kick the ball? did you throw the ball?) rather than overall, aggregated outcome by two whole teams, which is really beyond their cognitive ability. If the individual child did what he was supposed to, you do n't want that achievement swamped by " losing " because his best effort, in combination with poor performance by randomly selected teammates, was n't as good as the other team 's performance. <p> I agree with Honest Rob, there are a ton of entitled idiots running around. There 's an entire generation of people that want their social programs paid for and then cut before the next generation can take advantage of them! These are the same people that continuously voted for politicians that increased government spending and decreased taxes during a boom economy, figuring that by the time the bill came due they 'd be dead. <p> Rob -- The fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids today " shows how little you know about either subject. It serves a political end to belittle the protesters without addressing the substance of their protest -- that those at the top are exploiting their power and money to enrich themselves at the expense of the rest of society. That they did n't necessarily get where hey are solely by hard work, and now that they are there the rules are rigged in their favor. To attack them simply because they do n't wear suits and fit the corporate mold does not minimize the truth of their protest. I 'm a " late boomer " -- born in the early 60s and share little with their mainstream culture. I know lots of of school and college and kids and they do not expect things to given to them any more than the kids I knew in college. As a young person today you do n't have to be away from home very long to see how hard it will be to make it in the world. Good jobs that pay well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduates. In part because their parents can no longer afford to stop working, in part because so many good jobs that their parents and grandparents had have gone away. A sense of entitlement evaporates pretty quickly when you have to work a bad job and still ca n't make rent. <p> As a member of a generation who received all those participation trophies I cordially ask you to shut it. <p> We did n't ask for participation trophies. They were handed to us. We did n't demand to be told we were special. Our parents and teachers just did it. <p> Now people of the same generation that gave us trophies for showing up and told us we are special are mad because they think we 're entitled. We 're the ones who should be mad that they spent the first twenty years of our lives lying to us about how the world works leaving us unprepared for getting out on our own. Considering that, I 'd say we 're doing pretty well. <p> And OWS is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's about a system that rewards people who use their power to increase their own wealth and power at the expense of the rest of society. It 's about the wealthy using their money to convince politicians that if they give them more tax breaks and loopholes, they 'll use that money to create jobs, when they just really just use it to buy another house or hide it in a foreign account. It 's about how CEOs pay less in taxes than their secretaries. It 's about the idea that equality under the law should be more than a good idea. <p> Well, Elwin, in the first place, nobody 's mad at you. It just appears to all of us that things have gone dreadfully wrong, and we 're trying to figure out why, just as you are. Second, the generation that gave you trophies was counseled by the ' experts ' of a previous generation who told us that everything would be great if we just followed their instructions. They had many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't really understand, so we believed them. Your generation is a lot hipper to the notion that nobody really knows what they 're talking about &; everything has to be taken with loads of salt. We elders have had to learn that the hard way. Third, your final paragraph is right on. It 's not a generational thing at all. We 're all getting hustled, and trying to work out what to do about it. If I had space and time, I 'd go over some of the other ways we were lied to when we were young. Why, in my day there were even respectable people running around telling us that atomic radiation from bomb tests might be good for us.( We did n't actually fall for that one, thank goodness.) <p> I think gamification works really well when it is associated with education. It allows the students to see things such as science and mathematics in a more literal sense and it provides friendly competition. Children need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect job. You need to earn your way and beat( win) against people when interviewing. So with providing badges and trophies to students who ' win ' it 's a win for everyone involved because then they are being educated in the process. <p> Achievements in an isolated system probably wo n't do much, but XBox Live, Playstation Network, or Steam ones might very well actually motivate some people. There are whole communities devoted to earning this virtual trinkets, after all. Those communities may not overlap that much with, say, accounting software, though. Furthermore, there are many who prefer to isolate their social and work spheres. <p> Visual Studio( the software development environment) has achievements via a Microsoft-developed extension( http : **35;5505;TOOLONG...), but I 'm pretty sure they 're jokes, especially since they have achievements for bad coding practices and are very much not integrated with the Live system. <p> Steam obviously has an achievement system, and they 've recently announced they 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. It 's quite possible that 'll result in some achievement-bearing productivity applications. <p> Personally, I think fitness and education are better targets for gamification. Use of productivity software is generally motivated by a conventional salary and benefits package, and that 's a heavyweight competitor ; there 's not much low-hanging fruit there. There may be some utility to be mined down the road, but, like paying for grades, it 's not a properly developed area yet. <p> I do think Andrei overstates the popularity of such initiatives. Also, it 's obviously a false contrast between incentives and gamification. <p> Gameification is just one part of Game Theory and as Game Theory is better understood by non-economists it does n't surprise me that we see more gameification. It is n't just tied to the software world, but it is no surprise to see it there first as many programers are also gamers. You see it being used more in schools than ever before as well. <p> I am an avid gamer. Have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( I do n't like the word and tend not to use it but for the sake of convenience) is something I 've been pushing in our agency( with not much effect I 'm afraid) for some time. <p> It 's not really about the trophies per se, I find, but more about the completion of a specific challenge. There is something fundamental in human psychology that drives us to achieve these specific tasks, especially when we receive credit for them. XBox Live stumbled onto this early and I challenge you to buy a mainstream XBox game that now does n't include a wide array of achievements( or ' cheevos ' as the community has dubbed them). <p> Gamification in advertising is the continuation of an inherent and increasingly sophisticated psychological trend that started with " making things look good " and has continued to develop through ' which colours make people feel hungry ' and research into other similar psychological phenomena. Gamification is in its early days, which is why most people managing advertising firms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be gamers) do n't quite understand it yet, and have n't properly implemented it, but it is as inevitable as any other psychological insight that has been proven in the field. <p> Gamification is a legitimate form of incentives. All it requires is for the person earning the virtual trophy to feel incentivized by it. <p> More than that, however, this sort of gamification can improve the quality of some projects for those on the outside. For instance in a user-generated content system like Amazon 's reviews or a Q &A; site like Yahoo! Answers or StackOverflow.com( cf. http : **35;5579;TOOLONG...), points/badges/trophies of respondents gives me a heuristic to quickly filter the responses by quality. A person with a higher rep and more badges is more likely to be right. <p> Obviously this can go awry. E.g., the user might leave entirely positive Amazon reviews since those tend to get more " helpful " votes, enhancing one 's rep, and " not helpful " votes, bringing down one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to people who down-vote when they simply disagree with the content of a legitimate( non-soapbox) review.( That rarely happens when one disagrees with an ebullient positive review.) <p> Or the system can be explicitly " gamed, " e.g., using sock puppets to pad one 's numbers -- as all the top dogs on Yahoo! Answers have to do. <p> But on the whole badges are still useful to outsiders. <p> Speaking personally, I remember I longed for people to recognize my work on Wikipedia by awarding me a barn star on my talk page. I tried to give out barn stars to encourage others, and perhaps even inspire them to give me one in return( that did n't work very well). <p> Actually, I use a website( actually a group of them listed under stackexchange.com) that completely rely on menaingless incentives. <p> The one I use the most is StackOverflow.com. It 's a software development QA site. You earn reputation points based on the quality of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points if you do n't word questions well, or do n't research the question well enough before posting. It 's completely community moderated and the points are awarded by members on the site. It 's a facinating model as you 'll find that people will spend much more time crafting a question and/or response in order to avoid losing points on your reputation.( Loss Aversion anyone?) <p> New York City 's subways and buses carry roughly seven million passengers a day, which goes a long way toward explaining...
