5056441 <p> They may not have won it all, but a ninth-place finish out of 114 teams from 30 states is n't half bad. <p> The Northwest Blaze 's experience in the ASA 14U National Softball Championships last week confirmed the team 's status as one of the best in the nation. <p> " It 's not bad at all, " Blaze head coach Chris Kelly said. " I 'm really proud of them. They worked hard all winter. " <p> Kelly said the players were able to shake off a disappointing third-place finish in the Oregon ASA State Tournament July 13-15 to turn in a solid showing at nationals. <p> " It shows their character, " Kelly said. " I think they were really disappointed in their performance that day. They reevaluate their goals after every tournament, and they really responded. " <p> The Blaze, a summer all-star team made up of 12 players from eight Portland-area high schools, including Glencoe, Liberty, Banks and Westview, finished the eight-day tournament in Sioux Falls, S.D. with a 5-3 record and the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three loses were to the teams that finished second, third and seventh in the tournament. <p> To quantify the depth of competition in the tournament, Kelly said the team from Houston, Texas, called Sudden Impact, draws from the 200-plus high schools in the megacity. <p> " Some of the bigger states, it was a little bit intimidating, " Banks freshman-to-be MaKenna Partain said. " They have a lot of players to choose from. You knew they were going to be good when they were from Texas. " <p> The tournament started with pool play, with the Blaze drawing their opening game July 30 against Impact Gold of Texas. Despite Mariah Mulcahy, sophomore-to-be at St. Helens, allowing just two hits and striking out eight, Impact Gold, which ultimately finished third overall, won 3-0. <p> The Blaze won their next pool play game, 7-2, against Wellington Wild of Florida on July 31 to advance to the winner 's bracket. In that game, Partain hit a grand slam to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Macy Besuyen was also 3 for 4 with a run batted in as the Blaze banged out nine hits in the game. <p> In a first-round game in the winner 's bracket on Aug. 1, the Blaze pounded out 16 hits in an 18-0 rout of Brandon Rage of South Dakota. Banks sophomore Madison Soper had four RBIs, while Mulcahy and Westview freshman Abby Greer combined in the circle for the shutout. <p> In the second round later in the day Aug. 1, the Blaze beat Sizzle Blue, the Nebraska state champion, 7-3. Soper and Liberty sophomore Kelly Meeuwsen each went 2 for 3, while Partain led off the scoring with a bases loaded triple in the first inning. <p> The Blaze continued to advance in the winner 's bracket with a 7-2 victory Aug. 3 over the Katy Cruisers of Texas.

" We knew as we went on it would get tougher and tougher. I was pretty happy. I think we could have done a lot better, but it was a really good start for our first nationals. " <p> The victory over Texas Fusion matched the Blaze against Team Arizona in the next round on Aug. 4, which ended in a 12-1 defeat to drop the Blaze into the loser 's bracket. Team Arizona finished as the tournament 's runner up. <p> The Blaze 's tournament run ended later that day in a 7-1 loss to Texas Sudden Impact. <p> But it was n't all business for the Blaze. <p> Players were able to do some sightseeing, which included a trip the Great Plains Zoo, go shopping and meet players from other teams. <p> " It was pretty cool, " Partain said. @ @ @ @ @ @ @
