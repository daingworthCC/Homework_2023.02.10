5259141 <h> Springbase Case Study : Skinit.com <p> Leading e-commerce retailer increases revenue by over $10,000 per month with Springbase business application platform <h> Testing to Optimize Visitor Conversions <p> Skinit is the global leader in mobile device personalization, offering customers the largest portfolio of skin designs and electronic devices, with each skin custom cut to fit perfectly on each device. Skinit 's online ordering and customization tools allow consumers to create branded, designed, and personalized electronic device covers, or skins, using high quality 3M products. <p> When Skinit rolled out their Dynamically Generated Landing Pages earlier this year, they needed a custom app built to quickly scale the development of over 1,000 custom designed landing pages. Within days of the app being completed, they were able to immediately start batching out custom pages and push out paid search ad links as well as affiliate links. The end result was not only huge gains in efficiency and scalability, but also nearly $10,000 in additional revenue generated through increased conversion rates. <p> Before they were able to roll out this new initiative, however, Jason Reeder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application platform that would offer both quick implementation and scalability at a reasonable cost. <p> " For years we had been using Excel spreadsheets and custom-built macros to handle the data manipulation process. Upon seeing the first demo, I immediately knew that Springbase would be a huge step forward in efficiency. I learned a few weeks later that we could also integrate with vital third-party business tools like the Google AdWords API, which was icing on the cake, " recalls Reeder. " I 'd been trying to break free of Excel and Access, but few cost-effective solutions were available. We needed a highly customizable solution with a real interface -- one that allowed us to manipulate simple query code on the fly and would be able to generate over 300,000 lines of custom product fields within seconds. " <p> Skinit needed an efficient and stable business application platform on which they could quickly and continually add new custom apps to help support their many SEM campaigns and e-commerce initiatives. <h> Finding a Platform <p> Skinit looked at several options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or were prohibitively expensive. <p> " The process of getting the app developed on Springbase was amazing. The team had a refreshing take on platform applications and customer service. Their sales and engineering teams took the time to listen to our specific needs, and were completely hands-on, helping us at every step to build our initial application. Springbase exceeded my expectations and continues to provide some of the finest service I 've encountered with any vendor. The cost savings and gains in efficiency we realized by using Springbase has been unbelievable, " said Reeder. <h> Springbase as a Platform <p> Springbase had Skinit 's dynamic landing page creation application up and running in just two weeks. Skinit has since commissioned Springbase to develop 4 additional applications, all hosted within the same account. <p> " It was amazing how quickly Springbase helped get us on our feet. Their teams were willing to put in the effort to walk us through the entire process, giving us just the amount of support we needed. " <p> Working with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own custom application without having to vie for the limited time and resources of their internal IT department. <p> " Our engineering and IT teams did n't have the bandwidth for this project, so I had to find a workaround solution. In the end, we saved over 100 man-hours using Springbase to develop this solution. We could have easily spent over $5,000 just to get it off the ground, not to mention the cost of ongoing support. With Springbase, we were able to get launched quickly at a fraction of the cost. " <h> Results <p> Springbase 's development platform has enabled Skinit to quickly launch apps to support revenue generating marketing activities and has helped to create high levels of process efficiency. <p> " The application we built on Springbase is saving us 10 -- 12 hours per week. To edit 30 URLs, it would have taken 4 -- 5 hours. Now that we 're fully integrated, it takes just 15 -- 20 minutes. It allows us to focus on our core strengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources or hardware maintenance, " said Reeder. <p> With a tighter feedback loop, Skinit has also been able to sync their dynamic landing pages with keyword and product-specific targeting to provide increased user engagement for their web visitors. <p> " The dynamic landing pages we 're now able to create using the Springbase app have already helped increase conversion rates, reduce bounce rates and improve our Google quality scores for paid search campaigns -- all of which translates into approximately $10,000 in increased revenue for Q3. This combined with overall cost savings and increased efficiency should put the value of the app at over $50,000 through the end of the year. Right now, Springbase is the best value in the marketplace. Springbase is an efficiency tool and it gives us a competitive advantage. We 're 100% with Springbase.
