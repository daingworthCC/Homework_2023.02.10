5052941 <h> By the Way, Karlie Kloss and Joan Smalls Will Front MTV 's New House of Style <p> Walking the red carpet at last night 's MTV Video Music Awards in Los Angeles, Karlie Kloss and Joan Smalls confirmed their new gig as co-hosts of MTV 's House of Style reboot. The new show will offer insight into the contemporary modeling industry( during its initial run covering the supermodel-heavy nineties scene, hosts included Cindy Crawford, Shalom Harlow, and Molly Sims), as well as features on music and art ; Karlie 's excited to work with, of all people, Justin Bieber. Of course, Karlie also confirmed the news to us last night in New York during a Fashion 's Night Out party. That 's two events on two different coasts, at the same time. Our minds : blown! Now sure, Karlie almost certainly pretaped her little VMA promo against the carpet backdrop, but is n't it more exciting to consider she owns her very own Time-Turner? It 'd probably be a Chanel-branded Time-Turner at that
