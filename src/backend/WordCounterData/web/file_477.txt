5074541 <p> Rick Santorum is a dangerous man, but not many people actually believed he could do so well in Iowa. Santorum nearly captured a victory in the Iowa caucus on Tuesday, finishing second by only eight votes to Mitt Romney. Now that Rick Santorum is a serious threat to be the possible Republican nominee that faces President Obama, it 's time to parade the many things that he has said over the years. Here are 31 quotes that prove how ignorant, fanatical, heartless, and dangerous Rick Santorum is. <p> 1. " If the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual gay sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you have the right to adultery. You have the right to anything. Does that undermine the fabric of our society? I would argue yes, it does. It all comes from, I would argue, this right to privacy that does n't exist in my opinion in the United States Constitution. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever to my knowledge included homosexuality. That 's not to pick on homosexuality. It 's not, you know, man on child, man on dog, or whatever the case may be. It is one thing. " Rick Santorum, comparing homosexuality to bestiality, and saying that we do n't have the right to have consensual sex. He 's also saying we do n't have the right to privacy. <p> 2. " There are people who were gay and lived the gay lifestyle and are n't anymore. I do n't know if that 's the similar situation or that 's the case for anyone that 's black. It 's a behavioral issue as opposed to a color of the skin issue, and that 's the diff for serving in the military. " Rick Santorum, comparing homosexuality to being black. <p> 3. " The left, unfortunately, participates in bullying more than the right does. They say they 're tolerant, and they 're anything but tolerant of people who disagree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accusing the left of being bullies despite the fact that he agrees with those who want to execute gays and women who have abortions. <p> 4. " There are no Palestinians. All the people who live in the West Bank are Israelis. There are no Palestinians. This is Israeli land. " Rick Santorum, falsely claiming that there are no Palestinians living on the West Bank. <p> 5. " We executed a policy that I think was detrimental to everyone, including them, in my opinion, because sex and sexual preference should not be an issue in the military, period. " Rick Santorum, criticizing the repeal of DADT. <p> 6. " I believe the earth gets warmer and I also believe the earth gets cooler. And I think history points out that it does that and that the idea that man, through the production of CO2 -- which is a trace gas in the atmosphere, and the man-made part of that trace gas is itself a trace gas -- is somehow responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurd when you consider all the other factors. " Rick Santorum, claiming that man-made CO2 is not responsible for climate change despite the fact that CO2 levels have doubled since the start of the Industrial Revolution. <p> 7. " One of the things I will talk about, that no president has talked about before, is I think the dangers of contraception in this country. It 's not okay. a license to do things in a sexual realm that is counter to how things are supposed to be. Sex is supposed to be within marriage. It 's supposed to be for purposes that are yes, conjugal... but also procreative. That 's the perfect way that a sexual union should happen... This is special and it needs to be seen as special. " Rick Santorum, opposing contraception and frighteningly suggesting that he would make pre-marital sex illegal. <p> 8. " Certainly from the???? standpoint of a Republican, it 's a winner. Republicans will come out ahead in Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have two big cities with huge concentrations of voters -- and then overwhelm the rest of the state. All of a sudden, a Republican can win -- and would probably routinely win -- all but three or four congressional districts in Pennsylvania. It would turn it from a state Democrats rely on, as part of the base, to a state that they 're gon na lose under almost any scenario. " Rick Santorum, supporting the Pennsylvania GOP plan to change the way electoral votes are awarded to rig the election for Republicans. <p> 9. " You can say I 'm a hater. But I would argue I 'm a lover. I 'm a lover of traditional families and of the right of children to have a mother and father. I would argue that the future of America hangs in the balance, because the future of the family hangs in the balance. Is n't that the ultimate homeland security, standing up and defending marriage? " Rick Santorum, comparing his fight against homosexuality to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a right to do that, I have never questioned that the state has a right to do that. It is not a constitutional right, the state has the right to pass whatever statutes they have. That is the thing I have said about the activism of the Supreme Court, they are creating right, and they should be left up to the people to decide. " Rick Santorum, declaring that states have the right to outlaw all forms of birth control. <p> 11. " I do n't want to make black people 's lives better by giving them other people 's money. I want to give them the opportunity to go out and earn their money and provide for themselves and their families. The best way to do that is to get the manufacturing sector of the economy rolling. " Rick Santorum, saying that he has no interest in helping the African-American community. <p> 12. " This is an issue just like 9-11. We did n't decide we wanted to fight the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us. And if not now, when? When the supreme courts in all the other states have succumbed to the Massachusetts version of the law? " Rick Santorum, comparing legalizing same-sex marriage to the September 11th terrorist attacks. <p> 13. " Let 's look at what 's going to be taught in our schools because now we have same sex couples being the same and their sexual activity being seen as equal and being affirmed by society as heterosexual couples and their activity. So what is going to be taught to our people in health class in our schools? What is going to be taught to our children about who in our stories, even to little children -- what are married couples? What families look like in America? So, you are going to have in our curriculum spread throughout our curriculum worldview that is fundamentally different than what is taught in schools today? Is that not a consequence of gay marriage? " Rick Santorum, warning that homosexuality will indoctrinate our children in schools. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do n't heed those warnings and then put people at risk as a result of not heeding those warnings. There may be a need to look at tougher penalties on those who decide to ride it out and understand that there are consequences to not leaving. " Rick Santorum, suggesting we punish people who do n't evacuate their homes during a natural disaster shortly after Hurricane Katrina despite the fact that the evacuation of the coast was not properly executed. <p> 15. " The idea is that the state does n't have rights to limit individuals ' wants and passions. I disagree with that. I think we absolutely have rights because there are consequences to letting people live out whatever wants or passions they desire. " Rick Santorum, declaring that government has the right to limit people from pursuing their dreams. <p> 16. " Watching President Obama apologize last week for America 's arrogance -- before a French audience that owes its freedom to the sacrifices of Americans -- helped convince me that he has a deep-seated antipathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticizing President Obama for repairing US relations with France. And being ignorant of the fact that without the French, America would n't be a free nation today. <p> 17. " What we should be teaching are the problems and holes and I think there are legitimate problems and holes in the theory of evolution. And what we need to do is to present those fairly from a scientific point of view. And we should lay out areas in which the evidence supports evolution and the areas in the evidence that does not. " Rick Santorum, claiming that evolution theory is n't accurate. <p> 18. " Suffering, if you 're a Christian, suffering is a part of life. And it 's not a bad thing, it is an essential thing in life... There are all different ways to suffer. One way to suffer is through lack of food and shelter and there 's another way to suffer which is lack of dignity and hope and there 's all sorts of ways that people suffer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we have to consider both. " Rick Santorum, saying that Americans should suffer because suffering is good. <p> 19. " I believe that any doctor that performs an abortion, I would advocate that any doctor that performs an abortion, should be criminally charged for doing so. " Rick Santorum, advocating for arresting doctors that provide crucial medical services to women. <p> 20. " I support the Ryan budget plan. I think it 's the right direction on the major points. I ca n't say I 've read all of it, but on the major thrust of what he 's doing, I support what he wants to do with Medicare, Medicaid. The only thing I would do, frankly, as I 've said publicly many times, I think we should implement a lot of these things sooner than what he 's suggesting. " Rick Santorum, supporting the Paul Ryan plan to kill Medicare and Medicaid, and stating that he would end both programs right now. <p> 21. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare -- I mean, excuse me, poverty among African Americans and among single unmarried women, poverty was at the lowest rate ever in the history of this country. So Obama 's policies are not working, Bush polices worked! For long a time as a matter of fact. " Rick Santorum, falsely claiming that poverty was the lowest in history because of the Bush policies. In fact, poverty only increased. <p> 22. " 9/11 families and everybody else in America should be furious at this president that he 's walking abound taking credit for, you know, getting Osama bin Laden. He did n't get Osama bin Laden!... The president of the United States simply said -- courageous act, give him credit for saying yes -- but that 's all he did, is say yes. He did n't do the hard work. The people he 's going after did the hard work. And that is an outrage. " Rick Santorum, claiming that President Obama deserves no credit for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be angry because he order him killed. I 'm assuming that Santorum credits Bush which is laughable. <p> President Obama made killing bin Laden the priority and got the job done. <p> 23. " We 've seen with this president, experience matters. When that phone call comes at three o'clock in the morning, I will be up and ready for the call because I will know what 's going on in the world around us. " Rick Santorum, claiming that he has the experience necessary to be President and that Obama does n't. Need we remind him that Obama ordered bin Laden killed, helped Libya gain freedom, urged Mubarak to step down in Egypt, and gave the order for Navy snipers to fire on Somali pirates, thus freeing a captive American. Not to mention the emergencies President Obama has brilliantly handled at home, such as Hurricane Irene, the east coast earthquake, and the economy. <p> 24. " The American Left hates Christendom. They hate Western civilization. " Rick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Republicans have been tearing it apart for decades. <p> 25. " The idea that the Crusades and the fight of Christendom against Islam is somehow an aggression on our part is absolutely anti-historical. " Rick Santorum, claiming Christians played no role in starting the Crusades. 26. " The most dangerous place for an African-American in this country is in the womb. " Rick Santorum, claiming that blacks are more threatened by abortion than they are by GOP economic policies that discriminate against them. <p> 27. " The Social Security system, in my opinion, is a flawed design, period. But having said that, the design would work a lot better if we had stable demographic trends. We do n't have enough workers to support the retirees... A third of the young people in America are not in America today because of abortion. " Rick Santorum, blaming abortion for future Social Security shortfalls when in fact, it 's Republican anti-job policies that are to blame. <p> 28. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I want to beat China. I want to go to war with China and make America the most attractive place in the world to do business. " Rick Santorum, stating that he wants a war with China. <p> 29. " I think we should send a very clear message that if you are scientist from Russia or North Korea or from Iran, and you are going to work on a nuclear program to develop a nuclear bomb for Iran, you are not safe. " Rick Santorum, stating his intentions to kill Russian, North Korean, and Iranian citizens which would be an act of war. <p> 30. " I would be saying to the Iranians, you either open those facilities, begin to dismantle them and make them available to inspectors or we will degrade those facilities though air strikes. And make it very public that we are doing that. Iran would not get a nuclear weapon under my watch. " Rick Santorum, threatening war with Iran. <p> 31. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and charge those beaches on Normandy, to drop out of airplanes who knows where, and take on the battle for freedom. Average Americans, the very Americans that our government now, and this president, does not trust to make a decision on your health care plan. Those Americans risked everything so they could make that decision on their health care plan. " Rick Santorum, falsely claiming that WW2 veterans fought for the privatization of health care on D-Day, apparently oblivious to the fact that military health care is government run and a majority of WW2 veterans are currently using and enjoying Medicare. <p> From these quotes, we can tell that Rick Santorum is a Christian Right Wing zealot who is obsessed with violating our personal lives and privacy. He would restrict women, outlaw homosexuality, ban birth control, tell unmarried couples what they can and can not do, would throw senior citizens into poverty, thinks Americans should suffer, and he would enter America into even more wars. He is a Bible obsessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bush policies are worth continuing, and to top it all off, he 's a hypocrite. Rick Santorum is a frothy mixture of hate, bigotry, stupidity, insanity, and danger that America does n't ever need. <p> Yes, some of these statements were taken out of context, but when one examines the full context they sound worse. How can anyone seriously defend this jackass? Are there really people in this country who believe that birth control is a bad idea and should be outlawed? Whether you have some misguided religious motive for not using birth control, how can any interpretation of the constitution support laws to make it illegal? This homophobic, misogynist, moron has views that are so dangerous that the fact that there are enough republicans who would vote for him to help him win any primary indicates just how extreme and out of touch the republican party has become. <p> If Rick Santorum even BECOME a selected candidate for this election, not only the United States, but the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sudden these elections become unprofessional and trash-campaigning? I thought electing for president was suppose to be referenced on BENEFITING the U.S. and the world, not throwing your( Santorum 's) opinion on television. That 's not doing anything but making him look even dumber and futile than what he 's trying to make African-Americans and homosexuals " seem ". <p> This just in : Rick Santorum 's sweater vest closet just announced that he is a self-loathing homosexual ; and he 's about 10 minutes away from pulling a Mark Foley. <p> On a serious note : IF ELECTED, THIS GUY WILL END AMERICA AS WE KNOW IT! The freedoms that our forefathers and soldiers fought for and sacrificed for will be eroded in large swaths. Electing him will lead us down the path of becoming a theocracy. If you love your country, he is NOT the answer! <p> Has anyone asked Santorum why he calls the Pope a liar on climate change? Evidently this supposed loyal Catholic is willing to dissent from the papal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Pope has called for urgent international action on climate change. Santorum says it does n't exist! Evidently it 's the Tea Party that really calls the shots. <p> Can this article be reposted WITHOUT the biased commentary and with some references to where/when the quotes were made? I 'd like to think I 'm smart enough to interpret his quotes accurately, which I 'd like to add I do n't think the author has done adequately. Yes, he 's biased. So is " Second Amendment Democrat " here. For that matter, I am biased. I just do n't like someone else 's bias to be shoved in my face. Then again, I am on the internet... <p> Stephen D. Foster Jr. blew his hatchet piece with his obtuse comments. For example : " Rick Santorum, claiming that he has the experience necessary to be President and that Obama does n't. Need we remind him that Obama ordered bin Laden killed, helped Libya gain freedom, urged Mubarak to step down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fire on Somali pirates, thus freeing a captive American. Not to mention the emergencies President Obama has brilliantly handled at home, such as Hurricane Irene, the east coast earthquake, and the economy. " Did everyone forget how Hillary and her people finessed the Bin Laden operation while he was playing golf. She and Susan Rice finessed him into starting the Libya incursion. Obama did leave open the use of force on the pirates but was very tentative. He told Mubarak to step down, but not before weeks had evolved and many deaths had occurred. But the most OBTUSE assertion is " the emergencies President Obama has BRILLIANTLY handled at home " -- I do n't think Obama was BRILLIANT with Irene or the earthquake and especially the Joplin Tornado. He has n't done one single positive thing for the economy except talk. <p> By now we should all know by now that, when referring to any president, the administration as a whole is being credited when using the president 's name. While I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find ways to make these comments fit his agenda, I 'm puzzled by your use of the word ' Obtuse '. He was certainly clear about how he wanted us to view his selections. You perhaps meant his objective relativism?! <p> The Supreme Court of Canada say 's no to polygamy and incest because they are harmful to children and yes to gay marriage. As much as people who think like Santorum would like to believe differently, gay people get married in Canada and society there has n't disintegrated yet. Since he said, " In every society, the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality. " I guess he is unaware of Canada where, by the way, he could never get taken seriously never mind elected. <p> The fact that a person like this has as much support as he does says a lot about the state of the right wing base. I do n't know who 's worse, Santorum, or the people who ridiculously call themselves " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party a revolt against a corporation that had too much control over the government? See even the name of their movement is false. How appropriate. <p> Obama does n't have to beat Santorum. Santorum and his supporters beat him to it. <p> I agree with most of what he has said but before we can beleive any of it we need to remember that some crack head only put parts of the conversation as a statement so it sounds like he is worse than what he is. If only we could see the whole statement not just part. Either way I still think he has sound and correct views <p> Are you kidding me? Sound views? He literally makes a case for ending ALL contraception. How is that remotely sound? He talks about climate change and evolution like they are crackpot theories despite both having tons of scientific evidence behind them. This guy is a complete lunatic and idiot. He is a danger to America if he gets elected. <p> Santorum is an extremely dangerous -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of biblical law vs. humanity. There is no room for compassion or compromise in his little world, where women are chattel, sex is only for reproduction and anyone who does not believe like this is a terrorist. And he is so afraid of homosexuality, he MUST be fighting it( or secretly succumbing...) NOBODY can be that anti-gay and actually be comfortably straight. <p> The greatest problem looming on the planet, the elephant in the room that no one( except the Chinese) will talk about or try to correct, is overpopulation. It seems almost trivial if you 're not paying attention, but do the math. Each time we add more people to the total, we need resources -- food, water, housing, job, education, health services, etc. -- that we are rapidly running our of. Statistics prove that our population is growing, no one denies that. And with no attempt to curb the rise( the GOP will cite their wars as the great equalizer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonrenewable resources -- for guns, ammo and bombs) we MUST eventually overwhelm the planet 's capability to support us. And to the idiots who try to point to states like Arizona and all the empty space -- go like on a square mile of desert and support yourself and a family of four... <p> And Santorum wants to prevent us from preventing overpopulation, because his tired old mis-translated bible told him so. <p> Sociopaths are dangerous, and should be institutionalized where they can do no further damage to society. And this is the ultimate pathology, the death of the species thanks to Rick Santorum. Would n't he just LOVE it? What a great bullet point on your resume -- I was responsible for the birth of an additional 10 billion unwanted humans which overran the planet and left it barren... <p> Yeah, it 's a bit of hyperbole, but only in the ' exaggeration for emphasis ' part, the basic scenario is( must be, there is no other option) mathematically accurate, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecology. 1+1+1+1 eventually reaches a large enough number we call it infinity.( Mathematicians wo n't call it that, but for all practical purposes, once you overwhelm the support infrastructure, the rest is irrelevant.) <p> And one more point -- HEY, RIKKI-TIKKI! Homosexuality is Nature 's birth control... Suck on THAT simple fact and go get laid -- by some 19-year-old twink. You KNOW you want to... <p> Yesterday, I saw a video clip of Santorum saying the reason( or at least one of them) he wants to do away with birth control is that abortion being legal has caused too much loss of population growth, thereby not sending enough funds into the social security fund. So we must end abortion, have millions more babies, so they can fund SS.............. yes, I saw it with my own eyes. <p> Seriously, this guy is psychiatric and needs to be put away. Very dangerous theocrat-wannabe. Look at history : rule by religion has never worked out well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president who filters his every decision through the Bible. <p> Scientifically speaking, the biggest threat to human survival is the demographic winter, that is, not enough population growth to continue to sustain the developed nations. Check into this! There is plenty of provision for everyone, but
