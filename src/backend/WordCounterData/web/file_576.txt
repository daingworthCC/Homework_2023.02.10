5084541 <p> Players on the Jets ' offense have been talking the talk this week, with Mark Sanchez saying after Monday night 's win that they 're back on track. But most of the Jets ' offensive drives on Monday yielded five yards or fewer, so Sanchez may have been speaking prematurely. The Jets rank 29th in the league in total offense, and they 've punted a league-high 39 times. <p> So what 's it going to take for the Jets ' offense to go through the roof? <p> " Me and my quarterback, we have some work to do, " Burress said. " And being a competitor, you have to love the opportunity to go out and work hard and get better.... We 're not where we want to be as far as passing the football. There 's so much room for improvement, this offense can be so much better. " <p> The Jets ' offense will have to get a whole lot better before anyone would say they 've gone through the roof. <p> Translation : they will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punts. <p> @ aaronzona2011 says : Oct 20, 2011 6:22 AM is being delusional a prerequisite for being a professional athlete -- -- -- -- -- No, just a New York Jet. <p> mistrezzrachael says : Oct 20, 2011 6:52 AM <p> It 's so much better when these clowns lose... then we do n't have to listen to their BS.. AS MUCH. <p> Prerequisite for being a jet or a jet fan.... Open mouth as much as possible. Attract as much attention to yourself as possible. Rearrange the NFL calendar to win the SuperBowl every April-offseason. <p> jets were a couple bad Moore reads from being down 21-0 Monday night... great performance vs worst team in NFL.... This coming off of fireman ed 's pitiful Monday nite intro... talking about their ' great ' tradition. Yes, 2 division tittles in 40 years is great... and more than qualifies them as bottom 5 franchise in NFL history.... But you would n't know it from their mouths. <p> Newton and Dalton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 37 games. <p> cakemixa says : Oct 20, 2011 7:09 AM <p> Will this guys EVER just shut up? Rofl. <p> pkrjones says : Oct 20, 2011 7:09 AM <p> " We 're not where we want to be as far as passing the football. "... So you ARE where you want to be in the running game? Wow, not sure Shonn Green knew that this was as good as it gets... <p> tombradysbaby says : Oct 20, 2011 7:13 AM <p> Jets suck, end of story. They 'll be.500 team this year and that loud mouth buffoon they call a coach will be looking at a hotseat. <p> savocabol1 says : Oct 20, 2011 7:23 AM <p> The jets are the most bipolar team in the NFL. When they are losing everything is bad and everyone sucks. When they are winning they claim they ca n't be stopped. And they wonder why the rest of the league hates them... <p> I ca n't wait for the non-trash talking Buffalo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in the division... <p> They( Jets) ca n't stretch the field consistently, and do n't have the same dynamic running attack they had two years ago with Thomas Jones and co.. Oh, and their defense is n't all it used to be talked up to being.. <p> quittsburghstoolers says : Oct 20, 2011 7:38 AM <p> Plaxico Burress : Jets ' -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - <p> Why is that, Plax? <p> Does this mean they 've finally found a QB who DOES N'T get " happy feet " while he 's in the pocket? <p> " The more we get comfortable, we start playing pitch and catch and I 'm doing my thing out there, the offense is going to go through the roof, " Burress said. " It 's only a matter of time. "..................... Um......... no... with that QB your not!!!! <p> BernardPollardIsAnAss says : Oct 20, 2011 7:42 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done sir. If there ever were a commercial in the making for bad parenting, this is it. " I learned from watching you Rex! " <p> Since our team has enough issues, thank you for refusing our owner 's offer. Many of us wanted no part of your prima donna act again and were relieved that you passed us by. Perhaps if you ever managed to control your mouth, your ego, your sense of entitlement, and your guns, you could have been one of the greats. But it was always about you, Plax. You always felt were " the man " AND the victim at the same time. Enjoy your stay with the other team. Your empty promises, your ridiculous boasts, and your poor production make you the perfect Jet. We 'll take Hakeem Nicks over you anyday. <p> 6.5 punts a game is a lot. If we are telling the truth, the Jets offense has looked really rinky dink out there compared to others. That Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> silverdeer says : Oct 20, 2011 8:52 AM <p> Plax must figure that now that he ca n't carry a gun anymore, he needs to take it up a notch and carry explosives instead. <p> silverdeer says : Oct 20, 2011 8:57 AM <p> Another thought : " through the roof " is code for the number of wins he expects the team to get the rest of the season. Considering that the rest of the schedule contains teams with open air stadiums, with no roofs, there will be no more wins coming for them this year. <p> Pretty bold words coming from a guy whose stats project out to 38 catches for 582 yards and 6 TDs for the season. <p> nebster21 says : Oct 20, 2011 9:23 AM <p> what do you expect him to say. We are going to keep sucking. I am lucky Sanchez still targets me. Our passing game needs the run game to step it up because us recievers can not put the team on our backs. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael Smith must be moderating this comment stream. <p> thejuddstir says : Oct 20, 2011 9:33 AM <p> Who cares what an over-the-hill WR from a losing team predicts. Besides, Burress was " misquoted ", he meant to say " a bullet is gon na go thru my leg "..... dumbazz <p> **26;5503;TOOLONG says : Oct 20, 2011 9:38 AM <p> Im as big a Jets fan as you 'll ever find, and I 'm taking back by this B.S. comment of Burress 's... This offense is F'n miles from being through the roof, how about lets shut up and work on getting a GD 1st quarter 1st down before dreaming about being explosive.. And Plax how about running a NFL route instead of looking like your playing under street lights, that would be a helpful step in achieving your blast from above!!! <p> richm2256 says : Oct 20, 2011 9:45 AM <p> These guys NEVER shut up. <p> You 'd think that at 3-3, they 'd be a little more humble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than two rookies have in 6 games. <p> Their " passing game " relies on a QB that ca n't think or throw, receivers that ca n't get open or, you know, catch a football, and a coaching staff that has no intelligence or imagination on offense. <p> They have a Pop Warner running game, and a defense that is looking like they 're being worked to death. <p> I 'm sick of these idiot players -- and their HC -- coming out and telling us how good they 're GON NA be. <p> YOU 'RE THREE AND THREE, YOU BARELY BEAT THE 0-5 DOLPHINS!!!!!! <p> Do your talking on the FIELD, morons. <p> schmitty2 says : Oct 20, 2011 9:53 AM <p> Says the guy who has n't done squat all year <p> dukemarc says : Oct 20, 2011 9:55 AM <p> Have his Drops exceeded his Catches yet? <p> stanmackley says : Oct 20, 2011 9:56 AM <p> Brandon Marshall pretty much had his way with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that, drops, not passes defended by Revis. <p> Do the jets even play football anymore? You would n't know due to the constant stories about nothing. Most over-talked about team ever. Jets had their run. It was nice while it lasted but it did n't work. Move on and try to get better. That 's it. <p> Burress has never been a consistent elite receiver even when he was in his prime. I 've never read about teams game planning for him like Moss, TO, Marvin Harrison or Holmes. He was good, but he was never unstoppable. <p> Burress should eat some of those " good wings " from Buffalo. Maybe getting some sticky sause on his hands will help him finally catch something besides a bullet. <p> monropoobah says : Oct 22, 2011 6:13 AM <p> The jets are the most bipolar team in the NFL. When they are losing everything is bad and everyone sucks. When they are winning they claim they ca n't be stopped. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <p> i still wonder why everyone hates the jets. it 's remarkable really. who says everything is bad and everyone sucks? you think that 's coming from jets? jet fans?? what sucks is coming on a jets blog and having to waste so much time looking thru comments from small minded little people who have more
