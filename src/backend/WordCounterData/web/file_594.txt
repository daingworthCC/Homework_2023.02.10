5086341 <h> Public opinion of the health care law <p> Demonstrators protest on the Supreme Court stairs Thursday as they await a ruling on the constitutionality of the Affordable Healthcare Act, US President Barack Obama 's signature healthcare legislation. <p> / SAUL LOEB <p> Since it was enacted over two years ago, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, President Obama 's signature piece of legislation, has never been especially popular with the American public. Just 34 percent approve of the health care law, according to a CBS News/New York Times Poll released earlier this month, while 48 percent disapprove. Other recent polls also show more oppose the law than support it. <p> As might be expected, views on the health care law are colored by partisanship. Eight in 10 Republicans disapprove, while most Democrats( 56 percent) approve. More than half of independents( 52 percent) oppose the law. <p> Overall opinions of the health care law have barely wavered since its passage in March 2010, and support for it has never reached 50 percent in CBS News Polls. Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, 43 percent of Americans approved of the law - that 's the highest percentage to date. <p> But is this an indication that Americans are not ready for health care reform? Not necessarily. Throughout the debate over health care in 2009, CBS News Polls showed a majority of Americans wanted either fundamental changes made or a completely rebuilt health care system. A recent AP-Gfk survey asked what should happen if the health care law is ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court ; 77 say the President and Congress should start work on new health care legislation. Only 19 percent of Americans want the health care system should be left as is. <p> In fact, despite Americans ' mostly negative views of the health care law generally, there is broad public support for some specific elements of the law. A March CBS News/New York Times Poll found 85 percent favor the requirement that insurance companies cover people with pre-existing conditions, nearly seven in 10 support allowing children under 26 to say on their parents ' health plan, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discounts to reduce the Medicare prescription drug coverage gap, commonly known as the donut hole. <p> Even a majority of those who express disapproval of the health care law overall say they approve of these three elements. <p> Still, the most controversial component of the law - the requirement that nearly all Americans obtain health insurance -- does not sit well with the American public. In that same March poll, 45 percent approve of that provision, but 51 percent do not. According to an April Kaiser Family Foundation survey, seven in ten find that element of the law unfavorable <p> Also, among those who oppose the law overall in the March CBS News/New York Times Poll, seven in 10 disapprove of the mandate that people buy health insurance. <p> Even though the public is familiar with some elements of the health care law, particularly the individual mandate, there is some evidence that many may not have a good understanding of it. Soon after the law was enacted, 41 percent of Americans felt they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them, but two years later and even after some provisions were implemented, that number increased just six points to 47 percent. Just as many -- 48 percent -- now find the law confusing. And while a CBS News/New York Times Poll released earlier this month found that most know at least some details about the 2010 health care law, only 28 percent of Americans say they know a lot about it. Of that 28 percent, more than six in 10 disapprove of the law. <p> Throughout the health care debate and after the law 's passage, it seemed Americans never really saw any benefit in the law for them. More Americans consistently said the health care changes would to do more harm than good to them personally. In March of this year, only 19 percent thought the law would mostly help them ; most either said they would be hurt by it( 31 percent) or not have much of an effect( 43 percent). <p> The cost of health care is an ongoing concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline under the law. In that March poll, just 15 percent though their costs would go down because of the law ; virtually the same as the 14 percent who said that two years ago as the law was being enacted. More than half( 52 percent) expect the Affordable Care Act to increase their own health care costs. <p> Ultimately, Americans did n't see health care reform as the top priority for the country. While people wanted a better health care system, they wanted a better economy more. Since 2008, the economy has been the dominant concern for Americans, according to CBS News Polls. Throughout 2009 when health care reform was being hotly debated, health care claimed the second spot behind the economy and jobs among the public 's concerns ; however, it was always a distant second. In October 2009, 20 percent volunteered health care as the most important issue facing the country, but 45 percent said the economy and jobs. Two years later, health care is even less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times Poll, just 5 percent of Americans cite health care as the most important issue facing the country- but nearly ten times as many people choose the economy and jobs with 48 percent. <p> When we take a serious look at the current Health System after all the noise have subsided one have to conclude that the current Health Care System can not be sustained over the long term.With Health Care cost increasing at the current rate one have to conclude that it is not sustainable.Affordable Health Insurance is necessary for the health of all AMERICANS.The goal of the Affordable Care Act is reducing the cost Health care and Insuring more Americans.With more Americans having access to Individual Health Insurance we will hopefully help to reduce the long term cost of Health Care.In Florida and all other states cost of care have to be evaluated and new system introduce to deliver Health Care at a lower cost. <p> Yeah, nobody cares about healthcare till something happens to them. Then they walk into the ER and get it for free. <p> By the way, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rebate from the insurance cronies who ripped them off. That 's another good thing about Obamacare, insurance cronies ca n't just raise you rates to pump up their stock price anymore. That 's why the GOP got fire in their eyes, they do n't want anything happening to their campaign contributors profits. <p> The law has instilled a sense of fear and confusion among the public who are not exactly sure of the likely implications of the healthcare reform bill. Its analysis has unveiled what is in it and what is not, and what the law can do and can not do. What is now definitely known is that : <p> The healthcare law will no doubt increase the number of Americans with health insurance but it will fall short of the so-called " universal coverage. " A rough estimate is that by 2019, nearly 21 million Americans will be uninsured The cost of the legislation will be much more than originally announced. It is expected to cost more than $2.7 trillion over 10 years of full implementation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! A vast majority of the workers and businesses will notice very little, or in fact, no change in their already escalating insurance costs. But millions of other Americans including the younger and healthier workforce, and those who buy insurance through the non-group market companies will see their premiums rise faster There is a huge possibility that the law could raise taxes by more than $669 billion by 2019 causing a reduction in economic growth and employment Due to the rationing of care that will come about, it will interfere with how doctors practice medicine Even if people are happy with their insurance now, they may not be able to keep it... http : **30;2581;TOOLONG... <p> If people really did take the time to understand the decision, those who were initially happy with the decision might not be as enthusiastic. And more importantly, those who were initially disappointed might actually be very, very happy with the decision. It reveals the shadowy outlines of an outer limit to Congress ' power under the Commerce and Necessary and Proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of federal regulatory power. While the Affordable Care Act legislation itself is important, the truly groundbreaking outcome of the Court 's decision is that it rejected those two sources of Congressional power as justifications for upholding the law. <p> Continue reading our take on this issue over at The Corporate Observer( http : **34;2613;TOOLONG... <p> Approval of the Affordable Care Act today by the Supreme Court is a remarkable result. <p> It is remarkable that the Court, and especially its Chief Justice, did not apparently consider either the Congressional hearings and testimony, nor the President 's own statements that the mandate WAS NOT considered by them to be a tax. Since only the Congress can levy a tax, and the Congress did not consider the Mandate a tax, it seems that Court, through Roberts, has decided for the American people that it is a tax after all, and despite their wishes. <p> It is also remarkable that the Court majority went to such lengths to discuss the issues raised in the suits, including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true constitutional issues in dispute, dismissed them, and went on to fashion its own law as it saw fit. <p> The Solicitor General did raise the issue of the mandate penalty being considered a tax, but the administration he represented, both before, and after the oral arguments, and the president himself, continued to argue that no taxing function was involved. Does n't that make Obama look like a premeditated liar, since his own promises to the American people were directly contrary to the decision pushed by his own representative? <p> Today is not a good day in our history ; we have a running mouth president, and a law-creating Court, supported by an equally incompetent Congress and Senate. American needs major change to survive! <p> The Supreme Court, in their ruling on Obamacare this morning, said this to the citizens of the United States - paraphrased, of course : <p> Obamacare is not unconstitutional because it is a form of taxing the U.S. citizen and taxing the U.S. is constitutional. We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are not saying it is bad for the U.S. ; we are only saying that it is constitutional as a tax on the U.S. If U. S. citizens do n't like this, it is up to THEM, the citizens, to put people in office who will repeal it - not because it is unconstitutional, but because it is not cost-effective, it is not going to solve any of the healthcare problems we face, and because it is not good for the majority of the U.S. citizens. <p> Folks, Obama said that there would be no taxes on people who made under $250 K a year. Here is the SUPREME LAW OF OUR LAND CALLING OBAMA A BALL-FACED LIAR! WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED TO VOTE HIM OUT OF OFFICE? <p> i do nt see any logical content in there... maybe if you would stop flaming and start explaining your oppinion( which i think you cant because it sounds like right-wing-propaganda in my ears) people would understand you... but thats not point of beeing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody else... even if you tell them complete rubish you heard by some rich people working in theire own intressts... shame on you <p>( spelling or gramer mistakes are made because im a legastenic and because i grew up in germany... only because i know youre going to start **tching about it) <p> by the way obama is everything else than a socialist. look at the german political system... the free and social market economy... it made germanys economy to one of the strongest in the world... and if you look on the map germany is pretty tiny if you compare it with the usa, china or the other states at the top of the list. And you might know most germans hate kommunists because of the cold war, which was pretty tough in germany. finaly : protecting the consumer isnt a bad thig... but thats a thing you " true Americans "( ;)) have to learn first <p> Jimant60! You must be some constitutional scholar, since you fancy yourself better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and the POTUS, who was editor of the Harvard Law Review and, after graduating Magna *** Laude, went on to teach constitutional law for 12 years at the University of Chicago Law School). Here 's a news flash : those who have insurance ALREADY PAY FOR THOSE WHO DO N'T. Sometime when you 're not busy boning up on constitutional provisions, try investigating how we( yes, we) pay for uncompensated( fyi, that means unpaid) care in the United States. By the way, I do not receive government freebies, which MUST make me a liberal, thank God! <p> Lots of conservatives moaning and groaning. Little do they know conservatives in our fellow industrialized nations have made this change in their health care systems years ago. The costs of US health care, in their present state, are very poorly architected, too expensive and arguably a fine case of financial fraud. <p> One only need to study the documentary below very closely to realize the scandal in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world <p> Part 1 : http : //www.youtube.com/watch? v=UziyxAkw... <p> Part 2 : http : //www.youtube.com/watch? v=4OTKwah... <p> I challenge any conservative, even one with a degree in fiancial accounting or mathematics, to closely study this documentary, do some math and provide a rational response for the rest of the community. <p> There is no question this case was closely studied by Chief Justice John Roberts. He knew this decision would not only make or break his legacy, but also determine the fate of MILLIONS of Americans. At the end of the day he voted with his heart and his brain. He also arguably voted with his conscience. <p> There has been BILLIONS of dollars spent in lobbying by the health care industry to sway our members of Congress. This lobbying has corrupted our political system. Anyone who denies this is a player in the system. Anyone who recognizes it is speaking the truth. <p> American needs a better health care system. Period. <p> As they say in the military : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way. Right now the GOP is in the way, and they have been for the last several years. Any rational American who can research and study the issues on their own will realize Republicans always offer its citizens the short end of the stick. Why? Their livlihoods depend on it. <p> I do n't care if the law is good or bad... the fact that a majority of Americans do not want it yet it still exists as a law is frightening. When the law was passed two years ago I was immediately laid off with hundreds of others... now you will see thousands more. <p> I agree completely, America needs a better health care system. The provisions of this bill are right on, pre-exsisting conditions should be covered, preventive treatments should be covered also along with several other provisions. My issues is that this law accomplishes these things by legislating huge profits for the insurance industry. Who was the genius that thought requiring the insurance companies to take on more risk was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the risk pool will only serve to increase insurance profits, not reduce costs. And who is going to be impacted the most? The middle class. Middle class America is going to be most affected by this law with huge increases in insurance premiums. It is the middle class family that will do without a vacation, cut back on maintaining their homes, not buy new clothes because their health insurance, that they are responsible enought to keep is so expensive. Bravo Congress, bravo Demoncrats, bravo President Obama, look at all you have accomplished!! Bill Clinton, a strong health care reform advocate, recognized before he was elected that we need insurance reform. The law is a terrible law, the goal a good one. We need better people in Congress, Republicans and Democrats! Throw out the current crop and let 's bring in a new one, they could n't be any worse. <p> Of those who oppose the Affordable Care Act, at least a third oppose it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( like the woman in the picture at the top of this article and a couple of commenters here). Of those who oppose the mandate, at least a third oppose it because they do n't want to have to pay money to ANY insurer. So anyone who thinks ALL opponents of ACA or the mandate are going to be voting
