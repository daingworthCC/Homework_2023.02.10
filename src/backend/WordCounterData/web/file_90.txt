5035541 <p> Without any evidence, many prominent media outlets -- from The Atlantic Wire to New York magazine -- were speculating that Paula Broadwell 's husband was the person who had written a letter to that weekly advice column last summer, concerned about his wife 's extramarital affair with David H. Petraeus, the former general and now former C.I.A. director. <p> Twitter was abuzz, too. How delicious, the notion went, that a situation so fraught with high-level figures would have been treated in an advice column to a newspaper months before. <p> Then came a definitive-sounding Twitter message from the magazine 's editor, Hugo Lindgren. The rumor had been fact-checked and it was false, he said. This was duly sent around the globe in further Twitter messages, and the rumor died a relatively quiet death. <p> Some readers( and a blogger for The New Republic) have questioned this move. One reader, Lou Kramberg, was among them. He wrote to me : <p> A New York Times editor has denied that a letter to the Ethicist last summer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an affair with General Petraeus. The sender requested that his name be withheld and it was withheld by the Ethicist. Let us assume that the letter was indeed sent by another husband and let us suppose that a similar incident occurs in the future. Only this time, the letter writer is indeed the husband of the accused woman. Any response other than a false denial would be in violation of the wishes of the writer to have their name withheld. Would n't it have been better in the Petraeus situation for The Times to have stated that they would not ask the Ethicist who wrote the letter as a matter of confidentiality and leave it at that? <p> Did the editor reveal exactly who the person in the July 13 column was? No. But he did reveal who it was n't. That seems like a deal breaker of the trust that reader-submitters have when writing to advice columnists. Unless the advisee expressly offers details about their life, it seems the adviser should have no comment on any such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's still a revelation. And, without putting too fine a point on it, the non-announcement sets a terrible precedent. Should a similar situation involving the anonymity of advice column patients happen again, people will demand confirmation of identity -- and assume that the editor 's silence means they are on the right track. <p> I asked both Mr. Lindgren and The Times 's standards editor, Philip B. Corbett, about the denial. Both said that the decision was a carefully considered one, and one that they had discussed with Dean Baquet, a managing editor. <p> " The point of my denial on Twitter was to provide accurate information, " Mr. Lindgren said. " There was a great deal of speculation out there that this letter had been written by Paula Broadwell 's husband, and since we had good reason to believe that was n't true, I said so. " <p> As for what might happen in the future, both editors said that it 's hard to address a hypothetical situation. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while respecting the confidentiality of those to whom it has been promised, " Mr. Lindgren said. <p> Mr. Corbett said : " It 's tricky. This is an unusual situation and it 's difficult to extrapolate. " <p> Does this in any way suggest that The Times wo n't protect its news sources? No. A person who writes to an advice columnist expects not to have his or her name revealed but is, as Mr. Corbett noted, " not a confidential source in the classic sense. " <p> The editors did not reveal an identity, or make any promises about what they would do in a future situation. <p> They chose to quell a rumor for the sake of accuracy, and without breaking trust with the letter-writer. <p> It 's a close call. The opposing argument has merit, particularly because the editors ' decision may seem to set a precedent. But, given the specifics of this situation, I think that Times editors made a reasonable decision. <p> Update : Grantland published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, with his take on the letter, his response and
