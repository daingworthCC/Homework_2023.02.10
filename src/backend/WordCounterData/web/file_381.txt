5064941 <h> Who 's a Better Driver : Mom or Dad? <p> Tue, Nov 13, 2012 7:14 PM EST - 2:46 <p> Parents, if you 've ever wondered what your children thought of your driving... here 's your answer. An Australian car website surveyed 1,000 children aged five to seven in order to find out what makes an awesome child-sized road trip. Apparently, these kids love candy, trips to Grandma 's house, and oh, 51% of them think that Dad is a better driver. But Mom has special qualities too! Plus, in our second story, Jimmy Choo makes $15,000 purses that look like Teletubbies. Want one? <h> 263 comments <p> Gee, my wife seems to think I do n't pay attention to my driving because I 'm always scanning my mirrors, as well as looking at both sides of the road, immediately in front of the car, and up to a couple hundred feet ahead of the car. And of course, if I 'm doing the speed limit, I, m going to get a ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, 15 over the posted limit is too slow. <p> My wife gets mad at me if we 're driving on the highway and the car in front of me puts his brakes on and I do n't immediately put mine on. Reason I do n't have to, I do n't tailgate, there 's always enough room for me to simply let off the gas and coast to a stop. Only had to change my brakes once and I have 182,000 on my 2006 Z71. <p> every thing is fine, until my chick starts talking, then she forgets she is driving, I have to tell her to hush herself, when we blow past our destination, she then gets mad at me, of course, chicks are too emo to drive and should be grounded!!! <p> My girlfriend acknowledges that I am the better driver and makes me drive everywhere. I have a hard time not using the imaginary wheel/brakes when someone else is driving me around too... so it 's just a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he 's old enough to have an opinion... I hardly think 2 is a good enough time to make a judgement call! <p> Clark : I think you 're all #$%$/ed in the head. We 're ten hours from the #$%$/in fun park and you want to bail out. Well I 'll tell you something. This is no longer a vacation. It 's a quest. It 's a quest for fun. I 'm gon na have fun and you 're gon na have fun. We 're all gon na have so much #$%$/in fun we 'll need plastic surgeory to remove our godamn smiles. You 'll be whistling ' Zip-A-Dee Doo-Dah ' out of you 're azzzzhols! I got ta be crazy! I 'm on a pilgrimage to see a moose. Praise Marty Moose! Holy Chit! <p> yeah, no kidding! i was surprised to find this article. you really call this news? ok, yes there are plenty of #$%$ women drivers. i 'm a dude and i can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training. we get it here at work and it 's a lot of help to douches that suck at driving <p> More skillful driver? Definitely my dad. Better? Mom takes gold there. I never see my mother blow past stop signs and around blind corners. She sticks to her lane and drives the speed limit, and she stays well back from other cars. Whenever I ride with my dad
