5056841 <p> Could the end be near for America Online? The online service that was once synonymous with " online " may have finally shot itself in the foot one to many times. <p> Even after a decade of lousy customer service, poor treatment of employees, lackluster technology, and shortsighted management, it may be a single, incredibly stupid decision that brings the house down. <p> During the week of August 6, some people in AOL 's research division decided to release to the public a little database they had. It contained a list of about 658,000 users and the Web searches each made from March to May. If you were one of those lucky, randomly selected souls, every search term you entered was opened to the world. <p> AOL did n't tell its users it could do this, nor that it was going to, and it did n't offer anyone the opportunity to opt out. It did take a small step back from the abyss by substituting a number for the users ' screen names. <p> " So what? " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was me searching for " dwarf prostitutes in south dakota " what difference does it make? " <p> The problem is that searches are n't anonymous, even if the screen names were withheld to protect the innocent. The New York Times proved this when it tracked down user 4417749, one Thelma Arnold of Lilburn, Ga., from her searches. <p> And you do n't need the resources of the Times. Even a part-time technology columnist of average intelligence can glean plenty from the database. <p> The tool of choice : AOL Search Database, created by University of Pennsylvania student Danny Zhao and his friend Teren Sapp at Michigan Tech. Zhao and Sapp knew an opportunity the moment it popped up. <p> " As soon as I read that AOL has publicly released these search logs, " Zhao told me, " I realized immediately that the majority of people on the Web would n't really care for downloading and going through two gigabytes of search data themselves. " <p> So in a matter of a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created a search tool for it, and put up a website that 's incredibly easy to use. In less than a week, they had about 100,000 unique visitors. <p> " I imagine most of these are technophiles, " he said, " since it 's hard to imagine a layman having a lot of interest in something like this. " <p> Laymen? How about law enforcement? <p> You are what you seek <p> Looking at someone 's searches can tell you a lot, as The New York Times proved. It showcased a friendly, benign person who did n't mind being tracked down. But others are n't quite so clean. <p> Take user 5450953. He apparently has a taste for kiddie porn, based on his searches for " lolita nudes, " " underground kiddy porn pictures, " " russianpreteennudes, " and, most disturbingly, " see girls and animals having sex. " <p> Who is he? Let 's narrow it down. He appears to own a 2004 Corvette( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ") and lives near Baltimore( " see telephone number of old wheel world in Baltimore "). He 's also planning a trip to Vegas( " see the weather in las vegas " and " see showtime tours in las vegas "). <p> That might be enough information for people who know him -- " Hey, does n't Steve own a ' Vette, and did n't he just come back from Vegas? " For a cop, that might be enough to start tracking him down. There ca n't be that many 2004 Corvettes in the Baltimore area, and it 's probably easy to cross-check the list with the Transportation Security Administration 's database of flyers. <p> And remember, because AOL made those searches public, the cops do n't even need a court order to get it. <p> I might prefer to spend my time on user 3187193, though. In a three-month period, he made more than 1380 searches, almost all on terms such as : " young kids prelolitas nude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard drive that 's just waiting to become a local TV news story. <p> If you 're a landlord in Bangor, Maine, you might want to watch out for user 577528, who is apparently apartment hunting there. But in between searches for a home in the Pine Tree state, our Mr. 577528 was interested in " how to make home made bombs, " " how to make a meth lab, " and " www.morbiddeaths.com. " Stephen King, are you reading this? <p> And if you 're Arizona artist Barbara Bayla Cohen, you might want to lay low. Besides searching on Cohen 's name and " barbara bayla cohen personal website, " user 1029483 had almost a dozen searches on things like " torture " and " torture methods. " He 's also planning a trip to Sedona, judging by searches on " arizona golf courses " and " sedona weather forecast. " <p> The Olsen twins should watch out, too. User 4967938, who may hail from Drexel Hill, Pa. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashley ", " mary-kate and ashley.com, " and " how to make a bomb. " <p> User 23269287, probably from Monte Vista Colorado, is evidently having troubles with the local fauna. His searches include " how to make a cat trap, " " how to make a racoon trap " sic, and " how to make traps to keep people out. " <p> Finally, you have to feel for user 11989240, who apparently lives near Abilene, Texas. Over three months, he searched on " how to take the sting out of a sunburn, " " home remedies for gout, " and " home remedy for ingrown hair. " Oh, and " how to grow pot. " <p> This is why, when the Department of Justice wanted Google to release its searches, Google fought back -- and users raised an uproar. People realize that you do n't need a name to know who someone is ; search terms are often more than enough. <p> I guess the folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kantor is a technology writer, pundit, and know-it-all who covers technology for the Roanoke Times. He 's also a former editor for PC Magazine and Internet World. Read more of his work
