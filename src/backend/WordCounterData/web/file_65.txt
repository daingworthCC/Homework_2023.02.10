5033041 <h> Returning to Ravnica... Again <p> The time has once again come to look back at my set review and weigh the good and the bad to see where I measure up. The set is relatively new still, and so some of the higher prices have not adjusted, and some of the sleepers may yet still be slumbering, but nonetheless, it is time to see where we stand. If you heeded my advice during spoiler season and wrote down your predictions, it is time to dust them off and see just how accurate we were. I will run down the same list I did in these articles so we can directly compare predictions versus actual prices. <p> Angel of Serenity -- Of all the called shots I made for this set, this is by and far the one I was the least accurate on. I predicted that the card would break into reanimator but would not see play otherwise. I could not have been more wrong, as Angel now dominates the format with her pal Thragtusk. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this guy to see play in some W/x aggro as soon as the format came out, and then he 'd potentially spike. Although there was a brief spike when W/U aggro started doing well after States, it was short-lived, as the W/U Flash variant took over, leaving this guy in the dust. I can see his price spiking back to $4 on and off through his time in Standard, but for now, I was certainly a little high on my prediction. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $4 <p> $2 <p> Cyclonic Rift -- Finally a card I was right in there on. I saw this seeing play as a way for control to slam the door on aggro in the late game, and it seems it has also proved to be a useful tool in the mirror matches in addition to allowing you to bounce Angels and planeswalkers alike. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $4 <p> $3.5 <p> Jace, Architect of Thought -- I am pretty happy to say Jace exceeded even my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risen even higher than I had originally predicted. Although he is currently $35 retail, his auction price can be found as low as $25 quite regularly, leading me to believe his retail number may drop soon enough. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $22 <p> $35 <p> Sphinx of the Chimes -- This was one of my more off-the-wall called shots from this set, as I had hoped a deck able to use this in conjunction with Veilborn Ghoul would arise. Alas, I was incorrect, and it does not seem this guy will be rising from the bulk bin any time soon. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $3 <p> $.50 <p> Desecration Demon -- Boy did this guy plummet to the depths of the bulk bin. I still have high hopes for the Demon, so I have been picking them up for cheap when I can. After looking at the price, I was surprised to see they have even held $3 with as little play as they have been seeing. <p> Prediction : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- This one tanked even harder than I expected, but I feel that over time, this will increase due to Commander and casual crowds. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $2 <p> $.50 <p> Necropolis Regent -- This has gone about as expected, and I see the price holding just above bulk. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $2 <p> $2.50 <p> Underworld Connections -- Although it has seen some play over the past few months, this card is proving to be no Phyrexian Arena. I do n't expect a sharp increase any time soon, but I do see people still trying to make the card work. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $5 <p> $1.50 <p> Ash Zealot -- This card has been slowly creeping back onto people 's radars and has ended right on where I predicted. With the popularity of mono-red, I could see another small spike, but I am probably going to dump any I have now. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $5 <p> $5 <p> Guild Feud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which has not been delved into in Modern ; however, I also make some wild shots. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $2 <p> $.50 <p> Utvara Hellkite -- This dropped slightly lower than I thought it would. As expected, though, it has held value from the casual players and collectors <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $4 <p> $2.50 <p> Deadbridge Goliath -- Being released as a promo killed the price on this guy, and his lack of play has given me no reason to believe that will change any time soon. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $4 <p> $1 <p> Abrupt Decay -- I fully believe I was right on the money with this card, and I expect it to stay stable around where it is now. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $10 <p> $8 <p> Armada Wurm -- It seems the multicolored calls were far closer to their current values and reasoning, Armada Wurm being right in there as well. <p> Detention Sphere -- I was correct in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low on the price. I expected Zombies to keep down control more than it did, and I therefore undervalued this card in the current format. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $6 <p> $8 <p> Dreadbore -- I expected this to be in Zombies, but when that fell, I expected the price to tank. Luckily, Jund has become a major metagame player, leaving Dreadbore with a home in Standard. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $6 <p> $8 <p> Epic Experiment -- I certainly did n't see this card coming in Standard, instead expecting Modern results. The price still holds steady at $4, but just like Past in Flames, it may skyrocket one day or it may sink slowly to the bottom of your bulk. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $7 <p> $4 <p> Isperia, Supreme Judge -- So far, Isperia has managed to stay above bulk, but her lack of play is already catching up. I do n't believe what I mentioned about being a conditional one- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the current format. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $4 <p> $2 <p> Jarad, Golgari Lich Lord -- The normal version is down to $3, while the Duel Decks copy is still $6. I still believe he has not found a home, and if that continues, I can see the price dropping even further. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $5 <p> $3 or $6 <p> Lotleth Troll -- This guy saw as much play as I expected but has tanked far quicker than I predicted. The fact that Zombies never became the dominating force everyone predicted never gave the Troll enough time to shine. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $12 <p> $6 <p> Loxodon Smiter -- I am surprised this card has held such a reasonable value over the past few months. The G/W aggro deck helped his popularity, but unless Rakdos 's Return continues to gain popularity, I see Smiter falling out of favor. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $3 <p> $5 <p> Niv-Mizzet, Dracogenius -- I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jammed in more U/R midrange or control decks. If you have ever untapped with this guy, you know the definition of driver 's seat. There is no way this guy does n't hit $15 somewhere in his Standard life. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $15 <p> $5 <p> Rakdos, Lord of Riots -- This one has been relatively accurate. The B/R suicide deck that has sported Rakdos has shown to be fringe-playable but still shows up occasionally. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $4 <p> $5 <p> Rakdos 's Return -- I have been on this card from the beginning, and it has proven to be among the scarier cards control can tap out to cast. Jund and other midrange decks have even taken to main-decking Return to great success. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $6 <p> $10 <p> Sphinx 's Revelation -- Revelation is among the worst cards to ever see resolve as an aggro player. Not only did the opponent just Fog you, but he also drew three-plus cards. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match over this card. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $6 <p> $10 <p> Supreme Verdict -- A card like this will ebb and flow through the price scale over its life in Standard. The Legacy applications will always make it worth picking up if ever the price should be near bulk. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $4 <p> $6 <p> Trostani, Selesnya 's Voice -- I was a bit surprised when I reread this article to discover I was not a huge fan of this card. I 've been impressed with Trostani ever since I started playing her in G/W/x midrange variants, and I can not believe she is only $8 right now, much less ever $4. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $4 <p> $8 <p> Vraska the Unseen -- As expected, this price has plummeted over the past few months, just now finally crawling into the sideboards of some midrange variants. I am sure that at some point, her price will spike, but as of now, I see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> $16 <p> $12 <p> Wayfaring Temple -- Without a deck, this card is floundering. Nothing has shown to be quite good enough for any serious competitive play. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $3 <p> $1 <p> Deathrite Shaman -- It seems everyone has been on this card lately due to the boom in grave-based decks. I do n't expect his price to hold for long, so you should dump them now while you can if you have no use for them. I believe this card will always hold value and continue to grow over time, but you will be able to pick them up cheaper in a few months. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $6 <p> $12 <p> Growing Ranks -- Unfortunately, fringe play has kept this card from hitting bulk. Given time, I do believe this will obtain about the same price as Parallel Lives. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $3 <p> $1.50 <p> Nivmagus Elemental -- I was happy to dump the few copies I had when they showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all did the same. I do n't see many brave souls wanting to pilot that or any similar deck any time soon. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $3 <p> $2 <p> Chromatic Lantern -- This card has seen less play than I expected, but the price seems to have stabilized for now. Expect the price to climb upward slowly as a continual staple in Commander. <p> Prediction : <p> Actual : <p> $7 <p> $4 <p> Whew, I am surprised I was able to fit all of the thoughts into one article this time. I am sorry I cut some of the explanations short to conserve space, but most of them do n't really need me to describe what you already know.

A regular face at major US events, he can usually be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top tables for the latest deck tech. <p> When I look at financial value in mtg, I always look at the casual aspect of it first. I try to pick cards, that are generally very cheap because they do n't see play in standard( or modern or legacy), and then horde as many of them as I can find -- always buying in bulk. I look at cards and decide how they will influence the casual crowd over the years. Remembering that casual cards never rotate, and have no banned list. For example, I already have gone deep in on parallel lives, when it was bulk, darksteel plate, ascetisism, grave betrayal, etc. These cards will all be valuable to casual players over time, and as the supply shortens out, they increase in value. plus, you never know when one of these cards might hit in modern or legacy... <h> Videos <p> GatheringMagic.com, which used to be ManaNation.com, is a website about Magic : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gathering, the mana symbols, the tap symbol and all other related images are owned by Wizards of the
