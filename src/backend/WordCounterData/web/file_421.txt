5068941 <p> New Orleans Saints tight end Jimmy Graham knew the epitome of tight end greatness was playing for the Atlanta Falcons with sure-fire Hall of Famer Tony Gonzalez playing about as well as ever in what looks to be his 16th and final season in the NFL. <p> Instead of shying away from the " Graham vs. Gonzalez " billing, Graham embraced it and used it as motivation in the old clich of anything you can do, I can do better in the Saints ' 31-27 win over the Falcons on Sunday at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome. <p> Gonzalez dominated the Saints ' defense for 11 catches for 122 yards and two touchdowns. Graham dominated the Falcons ' defense with seven receptions for 146 yards and two TDs. And Graham had zero trouble admitting he wanted to one-up Gonzalez every time the Falcons tight end made a play. <p> " Tony, he kind of made the way for me, " Graham said. " It seems like you go out every drive and kind of going up against the things he did in the last drive. It 's definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I look up to. I spent a lot of time with him this offseason. No tight end plays the game like he does. The fact he 's done it for so long is simply amazing.

And then one day, I went up there and it just was n't happening. And so there 's going to be a time when you go up there and dunk it and it just is n't going to happen. ' " <p> Graham 's rebuttal : " That 'll never happen. I 'm 6-7. Even one day when I 'm 295 pounds I 'm still going to be able to dunk.( The day he ca n't dunk over the goal post) That will never I happen. I wo n't let it. " <p> BREES, COLSTON MAKING HISTORY : Brees kept rewriting the record books Sunday, while Marques Colston is on the verge of doing so. <p> Brees pushed his consecutive game streak with a touchdown pass to 52 games with his 29-yard TD connection with Graham. <p> Colston tied Saints great Deuce McAllister for the most touchdowns in franchise history as Colston 's 7-yard TD reception in
