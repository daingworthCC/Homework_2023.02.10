5063141 <h> Soaring Import Penetration Slows US Economic Growth and Job Creation <p> Welcome to Trade Ticker - the web 's only up-to-the-second counter for the U.S. Trade Deficit. <p> What does this number actually mean? The number above represents the U.S. trade deficit, up until this second, for the year 2012. A trade deficit is a calculation of the difference between the goods and services Americans sell to foreigners and the goods and services that Americans purchase from foreigners. A trade deficit with one country or in one year is not necessarily worrisome, and according to standard economic theory, will correct itself over time. But the theory has been proved wrong over the last 30 years as the United States has run consistent and increasing trade deficits. The enormous size of the trade deficits over the last several years raises the possibility of a severe international economic crisis should foreigners begin to dump the dollars they hold in world currency markets. The trade deficit is calculated on an annual basis, so the number above was $0.00 on January 1st, 2012. <p> How is it calculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published to the general public approximately two months after the last day of the month. For example, the final trade deficit for January 2001 was published in March 2001. The Trade Ticker records the monthly trade deficit when it is published, and calculates the number above, to the nearest second. The running total for the year is calculated, then the average increment per second is added for every second since the release of the latest figures. <p> The number looks like a lot of money, but what does it mean for me? Thousands of U.S. layoffs occur every week. You only have to look at **27;6594;TOOLONG news section to see the number of US jobs that are being cut across a wide range of industries. A high percentage of these layoffs are as a direct result of competition from foreign companies. Eventually, as more and more money leaves the U.S., our businesses will be powerless to prevent further such activity. <p> Monthly Trade Figures Since January 2003 <p> Month <p> US Trade Deficit( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2012 <p> $43,790 <p> July 2012 <p> $42,446 <p> June 2012 <p> $41,899 <p> May 2012 <p> $47,596 <p> April 2012 <p> $49,826 <p> March 2012 <p> $51,647 <p> February 2012 <p> $44,507 <p> January 2012 <p> $52,209 <p> December 2011 <p> $50,421 <p> November 2011 <p> $47,542 <p> October 2011 <p> $43,121 <p> September 2011 <p> $44,009 <p> August 2011 <p> $45,091 <p> July 2011 <p> $45,613 <p> June 2011 <p> $51,774 <p> May 2011 <p> $50,210 <p> April 2011 <p> $43,231 <p> March 2011 <p> $46,059 <p> February 2011 <p> $45,381 <p> January 2011 <p> $47,521 <p> December 2010 <p> $40,264 <p> November 2010 <p> $38,239 <p> October 2010 <p> $38,227 <p> September 2010 <p> $44,079 <p> August 2010 <p> $46,316 <p> July 2010 <p> $42,226 <p> June 2010 <p> $49,941 <p> May 2010 <p> $41,996 <p> April 2010 <p> $40,571 <p> March 2010 <p> $39,506 <p> February 2010 <p> $39,718 <p> January 2010 <p> $34,647 <p> December 2009 <p> $39,902 <p> November 2009 <p> $36,114 <p> October 2009 <p> $32,933 <p> September 2009 <p> $35,281 <p> August 2009 <p> $29,938 <p> July 2009 <p> $31,165 <p> June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2009 <p> $28,440 <p> March 2009 <p> $28,816 <p> February 2009 <p> $26,504 <p> January 2009 <p> $36,901 <p> December 2008 <p> $48,165 <p> November 2008 <p> $54,259 <p> October 2008 <p> $58,030 <p> September 2008 <p> $58,135 <p> August 2008 <p> $60,244 <p> July 2008 <p> $62,505 <p> June 2008 <p> $59,135 <p> May 2008 <p> $59,790 <p> April 2008 <p> $60,498 <p> March 2008 <p> $56,491 <p> February 2008 <p> $60,573 <p> January 2008 <p> $57,856 <p> December 2007 <p> $57,896 <p> November 2007 <p> $62,408 <p> October 2007 <p> $57,586 <p> September 2007 <p> $56,945 <p> August 2007 <p> $56,729 <p> July 2007 <p> $58,895 <p> June 2007 <p> $59,983 <p> May 2007 <p> $60,274 <p> April 2007 <p> $59,213 <p> March 2007 <p> $63,035 <p> February 2007 <p> $58,228 <p> January 2007 <p> $57,356 <p> December 2006 <p> $61,453 <p> November 2006 <p> $58,214 <p> October 2006 <p> $58,926 <p> September 2006 <p> $64,603 <p> August 2006 <p> $68,915 <p> July 2006 <p> $67,882 <p> June 2006 <p> $64,695 <p> May 2006 <p> $65,340 <p> April 2006 <p> $63,598 <p> March 2006 <p> $62,266 <p> February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2005 <p> $65,074 <p> November 2005 <p> $64,462 <p> October 2005 <p> $67,836 <p> September 2005 <p> $65,585 <p> August 2005 <p> $58,462 <p> July 2005 <p> $57,355 <p> June 2005 <p> $59,130 <p> May 2005 <p> $55,971 <p> April 2005 <p> $57,681 <p> March 2005 <p> $53,754 <p> February 2005 <p> $60,114 <p> January 2005 <p> $58,267 <p> December 2004 <p> $54,672 <p> November 2004 <p> $58,977 <p> October 2004 <p> $55,574 <p> September 2004 <p> $51,939 <p> August 2004 <p> $54,195 <p> July 2004 <p> $51,331 <p> June 2004 <p> $54,894 <p> May 2004 <p> $48,472 <p> April 2004 <p> $48,406 <p> March 2004 <p> $46,966 <p> Feb 2004 <p> $45,834 <p> Jan 2004 <p> $46,053 <p> Dec 2003 <p> $43,742 <p> Nov 2003 <p> $39,559 <p> Oct 2003 <p> $41,126 <p> Sept 2003 <p> $41,645 <p> Aug 2003 <p> $40,125 <p> Jul 2003 <p> $40,929 <p> Jun 2003 <p> $39,882 <p> May 2003 <p> $40,792 <p> April 2003 <p> $42,176 <p> Mar 2003 <p> $43,543 <p> Feb 2003 <p> $40,073 <p> Jan 2003 <p> $41,218 <p> American Economic Alerts in your Mailbox <p> Sign up below to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
