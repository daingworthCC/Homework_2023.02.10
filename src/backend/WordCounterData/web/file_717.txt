5098841 <h> College Stars May Have Been Ineligible <p> Court documents filed as part of an agent 's suits against several of the nation 's top college football players contain promissory notes for several thousand dollars signed by the players. If the signatures are valid, the players violated college rules and should have been ineligible to play. <p> The players include such all-Americans as Brent Fullwood, the Auburn running back ; Rod Woodson, a cornerback from Purdue, and Tony Woods, a defensive lineman from the University of Pittsburgh. All were clients of Norby Walters, a New York-based agent. <p> Under National Collegiate Athletic Association rules, a player receiving payments or entering into an agreement with an agent loses any further eligibility in the sport involved. Penalizing the players is impossible now because all have exhausted their college eligibility. Although the schools can be penalized, such penalties are generally not invoked, N.C.A.A. officials said. <p> ' ' Unless the institution had knowledge that there was contact between the student-athlete and the agent, it 's unlikely you can tie the institution into it, ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the N.C.A.A. Schools Investigate <p> Each of the five schools involved -two players from Florida and one from Clemson are also being sued by Walters - have conducted investigations. Most declined to divulge what they had found, saying they had turned the information over to their conferences or to the N.C.A.A. <p> An exception was Pittsburgh, where the athletic director, Dr. Roy Bozik, said that Woods had acknowledged taking money during his playing career. <p> ' ' Tony admitted it to us, ' ' Bozik said. ' ' We played with an ineligible player, without our knowledge, and we 've reported it to the N.C.A.A. ' ' <p> Walters is also the agent at the center of an investigation by the F.B.I. into alleged threats made by him and an associate against players and agents. Walters denied making the threats or having any knowledge of them. Suits Against 6 Players <p> Walters has said that he signed agreements to represent as many as 20 top college players and that ' ' a few ' ' of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining. Though Walters would not identify those who took money, he has filed suit against six players, charging that each failed to repay loans and breached representation agreements with him. <p> Each of his lawsuits, filed in New York State Supreme Court in recent weeks, contains contracts dated Jan. 2, 1987 - the first day that senior players could sign such agreements under N.C.A.A. rules. However, each suit also contains copies of loan agreements for several thousand dollars that were dated at various times before the most recent football season. Each agreement carries the name of a player and a signature, purported to be that of the player. Each of the loan agreements says the money was to be repaid through the player 's earnings in professional football. <p> The promissory notes were fairly uniform. The suit against Fullwood, for example, says he took $4,000 last Aug. 20, before the football season began. The note bears the signature ' ' Brent Fullwood.
