I wanted this book since the day I spotted it in the bookstore, but held off because of the price. I was particularly anxious to see the 2 CDs. But the cartoons are all LOW RESOLUTION--what a disappointment. I can understand why--they do n't want people to be able to print high-res versions... to still have to go to their website if they want to do that. But they should have announced that on the cover. Really--it is almost sinful. What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreadable some of the cartoons are because of the LOW-RESOLUTION. Really disgusting. <p> i have a very advanced, nearly state of the art cpu and monitor. i ca n't read the captions on the most of the cartoons. they 're pertectly legible if i print them out, but that 's hardly a sensible solution. <p> the other part of the low rating is the size of the book. obviously, the book industry has become infatuated with huge tomes lately. i would have preferred two, or even three, volumes of a size that could be read comfortably in a chair or in bed. unless i buy an actual lectern, i have nowhere in my house to put this book where i can read it casually or easily. <p> as most reviewers do, i love the new yorker cartoons. i 'm glad to have the collection, but i wish i could enjoy it more easily. <p> The book is outstanding( hence one star) but the New Yorker is engaging in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cartoons ever published. In actual fact the CDs are of such low resolution that MANY of the cartoons can not be interpreted because the caption or even the entire drawing is illegible. If a drawing is too illegible to interpret it is the same as not being included. I love the cartoons of the New Yorker and it was incredibly frustrating browsing the CDs and repeatedly finding cartoons that simply can not be read. Enlarging them does n't help. You WILL get a headache. The publisher should retract their claim and remove the illegible cartoons from the CDs. And shame on them for foisting this on those of us
