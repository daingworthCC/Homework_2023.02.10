It seems all they spend their time doing when elected is campaigning, we the people have no more money to donate. <p> November 13, 2012 12:41 pm at 12:41 pm <p> Sniffit <p> " And the fight for the 2014 Senate may end up being the most compelling storyline as the dawn of the midterm campaign approaches. " <p> CNN wants you to incorrectly believe that the fight for the 2014 Senate is the most compelling storyline, so they do n't have to do any investigative journalism and can distract from the facts and numbers about the real issues while weaving their false equivalence narratives. <p> FIFY <p> November 13, 2012 12:41 pm at 12:41 pm <p> Sniffit <p> Filibuster.

Like four year olds. But four year olds eventually grow up, learn to play nice with others, share, and eventually take responsibility for their actions. I have zero faith that congress will even reach the mentality of a four year old, they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their expense, why should we pay them a salary to give them time to lobby for their job. No corporation would do that, so why are we so stupid as to allow it. Congress pay should be a pay for performance, you do n't perform you do n't get paid. Period, I wish we could recall them all. <p> November 13, 2012 01:30 pm at 1:30 pm <p> just sayin <p> 3.5 years after the recession ended and still no jobs and a shrinking work force and massively growing food stamp line. how is obama and the democrats going to support their massive welfare state with fewer and fewer working taxpayers funding the government? oh yeah, the evil rich people will pay for everything. problem is taking all of their money wo n't come close to funding their massive welfare society. <p> November 13, 2012 01:35 pm at 1:35 pm <p> julie <p> @just sayin -- suck it up or take a hike............... if you 're not part of the solution then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 01:40 pm at 1:40 pm <p> Travis <p> @ Rudy NYC " " Our number goal is to insure that Barack Obama is a one term president.
