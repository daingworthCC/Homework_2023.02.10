5075541 <h> Our View : Minnesotans need to plan for their long-term care <p> The Post-Bulletin editorial board interviewed 29 candidates for the Minnesota Legislature in August and September, and we asked every one of them a question about what the state needs to do to prepare for " the silver tsunami. " Minnesota 's population of senior citizens is about to skyrocket, and we were eager to hear candidates ' ideas on how the state can help make sure its oldest citizens receive the care and assistance they need to live out their lives in dignity and comfort. <p> Frankly, we did n't get many good answers. Everyone agreed that this is a big problem, a potentially budget-busting financial iceberg that 's been drifting toward us for years, but ideas for solutions were scarce indeed. <p> As it turns out, we might have been asking the impossible -- or at least we were looking for solutions in the wrong place. <p> In early October, Gov. Mark Dayton and Lt. Gov. Yvonne Prettner Solon mailed a letter to 1 million Minnesotans between the ages of 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, it was an invitation to visit the state 's new " Own Your Future " website, mn.gov/ownyourfuture. <p> The purpose of the website is simple : To get people to start thinking about how they 'll pay for long-term care in their later years, whether they end up needing some assistance with cleaning, shopping and meal preparation, or require full-time care in a nursing home. <p> What 's at stake? Solon visited Rochester last week, and she bluntly told us if people do n't take ownership of their futures, we 'll soon reach the point where the state and federal governments simply wo n't be able bail them out. <p> " The state 's resources are drying up, " Solon said. " We are simply not going to be able to provide for people as well as could be done if people would plan for themselves. People who are very poor are eligible for Medicaid, and people who are wealthy can reach into their own pockets, but most of us will be in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this care out-of-pocket, so we need to start planning at an early age. " <p> The numbers are startling. During the next two decades, Minnesota 's 65-and-older population is expected to grow by 107 percent, while the rest of our population will grow by just 6 percent. And for those people who see their 65th birthday, 70 percent eventually will require some type of long-term care. Because the average size of a family is continuing to shrink, far fewer of us will receive that care from our children. <p> Once Minnesotans start using the website and are more aware of the need to take action, the next two steps for the state -- which will likely be more challenging -- are : <p> Development of more affordable long-term care products for use by individuals who do not qualify for public programs but are not wealthy enough to self-fund their long-term care. <p> Evaluation of possible changes to Medicaid to better align with and encourage private payment for long-term care. <p> The goal, according to Solon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care insurance. Other states such as Texas and California have done that -- and for some people, such policies are a good option -- but Minnesota is taking a more generalized approach, hoping to give people multiple options that offer peace of mind and security at a reasonable price. <p> Even if you 're not in that target audience of 40-65, we urge you to check out the " Own Your Future " website and to have serious family conversations about long-term care. We owe it to ourselves, our children and our fellow citizens to do our homework and be financially responsible, because as Solon put it, " One way or another, the cost of long-term care is going to come out of our pockets, whether directly or in the form of taxes.
