DO you think it 's very different from the person next to you? n <p> I do n't think the model for engaging clients is clear. nIn fact, the way we engage clients in the process of design it 's much messier than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand our skills and interpret what we deliver. nThe story we tell clients tends to focus much more on process and deliverables. nRather than why what we do matters to the client, and will make a difference to their customers. n <p> There 's an imbalance that needs to be addressed here. n Lets be clear on what mean by engaging clients. I do n't mean contractually. n I mean them actually being involved in the process of design, not just signing off at the end. n Now is a good time to pause, take a breath and ask ourselves honestly, how meaningfully are we engaging clients in the process of design? What are we doing well, where can we improve. n As with all good UX, I think it starts with empathy. nn n nn <p> Most clients have a horror story of working with a designer. Typically to do with attitude, communication and understanding of goals. nClients come to us to us looking for someone that they can work with. What they often get is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just want someone who they can work with to get the job done without any headaches. nWe could blame communication, but we probably communicate regularly. Perhaps it 's the words we use? nnnnn <p> At it 's worse, we leave clients and designers isolated through poor communication and a loss of control away from designers to the client. n It 's human nature to try and control what we do not understand. n The less the client knows, the more they 'll want to control. n Perhaps you can think of a controlling client on a project? n I 'd suggest that it 's this lack of understanding and perhaps confidence on the clients part, which can cause real relationship issues. n <p> For the last decade, we 've though clients to value flat images of webpages. nI think we undersell massively the value we add by producing home page design as part of pitches. nThe homepage design has become the red herring of digital, being an isolated and less relevant page now. nWe need to change the conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding of why a user will engage with the clients site and brand. nIf the client understands that people use, not look at website, they 'll see that the real value is n't in a homepage design. nThis change is happening, but there 's still some way to go. nn <p> So, in the face of these issues, perhaps you 're thinking of joining the increasing number of designers abandoning client work altogether to build their own apps? nI was lucky enough to have the opportunity as part of Analog Cooperative to work on our own ideas, without a client. nIt was different, but not how you 'd expect. nWorking in a start up, the focus is on delivery, not deliverables. nThe things you do for yourself are different to those you do to show value to a client. nnSurprisingly, even in a start-up, you need a product owner. nThey almost take the role of the client. Regardless of whether you 're a freelancer, in-house UX designer, or in an agency or start-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 'm back consulting, I find it useful to see the client as the product owner/designer relationship, rather than the client/supplier. nn <p> I see it is like a holy trinity, made up of users, designers and product owners. All working togethers a shared vision. nnThis model helps me much more than any other I 've seen. nI 've also seen it work elsewhere. nThere will always be tension in design. nThe push and pull of different perspectives can reveal beautiful designs. nnCertain tension can be bad. Like when we try to differentiate ourselves as designers through our designs, pulling the relationship apart. nI try to remember that we do n't own the designs. We 're not the ones who 'll have to live with it for years after we 've finished on the project. nnnn <p> I was impressed by the launch of the new Virgin Atlantic site, where users coming in via search links or PPC ads will find the carousel set up to feature content related to their search, such as pictures of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms fields of the previous design. nI heard Pat Odey, the Virgin Product Manager for this project talk about this project. He described a product owner / designer relationship, where Pat spent approximately 70% of the project time at the agency, LBi 's offices. This was a partnership. Pat described himself as being extremely engaged in the design process. Chris Ball of LBi describes Pat as one of the team. nnn <p> n <p> Now that we 've started to put ourselves in the shoes of the client, lets take a look at how we must appear to the client. nIt starts when we first meet the client... nToo often, communication is strained from the start because a client fears you will speak to them in terms they do not understand. nNo one wants to appear uninformed. nnn <p> Today, I tell my clients that I 'm a Product Experience Designer. nBut what we do is closely related to many other words. nClients find this confusing.

If they 've not been meaningfully engaged in the IA phase, it 's unfair to expect them to meaningfully sign off on what we deliver, particularly when the relationship between components is not clear. nProviding a unified view of IA is an unresolved issue in our work. nn <p> n <p> n <p> n <p> Here are some steps I take, which I find really engage clients meaningfully in the process of design. nBefore I introduce these techniques, I have to highlight the importance of preparation for any and all techniques where the clients is involved. nSimply, if you do n't set it up right, you 're setting yourself up for a fall. nAlso, not all clients will get involved. You may have to work harder with some. nn <p> Importance of explanation &; preparationnSimply, if you do n't set it up right, you 're setting yourself up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nUnderstand the value, makes it easier. nMake it human. nApply learnings about human behaviournUse techniques that we 're hard wired to understand. nBe Mr. / Miss empatheticnn <p> Last year at UX Bristol I ran a workshop on creating a shared experience vision. nI 'm not going to repeat this, but for those of you who missed it, you can find a complete guide to creating a shared vision that works on UX Magazine. There are also links from my own site, alancolville.org. nJust to say, a vision is : nSimply a sentence or group of works expressing the core of the experience people will have with the site. It 's created collaboratively by the project team, including the client. nExperience Visions work because : n- Bring the project team togethern- Puts the client at easen- Keeps people focused on who 's importantn- Creates a culture of shared ownershipn- Empowers peoplenThey 're surprisingly easy to create and have a lasting effect on the project. nnnnn <p> The act of sketching engages the brain in visual sense-making, which people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Sketching helps you generate concepts quickly, exploring alternatives rapidly and is not costly. nThe looseness of a sketch, compared to a wireframes, for instance removes inhibitions and granting clients permission to challenge ideas. nI 'll be honest, if you 're not collaboratively sketching with the client, your not doing it right. nnRemember, the clients does n't have to put pen to paper to be involved in collaborative sketching. nPeople often ask when do you stop sketching? nFor me, when it stops being about ideas, then it 's time to stop. nnn <p> The objective is to quickly develop with the client a customer or user profile. It only takes 10 - 15 minutes per profile. nThe goal is to create a degree of empathy for the end users of the site, Empathy mapping does this in an engaging way, which is immediate and intuitive. nYou can add colour by asking the client to give the persona a name. nThen ask them to describe, from this persona 's point of view, what the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through feeling. nAgain, the looseness of this sketched person removes inhibitions, allowing clients to imagine, and input easily. n <p> Stories are a power technique for engaging people. nThey 're built on a framework that we know. They have the right cues and tap into our collective psyche. Stories also work incredibly well to engage clients by : nn- Putting a human face on datan- Making complex things simplen- Are memorablen- Motivating, persuading and inspiringn- Connecting and creating emotional impactn- Leave it open for the client to fill in the gaps - Engaging their imaginationn- Bringing consistent narrative across device, channel and models of interactionnnIf any of this sounds complex, it 's not. We tell stories everyday. But it 's the ones that understand the basic formula for a good story, who have control and mastery. nI encourage you to learn the formula of a good story. Apply it to explain, engage, spark ideas, create shared understanding or persuade. The formula can be as simple as this : n1. Charactern2. Ambitionn2. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see people overly complicate this technique. The cynical side of me thinks, it 's just some UXers trying to find a voice and specialism. nFor me, stories have always been at the heart of good UX. nWhat 's a persona, if it 's not the story of a typical user. nNot to talk of scenarios, which are a great tool for threading together an entire story about our design. nnRemember, stories have a basic framework, but they do n't have to be text based. nThey take whatever shape necessary to communicate clearly. This could be a comic strip for example. nnImportantly, one small story can be the start of the whole narrative for the site. This narrative is an essential part of a content strategy for a site. nStories also fill the gaps where personas fail. nI 'd liked to have covered the importance of decision architecture, were there time. nJust to say, if you 've not heard of Stephen Anderson 's Mental Note Cards, which if you 're interested in applying the principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these are great fun and clients love them. nnnn <p> There are things that we 're good at, like visualisation, which can help clients bring to life that which is otherwise unseen. nSeeing how well their product is supporting the needs of the business and of its customers, is just one of these opportunities. nUnsurprisingly, clients struggle to capture and hold this view. nnEnter the Experience Maps, which help : nSee the process of the service through the eye of the customernDescribe the customer experience over timenMark positive and negative points in the experiencenLay the grounds for cross channel analysisnIdentify opportunities for service improvements and service innovationnnWe build the user layer, based on research, then together with the client, you build the business layer. nThe key is to do this collaboratively with the client. nThis engaging their imagination in a technique that they used to thinking about, but probably have n't found a way to visualise. nnnn <p> Remember, we do n't own our designs, just as an architect does n't own the building. nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site, day in day out for years to come. nThis helps me view the relationship as a partnership. n <p> A good client / designer relationship is one that has an inevitable outcome. nOne where the client has been involved, knows what 's coming and the outcome seems inevitable. nInevitability is a much undervalued term in design. It comes from having a shared vision of the future. nOne where both of you can see the steps to take you towards or away from the vision. nIt can feel far better than the big tad-dah, which can go wrong. n <p> See any of these information devices and intend putting them in front of a client, pause and consider how to move beyond these patterns. nThey may seem good at first, but they soon hold us back. nTheir structure calls attention to itself. n'design bling '.
