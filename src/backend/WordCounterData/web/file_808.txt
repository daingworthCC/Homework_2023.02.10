" Greek : " agonizing. " The word denotes the intense desire which he had for their salvation ; his fervent, earnest pleading for their welfare. <p> That ye may stand perfect and complete - Margin, as in Greek, filled. The desire was, that they might maintain their Christian principles unadulterated by the mixture of philosophy and error, and completely perform the will of God in every respect. This is the expression of a pious wish in regard to them, without any affirmation that any had been absolutely perfect, or that they would be perfect in this world. It is, however, a command of God that we should be perfect( see Matthew 5:48), and it is the highest wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete in moral character, and may do all the will of God ; compare the notes at 1 Corinthians 13:9??????????????????. That ye may stand firm, perfectly instructed, and fully persuaded of the truth of those doctrines which have been taught you as the revealed will of God : this I believe to be the apostle. <p> Instead of????????????, complete or filled up, almost all the MSS. of the Alexandrian rescension, which, have??????????????? that ye may be fully persuaded. The word?????????? signifies such a complete persuasion of the certainty of a thing, as leaves the mind which room nor inclination to doubt ; and??????????, the verb, has the same meaning, viz., @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by demonstrative argumentation and exhibition of unquestionable facts. <p> This is such a persuasion as the Spirit of God, by means of the Gospel, gives to every sincere and faithful man ; and from which arises the solid happiness of the genuine Christian. They who argue against it, prove, at least, that they have not got it. <p> Epaphras, who is one of you,.... A native of Colosse, and one of their faithful ministers ; see Colossians 1:7. <p> A servant of Christ ; not merely in the same sense as every believer is, but as he was a preacher of the Gospel, in which he faithfully served his Lord and master, Christ : <p> saluteth you ; sends his Christian respects to you, for whom he bore a sincere love and hearty affection, as appears by what follows : <p> always labouring fervently for you in prayers ; in all his prayers, which were many and frequent, he never forgot his dear flock at Colosse, of which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to an agony, as the word signifies ; he wrestled with the Lord as Jacob did, nor, as he, would he let him go without a blessing for this church ; he was incessant, importunate, and fervent in prayer for them : and what he prayed in particular for them was, <p> that ye may stand perfect ; in Christ Jesus their head, and in his spotless righteousness ; see Colossians 1:28 and continue believing in him, and looking to him for righteousness and strength, in whom all the fulness, the perfection of grace dwells ; and where the saints only are, and can continue to be perfect : <p> and complete in all the will of God ; or " be filled " in it, have a perfect knowledge of the revealed will of God, both as to doctrine and practice, and be enabled to act according to it. <p> Lit., in every will. Will means the thing willed, as Luke 12:47 ; James 5:30 ; 1 Thessalonians 5:18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall do all my will(?????????), i.e., perform all the things willed by me. Ephesians 2:3, desires, strictly willings. So here the sense is, everything willed by God. The connection is apparently with???????? ye may stand. For a similar construction see John 8:44 ; Romans 5:2 ; 1 Corinthians 15:1 ; 1 Corinthians 16:13. As Meyer observes, this connection gives stand both a modal definition( perfect and fully assured) and a local definition( in all the will). <p> A touching illustration of priestly service, See Scofield Note : " 1Pet 2:9 " as distinguished from ministry of gift. Shut up in prison, no longer able to preach, Epaphras was still, equally with all believers, a priest. No prison could keep him from the throne of grace, Song he gave himself wholly to the priestly work of intercession. <p> labouring fervently-As the Greek, is the same, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1:29 and 2434Col 2:1), literally, " striving as in the agony of a contest. " <p> in prayers-Translate as Greek, " in his prayers. " <p> complete-The oldest manuscripts read, " fully assured. " It is translated, " fully persuaded, " Ro 4:21 ; 14:5. In the expression " perfect, " he refers to what he has already said, Col 1:28 ; 2:2 ; 3:14. " Perfect " implies the attainment of the full maturity of a Christian. Bengel joins " in all the will of God " with " stand. " <p> 4:10-18 Paul had differed with Barnabas, on the account of this Mark, yet he is not only reconciled, but recommends him to the churches ; an example of a truly Christian and forgiving spirit. If men have been guilty of a fault, it must not always be remembered against them. We must forget as well as forgive. The apostle had comfort in the communion of saints and ministers. One is his fellow-servant, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out their own salvation, and endeavouring to promote the salvation of others. The effectual, fervent prayer is the prevailing prayer, and availeth much. The smiles, flatteries, or frowns of the world, the spirit of error, or the working of self-love, leads many to a way of preaching and living which comes far short of fulfilling their ministry. But those who preach the same doctrine as Paul, and follow his example, may expect the Divine favour and blessing. <p> Luke 1:1 Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, Romans 15:30 I urge you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me. Colossians 1:7 You learned it from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf, Colossians 1:28 We proclaim him, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor, struggling with all his energy, which so powerfully works in me. Colossians 2:1 I want you to know how much I am struggling for you and for those at Laodicea, and for all who have not met me personally. Colossians 4:9 He is coming with Onesimus, our faithful and dear brother, who is one of you. They will tell you everything that is happening here. Philemon 1:23 Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings. James 1:4 Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything. <p> Alphabetical : a all always and assured bondslave Christ earnestly Epaphras firm for fully God greetings He his in is Jesus laboring mature may number of one perfect prayer
