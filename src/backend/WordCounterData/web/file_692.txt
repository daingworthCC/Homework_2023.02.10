If you 're hungry for some crunchy green vegetables, you can head over to the produce aisle and stalk some wild celery. Or if pizza sounds good, you can hide out in the frozen food aisle until just the right moment to snatch that frozen pizza from the freezer! <p> In many places around the world -- and for wild animals -- finding food to sustain life is not nearly as easy as a trip to the supermarket. In the wild, it often comes down to a simple question : are you predator or prey? And the answer is sometimes both! <p> All living things need energy. Energy comes from the foods we eat. A food chain is a simple way of explaining how each living thing gets its food. For example, a simple African food chain might consist of three parts :( 1) trees and bushes ;( 2) giraffes ; and( 3) lions. Giraffes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giraffes. <p> Each link in a food chain is food for the next link. Food chains always start with plants and end with animals. <p> Plants are at the bottom of the food chain. Scientists call them producers, because they use light energy from the sun to produce food from carbon dioxide and water through photosynthesis. <p> Animals, unlike plants, ca n't produce their own food. Instead, they must eat plants or other animals. This is why scientists call them consumers. <p> Consumer animals fall into three categories. Herbivores eat only plants. Carnivores eat only other animals. Omnivores eat both plants and animals. What kind of consumer are you? <p> In addition to producers and consumers, there are also decomposers. These organisms, such as bacteria and fungi, feed on decaying matter. They help the food chain by speeding up the decaying process that releases minerals back into the soil to be absorbed by plants as nutrients. <p> Most food chains have only four or five links in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of energy at each level decreases, because some of the energy is lost in the form of waste or is used up by the organism at that level. That is why it takes many plants, for example, to feed a few giraffes who in turn feed one lion. <p> Most animals are part of many different food chains, because they must eat more than one type of food to satisfy their energy needs. All of these interconnected food chains form a more complex structure called a food web. <p> Humans, for example, are at the center of a very complex food web, because we tend to eat many different types of plants and animals. And unlike what you may have read in fairy tales, there are n't many animals that look at humans as food. <p> The only creatures who might snack on a human are large predators, such as sharks. However, it 's very rare for humans to be eaten by predators. Most predators have more to fear from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Try it out! <p> Ready to put what you learned into action? Grab a friend or family member and head online to play The Food Chain Game! If you correctly assemble the food chain, it will come to life and you can watch it in action! <p> You can also visit National Geographic Explorer! to watch an animated movie about food chains and then take a quiz to see how much you learned. If you 're curious about where a particular animal falls in the food chain, visit What Eats? online and type the name of an animal in the search box to see where it falls in the food chain! <p> Wonder words to know and use : <p> predator <p> prey <p> aisle <p> grocery <p> supermarket <p> produce <p> sustain <p> producer <p> consumer <p> decomposer <p> herbivore <p> carnivore <p> omnivore <p> decaying <p> nutrients <p> interconnected <p> complex <p> structure <p> Still Wondering? <p> In National Geographic Xpeditions ' The Antarctic Food Chain lesson, children are introduced to the animals of Antarctica and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I thought that the lions do n't eat the giraffe because of the legs?

Sep, 2012 at 8:56 pm <p> Great job WONDERing about the food chain Wonder, Carlos!! We bet there is a great deal of research available online that will help you Wonder about your giraffe, lions and ostrich questions!! Keep up the great work, Carlos! <p> Pickle Boy MC <p> 3. Sep, 2012 at 10:34 am <p> I think that today 's wonder was cool. The video was funny too, but I didi n't get the part at the end. I think that tomorrow 's wonder is going to be about practical jokes. <p> Wonderopolis <p> 3. Sep, 2012 at 8:59 pm <p> Thanks for your comment, Pickle Boy! We are glad to hear you liked our video and had a good time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- we will see you very soon!! <p> Stemmet 's class <p> 3.

We ca n't wait for you to Wonder with us tomorrow!! <p> mookie the cat MC <p> 3. Sep, 2012 at 11:24 am <p> Hi! I 'm in Mrs. Caplin 's class. The video was really cool to watch! I think that tomorrow 's wonder will be about magic tricks or April Fools Tricks. <p> Wonderopolis <p> 3. Sep, 2012 at 9:19 pm <p> SUPER guessing, Mookie the Cat! Thanks for joining us today as we Wondered about the food chain -- we are glad you liked watching the video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't wait to see you tomorrow! <p> Emily <p> 3. Sep, 2012 at 12:51 pm <p> Wow. I did n't know that humans were the center of a food chain either. I think tomorrow 's WONDER will be about pulling pranks. Just like Fred and George Weasley from Harry Potter. <p> Emily <p> Wonderopolis <p> 3. Sep, 2012 at 9:02 pm <p> We love that you learned something new with us, Emily!! We think you 've been doing a great job WONDERing on your own -- and we ca n't wait to uncover tomorrow 's Wonder -- it will make you smile! Just like those Weasley twins!! <p> JOLEEN <p> 3. Sep, 2012 at 1:36 pm <p> I think tomorrow 's wonder will be about optical illusions. The wonder of the dayr was great i did n't know that we where 19th in the middle I thought that we where like the 3rd or something like that. <p> Wonderopolis <p> 3. Sep, 2012 at 9:06 pm <p> YIPPEEE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us, Joleen!! You have learned something new and that makes us smile from ear to ear! Thanks for sharing your AWESOME Wonder guess with us tomorrow -- we ca n't wait to begin another adventure together! <p> ayush7( MC) <p> 3. Sep, 2012 at 3:53 pm <p> I think today 's video was funny. I thought a carnivore would be in the center of the food chain but I was wrong so I learned something new from this wonder today. <p> Wonderopolis <p> 3. Sep, 2012 at 9:07 pm <p> CONGRATS, Ayush7, we both learned something new together! Today 's Wonder really taught us a lot, and we are so glad you enjoyed WONDERing with us about the food chain! We 're sending you a virtual high five!! <p> Anna <p> 3. Sep, 2012 at 4:22 pm <p> Haha that video was quite funny! I really liked the wonder of the dayr today wonderopolis! Even though humans are at the top of the food chain, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own the world when we only really own about 1/8 because the earth 3/4 covered, that leaves 1/4, then there are animals so half that = 1/8 Some people need to realize that the earth does n't revolve around them! IT REVOLVES AROUND THE SUN!!! But I guess that just my opinion! I think tomorrow 's wonder will be about MAGIC OR MAGICIANS!! See you tomorrow! Anna. <p> Wonderopolis <p> 3. Sep, 2012 at 9:10 pm <p> Hey there, Anna, thanks for sharing your thoughts with all of us at Wonderopolis! You have done some WONDERful research on your own about the food chain and the earth -- way to go!! We really value your comments and are so happy that today 's Wonder sparked your interest in learning more about the relationships between humans and food! <p> Thanks for guessing and WONDERing with us, Anna! See you soon! <p> Maya <p> 3. Sep, 2012 at 5:44 pm <p> I wonder how many food chains there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all together into one chain. <p> Wonderopolis <p> 3. Sep, 2012 at 9:29 pm <p> Great WONDERing, Maya! We are so happy that you 've been doing some research of your own about our food chain Wonder! Although it may sound like an actual chain, the idea of a food chain provides a visual for us in order to understand it! <p> Keep up the great WONDERing and thinking on a global level! We are so proud of you! <p> Jamez MC <p> 3. Sep, 2012 at 6:43 pm <p> I LOVED today 's video. I 'm pretty sure the food chain in the video is sun, plant, mouse, bird, alligator, human. I think tomorrow 's wonder will be about jokes or someone who tells jokes. <p> Wonderopolis <p> 3. Sep, 2012 at 9:56 pm <p> You 've made some great observations, Jamez!! You did a WONDERful job pointing out the different links in the food chain video! NICE WORK! We ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chains and food webs are a huge part of 5th grade science so I am excited to see so many MC students reading about the chain. It is neat that some are learning new facts, others are making predictions for tomorrow 's wonder and even if you 're a little confused that is ok also. That is how we all learn. Ca n't wait to check in with all the MC students tomorrow at school. <p> Wonderopolis <p> 3. Sep, 2012 at 9:21 pm <p> How right you are, Mrs. Caplin -- thanks for sharing your WONDERful comment today! There is so much to learn, and we all learn in different ways. We are so happy when our Wonder Friends ask questions, think outside the box and have a great time using their imaginations! We are so happy to have all of these WONDERful Friends here! <p> Siddman MC <p> 3. Sep, 2012 at 7:32 pm <p> I 'm with with Ayush on this one. The video WAS hilarious!!!! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food chain. I think tomorrow 's wonder of the day will be about jokes. <p> Julianab123( MC) <p> 3.
