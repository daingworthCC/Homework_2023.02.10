If you 're still debating between the iPad 1 and the iPad 2 check out my review of the first generation iPad right here on Amazon to see a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) over the past 11 months. <p> Let me begin by saying this upfront, I do n't work for Apple, I do n't own Apple Stock, and whether you buy an iPad, Xoom, a laptop or a pad of paper and pencil I do n't get anything for writing this. I 'm not an Apple " fanboy " although I can give credit where credit is due and lately Apple has deserved a lot of credit for some of their products. <p> Physical Characteristics The iPad 2 is absurdly thin. More importantly than it 's thinness is its tapered edge which feels more natural in your hand. One of the biggest complaints about the original iPad was it really was n't tremendously comfortable to hold for long periods at a time. For a tablet device designed to be held, that 's a pretty big deal. Apple really has done an amazing job of cramming everything into an even smaller space than before and the difference is really noticeable when you 're holding the device. In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall weight of the iPad 2. That might not seem like a huge deal to most, especially when you consider the weight difference is n't tremendous when you 're already under 2 pounds, but I spend a good part of my day holding the iPad in my hands and the weight difference is surprising by the end of the day. The first generation is n't heavy by any means, but the iPad 2 outshines it. <p> New and " Improved " Apple doubled the RAM in the iPad 2 from 256MB to 512MB. What does that mean? For most casual users, probably not a whole lot. There is a performance bump that everyone will see the effects of in things like loading times for webpages that are open in the background, but 256MB was sufficient for most daily use and games. If you 're planning to use your device for some of the more graphically intense games the iPad 2 does offer a better method of graphics processing that 'll help deliver faster images with fewer jerky movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e-mail you 're not going to know the difference. <p> The screen is the same for all real purposes. It is technically a " new " part in that it is n't identical to the old, it 's a bit thinner and more efficient, but it 's the same resolution. The Glass is thinner though, and this amounts to a fair bit of the weight loss from one generation to the next. In playing with the device it seems surprising but despite feeling lighter it actually feels more sturdy in your hands. I still would n't suggest dropping it, but if it were to fall the iPad 2 certainly feels like it might stand a better chance to survive. Try not to drop it though. <p> The addition of 2 cameras was expected. Some were a bit surprised to see the first generation released without the cameras. Whether it was for a price point consideration, or a means to get people to upgrade, Apple held off until iPad 2. The cameras do a reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicated digital camera, or really even the camera on your phone for most still images. The cameras do a substantially better job with video, and FaceTime is probably one of the best reasons to get the iPad 2 over the original iPad. For those who might not be familiar, FaceTime is Apple 's face to face conferencing system, kind of like Skype, or if you 'd rather, kind of like the Jetson 's TV/Phone. With the push of a button you can be having a face to face chat with a loved one just about anywhere in the world( provided they 're on a wireless network at the time). FaceTime does n't work over 3G natively( it can be used over a wifi connection created by a 3G device however) so you 're not going to be able to use it in your car anytime soon. This is probably a good thing though. It is incredibly easy to use and if you know other people with an iPad 2, iPhone 4, or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Covers are n't really " smart " but they 're really very useful. Not only do they provide a stylistic enhancement of the device, but they serve a practical and functional purpose of doubling as a screen protector and stand in 2 configurations. You can find them in a variety of colors and from third market suppliers, and it 's a safe bet that more will be out soon to capitalize on the magnetic sensors in the iPad 2. It 's unfortunate that this same feature ca n't somehow be retrofitted to the iPad 1, I would n't have thought a case would be a compelling reason to consider a product over it 's competitor, but these covers are really so useful it 's hard to understand why they 've not been there since the beginning. <p> Multitasking Support One of the biggest knocks against the iPad when first released was the lack of native multi-tasking support. Jailbreakers added the feature quickly and Apple soon realized it would be a requirement for any future device 's success and released an OS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that progress and takes it a step further with the increased RAM enabling more open applications to be suspended at once, and the time to open or close an application has improved as well. That said, even the first generation managed to open and close apps faster than most people would be used to on their computers, so while this is an improvement it 's more akin to showing off. <p> Apps One thing that Apple has clearly the advantage in for the moment is app availability. The App store has close to 70,000 iPad specific Apps, all of which will work on the iPad 2. The new cameras will undoubtedly see this list expand rapidly, as will the inclusion of a gyroscope for gaming and motion based uses. There are also a substantial number of professional applications ranging from document creation to photo editing and vector drawing. Chances are if you can dream it, there 's an App for that( and if not you might want to get started on one to fill in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing, and ultimately it 'll likely be a strong competitor, for now it still has a ways to go, but any potential buyer should consider the strength of the application market before buying a tablet. <p> Pros : Weight. Seriously. The minimal weight of this thing is by far the most impressive feature about it in my opinion. It seems to defy physics and logic that so much could be in such a small space working that hard for that long. <p> Battery Life. From full to dead my iPad 2 went just over 11 hours with the movie Robin Hood showing twice during that time, the screen at half brightness, wifi turned on, an Angry Birds marathon and a good portion of a book in ibook. That 's better than a work day and that 's constantly on. <p> Books. This is definitely a Pro, but reading itself could go either way. The great benefit to the iPad is having access to Google Books, ibook, Nook, and Kindle. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although for the most part they 're all usually about the same). Reading in the evenings in bed is great as the back light means you do n't have to worry about keeping others awake, but the glass screen causes some glare trouble when trying to read outside or near a sunny window. If you 're an avid outdoor reader the Kindle might still be your best bet. <p> Cons : Still no dedicated USB support. While there is a camera add-on that allows for certain USB devices to be used there is no option for mass storage. Some of the Android Tablets allow for this and if you find yourself wanting to use your tablet as a standalone storage device this might be something to consider. The device can read from certain flash drives though, but is largely limited to photo and video files. Jailbreaks offer solutions to this, but those come with their own issues as well. <p> Still no dedicated SD card slot. This is troublesome on two fronts. First, if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an adapter which is just one more thing to carry around. Second, the lack of expansion means you 're limited to what you purchase in terms of storage. I purchased a 32GB iPad last time and never filled it up completely, so for me capacity was n't an issue. If you want to be able to have your entire movie collection with you though... you may want to consider whether the iPad 2 can meet your space requirements. <p> HDMI output. Really this is a Pro and a Con. The iPad does allow for HD output over HDMI but again it requires an adapter. All of these adapters are additional purchases for features that some tablets offer built in. This can be a pain, but then again if you 're not likely to ever use HDMI Output then you 're not paying for something you wo n't use. <p> No Flash Support. This is becoming less and less of an issue as the internet and web developers are moving away from Flash for many websites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Adobe 's Flash to run properly( including a lot of web based games). Before you pick a tablet consider what kind of websites you frequent and try and determine if they are Flash driven or not. If they are you may really want to consider something from the Android offerings as it is expected that they 'll have at least some Flash support. <p> If you 're in the market for a tablet device the iPad 2 should definitely be on your short list. If you 're uncertain it is always best to go and play with these things hands on first if you can. Best Buy is a good place for that, so are Verizon Stores since they have the Xoom and 3G iPad. Do n't get pulled into the hype and mania that comes with an Apple release. Read more <p> People need to be aware that the reviews you see for the iPad often reflect the old Mac/PC platform wars with some people making comments who simply do n't like iPads from a distance, without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the deplorable Apple mania they find so distasteful. They 're entitled to their opinion, of course, but it is unfortunate they skew the evaluation of this product without the deep acquaintance one needs in order to give it an insightful evaluation. <p> I have taught computer science at the college level for 26 years and have had computers with all kinds of operating systems. I do n't own Apple stock and have never known anyone who works at Apple. I therefore have no connection to Apple. <p> I have had my iPad for about a month and read a fair number of reviews before I purchased, spent some time using one at the store, and thought about what I might use one for, in contrast to my laptop with which I am well satisfied. People too often think of computers in terms of hardware, the specs and looks, instead of the software and the functionality. You should ask yourself, " What will I use this for that solves a problem I would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardware, even though it is the hardware that makes an impression. <p> The iPad is not a laptop and is not principally a production computer, that is, a computer on which you are going to develop web pages, do serious graphics editing, or write a book. You could use your new Taurus to tow a trailer, but that is not what it is designed to do well. These things can increasingly be done on an iPad, but I do n't believe they will ever be what it is best at. It is a portable media machine with an inviting touch interface that requires a somewhat different set of skills, which take a modest amount of time to learn. Surfing the web, checking email, watching movies, playing games, looking at new cars, reading the Economist magazine, all work better on an iPad than a laptop. It does these things very well indeed. There are now 80,000 apps for a wide variety of activities--given its design intent. The apps are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bunch from the " app store " for little investment. As with Amazon, you can see what other people think of an app before getting one. <p> This would be a splendid acquisition for small children, for teens deep into social networking, for an adult wanting to drop into the love seat for a quick look at what is happening in the world, for a senior citizen who wants a simple, inviting system with few hassles, to stay in touch with grandchildren. The iPad is not a light laptop ; it is instead a different way to use computing to do a wide variety of consumption and communication--not principally production. <p> In my experience, its wi-fi is adroit from one environment to another. It " knows " where it is geographically, scans its environment for wi-fi, and accesses wi-fi seamlessly. At this point in time, we should expect no less. I can not address the 3G communications since I have a wi-fi only( I am not convinced of the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotspot). I have never had it crash, though I have had to back myself out of apps that seemed to have no logical next step. This was the result either of my ignorance or the fact that there is less of a standard user interface from app to app than there is in classical GUIs such as OS X and Windows. <p> For the laptop lugging road-warrior, it should be noted, this is not going to be a full replacement. I now take my laptop and my iPad when I go into the college. But much of the time there, I use my iPad because it is so light, convenient and useable. I use it to teach my classes and often reference traditional texts from the iPad instead of lugging them along to class. I develop my own web pages on my 27 " desktop which is the right environment for such development ; I would n't expect to do that on an iPad. In education( and evidently in medicine), it is proving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portable information access and transmission are critical will find this a compelling solution. The heavy Photoshop user or music track editor will still need a conventional computer, either laptop or desktop. <p> I purchased the 64GB version, which may be more storage than I need. But since it will drive my 50 " screen downstairs I figured I would begin to load lots of pictures and favored music, so it may prove a wise choice in the long run. It can swallow up entire evenings with the music-augmented slide shows it can do. In fact, you may begin to wonder if you need cable TV. Conventional content providers should be worried about the iPad since it provides yet another way for the user to determine viewing experience. But if you are still drawn to cable, it makes a fine remote control. <p> Before people evaluate this new kind of computing, they need to spend a month or so with it to identify what it does well and what would be better left to other kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( both glowing and critical) are not well informed and so do not serve the readers well. So read these reviews with a critical eye. <p> October 18 2011 Update : <p> I continue to find my iPad remarkably productive and productive in ways I would not have anticipated. It does indeed redefine how we can use computing so that it does the work we want to do with minimal impediments. I now leave my laptop at school and take my iPad back and forth since 80 or 90% of the time the iPad does all I need to do. I use it 3 or 4 hours a day. <p> I just ordered my wife an 11 " MacBook Air with the larger RAM and storage, which might seem to contradict what I said in my review. I do n't believe it does for the following reasons. She needs to do serious editing of Word documents for the volunteer work she does for the college and still wants the joys of a 2-pound piece of elegant hardware. She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's keyboard. A keyboard can be added to an iPad, but it 's a kludgy add-on that compromises the point of the iPad : an ultra-light slim, touch-interface device that does most of what traditional computing does without the impediments of mouse and keyboard and weight. The 11 " Air is a gem of engineering with many of the advantages of the iPad but it is more capable of the production I spoke of in my review since it is a full OS X Lion machine--so it is fully capable of running traditional production software such as Word or Photoshop or, for that matter, Windows. <p> The Air and the iPad illustrate the difference between a consumption device( iPad) and a production device( Air). Much of what is appealing in the iPad can be had in the Air, but at the cost of an additional several hundred dollars. It 's not the solution I want since I do n't want the keyboard getting in the way when I want to curl up with a consumption device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my teaching in class. My wife prefers the Air since email and other typing-intensive production activities are so important to her. In a word, the iPad is distilled essence of computationally assisted consumption. <p> SUMMARY : White iPad 2 64GB Wifi-only A really wonderful electronic device for media consumption with some moderate content creation potential. This will likely change as more apps focused on content generation are created. I find myself using it more and more simply because it is " always ready " and small enough that it is always near. If this device had a better file management system and a more robust way to share printers it would have gotten 5 out of 5 stars. As it is, the iPad 2 is a solid 4 star device. <p> DELIGHTERS( Current features that exceeded my expectations) FORM FACTOR : Thin and comfortable to hold. Small enough to toss in a bag or carry around the house so you find yourself using rather than trying to " remember " to do " that thing " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some weight to it( 1.3lb) so prolonged reading in certain positions will cause fatigue. APP ENVIRONMENT : Really excellent variety and quality of applications for a broad range of uses and a broad range of prices. Also plays nice with content providers like amazon kindle, Google docs, and lots of news outlets. SLEEP MODE : It is seemingly " always ready " as it wakes from sleep very quickly. HDMI OUT : Granted there is a $40 accessory required it is nice to have the option of showing what 's on your iPad 2 to a larger audience. iOS : Overall the operating system is " cleanly " designed, features are easy to navigate and find. PROCESSING SPEED : Remarkably quick to load apps, web pages, pdfs, etc. <p> SATISFIERS( Current features that met my expectation) HOMESHARING : Being able to share my iTunes library( music, movies, podcast, etc) across my wifi network is wonderful and saves space on the iPad 2. SCREEN : Bright, good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handles pictures and text with aplomb. PRICE : Reasonable considering the competition but nearly high enough to justify a " real " laptop AUDIO : Speaker is quite good for a handheld device, placement in portrait mode ends up in your lap but you can invert the iPad so not a huge deal. Also speaker faces rear of device instead of forward meaning you need to crank it louder than maybe otherwise necessary if it were forward facing. BATTERY LIFE : Battery holds up well even after a day of heavy usage, charges up easily over night. Can go 2-3 days without charging with moderate to light usage) WIFI : This simply " works ". turn it on, detect a signal, and go. No messing around with complicated network settings. ONSCREEN KEYBOARD : Its responsive and surprisingly easy to use. However, scrolling to a separate numbers keyboard and lack of a " tab " button really disrupts workflow. <p> DISSATISFIERS( Current features that did not meet my expectations) FILE MANAGEMENT : File management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " attach " files to apps or email them? PRINTING : Unless you have an AirPrint capable printer( new hardware to buy) or one of a handful other printers you will need to use the atrocious " file management " system above to get the docs on you computer to print. Double whammy of pain! CAMERAS : The two cameras are adequate for video chatting but taking stills is a joke. True I would n't want to shoot a lot of birthdays holding an iPad but I would like to use a program like " GeniusScan " to photograph documents for later reference. The 0.7Megapixel camera is capable of " barely legible " documents. COST PER GB : Paying &gt;$3 per GB( $100 more for 64GB than 32GB) is nearly twice what you 'd pay per GB for the difference in a stand-alone USB thumbdrive. TOUCH NAVIGATION : Ok so this is a general criticism of any touch device and there is no way to get around it really. Having " grown up " using keyboards and mice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do tasks differently. Press-Hold, Swipe, Two vs Three fingers. All for tasks I was so used to doing with a Tab or Right-click. <p> WISHLIST( features I 'd like to see in the next-gen iPad) Touchscreen : The capacitive screen works fine for many things but writing notes with a " fat " stylus is n't one of them. Having a touch screen that does n't require the " fat " stylus would greatly improve handwriting and note taking. USB or SD Card ports( never gon na happen as Apple uses memory as a price differentiator but it does n't hurt to dream) Retina display Infrared receiver/transmitter( Can anyone say universal remote!) GPS Cheaper 3G antenna : $130 bucks extra for a 3G receiver plus I got ta buy a plan? ugh. Smartcover : Would like to
