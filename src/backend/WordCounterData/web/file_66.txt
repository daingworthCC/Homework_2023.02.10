5033141 <p> Ahh, I see now. Well hey, it 's unique, I definately ca n't knock it. And wow! 25 cats? When I was in college I spent a couple summers at my dad 's place, which at the time was a single-wide 70 's style mobile home with 5 adults( including myself), 3 kids under age 12, 12 cats and 2 rats( pets). I thought that was crowded, haha, but 25 cats?? Hehe, no offense, but are you the " wierd cat lady " in your neighborhood? <p> Not gon na necro a 7 month old thread, but when I post I try to be as proper with my written english as I can( imperfect at times, I know). In my opinion, good sentence structure and spelling is one of the easiest ways to make people think you 're intelligent, at least at first glance. Occasionally I 'll purposely misspell/make up words to add a bit of personality to my posts. <p> Ahh, I see now. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't knock it. And wow! 25 cats?
