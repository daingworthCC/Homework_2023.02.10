When We Were Colored supplies these small-scale heroes, but unfortunately, the movie is intermediate, too. It 's based on a small-press book by the Oklahoma author that ended up lauded in the New York Times. Director Tim Reid, of WKRP in Cincinnati fame, has created a film deeply corny in spots, with intrusive narration by screenwriter Paul W. Cooper. <p> The village of Glen Allan, Miss., seen from the end of WWII into the years of the civil-rights movement, is a sort of African American Walton 's Mountain, complete with the pencil eraser-chewing penses that Richard Thomas used to utter when summing up what we 'd all just seen perfectly clearly. <p> Cliff( Willie Norwood Jr.) is raised by his great-grandfather( Al Freeman Jr.) and an extended family of friends and relations.

Naturally, he 's shipped off back to the Detroit halfway through, and the movie halts as if it had been shot with a tranquilizer dart. <p> Once Upon a Time... is the traditional prelude for fairy tales, but fairy tales ought to have more menace, meanings that we do n't easily grasp, levels within levels. This film has a noble purpose, to show a time when people looked out for one another, but movies that simplify the experiences of the past just make the past seem all the more unreachable. <p> Once Upon a Time...
