5032441 <h> Bowles ready to step into spotlight <p> PHILADELPHIA? Todd Bowles agreed to become the Eagles? interim defensive coordinator during an early Tuesday morning breakfast. <p> There was no hint of what was to come until Bowles hit the dining area. <p>? I just got off the treadmill and went in the cafeteria,? Bowles said.? It? s my morning ritual. I get here about 5:30 and I? ll work out with Coach( Duce) Staley and Coach( Mike) Caldwell. Then I? ll go get something to eat. He called me up( to his office) and that? s when I found out.? <p> For Bowles, it was less dramatic than taking over as interim head coach of the Dolphins when they canned Tony Sparano last season. <p>? He said he? s going to go with his gut and he felt it was the right thing to do,? Bowles said of Reid.? I sat in his seat for three games last year and being a head coach is not easy. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and hope they become popular. It? s no different than everybody else that has to make decisions when you? re in that seat. You? ve got to make that call. That was a call he made, and I don? t think he had any help from anybody. It? s just something that he told me.? <p> Bowles, 48, has been around the block. Undrafted out of Temple in 1986, he intercepted 16 passes in nine NFL seasons, including eight with the Washington Redskins. Bowles started at safety for the Redskins? Super Bowl XXII championship team. In Washington he was influenced by Richie Petitbon, one of the top NFL assistants of all time. <p> Later Bowles was schooled by Hall of Fame defensive back Emmitt Thomas, the defensive coordinator of the Eagles during the Ray Rhodes era as head coach( 1995-98). Castillo got his start as an NFL coach with the Eagles during the Rhodes regime. <p> Possibly the biggest influence on Bowles was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dallas and followed him to Miami. <p>? Bill kind of taught me to see the whole game and how to see the team as a whole,? Bowles said.? He always wanted me to learn more than my position. The biggest thing he taught me was at the end of a game and a loss, the people who take the loss the hardest are the coaches. The players can forget about it in two or three days, the head coach has to stand in front of you guys and the defensive coaches are ticked because they know what really happened.? <p> Bowles was in the mix as the successor to Sean McDermott, fired as Eagles defensive coordinator after the 2010 season. The Eagles were denied permission to speak with him, among other numerous candidates that offseason. <p>? When I tried to interview him before to be a coordinator here, I had heard great things about him,? Reid said.? Then I had a chance to interview him and now I? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he can do that. I like the way he worked with Juan. He handled that the right way. He didn? t try to come in and cut Juan? s legs out from under him or any of that. He came in and worked with him and they had a good working relationship. I appreciated the way he went about his business and how he handled the other coaches and the players. I think the people that have worked with him surely have had a lot of confidence in him and there are some that have been very close to me and so I put a little trust in that.? <p> It? s early, but Bowles comes off philosophically as a guy who plays sound, aggressive defense with a minimum of risk. <p> Bowles doesn? t seem to be nearly the blitzer McDermott was or as conservative at bringing extra pass rushers as Castillo. <p> Above all, Bowles is going to get after what he feels is an underachieving group of players. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said.? We? re as talented as anybody in the league. But we? ve got to work together and we? ve got to put it together and we? ve got to make sure that each
