5035941 <p> There are a lot of injury issues in the NFC South this week. Let 's take a look at the latest on the most significant injuries : <p> ATLANTA FALCONS <p> The Falcons have a star-studded cast of players listed as questionable for Sunday 's game with Arizona. Receiver Julio Jones, who has not practiced all week due to an ankle injury, highlights the list. If Jones ca n't play Sunday, the Falcons likely would start Harry Douglas and use Drew Davis or recently signed Tim Toone as their third receiver. Linebacker Sean Weatherspoon( ankle) did not practice all week, has missed two straight games and is listed as questionable. In the cases of both Jones and Weatherspoon, I would n't be surprised if the Falcons take a cautious approach and sit them, especially since the game is on turf and against a struggling opponent. The Falcons also are listing defensive end John Abraham( back) and running back Michael Turner( groin) as questionable. But both participated in Friday 's practice on a limited basis. <p> NEW ORLEANS SAINTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertainty if running back Darren Sproles will be able to play Sunday. Interim coach Joe Vitt said Sproles experienced some swelling in his hand and is listed as questionable. Running back is one position where the Saints have plenty of depth and they can continue to use a rotation of Pierre Thomas, Mark Ingram and Chris Ivory if Sproles is n't ready to go. Right tackle Zach Strief( groin) has been ruled out for Sunday. That means it 's likely Charles Brown will start in his place. <p> CAROLINA PANTHERS <p> Despite missing Thursday 's practice receiver/return man Armanti Edwards( groin) is probable for Sunday. Coach Ron Rivera also said Jeff Byers will start at right guard Sunday. There had been speculation that Jeremy Bridges, who was signed earlier this week, might move immediately into the starting lineup. But Rivera said Bridges still needs to work on conditioning. <p> TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS <p> Guard Jamon Meredith( ankle) participated in Friday 's walk-through, giving the Bucs some hope he might be ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thursday 's session due to what coach Greg Schiano said was a personal reason. <p> Friday 's NFC South chat was held outside its normal time frame due to a scheduling conflict. But that did n't seem to matter. We got the same great participation as always. <p> Let 's take a run through some of the team-by-team highlights : <p> ATLANTA FALCONS <p> Kyle( ATL) : What was the tipping with Ray Edwards? Why release him now? Do the 3 guys mentioned as replacements have the talent to produce? <p> Pat Yasinskas : Like I said, I think it was more than just his lack of production. Maybe his attitude was n't the best and maybe there were concerns about that impacting the locker room. Are the other guys ready to produce? Not sure about that. But at least they 'll give maximum effort. <p> James Stephens( Atlanta) : With Turner 's lack of speed burst and his size, do you think Falcons would be better using him as a FB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allowing Quizz to use his quickness to get to the hole and Turners size to catch the a LB or D-Lineman in the backfield. <p> Pat Yasinskas : Not sure about using Turner as FB, but would n't mind seeing Jacquizz get a few more carries. <p> Dylan( Rock Springs, WY) : What can the Falcons do to improve their run game? <p> Pat Yasinskas : Not sure there 's much they can do right now. But it surely will be an offseason priority. <p> CAROLINA PANTHERS <p> Eric( Raleigh, NC) : Pat, Is there any chance Jerry Richardson will go after a big fish who is both coach and GM? He obviously struck out with Ron Rivera going with the guy that has no experience. I am hoping for a proven Head Coach. I would love for it to be Andy Reid. I think in order for Reid to come here he would have to offer the GM role as well. Any chance this could happen? <p> Pat Yasinskas : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no. He made Seifert coach and GM and that was a disaster. After that, Richardson said he 'd never give one person all the power again. But, hey, he could change his mind. <p> Adam Creed( Boone) : I doubt there 's room cap wise, but has there been any thought of Ray Edwards going to the panthers? / Any word on where he might go? <p> Pat Yasinskas : First off, Ray Edwards would n't command a big contract right now. Second, Panthers have about $4.5 in cap room for this year, but are over cap for next year. Lastly, in talking to some people with Panthers, I do n't think they 're real high on Edwards. <p> Donneith( Columbia, SC) : Do you think that the Panthers new GM could possibly look to replace Cam as out QB? <p> Pat Yasinskas : No, too much invested in Cam and he still has lots of upside. Whoever is hired as GM will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> NEW ORLEANS SAINTS <p> John( Mobile)( via mobile) : Pat do you really think Payton is considering leaving for the Dallas job? Do you see the saints going de or db in the draft? <p> Pat Yasinskas : I ca n't read his mind. It 's really up to him. But nothing would surprise me. As far as the draft, I 'd go DE first. <p> Richard( Ann Arbor, MI) : Since Tracy Porter ' s only playing on a 1-yr contract, could the Saints afford him if Denver decides not to resign him? Could use the help in the secondary. <p> Pat Yasinskas : Agree they can use help in secondary. But not sure Porter would be the guy for them. There were reasons why they let him go in the first place. <p> TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS <p> Quez( Muck Bowl, FLA) : Pat, with Freeman re-establishing himself in the top-10 of NFL QBs, do you think we will resign him before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money do you think he could get?? <p> Pat Yasnskas : I think, at this point, they 'll wait until after the season. Best to avoid distractions. But I think an extension will come shortly after the season. As to how much he 'll get, I do n't think it will be Brees/Manning money, but it will be significant because he 's a guy who 's got tons of upside and seems to be a perfect fit in their offensive system. <p> Will Rogers( New Port Richey) : I know Q. Black was n't our best player on defense but he had decent speed. With Adam Heyward replacing him, is it going to affect the way they keep Cam bottled up this week like they did in week one? <p> Pat Yasinskas : Hayward 's not bad at all. Let 's see how he does Sunday. <p> Piece of history : The Falcons have a chance to be a part of history that would be nice for them, but it would put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skelton has thrown an interception in each of his past 12 games. Who was the last quarterback to throw an interception in 13 straight games? Ryan Leaf, according to ESPN Stats &; Information. <p> Numbers game : We 're about to find out if nine really is an unlucky number for the Falcons. Last week, they had a chance to start 9-0, but lost to New Orleans. On Sunday, they 'll have a chance to run their home winning streak to nine consecutive games. That would be the longest streak since the Falcons won 10 straight at home between the 1997 and ' 98 seasons. <p> Who needs Nicks? A lot of people thought Tampa Bay 's offensive line would crumble when All-Pro guard Carl Nicks went out with a season-ending injury. Surprisingly, the loss of Nicks does n't seem to be having a negative impact on rookie running back Doug Martin. In the two games since Nicks went out, Martin has averaged 8.3 yards per carry when running up the middle or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can put some of the blame for this on a battered and struggling offensive line, but Carolina quarterback Cam Newton, who showed a big arm as a rookie last year, has n't had much success throwing downfield this season. Newton has 31 pass attempts of more than 20 yards without a touchdown. That 's the most in the league, by far. Minnesota 's Christian Ponder is next with 16 downfield attempts without a touchdown. <p> Rally cry : The Saints have become just the 10th team since 1966 to start 0-4 and rally to win at least four of their next five games. But their playoff chances remain slim. Of the nine other teams to rally like that after an 0-4 start, only the 1992 San Diego Chargers made it to the playoffs. <p> The Tampa Bay Times has a great story about former Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy that really wo n't come as a surprise. <p> It 's vintage Dungy. <p> Back in February, he bumped into a car in a church parking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The owner of the car did n't see any damage and told Dungy so. But the coach-turned-broadcaster said he still did n't feel right about it and wanted to make amends. <p> The owner of the car is a teacher at Pride Elementary School, which happens to be just a couple miles down the street from NFC South Blog headquarters. She offered a compromise to Dungy and it played out Thursday. <p> Dungy came to Pride and talked to students as part of the Great American Teach-In. Dungy, who moved back to Tampa after he stopped coaching the Indianapolis Colts, always has been active in the community. Education is something that 's important to him because both his parents were teachers. <p> Time for a quick look at the top Friday morning headlines from around the division : <p> ATLANTA FALCONS <p> Kent Somers writes that offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter is likely to be a candidate for a job as a head coach after the season. That might happen, but Koetter can only help his chances at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game to go with Atlanta 's passing game. <p> Speaking of Atlanta 's running game, the Falcons came into the season saying they planned to limit the number of carries for Michael Turner. The running back said he still is adjusting to that role. He better adjust quickly, because the Falcons already are into the second half of their season. <p> D. Orlando Ledbetter writes that defensive ends Lawrence Sidbury, Cliff Matthews and Jonathan Massaquoi all have a chance at increased playing time after the release of Ray Edwards. Matthews is the guy I 'd keep an eye on. He has the most value on special teams, and that means he 's likely to be active on game days and should get a spot in the rotation at defensive end. <p> CAROLINA PANTHERS <p> Ron Green Jr. has a nice story on how linebacker Thomas Davis has made a successful comeback from his third torn ACL. Davis is believed to be the first NFL player to accomplish that, and that alone should make him a candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peyton Manning and Minnesota running back Adrian Peterson probably have a better shot at the award because they have higher profiles. <p> Although the Panthers named Richard Rodgers as their special teams coach after firing Brian Murphy this week, they 're using a committee approach, and other assistants are now involved with the special teams. <p> NEW ORLEANS SAINTS <p> Mike Triplett writes that Sean Payton probably will take his time in getting a new contract done with the Saints. That would give Payton time to see if the Dallas job, which Triplett says is the only job that might lure him away from the Saints, does come open. If you 're a Saints ' fan, it 's time to start rooting for the Cowboys to go on a playoff run so that coach Jason Garrett keeps his job. <p> Deuce McAllister said he 'll be happy to see receiver Marques Colston break his franchise record for touchdowns scored. The two are currently tied with 55 apiece. McAllister said he has always admired how hard Colston has worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature on how fullback Erik Lorig has emerged as an important part of Tampa Bay 's offense. Lorig already has a career-high nine receptions, and has been doing a nice job blocking for Doug Martin. <p> Cornerback Aqib Talib spoke with the Boston-area media for the first time since he was traded from Tampa Bay to New England. Talib would n't talk about his past troubles and said, when he met with Patriots coach Bill Belichick, the focus was only on the present. <p> Now, it 's time to go a little deeper on that. I 've got more detailed results on where the voting stood as of Wednesday night. Let 's run through those results and I 'll tell you which NFC South players are in the top five at their positions. Also, here 's t he link to go vote. <p> I went to check on the ESPN NFL Expert Picks expecting the panel to be unanimous in this week 's games involving NFC South teams. <p> But it turns out that 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its choice of the Atlanta Falcons over the Arizona Cardinals. That makes plenty of sense because the Falcons are very tough at the Georgia Dome and the Cardinals are crumbling after a fast start. <p> But there was a little bit of division among the panelists when it came to the other two NFC South games. <p> Twelve panel members are picking the Tampa Bay Buccaneers over the Carolina Panthers and I 'd make the same prediction. The Bucs suddenly are hot and the Panthers are having a dismal season. But Keyshawn Johnson, who played for both teams, and Adam Schefter picked the Panthers. <p> Schefter also went against conventional wisdom in picking the Oakland Raiders to defeat the New Orleans Saints. He and Chris Mortensen are the only two panelists picking against the Saints. <p> We 've got a bunch of significant injuries around the NFC South, so let 's take a look at the latest news. <p> Carolina Panthers receiver/kick returner Armanti Edwards( groin) sat out Thursday 's practice. That could clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field. Adams began the season as Carolina 's main return man, but lost the job after having problems with fumbles. Captian Munnerlyn has been handling punt returns, but has n't been very productive. If Adams is healthy, the Panthers could put him back in place as their punt returner and either he or David Gettis could return kicks. <p> New Orleans right tackle Zach Strief( groin) missed another day of practice and it appears as if Charles Brown will get another start in his place. On the positive side, running back/return man Darren Sproles participated fully in practice. <p> Tampa Bay 's battered offensive line could be taking another hit. Right guard Jamon Meredith did not practice Thursday due to an ankle injury. The Bucs already have had to shuffle their offensive line several times after losing guards Davin Joseph and Carl Nicks to season-ending injuries. Roger Allen is the only backup guard listed on the team 's depth chart and he recently was elevated from the practice squad. But reserve tackle Jeremy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at guard if Meredith is n't able to play Sunday at Carolina. Also, cornerback Eric Wright missed practice, but coach Greg Schiano said it was for personal reasons. There was a FOX Sports report several weeks ago that Wright will face a suspension for violating the NFL 's policy on performance-enhancing substances. When asked if that situation had something to do with Wright 's absence, Schiano simply said the cornerback will play if he 's healthy Sunday. <p> Atlanta receiver Julio Jones( ankle) missed a second straight day of practice. Backup receiver Kevin Cone also was out. If Jones ca n't play Sunday, the Falcons likely would start Harry Douglas opposite Roddy White and they 'd have to use Drew Davis and recently-signed Nick Toone as their backup receivers. Linebacker Sean Weatherspoon( ankle) also was held out of practice. Coach Mike Smith indicated Wednesday there was a chance Weatherspoon might be cleared to practice Thursday, but it 's starting to look like the Falcons might have to get through another game with Akeem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although he already has been released, defensive end Ray Edwards still will cost the Atlanta Falcons $4.65 million against the 2013 salary cap. <p> The Falcons are off the hook for the $5.5 million in base salary that Edwards was scheduled to earn next year. But the $4.65 million figure represents the outstanding portions of his pro-rated signing bonus and option bonus and all of that will be accelerated toward the 2013 cap. Edwards had been scheduled to count $7.05 million toward next year 's cap prior to his release. <p> Edwards still will count $3.315 million toward this year 's cap. But that number is down from the $4.55 million he would have cost if he spent the whole season with the Falcons. <p> All totaled, Edwards received $10,764,705.88 from the Falcons
