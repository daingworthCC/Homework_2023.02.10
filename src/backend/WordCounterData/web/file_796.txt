5106941 <h> Nature lovers, it 's time for all of us to do our election homework <p> Before you vote, take a moment to think. Clear your mind, close your eyes, and breathe deeply. Picture sitting on the warm sand at your favorite Connecticut beach last summer. Remember all the birds at your feeder this morning. Imagine all the trees turning slowly, gradually to their full autumn colors. Take another breath. This is the state you love, Dear Reader. Vote for it. <p> There are plenty of issues Connecticut will face in the next few years. The legislators we elect will decide on one bill to allow cell towers in public parks. Another would allow utility companies to cut trees on your property without your permission. Yet others would allow more pesticide applications near elementary schools. There are handfuls of legislation ahead that will affect the nature of Connecticut. <p> Time is getting short for you to research local candidates. Lucky for all of us, the Connecticut League of Conservation Voters, a nonpolitical nonprofit has spent the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro-environment candidates, both Republican and Democrat, to endorse for state and national office.

Since 2011, the U.S. House of Representatives has voted more than 280 times to weaken clean air, clean water and wildlife protections. Many of these measures were designed to halt progress being made to safeguard wildlife by the Department of the Interior, Environmental Protection Agency and other federal entities. Because of opposition from Congress, the president or both, few of these bills have become law. More often than not, only a handful of votes on Capitol Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the upcoming elections are especially important for the future of wildlife. <p> The National Wildlife Federation( www.NWF.org) is another apolitical nonprofit with a clear purpose -- to speak for the animals and protect the habitats and resources they need to survive. Read their write-ups on Romney and Obama 's stands on conservation. The NWF also has a clear list of upcoming legislation that will be decided by the very people you elect. Choose carefully, considering everything you care about, like nature, wildlife and the environment we all share. <p> Enjoy Guilford naturalist and children 's book author Kathleen Kudlinski 's daily nature notes and thoughts at her Pondside Place blog, **25;8030;TOOLONG.
