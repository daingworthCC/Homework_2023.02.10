5028741 <h> Sponsored Links <p> The same $100-plus price tag on a barrel of crude oil that 's driving up prices at the pump is pushing up the price of jet fuel, prompting airlines to raise ticket prices across their systems twice since the start of the year. <p> The result is fares that were 4% higher Thursday than on New Year 's Day, Rick Seaney, chief executive of FareCompare.com, which closely monitors prices, calculates. <p> Industry analysts say travelers can expect little respite from further efforts by the airlines to increase fares the rest of the year as they seek to recoup higher fuel costs and post a profit. <p> " We have n't seen anything yet, as far as where airfares are going to go, " warns George Hobica, founder of Airfarewatchdog.com, which also monitors ticket prices. " Consumers need to readjust their expectations and what they consider to be a low fare.

" <p> Driving instead, but... <p> Higher fares are prompting some business travelers to re-examine their travel plans, too, often forcing them to calculate the higher price of flying vs. the rising costs of driving, though the latter can take longer. <p> By Frank Pompa, USA TODAY <p> " Even at the $4.48( per gallon pump price) I paid a week ago, it was still less expensive than flying, " says Lou DeLuco, who drives twice a month from his home in Phoenix for business in Los Angeles in a 2004 Malibu. <p> Gasoline was at $3.80 a gallon nationally on average Tuesday, according to AAA, although it 's above $4 in places such as California. <p> The national average is edging toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $145 a barrel before the financial collapse, according to the New York Mercantile Exchange. <p> Airlines, with jet fuel making up about 35% of operating costs, are in the same situation as drivers when crude oil prices rise. <p> Last year, airlines paid an average of about $3 a gallon for kerosene-type jet fuel. That was the highest average in decades, according to the Energy Information Administration. Last week, the price hit $3.20 a gallon. <p> " Fuel remains our largest and most volatile cost, " says John Heimlich, chief economist for Airlines for America, the trade industry group representing the nation 's biggest airlines. <p> U.S. airlines spent about $50.5 billion last year on fuel, up from $38.8 billion in 2010, and they raised ticket prices nine times last year, largely to offset those costs and make a profit. All major U.S. airlines except American, which sought bankruptcy protection in November, posted a profit last year. <p> But Southwest Airlines, the most consistently profitable U.S. carrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from posting a profit for the first three months of this year. <p> Strategizing on costs <p> To protect themselves against jumps in oil prices, most airlines hedge against them by buying a sort of insurance called an option. These options allow airlines to lock in a price for a portion of their fuel for several months at today 's prices. So long as prices rise, options are valuable in keeping prices more stable. But if prices remain flat or fall, options are another expense for airlines. <p> US Airways has n't hedged its fuel buying for years. And Frontier, after hedging last year, is n't following that strategy so far this year. <p> Bryan Bedford, chief executive of Republic Airways, which owns Frontier, said in a March 1 earnings call that Frontier could have " really good margins " if fuel averaged $3.30 a gallon this year and could still be profitable at $3.50 per gallon. <p> " It 's going to remain to be seen what happens with fuel prices and fare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airlines ' profitability during times of surging oil prices is that they continue to balance supply and demand by not expanding the number of flights they have beyond people 's willingness to fly -- and pay for it. <h> Dealing with high fares <p> Airline tickets will be pricey this year, but travel industry analysts have some advice for dealing with them. <p> Plan ahead. Try to buy several months ahead of time for trips inside the USA and as much as five months ahead for international travel. <p> Watch for sales. Even with high ticket prices, airlines will have spot sales to fill seats on planes flying some routes. Sales tend to start on Tuesday and end by Thursday. <p> Be flexible. Spring prices should ease after Easter until Memorial Day. Vacation-time fares from June through early August will be more expensive. Prices are expected to drop after school starts in late August, especially for tickets to Europe.

For Europe, rather than flying into London or Paris, consider Barcelona, Dublin or Zurich. <p> Planes were 83% full last year, according to the federal Bureau of Transportation Statistics, as airlines adjusted the number of seats they made available by the number of flights they scheduled and the size of aircraft they flew on routes. Planes were 69% full in 2001. <p> To keep planes full, says Michael Derchin, an airline analyst for CRT Capital Group, the airlines reduced capacity, or supply of seats, in the fall. <p> " So far, demand has been pretty strong, " Derchin says. <p> For demand to stay strong, business travelers need to continue to fly. They are the most lucrative group of travelers because they 're willing to pay higher ticket prices to fly in business and first class, and they 'll pay a premium to fly at the last moment. <p> Business travelers are n't cutting back on travel in large numbers -- yet. <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Business Travel Coalition, which represents corporate travel managers, says he thinks the situation could change toward the end of the year. <p> Carol Powell, 55, of Colts Neck, N.J., already is concerned about the prospect. <p> Powell, who works on environmental issues for a large corporation, says the business-class tickets to Brazil that she bought two weeks ago for a trip at the end of this month were $8,300 instead of the usual $7,000. <p> " I 'm going to have a hard time with my budget this year, " she says. <p> " I 'm going to take the trips I need to take, and then at some point, I 'll have to stop because I 'll be out of money.

" If you try to buy a summer deal right now, I think you 'd be dollar-foolish. " <p> Seeking alternatives <p> Down the line, airlines want to wean themselves from high crude oil price jumps and use alternative fuel, perhaps made from sweet sorghum, grasses or trees. <p> Biofuels would reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuel that are increasingly penalized, such as through a European carbon-trading plan that charges airlines for a portion of the fuel that they burn. <p> Airlines, manufacturers such as Boeing and airports joined with the Agriculture Department in 2006 to develop biofuels. <p> The goal is to grow a fuel, have it work in a plane and be available at airports for airlines to rely upon. <p> The Air Force spurred the process by setting a goal that half its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An F/A-18 Super Hornet flew with half biofuel in April 2010, and a Seahawk helicopter powered by half biofuel flew in September 2011. <p> United and Alaska airlines flew the first commercial biofuel flights in the United States in November 2011. <p> " We do n't want to be the only industry left behind with no alternative, " says Heimlich of Airlines for America. <p> But the day of flying routinely on fuel made from plants is years away, because suppliers are still developing the fuels and airlines are still testing them to ensure they 're safe. <p> Staying high ; costs, that is <p> In the meantime, consumers should be prepared to pay more to fly unless the price of oil drops, and the Federal Aviation Administration does n't see that happening. The FAA predicts oil prices will stay above $100 a barrel this year and shoot up to $138 in the next 20 years. <p> Oil 's price volatility is preventing even some experts from predicting where prices will go the rest of the year. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some substantial amount because of geopolitical issues or because of shortages, you 're going to have to raise the price of tickets, " says Bob McAdoo, who analyzes airlines for Avondale Partners investors. <p> Right now, Farecompare 's Seaney predicts that summer prices will be " expensive -- but not overly expensive.
