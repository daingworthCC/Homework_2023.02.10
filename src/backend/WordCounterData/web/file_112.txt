5037741 <h> element <p> a component or constituent of a whole or one of the parts into which a whole may be resolved by analysis : Bricks and mortar are elements of every masonry wall. <p> 2. <p> Chemistry. one of a class of substances that can not be separated into simpler substances by chemical means. See also chart under periodic table. <p> 3. <p> a natural habitat, sphere of activity, environment, etc. : to be in one 's element ; Water is the element of fish. <p> 4. <p> elements, <p> a. <p> atmospheric agencies or forces ; weather : a ruddy complexion from exposure to the elements. <p> b. <p> the rudimentary principles of an art, science, etc. : the elements of grammar. <p> c. <p> the bread and wine of the Eucharistic service. <p> 5. <p> any group of people singled out within a larger group by identifiable behavior patterns, common interests, ethnic similarities, etc. : He worried that the protest rally would attract the radical element. <p> Origin : 1250 -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elementum one of the four elements, letter of the alphabet, first principle, rudiment <p> Related forms <p> interelement, adjective, noun <p> subelement, noun <p> Synonyms Element, component, constituent, ingredient refer to units that are parts of whole or complete substances, systems, compounds, or mixtures. Element denotes a fundamental, ultimate part : the basic elements of matter ; resolve the problem into its elements. Component and constituent refer to a part that goes into the making of a complete system or compound. Component often refers to one of a number of parts : a new component for the stereo system. Constituent suggests a necessary part of the whole : The constituents of a molecule of water are two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen. Ingredient is most frequently used in nonscientific contexts : the ingredients of a cake ; the ingredients of a successful marriage. <p> 00:10 <p> Element is always a great word to know. <p> So is lye. Does it mean : <p> So is alum. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it mean : <p> with all water removed, especially water of crystallization <p> a highly concentrated, aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide, or any solution resulting from leaching or percolation <p> a double sulfate analogous to potassium alum, as aluminum ammonium sulfate, with the formula R2SO4? X2(SO4)3? 24H2O, where R is alkali metal or ammonium <p> a mixture composed of different substances or the same substance in different phases, such as solid ice and liquid water <p> any of a class of chemical compounds having the general formula ROH, where R represents an alkyl group and? OH a hydroxyl group <p> noting compounds that readily decompose or change into other compounds <p> A substance that can not be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means. An element is composed of atoms that have the same atomic number, that is, each atom has the same number of protons in its nucleus as all other atoms of that element. Today 115 elements are known, of which 92 are known to occur in nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accelerators. Eighty-one of the elements have isotopes that are stable. The others, including technetium, promethium, and those with atomic numbers higher than 83, are radioactive. See Periodic Table. <p> Mathematics A member of a set. <p> Our Living Language : When Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev devised the Periodic Table in 1869, there were 63 known elements. Mendeleev classified the known elements by atomic weight, and arranged a table listing them with vertical rows corresponding to shared chemical characteristics. Gaps in the table suggested the possibility of elements not yet discovered, and indeed elements were later discovered, or in some cases, artificially created, that filled the gaps and had the expected chemical properties. The striking correlation between the atomic weight of an element and its chemical properties was later explained by quantum mechanical theories of the atom. The weight of an atom of any given element depends on the number of protons( and neutrons) in its nucleus, but the number of protons also determines the number and arrangement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these outer shells of electrons that largely determine the element 's chemical properties. Currently, 115 distinct elements are known. <h> element definition <p> In chemistry, any material( such as carbon, hydrogen, iron, or oxygen) that can not be broken down into more fundamental substances. Each chemical element has a specific type of atom, and chemical compounds are created when atoms of different elements are bound together into molecules. There are 119 chemical elements whose discovery has been claimed ; 92 occur in nature, and the rest have been produced in laboratories. <h> element definition <p> 1. One of the items of data in an array. 2. One kind of node in an SGML, HTML, or XML document tree. An SGML element is typically represented by a start tag( " <p> ") and an end tag( " <p> "). In some SGML implementations, some tags are omissible, as with " " in HTML. The start tag can contain attributes( " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that element. Both the start tag and end tag for an element typically contain the " tag name "( also called the " GI " or generic identifier) for that element. In XML, an element is always represented either by an explicit start tag and end tag, or by an empty element tag( " "). Other kinds of SGML node are : a section of character data( " foo "), a comment( " "), a markup declaration( " "), or a
