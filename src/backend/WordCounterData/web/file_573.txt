5084241 <h> Look Back : Great Flood of 1993 <p> Caskets that had been unearthed by the surging Missouri River at Hardin, in western Missouri, line state Highway 10 on Aug. 14, 1993, where the water left them. The Missouri broke a levee on July 12, 1993, and scoured the cemetery, digging a deep hole and sending caskets bobbing downstream, some as many as 25 miles. All told, the flood ruined 793 of the 1828-vintage cemetery 's 1,576 graves, and searchers never confirmed recovering about 150 of them. In 1998, the cemetery installed a bronze memorial to the names from the gravesites than never were recovered. Hardin is in Ray County, on the north bank of the Missouri about 45 miles east
