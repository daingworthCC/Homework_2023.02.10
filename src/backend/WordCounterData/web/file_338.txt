5060541 <h> What do you think of your provider? <p> As far as providers go, I 'm talking about the 4 main providers, Verizon, AT &T,; T-Mobile, Metro PCS, and Sprint. Tell me what you think about yours- is it great, sh*tty, too expensive, etc. I have Verizon. I can really only vouch for cell phone coverage since I have Charter for interwebz, home phone, and cable, but as far as cell phone coverage goes, Verizon is great. the coverage is great, and it 's not too costly( although I do n't have a smartphone to pay for). Customer care is pretty easy to deal with too. Overall, they 're a great provider. Now tell me what you think. Also, can someone add Sprint to the poll? I left that one out the first time. <h> Re : What do you think of your provider? <p> Home cable, phone and internet are provided by Virgin Media. We get a maximum speed of 20Mbps. Even though it is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, we still always get around 19.8Mbps. My mobile phone is on O2, good pricing and tariff features. <h> Re : What do you think of your provider? <p> I have AT &T; on my phone, but both of my parents have Verizon. Basically, where we are moving to does n't have any cell towers that provide Verizon. I love AT &T.; Excellent service I must say. As far as internet goes we have Windtream iwht a 3Mbps speed. When we move into our new house it will get upgraded to a 6. <h> Re : What do you think of your provider? <p> AT &T,; we currenlty have normal dsl, and we only get 6 max mbps on the biggest plan avalible, and as for my samsung captivate, the speed is as fast as my home internet, and no i do nt have 4g on my phone, only 3g, but my phone does have at &t's; enhanced 3g service <h> Re : What do you think of your provider? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my phone, but both of my parents have Verizon.
