Heinlein, " We proceed down the path marked by his ideas. He shows us where the future is. " Nowhere is this more true than in Heinlein 's gripping tale of revolution on the moon in 2076, where " Loonies " are kept poor and oppressed by an Earth-based Authority that turns huge profits at their expense.

Heinlein, four-time winner of the Hugo Award and recipient of three Retro Hugos, received the first Grand Master Nebula Award for lifetime achievement. His worldwide bestsellers have been translated into 22 languages and include Stranger in a Strange Land, Starship Troopers, Time Enough for Love, and The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress. His long-lost first novel, For Us, the Living, was recently published by Scribner and Pocket Books. <p> Written at the peak of Robert A. Heinlein 's creative powers in the mid-sixties, " The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress " ranks with " Stranger in a Strange Land " as his most popular and acclaimed novel. Heinlein was furiously ingenious at this stage in his career, and this novel is an incredible feat of imagination, intellect, and writing talent. It is, however, a difficult and heavy novel( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, loaded with hard science and even harder politics : Heinlein at his best is a writer who attracts and repels the reader at the same time, and no one could read " The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress " without forming some very strong opinions about it. <p> The story follows a revolution on the lunar colonies against Earth authority. The lunar colony was originally a penal colony, but even though the lunar residents( " Loonies " as they call themselves) are no longer technically prisoners, they have become economic slaves of the Earth. Also, because of their adaptation to the Moon 's lower gravity, they can not safely return to live on Earth, so their exile is a permanent one. Amidst growing but unorganized discontent amongst the Loonies, four remarkable individuals begin the meticulous planning of a revolution to free the Moon : Mannie, an engineer and our narrator ; Prof. de la Paz ; fiery Wyoming " Wyoh " Knott ; and a newly sentient supercomputer named Mike. Starting from this small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how can the nearly defenseless colonists and miners face down the juggernaut of the nations of Earth? Mike has an ingenious solution : " Throw rocks at em "... literally! <p> Told through Mannie 's point of view, the novel is written in a clipped, abbreviated style that represents the Loonie version of English : many pronouns and articles are dropped, leading to sentences like : " Stomach was supposed to be empty. But I filled helmet with sourest, nastiest fluid you would ever go a long way to avoid. " This takes a few pages to get accustomed to, but soon you wo n't notice the odd style at all and accept it as part of the book 's revolutionary spirit. <p> Heinlein unfolds the revolution in a meticulously detailed style, using lengthy conversations between the characters about how to step-by-step overthrow the authority of an overwhelming power. Heinlein not only provides in-depth details on the technology, but also of the philosophy of revolution and the unusual customs of the Loonies( such as their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novels, this is a trip for the mind, and you have to be prepared to do plenty of thinking along with the passages of action. The novel does tend to drag somewhat in the middle, but the last hundred pages are feverish with both action and ideas. <p> Where Heinlein really triumphs in this novel is in the characterization of Mike the computer. Mike, along with Hal from " 2001, " is one of great artificial intelligences in science fiction. You will quickly forget, as Mannie does, that Mike is a disembodied voice from a machine, and instead think of him( or sometimes her ') as another character. Mike 's growth from his shaky beginnings as a thinking being is fascinating and one of Heinlein 's great achievements as an author. <p> However, if you are new to Robert A. Heinlein( or science fiction in general), this is n't the novel to start with( and neither is " Stranger in a Strange Land "). You should ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the 1950s, most of which were aimed at teenagers but are nonetheless wonderful books that anyone can enjoy : " Have Space Suit -- Will Travel, " " Starman Jones, " and " Citizen of the Galaxy " are good places to start. Also recommended : " The Puppet Masters " and Heinlein 's short stories from the 1930s and 40s collected in " The Man Who Sold the Moon " and " The Green Hills of Earth. " You should definitely read " The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress " -- it 's an essential classic of the genre -- but you may need to build up to it. After all, as Loonies say : " TANSTAAFL! "( " There ai n't no such thing as a free lunch! ") <p> I just re-read The Moon is a Harsh Mistress after not having read it since I was a teenager.( Well, that was in the 60 's, oof.) I must say, this book holds up well against science fiction written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 90 's that made computers a household item and not just a device at work that spewed out yellow punchtape. <p> Heinlein attended Annapolis and was in the Navy ; his experiences feed into many of his books( most famously, Starship Troopers.) And the theme of liberty, alternate marriage styles, animate computers also turn up in many of his works( Time Enough for Love.) Heinlein was kind of a libertarian ; his ideas about society show up in many of his novels. <p> The endearing part of this book is the wonderful relationship between Mannie, jack-of-all-trades and computer technician, and Mike, the self-aware computer that runs everything on the Moon from the air systems and transport to accounting and telephones. The moon has been settled by various countries( Russia, US, China) and has been turned into a penal-colony and excess population dumping zone. The government is lead by the Warden, who views the post as a sinecure, and aside from keeping general order, does nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and transportees have been left to set up a semi-anarchic society ruled mainly by common sense.( As long as you leave your neighbors in peace, they 'll do the same for you.) <p> However, when Manny attends a Free Luna rally, he learns that the resources of the moon are being depleted and that without halting the one-way export of resources to the earth, the moon and its inhabitants will be soon be doomed to starvation. Manny joins an ad-hoc revolutionary cabal with his friend the Professor and blonde hot-head Wyoming Knott. Together with Mike the computer, who has an enviable insider view of everything that goes on and a puckish sense of humor, they found the Revolution with a novel cell structure depending on the savvy computer 's abilities to remember everything and keep a secret. Mike takes on the alter-ego as Adam Selene, the revolutionary leader( and bit of a stuffed-shirt) and the struggle begins. <p> How the Revolution is fought and won is an exciting tale. The end is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone does survive the heroic struggle for freedom. This is a must-read science fiction book in my opinion, and one of Heinlein 's best. <p> This is my favorite Heinlein novel, and I 've read all of Heinlein 's works. It is a great mixture of adventure, humor, politics, technology, some thought provoking looks at alternate types of marriages, and the most lovable sentient computer ever to grace the pages of a novel. Mike( the computer) is really the star of this book, from loving to tell jokes, to deciding to help a group of revolutionary-minded Luna ' citizens ' actually accomplish their dreams of freedom because the human interaction would keep him from being lonely. <p> Along the path to revolution, Heinlein,( as usual), inserts thoughts and ideas that challenge your basic assumptions about what is right, normal, necessary, or appropriate. Is a representative democracy the only ' good ' form of government? What 's so sacred about a ' majority '? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the representatives pay for their pet projects out of their own pocket - taxes not allowed!). Are polygamy, polyandry, or other forms of multiple marriage wrong or can they be used to help preserve the stability of a child-rearing environment? How do you most efficiently organize a revolutionary group that must be kept secret from the authorities( given the assumption that there will always be ' stool pigeons ')? <p> Some have quite correctly noted that this book should not be read by ultra-grammarians, as it is told in first person Luna-speak, an odd pidgin mixture of English and Russian, with occasional items thrown in from Chinese, Finnish, and several other languages. Far from being a detriment, I consider this to be a great accomplishment. Most writers have trouble accurately portraying the dialect, say, of the Deep South in a convincing manner. Here, Heinlein has created his own dialect of the future - and makes you believe it. <p> This book is not quite as deep as Stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great books, but it has a faster, more action oriented pace, and characters that you will get emotionally involved with. I cried at the end of this book the first time I read it( and the second, and the third...) and I think you will too. TANSTAAFL indeed - but in
