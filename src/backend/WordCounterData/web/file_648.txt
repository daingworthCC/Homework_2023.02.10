5091841 <p> I 've been married for16 years and I feel unwanted from my husband and its been like this for about 10years ca n't deal with it anymore. When I came up to him and told him he said if I wanted a divorce. Please help me out with some advise. <h> First make an appointment with <p> one of the better hair salons or beauty shop ask around for a good stylist. Get a new hair cut/curl and or color. <p> you owe it to your self. Then on to the Elizabeth Arden counter at a dept store,( or a free make over if they have one going.) and have them test you for base, lip color. You do not have to buy now just ask for a little to test on your skin. you may then go on line on e/b and fine EA products at big savings. I like Estee Lauder. Now if you can afford it, hop on over to a coldwater creek store if you have one and have them help you with a good fitting pair of jeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, fix face, put on new clothes. fix " Him " mack &; cheese( add Tsp. butter) and do n't say a word! should he ask Tell him you thought it was time for a change and you ENJOYED the company of all the people who helped you get a new look. <p> Now this may not solve your problem I can guarantee you will feel better. He will notice! and you have earned it. A little prayer wo n't hurt. <h> Wow. Time to think about your marriage and make some plans. <p> Vero, <p> If I were in your situation, I 'd think about a few things like, do you have kids? How are they doing? I want love from my husband, but am I giving him what he wants in return? Is he showing his love for me in a different way than I need him to show it? Think back to when you were dating. What attracted you to him? What did he like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of you change over time. Change is n't necessarily bad, but can be scary. Do the two of you take time for a date night every week? Do you try to discuss things that come up where you disagree, or do you just take for granted that it 's going to end a certain way? <p> Only the two of you know how your marriage is really going. Think about how he treats you, how you treat him. Are you working as a team, or drifting apart, or fighting to keep the family on track? What would you like to see changed? What 's causing the tension? <p> Marriage works best when both parties have the same values, when both put about the same priority on problems that come up. No marriage is smooth and happy all the time. Feeling unwanted is usually a pretty good sign that you are n't getting what you need to be happy. But, there are ways to explore getting your needs met. You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you are n't putting up with abuse. If he 's not abusive, you can probably turn your marriage around and enjoy the rest of your lives together. If he is, consider getting professional help. <p> Problems that have been going on for ten years wo n't get solved overnight. It will take both of you working together to build the trust again, and feel more loved, and it will take time and patience. Think about little things you could do to show your love for him. Sometimes, if you are extra nice, it 's easier for him to be extra nice. What did you used to do that made the time fly by? What did you love about him, back when you felt all gushy and romantic, if you did? Or, if you just started out being friends, what did you used to talk about? To do together? See if he wants to do some of those things again. Or, if he has new interests that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with you, if they do n't go against your moral principles. If they do, you have a bigger problem, what I call a values problem. Sometimes a little compromise can go a long way, and sometimes one member of the couple is always the one to compromise, and the relationship is uneven. Communication is the key to keeping your marriage fresh and alive. <p> If you love him, tell him how much you love him and what he means to you. Be honest with your feelings, and with him. Men tend to hide their feelings. There 's not much you can do to encourage him to talk about them except to listen and give him a chance to express it. That 's the hard part, to wait for him to express his feelings. Some men just wo n't, and the more you try to draw them out, the harder they close up. It 's better, in my opinion, to just express love and see what happens. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not. But, you ca n't control what he does. You can control what you do, what you say. If you express love in words, actions, and maybe, little presents or notes, maybe he will be touched and follow suit. <p> After 16 years, it 's hard to let go. Sometimes a marriage can just turn into parallel roads instead of pulling as a team, because maybe life has been such a struggle. Therapy can help, but therapy is a process where your therapist suggests things to try that may improve communication and help revive the love. If you or he are n't willing to try things to save the marriage, it wo n't work. Both of you have to believe that it 's possible to feel close to one another again. You need to be sure neither of you is abusing the other. Abuse is always a red flag, and you should consider a therapist. But, if it 's just a sense of drifting apart, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy being married again. Just try to remind each other of the happier times. <p> When the kids get older, sometimes life slows down a bit, and the urgency to get along for the sake of the kids is n't as powerful. You do n't feel as needed because the kids do n't need as much from you and may prefer their peers. It 's easy for a marriage to stall then, because the roles have changed some. What used to be true, is n't, or does n't apply because expectations have changed. Teens get ready for college, or rebel, or both. Their friends become more important. These changes multiply any problems already in the marriage. Maybe both of you do n't feel as needed because the kids are older. Or, if you do n't have kids, maybe you 've gotten into too much of a routine. <p> Try to get a perspective from a therapist, or a friend who 's not too close to the action. An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give it time. Look at things from different angles than you usually watch them. Do n't be too quick to say things are n't working. But, listen to your feelings. Try to find outlets that are healthy for stress. Set some new goals, with baby steps so you do n't get discouraged. Try different things. You might find some useful advice in this article : <p> http : **35;2488;TOOLONG... ovinggridlock.aspx? <p> Most of all, be kind to yourself, and be kind to him and all the other members of your family. Love brought you together, and love can help get you both through this difficult time. Hope I 've given you some ideas. <h> He ca n't show you love because he does n't have it himself. <p> I 'm working on the premise that neither one of you are born again Christians so please correct me right away if I 'm wrong. <p> Do n't know if you 've ever seen the movie Fireproof but it is about a marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband tells his son " You ca n't love her because you do n't have love yourself ". He is talking about God 's love. So how do we get God 's love? Until you understand that you are a wretched sinner because you 've broken God 's 10 commandments i.e. lying, stealing, hatred which is murder to God, lust which is adultery to God, blaspheming God 's name etc and therefore justly deserve God 's justice which is His wrath in a place called hell but that God made a way to save you through His Son Jesus Christ by Him( who is God Himself) came to earth to live a perfect life we could n't live, and die a death as a perfect sacrifice that was required on our behalf to take the wrath of God we deserve on Himself so that if you will repent and trust in Jesus Christ then He will save you and you 'll hate the sin you once loved and love godly things you once hated and you 'll go to heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad person saved by a very good God.( Sorry about the run-on sentence) THEN you will know God 's love because God demonstrated His love to you when He died for you while you were sinning against Him and realize you are saved for eternity and you 'll then love your spouse with a godly love that without God - obviously - ca n't have. But it 's very important that you do n't turn to God with the motivation to save your marriage because you have to come to God on HIS terms - not yours. And His terms are repentance from your sins - a turning away from them because you realize how offensive they are to God and how angry He is because of your sinning and turning towards Jesus Christ because of His love, mercy, kindness and forgiveness He extends to you. <p> I 'm sure this response will be swarmed with people who hate what I just said to you because they hate God but please do n't let that sway you. Awaken your conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then look to the cross and see Jesus Christ, God Himself, dying for you if you will respond to Him in repentance and faith. <p> Thanks for listening. I 'll be praying for you. Besides reading the Bible - John chapter 3 would be a good place to start and thinking and doing what I already described - the other thing I would suggest is to get the movie Fireproof and the corresponding book The Love Dare. Watch the movie with your husband if he is willing to do that. If not, watch it yourself. I am praying for you. <h> Actualloy, " do you want a divorce? " is a question, and I guess it 's a valid one. If you 're miserable, or unhappy, do <p> you want out of the marriage? If so, then get a divorce. If not, see f your husband will attend couple counselling to work out the issues. If he wo n't go, get some counselling on your own - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and help you make decisions for your own life while understanding the possible consequences. <p> Many older marriages go through a phase where each takes the other for granted ; sometimes this happens after the lust expires and the reality of living together sets in. There are many ways to get past ths and get to real loving, but most couples need external assistance with that. <h> His response sounds like the response of the frustrated. <p> He appears to not have any idea what he should do about this whole marriage thingie that he 's found himself stuck in. So he 's on autopilot until he does get an idea. Your demand--in his mind--amounted to an ultimatum of " Wife : lover her or leave her. " And like the hippies of old, he thought he DID love his wife. But, okay, if not, fine, I 'll leave if you want. <p> You are, therefore, required to be the one to present to him what this whole marriage thingie involves, slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And start with the fun
