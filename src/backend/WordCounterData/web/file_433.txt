They were co-workers who entertained at office parties and amateur shows. Encouraged by co-workers to cut a record, they did a demo of " You Do n't Have to Be a Baby to Cry, " a tune they discovered on the back of Tennessee Ernie Ford 's " Sixteen Tons. " They named themselves the Caravelles after the French airliner. A local company, BPR Records, liked the demo and redid the song in a professional studio. It became a big hit in the United Kingdom and was picked up by Smash Records for North American distribution, and nearly aced Billboard before nesting at number three on December 21, 1963. <p> Smash released a succession of clones but found few takers. On " Lovin ' Just My Style, " the Caravelles developed a tougher sound ; it sounds like a tune from a D-rated movie, tough biker girls yelling over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the place. Then came " Do n't Blow Your Cool, " sung in their traditional breathy harmony style. The sales were still disappointing, thus another style switch to rock/folk on " Hey Mama, You 've Been on My Mind. " A nice approach but there still was no demand for the Caravelles ' product. Lois Wilkinson left to go solo, recorded as Lois Lane, married, and appeared on BBC 's programs singing pop hits. Andrea Simpson carried on with the Caravelles until the ' 80s, recording but not hitting ; with replacements, Simpson still does the occasional gig. <p> http : **34;6329;TOOLONG... <p> *** <p> The Caravelles - You Do n't Have To Be A Baby To Cry <p> Complete Caravelis 1963-1968 <p> Everything from the nine 45s and sole LP the Caravelles issued in the U.K. from 1963-1968 is on this 31-track compilation, which also includes two tracks that only surfaced on a French EP, and even four German-language recordings. As the first official anthology of their work, it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of illustrations and first-hand quotes from the group 's Lois Wilkinson. Known almost exclusively for their 1963 hit " You Do n't Have to Be a Baby to Cry, " it proves they were a little more interesting than the one-shot novelty act they 're sometimes tagged as, though their relationship to pop/rock was usually only casual. In truth, their most widely heard songs were more throwbacks to the pre-rock era in their obviously Patience &; Prudence-inspired harmonies( that duo 's two hits were both covered on the Caravelles ' LP). Yet the spare, almost ghostly arrangements did have a hint of pre-Beatles U.K. rock, and their close, almost whispery harmonies both carry some charm and testify to a definite and somewhat offbeat talent. The material, often drawn from or influenced by pop standards, lets the duo down as much as it benefits them. They would have been well-advised to record more of their own songs, since some of their infrequent attempts at songwriting -- relegated to LP filler and B-sides -- were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Some of their post-1963 singles found them moving closer, if usually not that close, to pop/rock in both content and production, with " You Are Here " and " I Depend on You " making for fair Phil Spector-girl group-influenced tunes ; the originals " How Can I Be Sure? " and " I Like a Man " sounding quite close to Merseybeat. They were n't quite part of the girl group scene, also veering into jazz-pop with another original, " Georgia Boy, " and even rather lushly produced folk-rock on the 1967 45 " Hey Mama You 've Been on My Mind. " All this versatility did n't help get them another hit, of course. But taken together, they add up to a legacy that 's more interesting than many historians, and even British Invasion collectors, realize, though there 's some
