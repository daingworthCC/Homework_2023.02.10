5104141 <h> Inside Family Guy : Back to the Multiverse <h> IGN talks to the man bringing Family Guy to Xbox 360 and PS3. <p> by Colin Campbell <p> November 2, 2012 <p> The trouble with games based on funny TV shows, apart from the fact that they 're mostly crap, is that the characters are not the same as the ones we care about. They may look the same, possibly even sound the same, but all too often they are flimsy avatars. They are strangers. They are unfunny. <p> TV shows like Family Guy fire gags at the viewer at a phenomenal rate, literally every few seconds. They barely bother with a cohesive narrative structure because they 're too busy having fun with the characters or mocking our culture or just messing with our heads. <p> Games do n't work this way, especially unimaginative games based on expensive licenses. They present familiar worlds. The player is expected the progress well-known characters along linear paths, dealing with whatever impediments the game 's mechanics place in the way( shoot, melee, puzzle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment for comedy, exacerbated by gameplay 's inevitable reliance on repetition. The first time you see a character fall in the lake and come up with a gurning fish in his trilby, it may be amusing. Not so much the fifth time. <p> Activision 's VP of production Scott Bandy understood these problems when taking on the license, and beginning work with game studio Heavy Iron Studios and Family Guy 's production house Fuzzy Door. <p> He says, " The very initial conversation is, ' how are we going to deliver the humor that 's in this TV show with a gameplay aspect as well? ' One of the things they do a lot on the show is cutaways. A lot of the big gags are done in a cutaway. That 's something that does n't lend itself well to gameplay. So how do we deliver that in an interactive experience? " <p> The first gambit has been to install a lot of variety in the game. The TV episode - Road To The Multiverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read is Greg Miller 's preview of the game.) In this episode, Stewie and Brian use a device that lands them, briefly, in a series of alternative worlds. One such, a Disney world, allows the writers to indulge in a sugary ' Snow White ' -style song-sequence, before delivering a grotesquely illustrated joke about Walt Disney 's rumored anti-semitism. <p> So the game uses the exact same device to move its characters from one world to another. The game is said to be around nine hours long and there are ten levels and eight universes, including Amish, Frat / Greek, Pirate and ' Disabilities '. <p> " In each of those environments we adjust the humor and the jokes and the gags that we 're working with to be appropriate in that particular environment, " says Bandy. <p> " If you stretched out a four-hour experience and stayed in one environment for that long, that 's where you 're going to get fatigued. Were making it fresh enough to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guy sensibility. " <p> But what about that curse of all ' comedy ' games, the repetitious gag? " We use a lot of banter between Brian and Stewie to deliver the humor and it was definitely a challenge. There 's a balance there, walking that line between making sure we are keeping it fresh in terms of the twists and turns that the story takes and the gags that go along with it. We 're very happy with the outcome, but it was definitely a challenge. " <p> Bandy says that the writing team at Fuzzy Door have had a lot of input into salting each level with plenty of jokes. " We worked very closely with the writers from the show. The scripts, the character lists, the environments, even stuff like the posters that populate the levels. Everything was either generated by Fuzzy Door or with their very close approval. <p> " It was absolutely critical for us to be able to work closely with Seth MacFarlane and the writers on the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actors from the series. It 's got Seth 's take and his polish on the dialogue. It would have been a non-starter without that. The only way you 're going to satisfy a core fanbase as dedicated as these guys is if you can say, ' Hey, this is n't Activision thinking around what we believe a Family Guy game should be. This is us facilitating Fuzzy Door and Fox to be able to deliver their content to an audience in a new way '. " <p> Family Guy on TV has always been outandishly self-referential, and the game will take this to new levels. " Once we came up with the idea of the multiverse and the different themed settings, we went back and pored over the episodes and to pull out as many of those references or moments as we could, and just blow that out. You say, ' Okay, now let 's take that up to 11 and milk everything we can in terms of humor '. <p> " For example, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an episode where Peter is walking around as a pirate in the modern day. This is where the creativity and the experience of the Fuzzy Door guys is critical. " <p> Gags are placed in the game in much the same way as shooting-game designers place enemies. " In Call of Duty, you 'd pick the place where a bridge is going to explode. For us it was, ' This is where the gag is going to trigger. ' That was new for me as far as thinking about the way we 're doing our layout and our pacing. We ca n't do a gag every 15 seconds. But we want to make sure that the gags we do put in there are ones people experience. " <p> So, this being a video game, will there also be jokes about gaming culture? He says, " Yeah, we do some. In a licensed game, you have to be careful about other licensed games you might reference, but there are some moments in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titles in the past. There 's a lot of self-deprecating jokes. We definitely did a bit of that. " <p> Part of the delight of licensed games, when they work, is inhabiting the worlds and characters we love, and enjoying those familiar moments. We can all hope, at some point in the game, to enjoy Cleveland Brown, distressed in a bathtub, or to be tickled by Glenn Quagmire 's libido. <p> Of course, licensed TV games have a poor history in terms of game review scores. Heavy Iron has worked on games for Wall-E, The Incredibles, Spongebob and Ratatouille, none of which have exactly drowned in plaudits. <p> Bandy says, " For the hardcore gaming press guys who are looking for innovative gameplay or giant cinematic set-pieces, obviously the review scores will not be at the highest range. But it 's a high-quality offering for fans of the series, for people who are playing the game to enjoy the gameplay, but also to get to that next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think we 've made all the right moves in terms of what we 've focused on and where we 're putting our bets. It 's like any other title, though. You have to let the thing go and hopefully it 's well-received. We 've got a good solid game, and for Family Guy fans, I think it 's going to be a must-have. I really do. " <p> Note - IGN is part of News Corp. which also owns Fox. <p> For daily opinions, debates and interviews on games you
