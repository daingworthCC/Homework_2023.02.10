5093541 <h> U.S. Embassy in Beijing Has Been a Sanctuary Before <p> HONG KONG -- The saga of the late-night escape of Chen Guangcheng has been thoroughly engrossing -- the blind human rights lawyer scaling a wall at his rural farmhouse, eluding dozens of guards, stumbling through the countryside, being bundled into a getaway car and now, it seems, seeking refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. <p> Getty Images-AFP A photo taken from Chinese state TV on June 12, 1989, showed the arrest warrant for Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, a week after the couple took refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. <p> The negotiations now under way about Mr. Chen 's status are undoubtedly just as compelling, although there has so far been no leakage by officials in Beijing or Washington. The diplomatic silence is deafening. <p> Ever since the news of his daring escapade was revealed last week, China scholars, journalists, activists and tweeters have been furiously debating the case. Will Washington grant him asylum, or turn him over to Beijing? Will China allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rodham Clinton say when she comes to China this week? Will Mr. Chen 's family and close accomplices be part of an asylum package? Does he even want to leave China? <p> " Both countries appear eager to avoid a standoff that threatens to mar relations and, most immediately, to eclipse annual talks scheduled to begin in Beijing on Thursday, " my colleagues Steven Lee Myers and Andrew Jacobs write. " But Mr. Chen 's professed desire to remain in China could result in a prolonged stalemate that undercuts cooperation on other global security issues. " <p> They quote a Chinese academic at a government research institute in Beijing who says, " Chinese leaders face a huge headache right now. I do n't see any easy way out of this mess. " <p> There 's something of a precedent for Mr. Chen 's situation : the defection in 1989 of two renowned physicists, Fang Lizhi and his wife Li Shuxian.

" Chinese dissidents have learned over the past two decades that exile leads to a sharp decline in a person 's ability to make a difference inside China. <p> " Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Peace Prize winner who is now in his third year of an eleven-year prison sentence for ' subversion, ' made it clear after his arrest that he would not accept exile as an alternative to prison. From what friends of Chen in Beijing have been saying in recent days, it seems that Chen is taking a similar position. " <p> Mr. Fang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but was less well-known by everyday Chinese. Mr. Chen, on the other hand, has achieved something of a national reputation as a plucky battler against official corruption and as a campaigner for the rights of women and the disabled. <p> " Chen is seen not as an elite intellectual but as an ' ordinary person ' who taught himself law to help other ordinary people, and then was imprisoned and persecuted -- and is blind to boot, " Mr. Link said. " For the Chinese authorities to accuse him of treason or to blame meddling foreigners for helping him will be a hard sell. " <p> Mr. Fang 's lectures and speeches against the government and the Chinese Communist Party got him fired from his teaching post in 1987. <p> " Students were charmed ; the authorities were not, " Mr. Link wrote in a remembrance of Mr. Fang, who died last month in Tucson, Arizona, at age 76. The Times obituary by Michael Wines is here. <p> " He became the spirit behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mr. Link, who was living in Beijing at the time. <p> He said the couple 's son initially approached him about helping his parents. Security officials were becoming ever more threatening, and Mr. Fang and Ms. Li wanted to know if Mr. Link would sound out U.S. diplomats about possibly sheltering them. <p> " Around noon on June 4, the day of the massacre, I went to Fang 's and Li 's apartment, " Mr. Link writes. " Their doorbell, as always, played the tune ' Happy Birthday to You. ' " <p> Later that afternoon, they telephoned Mr. Link and invited his children to tea -- their pre-arranged code for help. He spirited them to a hotel room that he had rented and then got them into the embassy compound the next morning. <p> After several hours of discussion with U.S. diplomats, Mr. Fang and Ms. Li, uncertain about how to proceed, decided to leave the embassy. Mr. Link took them to another hotel, the Jianguo, where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Washington Post correspondent who was in Shanghai at the time. Mr. Link left them around 7 p.m. <p> When he repeatedly called the hotel room the next morning, there was no answer : U.S. diplomats had come in the night to invite the dissident scientists back to the embassy " as the guests of President George Bush. " <p> " Washington apparently had realized that if something bad happened to Fang and Li, and if it were known that they had entered the embassy and been sidled away, the U.S. administration would have been in for some fierce criticism, " Mr. Link said. <p> Mr. Fang and Ms. Li spent the next 13 months at the embassy, living in a windowless basement apartment. <p> " Mr. Fang is said to have remarked that he is an astrophysicist but could not even see the sky, " Nicholas Kristof wrote in The Times upon the couple 's release in June 1990. They spent the next two decades in exile. <p> Mr. Fang, a friend and collaborator of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arizona
