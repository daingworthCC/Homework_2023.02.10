We are currently an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition, exploration, and development of prospective resource properties. Our current business focus is to implement the terms of our assignment agreements with Tim Cooksey Oil, LLC(? Tim Cooksey Oil?) pursuant to which we acquired a 1.57% working interest in two wells identified as Charles Prior #1A and #2A located in Franklin County, Illinois( the? Charles Prior Project?) in consideration of a payment of $25,000, and with CJT.JKV Oil Development, LLC(? JKV Oil Development?), pursuant to which we acquired a 3% working interest in five wells collectively identified as the Sesser Wells located in Franklin County, Illinois( the? Sesser Wells?) in consideration of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became interested in the prospect of working interests in oil wells through online research. After conducting research, they determined that oil and gas investments could be an excellent long term strategy. Mr. and Ms. Paquet first became affiliated with Tim Cooksey Oil through an online posting whereby JKV Management Consulting, LLC(? JKV Consulting?) was presenting interests in various oil wells, including ones from Tim Cooksey Oil. JKV Consulting, of which Mr. Villines is the President, maintains an online posting of wells in which Mr. Villines, or one of his companies, owns a working interest because as an owner of such interests it is in Mr. Villines best interest to sell the remaining working interests since the sale of working interests to additional owners thereby amounts to a smaller proportion of operating and pumping expenses that Mr. Villines and other owners have to pay for the wells. Mr. Paquet initiated contact with the President of JKV Consulting, Mr. Jefferson Villines(? Mr. Villines?), which ultimately led to the purchase of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooksey(? Mr. Cooksey?) acting as the operator( the? Operator?) of the wells. Further research led to the decision that taking the Company public would provide the best opportunity to facilitate future financing. Mr. and Ms. Paquet did not agree to form the Company or to serve as an officer or director of the Company in any part due to a plan, agreement, or understanding that they would solicit, participate in, or facilitate the sale of the enterprise to( or a business combination with) a third party looking to obtain or become a public reporting entity. Further Mr. and Ms. Paquet have no such intention to do so. <p> Mr. Villines has a retained a 5 percent( 5%) interest in the Charles Prior Project and a fifteen percent( 15%) interest in the Sesser Wells( with both projects hereinafter referred to as the? Well Projects?), with both interests held through JKV Oil Development. Through JKV Consulting, Mr. Villines coordinates with Mr. Cooksey, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eader(? Mr. Eader?), to oversee the drilling of the Well Projects. The drilling of the Well Projects is being conducted by George Mitchell Drilling, an unaffiliated third party. Neither Mr. Villines nor his affiliated companies, JKV Consulting, and JKV Oil Development( collectively the? Affiliated Companies?), have received any compensation or commission in conjunction with the assignment of either of the Wells Projects in which the Company owns working interests. Other than the interests Mr. Cooksey has retained in the Charles Prior Project and the Sesser Wells, and Mr. Cooksey? s role as Operator of the Well Projects, Mr. Cooksey and Mr. Villines and his Affiliated Companies do not have any related affiliations or written agreements or contracts ; however, they hold working interests in other non-affiliated wells together. <p> We entered into operating agreements with Tim Cooksey Oil on July 25, 2010 for the Charles Prior Project and on September 1, 2010, for the Sesser Wells. Pursuant to the terms of our agreements with Tim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Operator for the drilling, testing and completion of the subject wells and we agreed to share the proportionate ongoing operating fees and pumping expenses of the Charles Prior Project as such fees were waived for the Sesser Wells as part of our negotiations for acquiring the working interest in the Sesser Wells ; however, we are not responsible for any additional Operator expenses such as drilling, testing, or completion of the wells. If the wells are viable and can be developed, we will receive a pro-rata share of any revenues equivalent to our working interest in the wells. If the wells are not viable, we expect the Operator to plug the wells ; however, we will not be responsible for any portion of the costs related to plugging the wells. Additionally, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the agreements with Tim Cooksey Oil, LLC, we are severally liable for environmental and any other liabilities with regards to the Well Projects ; however, we are only liable to the extent of our working interest in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be small as compared to the percentage of liability for the entire working interest, but such liability could still pose a material risk to our investment. <p> 5 <p> There are leases underlying the wells in which we own working interests ; however we are not the holder of any of these leases and therefore we are not responsible for the payment or evaluation of any obligations under such leases. Tim Cooksey Oil is responsible for paying and maintaining the leases and has informed the Company that the amount of work done on both of the leases has far exceeded the amount of work necessary to maintain the leases. The lessee may lose substantial portions or all of the entire property underlying our Well Projects due to operating and environmental hazards, which either have not been insured against or can not be insured against. This could result in a potential reduction of our working interests in the Well Projects, or even losing such interests in their entirety. Additionally, government regulations could either increase the cost of operations on the Well Projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the properties underlying the Well Projects. Further, we may be subject to partial payment for such liabilities according to our working interests in the Well Projects. The payment of such liabilities could reduce the funds available to us or could result in a total loss of our working interests. The occurrence of any of these events could significantly reduce our revenues, cause substantial losses or impair our future operating results and liquidity as our working interests in the Well Projects are the only assets we currently have. <p> The Charles Prior Project is located in the Illinois Basin approximately 100 miles southeast of St. Louis, Missouri. The authorized work program under the joint venture includes drilling, testing and completion of the two wells to a total depth of 3,800 +/- to check the Rosiclare Sandstone and Salem formation for hydrocarbons to be abstracted and sold. The Sesser Wells are also located in the Illinois Basin approximately 100 miles southeast of St. Louis, Missouri. The authorized work program under the joint venture includes drilling, testing and completion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ +/- to check the St Louis formations for hydrocarbons to be abstracted and sold. The work program on the Sesser Wells commenced in August of 2010. If we are successful in generating revenues from our joint ventures, we intend to acquire working interests in additional wells in the project area. Subject to obtaining additional financing we intend to acquire further resource or mineral projects. <p> Although we are currently focused on projects located in certain geographic regions, we continually evaluate attractive resource opportunities in other geographic areas. Our current focus is on acquiring working interests in oil and/or gas wells in the states of Texas, Illinois, California, and in the province of Alberta, Canada. However, we have not entered into negotiations or discussions for any of these purchases as we are merely exploring the areas for potential opportunities. Further, we do not have any reserves on any of our wells as there has not been any reserve reports conducted on the properties underlying the wells. We have limited operating income and, as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations and to implement our growth strategy. <p> Mr. and Ms. Paquet, our executive officers, currently reside in Quebec, Canada and while neither has technical training or prior experiences in the oil and gas industry, Mr. Paquet has prior project management, and business experience. Additionally, Mr. Andersen, who serves solely as a director of the Company, is a licensed geologist with experience in mineral and petroleum exploration, and he has verbally agreed to devote 10-11 hours per week to the Company. Further Mr. Villines, who also serves solely as a director of the Company, has years of experience in the oil and gas industry as the President of both JKV Consulting, a consulting Company located in Texas, which focuses on development and exploration of oil and gas projects and JKV Oil Development, an asset holding company which focuses on oil and gas interests. In addition, Mr. Villines has managed the promotion of developmental and exploratory oil and gas projects to private and institutional bodies, as well as providing private consulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. These experiences have given him the skills necessary to evaluate acquisitions, to direct drilling projects and to manage all aspects of extracting oil and gas, including selling the output. Mr. Villines has verbally agreed to devote 2 hours per week to the Company. <p> While neither Mr. nor Ms. Paquet has visited the subject property, one of the Company? s directors, Mr. Villines has visited both of the properties in which the Company currently owns working interests on two occasions. Specifically, Mr. Villines visited the properties once in May of 2010 and once in November of 2010. Additionally, during the negotiations to purchase the Well Projects and subsequent to the purchase, JKV Consulting, of which Mr. Villines is the President, provided the Company with photos and videos of the properties and the associated drilling work. <p> To date, we have earned $2,304 revenues, have cash on hand of $409,546 and have incurred a net loss of $( 100,042) in the period from inception through July 31, 2012. We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we enter into commercial production of our working interests in our Well Projects. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company? s ability to continue as a going concern. The continuation of our company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from our shareholders, the ability of our company to obtain necessary equity financing to achieve our operating objectives, and the attainment of profitable operations from our working interests in oil wells. <p> 6 <p> Charles Prior Project <p> On July 29, 2010, we entered into an assignment agreement( the? CP Assignment Agreement?) with Tim Cooksey Oil pursuant to which we acquired a 1.57% working interest in the following two wells located in Franklin County, Illinois in consideration of a payment of $25,000. Tim Cooksey Oil is responsible for paying and maintaining the lease and the Charles Prior lease encompasses 80 acres. As granted by the Charles Prior Lease agreement between Tim Cooksey Oil and the owner of the Charles Prior Project, Tim Cooksey Oil holds an 80% lease net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Prior Project underlying lease, which is further documented in the CP Assignment Agreement. This results in the Company having a net revenue interest of approximately 1.26% in the Charles Prior Project. JKV Oil Development, of which our director, Mr. Villines, is the President, owns a five percent( 5%) working interest in the Charles Prior Project. <p> Charles Prior #1A : <p> In August of 2010, drilling operations were commenced. Charles Prior #1A(? CP 1?) was drilled to a total depth of approximately 3,500 feet. CP 1 had a high volume of gas and had to put the well on a choke. The well was choked back and put online averaging 40 to 50 BOPD. CP 1 had drilling mud come up the well bore, which restricted the oil production, and this was resolved this with acid treatments. Prior to acidizing, the Operator swabbed the well to determine the type of chemical combination needed to dissolve all of the mud to make the acidizing process more efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, on or about June 27, 2011 the Operator decided to drill 2 legs on the well. This involved using a tool deep underground to drill out twenty feet in two different directions so that the oil would flow in at a higher level from both sides. This has caused the oil to flow at a faster pace, but the Operator will continually evaluate CP 1 to see if any additional steps need to be taken to increase production. <p> Charles Prior #2A : <p> The well has been perforated and acidized. Charles Prior #2A(? CP 2?) will be producing from three pay zones, which will be on the pump jack. The well was fraced using a water frac, which had the objective of breaking up the rock in the formation to allow the oil to flow more easily. During a water frac, water and sand are pumped down the well at high pressure over the course of one day. This fluid is then pumped out of the well over an extended time period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 1,400 barrels of fluid, composed primarily of water and sand. The pumping of the fluid resulting from the frac took place from approximately November 18, 2010 to January 18, 2011. Over this time period, the well pumped out an average of 100 barrels of fluid per day. The pumped fluid was composed primarily of water and sand with approximately 6% oil. The Operator intends to determine the effect drilling 2 legs has had on the CP 1 well, and based on the outcome, may perform the same procedure with the CP 2 well to increase the flow of fluid. As of November 30, 2011, there has not been any additional testing or treatments performed on the CP 2 well. The Operator does not have any plans to conduct testing on CP 2 as the well has already been drilled, and the Operator does not have any immediate plans to conduct treating on the wells, but he may decide to do so after re-evaluating the production of the well. <p> Fees and Revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumping fees on the Charles Prior Project are estimated to be approximately $1,500 per month. Due to the Company? s 1.57% working interest, the Company anticipates paying $23.55 per month in operating expenses for the Charles Prior Project, not including any saltwater disposal fees, which have not been incurred by the Company as of yet. <p> Since November of 2010, division orders were being processed by the Operator, Tim Cooksey Oil. Countrymark Cooperative, LLP(? Countrymark?) has purchased the oil from the Operator. Other than these division orders, the Company does not have any delivery commitments and enters into purchase orders as the oil becomes available. The Operator will be performing daily maintenance on the wells, but there will be no more drilling on the Charles Prior Project. <p> Sesser Wells <p> On December 17, 2010, we entered into an assignment agreement( the? Sesser Assignment Agreement?) with JKV Oil Development pursuant to which we acquired a 3% working interest in the following wells located in Franklin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Tim Cooksey Oil is responsible for paying and maintaining the lease and the Sesser lease encompasses 500 acres. As granted by the Sesser Lease Agreement between Tim Cooksey Oil and the owner of the Sesser Wells, Tim Cooksey Oil holds an 80% lease net revenue interest in the Sesser Wells, pursuant to the Sesser Wells underlying lease, which is further documented in the Sesser Assignment Agreement. This results in the Company having a net revenue interest of 2.4% in the Sesser Wells. JKV Oil Development, of which our director, Mr. Villines, is the President, retained a fifteen percent( 15%) working interest in the Sesser Wells. <p> The Sesser Wells consist of( i) three exploratory wells,( ii) one new well referred to as the Illinois Minerals #1-A( the? Illinois Well?), and( i) one injection well. The three exploratory wells have previously been drilled, and have produced oil in the past ; however, as they are older wells they could be entirely depleted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water into the exploratory wells to bring any remaining oil to the surface. This is accomplished by recharging the formation of the wells to produce a higher volume of oil from the past producing wells. Additionally, drilling was commenced on the Illinois Well in August of 2010. <p> 7 <p> As of February 7, 2011, the final well reports indicated that the Illinois Well had been drilled to a total depth of 3,500 feet. Around July 14, 2011, the Operator injected water into the water injection well in order for the water to push the oil over to the Illinois Well to increase production. In the event this does not increase production, the operator may decide to treat the wells with chemicals if there is paraffin, or a waxy buildup, caking the perforations of the well bore, but the operator has no immediate plans to do this as he would like to continually re-evaluate how much oil is being produced from the Illinois Well. <p> The aggregate operating and pumping fees on the Sesser Wells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, as part of the negotiations for receiving the working interest, the Company is currently not responsible for any operating fees for the Sesser Wells. The Operator has informed the Company that operating fees will be assessed against the Company once the division orders are processed. Due to the Company? s 3% working interest in the Sesser Wells, once the Company is responsible for the operating fees for the Sesser Wells, the Company anticipates its share of the operating fees shall be approximately $22.50 per month, not including any saltwater disposal fees, which have not been incurred by the Company as of yet. The Sesser Wells were being refitted for new drilling equipment, but there will be no more drilling on the wells in the near future. However, the Operator may decide to perform new drillings on the production wells if needed. The Company does not have any delivery commitments and enters into purchase orders as the oil becomes available ; therefore, the level of oil in tanks fluctuates. <p> The hydrocarbons being extracted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself and a small amount of natural gas. The oil being extracted and produced from the Well Projects is the only hydrocarbon currently being sold, and thus the only hydrocarbon currently generating revenue for the Company. While there is natural gas being produced from the Well Projects, it is an insufficient amount to be viable for sale ; therefore, the natural gas is not generating revenue for the Company and it is solely being used to power the pump jacks to further extract oil from the Well Projects. <p> Corporate Developments <p> On June 1, 2012, Future Energy, Corp., a Nevada corporation( the? Company?) appointed Mr. Chester Ku(? Mr. Ku?) as a director of the Company. Mr. Ku accepted such appointment. <p> On or about June 4, 2012, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada a Certificate of Change to its Articles of Incorporation( the? Certificate of Change?). As a result of the Certificate of Change, the Company has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five hundred million( 500,000,000) and increased the authorized number of shares of preferred stock to two hundred million( 200,000,000). <p> Government Regulations <p> The production and sale of oil and gas is subject to regulation by state, federal, and local authorities. In most areas there are statutory provisions regulating the production of oil and natural gas under which administrative agencies may set allowable rates of production and promulgate rules in connection with the operation and production of such wells, ascertain and determine the reasonable market demand of oil and gas, and adjust allowable rates with respect thereto. <p> The sale of liquid hydrocarbons was subject to federal regulation under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, which amended various acts, including the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973. These regulations and controls included mandatory restrictions upon the prices at which most domestic crude oil and various petroleum products could be sold. All price controls and restrictions on the sale of crude oil at the wellhead have been withdrawn. It is possible, however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when, if ever, such re-imposition might occur and the effect thereof on us can not be predicted. <p> The sale of certain categories of natural gas in interstate commerce is subject to regulation under the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978(? NGPA?). Under the NGPA, a comprehensive set of statutory ceiling prices applies to all first sales of natural gas unless the gas is specifically exempt from regulation( i.e., unless the gas is? deregulated?). Administration and enforcement of the NGPA ceiling prices are delegated to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission(? FERC?). In June 1986, FERC issued Order No. 451, which, in general, is designed to provide a higher NGPA ceiling price for certain vintages of old gas. It is possible that we may in the future acquire significant amounts of natural gas subject to NGPA price regulations and/or FERC Order No. 451. <p> The operations related to the Well Projects are subject to extensive and continually changing regulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under constant review for amendment and expansion. Many departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue and have issued rules and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual participants. The failure to comply with such rules and regulations can result in large penalties. The regulatory burden on this industry could increase our share of operating expenses and, therefore, affect our profitability. However, we do not believe that these regulations will have a significant negative impact on our limited operations with respect to the Well Projects. <p> 8 <p> Employees <p> We have no significant employees other than Georges Paquet, our President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer, Secretary, Treasurer and Director, and Melany Paquet our Vice President and Director. We believe that until such time that we have fully developed our plan of operations we will not have any employees and that we will frequently use consultants to assist in the completion of various projects. <p> WHERE YOU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. <p> We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management 's estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. <p> We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board( United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatements. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company? s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis for our opinion. <p> In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2012 and July 31, 2011 and the related results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended July 31, 2012 and the period from April 6, 2010( inception) through July 31, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. <p> The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred losses from operation since inception. This factor raises substantial doubt about the Company? s ability to continue as a going concern. Management? s plans in regard to this matter are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. <p> /s/ MaloneBailey, LLP <p> www.malone-bailey.com <p> Houston, Texas <p> October 29, 2012 <p> F-2 <p> Future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Balance Sheets <p> ASSETS <p> July 31, <p> 2012 <p> July 31, <p> 2011 <p> Current Assets <p> Cash <p> $ <p> 409,546 <p> $ <p> 11,005 <p> Subscription Receivable <p> 5,000 <p> - <p> Total Current Assets <p> 414,546 <p> 11,005 <p> Oil and gas properties <p> Unproved property <p> 50,000 <p> 50,000 <p> Total Assets <p> $ <p> 464,546 <p> $ <p> 61,005 <p> LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS?

The Company has been in the exploration stage since its formation and has not commenced business operations. The company complies with statements of Financial Accounting Standard ASC 915-15 and the Securities and Exchange Commission Exchange Act 7 for its characterization of the company as an exploration stage company. <p> 2. <p> Going Concern <p> These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies the Company will continue to realize it assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. During the period ended July 31, 2012, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $100,042. The Company is in the business of exploiting and developing natural resources. The Company participates in and invests in development projects with other companies across a wide range of natural resources. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations, and the attainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Company? s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. <p> 3. <p> Summary of Significant Accounting Policies <p> a) <p> Basis of Presentation <p> These financial statements and notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Company? s fiscal year end is July 31. <p> b) <p> Use of Estimates <p> The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States necessarily requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. We regularly evaluate estimates and judgments based on historical experience and other relevant facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. <p> c) <p> Cash and Cash Equivalents <p> The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Oil and Gas Properties <p> The Company applies the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties. Under the successful efforts method, exploration costs such as exploratory geological and geophysical costs, delay rentals and exploration overhead are charged against earnings as incurred. Acquisition costs and costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling the well. If management determines that commercial quantities of hydrocarbons have not been discovered, capitalized costs associated with exploratory wells are charged to exploration expense. Acquisition costs of unproved leaseholds are assessed for impairment during the holding period and transferred to proved oil and gas properties to the extent associated with successful exploration activities. Significant undeveloped leases are assessed individually for impairment, based on the Company? s current exploration plans, and a valuation allowance is provided if impairment is indicated. <p> Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties are calculated using the unit-of-production method. The reserve base used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties. With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account. Our current properties have minimal production and are considered unproved as of July 31, 2011 and July 31, 2012 and as such are not subject to depletion until such time they are further developed and determined to be proved or impaired. <p> The Company reviews its proved properties in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification( ASC) 932-360, Extractive Activities Oil &; Gas, Property, Plant, and Equipment( ASC 360). ASC 360 requires the Company to evaluate property and equipment as an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the property and equipment below the carrying amount. If the carrying amount of property and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the Company would recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the discounted cash flow. Unproved properties are also evaluated under ASC 932-360 periodically by management to determine whether they have been impaired. A property would likely be impaired, for example, if a dry hole has been drilled on it and the entity has no firm plans to continue drilling. Also, the likelihood of partial or total impairment of a property increases as the expiration of the lease term approaches if drilling activity has not commenced on the property or on nearby properties. If the results of the assessment indicate impairment, a loss shall be recognized by providing a valuation allowance. <p> In fiscal year ended July 31, 2012 and 2011 there was no impairment of our oil and gas properties. <p> e) <p> Asset Retirement Obligations <p> In August 2001, the FASB issued ASC 410-20,? Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations?( ASC 410-20). ASC 410-20 requires that the fair value of an asset retirement cost, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of the related long-lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method. <p> f) <p> Impairment of Long-lived Assets <p> In accordance with ASC 360-10, Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount of the fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balance sheet. <p> g) <p> Foreign Currency Translation <p> The financial statements are presented in United States dollars. In accordance with ASC 830? Foreign Currency Translation?, foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated into United States dollars at rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items, including equity, are translated at the historical rate of exchange. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange during the year. During the year ended July 31, 2012, the company had immaterial translation loss due to cash translation which was deemed to be irrelevant. <p> F-8 <p> Future Energy Corp. <p>( An Exploration Stage Company) <p> Notes to the Financial Statements <p> 3. <p> Summary of Significant Accounting Policies( continued) <p> h) <p> Loss per Share <p> The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC 740 " Earnings per Share ". ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share(? EPS?) on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by dividing net income( loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period including stock options, using the treasury stock method, and convertible preferred stock, using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended July 31, 2012 are the same as any incremental common stock equivalent would be anti-dilutive. <p> i) <p> Income Taxes <p> The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the mounts expected to be realized <p> j) <p> Revenue Recognition <p> The Company uses the sales method to account for sales of crude oil and natural gas. Under this method, revenues are recognized based on actual volumes of oil and gas sold to purchasers. The volumes sold may differ from the volumes to which the Company is entitled based on the interest in the properties. These differences create imbalances which are recognized as a liability only when the imbalance exceeds the estimate of remaining reserves. We had no production, limited revenue and no imbalances as of July 31, 2011. Costs associated with production are expensed in the period incurred. <p> k) <p> Recent Accounting Pronouncements <p> We do not expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flow. <p> 4. <p> Oil Well Properties <p> On July 25, 2010, the Company entered into an agreement with an unrelated third party( Tim Cooksey Oil, LLC) to purchase a 1.57% working interest in unproved property located in Franklin County, Illinois for $25,000. <p> On December 17, 2010, the Company purchased a 3% working interest in unproved property located in Franklin County, Illinois for $25,000. <p> F-9 <p> Future Energy Corp. <p>( An Exploration Stage Company) <p> Notes to the Financial Statements <p> 5. <p> Promissory Note?

Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, and in light of the material weaknesses found in our internal controls over financial reporting, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. <p> Management? s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting <p> Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The Company? s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. <p> Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company? s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2012, using the criteria established in? Internal Control - Integrated Framework? issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission( " COSO "). <p> A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company? s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2012, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below. <p> 1. <p> We do not have an Audit Committee? While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management? s view that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an utmost important entity level control over the Company? s financial statement. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee. <p> 2. <p> We did not maintain appropriate cash controls? As of July 31, 2012, the Company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the cash process, including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions, and did not require dual signature on the Company? s bank accounts. Alternatively, the effects of poor cash controls were mitigated by the fact that the Company had limited transactions in their bank accounts. <p> 3. <p> Lack of segregation of duties. We have an inadequate number of personnel to properly implement control procedures. <p> 4. <p> Lack of a formal review process that includes multiple levels of review from adequate personnel with requisite expertise. We do not have a functioning audit committee of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures. <p> 5. <p> We did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31, 2012, the Company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements ; however there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Company? s data or off-site storage of the data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors. <p> 13 <p> Accordingly, the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company? s internal controls. <p> As a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control? Integrated Framework issued by COSO. <p> Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting <p> There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation we conducted of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. <p> This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company? s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
