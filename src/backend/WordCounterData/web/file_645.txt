5091541 <h> Jumping From the Edge of Space <p> Austrian skydiver and daredevil Felix Baumgartner sets out today from Roswell, N.M., to become the first man to break the sound barrier in freefall. He 'll attempt his record-setting supersonic parachute jump by leaping off a helium balloon at 120,000 feet -- the edge of space. That 's three to four times higher than the cruising altitude of the average airliner. <p> He 'll of course be wearing a specially designed pressure suit that will supply oxygen during his ascent and jump. During three minutes of freefall, he could reach up to 690 mph, which at those altitudes will exceed the speed of sound. As the atmosphere density increases, he 'll slow down to conventional descent speeds, deploy his parachute at about 3,000 feet, and land safely in the desert. <p> If he accomplishes this feat, his Red Bull Stratos program will surpass a record set in 1960 by Air Force Col. Joseph Kittinger, who jumped from a balloon at 102,800 feet, but did n't break the sound barrier during his descent. Kittinger 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be 30 million cubic feet and 550 feet tall. It will begin its ascent long and narrow, and as the helium expands at higher altitudes, it will become nearly spherical. His capsule and parachute are both specially designed for this mission, and his equipment -- and body -- will be wired up with sensors to help scientists learn about human response to high-altitude conditions freefalls. <p> I spoke with Baumgartner before his historic stunt to find out how he prepared himself to take that One Giant Leap off his balloon platform. Read below, then check out his mission here : http : **29;5335;TOOLONG <p> MH : How did you prepare for this jump? <p> FB : We did two test jumps this year. The first was 72,000 feet. Everything went really well, and it was a tremendous success. I knew then for sure what I was capable of, and it gave our team a chance to see how all the equipment works prior to our second jump from 96,000 feet. <p> MH : How many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have as many 120 people on the ground at Roswell, including camera personnel and all the support teams. Our core group is about 10 to 15 engineers and technicians. <p> MH : What were the first jumps like? <p> FB : The launch was so exciting -- to be able to finally take off after five years of preparation. Technically, though, everything felt familiar on both the way up and down, because we 'd done our homework so well. The higher I got, I could see the curvature of the earth and the fully black sky above me, and I realized immediately that I was standing in a spot that not a lot of people have been to. I was only the third person to ascend that high in a balloon. I joined a pretty small club. <p> MH : How did you pass the time during the ascent? <p> FB : I was super-busy on the way up. It 's a 90-minute climb, but I had to constantly keep an eye on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I did n't it could be a potential fire hazard. I also spoke with Joe Kittinger a lot -- he 's an advisor on this mission. Every once in a while, of course, I looked out the window and enjoyed the view. That 's the good part! <p> MH : Were you nervous or afraid before the jumps? <p> FB : The way I work all the time is to be as comfortable with the risk as I can be, and confident in our preparation. That 's why there are so many tests and challenges -- the secret to confidence is research, experimentation, and talking to the right people. <p> MH : Were there ever any moments you thought you might back out or have second thoughts? <p> FB : Never. The only showstopper would be an equipment malfunction. I made the decision to do this a long time ago, and never turned around. <p> MH : So what was it like jumping during your test dives? <p> FB : Below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skydive -- you can use the airflow to your advantage to steer and orient your body. But at 120,000 feet you 're nearly in a vacuum. There 's no air resistance, so all your skydiving skills are pretty much useless for the first 20 seconds of the three-minute free-fall. I honestly do n't really know what to expect while jumping from 120,000 feet, in terms of the sound barrier or slowing down. If I ca n't control those first 20 seconds and stay stable, that could mean big trouble farther down. <p> MH : What 's it like working with Col. Kittinger, who 's a legendary figure in aerospace? <p> FB : It 's a great pleasure and a great honor. He was the one who raised his hand in 1960 and said I 'm gon na do this. He 's now 84, and having him in my ear is very helpful from a mental perspective. It helps me to know that he 's down there, because he 's the only one in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a deep fascination with technology -- how it 's created and how people use it.
