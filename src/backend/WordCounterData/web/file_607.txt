5087641 <h> Ready To Take A Chance Again Lyrics <h> Barry Manilow <p> You remind me I live in a shell Safe from the past and doing ' okay but not very well No jolts, no surprises, no crisis arises My life goes along as it should, it 's all very nice but not very good And I 'm ready to take a chance again Ready to put my love on the line with you Been living with nothing to show for it You get what you get when you go for it And I 'm ready to take a chance again with you When she left me in all my despair, I just held on My hopes were all gone, then I found you there And I 'm ready to take a chance again Ready to put my love on the line with you Been living with nothing to show for it You get what you get when you go for it And I 'm ready to take a chance again Ready to put my love on the line with you Been living with nothing to show for it You get what you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a chance again
