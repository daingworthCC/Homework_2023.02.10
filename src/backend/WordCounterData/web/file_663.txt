They built homes for people who did not have any, and picked apples for the hungry. They tutored the young and spruced up the lawns of local nonprofits. <p> " Growing up in the mountains, everybody helped everybody. Neighbors pitched in to help neighbors, " said Ernie Wilson, who has been volunteering with Housing Assistance Corporation since 1991. With days like United Way 's Day of Caring, he said, " we 're getting back to how it used to be. " <p> United Way volunteers, staff and community officials kicked off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Technology Education and Development Center at Blue Ridge Community College.

" <p> More than 29 local companies supported the annual Day of Caring by giving their employees time to volunteer. <p> " We are so thrilled to have such an incredible increase in the number of volunteers serving this year, " said Molly Parkhill, president of Blue Ridge Community College. " People who volunteer know that they are not only improving our community through their service, but often enriching their own lives as well. " <p> For his service project, Wilson worked side-by-side with other volunteers building a ramp and a back deck for a family on Hoke Road. <p> I enjoy doing this, " he said. " It 's great that businesses let their people out for a day to help the community. " <p> Nearly 100 volunteers from several companies and service agencies gathered to pick apples at Alan King 's orchard on Hyder Road Friday morning. The juicy fruit was transferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank " for distribution to those facing hunger in Western North Carolina. <p> " We did this last year and we had a grand time, " said Bridget Barron, nursing director of psychiatric and detox services at Pardee Hospital. She worked with other nursing directors to harvest a tree of its fruit. <p> " This is our first time picking apples for Manna Food Bank, " said Cindy Owen of PSNC Energy.
