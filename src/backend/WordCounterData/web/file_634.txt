5090341 <p> Next -- for those of you who did n't see the news, Mark Shut-tle-worth will also be doing a Keynote at PyCon -- this is awe-some news. I think both keynotes, his and Anto-nio Rodriguez ' will be great. I do n't want to speak as to the con-tent just yet -- but with two high cal-iber entrepreneurs/founders, I 'm dead sure it will be awesome. <p> As for the talks I want to see -- well, this is crim-i-nally dif-fi-cult. I pretty much want to see almost every sin-gle invited talk we have( I 'm espe-cially excited about Alex 's, Jack 's, Joe 's and Ned 's talks. I think our invited speak-ers this year will be very, very popular. <p> " Under-stand-ing the Python GIL " -- David Bea-z-ley ; David 's been hint-ing at tak-ing his talk he did ear-lier this year " up a notch " -- I ca n't wait! <p> " Actors : What, Why, and How " -- Dono-van Pre-ston. Hell yeah! <p> " Tur-tles All The Way Down : Demys-ti-fy-ing Deferreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glyph is a fan-tas-tic, and ener-getic speaker. Def-i-nitely look-ing for-ward to see this dog-and-pony show. <p> " Using Django in Non-Standard Ways " -- Eric Flo-ren-zano ; I 've been doing a fair amount of non-standard Django work lately, and I 'm inter-ested to see things which may apply to my day-to-day work. <p> " Mod-ern ver-sion con-trol : Mer-cu-r-ial inter-nals " -- Dirk-jan Ocht-man and " Hg and Git : Ca n't we all just get along? " -- Mr. Scott Cha-con ; these both apply to a lot of the work I 'm doing( not the day job) and given the adop-tion rate of both mer-cu-r-ial and git, and the fact git con-tin-ues to fill me with a seething rage every time I use it, I des-per-ately need to see Scott 's talk! <p> That 's a quick top five( six) off the top of my head -- and I could prob-a-bly list out a heck of a lot more. I 'm com-pletely jazzed about PyCon this year. We 've added a fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
