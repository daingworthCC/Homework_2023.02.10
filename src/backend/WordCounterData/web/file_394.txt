5066241 <p> Fueling for a long run is a challenge that we all face from time to time. I am not sure there is anything worse than getting out on a long run or ride and starting to feel slower because your blood sugar is dropping. You know the feeling -- your whole body gets tired and you start slowing down and there seems like there is nothing that you can do about it. I rode 60 miles on Saturday and killed the out section, but of course I had to turn around and come home. Miles 55 to 60 were pretty tough because I had not brought enough fuel for three hours. I ate before the ride and thought that I could get by with two bottles instead of three. That small mistake made me push really hard for those last five miles and if I had to run off that ride, it would have been tough. Bonking is not fun. Ever. <p> I did write a basic overview last year of nutrition strategies and how to avoid a bonk, but I want to talk specifically about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When running, the number of calories you burn are dependent on the distance you cover and your weight. Your speed or time have nothing to do with it. Of course, the faster you run the more calories you will burn each hour. Runner 's World has a great calorie calculator on their site( click on the link) that asks you to input your weight and the distance run. Personally, I weigh 185 lbs. right now and according to the calculator, I burn about 140 calories per mile when I run. I use a Garmin Edge 500 and according to my months of tracking the data, I burn a little less than 800 calories per hour when I am biking. If I run my typical 7.1 mph, I am burning just under 1,000 calories per hour when I am on a long run. <p> There is no way that my body could absorb that many calories in an hour to replenish the energy expenditures required for a run or a ride. Every body is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per hour. When I am in the middle of the season, mine can get up to about 300 calories. So that leaves me with a significant deficit. Fueling up before your run or ride is the only way you can hope to get through a workout of two or more hours. There are lots of great ideas out there related to pre and post-workout fueling, and we will talk about those another day. Today I want to review the strategies of the people I know. <p> Eat Up People <p> I swear I have tried about everything during workouts of 3+ hours with varying results. I also have friends who have some interesting strategies to intake their 300 calories per hour during a long workout. <p> George Gel Eater -- This is the person who is usually responsible for the foil packets that line your favorite route. I am sure they have good intentions and want to come back and pick up their garbage after their run or ride, but time just gets away from them. Gels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The challenge that I have with them is they do require water to wash them down and decrease their osmolality( basically its concentration) to a level that will allow them to be absorbed. The problem I faced when I used gels during long workouts was I had a tough time getting the balance of gel to water right. I constantly felt bloated and like the gel was just stuck in my stomach. If you ca n't absorb the calories consumed, then they are doing you no good. That and for a five hour ride I had to take 10 with me. <p> Peter PowerBar -- I have a buddy who tried to fuel most of his long rides with PowerBars. While I love a PowerBar in the middle of a ride, using these as your only source of calories can be dangerous for the same reasons as gels. It is tricky to get the bar to water concentration right. And then what happens if you forget to eat your bar. I personally prefer a ProBar, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consume nutrition every 30 minutes, so opening a ProBar and eating half can be tricky. If you like solid food in your stomach, some type of bar may be the best approach for you. During a run, I do n't love solids, but during a ride I crave them after three hours. The best solution for me is a ProBar. <p> Liquid Mike -- Yeah, I had to make the list. This is my blog and this is certainly a vanity piece. Regardless, I feel using liquid nutrition is the easiest way to consume calories during a long workout. My brain does n't always work at 100% capacity during a long workout, so having my nutrition premade takes the guesswork out of calorie consumption. I mix Infinit with water so that each water bottle contains 275 calories and I target drinking one bottle per hour. I have tried using powdered Gatoraide, HEED, Perpetuem, and just about every other powdered drink out there with various results. I did n't love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jason from the fitness blog Cook, Train, Eat, Race sent me some Herbalife24 Prolong. The Infinit I use and the Prolong both use carbs and protein for their calorie sources and include electrolytes to help in absorption. I am scheduled to test the Herbalife24 Prolong this week on some shorter rides of 30 miles. I have been using Infinit for several years and absolutely trust the quality and results I get out of that product. <p> Freaky Frank -- This is that guy in your circle of friends who tries some of the weirdest things out there. Now, I admit that I have fallen into this category. When I did LOTOJA in 2011 I had cut, boiled, and salted red potatoes that I ate by the pound. That was a 12 hours in the saddle day, so I had to eat something solid. I also made a modified California style roll that had scrambled eggs and ham rolled in rice and Nori. I did n't love the taste of the Nori while riding, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am riding an organized century with my buddies, I really like to raid the sandwich trays and roll lunchmeat and cheese up together and I eat those until I ca n't eat anymore. When we stop at convenience stores to refill on water, I will usually buy a packet of lunchmeat and just eat it plain. For some reason it always sounds good. <p> Why This Discussion Matters <p> I love talking training and the strategies we all use to reach peak performance. I would really like you to leave a comment related to nutrition during your long runs and rides. I think we all have something to contribute to this discussion and I would really appreciate your comments and ideas. There are always beginner triathletes, runners, and cyclists who lurk here, so share your strategies that work and those that do not as well. <h> 14 Comments <p> The thing with bars is that they have to be simple. The ones that are made by pressing 3000 different types of nuts and berries together are just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at when I 'm running. Clif bars may be the exception, but I 'd rather a Powerbar, a gel or a Honey Stinger Waffle. <p> PS -- Really sorry about Levi. I was pulling for Wiggins( I think you knew that) but I was n't pulling for him that much. My wife saw that last cash into the motorcycle and she almost took away my riding privileges. <p> Patrick you are right on about bars. I do like ProBars though and they seem to fit the " 3000 different types of nuts and berries together " category. I swear I have seen Honey Stingers everywhere but I have n't ever tried one. I guess I will have to pick some up this week. <p> The first crash was Levi 's fault. The second he says someone hit his rear wheel and put him down. That third one was just ugly. When the lead out rider started to get funky on the turn, I did n't notice that there was another rider already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crash could have been much uglier too. But I was proud of Levi finishing off the time trial and sticking to it. Then Tejay kept his 5th place overall and 1st place white jersey finishes. <p> But Paris-Nice 2012 belonged to Wiggins. I read an article this morning that quoted him as saying he thinks he can throw down for Tour d'France. Cadel Evans also said this morning his current form is not where it was at this time in 2011. I got ta think we are going to have a four or five man race with Wiggins, Schleck, Voeckler, Kloden, Evans, and perhaps a dark horse like Leipheimer or Sanchez up there in the GC. I think the 2012 Tour is going to be sweet. <p> Great comment Jason. I believe the research that states fueling for your next workout begins as soon as your last one ends. Recovery nutrition is a very important part of fueling up, and I will put up a post related to that. <p> I am pumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The flavor smells pretty subtle, which is good. I do n't love strong flavors when I am running or riding so whatever I use can not be overpowering. I think the main qualifier there is how does it taste when it is warm. <p> I think the underlying message here that I hope others recieve is that everyone is different. I know I need to take in more calories on the run than I do but my stomach also wo n't take much more in than I take. Therefore I am choosy about what calories I take. I do n't have the time on the run to let my body digest complex carbs that might be found in some( not naming names) drinks. I need quick and dirty sugar. So for me, in a half or full Ironman, I seek cola and water at every aid station. HFCS is probably not the greatest thing for a teenager or elementary school age child, but for this Ironman athlete, it 's the top choice! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but again I look for those with the simplest of sugars. The closer the number of sugars to the total number of carbs, the better for me. <p> On the bike I just take whatever is on the course and some of my own gel, unless it 's oncourse too. I 'm not working as hard there and I can accept just about anything although I still stay away from solids. I usually do n't get in enough plain water to digest a Powerbar. I think plain water is my biggest issue on both run and bike. I just do n't get enough. <p> So keep experimeting and hopefully you can find your cocktail of choice. <p> For Ironman St. George I started on Coke at the mile 15 aid station and it was like someone used an AED on me. That HFCS was amazing and man all my body wanted was more, more, more. Then during LOTOJA 2011, I actually planned to use Coke starting at Hoback Junction. I had a 1 liter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could, and then filled up a water bottle with it for the rest of the ride. When your blood sugar is super low, there is nothing like the thick syrupy goodness of a little Coke. <p> You will be there soon enough. I swear you take in 275 calories per hour and drink a bottle of water each hour, you will be fine. You could probably start a new fad by using Snickers as your fuel source. <p> I have to admit that I am one of those " gel " users as well as the " chomps ". On longer bike rides, I love to bring a bag full of pretzels. If it 's not to blazing hot, I 've been known to bring Tootsie Rolls for that sugar buzz! <p> Gel is n't a problem as long as you do n't leave your packages behind, which I am sure you do n't Diana. I think I just saw an ad with Mirinda Carfrae saying that he favorite post workout beverage was none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good company Diana! <p> Yes everyone is different! I have a very sensitive stomach especially to things high in sugar which makes it interesting to try and figure out my nutrition. It can be scary too I had a friend that ran out of fuel and bonked on a long ride and had to hitch a ride back to our car. <p> There are two types of endurance athletes in my book Natasha -- those who have bonked and those who will sometime in the future. It is just one of those facts of life that happens to everyone. I would say your friend was lucky that they were able to hitch a ride back to the cars. I would have had to make the " Call of Shame ". <p> My journey into triathlon started simple enough -- when I was eight I would run outside, bike to the city pool, and swim all afternoon each summer. I would spend so much time at the pool that I would go through multiple ear infections. Once I became @ @ @ @ @ @
