5071341 <p> Deal and Coupon sites have garnered a lot of attention this year. Groupon, the most popular of them, has been in the news plenty due to rumors about Google showing an interest for them. Is there any chance for you as a developer to get access to huge dataset of deals and coupons, possibly containing Groupon deals to and offer it to users of your application? 8coupons.com definitely thinks so and it has launched the 8coupons API for exactly that purpose. <p> 8coupons aggregates 186 daily deal sites in the US and is offering all of that to developers to integrate into their apps and offer them in return to their users.
