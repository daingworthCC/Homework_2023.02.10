Xbox users can access and participate in this interactive television experience directly through the Xbox LIVE dashboard. This will be the first of four debates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream live through the Election 2012 Hub on Xbox LIVE. As a bonus, Xbox LIVE users who watch three of the four debates will be awarded with a Halo 4 Warrior Armor avatar. <p> pretty weak that it requires gold... because, you know, even people who do n't spend $60/year playing video games online should probably have informed opinions on who they want to become PotUS <p> http : **35;2944;TOOLONG... Dane Miller <p> because they cant watch it on every channel that is broadcasted over the air for free. <p> http : **35;2981;TOOLONG... Dane Miller <p> Garry Johnson should have been included in the debates. The only reason he was n't is because he would make the other two look like bumbling idiots. <p> http : **25;3018;TOOLONG? <p> He had a chance to make Romney look like an idiot in the Republican Debates... He failed to do so. Johnson had his chance, he lost. <p> http : **35;3045;TOOLONG... Dane Miller <p> IMHO he did make Romney look like an idiot, in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Romney. he just does n't have the backing of Coke, and Fannie May and Freddie Mac. It 's obvious the Republican party had chose their nominee well before the primary debates even started... <p> http : **26;3082;TOOLONG Ezra Ramos <p> If MS cares so much about the election thier they should release Halo 4 the week after the election not on election day. <p> saxwriter1 <p> is there a way to log in more than 1 person at a time so my family does nt get cheated out of the avatar award. <p> theConstruct <p> You can if you have multiple controllers. <p> http : **35;3110;TOOLONG... Cyclops <p> Is there a screen shot of the avatar somewhere? <p> http : **34;3147;TOOLONG Andrew Guentert <p> Am I missing something or just not looking in the right place? There is no Election Hub or anything about the election on my xbox dashboard. Nothing has changed on it since i got updated for the public beta a few weeks ago, well ad wise the same 3 ads. <p> i 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me, it 's under the Home tab, it says " 9 PM ET : Join the Debate, We 're Polling LIVE " when you click it, it 'll re-download the player <p> Russell Gorall <p> Why did you capitalize " beta testers "? <p> Logic Squirrel <p> So the only voters are gold members this year? I suspect this is a Romney thing lmao <p> shinji <p> I think it is a perk for gold members... <p> BostonSup <p> The 47% without Gold can watch it through the free network channels since they wo n't spend $60/year like the rest of us! What freeloaders. <p> DTruth316 <p> #occupyxboxlivegold <p> Russell Gorall <p> Sounds logical. <p> theConstruct <p> How do we get to there is we have the beta dashboard? <p> shinji <p> As someone else already mentioned it is in the TV section but I have yet to verify. I 'm getting the latest update as we speak( it has n't been turned on for a while as I 've been busy). <p> http : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 out of every 48 months debating about a President and then wonders why they are in the hole. <p> BostonSup <p> Because America is the only country in the hole? Unless you are German, I am pretty sure your country like most of the world is also in the hole... <p> shinji <p> If you are on the beta and still looking for this it is on the main screen.

A. Any Xbox LIVE Rewards member in the United States who watches 3 out of the 4 presidential and / or vice presidential debates on Election 2012 on Xbox LIVE for 30 minutes or more each will receive a Halo 4 Warrior Armor for their Avatar. <p> Maybe if you are n't an xbox rewards member you have to watch the full debate. <p> http : **30;3245;TOOLONG? id=7...
