5055741 <p> " Hypnotic layered melodies, haunting songs, rich metaphors -- you could describe a lot of indie rock bands with these words, including San Francisco 's Grass Widow, but what really matters is if the band uses these characteristics to create songs that are actually good. Where Grass Widow stands out is in their tendency to strip back. A tambourine, some snare drum, a few double tracked guitars and the heavily harmonized vocals of all three members, Hannah Lew, Raven Mahon, and Lillian Maring, are all that Grass Widow need to transmit their post-punk infused personal narratives. The band released a self titled record in 2009, followed by a few EPs and 2010 's Past Time. This week the trio released their latest record, Internal Logic( you can stream it for free at Stereogum.com), which uses minimalism as a foundation for psychedelic, guitar based surf rock tunes perfect for a day by the pool baking in the sun.
