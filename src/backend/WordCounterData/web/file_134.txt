5039941 <h> Reviews <p> Appearance -- This one has a dark orange color from the caramel malts that offset the hops and heat of the habanero The head seem to suffer due to the oil of the pepper. <p> Smell -- A sweet malt smell with some citrus and pine hops and a hint of heat. <p> Taste - A good balance of hops and malt. The habanero adds just a little heat on the end. The heat lingers until the alcohol of the next sip cleans the palate and the cycle starts all over once again. <p> Mouthfeel -- This one is pretty much a straight up IPA. A little body but nothing you have to chew. <p> Overall -- A nice off side road off the standard IPA. This was the winner of the 2nd annual Bell 's Homebrew competition. It was a good beer. I can not wait until the winner of the next competition is on tap. <p> Burnt orange in color with a thin film of a head gentile carbonation. Smell is a bit dull but a citrusy hop and there is zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The taste is of a good ipa that is well balances and akin to two hearted it. There is still not even a hit of habinaro really untill the finish and when it does come through it lingers on the back of your tounge, delicious hot peppers. The mouth feel is light, sticky and crisp especially for a 7% beer. It definatly has some hanging power to stick around on
