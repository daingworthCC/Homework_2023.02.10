5048441 <p> Thanks to Joshua Keating, posting over at Foreign Policy, we learn what Romney really, truly thinks of his current hosts( h/t Atrios) : <p> England sic is just a small island. Its roads and houses are small. With few exceptions, it does n't make things that people in the rest of the world want to buy. And if it had n't been separated from the continent by water, it almost certainly would have been lost to Hitler 's ambitions. Yet only two lifetimes ago, Britain ruled the largest and wealthiest empire in the history of humankind. Britain controlled a quarter of the earth 's land and a quarter of the earth 's population. <p> That 's from his increasingly ironically titled book, No Apology. <p> Well,( a) : <p> Suck. On. This. Mr. Mitt : <p> Top that with some steroidally swollen MacMansion in Malibu La Jolla, you unctuous, climbing, nouveau slime-doggy* <p> And( b) : Mitt should n't worry about apologizing for America to foreigners ; if what we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll have a months-long( at least) backlog of personal sorries to deliver by next Tuesday. <p> This entry was posted on Thursday, July 26th, 2012 at 3:36 pm and is responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed. Both comments and pings are currently closed. <p> This is pure genius from the Mittster 's campaign : Mitt goes overseas and trashes America 's reputation ; the Obama Administration then comes out and says something like " Hey Europe, all Americans are n't this idiotic " ; the Romney campaign goes ballistic over how " there you go again " Obama is apologizing for America when Mitt knows America is too exceptional to ever apologize for, even when he tactlessly insults a foreign nation he 's visiting. Brilliant! Fox News will be all over it! <p> Sweet Jesus, somoebody wan na remind Romney of a little thing called the Blitz, where London was bombed almost nightly? Right, that mightly Channel was all that kept the Nazi 's from marching into Picadilly. Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Man, I 'm getting all indignant on the Brit 's behalf! <p> Well, given that modern wingtards talk a lot about Adam Smith, but have clearly never bothered to crack open the tomes, it 's not surprising that they do n't know of the British contribution to the study of economics. <p> Well, if you want to be really detailed, the Scottish contribution, but hey, UK 1701 and all that rot. <p> Well, given that modern wingtards talk a lot about Adam Smith, but have clearly never bothered to crack open the tomes, it 's not surprising that they do n't know of the British contribution to the study of economics. <p> Well, if you want to be really detailed, the Scottish contribution, but hey, UK 1701 and all that rot. <p> Given that the 13 North American colonies departed from the Empire, through violence, in the latter half of the 18th century, before the Empire reached its zenith, it would appear that some did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Still, the Rmoneytron 's brilliant public relations coup today in the UK was clearly forseen by him two years ago. <p> @ Feebog : I fully expect Bishop Romney to make some form of offensive statement that will make the religious crazies there erupt in even more craziness. Also, Netanyahu and Adelson might not have a problem with the posthumous baptism of Holocaust victims and other Jews, but other people feel very strongly about the issue. <p> Top that with some steroidally swollen MacMansion in Malibu, you unctuous, climbing, nouveau slime-doggy <p> If you read contemporary accounts -- especially Jonathan Swift 's -- there 's some funny stuff written about the spiralling cost of Blenheim Palace, because a grateful nation basically gave it to John Churchill without setting a limit on the total bill. It 's a monument to a pretty huge ego ; of Vanburgh 's great houses, Castle Howard 's much prettier. <p> Now everyone knows how us Bay Staters feel about that asshole. He started shit talking us half way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Republican buddies. It only took Londoners one day to figure it out. <p> The narrative of Mitt Romney as a clueless and out of touch elitist businessman with no skills at handling the most important topics that would face a president is no stereotype ; it is reality. Romney has already destroyed his only major foreign trip as presidential candidate, deeply and cruelly insulting our closest allies in the entire world with a thoughtless and baseless remark. An election of Romney to the White House could very well lead us into another conflict with England, because why would he tone down his arrogant rhetoric when he truly does n't think he 's said anything wrong? Romney is a bumbling and dangerous neophyte on the world stage. <p> Yet only two lifetimes ago, Britain ruled the largest and wealthiest empire in the history of humankind. Britain controlled a quarter of the earth 's land and a quarter of the earth 's population <p> I have to assume this was to set up a bit about how their superior culture/institutions allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. We should, obviously, emulate this( by having low low taxes on rich people) and since we 're already awesomer... well... great country or Greatest Country? Amirite? <p> The Geiger counter of Olympo-mania is going to go zoink! off the scale! People are coming from around the world, and they 're seeing us, and they 're seeing the greatest country on Earth, are n't they? There are some people who are coming from around the world who do n't yet know about all the preparations we 've done to get London ready in the last seven years. I hear there 's a guy called Mitt Romney who wants to know whether we 're ready. Are we ready?( crowd goes wild) <p> I retract the secret service code name Clark Griswald rumor. The problem is that any possible comparison to any comparable bumblers that I can think of runs into the " but they have human qualities " problem. <p> " At Downing Street : ' Looking out through No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know before you " look out of the backside of 10 Downing Street ", as Mitt Romney did on Thursday. <p> Firstly, in Britain, " backside " means " ass ". As in the part of the body. Secondly, " 10 Downing Street " is often used in political reporting as a synonym for a press spokesman for the prime minister, in the same way as " the White House " can say things or have opinions. <p> @ the Conster : There are far more Obama than Romney stickers on the cars I 've seen in northern NH at least. Here in VT I am waiting patiently for my Republican neighbors to put a Romney sign up as they 've done for every other GOP candidate in the past but so far nothing. Other Republicans around here are still stubbornly clinging to their Ron Paul lawn signs ; I have a hunch these people probably wo n't be won over by Ann Romney 's dancing horse. <p> These are n't gaffes, they 're put-downs, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of going to a city hosting the Olympic games without weighing in critically. <p> That 's why he went there. So he could bring up his role in managing the Olympics. I think he, his campaign advisors and pundits are wrong about the importance of his managing an Olympics anyway. They 've so over-sold it that it now seems almost comical. Too, they 're RIGHT about London versus Salt Lake City. It WAS easier in Salt Lake City. <p> in a way romney is right. forget that he is a politician, just think about how england was able to conquer the world by being bigger scumbags than anyone else. no one wants to admit it, and romney is being flamed for alluding to it, but on a scumbag to scumbag level, romney is trying to relate. <p> speaking of, i was trying to read some science articles. man you can really tell that science journalism is the autistic redheaded stepchild of the recognized university discipline panoply. its like how the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the noble ranks. <p> seriously, with science journalism in the utterly incapable hands of smallpeter principled stewardship, is there any doubt why the forces of ignorance, superstition, and organized chicanery rule our public policy anywhere scientific understanding might provide a needed bulwark? <p> I 'm wondering how our intrepid US press is coping with Mitt giving them the cold shoulder while watching the UK press properly rip Mitt to shreds in just one day that they couldn't/would n't do in over a year. <p> These are n't gaffes, they 're put-downs, and Romney does this constantly. <p> He does n't realize how his put downs are annihilating the minuscule Q rating he already had. <p> I 'm convinced the AI can not help it, his staff is slowly going insane, knowing that the are part of a team that is losing and the nomination is n't actually his yet. He 's still presumptive at this point. <p> I 'd be surprised if he had anyone on his team who was that critical of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a man that surrounds himself with advisers who give him advice he does n't want to hear. He 's shown himself to be the guy who surrounds himself with people who think like he does and will say " YES " when he wants them to say yes. <p> They probably really do think he 's doing an awesome job. I 'll bet they have properly tweaked poll numbers based on their projections for turnout that prove he 's scoring big points everywhere he goes and that Obama 's campaign team is being left in the dust. <p> Shh! We have secretly replaced the Republican nominee with a robot made of sand and ground glass. Let 's see whether the American electorate can tell the difference! -- - Tag : Romney 's worse than Sarah Palin. <p> " My fellow Americans. As a young boy, I dreamed of being a baseball ; but tonight I say, we must move forward, not backward ; upward, not forward ; and always twirling, twirling, twirling towards freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white trash ex-Massachusetts fucktards who are tribally Republican. The northern tier of New England is way more independent -- they appreciate the services they get and are into community, and are n't angry haters as a rule. I do n't think anyone in New England who was awake during Romney 's tenure in Massachusetts could name a single reason to cheer for him. <p> The US surrogates have been saying that foreign press coverage does n't matter, which is rich, considering that the intent was clearly to show Rmoney looking comfortable alongside foreign leaders, and the travelling US press has been shut out. As others have said, let 's see whether the US press shies away from acts of journalism. <p> White House Spokesman Jay Carney said, " In keeping with our special relationship, the president also made it clear that he has the utmost confidence in our close friend and ally, the United Kingdom, as they finalize preparations to host the London Olympics. " <p> I keep reading this as a quote from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @?) which makes it doubleplus amusing. Also, what is it with Republicans naming their sons with one-syllable common nouns that start with T? <p> @ NonyNony : Your point is well taken, but they do capable of realizing when optics are bad, explaining Rafalca 's hooves sticking out from under that double-decker, looking much like when Dorothy and her house dropped in on the wicked witch <p> @ Roger Moore : The British gave us common law, including judges to interpret the law and juries to determine guilt or innocence. The latter, despite many shortcomings, is a vital( and much underappreciated) bulwark against tyranny, especially when jurors know and exercise their powers. -- - Tag : Romney 's worse than Sarah Palin. <p> " We attempted to reach Mr. Romney 's campaign managers for their comments on their candidate 's first day abroad. However, the person who answered the phone was inebriated to the point of incoherence, and from what we could gather from his slurred remarks, he was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that point. " <p> Well, the Channel was what kept the Nazis out of London -- after the BEF was sent reeling into Dunkirk, the Wehrmacht were the undisputed masters of Europe. They 'd broken the French and British armies combined. If there had been a land connection between the UK and Europe, they 'd have been all over it. <p> Of course, it was n't JUST the Channel -- it was the ships and aircraft protecting it. They fought and died to ensure the Germans could n't control that stretch of water, and if Germany had been a bit smarter, they might well have lost. <p> Much as I loathe the bastard, I 'd have to rate Romney 's comment " And if it had n't been separated from the continent by water, it almost certainly would have been lost to Hitler 's ambitions " as accurate. <p> Much as I loathe the bastard, I 'd have to rate Romney 's comment " And if it had n't been separated from the continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hitler 's ambitions " as accurate. <p> Nah. It 's counterfactual horseshit. If Britain had been a continental power it would have had( a) a wholly different history and( b) even if you could somehow have created a distinctly British lump on the western edge of the continent it would have had a very different military than the one that confronted Hitler in France in 1940. Who knows when/whether anything like the military engagement that took place in reality could have occurred if Germany faced two France-scale land armies on its western front. <p> If my dog were a dove it could fly. But that ai n't the point, in n it? <p> I rate Mitt 's remark as obtuse -- and incapable of being either accurate or inaccurate. <p> @ schrodinger 's cat : It gives me pause to think that McCain may well have had actual reasons for picking Palin -- given what he had to choose from. More than that, actually, it scares silly to think that this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dave and Boris put up with daily from British comedians, journalists, and their opponents( all three of which can be far more savage than their American counterparts, barring all the ' the president is near ' stuff) weak shit like Romney 's been putting up is going to get knocked down pretty fast. Especially when it comes from an ignorant colonial chav like Romney. <p> If you want to see how robust British insulting gets compare the daily show to mock the week or some of the other news comedy shows. <p> @ slightlypeeved : Archaeologist here. you are wrong. The channel, as such, really only gained the prominence it has now in the modern era after Britain lost its continental holdings. Southern England was pretty much constantly in contact with Brittany and Nord pas de Calais/Belgium to the point that THEY WERE THE SAME COUNTRY into the early modern period and show few if any material cultural distinctions. <p> Northern and western Britain are a different story. To all intents, northern and western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern era( and if you ask the Scots, the Welsh
