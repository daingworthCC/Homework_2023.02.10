5029141 <h> Starting here. Starting now. <p> This little website grew out of concern that pink bathrooms are being ripped out of 40s 50s and 60s homes way too hastily. The reality is : Pink bathrooms are a wonderful part of our home design heritage. And there is no doubt in our minds whatsoever that they are poised for a comeback -- starting here, starting now. Read more. <h> The post that started it all <h> Take the Pledge Today <p> " I hereby pledge to prevent the pulverization of period perfect pink potties and to persevere over pressure to part with my practical pedestal where my pint size prince and princess piddle... I Promise! " -- Lou. <h> More Pink Patriots <h>. <p> Save the Pink Bathrooms Our goal : A gazillion people pledged to preserve vintage pink bathrooms. Maybe you have a pink bathroom. Or you just love them. All are welcome. Your Comment is your Pledge... and while you 're there, share your pink reveries. <p> I pledge to help Save the Pink Bathrooms? Pink bathrooms :( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink light reflecting off your skin,( 2) Speak to an era when we were eager and willing to take more design chances and have fun with color, and( 3) because they almost always fit with the house they are in. If I had a vintage pink bathroom, I would surely treasure it! <p> Sara on July 13th, 2008 2:13 pm <p> I just bought into a house with a pink bathroom( a huge selling point for us!). The previous owners partly renovated it, although they left the pink sink, toilet and tub! I ca n't wait to retro-renovate, and return my pink bathroom to it 's former glory! <p> Femme1 on July 13th, 2008 2:30 pm <p> I pledge to honor and respect the pink bathroom. Unfortunately, I am not the owner of such( I wish!), but my mother has a lovely one with blue-flowered trim tile. It fits perfectly in her 1950s ranch. <p> I think " Save the Pink Bathrooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of HGTV. Let 's deluge those home-renovation gurus that tell everyone to tear out those pink beauties( and blue and aqua and mint green and gold-speckled lovelies) and replace them with faux-Italian tumbled stone. I want them to stand back and realize that colors and styles have their day, and that even their precious granite will look outdated in a few years. Of course, what 's in style is what keeps the U.S. consumerism machine grinding on, in interior design as well as clothing. <p> So please, take a step back from what you think is in style today and what the house magazines and TV shows are telling you is in style, and take a good look at your pink bathroom. Think for yourself. It 's probably petite( as were most bathrooms built in this era) and nicely designed, with interesting details and contrasting trim. Your sink and tub probably have cool geometric details, and you might be lucky enough to have the original space-age looking faucets. Think about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said, even look better in the mirror. And thank your lucky stars that you are the lucky owner of a vintage pink bathroom! <p> Catherine on July 13th, 2008 2:52 pm <p> I love all the pictures, very inspiring to those trying to embrace their own pink treasures. I hope to do mine justice! <p> I pledge. If I ever remodel my bathroom again I pledge to go retro pink and hunt near and far to save the pink from certain doom. <p> Stephen Bauer on July 13th, 2008 3:05 pm <p> I 'm in! I have a great appreciation for those old " pink bathrooms ". I had a pink and black bathroom in my house in Kansas which also sported a turquoise and black kitchen with a beautiful pink Frigidaire with a soft mint green interior! I also had a chance years ago to buy a 1956(?) Airfloat Travel Trailer that was built by MGM for Elizabeth Taylor for location work. It had a beautiful birch interior with rose colored features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling it lived in it and smoked himself into a case of Emphysema and was going to sell it and move to Palm Springs. He decided to take the trailer with him... Anyway that 's the sad account of how I lost Elizabeth Taylor 's Trailer, and a pink bathroom as well! Alas!! <p> I believe it 's a cardinal sin to destroy pink bathrooms! I have one now and I pledge to do all I can to save them wherever they are found... Pink bathrooms, the endangered species of home renovation -- LET 'S MAKE T-SHIRTS! <p> I think granite is a sin! Someday in the distant future I will perhaps be able to buy a house and save a pink bathroom, but until that day all I can do is spread the good word. I 'll put up a link on my blog shortly. Keep up the good fight! <p> Thanks for using the widget on your blog, Andrea!!! -- Pam <p> Anita on July 13th, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1985 was in Lakewood, WA -- it was a 1940-something ranch style and it was amazing. The main bathroom was green and pink tiles. Some of the tiles on the floor had been broken, and I was young without the extra $$ to get the floor fixed appropriately, so I just left them. The tub &; other fixtures were pink and it had this amazing counter space to sit down and primp/put on makeup. I wish I had photos of it but I do n't. The house I grew up in was in South San Francisco and had( I think still has) yellow and green tiles in the bathroom. Very art deco, very cool. I would never consider ripping out a beautiful vintage bathroom. The house I live in now we purchased from a model new -- but I tried to get as much of the art deco &; mid-century feel to it that I could with the limited options, so my master bath has the white tiles with the black bullnose trim. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to get some great art deco light fixtures for the room though. I 'm with you -- save the pink bathrooms( and green, and yellow, etc etc etc)!!!!!! Anita <p> Of course I 'm on board. Unfortunately, my efforts to create an authentic 1950s pink bathroom failed when I was unable to find a matching set of truly PINK fixtures, so I had to go for 1950s blue instead. Thanks to all of those HGTV desecrators, most of the pink pieces are now only a memory. I wonder... can we be genrous and include saving colored 1950s bathrooms of all kinds? Blue, yellow, gold, black........ <p> Hi. I hope I am considered a charter member of Save the Pink Bathrooms, since my pink half-bath was featured on Dec. 29, 2007 on retrorenovation.com! I did get rid of the blah lavender-gray paint on the upper walls by painting them white, but, I still have n't attempted wallpaper. I suspect 50sPam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the message to take care of that oversight! <p> Thanks, Pam, for another creative and inspiring effort! <p>( Exclamation points are a given when it comes to discussing pink bathrooms -- as you can tell from this post and previous ones!) <p> Kitschy Kimberly on July 14th, 2008 6:49 am <p> Great site Pam! I have a pink bathroom and would n't change it ever. Samantha, thanks for the link! That is a smashing pink bathroom that was featured. <p> I hereby pledge to preserve the pink bathroom in our 1956 Doelger home in the Westlake division of Daly City, California. <p> In 2006, my partner and I decided to relocate from Washington, DC, to the San Francisco Bay Area, where he 'd grown up. His parents had been renting out the home in which he 'd lived from birth through age 8, and it had recently become vacant, so they offered it to us. Though I 'd been to San Francisco many times, I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen the house until one month before our move. I was a little worried about it, since I had no idea what to expect. <p> Imagine my great surprise, then, to discover that the house is part of a classic mid-century development, Westlake( the inspiration for Malvina Reynolds ' " Little Boxes "), and that it was in near original condition( so many of the homes in the area, while maintaining their original eclectic facades and exterior charm, were renovated in the 70s to my horror and despair, as we 've seen when hitting open homes) : original metal cabinets with chrome fixtures, yellow tile with chrome accents in the kitchen, original fold-down ironing board and cosmetic cabinet in the kitchen, original dark wood paneling and flagcrete fireplace, original parquet floors, and original pink tile with chrome accents in the bathroom( the sink and original toilet seat were replaced at some point, but we intend to address this). I love the house, and we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessories. <p> I pledge to preserve the pink bathroom! We are scraping the paint of the wonderful pink tiles in one of our bathrooms. The paint is a real pain to get off but thank god they just painted over them and did n't do anything drastic like tear them out. <p> klez56 on July 15th, 2008 6:00 pm <p> I closed on a 1956 ranch yesterday. While inspecting one of the bathrooms I noticed that the shower did n't really have white tile but had been painted over. After much scraping I found pink wall tiles with pink mosaic on the base of the shower. The other part of the bathroom had the wall tiles removed along with the sink and counter top. The vanity used to be pink but was also painted over. I pledge to keep whatever pink I can successfully uncover! <p> Shawna on July 15th, 2008 7:29 pm <p> I pledge to be an advocate and ally to the endangered pink bathroom, and any other mid-century bathroom color at risk of extinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turquoise. We do not possess one of these colorful characters ; however, I additionally pledge to do no harm to the white tile and custom-built birch cabinetry found in our home 's bathrooms. I can hear our 1958 home quietly sobbing whenever we watch HGTV gut one its friends. <p> LawMom on July 16th, 2008 3:24 am <p> When we purchased our home in 1997( the 1st time... funny story) a woman at the open house said, " The first thing I 'd do is rip out that horrid peach and black tile. " We knew then that we 'd have to buy the house and save the bathroom. <p> wandab on July 16th, 2008 3:34 am <p> I take the pledge! one pink bathroom at a time. starting with my own. <p> Chriss on July 16th, 2008 5:53 am <p> Ok. I do n't have a pink bathroom to save but you have my upmost support! Although I do take exception to the fact that this is " pinkcentric ". @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathrooms? What about the black and white bathrooms? What about the seafoam green bathrooms? Are these not being destroyed for the sake of granite tile as well? <p> Anyway, I used to live in a great 1650 sq. ft. apartment in University City( St. Louis) that had two... count them, TWO pink bathrooms! One was pink and seafoam, the other was pink and... wait for it.... maroon( eegad). I loved this place. I miss this place. Sigh... <p> Also I found this neat YouTube vid via a link on LottaLiving.com. It 's a beautiful 50? s house in New Orleans that was saved from destruction only one hour before the wrecking ball was to swing. About halfway through the vid you will see the amazing pink bathroom that was saved as well! <p> I have a pink bathroom that will be saved! My husband and I just bought our adorable 1954 contemporary ranch two months ago, and we are lucky enough to have many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grey). The former owners tried to cover up or " contemporize " over the mid-centrury charm of the house, but we are bringing it back! <p> genjenn on July 16th, 2008 11:48 pm <p> I saved my pink bathroom! I bought my 1951 house in 2001. It was in sad condition after years of being a rental and surviving a series of cheap and stunningly talentless DIY owners. All that remained of the original pink bathroom was the remarkably pristine box shower and separate white tub. It took a lot of research, patience and B &W; tile( they manufactured the original tile so the pinks matched exactly!), but I am now the delighted owner of a fully restored 1950? s Pink Bathroom. I could n't be happier. Call me crazy, but I swear the house is too. <p> Incidentally -- My neighbors love the pink and are kicking themselves for ripping out their yellow, dusty lavender, blue and yes, pink tiled bathrooms. <p> evidentress on July 17th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but I lend you my full support! I feel the need for a full-fledged " Save the Vintage Bathroom " campaign!! My personal fave is aqua, but let 's not forget about the yellows and even the avocado ones. This is a part of our architectural heritage and they ca n't be lost to weekend warriors and flippers!!! <p> KC on July 17th, 2008 7:03 pm <p> I had a pink bathroom -- and a pink kitchen. They were charming and wonderful. I miss them dearly. <p> What I really wanted to draw your attention to, though, is not my post so much as the quote I found of what I think is the most amazing description of a pink bathroom in all of English literature, from A. S. Byatt 's novel " Possession " : <p> " The bathroom was a long narrow rectangle, space saving, coloured like sugared almonds. The fitments were a strong pink, tinged with a dusky greyish tone. The tiled floor was a greyish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were of Italian design -- on certain tiles, not all.These tiles extended halfway up the walls, where they met a paisley vinyl paper crawling with busy suckered globules, octopods, sea-slugs, in very bright purple and pink. There were toning ceramic fitments, in dusty pink pottery, a lavatory-paper holder, a tissue holder, a toothmug on a plate like those huge African lip-decorations, a scallop-shell holding pristine ovoids of purple and pink soap. The slatted, wipe-clean vinyl blinds represented a pink dawn with rose-tinged bulbous cumuli. The candlewick bath-mat, with its hide-like rubber backing, was lavender-coloured and so was the candlewick crescent snugly clutching the lavatory pedestal and the lavatory lid. On the top of this, alert for house-sounds, and urgently concentrating, perched Professor Mortimer P. Cropper. It was 3:00 A.M. " <p> I think that description is hysterically funny and wonderful, and you being a lover of pink bathrooms, I hope you like it too! <p> Peril on July 18th, 2008 5:23 am <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2003 my sister and husband #4 had removed the classic plastic tile around tub. Still have pink tub, black formica, custom mahogany chevron designed cabinet and found a pink iron sink to replace pink steel one that was chipped. I love the inspiration I get from pictures and comments on this sight. I am dedicated to the pink/black 50? s bathroom. <p> pd on July 18th, 2008 8:32 pm <p> I pledge to save and love pink bathrooms! Oh how I envy those who actually have one... <p> Cindy on July 18th, 2008 11:54 pm <p> A pink bathroom? Ooooooo la la! I have never had one but after looking at the photos on retrorenovation my dreams are of pink tiles, sheet vinyl flooring, groovy fixtures...... so I have a pink bathroom in my mind and pledge to keep it just as it is. If I 'm ever lucky enough to have a real one, pink it will stay! <p> I pledge to do anything I can to save the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to own one, boy will it STAY pink! <p> Julie Christine on July 26th, 2008 5:32 pm <p> THINK PINK! <p> I was blessed to find a late 1962 model home in good condition. Bathroom #1 broke my heart at first sight : a pink sink, a pink tub, and pink and white ceramic tiles all around, all of these in perfect condition. The bathroom needed only repainting. I chose Sherwin Williams bright white in eggshell finish for the walls with hi-gloss finish for the cabinets, door, and trim. This bathroom looks lovely with a pink and white floral cotton shower curtain, pink rhinestone curtain rings, and a matching rug all by Shabby Chic. I also purchased three pink towel sets. <p> I have spent the past 2.5 years restoring the house. I am now in the process of restoring the second bathroom. It was originally a half bath. There was an adjacent utility closet, and I thought that it looked big enough for a bathtub. I searched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 60s porcelain blue tub resting in a warehouse in its original shipping crate, and still wearing the factory sticker. It has been installed, and I am thrilled with it! I am now in the process of looking for the ceramic tiles for the walls. <p> Pink is my favorite color. When I walked into this house and saw the pink bathroom my heart said This Is Your House! My little girls take bubblebaths in the pink bathtub. This is my dream come true. <p> Di Di on July 29th, 2008 5:09 am <p> I came across your website a few months ago as we began our pink bath renovation. I am proud and pleased to say that we have painstakingly preserved all that is pink while updating and enhancing non-functioning elements of the bath thanks to B &W; tile selections. We have a few finishing touches to add and then will post our results. Your 32 page photodocumentation of the pink baths is true artistry. Good, bad, beautiful, ugly, timestopping, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Thank you for the view. <p> Di Di <p> Heidi on August 7th, 2008 2:31 am <p> We bought a 1956 ranch house in Las Vegas two years ago with a wonderful pink and chocolate brown bathroom. When the pink toilet in it passed away we searched until we found a new pink toilet( from Kohler) so we could keep it pink! Our plan is to put in pink VCT flooring if we can find it. We still have a long way to go in our restoration project but we are so happy to have our lovely pink and brown bathroom. <p> Now we are investing in a second mid-century modern house just a block away. I was excited to see that the master bath has pink tile in the shower and a pink marble countertop and backsplash. We will be keeping that bathroom as pink as possible, too! <p> Just enjoyed reading about all the pink bathrooms. My home has 6 bathrooms and TWO are pink, the front powder room and the one I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tile is in perfect condition as in the old days they did it right-in cement. Everything is original and my fixtures are Crane so I have stocked up on the inner parts so that I can keep them forever. Two of the other bathrooms are blue, one with a deeper blue trim and the other with maroon. Believe me, they are so beautiful. My kitchen tile is a soft yellow trimmed in blue. Then there is one bathroom which is yellow( with mint green trim) and the last and smallest bathroom is a half bath with blue tile but the toilet is just plain white. When it wears out, I need to change that one! MJ <p> VeryVintageVegas.com pledges to educate and re-train the hords of upcoming buyers who are about to discover the treasure trove of pink bathrooms of all colors that are so abundant in Vintage Vegas. <p> http : **26;10564;TOOLONG is committed to the preservation of all classic homes and historic neighborhoods of Las Vegas.

My sweetie and i purchased a 1956 brick ranch almost two years ago, and the pink bathroom was a MAJOR selling point. We are very lucky, cosmetically the bathroom is in wonderful shape, and we are comitted to keeping the pretty pink-ness of it! <p> I am taking the pledge. I moved into a 1969 condo. The bathroom floor tiles are dark pink, light pink, and white ; and the shower tiles are light pink. I have just put in a special order for a light pink/dark pink/gray marble sink. <p> Additionally I am doing the kitchen in a black/white/red 50s style and need cheap but cool cabinet and drawer hardware. Help? <p> pleasantrealtor on August 22nd, 2008 4:35 pm <p> I take the pledge! The house mom &; dad built in the late ' 50? s has a pink bathroom I still use when I visit. It has to large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall... love it! I agree with the other comments about how awful it is when these home improvement shows demo these bathrooms! They are demolishing architectural history! Also, as a realtor, I see lots of retro bathrooms that are so cool... but the buyers want to update first thing! I just found this website and think it 's great. I 've been a retro fan for many years and friends and family think I 'm nuts. I will have to let them know about the site to show them I 'm not the only one <p> I want a pink bathroom. I have to resort to pink accessories and the like, but a 50s pink bathroom has always been one of my dreams! Here 's a look at my bathroom : http : //tinyurl.com/5tqgxl <p> I take the pledge and salute pink bathrooms! <p> Kathleen on September 14th, 2008 5:40 am <p> Thank Heaven I found this! I thought I was the only one with a pink bathroom obsession. I looked for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements. Mine turned out to be a peachy pink which is still amazing. And, that was to be the sellers ' next project. I removed the scary eighties wallpaper, valance and light fixtures. Then, the mauve linoleum was changed to a fabulous retro Marmoleum. Now, it is my retro shabby chic powder room. I can not wait to look at everyone 's photos. <p> KristinIrene on September 19th, 2008 7:57 pm <p> Just moved into a 1953 " mini-ranch " and while we ended up with a precious grey tiled bathroom, I honored it by painting the walls PALE PINK!!! It is lovely. Driving down the street yesterday, I saw in the front yard of a home being remodeled... a gorgeous pink toilet. They would not let me take it. <p> Our house is a 1920 bungalow, but the bathroom was redone in 1952 -- all my friends wanted to help me gut it, but I could never do that. <p> We were convinced by those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burgundy -- same color as the darkest trim tiles -- and to go all out with art deco style fixtures. Love. <p> It really does make everyone 's skin glow! <p> Janice on October 6th, 2008 1:41 am <p> I just hung a round 1950s bird mirror in our pink bathroom in our 1950s ranch. A dream come true! The other bathroom is green tile with yellow fixtures and all orginal hardware, including lucite knobs... very cool! <p> So I therefore also pledge to preserve all old bathrooms, pink and green! <p> I own a house built in 1954. It has a PINK bathroom and I love it! I am now on a quest to replace the Standard pink toilet, which is no longer working, and the pink sink, which has a hairline crack in the bowl. The tub is fine, just needs new fixtures. The shower doors have the original pink and blue Swan decals! This PINK bathroom is really the heart of my house...

There was no saving it. <p> I just closed two weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there was termite-damage. We had to completely gut my bedroom and bathroom. My dream come true has become a bit of a nightmare, but we are weathering it alright. <p> The bathroom we had to demolish was *so* very pink, but not in a retro cool way that you would want to keep -- it was pink and brown. Salmon pink tile, with burnt raisin brown tile trim, and the toilet and sink were a regular pink, but clashed with the salmon, so the overall effect was barfy.

I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... shipping would have been more than I could afford. My daughter, visiting from PA, found a pink set for bathroom #1, and a mint green set for bathroom #2...... so I can restore BOTH with the vintage pieces. The best thing is that she found all of this from one seller in Atlanta, Ga for $200! From here, Atlanta is about a 5 hour trip, so daughter &; son-in-law drove there to pick up everything( and spend the day doing the town, as well). Renovations begin next week. I 'll post before and after pictures later. I 'm happy that I can keep my pink bathroom.. and I LOVE my kids! Life is good. <p> Phyllis <p> Kathy on October 30th, 2008 3:41 pm <p> I need tiles and a towel bar to repair my 50s pink bathroom. I have been searching and not having much success.

Dottie <p> Pam on November 9th, 2008 7:41 pm <p> Wow! I just found your website via AuctionWally and Vintage + Goodness. Count me in for taking the pledge. <p> I fell in love with this 1945 house when I saw one of the bathrooms : it 's pink tile( walls and floor) with green tile edging PLUS a square bathtub. So many people have laughed at this room it 's very irritating! My husband wanted to remodel and get rid of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NO <p> I 'm so glad there are other people out there who love these older designs. <p> I have a dark red toilet &; sink from another older home but do n't know where to put them. Toooo cute! <p> Does anyone watch the HGTV show " Property Virgins "? It seems like every week these young people who 've never owned a home look at wonderful old bathrooms and original tile and say " that has to go ". What are they thinking? Beige tiles from Home Depot? <p> Andrea on November 19th, 2008 11:06 am <p> I pledge! We have a 1960? s built home with a pink bathroom, and lots of other wonderful mid-century original features. Think recessed lounge room lighting behind the pelmet, giving a cascade effect down the curtains at night! The original owners tell us they used to have red and blue flouro lights in there!( Have n't quite got to restoring those yet!). We love it! I just found this website and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on November 20th, 2008 12:50 am <p> I PLEDGE! I bought a 1959 ranch in Pittsburgh 3 years ago, and after the 3 diamond windows in the front door and the circular laundry shoot in the kitchen, the TWO pink bathrooms were definitely the top selling points. The hallway bath is pink and grey, featuring pink tub, pink toilet and pink Barbie-esque vanity with peg legs and the fixtures on a slant( two photos features on this website). The master bath is about closet-sized and is yellow and pink, with a pink toilet and pink sink. The best feature, though, is the incredibly small yellow triangular shower that barely fits one person. <p> Here in Pittsburgh we have a great architectural salvage warehouse called Construction Junction. I know there is something similar in Baltimore and probably several other cities. Great place to find old tubs, sinks, toilets in every color, plus fixtures. Not always bargains, though. <p> Many many years ago I worked for the publishing arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book that I got to name -- The Well-Appointed Bath -- which basically reprinted pages from early American Standard catalogs. I see some of them here. It was quite a status symbol to have these bathrooms after WWII!!! The book is out of print but you could probably find it online. <p> We applaud your effort! One of our customers told us about this site. Yes, we also love those great pink( &; other colored) bathrooms. And yes, we are an architectural salvage firm that sells, YES-PINK vintage toilets, sinks, bath accessories, tubs &; more! We believe in saving all those fab bathroom pieces. If you do n't have the love for those wonderful old vintage bathrooms... at least have the sense to recycle the items so someone else can have the opportunity to have &; enjoy them. Check our site out at http : **30;10592;TOOLONG. We have hundreds of vintage plumbing pieces available. 888-243-6915. <p> I bought a bungalow in old Tampa with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box full of replacement tiles for the original bathroom. It broke my heart to discover that the bath had once been tiled with pink hex tiles, but some cretin remodeled it and tiled it in beige. I long for a day when I can own a house with an original or a retro-fitted pink bathroom. <p> I just found your site and Flickr group. I currently live in a vintage house( with a plain white bathroom that was remodeled in the 70? s with boring white tile, that is now worn and cracking.) I am hoping someday to purchase this little house and Remodel the heck out of it. I PLEDGE( well I was going to do it anyway,) to re-do the bathroom in PINK( and black) tile and fixtures as soon as my budget allows. My grandmother 's San Antonio house back in the day- my earliest memories were of her house and it 's pink and maroon tiled bathroom( well my own family 's house had a pretty cool baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those HGTV shows with the home remodels ripping out the cute green, blue and above all PINK bathrooms( and let us not forget the avocado green kitchens!) can just go straight to " H.E.-Double hockey sticks! " <p> It has been my lifelong dream to have a pink bathroom of my very own and I will someday. -- Janine <p> Kris on December 30th, 2008 3:07 am <p> I have a pink and black tiled bathroom, and love it! I did add a new toilet and sink when I bought, and replaced the horriffic laminate flooring with white tile. It adds such character to the house! <p> But, here is my dilemma : the person that owned the house before us replaced the pink toilet seat with a new one that does n't quite match. And the tank is cracked. So, do I replace the pink toilet with a white one( leaving pink floor tiles, wall tiles, tub and sink) or try to find an exact matching pink toilet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out too much and an exact match will be too hard to find. <p> What 's a retro girl to do?! <p> AnnR on January 3rd, 2009 4:53 pm <p> I 'm gon na keep ours! I 'm not any great retro person but it 's very functional and I " m way too cheap to replace it with something I know wo n't be as nice. <p> Rich on January 5th, 2009 1:54 am <p> We have a 1955 cape with 2 bathrooms : 1 yellow and black tile, 1 maroon and pink tile. We are re-decorating the pink bathroom now and have been looking for a retro wallpaper that will help us embrace the pink tile. The wallpaper we like best is the pink and grey geo wallpaper on the banner of this website. Could you tell me who the manufacturer is and where we could order it. Thanks, and long live the pink bathroom!! <p> 50s Pam on January 5th, 2009 12:54 pm <p> Sorry, Rich, that 's from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the retro decorating gods will surely send you what you want/need.

Okay... <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potties and to persevere over pressure to part with my practical pedestal where my pint size prince and princess piddle... I Promise! <p> Hud on January 20th, 2009 9:36 pm <p> We have restored a 1936 Tudor Revival with an original pink bathroom( photos uploaded to your Flickr). Of course, later owners in the 70? s replaced most of the fixtures with 1970? s bathroom chic, but we found the original sink and toilet in the garage! We then re-plumbed it, and re-installed! <p> I pledge! I just bought a house built in 1904 and they remodeled one of the bathrooms in the 50s. I have the pink and sandstone combination <p> You can see it on my blog where I just posted it. <p> rue <p> Pink Is In on February 26th, 2009 11:16 am <p> We 're keeping our pink bathroom, primarily because I hate fibreglass tubs and wo n't give up the enamel. Also, it works, so why toss it in the landfill and spend money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiles are halfway up the wall : grey with a row of black at the top. The lino is curling and has to be replaced, have n't decided what to go with, but we 're removing the moldy wallpaper on the upper half of the wall and painting it fushia. Not sure how it will look, but have a feeling it will be awesome. <p> I take the pledge a long time ago... in fact, years ago to love the color pink forever and forever. I have a pink toilet sitting in my garage( mint) that is waiting for a pink bathtub( northern Michigan, if anyone has one). PINK RULES! <p> Love that you are embracing all things pink, especially in the bathroom. Your images are inspiring and motivating. Thanks for this.. I will be sure to point all my pink friends in your group 's direction. <p> Who needs pink tile? I removed it from the walls of a small bathrooom. I think it 's 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the back. They could use a little cleaning from the thinset and grout. They are about 4 inches. Some are from the shower and some from the walls. I 'm about to take the floor tiles up but they do n't look to hot and I do n't know if I can save them from breaking. If you want to know more, please email me at deloachden1@yahoo.com. I 'll probably list them on eBay if I do n't get a response soon. <p> Ellen on March 9th, 2009 2:03 pm <p> I adore my parents ' pink bathroom in their early 1960s home. I pledge to continue advocating that they keep their pink tile along with the light brown and pink floral wallpaper with splashes of silver as well as the tiny mirror that 's painted with a pink and brown Vogue cover from the 1910s or 20s. What can I say? I 'm a sentimental gal. <p> A year ago while house-shopping, we saw a wonderful two-bedroom GI Bill style house with a pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, gloss white painted walls above it, and shiny chrome faucets. I fell in love with the bathroom and even Mr. Bassora thought the bathroom was really nice. We have now owned the house for a year. Mr. Bassora added a pink toilet seat on the white American Standard( he actually likes pink... for the bathroom). A clear shower curtain( being held up by white flowers) allow us to see the pink plastic lace curtains above the bathtub. I have added various pink( and some white) items -- can sometimes find REALLY good deals at Target. I love our pink bathroom. I 've had friends actually compliment our littlest room in the house. <p> Michelle on March 12th, 2009 10:09 pm <p> I pledge to keep my pink bathroom in my Craftsman style house. I have decided it 's too hard to keep up with trends, so I am decorating my home to match its style. Dark wood trim, stained glass windows, etc. My pink bathroom is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had installed a drain in the middle of the floor so I could just wash it down with a hose. <p> I live in a 1964 ranch house with a small pink master bath- which I LOVED the minute I saw!!! We actually sold our brand new cookie cutter style vinyl siding house to buy an older one... with CHARACTER! I pledge to never destroy my awesomely pink bathroom! <p> Oh- and my parents still live in their 60s ranch, and it also has a pink bathroom... maybe that 's why I love mine so much! <p> InAustin on March 14th, 2009 7:41 pm <p> I pledge to save the pink bathroom. <p> I just bought a 1959 ranch. We 've begun peeling away the 70s renovations, as well as washing away 50 years of wear and tear. <p> I think this must have been a very low end, starter house. The shower is tiled in pink, with pink around the sink basin, but the toilet and other porcelain fixtures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think a white toilet would look fine. <p> What would n't look fine is brown/gray vinyl asphalt flooring. I 'm afraid we 're going to have to cover that! It 's a very small bathroom, so we 'll probably be able to afford to do a nifty mosaic tile, but I am exploring more modern floorings with a similar look. <p> Thanks for all the photos and ideas! <p> GF on March 17th, 2009 6:31 pm <p> I love ALL things Pink. Always have. On of my college professors had a Pink kitchen complete with pink ' fridge/stove. I have wanted one every since and I will have it!! <p> Yeah -- save ALL things pink! <p> PS : Both of my grandmother 's had those pink fish. <p> Muriel on March 22nd, 2009 9:25 pm <p> We were delighted to see the pink bathroom saved in St.Louis. We, also saved our pink tiles and built the colors in rest of the room around them. Our 39 year-old son said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did have the tub re-enameled white and changed the off pink sink and toilet to white. Our fixtures are black tile. <p> kathismom on March 26th, 2009 3:10 pm <p> So glad to have found this site and the retrorenovation one as well as I have a 1957 Ranch with a Lovely( with a capital " L ") pink bathroom. I will have to get some pics for you. Pink tile, through out, pink sink, pink toilet. I 'd love to put some of this wallpaper up... http : **35;10624;TOOLONG... and redo it a bit but right now I 'm working on my kitchen. <p> I 'm saving my pink bathroom! <p> Katherine Cascamo on April 2nd, 2009 9:09 pm <p> Dear Pink Bathroom Loving Folks, <p> God help me! Until a friend pointed out your blog I thought my Pepto pink bathtub was disgusting! In fact I planned on tearing it out and replacing it this week. I am only slightly enlightened to what appears to be a pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my pink tub. Quite honestly and in all due respect I do not like my pink bathtub. We 've posted a video on Facebook jabbing fun at our pink bathtub. Yet, out of respect for your following I must ask for your help in reconciling my differences. Maybe I could even come to appreciate this pepto pink bathtub( I hesitate strongly to say ' love '). I am an open minded person that with some guidance and perhaps design ideas might even appreciate it 's pepto bismol color. Your involvement would be most appreciated. <p> Woodbu on April 3rd, 2009 3:59 am <p> I only wish I had a pink bathroom to save... during our last round of house hunting we saw a flat with the most fantastic 1960s pink bathroom -- the corner bath was enormous, ceramic, and shaped like a scallop shell, complete with ridges down the inside, and the sink and toilet were a matching shade of pale salmon pink. Sadly my husband hated the bathroom so much he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every way. I still dream of that tub, tarted up with some full-length mirrors, vanity lighting strips and wallpaper with a geometric pattern in pink, almond, chocolate and raspberry... <p> Sarah Evns on April 5th, 2009 4:02 am <p> I LOVE PINK BATHROOMS! I just bought a 1935 house from the original owner( the daughter of the people who built it in 1935) and it has a beautiful, perfectly intact pink bathroom with black tile trim. The fixtures are white( thank goodness) but the bathroom is pink pink pink! It 's so hard to find old bathrooms people have n't ripped out all the tile and charm from! It 's my favorite room in the house, and was a huge selling point, even though in the ads for sale they did n't put photos of the bathroom b/c it 's so retro. <p> Pinkwannabe on April 8th, 2009 12:52 am <p> I pledge to spread the gospel of mid-century design, reminding all those who decry the pink bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise to honor sea foam green and aqua and sunny yellow and baby blue. I even shall honestly try to embrace the unloved- the avocados, the harvest golds, and the browns- those banes of my youth that I now am grudgingly beginning to appreciate. All of these colors tell stories, and I vow to do my best to pass the stories on- in my own boring 2001 box that I have equipped with its own faux pink bathroom( replete with poodle, ballerina, and tropical bird chalk plaques), and everywhere I see a pink diamond in the rough waiting to be shined up and treasured! <p> Kat on April 11th, 2009 5:19 pm <p> I 'm happy to say that we 're in the process of purchasing a 1950s bungalow with an intact original pink bathroom. Only the floor tile has been replaced, so I 'll be looking into replacing that with something less contemporary and more in keeping with the pinky-ness. So exciting! <p> Allie on April 24th, 2009 10:07 pm <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and, as I was looking for bathroom inspiration, I somehow stumbled across this site. I 've now decided to keep the pink! Somehow, your site did what my design-savvy friend 's urging to " work with the pink " could not do. <p> OOO! Wow! I am so glad I found this site.I live in a 1950? s vintage beach cottage and have a peachy, pinky bathroom! I am looking for vintage bath accessories too! I will have to take picks when cleaned up! <p> I love pink bathrooms!! I just lost my job in a decrotive plumbing store after 10 years, and felt devistated. But like all good old house lovers would do, I pulled it together opened my own business, and here I am leading people to the Preserve The Pink side. Love it, Leave it, accessorize! <p> I pledge to Save my Pink Bathroom w/ it 's AMAZING Turquoise &; Silver Wallpaper! I am not a PINK person, HOWEVER I would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posted Pics to the Flickr page! Hope you enjoy them! <p> I do pledge to help save the pink bathroom. Mine is safe.. very pink and black, not touched since the 50? s... and will stay that way safe in our house. <p> Cathryn in NY on May 24th, 2009 12:57 pm <p> My dad was a plumber, he instilled in me the love of all things potty. The pink came from my mom, probably. Great website!! <p> Barbara O on May 27th, 2009 6:41 pm <p> Hail to the retro pink bathrooms! I have one( pink &; black) and we are very proud to show it off! <p> Barbara O <p> PatMc on June 3rd, 2009 1:15 pm <p> I pledge to " save the pink bathroom ". I 'm so glad I found this site. We 're in the process of renovating our 1960? s Levitt home. The pink bathroom is next on the adjenda. I love the pink! My husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now convince him I 'm not the only person in the world that thinks Pink is Perfect. <p> Becky on June 12th, 2009 12:42 pm <p> I love your site! <p> I have been the proud inhabitant of three pink bathrooms in my lifetime. The first I did myself as a teen -- Pepto walls with pink and grey atomic wallpaper in the alcove( and sadly very white, very 70s fixtures). Years later, a boyfriend and I moved into a mid-century mobile home with fabulous pink fixtures and original faux marble Masonite tub surround. More recently, I lived in a Victorian converted post-war into student apartments. My bathroom not only had 12? ceilings, but pink ceramic tiles to a height of 6?. <p> Now I 'm helping a friend slowly fix up his post-war tract house. I have no chance of getting him to go pink, but not for lack of trying! <p> Peggy Marks on June 15th, 2009 7:09 pm <p> I have always had the pledge inside! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually raising " save the pink bathroom " consciousness, but I will do my best. I live near an old town with old homes, and I plan to search for anyone with a pink bathroom, and thank them for keeping it pink. Sad to say, most of those homes are not for sale. People treasure them. <p> June Border on June 24th, 2009 8:14 pm <p> I hereby pledge to do everything in my power to Save the Pink Bathrooms! I do not own one myself but I think that they are FAB. I do however have a pink boomerang formica and knotty pine kitchen which I use to show nonbelievers that pink rooms are a good thing! <p> Jen on June 27th, 2009 1:11 am <p> I just found this website while searching for design help on Google. I 'm renovating my very own pink bathroom, which I treasure. I was looking for design help on how to take my pinkie back to it 's original glory. This site is perfect! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink bathroom and to fight tirelessly to save any and all pink bathrooms I encounter until my last breath! They will have to remove the pink tile from my cold dead hands! This is personal to me... I grew up in a beautiful San Francisco 1920? s house with a great pink and black bathroom. Recently my husband and I purchased our first home and it too has a pink bathroom. No wonder I felt right at home when I saw this house. Prior to this, we were in a rental which had ghastly ' earth ' tones in the bathroom decor.( If I want ' earth ' tones I 'll roll around in the dirt in the yard thankyouverymuch). And I too cringe when I see the so-called ' upgrades ' on HGTV of perfectly great vintage houses. It is criminal. It upsets me so much that I soak in my soothing pink bathroom to regain my composure. <p> Kristina on July 17th, 2009 3:51 pm <p> I have a pink bathroom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Someone had put pink and blue wallpaper on the walls in the 80? s and it looks awful!! I 'm trying to go back to a retro theme. The easiest thing for us to do was to re-wallpaper it. If you go to American Blinds, you can search for wallpaper and select pretty much the exact color. It will show you which wallpapers include that color. Lots to choose from. I hope this helps you preserve your bathroom!!! <p> I am in my 3rd home with a vintage pink tile bathroom!! In an ever renovating world, my realtor says we 're one of the few couples she knows that actually WANTS a home with the vintage tile. I 've also had yellow, blue, and green. But the pink is my favorite! <p> Aileen on August 8th, 2009 12:04 am <p> Hello Brothers and Sisters of the Pink Bathroom Revival! We just bought a house in La Habra that was built in 1955 and much to our surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potty and tub but also their yellow tile kitchen with Western Holly range vent! When my husband called his mom to tell her about the house he opened with " I have a pink toilet " she said well rip it out and replace it with a white one, he answered " that wo n't go with my pink tub. " Pink has never been my favorite color( shame, shame) but then I gave birth to a little girl and pink suddenly seemed sweet, reassuring. Even if I had not been converted to pink( sort-of) I am always for preserving the original. I still miss my metallic olive green 1972 Dodge Dart.... <p> I am moving into a 1950? s style ranch house in a couple of weeks and am THRILLED that I will have a beautiful pink bathroom to work with! People really do not realize the history and beauty a Mamie Pink bathroom has. I 'm hoping to be able to prove to my friends in the area that they are worth saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I can only decorate my bathroom, as I live in an apartment. I pledge to get pink bathmats and rugs, pink accessories... possibly a pink toilet seat. It will go with me when I move. <p> When I first bought my 1974 home with the 1984 rose-pink-NOT-Mamie-pink bathroom remodel( including rose-pink grout between my white floor tiles), I was dead set on doing what I could to downplay the color. I have since realized that I need to instead embrace it! Let the wallpaper hunting begin! <p> Benzmom on August 16th, 2009 11:09 am <p> So happy to see all these posts, but I need support and advise for my grey/burgundy 50s bathroom. Any direction toward sites for lovers of these 50s color tiles, please let me know! <p> thanks so much!! <p> 50s Pam on August 16th, 2009 12:00 pm <p> Hi Benzmom -- see all the resources in the right-hand column. There are lots! <p> James on August 19th, 2009 8:35 pm <p> My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought a ' 62 colonial in suburban Cleveland. In the main bathroom, the tub, sink and toilet were all salmon pink. The one inch square floor tiles were white, interspersed with pastel squares of pink, yellow, mint green and sky-blue. Really kind of cool. The walls were white. We decided to play up the pink by painting the walls a very pale shade of pink- a sort of " icy pink " if that makes sense. So, we took a pink bathroom and made it pinker. <p> Now, the confession. 10 years ago, we bought a ' 63 colonial( I use the term " colonial " loosely- this colonial has picture windows) in suburban Chicago. The " family bath " off the hall was pink- pink toilet, twin sinks and tub, with white and coral pink tiles on the floor and climbing 3/4 up the walls. By this time, we had two sons- we have no daughters. As we have a master bath in this house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bath became our sons ' bathroom. Well, we wanted to stay " mid-century " but could not stick our boys with a pink bathroom. So, we got a new white toilet and twin sinks and had the tub re-glazed in white. To stay " mid-century modern " we re-glazed all of the pink wall tiles in aqua blue. The floor was replaced with large square aqua tiles. Does this disqualify us from the " Save the Pink Bathrooms " league? We did save that pink one in Cleveland, making it even pinker.... Just askin. <p> John D Taylor on August 20th, 2009 9:14 am <p> OMG. I have admit that Pink Bathrooms are the bomb. Mamie Eisenhower had it going on when she planted pink into our head oh so many years ago. She made a difference in our bathrooms and with our pink imagination. God live the Pink Bathroom. JT <p> indigospires on August 20th, 2009 9:21 am <p> If anyone in Austin, TX would like to upgrade to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named D.A.R. has a tub, pedestal sink, and toilet -- a matching set! -- for sale at their Old Howard 's Nursery location. <p> nancy humphries on August 20th, 2009 10:09 am <p> We have just renovated my childhood home built in1949 and certainly saved the pink and blue bathroom! My crew said I was not like a normal woman -- one who wants all torn out and replaced with new updated stuff! I told them I was " old enough to appreciate the old " since I am 62! Also we have a double drainboard sink made in 1949 and in really good condition with metal cabinets below. We also took up the carpet and refinished hardwood floors that were original with the house. Mahoghany dining room and bedroom furniture that my parents had bought in High Point, NC in 1949 are also being used! We move in next Tuesday and I ca n't wait!!! <p> Teri Powers on August 20th, 2009 11:50 am <p> I love my little bungalow which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love my pink tile bathroom and pink tile floor. Right now I have a Ralph Lauren look shower curtain in powder blue with big cabbage roses and my pink porcelain bird planter and my blue ceramic bird planters that add to that retro look. I pledge to keep my bathroom pink! <p> Janet Gore on August 20th, 2009 11:54 am <p> Speaking of Mamie Eisenhower... if you were to tour the Eisenhower Farm at Gettysburg, you would find a closet filled with " Mamie Pink " linens! <p> Mariah Smith on August 20th, 2009 11:56 am <p> I bought my 1963 Levitt and Sons Cape Cod house partially because it still had its pink and blue bathtubs( with blue surround tile) intact. I acquired the matching pink sink and toilet when a neighbor was renovating their bathrooms and removed their lovely pink fixtures for something boring and white I am sure! Now just to find a freebie blue sink and toilet and my retro renovation will be complete! <p> Debbie Van Dorn on August 20th, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I was growing up we lived in a duplex. Our neighbor had a pink and black bathroom and that 's what I decided would be the most perfect bathroom ever... I 'm also a " baby boomer " who 's old enough to appreciate Pink! <p> Jane on August 20th, 2009 12:54 pm <p> I have been pining for light carnation pink towels and they are just not a color in the stores these days. If I ever find them, my bathroom for SURE has a pink renovation in store for it!( I grew up in a pink tiled, pink tub, etc. 50? s bathroom in Elmhurst, Illinois!) <p> Thomas Carnahan on August 20th, 2009 2:45 pm <p> Yes save the retro pink, and " down with the MAC MANSIONS! " <p> Zoe on August 20th, 2009 3:16 pm <p> While I wish I could pledge to save the blue bathroom( that 50? s blue is such a peaceful color, but alas, blue is the ONE color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use for bathrooms -- yellow, green, peach and pink being the winners of that particular contest), I will by default to pledge to save my existing pink powder room from renovation. <p> I think if you do have a pink bathroom, you have to just go with it. No sense pretending that it 's a neutral, because it is n't. Restoration Hardware has some white and pink kitchen towels that make lovely powder room hand towels, btw. <p> My husband just re-modeled our 1950 bathroom and after much discussion, I WON and we kept the pink! My walls are the traditional Mamie Pink tile, trimmed out with a beigy-pink. My floot ir the traditional pink tile with the grey grout, my laminate vanity counter is the pink and grey boomerang, but the tub, sink and toilet are white???!!! Should I look for some vintage pink appliances or leave well enough alone? Help! <p> Jackie Glover on August 20th, 2009 5:18 pm <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love it. Unfortunately, the previous owner ripped out part of the floor and some of the wall tile. I 'm still looking for some more Stylon tile and a few feet of the floor mosaic( like the bottom link one on this page. I did find a vintage pink sink to replace his " renovated " one. Cost $20 -- beautiful, plus $80 for shipping! <p> I pledge to save the pink bathroom, to hold her sacred in all her pink glory. My bathroom has pink walls, but alas, I need more...

I fit right in with my 50? s kitchen aprons and my love for that era. Everything is cyclical. I truly believe that we are the new " in " trend, if not now, then in the near future. To those who love the granite and the expensive floor tile, well, those folks can have it!!! Do n't fix it unless it 's broken!!! Keep the pink!!! <p> Becky on August 28th, 2009 9:25 am <p> I solemnly swear to preserve my pink bathroom despite pressure from TV shows to convert to flat paint khaki or some other boring, bland color. Thank heaven for Rachel Ashwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink towels whatsoever in stores! <p> Maria. on August 30th, 2009 12:44 pm <p> I have a 1940? s house, but alas, not a pink bathroom.

I take great comfort and strength knowing that there are folks who are actively trying to maintain our oh so colorful past. <p> p. parker powell on September 4th, 2009 4:22 pm <p> Oh, HOW FUN!! I only dream of finding that perfect little house with the pink bathroom. When first looking at my house, I thought I saw the glimmer of pink coming from the bathroom, but it sadly turned out to be a lovely shade of peach which is not all that bad, but when I then saw the ' coordinating ' blue toilet and tub I was, to say the least, disappointed. But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today I still live with the combo and it has become the one room with the most coats of paint as I try to determine what looks ' best '... yikes! I am just a ' pink ' person and always will be! So onward to find that cute little pink bathroom... I know there 's one waiting. Note to CHRIS( comment) from University City, St. Louis.... I also live near there and once lived an old apartment building in Clayton with lovely mint green tiles. All the old 1920 buildings around here are classic... I miss the great architecture that is so much missing today! Vintage PInk Designs, St. Louis <p> when i first bought my 1940? s house I cringed at the pink on pink bathroom...... frustrated by the lack of cooperation from every paint choice i tried to pair with all that pink tile!

At first, I thought how the heck am I going to decorate this. With your website, I 've found new inspiration, and will be dreamin ' pink! <p> Pam on September 14th, 2009 9:23 pm <p> Just bought a house with a pink bathroom about 2 years ago. Tiles for the most part in excellent shape. Need to repaint. Have added flamingos. It 's a start! <p> I do n't have a pink bathroom, but I do have a vintage one -- octagon white tiles, free standing pedestil sink, decorated w/pink towels.

Thank you for the inspiratation! <p> Laura <p> Vicki Johnson on September 26th, 2009 3:21 pm <p> I pledge to try to keep pink bathrooms alive! I can not stand when " House Hunters " or " House Renovaters " or even " Flip this House " tears out a pink bathroom because it is " out of date. " I do not watch that paticular " channel " for that reason. The architechs redo all the glorious vintage and put in new crap. At least that is my opinion, and I 'm stick'in to it! <p> Vicki Johnson on September 26th, 2009 3:36 pm <p> P.S. My new home is painted different shades of pink throught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Pink person. Her home was a salmon colored brick. I do not remember if her bathrooms were pink... I think her bathroom, the bath off of the master bedroom was. Pink with the black accent tiles. I inheretide( sorry about all the spelling errors) many wonderful antique pieces from her. And now I collect many pink things. I have to be careful, my house had become overun with objects. But when we cleaned out 2/3rds, we kept anything thing that was pink and any thing that had roses. I do not know where this long rant came, perhaps it is " My Pink Passion. " thanks for the space to rant! <p> I just today began peeling the paint off of my walls to uncover the beautiful PINK tile. I pledge to restore the walls &; my pink bathtub/shower walls! <p> My original intent was a complete remodel, until I found this site.We already got rid of the sink &; toilet, however <p> Ca n't wait to peel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leah <p> Laura Barrett on September 27th, 2009 12:33 am <p> I hereby pledge to preserve the pink potty, save the pink sink, and treasure the pink tub that will be my legacy. Currently in my mom 's house, but one day all this will be mine. Also, I shall save the blue bathroom that is the pink one 's mirror image. Until such time, I 'll be staying busy preserving the 50? s farmhouse next door that belonged to my grandparents. <p> Kathy Majcherek on September 28th, 2009 8:54 am <p> I am taking this pledge in spirit. While I do n't have a pink bathroom, our home was build in 1960. I does have a seafoam green bath and a blue bath. I pledge to save these baths. And add pink where ever I can. <p> Jennifer Laus on September 28th, 2009 9:52 am <p> When we bought our house 14 years ago( built in 1949), one of the things that made me say " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brown tile with the black border on the bathroom floor. It was covered in an ugly dark carpet, and some of the tiles were broken, but it was lovely. The first thing we did was rip out the carpet and fix the broken patches( carefully removing tiles from behind the sink and toilet( replaced them with black to match the border). I think the walls were peach originally( we painted them a sunny yellow before we found the evidence). As we do further work( replacing the bath surround tile, etc), I intend on making it look more retro and restoring some of the lost charm. <p> Addrienne Matheny on September 28th, 2009 1:07 pm <p> I pledge to save my pink bathroom. It was one of the selling points in 1954 ranch. Sadly, the floor was replaced in the 80? s with a hideous vinyl floor, but thanks to this blog I now know what kind of flooring to replace it with. I was also able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one the was badly cracked. I love my pink bathroom! <p> I pledge to save the pink bathrooms( if I ever get one) but will start with my Turquoise one! <p> Andrea Struble on September 28th, 2009 3:34 pm <p> I have happily saved my own pink bathroom -- and a turquoise one -- in my 1952 Cape Cod. Those bathrooms were my " consolation prizes " 4 years ago at having to move from the beautiful Victorian that we lovingly restored for 16 years( too many stairs to the front door). Thanks largely to my pink and turquoise bathrooms, I fell madly in love with this Cape Cod and never looked back! My pink tiled bathroom has pearl gray walls and a black tile floor( not original but nice &; in great shape) and is -- ahem -- decorated in Early Elvis. I could n't help it. I almost went French Poodles, but Elvis -- a life-long passion -- won out in the end. Where else could you decorate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your Pink Bathroom Crusade! <p> My husband 's grandmother had a glorious pink and gray bathroom -- and a yellow and gray bathroom. She died last year at 96 and her children sold her house. I do n't know what happened to it, I can only hope that the new owner adores the bathrooms. <p> Sally on September 28th, 2009 6:10 pm <p> I am saving the pink bathroom! My newly purchased 1958 brick rancher has a pink bathroom. The tiled walls and shower are pink with pink soapdishes and toothbrush holder. The tub/toilet/sink are white. The floor was replaced at some point, but I pine for a pink and white mosaic. My parents completely re-did their 1959 blue bathroom a couple of years ago. I miss it and wished I 'd had this site to help convince them to keep it! <p> stacy devens on September 28th, 2009 8:17 pm <p> I take the pledge! The only thing that I like about my bathroom is the pink bathtub. My husband and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did a remodel of the bathroom where they put tongue and groove wood on both the walls and ceiling and put carpet on the floor( makes no since to me and looks horrible!) The only thing that they did not change was the bathtub. We 've since ripped up the carpet and plan on redoing the bathroom within certain boundaries of freedom( stupid wood has to stay until we own it) The only thing I want to keep is the tub and I wish to find the matching sink and toilet one day. <p> I pledge to save the pink bathrooms and will encourage others to do the same! <p> Deb LuvMidCen on September 28th, 2009 9:28 pm <p> I promise to save the pink bathroom! In fact I am tearing out my bathroom to create a 50? s Pink Poodle Palace. Plans include black sink, tub and toilet. Walls will be pink with black trim. Floors are up in the air. I like the 2? x 2? hex tiles with flowerettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor tile( too busy he says), he loves the idea of the pink bath. The project has hit a snag as the pink tile priced out at over $8 sq foot. So I am continuing to shop... surely I can get it for less than that! <p> I pledge to save what remains of my pink bathroom( only the tub and toilet remain), and to reuse these pieces in a new bathroom if I should have to remove the bathroom during a planned addition( which I think I will). I also pledge to do everything possible to find another vintage bathroom set to put in the new master bathroom. <p> I 'm new on the MCM lovers scene. It did n't really hit me until I was temporarily staying at a furnished 1952 single family house for a few months in 2007 while my own home was being gutted and renovated( thanks to a hurricane... ugh). <p> This little house had 2 bathrooms and one had delightful pink( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I wish that I could have replicated that color scheme in one of my own bathrooms... but my husband does n't share my love of the style. *sigh* <p> We did paint the walls of one of our own bathrooms pink. And I guess that is as close as I will ever get in my 1985 townhouse. I vote YES on pink bathrooms, and keeping or restoring period homes in their original styles. <p> Sabrina on September 29th, 2009 11:22 pm <p> I pledge! We bought our 1957 home in the Berkeley hills a few months ago. The previus owners had owned the house since 1963 and have n't renovated anything as far as I can tell. We have a realy lovely pink marble formica counter in our main bathroom( complete with cast-iron sink) and it is staying. The floor tiles( not pink) will probably have to be changed, but will likely be pink when we do it. <p> Today I pledge to save my beautiful pink bathroom! You brought me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer will you be forced to wear wall paper that does n't suit your color! You have the strength to stand alone! You are bold! You are beautiful! <p> Sara Tinkelman on September 30th, 2009 2:21 pm <p> It seems every time we 've moved( do n't ask) we 've purchased vintage houses of one era or another and have, without exception, wound up with kitchens and bathrooms that have needed to be gutted. We always seemed to come along after one or more owners had yanked out and replaced the original fixtures( along with other similar tragic violations throughout the house) with cheap ones. To add insult to injury, the work was invariably done by a " handyman ", meaning we were left with no alternative but to take a deep breath &; spend $$$ in order to create something that was not at war with the rest of the house. Curses! Foiled again( and again, and again...)! <p> Believe me when I tell you I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixtures, floor plans, etc. Alas, sometimes there just is n't an option. We now live in a little 1952 split-level whose kitchen and bath -- sigh -- must be removed someday. The work done on them over the years was just brutal. I have a pink and pale gray bathroom. The Am. Stndrd. fixtures are gray, the tiles on the wall and floor are pink. But the original sink was tossed years ago, and the toilet base is cracked and broken. ARGH! <p> Another reader suggested embracing all the colorful bathrooms of that era, and I could n't agree more. The pastels that were so popular when my mother was a bride are just as appealing today as they were then. There 's something sweet and optimistic about these modest treasures, so lets enjoy them all. In other words " Save The Turquoise( Buttercup Yellow, Baby Blue, Mint Green) Bathrooms/Kitchens! Take the pledge! " <p> All of this was topped with Formica in matching light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were wrapped in burnished natural wood with the 50? s cool hammered wrought iron hardware!! <p> My mom was in high school when they built the house &; she got to choose the colors for the bathrooms, I asked her once when I was a kid " why? blue &; orange in Mimi 's bathroom? ", it did n't match to me-a kid. She told me that those were the popular colors that year!! <p> NOW I know better &; have realized that, yes my mom IS cool!!!! <p>( how I wish I had a pink bathroom &/or; pink kitchen) <p> Anne on October 11th, 2009 5:02 pm <p> We will be closing on a home with a pink and black bathroom at the end of the month. Having remodelled three houses, I have a great respect for those who can apply ceramic tile properly. While retro is not my style of choice, there is no way I would demolish the gorgeous tile work in my " new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accentuate the lovely tile work and still maintain my style. I am looking forward to the challenge, and I will try to post photos of before and after. Then it 's on to the blue and pink bathroom in the house. It 's nice to see that there are others who appreciate the quality of the original work. <p> Marilyn Martinez on October 11th, 2009 10:26 pm <p> I pledge to keep my pink bathroom. Actually, I have two pink bathrooms. Both were built about 1950. The color, Muslin from Behr Premium goes quite well with pink. I needed a color that would blend pink, peach and brown tile. My other bathroom has victorian-style wallpaper and tiled floor with pinkish-beige grout. Yes, I 'm definitely keeping the pink. <p> We bought a 1963 Ranch single story-the main bath is Pink! I was n't thrilled about it, but after finding this site-I 'm trying to see what I can do to modernize it with out messing up the Pink Retro style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shower but before we use it I need to either tile( Ughh lot of work) or Wallpaper the top 1/2 with some sort of similar era-style wallpaper( easier) So I now pledge to save my Pink bathroom. Thanks for the awesome website. <p> I purchased a 50s Ranch four years ago with pink 4? x4? and burgundy accent tile on all of the walls. While I admit to at first being repelled by such a girly-girl color, I have learned to embrace my inner-Mamie and love my retro bathroom in all of its fem-fabulous glory. I am about to start the retro-reno process and am looking forward to... <p> 1) Tearing out the beige &; blue, circa-1988 vinyl flooring that screams at the top of its lungs, " ANACHRONISM!!! "( I am hoping the original flooring is underneath. -- fingers crossed! --) <p> 2) Replacing the bathtub( which is beyond salvageable) with a tiled shower instead. Of course all of the tiles above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already chipped/missing(???) in the rest of bathroom when I purchased the house. <p> 3) Re-texturing and repainting the wall above the tile a lovely shade of white to offset the rosiness of the lower 4 feet.( The wall was, unexplainably, rough-textured to look like stucco and then painted the most vomitous shade of purple... yes, purple.) <p> I will have to start a blog( as so many others have) on the process. Wish me much luck! <p> Julie on November 2nd, 2009 5:21 pm <p> I laughed when I found this website! I just spent the last week painting the walls in my pink and black bathroom that looks almost exactly like the one pictured at the top of this site. While the rest of our 1940? s home is restored to be modern and soothing, the bathroom shines as only a pink bathroom can. I hated it once, love it now.. I embraced the period and restored it to original beauty! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have a 1953 ranch we call Rancho Relaxo. We have a pink bathroom, and cherish the history. Photos to come. You have our pledge! <p> Anita on November 21st, 2009 4:28 pm <p> I am so happy to find others who love their pink bathrooms. We love our pink bathroom... 1960 ranch... pink toilet, tub and sink with pink marble vanity with mirror on 2 walls... white tile floor... repainted pink( my friends could not believe it " pink? why pink? ") and we all love how healthy we look even on bad days... lots of white eyelet and white fabric shower curtain then all the accents are with a beach theme... flamingos and colorful flip-flop rugs and seashells... it is not retro totally but we will never rip out our pink bathroom... even the ceiling is painted pink! Embrace the pink! <p> Monica Pair on November 22nd, 2009 9:40 pm <p> I may be buying a house with a pink bathroom!!! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, 2009 10:35 am <p> I 'm in the midst of buying a small Philadelphia rowhouse with a pink( and pale green) bathroom. The pink sink is in dire need of replacement and after seeing this site, I am edging toward retaining the pastel character of the bathroom. <p> ptm on November 28th, 2009 5:43 pm <p> In 1954 my family moved to a lovely new home in the Philadelphia suburbs. The house was fabulously beautiful. My quilted rose wallpaper looked wonderful next to the Mamie pink and maroon bathroom. All the fixtures in the bathroom were maroon which made the pink glow with extra warmth. Alas, in 1964 the maroon toilet seat broke and my folks were not able to find a replacement. So they installed a low slung vented pink toilet and a lovely pink sink. The shower was tiled and did not present the same problem. The modern pink toilet provided endless hours of amusement since the handle pulled out to vent causing lots of noise but no flush. To flush one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost guests for extended periods in the bathroom on many occasions. Finally, children were given the task of lurking near the bathroom to explain the wonders of the commode to unsuspecting visitors. How oh how could anyone gut a room with so many amusing stories. The bathroom remained intact while it remained in the family. 40+ years of the amazing and sneaky pink bathroom. How popular was pink in the mid 50? s? Our kitchen cabinets were the same lovely shade of pink. The lineolium was replaced with a beautiful pink pebble style congolium as soon as it came out. The color was more enduring. Since no one in our family has ever remodeled anything that still had a shred of useful life left, The beautiful pink kitchen was handed over to my red haired sister-in-law who shuddered and lived frugally until she, my brother and their kids could flee to a new home. I despaired of ever enjoying a lovely pink bathroom until yesterday( Thanksgiving 2009). Our family feast had moved from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home. Lo and behold a Mamie Pink bathroom. I told my sister-in-law that she had a treasure. I shall be sending her a link to this site, to fulfill my pledge to encourage preservation of all viable pink bathrooms. <p> ian windham on December 2nd, 2009 3:52 pm <p> I hereby pledge to keep my bathroom pink! We 're proud to own a lovingly maintained and not-too-altered custom 1957 MCM ranch in Everett, WA. Two-tone green tile main bath and grey/charcoal master. Repainting the master walls back to original pink as we speak! The porcelain is all the original grey stuff. Tore out an ugly 70? s shower enclosure that was installed over the original grey step-in corner shower and added a 90 degree chrome rod and curtain. Mahogany trim survived without being painted over YAY! <p> Cathy on December 3rd, 2009 2:31 pm <p> How fun! Yes, I have a Mamie pink bathroom -- floor tiles, bathtub tiles, tiled counter -- very, very pink. It 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. A 1958 ranch house should not be renovated as a yuppie palace if you ask me. <p> Bets on December 3rd, 2009 10:50 pm <p> I bought my 1958 split-level with pink bath 3 yrs ago. Before the closing date, I could barely sleep at night thinking about how I would get rid of all my French country stuff. I did and am stricly mid century all the way. Love the bath with grey tile and Pink fixtures. Unfortunately, they covered original floor tile with whith 6? squares...... Uggg. I will have to replace eventually. <p> Zane Barlow Coleman on December 9th, 2009 8:18 pm <p> We just bought a 1957 Ranch in Western Massachusetts. We have the original pink/black tile walls and also ceramic floor tiles also... its part of the reason I bought the house! We also have the original Thermador wall oven and large cooktop with pancake griddle in the middle... yellow counter tops, faux brick backsplashes and turquoise kitchen floor. We will definitely keep the pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, 2009 11:11 pm <p> Does coral pink count? Had our 1950 raised ranch 's only bathroom been pink with black accent tiles I doubt I would want to keep it, but the light coral pink with maroon accent tiles scheme we have has grown on me, especially since the sink, tub and toilet are white. <p> Tina on December 17th, 2009 11:44 am <p> Unfortunately, we do n't own a pink bathroom, but we want to turn the powder room of our 1980s colonial into a mid-century pink bathroom. We 're keeping our eyes on the Restore in Alexandria, Va, for a toilet and sink to show up. <p> Sheila on December 19th, 2009 5:40 pm <p> When my husband and I bought our 1950 ranch-style home in Michigan, we had a definite consensus on one room being that " the pink bathroom has got to go ". The bubble gum pink tile with burgundy trim ; the floor that gives some a sense of vertigo if it is stared at too long was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself owning, let alone liking. I am a practical person though. That pink bathroom was obviously built to last. The tiles and floor were solid. It is hard to justify ripping this room down first as our house was one fraught with " opportunities ". Many more pressing projects were higher on the agenda. So dropping the bomb on the pink nightmare was postponed. I pondered this bathroom for several months, confounded. The previous owners had given it battleship grey cupboards and trim ; grey wallpaper with a burgundy floral design. It had gold metal glass shower doors that were impossible to keep clean, a door and a ceiling with obvious mould issues. It had two hideous glass light bars on either side of the mirror, also impossible to keep clean. Still I was completely stumped on how to tone down what felt like screaming pink. Inaction was really my only option, figuring one day the solution would come to me, and barring that a wrecking ball was an option. After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basement makeover and 2 kids later, my attention turned once again to fixing up what my daughter calls " the Barbie Dream House bathroom ". Still, dang it -- that tile was solid as the day it was installed. Then it occurred to me that I should just learn to love this bathroom, play up how incredibly campy it was and stop thinking about ways to tone it down or minimize it. I turned to the internet. The day I Googled " fun pink bathroom " was the day that I found this website. Suddenly I began to think that maybe I actually owned something kind of cool. You can be the judge on the final product but I honestly am so proud of how it turns out. Bright, clean, unique and above all, PINK. And I 'm finally more than OK with that. Thanks Pam! Sheila, Defender of Old Pink Bathrooms <p> Thank you for creating this site and bringing attention to our rich, mid-century home design heritage. <p> GP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When my future wife and I were looking for a house, we looked at houses dating from the 1890s to 1962. A couple of the mid century homes still had their original pink bathrooms intact. We ultimately decided on a home built in 1954 that has Geneva metal cabinets and a 1950s GE electric stove in the kitchen and all the original bathroom tiles, although the tiles are green, not pink. There is a newer bathroom in the basement that is very white and generic looking. We 've thought about redoing that one with mid century styled tiles and fixtures to better suit our taste and to match the rest of the house. We 'll let you know if we redo it in pink. <p> Kim Campbell on December 27th, 2009 11:52 am <p> I pledge to save! I do n't have a pink bathroom but someday I hope to!! <p> Justin on December 27th, 2009 12:30 pm <p> When we bought our house a little o a year ago the main bathroom had the pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed out a some point. And the toilet was also a newer toilet. We were able to locate a pink toilet for that bathroom. One of our neighbors has the original vanity with the pink tile and has said that we can have them. We will be careful to take the tile out as to not break any in the process. The mastebathroom also had the pink tile surround in the shower. The sink area we went with the yellow tile( we got it at a used building savage yard. They had two boxes of the yellow never used), with a black border. The floor we went with a black and white tile from home depot that looks period to the house. Then of course the toilet and sink are pink. It turned out bette than we had hoped. I have many pictures to share. <p> Dot on December 27th, 2009 9:39 pm <p> I bought my family home here in Michigan( why does there seem to be so many of us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were ever mine I 'd rip out the pink and gray bathroom. But now that it is mine, like Sheila, I 've come to embrace it. It has the original gray sink( with chrome trim), gray Am St one piece toilet, a planter built in at the end of the vanity, walk in shower stall and like Sheila 's bathroom, tile still attached firmly. I may even still have our pink and white bathroom scale in the basement or out in the garage. And yes, I 'll put wallpaper on the soffit( above the square recessed lights). It needs some work, but it will shine in all it 's pink glory once again. Thanks Pam for two great websites. <p> My family and I just bought a house that was built in 1952 and it has a wonderful retro pink bathroom. I love how warm and inviting and homey it feels. <p> lucy on December 28th, 2009 12:18 pm <p> I bought my 1949 house with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bought it from the orginal owners.

I also pledge to find and use vintage or vintage reproduction tiles when I begin renovation. For those who scoff at pink bathrooms, I say, do n't knock it until you try it! <p> JANE on December 29th, 2009 7:53 pm <p> Our house is a former rental and the former owner did EVERYTHING cheaply. The bathroom is no exception. The pink bathtub is the only thing worth saving. I 'll be purchasing a pink sink and toilet from a local salvage yard and bringing the bathroom back into it 's former glory. <p> chris on December 29th, 2009 10:37 pm <p> I take the pledge! I bought a circa 1958 rancher with a time-warp pink bathroom in great shape. It 's in amazing condition and quite the conversation piece. <p> Am writing from suburban Philly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, PB) neighborhoods. <p> Pink bathrooms ROCK! They make you look all rosy and pretty and would make a nice showcase for some pink Pyrex! <p> Dashkova on December 31st, 2009 1:00 am <p> I held out against my husband, our contractor and tile guy who wanted to replace our 1950? s pink tub, sink, and toilet. Their next argument was that " tans and neutrals " worked best with the pink. Bah! I currently match a pinky-orange and mauve with the pink fixtures and love it that way.( You should see the blue twin bath next to the pink...) Glad to hear of others who love their pink bathrooms. <p> Bashe on December 31st, 2009 1:10 pm <p> I pledge to learn to love our pink sink, pink tub, pink tiles, and pink toilet. I will learn to mourn the pink tile floor that appears to have been replaced by faux-stone linoleum that conceals all unsavory substances. I pledge to try to stop hankering after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly inappropriate in my otherwise charming 1955 house. Thank you for making it possible to love the pink. <p> Though I dislike everything else pink, I loved my aunt 's pink bath, with it 's faux pink tile linoleum around the tub. I absolutely adored the black wall paper with lily pads, white flowers and pink flamingos above the burnt pine wainscoting( and which I 've searched for in vain for years- does n't ANYONE have a pink flamingo pattern with a BLACK background???). I loved the pink fixtures and the white lace curtains. I loved the pink shower curtain with pink flamingos and green lily pads. If I can EVER find wallpaper that matches that description, my bath will pay homage to that most glorious Mamie Pink. <p> Michael S on December 31st, 2009 2:50 pm <p> My little ranch-style house was built in 1958. I bought it in 1998 and the main bathroom was PINK. For 11 years I debated about whether to get rid of the pink. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also because it is in perfect condition. The grout and tile( except floor) look like they were installed yesterday. I can not, in good conscience, demolish something that is functionally perfect. <p> So many 50? s &; 60? s homes here in Australia are renovated to the point where they have no character at all. Our house was built in 1961( we bought it 2 years ago) and the bathroom is original -- it needs " refreshing, but I pledge to keep the original pink bathroom. At my age, I need the softness of the pink glow! <p> David Nevitt on January 1st, 2010 6:32 am <p> I move in Monday 1/04/2010. A 1954 red brick, 3BR, 900sqft ranch. With a PINK bathroom in great shape. I vow to keep it that way. Being a 55yo single man, at first, I thought, " O, great ". After finding this site, it 's, " O GREAT! ". Ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Oh my gosh. I grew up in a house where the main bath had pink tiles with black trim just like you have pictured. Seeing the picture has my mind flooding with fond memoires of my childhood. Sad to say, my parents remodeled it years ago, but my mom who is one for sentiment had the contrator save a few tiles -- one for me and each of my siblings. I have it proudly diplayed in my own bathroom. <p> Dianne K. on January 2nd, 2010 5:20 pm <p> I pledge!!! My parents built their own house in 1955, brick by brick on their own without anyone 's help.I do remember they had a bathroom similar with pink tile, with black accents.Very, very cool.Towards the middle 1970? s they got tired of looking at all of the pink, so they ripped out the tiles to make it more modernized.But in my opinion it was dull and boring with stark white and sterile(yawn) walls.I would make my bathroom vintage looking with the pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, 2010 6:13 pm <p> I adore our 1953 home.... and the pink tub and sink built into the vanity in the bathroom. I will never replace them! I ca n't wait to tile to match and preserve the period bath feel. Hooray pink potties!!! I even plan to 50? s out the basement bathroom as much as possible by retrofitting an old stereo cabinet to hold a sink( cross your fingers) or a supplies cabinet. Love this site! Thanks. -josie <p> Betty on January 3rd, 2010 8:51 pm <p> I close on my 1965 brick ranch on 2-2-10! It has two tiled baths, back to back -- sort of odd -- one in tan shades and the other in pink shades. Both are tiny little squares all over the floor, 1/2 way up the wall and then the whole shower stall in the tan walk in shower and the walls around the PINK tub combo in the other. Must admit my first response was lock the door on the pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @.... BUT, you have inspired me with this site. I feel like a member of an exclusive club or something! I can hardly wait to KEEP IT PINK! Thanks! Betty <p> I love my pink bathroom from the pink tile shower and pink and white tiled floor I ca n't imagine ever changing it to any other color! <p> Darlene on January 5th, 2010 9:17 pm <p> Owning a custom architect built, 1957 ranch is a challenge. I hated my pink bathroom at first, but after a complementary wall paint redo, have come to love the pink tile, shower and sink. Thanks for the inspirational pics on this site. I will pledge to never let anyone disrespect my bathroom again. Nor will I ever consider tearing it out. <p> Lauren G. on January 6th, 2010 10:30 am <p> I just wanted to say I use to have a pink bathroom and I MISS it! My husband and I had a pink and black bathroom( built in the late 1940? s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We moved out of state and like the house we are currently living in fine but both frequently bring up that what we miss most about about our old place is the bathroom... specifically because we miss the pink. My husband has even stated that hopefully we find another house with one at some point! <p> Maggie on January 6th, 2010 11:21 am <p> I solemly do swear to never rip out a pink bathroom, nor encourage anyone else to do the same! I grew up in a house with a pink and black bathroom, lived in a gorgeous colonial for a while that had a spectacular pink and powder blue bath. Now I 'm in a 1958 ranch with a( sigh) white bath... it 's original though! I 'm putting in pink touches though. <p> I 've just signed a purchase agreement on a 1959 house. It 's absolutely beautiful. The main bath has pale pink tile with tiny white trim.( I 'll post pix later). I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The previous owners painted the walls black and everything else( besides the pink tile) is white. It 's not unattractive ; I 'm just not fond of black in a bathroom. I was considering burgundy. Burgundy is my favorite colour, and goes, in my opinion, very well with pale pink ; and it 's much more cheerful than gray. All and any input and opinions is most welcome. <p> Stacy on January 7th, 2010 6:45 pm <p> We are renting a home that we are going to buy. There is a pink bathroom that I thought about changing, but have made up my mind I will not. First, pink is my favorite color &; second I know once I am able to paint &; do my own decor I can make the pink bathroom stand out &; be updated! This is a great idea! <p> Lorri on January 8th, 2010 1:31 am <p> We live in ranch style house that had a pink bathroom. The Real Estate agent never had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the selling feature.During some remodeling we discovered that the outside trim, living room, hall, and laundry room were painted pink as well. <p> Nicole on January 8th, 2010 5:10 am <p> Greetings from Sydney Australia -- I just love your site! <p> The original pink and grey bathroom was a major selling point when we bought our 1960s flat. We absolutely love it! It was the inspiration for turning the whole flat retro to suit it. <p> It took a long time to scour the flea markets, 2nd hand shops and eBay to find just the right pieces, but 18months later -- I love my home to bits, from the pink bath to the egg chair to the teak sideboard to the JVC videosphere to the spaghetti shade pendant lights -- you have my pledge! <p> Liz on January 8th, 2010 10:39 am <p> I 'll take the pledge! I grew up in a ' 50? s Ranch here in AZ. More than anything I would love to have a mid-century home of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1957 pink bathroom fixtures... namely the sink &; the tub. I will respect their vintage heritage and build my design for our bathroom around it. However, the 80? s tile has got to go! Our color scheme will be built around the 1950? s pinkyness! <p> I pledge to restore our entirely lavender bathroom fixtures during our renovation. The bathroom itself is beyond repair but the purple stays. <p> Kelly on January 9th, 2010 12:20 pm <p> I grew up in a pink tiled bathroom. You 'd think I 'd avoid it at all costs when house hunting... but we just bought an amazing 1967 ranch with of course... a pink tiled bathroom! It 's the guest bath, we lucked out an got a beautfiul light green tile in the master. I actually already promised our home inspector that we would n't touch it! I 'm trying to think of ways to compliment the pink tile with a strong contrast wall color. Does anyone have photos to a pink and brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great! <p> 50s Pam on January 9th, 2010 1:02 pm <p> Kelly, head on over to Retro Renovation -- go to Browse by Category / Bathrooms / Pink Bathrooms -- for lots and lots more images including pink and brown, pink and green, pink and blue, etc. Congrats on the new 1967 house! <p> Charlotte Stevens-Fields on January 10th, 2010 3:32 pm <p> This is a fabulous resource ; thanks so much for all your hard work on it! I 'm a reader from Germany who is looking to preserve and restore the fabtastic pink bathroom in my grandparents ' former apartment. Good to know others are on the same wavelength. <p> Jeanmarie on January 11th, 2010 10:51 am <p> Bought my 1965 ranch in March ' 09, perfect pink/white small floor tiles -- the typical kind, pink tub, toilet and sink. All in great condition, and would never consider ripping it out. Today though, am taking down the green flowery wallpaper from the previous owner. Am finding pepto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go up, but am all about the retro/modern/fun and funky 60? s. Love the comments!

Weaver on January 12th, 2010 1:38 am <p> my boyfriend and i are remodleing our house in all things 1950s including the bathrooms. front bath is going to be grey and pink and our masterbath is going to be pink aswell! i pledge to never change and keep it that way forever!!!!!!! <p> Aimee on January 12th, 2010 9:23 am <p> This week I am moving into a home with pink a bathroom... I love it. I am looking forward to making it a little treasured time warp. I pledge to uphold the integrity of the 50? s pink bathroom era. I ca n't wait to see to it come together. <p> Ann P. on January 12th, 2010 11:55 am <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- just as long as the toilet behaves itself( an ongoing issue). It makes for a perfect " master bath " for my wee mid-1960s ranch, IMHO, and my Virgin Mary nightlight feels right at home. <p> RoadRunner on January 13th, 2010 2:14 pm <p> If I ever get a pink bathroom, I promise to save it! Meanwhile, I am doing my best to save a friend 's time capsule 50? s house with an aqua bathroom. <p> janis on January 13th, 2010 10:58 pm <p> I 'm so happy to have found fellow pinksters. <p> Queenvalerie on January 14th, 2010 5:48 pm <p> we just bought our 1959 ranch in Knoxville with our luscious pink bathroom in the hall and an adorable yellow one in the master bedroom! Have n't been able to do much more than clean for now, but I ca n't wait to get in there and renovate. the tub, sink and commode are all pink ; as well as the floor, tub surround and half way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new white medicine cabinet but I will probably be replacing that soon enough. Planning on a 50s and 60s mod London theme all in black and white. Ca n't wait! <p> Kris on January 15th, 2010 9:56 am <p> I have a pink bathroom in a 1955 house. Pink tile counters, pink tile walls and tub surround, and pink tiled floor. Makes me feel pretty. The fixtures are white, though, and I 'm happy about that. <p> Barb on January 16th, 2010 10:47 am <p> Pink In Minnesota. we drove 5 hours yesterday to save a pink bathroom set. I ran across this webite while searching ideas for the 50? s house we are putting together. My 1st choice when we moved in was for a pink kitchen but this site inspired me to go all out after finding this bathroom set. The sink I got is interesting as it is a pedestal with not only chrome legs but a chrome towel bar that attaches to the front of the sink. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait until spring to have it all installed but I 'll spend the rest of the winter searching for tiles &; fabric to put it all together. Thanks for the inspiration. Barb <p> Todd and Jackie Suess on January 16th, 2010 9:51 pm <p> We just bought a house in Port Angeles WA and much to our children 's dismay have decided to have fun with the pink bathroom. YES, we are keeping the pink wall mounted toilet, pink sink and pink tub... why not? It will be so much fun. The vanity is all wrong so any suggestions for that would be greatly appreciated. The home was built in the early 60? s so we want to stay with that era. Ca n't wait to move and get started!! <p> Tom Alvary on January 16th, 2010 11:29 pm <p> Five years ago I bought a 1956 split-level house in White Plains, NY from the original owner for whom it was built. She lived in it for 49 years. It still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original linoleum floor, pink formica countertops, Tappan gas cooktop and oven. How many appliances could you buy today that will work for FIFTY years like the day they were made? The house also has two full pink bathrooms, and a green 1/2 bath. Everything is original, or was until I replaced the sink and toilet( but kept the perfect green tile job) in the 1/2 bath. I 'm going to replace the kitchen floor, sink, dishwasher, and carefully refinish the cabinets, and that 's all in the kitchen. The countertops are still good! I 'm going to have to replace the sink and toilet in the master bath, repair the tile job, and replace the mirror cabinet. I will use white fixtures there because there is enough pink in the custom tiled shower, but I also need to replace the sink, mirror cabinet and vanity cabinet in the other full bath. I 'm keeping the pink tile job, pink tub and pink toilet, so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sensitively done, and by me personally. I have an unmolested 1956 home, and I 'm not about to " update " or " improve " its style- only the function where I absolutely have to do something. So... if anyone has a pink bathroom sink around the NY metro area, please let me know. Mid-Century forever... Tom <p> jim on January 17th, 2010 1:04 am <p> I have a pink bathroom in my 1941 house, was in the middle of remodeling the bathroom when my daughter found this website. Now she wants to " save The Pink Bathroom " and I am with her. We want to restore the house to the period it was built and its great to see other people devoted to the same. This is a part of true Americana. <p> Liz Blaska on January 18th, 2010 10:38 pm <p> I am moving into my parents 1941 743 sq ft bungalow. It has a pink and white bathroom and after enjoying your website for the past several months I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- vinyl/2x2 squares. Looks darling with the 4x4 pink and white tiles. Thanks you so much.... I am loving this!!! <p> JCondon on January 19th, 2010 1:08 pm <p> I pledge to save the pink bathrooms!! We bought our mid-century ranch about two years ago. It was a bit of a fixer upper, so we have been giving it a much needed face lift while still preserving a lot of the original character and charm. With plans of completely gutting and remodeling the original pink bathroom, I 've convinced my husband that I can make the pink work. Once I am done restoring and preserving our pink bathroom, I truly believe it will be saved as long as the house is still standing. Pink bathrooms live on! <p> Erica on January 21st, 2010 3:16 pm <p> This is too funny! I am the reluctant owner of a pink and blue 1956 bathroom. The floor has the tiny blue mosiac tiles, the tub, toilet, and sink are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bubblegum pink with a maroon border. Or should I say WERE tiled, because we 're in the process of removing them as I write this. Sorry, pink bathroom lovers, but we had to choose either the blue or the pink, and the blue was just in better shape. Glad to see there are people out there who enjoy pink bathroom, though! <p> When I bought my 1951 ranch style house in 2006 there were no light fixtures, or sinks, or toilets in it! The previous owners had lost it to the bank, and stripped it as they left. But not before they had done a whole Victorian makeover. The bathroom had faux beadboard wainscot on the walls, and a new one foot square beige tile floor -- boring. With my ever inquiring mind in gear, I decided to see that was under that masonite beadboard -- and what to my wondering eyes should appear but four walls of original pink plastic tile with black cap tiles! Oh my God! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some of the pink tile -- but I saved them all) Next trip up to Minneapolis, I stopped at my favorite home salvage outlet -- The Reuse Ctr -- and found a pink 50? s Universal Rundle toilet, and a pink American Standard wall hung sink. In they went, and I 'm " pretty in pink ". Later though, at the same place, I got " the best of the best " a pink Crane Criterion sink, and a friend gave me a set of period chrome legs for it- I 'm happy <p> Hillary on January 22nd, 2010 12:38 am <p> When we first bought our 1949 ranch, I was n't so fond of the pink tile bathroom. It did n't help that it was wallpapered above with a clashing floral. However, once I stripped off the wallpaper and painted the upper walls a nice, clean white, it actually grew on me. There 's a maroon border and a pink/maroon wave accent and almost every tile is in perfect shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom is in no danger! <p> Abby Dean on January 22nd, 2010 11:20 pm <p> Consider my pink bathroom preserved! While it is a small space -- it is has large personality! At only 5? x 5? we made this tiny space feel larger by painting the walls and ceiling a rich cocoa brown -- with random pink polka dots of differnet colors. We think it is a fun and fresh retro interpretation. We love our pink polks dot bathroom and vow to preserve it for the next 50 years... and our blue and grey tile bathrooms will maintain their original splendor too, as long as I am the owner of this fab ' 50? s home! <p> When we bought our first home 20 years ago, the bathroom was the first thing I updated. The previous owners retiled the bathtub enclosure white tile and was a big selling point on buying the house. I immediatley painted it a pale pink added a black mini blind and excesories and a hot pink counter top to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and have never changed it. Every one tells me how much they like my pink bathroom except my mother-in-law, who when she first saw it said " oh I hate your bathroom! " That does n't surprise me. <p> Gina Lawrence on January 25th, 2010 8:59 pm <p> I have a confession to make. We recently purchased our 1940? s home in St. Louis and the second I took one look at the pink bathroom I knew I would rip it out. I started doing research on ways to take the old tile out the day we closed on the house. While doing my research I came across this site and fell in love with the history and individual stories of the pink bathrooms. I now feel honored to have a pink bathroom. I 'm excited about jazzing up my bathroom and could use your help. My colors are pink and baby blue. I have to say this not the best combination but I will do my best. Thanks for converting me! I pledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February 2nd, 2010 4:38 pm <p> I began looking for a house after my divorce, when I walked into the foyer of my 1948 house, I felt like I was ' home ' -- without even taking a look at anything. BUT when I went upstairs and walked into the bathroom of pink tile, I was sold! My Grandmother 's house had a pink bathroom and I grew up just loving it -- and now I have one of my very own. While everyone thinks its hideous, I LOVE it and pledge to keep it intact as long as I live there. There needs to be some repair work, so I am glad to have found a resource where I can buy more pink tile. <p> I do n't own a home with a pink bathroom but I pledge my support to anyone who does! I love the color pink and I love pink bathrooms. Keep the Pink!! <p> Anne on February 3rd, 2010 7:49 pm <p> We bought a 1959 Skyline mobile home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a park on a lake in Florida. It was already in great shape, but you could see the various decades in the decor. We 've been refurbishing it in 1950? s as closely as we possibly can. Most things have come from ebay -- others from antique stores. Very little is reproduction. We are now working on the bathroom, which has a pink sink, toilet and bathtub! We are protecting them you can bet your life! The kitchen also has a pink sink! When we get it all finished, I 'll have to submit our story and pictures. I LOVE PINK BATHROOMS! <p> Janet on February 3rd, 2010 9:34 pm <p> I only wish I had a pink bathroom, however a man friend of mine does have one in his downtown apartment. It is pure 50? s, and as he has come to find out, a rarity in his building. Jealous. Totally jealous. <p> I grew up in a home that was built in the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom. It was amazing. I went back to see it in 2008 and that pink bathroom looked good as new-everything was perfect. The downstairs bath was yellow and black, but I loved the pink bath the best. I wanted to buy that house but it did n't work out <p> Sadly I do not own a pink bathroom but I will do all I can to encourage preservation of any I see! I feel in love with pink in 1980 when I bought my first Lacoste polo in pink! <p> I have been smitten with pink for years! <p> K Elaine on February 7th, 2010 3:43 pm <p> I am a soon-to-be owner of a pink bathroom in a 1956 ranch. The tiles appear gray and pink, matching the original floor. The original potty and sink and bath are white. <p> I just saw a commercial on TV where they demo-ing a pink bathroom. Nothing against modern bathrooms, but I see nothing wrong with my pink bathroom. And after I freshen and highlight the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great conversation starter with any visitor to my new first home. :) <p> My first home( purchased in 1993) was a 1955 era twin, two-story, airlite house in Philadelphia and it also had a pink and gray bathroom color scheme. <p> I seem to be drawn to the pink and gray bathroom. <p> You got ta love the 1950s. <p> JillS on February 8th, 2010 10:39 am <p> We have a 1952 ranch home and just finished restoring our bathroom this weekend. It is pink and chrome and beautiful. From the Nutone exhaust fan to the pink walls to the vintage 40? s sink... we 've brought the traditional look back! I 'd love to submit photos. <p> I do n't have a pink bathroom at the moment -- but I support the movement to save the pinks. Think pink!!! <p> Keri on February 10th, 2010 6:36 pm <p> I almost hired a contractor today to demolish the pink tile. But then I thought, hey, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So there you go. I think the value is in a preserved piece of history, not in a mass-produced bathroom vanity from the Home Depot. <p> maureen on February 10th, 2010 8:35 pm <p> I have a pink 1950? s bathroom was thinking for years to take it out until I found this website. i will keep my pink bathroom now <p> Jessica on February 12th, 2010 7:30 pm <p> keep the pink! <p> laura on February 13th, 2010 10:11 am <p> My neighbors house was an exact mirror image replica of ours as a kid. They got the pink bathroom though. Ours was green. I loved that pink bathroom. I hope it 's still there! I pledge to never pull out the pink! <p> Aimee Hendrix on February 13th, 2010 2:16 pm <p> I ca n't stand it when I see them ripping up the pink bathrooms on HGTV! I have to change the channel. My bathroom is technically peach but I painted everything around it pinky peach so I could call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hammond on February 16th, 2010 5:46 pm <p> I LOVE pink bathrooms especially vintage <p> and i miss the old fashioned deep bath tubs. Modern bath tubs are ridiculously small both in depth and length... i so miss stretching out and being right under the water in the old baths. We stayed at an old hotel a little while back and i got to have a nice bath ; that was the best part of staying at the hotel. I then made it up for my teenage son who i had been telling him how much i loved the old baths... so he got to try it out and fell in love with old baths too. He said why do they put those stupid new baths in that are too small when we could all be soaking in these big deep baths. Luxury <p> Deborah Ecklund on February 16th, 2010 11:05 pm <p> My husband &; I have our fingers crossed on purchasing a 1959 house with... you guessed it, a pink bathroom! These folks were definitely into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Second bedroom -- sky blue. Outside of the house -- sky blue. Bathroom? Large pink tiles with sky blue tile trim. While all the pink gets alittle overwhelming, I do have grande envisionments of putting down either an all-white " pinwheel " tile floor, or perhaps one with bits of pink and sky blue randomly scattered. Does the hexagon/honeycomb tile style work? Or is that too pre-1950? ish? The pink is a bit much, but I 'm not going to tear it down. Works perfectly good for me. Adding white on the floor &; walls will " lessen " the pink haze...... Any suggestions?( oh, PS -- the sink is white, but the toilet is sky BLUE! Guess the previous lady of the house had to make SOME kind of concession......) Deb <p> We have two pink bathrooms in our new " old " house, a full bath and a half bath and my husband picked the color in both rooms. He grew up in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jan Armstrong on February 21st, 2010 1:44 am <p> Once I had an extravagant AuntieMame-type Auntie who commissioned a black sunken bath tub for her ultra- modern home. After just one use, she had it ripped out. Why? Because she felt like she was laying in a coffin and the bath water looked grey! Now, pink is flattering to any skin colour -- you 'll always look your best in pink. Plus it 's cheerful, so puts you in a good mood for the day -- and last thing at night. <p> Cathy on February 21st, 2010 7:35 pm <p> Should I ever be fortunate enough to have a pink bathroom, I would protect it with my life. The house I grew up in the 60? s had two bathrooms ; one pink and one avocado green, so I have fond memories.

I cried when my brother remodeled the house, taking away all that lovely pink. I just remodeled one of our bathrooms in our 1927 home and I put in a retro pink and black bathroom.

We 've lived in a 1869 Victorian in NJ for over 23 yrs. and have not had the time or money to renovate our full bath upstairs. It was last renovated by the previous owner in 1963 and is very pink, wall tiles, tub, toilet, shower.

Any suggestions for decorating would really be appreciated.

Not everybody likes that look, but I do, and I 'm heartened to know I 'm not alone. My wife was n't initially as crazy about them as I am, but she 's come around, and I 'm happy to report that we intend to leave them alone... though we would like to do *something* about the worn tile floor in the hall bath. <p> I hate pink! But I pledge to save the pink and other Jazz Age bathroom fixtures from destruction. My uncle and aunt bought a 50s ranch last year and I convinced them to save their intact pink fixtures. The bathroom had suffered a bad remodel so they updated it with chocolate browns and taupes to work with the existing pink fixtures. It turned out great!( I also am harboring a lavender pedestal sink in my basement for a future project) <p> Diana on March 11th, 2010 3:39 pm <p> Hi, I just closed on a 1966 ranch in western Massachusetts. The bathroom is vintage pink and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shower curtain, towels, etc. I am trying a deep fushia to act as a contrast. I would try grey, but those are the colors of my college and I do n't have a very good feeling about my college! I would try white but I have a 13 year old son, a dog and cats and they will be grey before long. Any thoughts? The home has had only one owner since 1966 and now its mine. I am trying to preserve its authenticity but put my own zing into it.( PS I am not afraid of brights and contrasts and my palette can be very wild but I am open to suggestions.) Any tips on colors other than fuschia? I suppose black may work, but that is too maudlin for me. Another question : I need to replace the pink bathroom seat but am finding them only in the $75- $100 range?!?!?! Can this be? Thanks for your thoughts fellow pinkies.

My husband and I are building an add on bathroom off of the master suite we are going to stick with the retro feel of the home by adding all refinished retro Pink Accents, tub, sinks and toilet. We are so looking forward to this project. We feel it will add value to our home as well as keep the wonderful retro vibe! SAVE THE PINK BATHROOM! <p> OK, so my Newly-wedded Husband and I are moving into a house and the full bathroom is... Pink tile with pink sink and pink tub.... My favorite color is pink and Hubby knows it.... The previous owner dicided to wall paper all over above the wall tile, all over the trim and paint the original red stained door white. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butterflies in all sorts of shades, all over it... The pink sink rests in teh white with gold speckled counter top that the kitchen still has... unfortunately the kitchen counter was used also as a cutting board and has a huge stain over it... Going to get an actual cutting board and place it there on the counter to cover sad huge stain... Hopefully stain will start coming out a bit more with lots of good scrubbing, something the previous owner was lacking in doing... I am keeping the pink tile/tub/sink and thinking of going with a soft shade of gray on the walls... changing the toilet seat of course, its white and easy to replace. The half bathroom in the basement( I do n't know why its there) has an original sink in it as well and the white toilet has a blue seat on it... The sink is very original and it has a cute sea shell shaped soap holder on it, The former owner put a strip of wallpaper across the font of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as the rest of the horrible wallpaper that they decided to partially glue to the walls and is somewhat just hanging there... the only wallpaper to be kept is the one in the dining room... the bottom half of the wall has wall paper under the chair railing trim... other wise I have a huge project.... But the pink bathroom stays... I promise!!!! <p> Karen on March 19th, 2010 1:10 pm <p> I pledge to save the pink bathroom, at any cost. My husband and I are hoping to find a home that is being sold " as is, need of upgrading ". If there is a pink bathroom there it will definitely be preserved!! <p> Karen on March 19th, 2010 1:18 pm <p> I pledge allegiance to the pink bathroom and for which it stands! We have a 1940? s bathroom that 's peach, not pink, but a girl can wish, ca n't she? <p> I LOVE this website and i vow to make retro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! <p> Chrissy on March 19th, 2010 1:30 pm <p> I pledge to save the pink bathroom... just wish I had one! <p> Rhonda DeBough on March 19th, 2010 1:37 pm <p> I do n't have a pink bathroom, but I advocate hard when I see one that someone is considering re-decorating. I am however getting my kitchen painted pink as I type! <p> I have a pink bathroom in my 1955 ranch home! I LOVE my pink bathroom. It 's original to the house and I will NEVER ruin it. <p> Rhonda DeBough on March 19th, 2010 1:39 pm <p> Ahhh, pam. please delete my last post. I did n't think it went through... <p> Rebecca Prichard on March 19th, 2010 1:41 pm <p> I have a pink guest bathroom and there is now way in hell I would change it! It was a major factor in buying the home. <p> Keith on March 19th, 2010 1:42 pm <p> Pink is cool. I only wish my bathroom were pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall tile with black accents. I have n't found a successful solution for the walls above the tile yet. Oh and the fixtures are white. And the floor was redone by a previous owner in shiny 12x12 black granite tiles. <p> I long for pink. <p> Linda Blackmore on March 19th, 2010 2:38 pm <p> I live in a mid centruy cottage -- wish it was a modern. I have black and white tile bathroom and I 'd love for it to be a color. It makes me sick to see the " designers " tear out the wonderful old bathrooms. I hate the Pottery Barn makeovers. All the houses look exactly the same with the same colors and everything. UGHHHH!! There was a house hunters yesterday that had the most amazing turquoise stove unit with a round door, and of course, they hated it. Luckily they did n't buy that house, so maybe someone with a brain kept it and redid the kitchen to match the stove. <p> kristen on March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pink bathrooms! i have always loved them and now i am trying to help clean up, renovate, and save the one in my grandfather 's house! <p> James Mitchell on March 19th, 2010 3:07 pm <p> Pink and black in my 1953 bathroom and I would not change it for anything. Thanks for the great website and ideas.... the kitchen is next... pink?!?! <p> My first apartment had a wonderful pink bathroom. It was in a converted mansion in Oakland by Lake Merritt. My husband had a pink bathroom with burgundy trim in his apartment in New York. Pink bathrooms are just the BEST! <p> P.S. Although it works, the clear shower curtain with pink flamingos on it is only 1 of many choices! <p> KittyT on March 19th, 2010 4:56 pm <p> I painted my last room pink and black. My current bathroom is pink and blue -- with flamingos etched into the sliding glass shower doors. It 's AMAZING. I &lt;3 pink! <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, bathtub, toilet and tile, I will NEVER remodel! I will promise to cherish it forever and decorate to enhance it 's pinkness in every way. Deb West aka Zootsuitmama <p> Save the pink bathrooms! I watched one get gutted on HGTV this week... nooooooo! <p> Elizabeth Telzrow on March 20th, 2010 11:41 am <p> We love our pink bathroom. <p> Kirk B on March 20th, 2010 12:08 pm <p> We recently bought a 1955 Custom Ranch in Anaheim CA. The bathroom still had the original pink tub and tile but had been wallpapered with a horrible floral print. We have since removed the paper( nightmare!) and painted the walls a wonderful shade of pink! We refer to it as the " Hollywood Bathroom " because it 's just so fabulous! <p> Oh pink bathroom.... you who made me doubt my design capabilities.... who made me reconsider how much pink can actually go in one space! Your flecked pink tiles with white and blue overtones do n't match your headlining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @.. but no matter! I have great plans for you!!!!! You and I shall be the best of friends! I promise to never curse your name again! <p> Michelle Teall on March 21st, 2010 2:59 pm <p> I pledge my love to you beautiful pink bathrooms of yesterday and today. L'amour, l'amour! <p> Kathie Murphy on March 21st, 2010 5:04 pm <p> I get so sad when I see people ripping out perfectly good pink bathrooms. What is a soaker tub compared to an entire set of porcelain bath appliances( including those cool towel rods, soap dishes, toilet paper holders, etc.) in Mamie pink? If we ever buy a house, a perfectly preserved pink bathroom might just be the thing that tips the scale. <p> Keep up the good work! <p> Roxanne Mason on March 24th, 2010 1:55 pm <p> I vow, until my final breath is taken, to save my pink tile, sink &; tub. I will continue my search to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I will make their lives long and happy beacause of, not only the pleasure they bring into my life but, the beauty they bring into our world. Along with that, I will forever cherish my gray Formica vanity top with the multi-colored boomerag print and the Hobie ring that surrounds my precious sink. My pink tile half bath will share the same pampering that it 's cousin enjoys and will be restored to it 's pinkness if it 's the last thing I do. GOD SAVE THE PINK. <p> Jennifer Mottolese on March 24th, 2010 2:18 pm <p> I 'm so glad the previous owners of my house were too lazy to re-do their pink and black 1954 bathroom. I love it! <p> Brandi on March 24th, 2010 8:50 pm <p> I was terrified of my pink bathroom but now I vow to embrace it! Im so excited for my pink bathroom enhancement project! <p> Lovely Mrs E on March 25th, 2010 3:20 pm <p> I swear if I ever ever EVER get a PINK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it turquoise, too!) I will save it and clean it and cherish it forever and always, and never let the silly people at HGTV touch it. <p> Carole Imes on March 26th, 2010 7:11 am <p> I pledge to save the pink bathroom. As far back as I can remember, in every home where I 've lived I 've had a pink bathroom. <p> Carol on March 26th, 2010 4:15 pm <p> I 'm about to close on a mortgage on a 1950? s bungalow with a pink-tiled, gray-bordered bathroom. I have to say -- I 'm excited about the possibilities of making it pretty! And, the basement also has a pink toilet and sink! <p> Connie Krawz on March 26th, 2010 10:06 pm <p> I came across your site, trying to help my mom out. I grew up in a 50? s house with a beautiful pink and black bathroom, she just had some plumbing done in the bathroom and tiles have to be replaced. She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wonder if there is a place she can find matching pink tiles. I would hate to think she would use just black to patch things up. Are there any websites I can go to? to find matching colors? She lives in NJ. <p> thank you connie krawz <p> Cynthia on March 31st, 2010 8:27 am <p> Did you see the RIP to a pink bathroom in the April 2010 issue of Country Living magazine, p. 68? Painful. <p> 50s Pam on March 31st, 2010 8:30 am <p> Cynthia, see my main site -- Retro Renovation. Up in the blue navigation bar you can Find PRODUCTS -- go to Bathrooms -- then tile -- for our reco 's. Also, in the right hand side of this site you can see a selection of vendors that I have identified who provide products that could be suitable for a pink bathroom renovation or re-creation. Good luck. <p> Sally on March 31st, 2010 9:51 pm <p> We are the 3rd owner of a custom ranch, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glass wall in the hallway. The shower wall needs to be repaired, and we almost considered replacing the tub and walls, but once I found this website, we reconsidered. We now pledge to save our pink bathroom! <p> Meri Byers on April 8th, 2010 12:45 pm <p> I bought a house built in 1959 with the original pink/grey bathroom that came complete with crazy-cool poppy wallpaper that has silver accents, and pink beaded " curtains " over the window. Pink kitchen too. ; 0) <p> I have two pink full baths in my mid-century home and I love them! The smaller one off the master bedroom is pink and white while the other bath is pink with pale, pale yellow tiles. Both have in-wall, functioning heaters. Years ago my neighbor came to a garage sale held at this home and bought a pink toilet that matches the tiles in the smaller bathroom -- and yes, the unused toilet was( and still is) in its original box. It resides in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I will soon be installing it. Both baths are full of light no matter the time of day and because they are so bright, it is easy to keep them sparkling clean. <p> Lee Brusky on April 10th, 2010 7:05 pm <p> I recently bought a ranch style house that was built in ' 68. It happens to have a pink bathroom. And not just pink tile either. It also has a pink tub, sink and toilet. I am not a huge fan of pink but I would like to keep at least the tile due to cost of remodeling the whole bathroom. I was thinking of doing the rest of the bathroom in black and white but was told this is very 50? s. Also did I mention I am 28 years old. Any tips on a remodel that would still keep the pink tiles on the walls? <p> Nancy on April 11th, 2010 12:33 am <p> Although our bathroom has boring tan tile and white tub and such, before we even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flaming pink flamingo curtains, wallpaper border, etc. The house is a 1917 Mennonite 4-square. I am on a never-ending prowl for affordable pink toilet, sink and tub. The rest of the house is rife with mid-century stuff, too. My husband and I can not bear to watch home shows because they say such horrid things about old bathrooms. Yes, save the pink( and yellow and lavender...) bathroom!!! <p> janice on April 14th, 2010 9:13 am <p> Stumbling across this info. may save my sanity from the pink bathroom. Thankyou, Thankyou! <p> Sarah on April 14th, 2010 1:52 pm <p> I wish more than anything that I had a pink bathroom. To waste a pink bathroom is to crush my dreams. Please preserve our mcm heritage <p> I do nt have a pink bathroom, but my mom does! And hers looks just like the background on this website with the black trim. I am taking the pledge for her! She does not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is. <p> Tamara on April 14th, 2010 11:17 pm <p> My husband and I are going to start renovating old homes very soon, and we hope to preserve many pink bathrooms as well as bathrooms of other colors! We hope to preserve ALL original features of each of the homes we work on, and if any features are missing we hope to replace them with as close to original as possible. <p> Message to Lee : keep ALL of the pink features of your bathroom! I swear, in several years you will come to appreciate them. If you rip anything out now, you will regret it later. Become a preservationist, I guarantee you will enjoy it the more you get into it. <p> Mrs. Pitcher on April 16th, 2010 3:39 pm <p> I also pledge. I will be moving into a house with TWO pink bathrooms and will do my utmost to keep both of them in the wonderful mint condition they are in. One of mine looks just like the background, too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle pattern. <p> Jennifer on April 18th, 2010 8:06 pm <p> I just purchased my dream home and the stuff of my dreams was indeed the big pink bathroom with both a pink tiled tub and shower -- heavenly! <p> Thanks for the tribute to pink bathrooms! <p> Sydney on April 20th, 2010 12:40 am <p> HELP HELP!!! Inexpierenced decorator who HATES the pink bathroom!! ITS VERY SMALL... but unlike most I have seen so far, it is not trimmed in the lovely black..... it is trimmed in a burgundy/maroon. The floor in a checkerboard of maroon and pick. The walls and shower are all pink with one row of burgundy/maroon tile as the border. PLEASE HELP ME!!!! The " victorian roses " look is NOT a favorite. Im begging you experts! I reluctantly pledge to keep the pink bathroom! <p> Sydney on April 20th, 2010 12:43 am <p> Anyone catch the bathroom in Steel Magnolias?( Remember the beginning before the wedding when Julia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!!!! Adds new meaning to the movies signiture colors of " blush and bashful! " YIKES!! <p> Through the discovery of this site I have learned to love my pink bathroom that is in my Victorian brownstone. I need suggestions for a ceiling light. The tub, sink, tile and floor are all pink. We are painting the walls powder blue( one day I 'd like to do a retro wall paper.) The ceiling is high. Suggestions for a ceiling light? <p> Another alternative : How about a vintage chandelier... or a toleware chandelier? Especially if there is no white in your trim? <p> Barbara on April 21st, 2010 9:45 am <p> Thanks for the reply, Pam, and I will definitely look for your suggestions!. The door and the ceiling will be white. The Victorian townhouse was built in 1905 but there must have been a remodeling in the 50? s and 60? s because much of the house had wallpaper, tile, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I 'm afraid we recognized the value of some of the fixtures too late to save from deterioration, but we are determined to preserve the pink retro style bathroom. We are also trying to blend the Victorian architecture of the rest of the house with the midcentury style furniture that we have grown to appreciate. <p> I am addicted to your website! <p> 50s Pam on April 21st, 2010 10:03 am <p> Hi Barbara, if the bathroom is 50s -- then I think you can also just do a chrome-base light fixture. Hey, why do n't you look for something vintage -- see what the retro decorating gods send to you. Just make sure to have it rewired. <p> Joan on April 21st, 2010 4:20 pm <p> We added on to a 1950 Googie style house. In the original master bedroom there was a large closet that was labelled " nursery " on the original plans. We turned it into a bathroom. My husband answered an ad for a pink sink and toilet( our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and the guy said you can have it for $25 if you take it out. He did and we have a great old sink with cabinet. Then we installed a walk-in pink shower with a glass block window. The tile is from B &N; in Gardenia. They are awesome. No question on colors -- there are only specific ones they ever made so matching is easy. They do have 2 pinks, one is like bubble gum and one is more coral but those are the only two. Needless to say our sink matched perfectly( as did the blue vintage sink in the other bath). All over our house, we went with the ' landlord special " fixtures available at Home Depot, etc. Some things just never change so they were all classic( and cheap!). Hooray for the pledge -- Viva la pink! <p> Janna on April 22nd, 2010 3:52 pm <p> I love this site! I have three young co-workers who have recently purchased homes with pink bathrooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! <p> Adrienne on April 22nd, 2010 9:01 pm <p> I have lived in my little old house, with my little old pink bathroom for 20 years. All the pink tile flooring, toilet, sink, tub is original. To compliment all that pink, the walls are painted a bright pepto pink and the accessories are pink as well. I never considered having anything but a pink bathroom and I could never understand why anyone would n't want a pink bathroom. Until now, I thought that I was the only person in the world that appreciated my pink bathroom. I feel totally vindicated. Viva la pink bathrooms!! <p> Mary Engelhard on April 24th, 2010 4:33 pm <p> Finally! I had no idea that there were other like minded folks who could not bear to damage an Americana piece of art.. My 1950s pink bathroom was way before its time with a Garden Tub and the beautiful maroon trim pieces, Might have to get some of that flamingo wallpaper....... <p> Amy Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in maintaining a house 's period architechture, keeping it as original as possible. <p> I think pink bathrooms are the cat 's meow! <p> janet speier on May 2nd, 2010 5:29 pm <p> my pink bathroom is lovely and if i have to make changes i will only improve it <p> Dana Brockert on May 9th, 2010 2:41 pm <p> We just bought our first home! Complete with a beautiful pink bathroom! <p> My husband and I just recently purchased a 1831 Armory House in Historic Harpers Ferry, WV. We have a pink bathroom( toilet, sink, bathtub all pink, white tiles on the wall, a 1950? s medicine cabinet) We decided to embrace the pink! <p> We have a pedestal sink with chrome legs and towel bars( American Standard) and want to remove the legs to replace the flooring and then put them back on or buy new. After floor install the legs will need to be shorter, we think??. Any suggestions on how to remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11th, 2010 11:15 am <p> Cassie, look to see if there is an adjustment you can make where the legs meet the sink. You can also look there to see how they screw on.... P.S. See my main blog http : //retrorenovation.com/ for a source for new -- but I think w/towel bars is very difficult to find, and expensive. <p> Erin on May 11th, 2010 4:54 pm <p> After much debate, my pink bathroom stays! I have pink tile running floor to 4?, so I chose a smoky grey for the wall and a dark glossy brown for the trim. Next step is to add tin ceiling tiles! <p> I love pink bathrooms! My great grandmother had a GORGEOUS one in Houston. I still remember every little bit of it, even though I have n't seen it since I was a teenager. I sent my mom a link to your site and this was her reply( that I agree with 100%) : <p> I know!!!! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bathroom needs " updating ". Hate it, hate it. They do n't just replace the old tub and sink, etc., they get sledge hammers and smash it to pieces( for shock value). <p> They " kill " a pink or aqua bathroom at least once a week! What are they thinking. Those things are over 50 years old... there is value in things that old. <p> GOOD LUCK IN YOUR QUEST TO SAVE THE PINK BATHROOM! <p> Hilary on May 13th, 2010 2:49 pm <p> I recently bought a 1958 concrete block ranch with a bad 80? s renovation job. I found a pink toilet &; sink( 3 sinks) and drove 2-1/2 hours each way to pick them up! White by design, not by default! They 're not yet installed. I got sink legs at DEA Bath.

I am painting and decorating right now and I love your site for inspiration! <p> Derinda Green on May 15th, 2010 5:03 pm <p> Just stumbled upon your website. Quite interesting! Just wanted to let everyone know that my family and I moved into a house that was built in 1973. It 's a 5 bedroom, 5 bath ranch. Each bathroom has a different color tub and sink. The master bath is blue, then the others are green, pink, a light brown and gold. The light brown bath is not a tub, but a shower stall. Two of the bathroom sinks are unique. The pink one looks like something used to wash your hair. It 's long and slanted and one end with a water sprayer attached. Then there 's the green one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soap dispenser. <p> I love pink bathrooms, especially the ones that are pink and black.I cringe when I see them tearing apart old bathrooms on t.v.... Our house was built in 1937 but was " renovated " around 1989 so they have stolen all the charm the house undoubtedly was built with and replaced it with fake marble black stick down tiles, and popcorn ceilings bleh. Ca n't wait to tear it out and make it old again, and possibly pink <p> melissa cash on May 17th, 2010 11:03 pm <p> We just bought a 50? s home and will work with the pink/black tile and are looking for original peices to bring back to the patially remodled bathroom! <p> I am horrified when I see a decorating show rip out a pink bathroom!

My grandmother 's bathroom in her 1913 bungalow was hot pink and black. To me, pink is a perfect color for a bathrooom.

It 'll look real nice. Me :( dying a little inside) I think you 'll find that restoration is more eco-friendly and there is a growing movement to preserve the magic of the pink bathroom. We have a 1955 Atomic Ranch and I think granite would be inappropriate. There 's this website... <p> And that is my pledge! Um, and if anyone knows anyone in the SF Bay Area who can refinish a pink sink for less than $750, please let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3rd, 2010 12:56 pm <p> Cindy on July 14th, 2010 7:41 pm <p> We bought our home 3 years ago and even though it is only 22 years old I was a bit surprised with the pink tiled bathroom. I assumed I would gut it... but I am a changed woman! I pledge to save it. Honestly, only the tile on the wall is pink and a pale shade at that. I have so many ideas thanks to this website that I am giddy with excitement! <p> michelle buehrer on July 22nd, 2010 10:26 pm <p> We recently purchased a home with a pink bathroom. Sadly, it is not in very good shape but we will try our best to bring it back to life. It is one of the many things we love about the home.

LOVE your sites! <p> Kim on July 25th, 2010 10:55 pm <p> Ok, I will keep my pink bathroom -- pink tiles, pink tub, pink sinks and pink toilet( which by the way is a special size and can be only special ordered if I wanted to replace it anyway). BUT, can I have some ideas for decorating? I currently have a splash of black. I do like black and pink so that works, but it has 1950? s brown vanity. Could I paint them black to make it retro or would that look stupid? HELP! Oh, and I love the site. Now I know why it 's pink. <p> I wish that I had a pink bathroom to save! I love all of those pastel bathroom fixtures. I have an older home( 1947) but unfortunately the bathroom was redone in the 70s. <p> Jaime on July 27th, 2010 9:57 am <p> I just painted my halfbath pink. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it white.

Colors?? <p> I have a lovely 50? s era pink tile bathroom with burgundy border that 's oh so retro.

While I am not lucky enough to have a pink bathroom myself, a number of my friends own homes with pink bathrooms.

I am totally sick of this granite trend. I LOVE pink bathrooms! The first bathroom I remember wan pink! Mid century decor is lovely classic and functional! It should be saved and replicated! Why this fascination with Victorian homes? Real ones are nice but are generally dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surfaces and palladium windows are tired dwellings that are remnants of the bling and conspicuous consumption of the last century. They are so tired and so OVER. We are buying a mid century home in an inexpensive but beautiful old rust belt city. Our house to be has a pink and gray tiled bath. There is no way that I will ever distroy this pink bath! the other bathroom was redone -- but I intend to find pictures from the former owner and restore it to it 's former glory! <p> Janet LaFlesch on August 17th, 2010 12:30 pm <p> I live in the home my father and mother built in 1951. The front bathroom is green lav, toilet and shower. Back bathroom is light pink( salmon) and blue around the blue lav with same blue toilet and bath.

I had the soap dish before I had the bathroom or the shower curtain( which has now been discontinued, I got it just in time!), I ca n't believe my luck in getting such a nicely coordinated bathroom in my first apartment after leaving university housing. My pink bathroom is the shining star of my apartment. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the whole 1951 house.

How do i keep it clean, and restore the glaze? <p> 50s Pam on August 27th, 2010 5:29 pm <p> Hi Barbara, my sites are not DIY or fixit sites.

The pink tub and tile( which I had at first planned to scrap) is in such good condition and I 've really grown to love it. Unfortunately the sink, counter and toilet have been replaced with hideous cheap " upgrades ". And an truly awful fake beige " tile " floor. So I 'll have to do some creative restoration.

I 'm a bit keen on possibly taking some of the fixtures back a decade or so. It 's small and it 's pink and grey tile floor, pink tub, sink and toilet and those will either remain or I will replace with the same color and same period. The rest : wall color types of cabinets and fixtures are up for grabs.It 's a small space... any ideas? <p> Lisa on September 19th, 2010 6:43 am <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom. The former owner had covered much of the pink tile with a fiberglass shower surround. I was so excited to pull it away to find the pink tile in perfect condition! I just picked out some amazing hex tile to put on the floor. <p> This bathroom is going to be hip! <p> 50s Pam on September 19th, 2010 8:07 am <p> Hi Susan, head over to RetroRenovation.com, my main site. There is a whole category of Pink Bathroom posts( under Bathrooms : Pink Bathrooms) that should give you a lot of ideas. Good luck! <p> Star on September 20th, 2010 5:44 pm <p> I pledge. Only because I honestly do n't have the money to truely renovate. So I pledge to make the most with what I have and hope that I come up with a decent batheroom. I think it is neat to be creative, but to be quite honest, I ca n't believe pink was ever a fad. <p> Susan on September 21st, 2010 1:55 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am struggling!

I will never change either one of them. Just need to find a pink sink to replace the ugly fake marble one that a previous owner put in. <p> Christina on September 23rd, 2010 2:42 pm <p> We just purchased a home that has the classic pink tile and blue tub, sink and toilet... all in perfect condition. My first thougts were to rip it out and start fresh. However, I absolutely adore it now and would n't change it for the world. I have decorated it with lots of antique white and made it very shabby. I have gotten so many compliments from people who originally saw the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1st thing we HAD to was REDO the bathroom. Now they have come to love it too. We are also sporting the PINK TILE in the kitchen which will also stay. I just love it. Embrace the PINK bathroom. I take the pledge to save MY PINK BATHROOM. <p> Jennifer on September 26th, 2010 5:34 pm <p> I have a powder room on the main floor of the home we recently purchased. The pink tile is awesome( of course), but the floor is anything but. I wish I knew how to revamp the pink bathroom while working with brown/black ceramic mosaic tile floors. <p> Nevertheless, I take the pledge to save my pink bathroom! <p> Kara on September 29th, 2010 1:20 pm <p> I love my pink bathroom. We 're doing a few things to it now, but keeping the tile. <p> Pamela Sue Burg on October 1st, 2010 8:26 pm <p> We all need a pink bathroom, especially in these confusing, troubling times. Nothing is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I rent a townhouse and my little haven of pink heaven only exists in my memory and black &; white photos of my childhood home. Thank you all for paying homage to the ultimate icon of good old-fashioned sensibility with just a touch of silliness! <p> Suzanne Cleveland on October 17th, 2010 11:50 am <p> I have lived in my house since 1977( builit in 1931) with a pink tile bathroom wall w/ grey tile trim, and a tile floor of 2 shades of pink tile and grey tile.. When I bought the house, I was told to change it BUT I did n't and I am so glad to find this link!!! I decided to be PROUD of pink and not try to ' subdue ' it, but to have it scream out loud!!! And it does!! I have lots of framed photos and/or small paintings in the bathroom, all with pink in them. My most recent is a photo of my newly born ' pink ' grandson. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hey everyone! We are renting a house built in 1961 with original EVERYTHING. It 's so cute! The kitchen is my favorite part though, it is solid sea foam. The walls, the appliances, even the matching GE metal cupboards are sea foam! Unfortunately this house has been a rental unit for at least a decade and I 'm pretty sure almost all of the past tenants have been college kids with questionable housekeeping habits. I have already scrubbed the vomit splatter off of the walls and doors leading to the bathroom and I 've almost completely restored the toilet but my favorite part, the kitchen, continually foils me. There is massive buildup on the cupboards and appliances but the finish is too delicate for today 's harsh cleaners. I have tried several different things( including just dish soap and water) and had the green start rubbing off. The spots where I have tried to clean have also lost most of their shine. Please help! Nobody in my family ever had this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. My neurosis demands a clean kitchen, but my love of retro says do n't you dare ruin that finish! Please, save me( and my kitchen) from myself! <p> Taralyn on October 18th, 2010 9:33 am <p> When we first bought our 1962 ranch, I hated the pink bathroom! But thanks to this website, I have grown to love it! There is some water damage behind the tiles, but I 'm determined to find an exact match to keep the retro vibe of our awesome home! I 'm also determined to find Boomerang Formica in the Bianco color!( without paying an arn and leg for it!) So, I wholeheartedly pledge to save my pink bathroom!( And my brown/mint green one, too!) <p> Linda Whaley-Crowley on October 18th, 2010 4:48 pm <p> I do not have a pink bathroom, but this something I would do if I was able to remodel. Love it. It is part of my childhood. Horay for the PINK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on October 19th, 2010 10:44 pm <p> We have lived in our 1961 tri-level for 12 years. I have never loved my pink( upstairs) bathroom but thanks to your website, I am seeing it in a whole new light. We 've changed a few minor things( removed 80? s-era wallpaper, updated fraying-cord light fixtures, de-flowered the built-in planter, painted the vanity) but the peachy-pink essence of it remains. If I had ever had the funds for it, it would 've been gutted in a heartbeat. But after looking at hundreds of photos of pink bathrooms I can honestly say, mine 's not too bad! I think I 'll keep it. <p> 50s Pam on October 19th, 2010 10:48 pm <p> sweeter word never spoken, julie! <p> Meghan on October 20th, 2010 2:35 am <p> I pledge to have a pink bathroom in my home, when I move out of Mom and Pop 's, and buy my own place! &lt;3 <p> LeeAnn on October 24th, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1922 but complete with an authentic 50? s pink and black bathroom.

I said this before I found this site and I even thought I was nuts!!! I feel better now... strength in numbers! Wish me luck as I begin to restore it and clean it up!!! <p> Adrienne on October 25th, 2010 5:57 pm <p> I am the proud owner of a pink bathroom, and because I 'm installing a shower in with the tub, I am actually putting more pink tile in my bathroom. I 'm just so happy to have found your website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That ' Bathtastic ' show on DYI that always disses then annihilates pink bathrooms, only to put in something trendy in drab colors, apparently is n't on the cutting edge. Anyone who watches ' Parenthood ' on NBC will notice that one couple 's bathroom has pink tile( and a green pedestal sink -- fabulous). And an honorable mention should go to ' Dexter ' for his and the dearly-departed Rita 's aqua, yellow and black tile bathroom. In about another year or two the world will catch on and then pink will prevail! <p> Sixcatsncountin on October 25th, 2010 8:33 pm <p> I am holding my head up proud once again..... We will pledge to keep our 1955 pink( and hospital green) bathroom intact and not pretend we do n't have indoor plumbing when guests come. You have given us back our sense of dignity and purpose.

One is retro pink ; the other original to this 1910 house. I need replacement tile for the pink bath. It 's sort of salmon/pink and embossed on the back with : AMERICAN S-3619 MADE IN AMERICA Can anyone help me identify this tile maker? Does anyone have any of this tile? Thanks a million. <p> Susan on November 4th, 2010 2:47 pm <p> Just bought a 1948 house with a pink bathroom and have decided to embrace the pink! It also has a yellow and brown ceramic tiled kitchen.

When we first started looking, we knew that we wanted a 50? s home with all it 's original beauty in tack. Not only is our soon to be home all original, but it was owned by it 's 1 &; only original owner since it 's built in 1955! And YES, with a beautiful PINK BATHROOM! Along with a YELLOW one too!! I love this site &; the retro renovation one as well ; I must say that it has given me SO MANY ideas for our home, and I 'm on pins &; needles to get started. Thank you for all the ideas &; information that I will definitely be using. <p> Kevi on November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declare my commitment to my new-to-me pink bathroom. I will redo the loose tiles, get better flooring, and figure out how to make the ugliness under the pink-tiled vanity go away... so help me Maime. <p> I have a pink bathroom in my 1964 suburban house. After a bit of berry colored paint, and black on the cabinetry, it became one of the best rooms in the house. Changing the light fixture helped enormously too. I will definitely save the pink. <p> I gladly commit to saving pink bathrooms. My poor 1920? s house was stripped to the studs by someone with very odd taste. The bathroom was 4? x 8? with the sink in the LR. At a neighbors garage sale, I found a Crane pink toilet and sink in pristine condition. Thus started my pink bathroom renovation. The toilet got refitted, I mixed paint to match it for the walls, but could n't find any brackets for the sink. It 's in the garage. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm happy with my pink bathroom, looking forward tothe next stage of PINK. Thanks for a great idea! <p> I pledge to save the pink bathrooms! We just bought our first home, and were so happy to find the oldest home in town( 1954). Sadly, the house was redone in ' 08 and mostly everything was torn out. They left only the original tub, and Youngstown sink( but THANK GOD they did!). So, we rescued( aka bought) a 50s pink toilet and sink that someone was ripping out and brought them to our house. So, since we were too late to save this house, we saved their pink bathroom instead! We are bringing the house back to the former glory that it once was, and it loves us for it! <p> Kay on November 22nd, 2010 5:05 pm <p> Deep breath. I, now and forevermore, pledge to never again consider gutting my pink and black upstairs hall bath. She has survived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pledge to learn to clean her surfaces better and give her a new spiffy, shiny life.

I will send them to this site! <p> Amy Sibul on November 30th, 2010 5:53 pm <p> Upon seeing my new house 's pink bathroom, my first instinct was to gut. My husband urged me not to. This website helped me see the light. Now, with some pizzazz, some polished chrome, some frilly black accents, even a few rhinestones, I have fallen in love with Mamie Pink! I love my pink bathroom and vow to stay true to Mamie 's vision. <p> Alice on December 1st, 2010 1:28 pm <p> I grew up with a pink and maroon bathroom.

The tile looks just like the background on this page, black border too. Unfortunately, the tub enclosure has been retiled in what can only be described as a pixelated beach scene. It 's like showering in Super Mario World. We 'll be looking for replacement tile to match the original! <p> Becci on December 4th, 2010 12:36 am <p> I grew up in a house in New Jersey with a pink bathroom( exactly the same as the background of the site, black edging and all) and I had NO IDEA that people were trying to save them or that I 'd had something unusual. It was a great bathroom but we moved out of the house when I was a teenager in ' 96 and I have no idea what the new owners have done to it. Hopefully they 've had the sense to keep it intact. The house was built in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicole Z. on December 5th, 2010 2:12 pm <p> My boyfriend and I recently bought a house, the couple who built it had the best of everything.

The biggest bathroom ever is PINK, and I mean everything... pink tiled walls, floor, standing shower, bathtub, pink toilet, pink sink.... I decided to paint the vanity black... My only problem is shower curtain... what do to with a shower curtain to match pink black and white. I do nt want my honey to lose all sense of mascullinity in the bathroom but its very hard to find something not pink powder puff or poodle for the shower curtain to match! Any tipe are highly welcome!

I can not afford the amount of work it would take, and it is priceless. OMG LOOK at this pink bathroom!!!!!! <p> I had a pink and black( mostly black) bathroom which was described by my mother as " Italian " when we moved to Long Island from Massachusetts in 1961. In retrospect it was unique and I hope it is still in the beach house in Bayville, NY where we lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time, but I have long been a fan of pink and plan to do my bathroom renovation right here in Oakland in mostly pink. Many old homes here built in the 20s have colorful tile bathrooms -- alas, not the foreclosure we bought -- it was renovated to dull whites/grays somewhere along the way. Let 's hear it for pink!!! <p> Lynne E on December 29th, 2010 10:55 pm <p> I celebrate my vintage pink and black bathroom with tile matching the background of this page and wonderful black and pink basketweave pattern tile floor. My house was built in 1927 and and the tiles are solid as a rock. Since we moved into the house in 1989, I have taken down a busy black print wallpaper and painted the top walls and ceiling a pale pink, so I actually made the bathroom PINKER! <p> Claudie Frid on December 29th, 2010 10:57 pm <p> My whole cottage is PINK. A little blue pastel thrown in and mint green, but PINK is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I LOVE PINK. There is no room for beige in this world, or brown for that matter. <p> Merritt on December 30th, 2010 12:43 am <p> For the past 42 years, I have not been fortunate enough to live in a house or apartment with a pink tiled bathroom ; however, the house I lived in up until age 6 had a bathroom very reminiscent of the " Mamie Pink " bathrooms shown on this site. I think I must have realized even then that pink was the perfect color for a bathroom and always wanted a pink bathroom. <p> I was renting an apartment in the late 1990s and when its bathroom needed to be repainted due some water damage, my landlord agreed to pay for the paint and my darling boyfriend( now husband) painted it a bubble-gum pink! <p> Later, I bought a small condo and the same boyfriend painted one bathroom a burnt-sugar pink and the other bathroom an orange sherbet color( okay, not pink but close and it really suited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger condo and both bathrooms are painted pink -- albeit more subtle shades -- clamshell and malibu pink( a sort of mauve). <p> I 'll never forget when my asinine cousin from out of town visited me while I was living in the apartment with the bubble-gum pink bathroom : She did not realize it was I who chose the color and made some rude comment about it.( Of course her bathrooms are gray and some god-awful Ralph Lauren 1980s green. Go figure!) <p> Once when traveling, I had the tremendous good fortune of staying in a bed-and-breakfast that had a lavender-tiled, lavender-fixture bathroom preserved from the 1920s. It 's a memory I shall treasure forever. <p> Michelle on December 30th, 2010 2:45 pm <p> I feel sick every time I see old tile destroyed on home renovation shows. I do n't have a pink bathroom but it would definitely be a selling point for me if I was in the market to buy. <p> Pam Reardon on December 30th, 2010 5:10 pm <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1956 that had recently been redecorated and I grew up with the pink ceramic tub, sink, toilet in a room with BLACK plastic tiles on the walls and black with pink swirls tile on the floor. Fortunately it was the sunniest room in the mornings. It stayed a pink and black retreat until the wall tiles cement gave up the ghost. It is a more pastel muted pink bathroom with the original fixtures, but no more black walls and floor. The downstairs half-bathroom is still the same vintage but it is all in medium green -- another colour from that mid-Fifties renovation. And now it 's my house and the pink shall remain( unless the floor collapses and the upstairs bathroom winds up in the downstairs hall closet!) Pick Pink. <p> Melissa on December 30th, 2010 10:15 pm <p> This site is so darn cute! I have a pastel pink and blue bathroom in the home I rent.

We spent all our money redoing the kitchen so it 's a good thing we love our bathroom! It 's the only reason we could afford our house -- I think it was a dealbreaker for most other buyers. Our relatives shudder when they walk in and ask us when we 're going to redo the bathroom but we just laugh.

Right now, I am working little by little to create my own in my 1960 home.( the original was gone when we moved in) I have pink sink, Universal Rundle toilet,( like the pic of the one on your site) and tile floor done, but am working on a back-splash, and counter top, finish paint and possibly wallpaper. Do n't know about that though, we have no fans in our bathrooms,( I know about wallpaper and moisture) and until I figure out one to put through a block wall, it may be a wish to amend! Ca n't put it in the ceiling... we have a radiant heat unit with wiring in the ceiling and might damage it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some progress made. Or before and afters... maybe you could help with some ideas, I am using materials from donation restores, so I am really saving a lot and doing a lot of the work on my own,... so it is a " One of a Kind! " My own piece of art. My guest bathroom is an American Standard peachy color, still working on that one too, with some salvage materials and doing a little at a time!! Oh, BTW, thanks for helping me with the color of my GE stove again! Jacquie <p> Laurel on January 1st, 2011 2:20 pm <p> Thank you for your site -- found it via the NYTimes article.... not that I do not love pink, but I think you are really taking a stand here on ALL mid-century pastel bathrooms and tile work -- starting in the late 20s and continuing through the 60s before 70s " neutrals " took hold.( It will take quite a while to get a " keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Alas, my 20s home has very plain white subway tiles in a mostly period bathroom. But I grew up in a 50s house, and have many wonderful memories of my Nana 's tiny 1954 bungalow with just your pink bathroom tiled in black!( Nana decorated it with a BLACK shower curtain with pink poodles and many other poodle accessories! wish I had them still....) My mom had a yellow bathroom with black trim ; my best friend 's home had gray tile trimmed in maroon( very attractive combo). My first apartment had yellow and peach tile ; the second had a wild setup with peach walls trimmed in green and GREEN fixtures!( I was insanely jealous of our neighbors who had the identical bath but with green walls and PEACH fixtures.) <p> One thing you might wish to note for readers : most average homeowners were lucky to get " fashionable " pastel tile WALLS and perhaps floor in their baths. Most of what I describe above were wall tiles -- the bathtub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are always cheaper, due to the coloring process adding another step( or two for black or dark colors) to the ceramic process. <p> If you are LUCKY LUCKY LUCKY enough to have colored FIXTURES, treasure them -- because they were quite expensive in their day. A pink bath with pink fixtures was a real step up from a pink bath with white fixtures! Later on, in the late 50s and 60s, colored appliances became more common, but still cost more than plain white. <p> It is easier to find colored toilets than sinks, and sinks than tubs. Most tubs must be broken up to be removed, so it hard to find a used tub that is even intact -- plus, the scrubbing tubs endure ruins the porcelainized coating.( Tubs are not ceramic like toilets and most sinks -- old tubs are mostly a baked porcelain finish over cast iron, or sometimes in more modern tubs, over steel.) Tubs also suffer more " color fading " than toilets or sinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, brown or red are the most costly to produce and rarest to find. I 've seen amazing period bathrooms( circa 40s) with dark peach walls, black trim and ALL BLACK fixtures -- gorgeous! though I 'm not sure a bath in a black tub would make me feel all that clean, LOL. <p> I love original tilework in baths( and some very lucky kitchens!) and I 'd NEVER rip it out, but always try to work with it and preserve it -- it 's far more clever to work with what you HAVE than to just destroy things and put in " modern " styles that will soon go OUT OF STYLE.... trust me in 10 years( or less) you will hear the ripping sound of granite, stainless and " all white " being ripped out of countless homes and " the next trendy thing " being put in. <p> Instead let 's treasure and preserve our wonderful legacy of beautiful, high quality pastel tilework! I have passed a link to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buddies! THANK YOU. <p> 50s Pam on January 1st, 2011 2:58 pm <p> Hi, Laurel, YES indeed, it 's a stand in defense of all vintage colors / aesthetic. Pink=emblematic. I explained this to the NYT reporter, but obviously, they can not use everything in an article. Thank you so much for your comment -- and welcome to our retro wonderland. <p> So nice to have company in this cause! I sent the link the home page to a home magazine last spring that showed the remodel( destruction!) of a pink bathroom. I do n't think they printed my letter, but at least the editors know not everyone thought the remodel was an improvement. <p> 50s Pam on January 2nd, 2011 3:28 pm <p> good for you, cynthia!!! <p> KM on January 2nd, 2011 7:47 pm <p> One of the big selling points when I bought my house was the amazing yellow and black tile kitchen ; a full wainscot almost 4 feet high with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripping it all out, How could I not save that 30? s tile, I ask you? Cheers to all who are treasuring this great stuff! <p> Amelia on January 4th, 2011 12:43 am <p> I just moved into a house with a pink tile on the walls in the bathroom. I liked it right away because it made me think of my grandmother. I think the color is soothing. <p> Benja Parke on January 4th, 2011 3:12 pm <p> I recently purchased a late 50? s mid-century ranch with the most fabulous pink bathroom. The previous owners have tried to stifle it 's retro-wonder, but i plan to do all i can to get it back to it 's atomic glory. I 'm looking forward to the great inspiration and guidance I 'm sure I 'll find here. <p> -Benja Nashville, TN <p> Francine Craven on January 5th, 2011 12:30 pm <p> I am a fan of the British series " As Time Goes By " and in that series ' interior, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saturated( hot) pink. The wall also features a large framed print, whose scale and colors complement the wall color. The effect is lovely, cheerful and warm. Some years ago, my father was hospitalized after a fall, and the walls of his room were covered with a rose-colored linen-textured paper. One wall was done in rose and an adjacent wall was done in a sand or beige-like tone. The rose effect was wonderful, and the blend of rose and sand made things even more interesting. These two " experiences " made me wonder why pink has n't been more popular as an interior color. Is it considered too " girly "? Maybe that 's finally going to change. <p> MangoMel on January 5th, 2011 12:57 pm <p> My house has two wonderful 1950? s bathrooms, one pink and white and one seafoam green and white. Anyone who would rip out such perfection is insane. <p> I have The most beautiful Pink bathroom, It looks a though it was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors, its overwhelmingly beautyful and the facts that you posted makes all the sence in the world. Even before this pledge, I swore that bathroom will never be touched! <p> Anita Burg on January 5th, 2011 10:49 pm <p> We just moved into a 1955 rambler with an entirely pink bathroom. Floors, tub, wall tiles, sink, toilet.... all original and in perfect condition. <p> I did n't know what to think of it at first, but every time I walk in there I feel happy! It 's my favorite room in the house. Even my huge, burly husband loves the pink bathroom. He says it is comforting. <p> Kathy Byland Gardner on January 6th, 2011 8:16 am <p> Pam, From my vantage point in Michigan, I sometimes laugh at the trend stories The New York Times comes up with years after the rest of us have already caught on.( Their recent discovery of thrift stores comes to mind.) So when I saw the headline, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has discovered pink bathrooms! " Since we have two of them in our 1951 ranch, and the local stores do not carry replacements tiles, I 'm thrilled to find your site! <p> Pam, this is New York Times Janice and you know how I love, love, love pink bathrooms! I came over to STPB to see if I could find some design inspiration as we begin our pink bathroom installation and realized I never took the Save the Pink Bathroom pledge. I not only pledge to love, honor and save pink bathrooms, I pledge to bring another one into the world! BTW, I 'm looking for a good paint color to go with pink tile with black trim( just like this site design). Would love to do wallpaper, but hubbie says no( he HATES wallpaper) and given that he 's not argued against installing a pink bathroom, I 'm not pushing it by standing firm on the wallpaper issue. Any ideas? <p> angela davey on January 9th, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has the pink &; whitefloor tile along w/ the pink wall tile done on the lower half. I decided to paint the walls a white that has a slight hue of pearl to it &; then did all the wood work &; trim in a deep raisin color. This seems to tone down &; show off at the same time. I 'll try to post a pic. when I get it finished. Love the room!!! <p> I am taking the pledge!!!! I live in a historic 1927 home in Macon, GA. My upstairs jack and jill bathroom has all original bathroom fixtures and has the original pink tile walls. My husband desperately wants to change the pink tile. I refuse! The bathroom floor is the original basket weave tile that has pink black, grey and white. Whenever I have house guest stay with me they always compliment the pink tile and floor. My son and daughter share this bathroom. While my 6 year old grumbles that he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old sister. She LOVES it! So happy I found your blog! I will email pics soon! Smiles, Jenn <p> I ca n't wait to own my own home, so that I can install a pink bathroom! I have always wanted a little " corner tub " like one of my friends had in her parent 's house when I was a kid. <p> Barb on January 16th, 2011 2:09 pm <p> I too have a wonderful pink bathroom. I recently purchased a 1953 two story home with an apartment in the upper level. I live there and my parents live below( they are elderly and this allows them to be independent). It has the classic pink bathroom, pink tiles, maroon border and mosaic pink tile floor. All in excellent condition. I do not have the pink sink or tub, but all original. It is, of course small, just 6 x 8, but full of charm. My first thought was to gut this bathroom and start over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've found this sight I have decided to save the pink bathroom and embrace all the pink has to offer. <p> shana pack-gangluff on January 20th, 2011 6:25 pm <p> I LOVE my pink bathroom and have no plans to change it. I have a 1958 retro " Brady Brunch " style home. The master bath is peach and guest bath pink. The tile is immaculate and in perfect condition in both baths. The sinks and toilets match. All of my best girlfriends little daughters love to come " pee pee on the pink potty! " Thank you for " saving the pink! " <p> My husband and I have lived in our 1950s-era cottage for three years. Although our house is n't completely original, we fell in love with its charming hardwood floors, big windows, telephone nook and its yellow and teal-tiled bathroom. It 's the sweetest little home, and it has brought us so much joy. Although some of our neighbors ' homes are original, sadly many have fallen victim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do away with anything that 's " old, " but unfortunately they are missing the beauty and charm of a by-gone era when things were made to last and to make us smile. You ca n't be sad in a yellow bathroom, and you REALLY ca n't be sad in a pink one. That 's especially important because our yellow bathroom is also our only bathroom, and we 're fighting for sink space nearly every day! <p> Mandy Stachyra on January 22nd, 2011 11:15 am <p> i used to hate the color pink. but, i have fallen in love with my pink bathroom. the color makes me feel so good in the morning when i 'm tired and getting ready for my day. i pledge to save and take good care of my pink bathroom!! mandy stachyra, illinois <p> Oh yes I too have the honor of now owning a home that was built in 1957! Our master bath has pink everything, floor, walls, trim, doors, comode, tub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pink we can not change and paint the rest. Today I have been painting trim, doors and cabinets white and the walls we are painting brown. Ca n't wait to have it finished! I told my husband just last week if we waited around long enough pink would probably come back in style. Looks like I may have been right. So glad I found this website. <p> vicki barth on January 26th, 2011 11:05 am <p> The pink bathroom was the deal maker when I bought my 1955 rambler! I love it! <p> Except for a replacement toilet, my 1957 rambler has all the original pink fixtures, floor, and wall tile in the bathroom. They really " do n't make ' em like they used to " -- the stuff is almost indestructible, and is still holding up after over a half century! <p> Eliza on January 26th, 2011 1:05 pm <p> It makes me ill when I see them tearing out pink bathrooms on those home renovation shows! I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm trying to sell and the tile stores all say " no one sells that shade of yellow any more ". Not sure what we are going to do but I ca n't take out our yellow tile, it is so 1970s! <p> Eliza on January 26th, 2011 1:07 pm <p> oh yeah -- The Johnson County, KS museum has a fabulous bathroom in their 1950s All Electric House http : **32;10691;TOOLONG. The house was rescued from demolition and donated to the museum. <p> patty on January 26th, 2011 2:55 pm <p> LOVE love my pink bathroom in my 1951 duplex. I used chocolate paint to nicely offset the pink / peach color and a fun shower curtain finishes it off perfectly! <p> claire on January 26th, 2011 3:00 pm <p> I have the peach and black bathroom, but totally undestand the need to keep it. Always hard to find shower curtains that match. My bathroom is so old I do n't have a plug in in the bathroom. <p> 50s Pam on January 26th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on ebay -- and my blog -- I pretty much showcase all new-old-stock shower curtains that come up on ebay as they are great finds. Oh, also check etsy.com -- vintage. Finally, you can go to Calico Corners -- see what fabric they have and whether they can custom make one for you. <p> Puzzy on January 26th, 2011 8:12 pm <p> I pledge to save all 4 of my totally intact 1955 constructed bathrooms! I have grey, mint green, peach and copper! I am a Realtor so I see lots of houses and I have only seen 3 bathrooms with the copper tile and two of these wonderful bathrooms were in my homes! Walking into my current home and seeing the same copper that was in my first home sealed the deal! I try and point out the quality of these original bathrooms( kitchens, floors, fixtures and so on) to my clients and I beg them to call me if they decide they must " update " their new home so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who can appreciate them! Pam, it was a blessing finding your sites. Thank you again! <p> Jane on January 26th, 2011 11:42 pm <p> Oh, I miss my pink 50? s bathroom in my previous home of 18 years. Most people including my husband thought I should change it. The realtors, the appraisors and local interior designers all urged me to update the pink bathroom with its cast iron tub, toilet, sink and tile. I stubbornedly refused ; knowing that the pink had more character than their own boring, beige bathrooms. I hope the new owners will retain it. <p> The previous owner and the builder of the 1951 modern style home applied many of Frank Lloyd Wright 's design principles and added his own innovations. He placed heated copper coils under the pink bath tub to augment the heat retention of the cast iron tub. He also added a clothes chute inside the vanity. I did refresh the bathroom by adding wallpaper that had a bit of turquoise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3/4 pages to pink bathrooms. Then I learned that the Dallas paper recently featured the same article. Hope the HGTV people read the articles. <p> My grandparents had an all pink bath in their early 1940? s home. We especially loved the Kohler pink corner tub. Hope it is still in the home. <p> My husband and I just became the proud of residents of a 1950s duplex with a pink tiled bathroom with white fixtures. Some of the tiles are in sad, sad shape but I pledge to bring our pink bathroom back to life. <p> I lived with one pink bathroom for 30 years and was always asked when was I going to change it. I moved to another home in August 2010 and it has a pink bathroom. I ca n't wait to return it to it 's original splendor. As a kitchen and bath designer I am now helping others with pink bathrooms renew them and save them. Long live the pink bathroom! <p> 50s Pam on January 28th, 2011 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the minneapolis star-tribune story -- i need to get all these news stories up on this blog! <p> Theresa on January 28th, 2011 10:17 pm <p> Long live any ceramic tile bathroom from the middle of the last century. I am blessed with a full salmon tile bathroom and a lovely yellow tile half bath in my 1946 home. Thanks for keeping up the love of these old( but classic and well loved) bathrooms. Love your website! <p> La Vera Wharam on January 29th, 2011 10:15 am <p> When we move in to our 50? s home I was one of the only fan of the ' PINK. " I 'm sooo glad we still have it. The sink, toilet and tub and tile are in excellent condition. Living in Minnesota you just have to know everything is cool in PINK! I pledge to love and care for the Pink! <p> I too pledge to love, defend, and save pink bathrooms, and other beautifully-coloured bathrooms from the twentieth century! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original from 1951. It has gotten to the point my stomach turns when I see a travertine-tiled bathroom. I love the pink ones, too... There is a certain charm to them. Besides... pink is so flattering to most of us. <p> My earliest memory of a pink bathroom was my Grandma Etta 's bathroom. She had pink sink, pink toilet, pink tub. All her accents were black and white. She had a little soapdish that had a skunk and the saying, I 'm a little stinker. I have a new home and everything is beige and white, so I have pink rugs in my bathroom, also pink shower curtain with white polka dots. I have a skunk on the wall which holds matches and has a strikeplate. He is my little stinker. I have movie stars of the 1940 and 1950? s in frames on the walls. The kids call it my hollywood bath. Our next house will be an older home with a pink bathroom. Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathrooms!!! love, Deb <p> April on February 2nd, 2011 12:05 am <p> We are about to move into a 1950s rental with a pink bathroom in the hallway and a blue toileted one in the master. I admit it : I hate pink. <p> However, my best friend is a wealth of information and when I mentioned trying to hide( not redo) the pink-ness, she turned me onto this website. BEST thing ever! <p> Now, I ca n't wait to get into the house and " pop the pink " with retro accents and fun, quirky 50? s touches. Thanks for standing up for such an understated and unknown treasure! <p> Pictures to come soon, hopefully! I also plan to put the pink pledge up on the wall in the bathroom for all to read =) <p> Jane Felton on February 3rd, 2011 11:16 am <p> I pledge to keep my sweet pink bathroom! I love it Shower curtains are difficult to find as I have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilet and tub, mine needs to be resurfaced because of chipping. What I need the most is a new pink soap holder for the wall in the bathtub/shower are. By kid broke the handle. Any suggestions? Love this sight gottago <p> Wish I had a pink bathroom... sigh. Not just any pink bathroom, a BRIGHT FUCHSIA bathroom! Yes. My home is the most awful boring white you could imagine. I would rennovate it but it 's a rental and we 're probably moving soon anyway. As soon as I own my own home, you can bet I will have an awful, colorful home! <p> I 'm doing my best to spread the word. I so wish I had a pink bathroom. I almost bought a house with a beautiful one but in the end it was not the right house for me and I ended up with a still old house( 1931) but the vintage tile had been taken out long ago. I so wish that I had a pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to change their bathrooms. They are so lucky to have them. <p> Heidi Koopman on February 4th, 2011 11:59 am <p> When the ceiling in the bathroom of our 1955 rambler FELL IN, we had the chance to gut and re-do the pink &; black bathroom. Instead we painstakingly filed the grout off of every pink tile, and rebuilt it! <p> We have pink tiles all over our 60? s bungalow bathroom.Also Dame Barbara Cartland should also be a role model, after all even her books are now published as the Pink Collection. Yesterdays rubbish is tommorrows rare features! <p> Miss Bunneh on February 4th, 2011 3:01 pm <p> I hope I can not only save the pink bathroom but keep the house itself which is now in foreclosure! Pray for me and if I get to keep the house, I promise to do something to make the bathroom even more pink! Thanks all! <p> Miss Bunneh on February 4th, 2011 3:03 pm <p> P.S.

Thank goodness the landlord 's wife loved the tile and refused to gut the rooms for a more " modern " look. The kitchen looks great since the floor is black-and-white linoleum and the cabinets are white ; not too punk, not too kitschy. <p> Suzanne on February 5th, 2011 9:29 am <p> I swore when I bought my house 14 years ago that the first thing I was going to do was gut my pink bathroom. But back then, I did n't have $20,000 to spare, and over time, I started to bond with my oh-so-ugly " oval office! " So I named her Flo and decked her out in falmingos, and the rest is history! <p> Thompson on February 6th, 2011 4:47 am <p> Pink bathrooms with a lovely pink tub are a must. I hope I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Zelda Crunchmeyer on February 8th, 2011 6:04 pm <p> These wonderful bathrooms with their durable tile actually date back to the ' 40s. All houses in my neighborhood were built in the ' 40s and most have or had this kind of bath. And most are pink. When I " remodeled " mine in 2002 I was bent on preservation. The stool and sink, which were always white, were replaced with period-appropriate pedestal sink and matching stool, both compatible with the original mint condition wave-bottom tub. Original tile walls and floor remain. When I bought the house, someone applied taupe paint to the aqua ovals in the narrow decorative row of tile one row down from the top. How tasteless! I discovered that right away, and spent a rainy April night with the ZipStrip to uncover the pretty original color. It 's a splendid bathroom -- just right for one person.

Had it not been original, I would have scrapped it... but it 's lasted over 50 years of home ownerships... I got ta respect that. Plus, there is something nostalgic about the whole house which is what we fell in love with -- the pink bathroom just adds to that.

I would like a pink rose tile insert. Please advise asap. <p> Regina E. Brisgone on February 26th, 2011 6:33 pm <p> We bought a 1951 ranch that 's got so many little gadgets and things that I feel like I 'm in the Jetsons. The bathrooms all have large fixtures in 50s colors( one in green ; another with tan and blue( the blue fixtures are being replaced), and the " PINK Bathroom -- the highlight of the bunch. All of the bathrooms have sinks with ceramic spouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom has deep pink tiles on the walls with a ribbon-like border( 1/4 inch wide) of pink tulips with pale gray and pink contrasts. It 's got a ceiling fan that looks like a jet engine( it is stainless steel has a light in it and blows heat out of it, too). Fixtures are gray. Floor tiles are small white squares, which I think are an update. They are not bad. I was sort of embarrassed about it until a friend saw it and raved, " You 've got a pink bathroom! I love pink bathrooms. I always have had a pink bathroom wherever I 've lived. " She said that she had had to make the bathroom pink while mine was " ready made. " I 've never felt the need to hide it again. I am thrilled you put up this website. I spotted your website in the Virginian Pilot newspaper 's home section that had an article about " the pink. " Got a Benjamin Moore paint consultant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help me pick out just the right " light pink " for the plaster walls. Gina <p> I pledge to have a pink bathroom one day.A lovely 1940? s style pink bathroom.Hubby may not like being surrounded by girlie pink but i will. <p> Monica on February 28th, 2011 2:25 am <p> I bought a mid 50? s fibro house in Australia last year. It has a pink 50? s bathroom with pink tiles and a pink bath and pink ceramic soap holders and pink ceramic towel rails! A previous owner replaced the pink pedastel basin with a hideous white laminate vanity. I pledge to try my hardest to convince my hubby to let me restore my pink bathroom to it 's former glory, he wants to rip it all out and put in a modern bathroom, I 'm in love with my pink bathroom and i would hate to see it go! <p> Leslie on February 28th, 2011 1:39 pm <p> My husband and I recently moved into his grandparents old farm house, which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom. We originally planned on hiring someone to repaint all of the tile, but I 've decided to leave it and try to paint and decorate around it. Mind you, it 's on the countertops, 3 or 4 feet up the walls, on the entire floor, the towel rack, toilet paper rack, soap dishes, toothbrush holders, and tub.... so I 'll do my best to make it cute!! <p> Vanessa Hardy on March 5th, 2011 3:06 pm <p> We have almost completed our 1955 pink and grey bathroom restoration. I need some help, though! Does anyone in the Nashville area know a good company for restoring our Cast-iron tub? It is built-in, so we would need a vendor that can restore it in-house. The finish is pocked and the tub is rusting. Otherwise, it is a perfect 1955 tub and we want to keep it and all the lovely pink tile! <p> Suton C on March 16th, 2011 11:08 pm <p> When we bought our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear to my spouse was the fact that we will NOT disturb or destroy either of our 50? s tiled baths( one pink and one green).

I suspect my 1957 L-shaped ranch did, too, before a 80? s remodel by the previous owner, since several houses near me still have them. I plan to someday restore my kitchen to it 's mid-century glory and eventually the bathroom, too. It just may become pink again! My grandmother 's house still has a pink bathroom. <p> Mindy on March 19th, 2011 2:36 am <p> I was looking into retro fabrics for draperies and I happened upon Save the Pink Bathrooms. I too have a 1963 pink tile bathroom and absolutely love it! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm tree profiles since we live by the beach. Too bad my kitchen was n't saved like the bathroom- it probably used to be the same tile in turquoise! I love those too! Pink bathrooms forever! <p> Tammy on March 29th, 2011 8:42 pm <p> We love our pink bathroom that is original to our 1959 multi level split ranch home. The house was untouched by the only previous/original owner. They kept it all in pretty good condition. Double pink sinks, pink cabinets, pink tile. Pink, pink, pink! Would n't change it for the world! <p> I pledge to preserve my pink and maroon bathroom built in 1957. Just hope I can find the tile to rebuild the shower as it has a leak and tear out is sad to think about. <p> Erica on April 11th, 2011 2:21 pm <p> Wow is all I can say. What a bunch of lovely pink loos! I have always loved PINK. It is a true shame that so many designers encourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking bathrooms. <p> I am so lucky. I recently purchased a 1962 ranch. The unfortunate part, the previous owners did no updating. The good part, the previous owners did no updating!!! There are, count ' em, two pink privies.

I doubt I 'll get the 1960s home of my dreams, but I vow to give my modern home retro flavor. <p> I am in the process of purchasing a 1956 home that had one owner. It is all original. It overwhelmed me, but I 'd like to keep things authentic. If you have any advice on how to update things while keeping the spirit of the house? I am going to love sharing photos of this house. It has a pink and teal bathroom, original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone I show the house to tells me how to modernize it, but I want to live there first and see slowing if I want to change anything. Great site! <p> I pledge to keep the tile in my 1940s vintage pink and blue bathroom. I realize that it is part of a design era that needs to be celebrated not disdained. I ca n't wait to write my blog post featuring my pink bathroom. Thank you for all you do for all vintage lovers out there! <p> Erik on April 26th, 2011 7:50 pm <p> I 'm not going to lie. When we gout our 1940s house, the first thing we wanted to redo were the peach and pink bathroom. Good thing our priorities changedand now we love them... I pledge to save the Pink( and the peach) bathroom and only renovate with orignial time and fittings!! <p> Big Pomp Brian on April 28th, 2011 10:47 am <p> The original tile in the bathrooms of my 1950 house, along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have green and black in what I refer to as the Men 's room and yellow with maroon trim in the Girls room. It makes me ill when I watch the renovation shows and they rip all the character out of a mid century home. Keep fighting the good fight! <p> Beth on April 29th, 2011 2:48 pm <p> I purchased my grandparents ' house after my grandpa passed away last year. My grandparents purchased the house new in 1961. Not only does this midwestern ranch have a pink bathroom, but also a powder blue one and the original range. I have many good childhood memories in this house, but must get a new oven as 1961 technology requires rotating items multiple times for even baking. However, the pink bathroom reminds me so much of my grandma I would have trouble changing it. <p> Robin Hogue on May 1st, 2011 7:42 pm <p> I am a Mid Century junkie! I would love to have a pink bathroom with all the original tile. I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and artwork. I 'm very lucky to have some family vintage pieces. I not only love the style, but it takes me back to my childhood and I had a great one. <p> Janine on May 4th, 2011 3:36 pm <p> I have a pink bathroom that I inherited when my husband and I purchased our 1950? s rancher in suburban NJ. I do love my pink bathroom and will do all I can to preserve it.( even though our tub is white, it 's nothing a shower curtain ca n't cover) <p> I inherited the house that my dad designed and had built for my mom after they retired. He let her design the bathroom with pink tile and floor ; very retro. Really beautiful! Currently my son is using this bathroom so I 've toned the pink thing down a bit by incorporating gray towels and such. He 's leaving for college in August and the pink towels and accents are coming back! Oh yea, the house is n't even that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property we 've been renting are planning to demolish the house and along with it, an original 1954 pink bathroom including a lovely pink corner bathtub in excellent condition. They have given us permission to take anything we want from the house, I 'm going to make sure that the bathtub is taken out and either brought with us or that it finds a new home with someone who will appreciate it. <p> T.J. Blazek on May 16th, 2011 10:22 pm <p> My partner and I have a house built in 1941 in central New Jersey( with the main original dark tan/copper ceramic tiled bathroom with ivory fixtures still intact). A second bathroom in sunshine yellow tiles and white fixtures was added in the 1950? s( I 'd love for the fixtures to be ming green -- that 'd be SHARP!). All we 'd need to have the house complete would be to have a third bathroom in pink. It is my pledge to maintain the historic integrity of these bathrooms and to not make unnecessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink bathroom -- but a blue/ green/orange one! Same style tiles, so I thought its close enough that I could take the pledge!! I heard a great tip that I wanted to pass along... if you are having trouble deciding what color to paint the walls( like in my case where there are 3 different color tiles..) go get an old man 's tie that has all the colors in it -and you can pull a color out of there. Most of those old ties you find at Goodwill have some crazy color combinations -- you just might find your bathroom tiles!!! <p> trisha on May 19th, 2011 1:57 pm <p> We were so happy to be able to buy our home that the pink bathroom did n't bother me one little bit. Our bathroom growing up was pink -- still is Momma never has changed it. At least ours has a shower. Looking back : since we never had a shower Daddy and brother got to take sit down baths in our Pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will always be pink. I could n't love it more if I tried. <p> kelly on May 22nd, 2011 3:46 am <p> Excited to find this web site, but VERY disappointed there is no picture gallery, and if there is and I 'm too lame to find it please point me in the right direction! -- thank you =) <p> We purchased our 1953 ranch house in 1997 w/two baths -- one blue w/a lovely shower, the other pink w/a great big pink tub, and classic sink -- but the toilet had been updated. The first thing we did was to replace the toilet w/a Standard vintage pink toilet. <p> The realtors had painted the bathrooms in grey.... how clueless! <p> symea on May 26th, 2011 4:57 pm <p> YAY!!!!! just bought a 1964 Ranch with a mint condition original pink bathroom( tub, tile and sink) it basically made my decision for me. Cant wait to get in there and make it MY own personal pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glass of bubbly! <p> I 'm not a realtor, but I get invited to tour LOTS of midcentury homes for appreciation, consultation and next steps. I pledge to make every single homeowner aware of savethepinkbathrooms.com as an option. I hate pink but I love pink bathrooms!!!! <p> At risk of being accused of being afflicted with " Low T ", I swear that if I ever buy a fabulous vintage house with a pink bathroom, I will seek to honor, protect and defend the royal pinkness and buy a retro set of ceramic fish and ceramic gold bubbles as were in the bathoom of my childhood. I pinkie promise swear, so help me Haver. <p> Dawn Bininger on June 1st, 2011 7:29 pm <p> I recently bought my first home. A1959 Ranch. My house is PINK stucco... And my bathroom is pink as well. I fell in love with my house immediately. It had not been changed in 52 years! I am working on updating it slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to me to maintain the integrity of the house. I have a pink sink, tub, and toilet. I have white and black tile with pink accents. And I had a pink wall. Sure. I could have gutted it. But it was in GREAT shape. The tile is BEAUTIFUL. So instead, I decorated around it. I went with a Pin Up girl theme. Kept everything as is with the exception of a new light fixture and painted the wood cabinets white. It looks great. I may eventually change the pink counter top, but I am in no hurry. I LOVE LOVE LOVE my " Girlie " bathroom... <p> Please add my name to the pink pledge in order to save and preserve the wonderful tradition of pink bathrooms. Thank you, Megan Shaw <p> Mike P on June 19th, 2011 2:22 pm <p> I close on my first house next week!!! YEP YEP!! The pink bathroom was such a deal breaker!!! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting it. I found this website and now the pink bathroom stays!! You Saved A PINK BATHROOM.

I am sending pics soon! <p> Gloria kruppstadt on June 23rd, 2011 3:14 pm <p> I have had the original pink bathroom-tub, toilet and sink-with grey tiles on walls and floors. I will preserve it as my main guest bathroom. Thanks to all for making this a cool thing to do before it was too late! <p> Angie on June 27th, 2011 1:39 pm <p> I manage a vintage motel which still has several pink bathrooms with black trim, along with the old black and white mosaic tile floors. We are upgrading the facilities but I will NOT allow any changes to the pink tile. Unfortunately, the original plumbing fixtures are long gone. <p> Waiting for my personal bath are a full set of pinky-coral vintage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and a 1960? s acrylic of pink flowers, in storage until I can do my own pink, coral, and black bathroom. <p> Decorator colors should be serene or cheerful, but never depressing. The tan epidemic apparently is a result of a PR campaign by antidepressant drug manufacturers and psychologists. Viva the pink bathroom! <p> Several years ago I lived in a small apt in a 1957 12-unit building. The bathroom walls were pink with black trim, but the tub and sink were white -- white paint on top of pink! With my landlord 's approval I stripped the paint off and exposed the glory. Do n't know what 's become of it since moving, but I do miss that bathroom. Think Pink! <p> Maggy on July 6th, 2011 12:17 am <p> I more want to save retro bathrooms as pink is my least favorite color... but I grew up with a pink bathroom that was left over form the early to mid 50? s. I can remember tap dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope it still stands in that childhood house. <p> Diane in Oklahoma on July 7th, 2011 10:53 pm <p> I love my pink bathroom but I have to replace my floor and I need a pink toilet stool ring to make it complete. <p> Hi Pam, I stumble upon your site yesterday. I am in the process of buying a 1960 built ranch with a finished basement. It took me a little while to decide to buy the place due to the " ugly " but now that my closing date is getting closer I am thinking of things to do with it. I was thinking of doing to kitchen retro due to the fact that i do nt have to money to renovate just yet! The kitchen is the old style with the stove top in the counter and the oven on the side. When I found Save the pink bathroom " i freaked!! My bathroom has not only a pink tub, toilet and tiles it has double pink sinks and shiny silver wallpaper with pink flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I simplely ca n't get rid of it! I am so happy I found your site!!! Thank you so much! <p> Sarah Hansen on July 9th, 2011 1:55 pm <p> I enjoy my pink formica bathroom countertop every day. I also have a love of seafoam, teal and yellow bathrooms. Thank you, thank you for leading this charge! <p> Gertie on July 13th, 2011 8:45 pm <p> I have a 3 bathroom home. All are early 1960? s tiles. The guest bathroom is gloriously pink. I vowed before I found this website to preserve it. I had decided to add my version of " french " by accenting with white and black, and thus keep everything( including the pink formica counter top). Unfortunately, last fall I did lose the 5 gallon flush pink toilet. In an emergent plumbing need I was only offered up a white replacement. I vow... I shant let it happen again. And, I vow to maintain my other vintage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike on July 21st, 2011 3:49 pm <p> We recently purchased a 1925 home which suprise, suprise has a pick bathroom which accoridng ot the toilet tank was installed in 1948, or at elast remodeled that year. I woudl actually call it a water closet. It 's tiny... and located under the main staircase. But it sure beats running all the way upstairs. The sink and toilet are white, but the tile on hte walsl is unmistakebly pink/salmon color with goldish colored dark brown accents. The closet ca n't be more than 4? square, but it 's funciton and serves it 's purpose. It also has some great period floor tile as well. Only problem, no ventilaton whatsoever. So I 'll be adding a constant exhaust fan that 's also exhausting the garage located below. <p> Ashlie on July 23rd, 2011 9:21 am <p> Unfortunately my house has a dull hospital green colour scheme... HOWEVER I am working on my husband to allow me to renovate ONE of our bathrooms into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me luck.. I 'm sure I can persuade him some how! <p> Red on July 28th, 2011 3:08 pm <p> I absolutly LOVE LOVE LOVE my PINK Bathroom!!!! Our house was built in 1912 and previous owners installed the pink bathroom. I 've completed it with pink towels, pink bath mat, pink toothbrush holder and a pink shower curtian with flamingos. The doors are even pink! <p> Jacki on August 2nd, 2011 5:48 pm <p> My 1898 Victorian home has a pink deco bathroom that must have been put in when the house got indoor plumbing in the late 30? s or 40? s. The downstairs half-bath has the same deco floor, but in green tile. I would n't change these rooms for anything, particularly the pink! Even my husband loves it, and he 's no ninny. The tilework is fantastic- and it has a separate shower- clearly very high-end for the time! <p> I LOVE pink and HATE to see vintage bathrooms of ANY color destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispose of my vintage pink toilet when it just would n't WORK anymore( daily plunging was not a long-term solution) BUT I will never get rid of my pink and white " spattered " lookng tile! <p> lauren on August 5th, 2011 2:33 pm <p> We have a 1950? s cape with a great pink bathroom. When i decided to add some cute wallpaper to the scheme I found pieces of the most awesome mint green vintage wallpaper that had gondolas rowing!! It was AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!! I wish it could have been saved... I know there are vintage wallpapers out there but no amount of googling can recreate the awesomeness that was hiding behind the crappy 90s wallpaper. We have a pretty awesome custom vanity too with this cool formica with little gold flakes in it! <p> For the record, we have 2 bathrooms, and people were astonished that the bathroom I chose to renovate was NOT the pink one, but the tacky beige fake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5:18 pm <p> I have a pink bathroom with a maroon accent tile! Ilike my bath so much that i painted my kitchen pink too! <p> Such a great service you provide! We restore " vintage " houses and your website is a great source of inspiration and information on 50s and 60s bathrooms! Keep digging into the past and finding those nuggets of retro gold( or pink as it were)! <p> If I ever own a house, I pledge to make my bathroom pink if it is n't and protect it with my life if it already is. <p> Wendy McLemore on August 11th, 2011 11:31 am <p> I do n't have a pink bathroom in my ' 64 home, but I wholeheartedly support the effort to save them.

I imagine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have long since been replaced with white. The previous owners had painted the tile and tub white and the walls tan, but had left the pink floor.

It was totally out of character for the house and everyone told me to rip it out, but I refused. I restored it with a new black and white tile floor, vintage light fixtures from Rejuvenation, and new black ceramic towel bars. I replaced a ratty old medicine cabinet with a perfect round mirror, but I am still searching for the perfect cabinet of some kind... <p> Pat Navadomskis on August 23rd, 2011 6:58 pm <p> i have a pink bathroom.

I loved that kitchen! <p> Why does everybody just automatically move into a house and rip everything out? Why do they buy that house to just go in and rip it all out? And why does everybody have to have travertine tile in their bathrooms and granite and stainless steel in their kitchens? It all looks the same! BORING. <p> Have some respect for the retro! It does n't mean you ca n't refresh it 's look with some new paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! My friend moved into an apartment that had a green tile bathroom and she embraced the retro but made it fresh and modern too with some white and black accessories -- it looked better than most " modern " bathrooms. <p> Love the retro -- preserve it please! <p> Mitch Disalle on September 3rd, 2011 5:02 pm <p> I recentlhy moved from a 4,400 s.f. Colonial to one of Philadelphia 's ubiquitous 3 b/room brick rowhouses built in the early 50? s, and to my delight and amusement it had an almost 100% original pink bathroom( The white tub is an obvious replacement). <p> Going with my whole new attitude of " less is more " after the break-up of my 15 year marriage, I decided to embrace this little ' brick box ' for what it was, and make it part of my new adventure into a new life. These homes were built with simplicity, but some sense of style( by 1950 standards) like my stamped plaster walls and the pink &; black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- and I 'm lucky that the 1st two owners preserved this little gem so carefully. <p> The only change I made was to strip off the foil silver &; ' old lady blue flowers ' wallpaper, and after pondering it for weeks decided to paint the plaster walls a " wheat toast brown " -- which really changed the entire ' feel of the room.( Guys -- if you 're out there and wondering how to man-up a pink bathroom, try going with a grey or brown or taupe color to tone down the girliness of the Mamie Pink)! It 's stunning -- and after adding a few black 50? s accents( Pam -- I sent pics of the two little famenco dancers on your other blog) -- the feel of this post-war bathroom is complete! <p> Long live the Pink Privy! <p> Laurie on September 3rd, 2011 8:03 pm <p> Our pink bathroom is petite and pretty.

My grandmother had a pink bathroom in her farmhouse... and I remember, as a child, thinking how pretty it was whenever we visited. I never dreamed I would end up buying a house with a pink tile bath. We are purchasing a 1961 house in Iowa that has the Vintage original PINK tile, and also a BLUE tile bath in it. I am tickled " pink "... such sentimental thoughts.... My neighbor just painted over all of her pink tile in her bath a year ago... I hated to hear that...( but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it removed without damaging the tile!!) I think it will be fun to get my hands on this bath and decorate it keeping it 's character and personality and era in mind while adding some up-to-date splashes of decor and fabrics. Found this site and cheered! <p> Jacoba Dolloff on September 12th, 2011 2:18 am <p> I have a pink and black bathroom! Original to my 1956 house, and it clinched the deal for me! The other, smaller, bathroom is yellow and gray tile. I love that too! <p> Julie Hulce on September 16th, 2011 2:27 pm <p> I have a 1957 Better Homes &; Garden Idea Home. It 's probably at least 75% original. Each one was individualized by the contractor that built them. Mine happens to have both pink and yellow bathrooms. Those were my " WoW " moments in first looking at the house. The person I bought from laughed and said they 'd have to tell their son( who wanted the bathrooms renovated when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted above love to have a " Save the pink bathrooms " t shirt. <p> Theresa Ward on September 16th, 2011 8:01 pm <p> I grew up with a 60? s pink bathroom and have often wished it had white tile. It is n't that sweet pale pink ; it 's a strong pink. My sister &; I joked about it being Pepto Pink. I have recently inherited the house with that pink bathroom( and a green bathroom). I really considered " destroying " them both ; my niece convinced me not to. So one night while searching for ideas for the bathroom, I came across the " Save the Pink Bathrooms " website. Now, I am excited about my pink bathroom and the decorating possibilities!! I promise to cherish &; save the pink bathroom!! <p> Amy Ingalls on September 17th, 2011 11:18 pm <p> I love it!

My mother sent me an article out of the St. Louis Post Dispatch ; PRESERVE the Pink. It cited this website. I 've been a lover of pink bathrooms as long as I can remember. I just sold my condo that had 2 pink baths. My rental home has a pink main bath and I tiled the garage bath in 6? pink tile with black trim and feature strip.I 've just purchased my next home that will soon be painted pink along with the pool deck. I just had my loungers restrapped in Turquoise and Pink. I will put a link to this site on my website and do whateveer I can to encourage people to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house was built in 1972....

I would love to see Florida go back to the days of pink and turquoise. <p> I am very excited to become a member of this special group that is dedicated to preserving the heritage of the mid-century era. Thank you for the opportunity to be a part of! <p> Deb on September 25th, 2011 10:00 pm <p> Yep, I take the pledge. Recently bought a 1930s cottage here in north Texas where one bathroom has ancient, dirty, but perfect pink tile walls, bath surround, and countertop. Gray porcelain tile floor, also dirty but perfect. I can imagine the delight that went into planning this bathroom when it was new... the cast iron bathtub and sink are white porcelain. I 'm getting a lot of " Eeeeew, PINK!! " comments as we 're starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can take it. <p> Katie B on September 28th, 2011 12:52 pm <p> My husband and I just bought our first house, a 1958 brick ranch. Four weeks into ownership, we start removing the awful beadboard paneling covering the walls in our main bathroom. What do we discover? Under the beadboard, and three layers of paint, PINK! Perfect bubblegum pink. On the walls. On the moldings. Even on the lightswitch! <p> I could n't be more thrilled, because I was truly disappointed that when we chose our house, it did n't have the iconic pink bathroom. But sure enough, there is one hiding in there! We 're going to completely restore the paint, which may be all we have to do, because the bathroom still has the original almond and gray tile lining the tub area. I 'm in love. <p> foodfunsf on October 1st, 2011 9:40 pm <p> i have a pink and green bathroom from 1924 ===I do n't see any comments re : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tile flooring, VERY " small combination of white and pink. The tiles are subway tiles around the border of the VERY pink/lavendar tub and toilet( almost the color of this site. The toilet is a pressure toilet, no tank! Does anyone have anything like this? I am trying to find a toilet seat cover or where would I look on the toilet or tub for the name of the mfg.? There was a pink pedestal sink, porceline, but sadly it is gone. HELP <p> Karen J on October 2nd, 2011 2:00 am <p> Almost 2 am and I just finished painting my pink bathroom walls with a fresh coat of pink. It goes well with the pink tub, floor tiles, sink and toilet. The house was built in 1968 and it 's all still original. I have just about the same tile as in the sj-masters pic on this site. They do n't make em like they used to! <p> Long live the pink bathroom! <p> Mary McCarthy on October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home with very high quality, midcentury, pink fixtures -- tub, toilet &; sink in excellent condition. I would keep them except the rest of the room has mint green ceramic wall tiles that are mudset( meaning that to remove them would mean that the walls have to come down). Unless someone has an idea for a theme with pink &; mint green, the fixtures will have to be sold. I 'm in Rockford IL. Any rsuggestions? <p> Lindsay W on October 8th, 2011 9:48 am <p> I bought my first home in 2010. It was built in 1961 and it still has the original pink bathroom- I LOVE IT and I will never get rid of the pinkness of it all!! <p> Barbara on October 9th, 2011 3:21 pm <p> I grew up in a small rancher in No. VA where my Mother raised me to hate the baby blue tile with black trim in the main bathroom. When I became working as an interior designer, I had people come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help " disguising " their pink bathroom.... I sat them down, and said to them " you can not HIDE pink tile.... it 's going to be there -- no matter what. You have to EMBRACE it!!!! Have fun with it!!! If you try to hide it, it will always look like something is wrong with your bathroom ". <p> So this past May, my husband and I, moved into a 1951 home in Richmond. It has had VERY little improvements since then. And what do we have???? A PINK bathroom!!!!! Complete with frosted swan tub enclosure and pink and gray boomerang Formica vanity!! Yay!!!! And we have a chartreuse bathroom as well!! Fun!!! <p> Anyway -- We have a non-existent budget so I have simply done plain black linens for the Pink bathroom, with a black patent shaded lamp on the vanity, and vintage pin-up art on the walls. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original vintage pink and black tile and the beautiful intact mosaic tile floor. Only wish the previous owners did n't put one of those bathtub fitters over the tub and wall enclosure. I 'm sure one day I 'll want to pull it off and hopefully see a beautifully intact pink tub and tile enclosure. <p> Kimberly on October 12th, 2011 2:54 pm <p> Count me in! I pledge to do my part to save and protect pink bathrooms everywhere. Goddess willing, I will one day have one of my own to cherish, care for and adore. <p> Jessica McGee on October 17th, 2011 10:35 pm <p> Just bought a 1962 house, with a yellow tub and sink in one bathroom and a white tub/pink sink combo in the other. I plan on restoring them back to their original glory! Realtor did n't get it when I tried to explain how they do n't make awesome tubs and sinks like that anymore! <p> Angel Pickering on October 22nd, 2011 6:29 pm <p> Dear Mary McCarthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom!! They really do belong together, our bathroom has pink tile on the wall with the " border " tile rounded, mudset green. Our floor is a small designed tile pattern..... yep... pink and green! Fixtures are pink, tub, toilet and sink. We just painted the upper wall a " barely there " light green and it is beautiful. Please feel free to email me at angels1pick@gmail.com and I will send you pics of our bathroom. <p> Honor the Pink Bathroom! <p> Angel <p> Angel Pickering on October 22nd, 2011 6:33 pm <p> For Barbara, <p> Where in Northern Virginia were you raised? I also was raised in NoVa and the house you described is EVERY other house in the neighborhood I grew up in. <p> I am happy to make the pledge to save my pink bathroom( well, actually just the tub is left). I live in a tiny two bedroom, one bath 1953 brick rambler in Seattle, WA. All that is left of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I finally realized after looking at boring modern spa bathrroms and then finding this site that the pink tub is here to stay. <p> Now that I made that one decision, I 'll need help picking out the tile and figuring out the vanity. Thanks Pam, for putting this site together. <p> I am a real estate broker in Seattle and work in an area that is primarily mid century homes. <p> I love it when I see the original pink, blue, green or grey bathrooms with matching tub, toilet and sink. I am constantly telling my clients that the best bathroom renovation on this type of bathroom is no renovation. Houses that still have the original bathrooms( plus other architectural and design elements relevant to the era) in most cases are worth more then the house that had some misguided " updates " Granite and vessel sinks are not always the answer. <p> It all started with my Dad 's lemon yellow bathroom, complete with yellow toilet and pedestal basin, and grew into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interior designer I pledge to save as many pink, blue, yellow, green and turquoise bathrooms as humanly possible throughout Sydney Australia! <p> Angela x <p> Susan Pogue on November 15th, 2011 4:43 pm <p> I 'll give up my pink bathroom when they pry it from my cold dead hands! It 's decorated with only framed cute kitten art! <p> Sheila Beers on November 16th, 2011 11:07 am <p> I too like pink bathrooms. My church has the ladies restroom done in pink, and my cousins always have had a pink bathroom for female visitors in their funeral home. Although people visit the funeral home for somber occasions, everyone loves the decor. I also should think girls and young women would love pink bathrooms, especially since many women are living alone during their single years and would decorate their homes to suit their own feminine style. I know a lady in my town who is ripping out all the " hunting lodge " decor since her husband died, and she and her daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Also, with daughters often having their own bath-bedroom suites, one would think girls would want pink bathrooms. I agree too many vintage things are being ripped out of homes, and in a few years people will be looking for these vintage fixtures and other forms of pink decor. <p> Sheila Beers on November 16th, 2011 11:20 am <p> This is addressed to the posters who are struggling with a pink and green bathroom. I would suggest that they go to the fabric store and look for floral prints such as pink roses with green leaves on a white background. Such a fabric would be wonderful for a shower curtain or valence, provided there is a vinyl lining, window curtain and valence set, or a draw-string cover for the toilet lid. They also might make trim from such fabric and sew it onto solid-color towels or a lampshade or use it on a matte for framed wall art. A lady 's or girl 's bath robe that matches the shower curtain also would be fun, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decor. Pink and green are complementary colors, and they can look great together. <p> Christina on November 26th, 2011 10:52 pm <p> We moved from a townhouse to a single family home in NoVA a short while ago and it came with a pink master bathroom. My husband and I giggled, and then cringed when we first saw it... PINK?!?! For Real!?!?! -- at least the toilet and sink are white... *whew*!!! <p> Our initial thought was to rip it out and update it( we had just remodled our townhouse master bath, and going from a big as far as townhouses go in this area spa looking slate bathroom to 1950? s pink was shocking). I bought a black shower curtain and decided to just deal with it for the time being until we knew what we were going to do with it. <p> We have recently decided to tackle the bathroom project, and I kept thinking about this site. Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents bought the house when it was built) told us that her dad always used the pink bathroom -- it was his bathroom( manly, huh?!?!)! I told her that we would take good care of her house, and to me, it meant updating( ripping out and replacing) the bathroom -- but my friend, and next door neighbor, told me, why not just add a fresh coat of paint and add a few white towels and black accents.... For future resale purposes, a newer bathroom would definitely appeal to more people... but there are people out there that are n't scared by pink... so, I thought, what the heck! <p> I have added the black accent rug, and am working on painting 4, 2? horizontal stripes using two different shades of grey( it 's a very small bathroom, so I am hoping it will help the room seem bigger) to match the shower curtain. I spray painted our shelving unit black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) are loving the pink bathroom a lot more now that the painting is almost done!!! <p> I am glad that I found this site and listened to my friend -- it was definitely a cheaper way to " redo " the bathroom while keeping the promise we made to the previous homeowner. <p> When we sell our house, I am going to add a flyer in the bathroom that lists this website and mention that our bathroom has been added as a " Save the Pink Bathrooms! " bathroom! I hope it will encourage future owners to do this same! <p> My pink bathroom is safe from harm. And my blue one is too! Yep, we 've got a His and a Hers. <p> WAC in SavGa on December 5th, 2011 5:10 pm <p> My wife and I have purchased a home with a pink guest bath, a blue master 3/4 bath, and an intact Youngstown by Mullins Kitchen. Before God and this cloud of virtual witnesses, we hereby pledge ourselves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time as they become totally unservicable, and, thereafter, to restore them to the best of our ability. <p> Angela McKinnon on December 14th, 2011 10:27 am <p> As an Interior Designer, I am helping one client at a time save their pink beauties!! There is something about diluting the reluctance of keeping pink tiles, toilets, tubs, and sinks that make us all smile in the end! Cheers to pink! <p> I will not only keep my soon-to-be-mine pink 60? s bathroom, I will even allow my 4 children to use and abuse it. We must let the next generation know of the glories of pink bathrooms. <p> Kathleen on December 22nd, 2011 7:23 pm <p> I had a pink bathroom in a rental apartment years ago -- It had white walls above the tile which the landlord would n't let me paint, but she did let me paint the outside of the medicine cabinet -- it was an older mirrored cabinet with a steel(?) frame around the mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilet seat, and it looked great! Pink and black are fab! <p> I pledge to uphold the virtue of pink bathrooms wherever I encounter them. I will respect original design, era-appropriateness, and the youthful glow that pink bathrooms give our skin. <p> Lisa on December 27th, 2011 10:33 am <p> We purchased our house in part because of the pink and black tile in the bathroom ; we loved the retro look of the room. After a number of years, we determined that we needed to do some remodeling to fix some water damage around the tub/shower area. We procrastinated a long time because we wanted to save the tile. We located a contractor( the fabulous Satoree Design) that we trusted( they had done some work for us in our kitchen) who, in turn, brought in a tile expert who said that he could save half of the tile. Thanks to this blog, we were able to locate B &W; Tile in California who manufactures tiles in retro colors. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tile was really two different, but similar shades of pink. we were able to replicate that color variation by ordering two separate dye lots of the replacement tile. All in all, we( a) fixed the damaged wall ;( b) replaced the floor, toilet, sink and faucet ;( c) removed the tub and created a walk-in shower with sliding glass doors. We could not be more pleased with the results. While the walk-in shower is not to period, with the retro colored pink and black tile, it certainly has that feel. <p> Scott Charles on January 1st, 2012 2:35 pm <p> I pledge to love honour and respect our new pink bathroom! We have just bought a house with an original pink bathroom suite and black wall tiles. I think it 's mid 60? s. With a bit of scrubbing it looks almost new and we intend to keep it. <p> SarahJ on January 3rd, 2012 2:17 pm <p> Recently my family purchased a home in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cookie cutter ranch style houses all built circa 1950. We were somewhat shocked that the house, so modernly decorated, had this retro pink bathroom. Since recently into vintage fashions and dcor, I convinced the family to work with this muted shade of pink with some retro accents. It was until my mother and I started researching online that we discovered such a bathroom is a piece of history!!! <p> Therefore, we the women in 2012 do solemnly swear to keep our original Mamie Eisenhower bathroom pink, nothing but pink, and pledge to spread the awareness to save the pink bathrooms.. <p> Lisa C. on January 3rd, 2012 9:15 pm <p> On my honor, I will try, to do my duty to preserve the original yellow, blue, gray and dusty rose tile and fixtures in my mid-century modern condo bathrooms.

We had to relocate for our jobs broke my heart but you have to do what you have to now days we are lucky we have jobs. Any ways the bathroom is a 60s pink my husband hates it I think it has charm but everything is pink and white i would like to kick it up a little it is kind of plain. has plenty of light and I am going to save it so that 's how I found your site and looking at ideals <p> Michael Tanigawa on January 15th, 2012 7:14 am <p> The house where I lived from 1962 to 1970 in Aiea Hawaii had a pink-tiled bathroom.

I love that bathroom. My parents lived in that house for 60 years. I now own the house and my daughter and her husband live there.

So glad I found this treasure of pink bathroom lovers!

It was a ranch style house built in 1955. And while the wall tiles and floor tiles were pink, the tub, toilet and lavatory sink were blue. Unfortunately my parents sold the house when I was only 2 years old so I have no recollection of that bathroom, but my mom took some old home movie footage of me taking a bath when I was a year old or so and the blue tub and pink tiles on the wall really looked good. <p> Julie on February 8th, 2012 7:04 am <p> I pledge to always love, honor and care for my pink bathroom, til death do us part.

Our main goal is to provide shelter to homeless young adults but, what we are most excited about, is our home restore program. Restoring homes, especially Retro-1950s to 1960s. It is a time and era that I love the most. I have to say though, for the past 25 years, I have been in total disgust with all realtors insisting on home buyers to renovate to modernize. What is wrong with all those beautiful colors that we all loved so much? And modern craftsmanship does not stand up to the wear-n-tear of old. For a country so hellbent on recycling, why are all the Retro Homes disappearing or at least the beauty of interiors ending up in the landfills? It just makes me sad. My next home( very soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink bathroom) and I think the children will love it. So, I will need all the help I can get on where to find everything needed. Please send your ideas.

Period restoration is a passion of mine, and have restored a few houses in my day. I thought my husband shared my passion as he has helped me in the past...... but he hates the pink. A gentle loving man ; we never argue. But he hates the pink! He wants to gut the whole thing and make it beige. Yuk! <p> If I get my way, and I usually do, I will SAVE the PINK. We have decided the bathroom will be the first project. I will post a pic if I win this battle. Wish me luck. <p> Bunny <p> Kelly on February 27th, 2012 4:44 pm <p> Do n't have a pink bathroom.

We are lucky to have a full and half bath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathrooms. <p> Our master bath( half) has pink tile walls and pink tiny tiles on the floor, a salmon toilet that needs to be replaced, and a GHASTLY early 90s replacement sink/oak cabinet, that MUST GO! We are considering putting in a white toilet and white sink, and hoping it will look good with the pink! <p> Our full bath has a pink and grey scheme. Pink tub, grey tiled walls, and underneath some horrible peel-n-stick " tiles " put in a few years ao by the previous owner, there is more of the <p>( cont from previous comment)... there is more of the tiny pink tile such as we have in the master bath. The sink has been replaced with a moderately non-offensive( though not retro) white cabinet sink, and the toilet is a new white toilet. I 'm hoping to scrape up the stick-on tiles and salvage the pink floor.... wish me luck. <p> 50s Pam on March 4th, 2012 10:23 pm <p> luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pm <p> I love my pink bathroom! I live in a 1959 condo in Seattle which was designed as the city 's first International Style mid-rise apartment by a famous New York architecture firm -- and they naturally chose coral pink bath fixtures made by the Briggs company in Abingdon, Illinois.( If you are a collector, you 'll find that Abingdon China vases and other pieces from the 1940s will match perfectly, since they were made in the same factory.) I 've watched other condo owners " improve " their bathrooms by ripping out the pink bath and toilet, replacing them with bland off-white in the manner prescribed by HGTV 's advertisers ; but when my building receives its historical landmark designation, mine will be one of the few originals left. I am now seeking a second home in Florida, and just toured a 1957 home which is pink outside and has an outrageously original pink bathroom -- a major selling point! <p> Kim A. on March 6th, 2012 1:45 pm <p> If I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have two pink bathrooms( and they made them pink voluntarily!)

Will upload photos when I unpack my zebra striped bath mat.... <p> Alyssa Nugent on March 10th, 2012 1:31 am <p> So my great uncle and his parents have owned a turn of the century duplex since the mid-40s. No one has lived in the downstairs apartment since about that time. Recently, me and my dad decided it was in our best interest if I was to move into the unoccupied space. The bathroom looks a traditional pink bathroom, complete with plastic pink tile and black plastic bull-nose caps to finish it off. My dad looked at it, looked at me, said it wont be that hard to get rid of, and kept walking. I stopped dead in my tracks and told him if he touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill him. Pink bathroom is here to stay!!! <p> Our 1951 house has a pink bathroom with a pink sink, but someone replaced the floor tile at some point, so a goal in life is to find the perfect floor tile that will complete the look. Just so you all understand, we also kept the entirely original pink kitchen complete with stove and counters etc, and pinkified it even a bit further by making the cabinets pink, as the metal ones had been replaced. <p> 50s Pam on March 14th, 2012 11:16 am <p> Patty, try World of Tile in Springfield, New Jersey. Search them on my main site, RetroRenovation.com, and you will see lots of stories and lots of photos -- including lots of great vintage pink floor tile possibilities -- TRUE VINTAGE! <p> Joan on March 16th, 2012 3:59 am <p> I 've owned my 1964 home for twelve years. One bathroom is pink( tile, tub, toilet, sink) ; one is blue( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is green( tile, toilet, sink). Since I moved in I 've considered these semi-permanent fixtures as something to be endured, but now I am ready to EMBRACE the PINK! <p> Lorie Armendariz on March 17th, 2012 6:30 pm <p> We are placing a bid today on a 1960 ranch style home in southern California. It has a pink bathroom! The tub, sink and toilet are all matching pink and in excellent condition! I hope we get this house. My husband said that the pink bathroom would have to be the first thing to go. Well, he 's wrong. I will fight to the death on him with this... and I will win! I am soooo excited about the house and the awesome pink bathroom, If we get the house, the pink bathroom will be the first thing I will fix up( strip down the wallpaper and floors, add some cool new tile and paint and fixtures). Wish me luck!! <p> 50s Pam on March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frances on March 18th, 2012 11:23 am <p> I pledge to keep my 1954 pink bathroom &; kitchen. The selling point on the house was all the pink bathroom fixtures, pink tub ith Swan glass sower doors, celing fan and kitchen counter tops. I am redoing the bathroom in the sense of maintaining the awesomeness of the 1950? s era. My only problem is finding colors for the walls that will not drown out the pinkness. <p> Colleen Pollard on March 20th, 2012 2:01 pm <p> I love pink bathrooms and vow only to add cute things that make them even more fun. <p> I purchased a home that was " thrown " together. The home was built in ' 75, but has a pink bathroom. The appliances need " help " and refurbishment but It will stay PINK forever. <p> The difficulty is finding " parts " like a pedastal for the bowl of the pink sind, or a matching pink toilet seat for the 1960? s American Standard( long) comode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the most important part of the house! <p> Regina <p> Anne on March 20th, 2012 10:16 pm <p> Just bought a house with a pink tile powder room on the first floor. Looking for ideas to retain the character, but also update it in a cool way. Unfortunately, the previous owners updated the vanity, lighting and cabinetry in the eighties, so I am looking to bring it back to its original glory. <p> One idea -- I saw a similar pink tiled powder room wallpapered with vintage maps that was amazing -- I never realized how much pink you see in maps until walking into that bathroom. <p> 50s Pam on March 20th, 2012 10:48 pm <p> Hi Anne, and congrats. I suggest you head over to my main site, http : //retrorenovation.com, and start digging in -- lots of great ideas there, daily! <p> My husband and I are buying our first home. The house we picked out has a pink bathroom and at first, we wanted to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and especially after seeing this site), we want to embrace our pink bathroom.

Thank you for convincing me not to ruin my beautiful bath <p> Shirley on March 28th, 2012 6:08 am <p> I pledge to keep my 1.5 pink bathrooms. We moved into our 1957 home three years ago. While I love pink, I was n't sure about our pink bathrooms. I thought they might get an update in the future but just could n't bring myself to realistically think of doing anything to these pink and brown tiles that cover the walls and floors. <p> I think they 've definitely grown on me and now I have pink bathroom love. I love the great ideas I 've seen about decorating pink bathrooms. I had n't given it much thought other than painting the walls a very light pink to accent the tiles. However, after seeing pictures of other pink bathrooms, I 'm ready to get busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Save the Pink Bathrooms. <p> We just bought a house with a pink bathroom. The floor tiles &; walls are all pink accented with the black. We were looking into painting it or something prior to moving in.... which is May 17th 2012.... I am a hippie chick and my mom said to leave it &; go retro. The more I thought about it, the more I LOVE the idea. I hope to get some great ideas from everyone here. I would be more than happy to listen to any and all your suggestions! SAVE THE PINK!!! <p> Angela Clark Brauneller on April 2nd, 2012 5:08 pm <p> We bought a cape cod style home in Madison, WI last year and it has a Mamie Pink bathroom down to the tiles and fixtures. Even a pink light! I am so in At first it was a bit overwhelming, I must confess. However, it has grown on me and now I kinda love it! <p> Talitha McDougall on April 4th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased our first home. it was built in the early sixties and does indeed have a beautiful pink bathroom, which I absolutely adore. <p> We are slowly completing rennovations/repairs as we can afford to, and I have a query which you may be able to help me with.The vanity is laminate and seems to have lost some of its colour, when it is wet however the colour is quite vivid( black with gold and silver speckles) does this mean we could get some sort of clear coating put over the top to bring the colour back? Just thought I would ask before I went and did something I would regret. <p> Thanks, love your work. <p> Wendy Johnson on April 4th, 2012 3:27 pm <p> I will stand by the pledge to save the Pink Bathroom. You all have inspired me. I moved into my 1957 home last February. I was thinking seriously about remodeling it and taking out the Pink tile, but not now. I 'm keeping it. I 'll post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Standard! Thanks everyone for your input and willingness to preserve! <p> Just found your site, what a riot!!!! I will send a photo of the bathroom that insoired the search.... It is pink and green. <p> 50s Pam on April 5th, 2012 8:49 am <p> Please do!!!! <p> Nifty-Fifty on April 5th, 2012 10:55 am <p> I bought a 1958 Ranch-style home with Pink bathroom 20 yrs ago and the only change the previous owners( who in their 90? s) did to it was placing god-awful carpet down with glue. I ripped out the carpet to find the original and fabulous dual-shade pink tile -- once I found that, I did n't mind the hours of scraping the glue off the floor. <p> Many years ago I painted the walls a slate-blue color and was pretty happy with results but now I 'm having to do some ceiling repairs and I 'm considering repainting the wall a pale( but rich) gray. If the gray does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> BTW : My master bath is all original too but it has sand-colored wall tiles topped with chocolate brown trim tile and tri-colored( dark browns and tan) floor tiles. I find this room much harder to decorate( especially wall color, which is currently a rich gold) than the pink bath. <p> I look forward to some great ideas here -- I 'll post a photo of my pink bath <p> I pledge to never remodel my vintage bathrooms! While I was not lucky enough to get a PINK bathroom in our 1958 Ranch, we did get a light grey with a Cinderella corner bathtub and a light blue one. We painted the grey bathroom pink on the wall and got pink towels so I could have my pink ' 50? s bathroom! We love 1950? s style and would n't change ours... but I also pledge to try to make others keep theirs! Love Retro Renovation! <p> Caryn on April 6th, 2012 1:14 pm <p> I pledge to save pink bathrooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avocado green Jack-n-Jill bath and a white with gold flecks master bath that I am saving in our 1970 ranch! I cringe when I see some of the beautiful colored tile before pics on some of the home/diy blogs I read, and then the horrid afters when the lovely tile is gone, gasp!! When we bought this place last year and were getting estimates for interior painting, kid you not EVERY contractor that came in told me how I could **29;10759;TOOLONG both bathrooms. What 's funny is that I did not ask any of them for an estimate on doing anything to either bathroom... guess they were just all in shock that somebody would live with it in the original state, much less like it!! I love my vintage bathrooms!!! <p> Shelley on April 6th, 2012 9:37 pm <p> I have a pink bathroom that will NEVER be removed unless an act of God strikes my house. I love and embrace my pink bathroom and pledge to defend it and always love it! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9:41 pm <p> We bought a 1955 brick ranch in Atlanta in late 2011. It had been rented and then closed up for several years, but we could tell the previous owners had loved and cared well for the house. It came complete with 1 pink and gray bathroom, and 1 green and gray bathroom, with all original tubs, toilets and sinks in white. At first I was just looking for decorating ideas because we knew we could n't afford to renovate right away, but after I found this site I realized that I truly did LOVE our new pink bathroom. And besides, the tile was in mostly perfect condition after nearly 60 years! I ended up painting the walls a paler shade of pink and adding gray accents. We did have to replace the toilets in order to be more environmentally( and water bill) friendly. The green bathroom got gray walls and black and white accents. Recently, my fiance asked me what I would like to do to the bathrooms if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave them just the way they were! <p> 50s Pam on April 6th, 2012 9:53 pm <p> Love you back, Elizabeth! Even though YOU have a Cinderella bathtub and I do n't! xoxo <p> 50s Pam on April 6th, 2012 9:54 pm <p> Yikes, beware the uninformed contractors! After he helped me with my aqua kitchen, my contractor is now totally into the retro! Thanks for your pledge, Caryn! <p> 50s Pam on April 6th, 2012 9:55 pm <p> Thank you, Shelley! I think God will not do anything to harm your pink bathroom! <p> 50s Pam on April 6th, 2012 9:56 pm <p> Your bathroom is lucky -- and so is your fiance! No need to renovation perfectly beautiful -- and functional -- bathrooms. Pay down the mortgage instead! <p> Alan on April 8th, 2012 2:59 pm <p> I am in the process of buying at 1951 ranch house. It 's an estate sale, but my understanding is that it only had one owner. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, toilet, with pink and grey floor tiles and light gray border where your background photo has black. <p> The bathtub has no shower in it -- since there 's a separate stall shower, I 'm not sure we need one, but the bathtub is sort of a waste of space at that point. <p> It 's also got a 1950s pink sink with 4 legs( exposed plumbing) and not a whole lot of storage under or on top -- thoughts on storage -- some sort of shelf, I guess, but any ideas where to get one. <p> To make it more " masculine " for the male users, the idea is to give it a 1950s surf theme -- teal paint, tin vintage surf posters, Hawaiian-themed curtain etc. <p> My partner and I are seeking to put a 50? s themed bathroom back into our powder room and master bathroom( which were remodeled in 1970. Love your website. Hope we can save every vintage bathroom( and kitchen) across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pink bathroom and am trying to preserve it, but its a challenge. All of the tiles and porcelain look tired -- toilet( really quite worn actually), sink, bathtub, tiles around tub( all a deep seashell pink). Vanity bottom woodwork is brown wood. Vanity top is faux pink marble. Floor linoleum is totally old and worn. I am on a tight budget, but I want to revivify the room. I think I want to paint all of the woodwork white, put down a white tile floor, and wallpaper with French poodle/Eiffel Tower wall paper( replacing the current seashell wallpaper). I have tried all sorts of cleaning products for the tiles, but nothing rally works. Any advice? I know some will think it is blasphemous to paint the woodwork white, but I need bright! Thoughts?

I think I may wait till I am in and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on April 10th, 2012 6:10 pm <p> I recently remodeled by Pink Bathroom and despite almost everyone telling me I should tear out that Horrible Ugly Old Tile, I kept it.

I love my Pink Bathroom and I am so glad I listened to my heart on this one. <p> 50s Pam on April 10th, 2012 6:42 pm <p> Hi Diana, paint away if it brings the woodwork back to life! You might look at Rustoleum Cabinet Transformations -- I have a few stories on my blog. Regarding cleaning the tile, sorry, I am not really an expert, and even if I were, I think it would be hard to diagnose here over the intertubes. Please know that if you start ripping stuff out -- you should consult with a licensed professional first. There can be asbestos in old resilient flooring including in adhesives... Basically, any time you deal with a new/old layer -- be sure you know what you are working with. Renovate Safe. Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6:42 pm <p> We are glad you did, too. &lt;3 <p> Donna Gill on April 13th, 2012 11:00 am <p> I am moving into a lovely home that has been well maintained and has a very beautiful pink bathroom. Pink tile, pink tub, pink toilet, and pink sink! My daughter and I can hardly wait to start decorating this precious gem. <p> Love your website. <p> 50s Pam on April 13th, 2012 11:25 am <p> Congratulations!!! <p> Sandy Fish on April 13th, 2012 9:00 pm <p> Indeed! Save the pink -- IF you are LUCKY enough to get one! Sadly ours was plain ol ' white by the time we got our house, a bad 70? s " up-grade ". Our entire master ' area ' has beautiful travertine marble floors, so sadly no hex tile for me. I have elected to do bead-board wallpaper( on one wall) and paint on the walls. I pledge to paint my walls and maybe even my new clawfoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selections, vintage designs of course and there will be pink in the paper <p> My husband and I bought a 1957 ranch last year in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. We have two beautiful bathrooms that are completely typical of the era -- pink and green! The link above is to a picture of the pink bathroom. The wallpaper is original and was covered by a boring wallpaper that was n't difficult at all to remove. The wall on the left side was n't wallpapered for some reason that I do n't understand. It 's a work in progress. The next things I plan to do are replace the white toliet seat cover with a pink one, and find a curtain for the window and a curtain for the bathtub. I love this site -- thank you for your work! It 's a wonderful place to get ideas. <p> i have a pink washroom too, love it, I 've changed the sink for a newer one still pink, and have a spare pink toilet in my basement, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all work. my buddies hate it. found your site now i 'm not alone, long live pink <p> stacey hamilton on April 18th, 2012 10:52 pm <p> We just moved into a rental home with the COOLEST original pink and black tile bathroom. It 's very MadMen looking. It does need some TLC, things are cracked, rusted, etc. but I would n't mind splurging a little and helping it live up to its full potential. Very happy to find this site!! <p> Annie on April 21st, 2012 8:06 am <p> Just over two years ago, I bought a 1961 cottage in Brisbane, Australia. Original kitchen and bathroom, complete with original plumbing, ugh! The bathroom has pink tile floor and pink bath. Grey shower recess( which I imagine would have originally been a very light pastel purple) and sky blue tile around the bath. Original vanity was replaced, looks like sometime in the 90s, with a very boring white one. I could n't deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over white just over a year ago. I regret it a little now though <p> The pink bath is simply amazing, the pink tile floor needs a lot of love. I 'm a seriously retro girl and have just renovated my kitchen to 1960s perfection, I 'm in two minds about the bathroom. The Mamie in me could n't live without it..... but it needs a massive overhaul. I pledge that I wo n't destroy it.... but I also pledge that I will revitalise it. <p> Starting now. <p> 50s Pam on April 21st, 2012 10:58 am <p> xoxo, Annie, you go girl! <p> Carmen Konigsbach on April 21st, 2012 12:47 pm <p> I am so happy i found your site. We purchase our 1954 ranch house 11 years ago. I told my husband that we would renovate the bath rooms. Master bath is Mammie pink and in glowing condition( except for the oak cabinet and vanity). The main bath is completely covered in the period blue. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep my pink bathroom pink and replace the odd ball items with period once when found. BTW my family name is appropoe ROSADO.

I have no plans to change anything in the bathroom, other than working with what I have, the color pink! I am ready to be proud of my pink bathroom!!! <p> 50s Pam on April 22nd, 2012 11:39 pm <p> Congratulations, Chelsea! <p> tina on April 23rd, 2012 4:00 pm <p> I do n't know what I was thinking! The house we bought had a pink bathroom and I painted over the tiles with brown paint. I 'm in the process of removing the paint and returning it to the original color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. When i came across the website it gave me even more motivation to finish it! <p> jeanne on May 2nd, 2012 12:52 pm <p> I 'm face-lifting my 1964 pink bathroom and the pink tiles are staying in place! New floor( gray/black,) new countertop( gray-black-white,) new toilet( white, with black lid,) and repainting the non-tiled walls( ivory.) I 'm also keeping the old built-in cabinets with louvered doors -- I 've painted them black. Planning for at least one black-and-white photo poster on the wall. I think it is turning into a French new wave powder room. Sort of like Mamie wandering through a Goddard movie. <p> But would anything but pink tile have inspired me in such a manner? Of course not. <p> Kristin on May 4th, 2012 11:03 am <p> After 17 years of living in this house( NJ), I love the pink and black master bath. Today I am shopping for replacements to ensure we keep it just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2012 12:54 pm <p> World of tile sells the replacements for $12 each. jascos down the street seels for $1. <p> Mary-Ann Young on May 6th, 2012 6:38 pm <p> Ahhh I do n't care what they all say! Well the time has come to do some upkeep on my 1957 bungalow. I bought this house because of the style, I love all the retro things in it. Thinking that maybe I may sell in the next few years my grown sons, carpenters &; reno specialists were going to do the work I could not. I have the Pink bathroom, sadly none of the tile work. Bathtub and sink remain. After much arguing with my youngest about gutting it, which I refuse to do because I have a wonderful cast iron tub which holds the heat for ever. I decided I will do what I want and if I sell they can do what they want with it! Unfortunately there are no reno-reuse stores here anymore, they started selling mostly new. So the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. With each discovery come a touch of joy. Reno season is upon us, so I have printed a flyer to deliver to homes in my neighbourhood, put a few up at stores and put out the word to all I know. As I type this I am soaking the backing from my lino which I just ripped out to see that the original flooring is. Looks like black marble pattern vinyl tile. Here 's hoping it is in good shape so I do n't need to cover it up Good luck to all in your pink pursuits!!! <p> Lisa Marie on May 16th, 2012 7:52 pm <p> I just bought a condo in Long Beach, California that was built in the 50? s and the guest bathroom is ALL pink! I LOVE IT! While I have to tear out the master bathroom due to some major wood rot, I am hoping to save the pink shower tiles and sink to reuse when I remodel it. While my girlfriend would love nothing more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staying and I could n't be happier! <p> Laurie on May 16th, 2012 11:09 pm <p> I grew up with a pink and grey bathroom( mint green in my parents MBR). When I walk into mid-century ranch homes for sale, I always point out the selling feature opportunity created by the presence of a pink bathroom. Sadly, the real estate agents look at me like I have two heads. It brings a tear to the eye to know these fabulous and timeless potties are being ripped out and replaced with faux zen in a box. Stay strong! Save the Pink Bathrooms! <p> Roy on May 20th, 2012 10:59 am <p> About 8 years a ago i inherited a 50? s home with retro kitchen and bath( pink tile) over time i became educated to the history of this decor. Good thing i could not afford a makeover back then, or i would have screwed up a perfectly good retro home. Ok, Now i can afford this makeover and am glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer, including this website. I have preserved the pink bathroom and am now in the process of a redo, so wish me luck. <p> 50s Pam on May 20th, 2012 11:06 am <p> Is n't it *good* we did n't have the money to make fast changes? Good luck, Roy! <p> Jennifer on May 21st, 2012 12:14 pm <p> I live in the house that my great-grandparents built. It 's like living in a time-warp. Our bathroom is pink with blue trim, blue tub, sink, and toilet. And blue floor. I have always wanted to change it, but never had the money. We did have to replace the sink and toilet, but still have the tub. Who knew there was such a resurgence in the retro house. Maybe I will just re-grout the tile and learn to love it. I also have knotty pine walls, and kitchen cabinets that will never be changed. <p> Just when did this pink bathroom phase really start? I own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fabulous flamingo pink tile walls and 1? hexagonal white floor tiles. Anyone else, of this age home or older, have a fabulous pink bathroom? If so, it would be interesting to know in what areas of the country it first took hold and when. Think pink. <p> JAMES WEDDLE on May 28th, 2012 1:42 pm <p> My parents built a fairly modest tract ranch in 1958 with a bright turquoise/black tiled main bath and a bright mint green master bath. Several neighbors had pink tile. Our stylish aunt and uncle also built in 1958... a pink brick house with pink tiled baths and bright yellow kitchen built-ins and appliances. Their Christmas tree was always flocked pink with plain pink glass ornaments and spot-lit in a picture window with sheer priscillas. I always wanted a pink tile bath and finally got one in 1980 in an apartment in Dallas... also with a pink brick exterior. A star-burst chandelier hung in the breezeway directly over my front door, My bath was the slightly salmon- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a pebbled glass tub enclosure. I accessorized with red. How I loved it. My best friends live in a very stylish mid century ranch with a pink tile main bath and they can only talk of some day getting rid of the pink tile. In my less stylish duplex of 1948 I can only think of replacing the retro-fitted insipid blue tile with my beloved salmon-tinged pink. <p> We just bought a 50? s home with a spectacular pink bathroom!! Love it and ca n't wait to decorate it! <p> PinkieQueenie on June 9th, 2012 11:20 am <p> To my shame my husband made me tear out my pink guest bath when we bought our 1961 built house. I am going to redeem myself by renovating my guest bedroom/bath to it 's former pink splendour. Wonder where to look for a pink commode... <p> Becky Mancuso on June 11th, 2012 7:40 pm <p> Let 's hear it for history! I have a wonderful 1950 pink bathroom and I 'll never get rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2:27 am <p> We recently bought a 1958-built home in Virginia Beach. A few weeks ago I noticed the white paint by the tub drain was flecking away to reveal pink porcelain! Apparently when the house was built this bathroom was Mamie Pink and sometime in the last 50 years a previous owner decided to renovate and rip out and paint over all traces of pink. Shame on them! Now that I know what 's under the peeling paint in the tub, that 's going to be stripped, a pink sink will be reinstalled and the gawd-awful matching Greek blue tile on the floor and walls( the sound you hear is me retching) will be yanked out. In their stead, splendid pink wall tiles and flooring will make their triumphant return. This I make my solemn vow. SHMG. <p> judstep on June 12th, 2012 6:25 pm <p> We have a 1937 Tudor home with the original pretty shade of pink and black bathroom. No cracks, chips or stains. I did have to replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chose to replace the sink also so there would be a match in color and style. I was able to find a close match.

This bathroom was built to last! <p> Carole Carter on June 13th, 2012 3:32 pm <p> We have lived in our 1950 era bi-level for 27 years always contemplating " remodeling " our pink bathroom. Came to the computer to see if something could be done to modernize it and came across this website. Now I 'm thinking of embracing it and using my imagination and my husband 's skills to turn it into something pink and beautiful. Thanks for the site and ideas. I take the pledge. <p> Laurie V on June 20th, 2012 4:18 pm <p> ' Cause today it just goes with the fashion -- Pink, it was love at first sight Yeah pink, when I turn out the light And pink gets me high as a kite And I think everything is going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be my flamingo ' Cause pink, it 's a new kinda lingo Pink, like a deco umbrella <p> Yes, absolutely, save the pink bathroom. I belong to a mid-century modern group in Portland Oregon. I own an early Burkmeyer( Portland, OR architect) 1937 home with a pink and turquoise tile bathroom and I love the old tile, no one 's touching it while I 'm alive. I also have a light bluish turquoise kitchen. My husband and I constantly wonder what happened to style???? Homes, cars, clothes. Nothing beats the level of design, style, and shear class the mid-century era gave us. I also believe there is a resurgence of this era coming back. <p> As a Realtor I see many pink bathrooms and lots of other colors too!! I always try to encourage my buyers to love the original and renovate to period to preserve the vintage... Most do- but there are always the homes that have already been destroyed by flippers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booo!!! I will continue to sing the praises of pink tile. <p> Cheryl on June 27th, 2012 4:04 pm <p> The sweet 1940 Lannonstone ranch we 're hoping to buy has not only one, but TWO lovely, vintage pink bathrooms in it! The main bath has pink tile with black trim, and the master has, get this, black tile with pink trim and fixtures( plus a pink trimmed, diamond gridded, tall casement window over the tank). Gorgeous. Lots of other vintage goodies too -- like a yellow and turquoise tiled kitchen with gridded floor-to-ceiling picture window in a nook overlooking the backyard, 4-season room with 3 walls of windows and french doors off the dining room, and an offset detached garage( on an angle on the property). Amazeballs. I hope we get it. I can only imagine how just about anyone else would rip out all these fantastic finds to update and flip. No updates needed! Well, maybe some MCM vintage wallpaper <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I rent a house to a single mom and her two children and they HATE the pink bathroom tile. They have been after me to re-tile, but I stand firm. I pledge not to change the pink bathroom. I 'll change the grout because it 's mildewed, but the pink tile stays! I should be charging extra rent for such a beautiful bathroom! <p> Nora Breuer on July 10th, 2012 3:06 am <p> I pledge to keep my pink bathroom! <p> Erin Ward on August 19th, 2012 4:31 pm <p> Hubby and I bought an early 1900? s home that had been added onto in the 1950? s. The bathroom had no sink and horrible beige 12? rough cut floor tiles surrounding a lack luster early 90? s tub insert. We so wanted to gut it and go for pink, but it was cost prohibitive( we still needed a kitchen). So we did the next best thing, porcelain tub with black &; white tile surround and pale baby blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ". <p> Jay Beck on August 19th, 2012 9:17 pm <p> WOW! I am SO glad I found this site! I bought my 1954 ranch about 16 years ago... and with it came a PERFECT pink bathroom. Demo was VERY far down on my list... and as time went on I found myself unable to do it. I just ca n't demo something that is in such good shape!... and now i find that the old pink... is now IN! I did get rid of the " car fin ' like light fixtures! <p> Angie Alzola on August 25th, 2012 1:16 pm <p> I am so glad I stumbled upon this site! We have a 3/1 50? s veterans ' special in Miami.

Good luck to others! <p> I pledge to save the yellow and pink bathroom in our 1966 home. The last " lady of the house " unfortunately ripped out the pink tile! When we did our walk-throughs before purchasing( we just closed on the 30th!) I saw the original tile in the closet and linoleum in the rest of the bathroom. I thought it was hiding the tile.. I just pulled back a threshold to find that she ripped it all out!!!!!!!!! So disappointing! Along with the yellow tiled walls and awesome white and gold deco liner tiles, at least she left the pink/mauve toilet, tub, sink, original Formica marble counter top, and original gold-trimmed wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tub( not sure of their proper name) are still there!

Our pink bathroom is in perfect condition so we never remodeled it. As a last ditch effort I though I would check on line for some decorating ideas to modernize the bathroom. I found this wesite and I 'm really pleased!! I do n't have to change my pink bathroom!! <p> I found the perfect wall color to go with the pink -- gothic rose -- very dark rose color totally modernizes the tiles. I added a black granite counter top and a large framed black vanity mirror. The tub was upgraded and glass doors installed. The look is perfect. I 'm thinking of stenciling " Save the Pink Bathroom.com one the walls for fun!! <p> We purchased a large historic home in our town. We pledged to try to restore as much as possible. I was not happy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rehab Addict 's facebook page, someone linked me to your page. I come to find out I have a classic Mamie Eisenhower pink bathroom!! I had planned on keeping the fixtures but resurfacing them white and gutting out the pink and yellow tile and putting in white subway tile. I had no idea what a gem we have. I will be SAVING the pink bathroom!!! <p> Your website got a mention in today 's Key West Citizen( 9/16/12). We bought and renovated a great little mid century mod house in Key West that was built in 1952 from the original owners who, thankfully, kept most of the original features including natural Florida cypress ceilings and Cuban tile floors... and, of course, the PINK BATHROOM. Much to the dismay of most who see it, it is still there. This is the second pink bathroom that we have saved. <p> Maureen Bramlage on September 16th, 2012 9:28 pm <p> I 'm saving mine.

I was on the fence for two years over a total makeover vs the above rehab, and only just decided a couple months go which way to go. I 'm thrilled to hear that I am not alone. <p> LiLo on September 16th, 2012 9:52 pm <p> We just put in an offer on an amazing 1950-built home with a beautiful retro pink full bathroom and a wonderful retro lime green master bathroom.

For many years I thought long and hard about how to " remodel " this bathroom. Luckily, I found your website and have decided that I really and truly love the pink. I too have watched HGTV and winced at all the so-called experts who are busy changing everything to look " modern ". Tan and granite and stainless steel.... BORING! Our house even has(gasp) walnut paneling in the dining room. That 's staying too. When I croak, the next lady of the house can do as she pleases. For now, I will do as I please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pm <p> I love pink bathrooms. I am working on the house in which I grew up and will soon( I hope) be living in again. The only pink bath is a painted one, but I confess to being jealous of my cousin who has the real deal! I do have 3 wonderful tiled bathrooms. One in white/burgundy tile, a half-bath in two-tone blue tile and one in green and yellow tile. Love ' em. <p> Jaryn Thompson on October 8th, 2012 3:21 pm <p> I have TWO pink bathrooms!!!

My son calls it " the girl 's potty " although the bathroom has officially become my husband 's bathroom. I love our pink bathroom and almost cried this weekend when my son broke the toilet seat off the hinges when he was standing on it. I found your site when searching for a replacement toilet seat. We love our pink bathroom and wo n't be renovating it ever! <p> We are new owners of a small mid-century house in Wheaton MD and proudly have a pink half bath in our basement! The floral wallpaper is absolutely adorable and the tiles are a sandy pink. It has all the old fixtures( sadly our chrome soap dish is corroded) and is absolutely pinktastic. When I find my camera I 'll be sure to post pictures. <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to put in some of that gorgeous mid-century feel into it. It was renovated in the 90s into a bland white and is absolutely boring and difficult to keep clean. This one will probably be green or blue, but hopefully we 'll be able to bring back the mid century aesthetic into our house. <p> Ha! Thanks Sally Myers for encouraging my pink bathroom save! Love my old pink bathroom and am thrilled to see others are so inspired! We have a pink tub, toilet, and wall tile. We are using it to remodel around instead of over.

Pink wall and floor tile, pink sink, pink toilet and square pink tub. Throw in a thin row of green accent tiles and.... the main attraction... a hand painted tile mural above the tub of lily pads and swans. It does n't get any better than this. The only thing needed to place the crown on this lady is a good scrub and some vintage matching wallpaper. <p> Debora Beals on October 25th, 2012 1:02 am <p> I was lucky enough to live in an original 50s bldg with both pink-tiled bathroom and kitchen ; I added pale blush painted walls to enhance the glow. So glamorous and comforting.

Our MCM home was flooded last year and we are doing everything we can to retain the spirit of the home. My bathroom had/has Crane fixtures, in pink( of course) -- tub, toilet, and sink. We saved all the fixtures but the sink is too wide for modern-day cabinetry( the old cabinetry was angled so that the counter-top surface was much wider than the actual cabinet width, very atomic, very cool, but custom and beyond our budget after the flood! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have rear-mount toilets in a concrete slab house so replacing the toilets alone would require major renovation -- better to keep the pink!). So I am desperately searching for a pink Crane sink that is not as deep as my old sink but is the same pink as the tub and toilet. The sink we have says the following on the bottom : VIT CHINA and has a date : May 16 1963. I have found a pink Crane sink( at Toldeo Architectural Artifacts) that will fit in the new cabinetry, and it looks like a good match in the photo( but who knows in a photo on a web site!). The very nice woman on the phone says the date on her their sink is 1955, and she is still searching for a Crane color chart. Does anyone out there know if a 1955 pink Crane sink would match a 1963 pink Crane sink? Thanks so much for any help -- ShaunAnne Tangney, Minot, North Dakota <p> Robyn Parkinson on November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mid century home in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales Australia. Our bathroom is original with green fittings, pedestal basin, grey, green and pink mosaic tiles in the floor and green, and pink glass wall tiles. We have painted the walls a very soft green to accentuate the feel of the green in the room. We love it! <p> Susan Smith on November 6th, 2012 3:16 pm <p> I have a pink bathroom and have had the thought to go white! But after finding your site. I will embrace the pink! Thank you! <p> Kim on November 8th, 2012 5:19 pm <p> My parents always had Victorian houses. But my aunt and uncle -- they had the cool stuff! They had the latest, newest things that included a brand new ranch house with a pink bathroom! I loved that pink bathroom! <p> My aunt also had a very frou-frou and expensive pink bedspread. It was floaty and made of embroidered organza, It had layers of ruffles. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, love them, loved that bedspread
