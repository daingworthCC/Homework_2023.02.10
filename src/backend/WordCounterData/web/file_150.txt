5041541 teacher in the suburbs of Chicago. He began writing the Friendly Atheist blog in 2006. His latest book is called The Young Atheist 's Survival Guide. <p> TheG <p> It would have been good to add one of my favorite lines( I forget the movie), " God bless America... and no place else! " <p> Annlumax <p> America has been blessed for too long and looks like he is shifting his blessings elsewhere. Those who do not know how to count their blessings would have the blessings taken away. <p> Luke Allport-Cohoon <p> lol it is n't like any god is actually blessing the US <p> Al <p> Maybe not. Since nothing is blessing US, then the people of US must have been blessing themselves from the misfortune of others. Since you are so sure that there is no god who blessed US, how about compensating those whom blessings have been taken
