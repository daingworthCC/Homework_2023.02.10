5078541 <p> I 've just finished watching Episode 12 of Season 1 of Once Upon a Time. As stated by Henry at the beginning of the series, everyone 's memories have been erased, including the Mayor 's. However, the Mayor is clearly aware that she is the Evil Queen after taking the Huntsman 's heart from its box and crushing it. <p> Later on though, she begs Mr Gold to tell her his real name, even though it is shown that she knew his name when she was the Evil Queen. Does this mean that she does know the truth, but some of her memories are hazy as opposed to fully erased like everyone else? <h> 1 Answer <p> To the question in the body, no, her memories are n't hazy. Regina is the one who cast the curse ; from her point of view, she should be the only one who knows their true identity. <p> Due to Mr. Gold 's actions in previous episodes, Regina had become suspicious that he might actually know who he really is. She had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know he was Rumplestiltskin, he would n't think Regina was going crazy. But if he did know, he would answer as such, confirming her suspicions that he did remember. <p> Yes - after watching Ep 13, it 's clearer now that she is fully aware of everything, as she is actively trying to keep David and Mary apart. As her plan is failing, she encourages Kathryn to leave so something bad
