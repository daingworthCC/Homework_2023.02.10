There are strong, believable characters, which is matched by excellent intrigue and betrayal. This novel is a great example of the historical fiction genre. "( theeloquentpage.co.uk) <h> About the Author <p> James Wilde, the pseudonym of Mark Chadbourn, a two-time winner of the prestigious British Fantasy Award, has written a number of widely praised modern fantasy novels. Wilde lives in the heart of a Mercian forest in England. <h> More About the Author <p> Raised in a world of books, James Wilde studied economic history at university before travelling the world in search of adventure. Unable to forget a childhood encounter - in the pages of a comic - with the great English warrior, Hereward, Wilde returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestral home, where he became convinced that this legendary hero should be the subject of his first novel. Wilde now indulges his love of history and the high life in the home his family have owned for several generations in the heart of a forest. <p> Stonking debut novel that starts at full pelt and never really slows down. I wanted to read this book as it is a time in history I studied so I was intrigued to see how well it would be portrayed. James Wilde brings the hardship, horror and violence of the time to life with bloody realism. It 's a grim time where life is easily and torturously forfeit. Hereward is possibly one of England 's forgotten heroes and this interpretation of his troubled life is well worth the read. <p> Hereward has been wrongly outlawed by his own father, England is in turmoil, under threat from invasion and mercenaries are everywhere. Amongst a slaughtered village he finds Alric, a monk with his own guilty secret. Alric becomes the balancing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes them abroad where Hereward develops into a far superior warrior and leader. I would have liked some more on Alric, the book does focus almost completely with Hereward and the other characters are very definitely secondary. However that really is only a very minor gripe on what was a fast paced, bloody, violent and well written historically accurate novel. All the battle scenes are well choreographed and I physically flinched reading some parts. Not for the faint hearted but if you like your early history, your vikings big and your heroes flawed and fierce this is for you. <p> I did really want the story to carry on, it ends at the start of a very interesting time
