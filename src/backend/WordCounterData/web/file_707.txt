Edited by James Lowder( The Book of All Flesh, Prince of Lies), Worlds of Their Own presents an unprecedented sampler of fantasy and science fiction adventure tales from some of the best-loved and best-known authors in the genre. <p> Worlds of their own is the first short story anthology published by Paizo as part of the Planet Stories line - and its not at all bad. The common thread is the authors involved are( arguably) best-known as writers in " shared worlds " - Star Wars, D &D,; World of Darkness and various others. This is their chance to show what they can do when writing in worlds of their own creation. Generally this is fantasy, but at least one story is hard military sci-fi. <p> Michael A Stackpole has written some really good novels outside of Star Wars - his Dragoncrown War cycle is some of the best fantasy I have read. Apart from that though, I was unaware of a lot of the authors involved, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jeff Grubb 's cloudsailers were a striking concept, which was also well written. <p> Its fun picking which of these stories and settings could support a whole novel. Views on this will differ, but there is no doubt there is some real talent on show. As far
