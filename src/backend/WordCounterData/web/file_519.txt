5078741 <h> ABOUT THIS ALBUM <p> Album Notes <p> Martian Acres is home to an official population of two--Bob Story and Dennis Wanebo--who combined their very different personal and professional backgrounds to create this music they call " alt Boulder. " <p> Their first CD, " Middle of the Night, "( produced with a musical cast including some of Colorado 's brightest lights) brought them the expected joy and satisfaction of a job well done. Two of the songs, " Middle of the Night " and " Dan 's Place "( ROCK and COUNTRY ROCK) quickly found a place in the regular rotation at one of Denver 's premier rock stations : 99.5, " The Mountain. " <p> Another song, " Diamond in the Rough, " went somewhere else entirely... the John Lennon International Songwriting Competition named " Diamond " one of the top ten COUNTRY songs of 2003.( " OK, they 've got rock and country... what else have they got? " Interesting you should ask.) A fourth song, " Water Under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collection " issued by Oasis Records in Atlanta. <p> And on the net? Well, the Middle of the Night CD is selling well. Maybe that 's as it should be. The net has been " very very good " to Martian Acres. The title cut, " Middle of the Night, " has been selected for inclusion in the " best of " CD from VS Planet Radio--which is hardly surprising, since the song was NUMBER ONE ON VS PLANET CHARTS(!) several times during 2004, and was the far-and-away winner on VS Planet 's " power chart.

Alt Boulder...... if that 's country rock with a dash here and there of blues, jazz and folk. Middle of the Night is beautiful. If Dan 's Place does n't put a smile on your face nothing will. Master musicians. Great songs and extemely well recorded. It just does n't get much better than this........ <p> The collaboration of Dennis Wanebo and Bob Story had to turn out great. Bob is the ultimate musician, skilled arranger and the vision guy. You may never listen to a better musician as long as you live. He 's simply that perfect. And Dennis... what to say about Dennis? A dreamer, a schemer and maker of rhymes. The way he turns a phrase still makes me chuckle. And do n't forget the incredible voice of Grace Wanebo. Hopefully, she 'll make it her career.
