5082741 <h> All over the map <p> -The final presidential debate proved that Obama and Romney have remarkably similar visions on foreign policy... or is that no vision at all? Was this debate just entertainment? Why do the candidates continually talk down to the Muslim world? Why did they speak so little about Afghanistan, Palestine, the war on drugs and many other issues? CrossTalking with Micah Halpern, Chet Whye and George Szamuely. <p> Thank God I am European.... and in the European Union an organisation that works for peace with laws. Ask Lord Black of the Daily Telegraph. Maybe George Orwell got it right in his book 1984.... Oceania a country with America and Britain destined to search for oil and not stopping to ask permission or question the morality of this crusade. Americans have become slaves of their own self-righteousness and it no longer makes any sense to the rest of the world. <p> MUSLIMS ARE THE WORLD 'S LOSERS( unregistered) October 25, 2012, 23:45 <p> -1 <p> Just saying the truth. Lowest life forms on the planet. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> ItsHer( unregistered) October 25, 2012, 22:17 <p> +1 <p> Actions speak louder than words. When the actions of these candidates do n't match their rhetoric, there 's a serious issue. WAKE UP PEOPLE. Flying drones into civilian areas is an act of war. The ridiculous topics and lack of detail in debates prove it IS more entertainment than seriousness( especially considering neither one of them do what they say). Providing " humanitarian aid " to countries while arming the rebels, is not spreading democracy. Interveining in the lives of innocent civilians in these countries are not justified. Keeping bases in these countries loaded with US military is NOT withdrawing. Regardless of what comes out of both Obama 's and Romney 's mouths, they can not be taken as fact. They 've proven time and time again that they simply SAY what sounds nice and then do what they like. <p> P.S. Their view on Iran is IDENTICAL to that of Bush 's on Afghanistan. False accusations to justify @
