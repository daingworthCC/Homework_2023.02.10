5100341 <h> Video : This was not a great speech? <h> posted at 9:21 am on August 31, 2012 by Ed Morrissey <p> " This was not a speech designed to move an audience "? All due respect to Brit Hume, who 's watched more of these kinds of speeches than I ever dread to be afflicted by, but I think he may have gone into Mitt Romney 's speech with some blinders on. Hume calls the speech " good " and " solid, " which it was, but it was also eloquent and moving at times, too. Hume is undoubtedly correct that Romney wanted to contrast Barack Obama 's soaring oratory with some plain speaking, but it 's a mistake to think that 's all that Romney had to offer, either. <p> Let 's look at a couple of passages, which are both prosaic and yet inspirational considering current political circumstances. Romney spoke on the immigrant experience, being only two generations removed from it( via Common Cents) : <p> It is what brought us to America. We are a nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great-grandchildren of the ones who wanted a better life, the driven ones, the ones who woke up at night hearing that voice telling them that life in that place called America could be better. <p> They came not just in pursuit of the riches of this world but for the richness of this life. <p> Freedom. <p> Freedom of religion. <p> Freedom to speak their mind. <p> Freedom to build a life. <p> And yes, freedom to build a business. With their own hands. <p> This is the essence of the American experience. <p> And when Romney spoke of the contemporary American experience : <p> And that 's how it is in America. We look to our communities, our faiths, our families for our joy, our support, in good times and bad. It is both how we live our lives and why we live our lives. The strength and power and goodness of America has always been based on the strength and power and goodness of our communities, our families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what makes America, America. In our best days, we can feel the vibrancy of America 's communities, large and small. <p> It 's when we see that new business opening up downtown. It 's when we go to work in the morning and see everybody else on our block doing the same. <p> It 's when our son or daughter calls from college to talk about which job offer they should take.... and you try not to choke up when you hear that the one they like is not far from home. <p> It 's that good feeling when you have more time to volunteer to coach your kid 's soccer team, or help out on school trips. <p> But for too many Americans, these good days are harder to come by. How many days have you woken up feeling that something really special was happening in America? <p> Romney finished by reminding us of what we were and can be again : <p> Everywhere I go in America, there are monuments that list those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no mention of their race, their party affiliation, or what they did for a living. They lived and died under a single flag, fighting for a single purpose. They pledged allegiance to the UNITED States of America. <p> That America, that united America, can unleash an economy that will put Americans back to work, that will once again lead the world with innovation and productivity, and that will restore every father and mother 's confidence that their children 's future is brighter even than the past. <p> That America, that united America, will preserve a military that is so strong, no nation would ever dare to test it. <p> That America, that united America, will uphold the constellation of rights that were endowed by our Creator, and codified in our Constitution. <p> That united America will care for the poor and the sick, will honor and respect the elderly, and will give a helping hand to those in need. <p> That America is the best within each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It 's true that much of Romney 's speech focused on the need for new leadership in the US, which by its nature is a prosaic approach. It 's also true that he followed a truly gifted orator in Marco Rubio, whose own triumph was almost impossible to trump. But I 'd call his speech Anyone who fails to comply with our terms of use may lose their posting privilege. <h> Comments <p> I 'd give Mitt a B+. Not great but it did the job and brought the convention to a successful close. Rubio also was solid -- but neither came close to Ryan in rhetorical power. I thoroughly enjoyed Eastwood. It was a put-down of Obama and a good one. <p> I agree with Brit Hume. It 's not that it was n't a great speech, it 's that it was n't a Conservative speech. Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio talked the conservative talk which made their speeches great. Romney 's speech was " solid " because it made him a guy people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will govern like a moderate and most likely cave to people like Harry Reid. Conservatives want more specifics and have been very patient so far, but still have not heard any. Yes, conservatives can and will vote for him, but we also have our reservations about him being a moderate. There are no reservations about Ryan and Rubio. <p> Getting Romney elected is the first step to stopping the bleeding that Obama started. <p> So sarcasm here. I do n't see anything that will change the trajectory of this race. Obama will " win " the debates because he can yell louder, has the cover of the media and is a better orator. Substance no longer matters in American politics, as it 's all about perception and emotion. <p> Why do you think Mitt went out of his way to say the President is a nice guy... you think he really believes that or is it because he 's tired of being called a racist? Maybe it 's both, I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his speech says a great deal about how worried Team Romney is perception. <p> I also thought Ryan was better at whipping up the crowd. But when you stop and think about it, we are n't after a President that gives good speeches and can whip up a crowd. We are after a solid, stable President with good ideas and the courage to implement them. One who understands and loves America. Not a president that hopes to change the America we love. <p> Romney was speaking to the people not the press. I think Hume and others were looking for grandiosity. I 'm sick of grandiosity.It is too expensive. Romney knows humility and his place. He works for us not the other way around. I 'm tired of politicians ' big dreams. Just let us live our lives in freedom, keep us safe and get out of the way. We 'll create the jobs. Stop government from wasting our money and destroying the future of our children and grandchildren. Romney 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Americans instead of prancing around like some emperor. <p> Mitt was magnificent! If I have a criticism, it was that I felt he was a little too defensive. He spent a lot of time expressing his admiration and support for women in a way which felt like he thought he needed to refute the war on women assaults against him. That 's a nit I 'm picking. <p> The speech was, like Ryan 's the night before, respectful to the voters, forceful and at the same time rational and reassuring. Hearing the first few minutes of Rush today confirmed my opinion that he has knitted the party together by his simple, plain, honest decency and generosity of spirit. <p> It was full of optimism. I loved the line about our kinship with the future. He laid out the basics of his agenda in plain terms. I was so pleased to hear him say that we all DESERVE the opportunities of a free society. He does n't promise riches, he promises the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promising to lower the oceans and heal the planet, he is promising to give us in the middle class the opportunity to help our selves and if successful, to help others as well! <p> I watched Mr. Romney, et al, with a mixed group of people- some of whom had not yet made up their minds. When he was done, they were solidly in his camp. I took a new voter this morning to register, just so they could vote for Mitt. <p> So I would say it may not have been a " great " speech, Mr. Hume. It was exactly what was needed. <p> However, conservatives know that he will govern like a moderate and most likely cave to people like Harry Reid. <p> lea on August 31, 2012 at 12:21 PM <p> Meanwhile if you ignore the manufactured narratives and look at his actual governing history you would see he is more likely to Veto anything produced by Harry Reed. Does Reed have 67 votes for an override because that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved his speech. I was expecting to be bored, but I thought he looked very relaxed and confident. Even my teenaged son listened to it. I guess I 'm supposed to pretend that I 'm too sophisticated to be inspired by a politician 's speech. <p> Can someone tell me if NEWTOPIA is playing at being a " Republican disappointed with a less than perfect candidate and is bracing for the inevitable loss.... sigh ". OR the mythical beast... a " reasonable democrat " just trying to make points to put some pinpricks in the balloon. Either Newtonian is n't that good because the shrill desperation of a paid lefty still oozes through the cracks or the the directions he was given in his assignment to hit the conservative boards just was n't clear enough....... <p> Axelrod-trained troll alert here. I 've never seen a post from this entity before today, and this is clearly a talking point generated from Organizing for America intended to disspirit voters from going to the polls. But this untrained troll overplayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romney is not a great speaker, good, but not great... and he is kind of stiff, and dorky. <p> But, he is accomplished, and I am convinced he will do a great job as President... I am convinced he will make the right decisions for the right cabinet positions, for the right reasons. <p> I am not voting for the " cool " factor, I want someone in that office that is effective, a good leader, and honest leader, a moral ethical man, that has discernment in his choices... and Mitt fits that. <p> I do n't care if he is " stiff " or not a great speaker... when he can put the friendly leaders of countries at ease, and give them hope, and put our " enemy " leaders of countries on edge and create respect, that is who I want in the White House. <p> Obama is a destructive thug and has never been nice. He only loves himself. He does n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has created, the myth of Obama, like Mao or Lenin. <p> Get over yourselves. He is a narcissistic power-hungry destroyer, even of his ' friends '. Only fools fall for anything else. <p> A great thesis on topic will be written for psychology, " Charlatanry like no other ". <p> Schadenfreude on August 31, 2012 at 12:28 PM <p> You 're speaking to the choir here. We know this. I can safely say " we " in this respect. <p> But. Romney is speaking to the low information and " undecideds ". They do n't know what we know and their under-used brains would explode if they were to get too much information in too short a time. Those are who he is saying this pap to. <p> So sarcasm here. I do n't see anything that will change the trajectory of this race. Obama will " win " the debates because he can yell louder, has the cover of the media and is a better orator. Substance no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about perception and emotion. <p> newtopia on August 31, 2012 at 12:23 PM <p> Nice try. Want a hanky? <p> No matter how smart and cute your dog is, you will eventually tire of them running around the house barking, pissing and crapping on the floor, and chewing everything up, much less licking their privates whenever company shows up. <p> Yeah I 'm calling bs on you based on your premise that Obama is the better orator. Anyone who has been subjected to his stuttering air puffs of nothing knows that he can not deliver the same effect he did as a fresh faced freshman senator. As for moderator bias, I would n't count on that this time around. Too many of the in-the-tank types have been pulling away lately, trying to salvage some of their tattered credibility because their gut is telling them Obama is a lost cause. He over promised, under delivered and has been a whiny finger pointing excuse making SCOAMF. <p> Mitt will handle himself well in the debates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't escape it and Mitt will bring his A game. Obama will be lucky to manage a B+. <p> My mouth fell open when Hume made his statement that the speech was OK but not great. I think he has been around too long and has become jaded to any speech by anyone. The entire Fox panel was a little jaded in my opinion and they do not seem to have the perspective of an out of the beltway voter. They all seemed to be trying to tone it down so that they did not appear to be cheerleaders for Romney/Ryan. I can not figure out why the would feel that way since every other media hack is so in the tank for Obama that it is not even in dispute. There were so many good/great speeches that it is hard to remember them all. <p> Tell ya ' what.... For the first time I 'm actually excited by this ticket. The Ryan speech and now Romney 's( who nailed it). <p> Admittedly I had concerns that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed at this point..... but this guy actually had the cajones to MOVE RIGHT unabashadly last night.... combine that with the Ryan choice, and we could lock the NEXT three elections. <p> Then you were n't listening! He is not going to scream and shout, he is talking to us like we are adults! Too bad some of you are n't and you have to have lies and pointing and shouting and tilting your head up so that everyones knows that you are so smarter then all the rubes below you! <p> Romney is a man, who has a tender side for his family, his country and his Church! Women will recognize that and I 'm sure men will too. He is a roll up your sleeve, surround yourself with smart women and men and get the job done! We do n't need a photo op to tell us what we have to do. We will do it. I 'm so excited to see the people he will surround himself with as his cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Britt -- I loved his speech and all the others who came before. We have a life to look forward to. <p> He won me over back when he released his plan last year. He has n't wavered from it and in fact has built upon and reinforced it. By picking Ryan, he put an indelible stamp on the sincerity of his intentions to carry that plan out. <p> A lot of folks were skeptical over his time as Gov in MA. But that was and is a solid, bluest of blue states. He did the best that anyone could there. <p> We do n't need a great speaker. We need a president who loves this country and will work to put it back on the right track. In 2008 people voted for all the utopian rhetoric and we ended up with an inexperienced, thin-skinned, empty suit hack who hides his past, apologizes for America and is determined to turn America into a divided third-world country. <p> I 'm not a big fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be fair and balanced. That act gets pretty tiring when Brit 's commenting on the commie in the White House -- never any hard criticism of the fraud, kind of like O'Reilly. <p> Having said all that, Hume basicly said what I was thinking when it came to Romney 's speech. Good, not great. Solid. <p> My wife on the other hand, felt the way many others here feel : who the hell was Hume watching? The Romney 's have been married about as long as we have, and many of their early experiences hit home with us, big time. They 're very good people! <p> Bottom line : we both loved the convention, and feel very enthusiastic about the election prospects. I was left with the definite impression that this is a man who has my vote, based on all that was said. Frankly, he had it to begin with, but I believe more importantly that he 's headed in the right direction with the undecideds. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the nasty Republican primary process that Mitt went through will bode well for him against O'Commie. <p> Personally, I do n't see the debates as being the thing that decides this at all. I think that it is Mitt 's to lose now. As long as he does n't blow it in the debates, and he wo n't, he will win this election handily! <p> So sarcasm here. I do n't see anything that will change the trajectory of this race. Obama will " win " the debates because he can yell louder, has the cover of the media and is a better orator. Substance no longer matters in American politics, as it 's all about perception and emotion. <p> newtopia on August 31, 2012 at 12:23 PM Nice try. Want a hanky? <p> No matter how smart and cute your dog is, you will eventually tire of them running around the house barking, pissing and crapping on the floor, and chewing everything up, much less licking their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will do what has to be done. Tenwheeler on August 31, 2012 at 1:30 PM <p> SweetThang on August 31, 2012 at 3:10 PM Personally, I do n't see the debates as being the thing that decides this at all. I think that it is Mitt 's to lose now. As long as he does n't blow it in the debates, and he wo n't, he will win this election handily! <p> MJBrutus on August 31, 2012 at 3:14 PM <p>... <p> You sound like a longtime friend who was convinced even before the Convention that Romney wins in a landslide. At this point, I 'm happy to settle for " wins this election handily! " <p> I thought it was a good speech. It was n't overblown and filled with soaring rhetoric like Obama 's speeches were and that was the best part. After four years of hearing about how Obama was going to heal the planet and stick it to the rich and give everyone their " right " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's giving a speech to America and not the rest of the world. <p> Personally, I do n't see the debates as being the thing that decides this at all. I think that it is Mitt 's to lose now. As long as he does n't blow it in the debates, and he wo n't, he will win this election handily! <p> MJBrutus on August 31, 2012 at 3:14 PM <p> I have to disagree in some ways. First, I DO think it is Mitt 's to lose, but its also not as simple as that. First, there 's the DNC. If they can somehow manage to pull away from the hate and smear fest it looks like they are keen to deliver up to the liberal arm of the nation and can somehow swing it to a more " left of center " convention( as we took it to a " right of center " convention)... that could leave a mark against Mitt and for Obama with the electorate. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not many people tune into campaign stop speeches like we do... they DO tune into the debates. If Mitt can eviscerate Obama in the debates in the same way he did at the convention( cool, calm, collected, personable, and direct) he will score major points. But he can not allow Obama to walk all over him with the assistance of the " moderators " either. <p> One thing a lot of people do n't understand about Romney is he is a very focused problem solver. When he performed poorly in the debates the last cycle, he worked on that skill. This cycle, he was the winner or " not loser " of every debate except two. And after Gingrich 's surge, he got help again, and clearly won the next two and ended the Gingrich challenge. <p> Against Obama, he will do well -- and could do even better if he consults Gingrich, or at least studies his debates this cycle. Challenging the media for idiotic questions is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bias and hates the " gotcha " attitude, exposing it wins points with the people who count. <p> Obama did n't win many debates last time. He was able to ride his narrative and the hopey-changey crap and skate by not losing too badly. McCain did n't lose any of the debates, but failed to expose Obama as an empty suit in any of them either. <p> This time the bar is set higher for Obama. He ca n't hide behind meaningless rhetoric, he has an abysmal record to defend and just is n't up to doing it. If Romney is calmly aggressive and assertive and rebuking of the panel a time or two -- just as much for softballs to Obama as to objectionable questions to him -- he can easily gain the initiative and put Obama AND the panels on the defensive. <p> Last night, I was pleasantly surprised when Mitt Romney delivered his speech to the RNC. <p> He was gracious at the beginning ; walking through the crowd and shaking hands with delegates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're all in this together. Then at the end, he wrapped up his speech in what I believe to be the most passionate tone he 's ever demonstrated when saying : <p> " If I am elected President of these United States, I will work with all my energy and soul to restore that America, to lift our eyes to a better future. That future is our destiny. That future is out there. It is waiting for us. Our children deserve it, our nation depends upon it, the peace and freedom of the world require it. And with your help we will deliver it. Let us begin that future together tonight. " <p> Romney 's conviction seemed to come alive. But did he risk its effectiveness for the long term by omitting a few things? <p> Number One : NO Mention of our Military in Afghanistan <p> What does Governor Palin usually do at the beginning of most speeches and what did she do when talking about her own son and others in her 2008 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women in uniform who carry out our country 's humble mission of peace-through-strength across the world. <p> As Bill Kristol pointed out this morning : <p> The United States has some 68,000 troops fighting in Afghanistan. Over two thousand Americans have died in the more than ten years of that war, a war Mitt Romney has supported. Yet in his speech accepting his party 's nomination to be commander in chief, Mitt Romney said not a word about the war in Afghanistan. Nor did he utter a word of appreciation to the troops fighting there, or to those who have fought there. Nor for that matter were there thanks for those who fought in Iraq, another conflict that went unmentioned. <p> To Romney 's credit, he did mention the SEALS in their killing of Bin Laden. <p> Every American was relieved the day President Obama gave the order, and Seal Team Six took out Osama bin Laden. But on another front, every American is less secure today because he has failed to slow Iran 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president, he said we should talk to Iran. We 're still talking, and Iran 's centrifuges are still spinning. <p> But despite the Presidential intervals of George Bush, Barack Obama, and others, it remains a fact that our great men and women who serve in uniform do so longer than the terms served by Washington D.C. politicians. It 's a real commitment to make. That commitment affects families, friends, children, and communities. That 's why it 's an honorable commitment. It 's a lifetime gig and it is no luxury. Our men and women in uniform deserve mention every time a commander-in-chief or one applying for the job stands to address the country -- it 's the epitome of unity. <p> Number Two : NO Mention of the Tea Party <p> In what seemed to be an unfortunate theme of the convention, Mitt Romney was not the only speaker to avoid thanking the Tea Party for all they 've done over the last four years. While nobody sacrifices as much as our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of average Americans who struggled, who suffered hard times and took hits, who got off their couches and took to rallies in 2009 -- those folks had a massive impact on the Healthcare negotiating processes including their appearances at the town halls. These " real people " as celebrated in Sarah Palin 's infamous Tea Party video are n't highly paid political " experts. " They are average Americans -- a lot unemployed or under-employed -- who are tired of the failed social experiments in this country. They also realize for their children to have a better shot at opportunities, we have to get our government under control. <p> Such out-of-control government issues include overspending, crony capitalism, and politics behind closed doors. The Tea Party is a " ground up call to action " and are primarily responsible for many of the speakers who took to the floor over the course of the convention who were more-than-happy to praise the Tea Party when it was their own elections which mattered. But in the course of selecting our next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were basically told to sit back this time. <p> That 's insulting. That 's the truth. And once that " roar of the crowd " fades away, that truth will remain for those same speakers who someday will face election again. They will be dependent on the same Tea Party members they ignored. <p> Number Three : NO Mention of Gov. Sarah Palin <p> In the portion of his speech where he paid homage to his mother, Romney said the following : <p> My mom and dad were true partners, a life lesson that shaped me by everyday example. When my mom ran for the Senate, my dad was there for her every step of the way. I can still hear her saying in her beautiful voice, " Why should women have any less say than men, about the great decisions facing our nation? " <p> I wish she could have been here at the convention and heard leaders like Governor Mary Fallin, Governor Nikki Haley, Governor Susana Martinez, Senator Kelly Ayotte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most telling part of the GOP Establishment 's chill towards the Tea Party was their refusal to mention the proud achievement their party recognized when it named its first female Vice-Presidential nominee in 2008. Before many of the women he mentioned became Governors or Senators, the USA already had a female Governor. And while the Republican Party has its impressive list of women, only one got close to the White House. It was a moment of impact and one of history not just for our country and the Republican Party, but for the future of women in politics forever. <p> To prove the point, Gov. Nikki Haley owes Gov. Sarah Palin a great deal of thanks. It was Palin 's endorsement and strong backbone to defend Nikki Haley during periods of ugly rumors which surfaced during the South Carolina gubernatiorial campaign in 2010. As such Nikki Haley won her election. In addition, both Kelly Ayotte and Susana Martinez were thrilled to receive the endorsements of Gov. Sarah Palin and welcomed her whole-heartedly when she worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respective states to make their dreams of winning these elections become realities. <p> It goes without saying around here how many times Gov. Palin has stuck her neck out for what is right. It also goes without saying that her influence continues to make a massive impact on the House and Senate races this year. Just ask Ted Cruz who won his primary in Texas and talked about the authenticity and effectiveness of Palin 's support just recently. <p> Palin 's strong support and energy is found in the same principles that force her to stay cemented in her convictions -- avoiding the game of D.C. politics and shenanigans. That kind of conviction is Reaganesque, it is Thatcheresque, and there is no Washington expert 's game that can out-live that kind of integrity. <p> To be fair, perhaps Gov. Palin challenged all the primary candidates a little harder than anyone else did. She advocated for a longer and tougher contested primary. Therefore, on a political scale one could imagine why the establishment would avoid the mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party 's first woman to sit on a national ticket at any level and it 's our party 's current presidential candidate 's task to demonstrate ability to put differences aside and recognize what is universal. It 's not a matter of current-day convenience. It 's a matter of the same given respect Governor Palin showed in 2008 when she mentioned Hillary Clinton and Geraldine Ferraro many times. <p> If it 's truly time to unite, it 's the responsibility of the current players to reach out to Tea Party Patriots and Palin supporters to close that hole for longer-lasting party enthusiasm <p> You have copied and pasted that huge chunk of text in several threads now.

She said she was fed up with paying so much taxes to support welfare queens and people who are too lazy to work, while she is struggling with a low paying job, rising gas prices, rising food prices, and now she has to buy health insurance or pay a fine. She watched Romney 's speech and decided, " I 'm voting for Romney because he knows what he 's doing and he understands the economy ". She repeated things from his speech about how disappointed people must be who voted for Obama and how he failed to live up to their expectations. She said she resented how Obama plays golf so much and how Michelle Obama goes on these expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacation because she is struggling not to have to move back in with her parents. <p> She also said that she is pro abortion and pro gay marriage, but right now, that 's not important to her because she is more worried about economic survival than social issues.
