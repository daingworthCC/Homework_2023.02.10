5041941 <p> If the notion that we are merely living through the aftereffects of a mere " recession " that ended in 2009 sounds somewhat ridiculous, that 's because it is. If we were being honest with ourselves, we would call this a depression. That would certainly better convey both the severity of our problems, and the fact that those problems have no evident solutions. <p> The American economy currently has both a short-term problem and a long-term problem. The short-term problem is that the economy is depressed ; it is growing more slowly than the population, with the result that per capita income is declining. The high rate of un- and underemployment is a factor, but is itself the product of other factors, having mainly to do with the reluctance of over-indebted consumers( over-indebted in major part because of loss of equity in their houses, the major source of household wealth) to spend, the reluctance of the impaired banking industry to make risky loans, and the reluctance of businesses to invest and to hire, which is due in part to weak consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's economic future. <p> The roots of this catastrophic situations lie primarily, I think, in the incompetent economic management of the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve. The persistence of the depression, however, is due in part at least to surprising failures of the Obama administration -- poor leadership, poor management, the sponsorship of incomprehensibly complex health care and financial regulation laws that have created widespread uncertainty that has discouraged consumption and investment, and the inability to explain the nature of the economy 's problems to the general public. These failures caused the stimulus enacted in February 2009 to be botched in both in its design and its administration, resulting in the discrediting of deficit spending as a response to depression. <p> So what can be done now? Probably nothing. Anything that involves spending, such as a new stimulus program, would come too late to be effective. Measures that would not involve spending, such as devaluing the currency( which the Federal Reserve could do by buying a great many bonds, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our exports and hence production and hence employment and reduce imports( which would further help domestic production), but they are too risky given the interdependence of our economy and the economies of the rest of the world. Europe is staggering and would be hurt by our devaluing, and our banks and other financial institutions are heavily involved in those European economies. <p> The long-term problem should be easier to solve. The problem is not the federal budget deficit per se, huge as it is. The public debt of the United States, which is what the federal government owes to persons who have lent money to the government( mainly purchasers of Treasury securities), and thus excludes debt incurred to finance entitlements and discretionary spending, is currently $9.7 trillion, with 46 percent of it owned by foreign governments and other foreigners. Although $9.7 trillion is big even for the United States, we can roll it over more or less effortlessly and at very low interest rates, at least at present and in the immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debt but its growth. In the seven years between 2000 and 2007( the last year before the financial crisis that triggered the current depression), the public debt grew in real( that is, inflation-adjusted) terms by 56 percent, the consequence of reckless spending and tax cuts by the Bush administration. Between 2007 and 2012( the debt in fiscal 2012, which ends September 30 of next year, is of course an estimated number), a shorter period, the nation 's public debt will have grown by another 134 percent. The annual increase from 2009 to 2010 and the( estimated) annual increase from 2010 to 2011 are both 17 percent, and the estimated increase for 2012 is 18 percent. These annual rates of growth vastly exceed the rate of the nation 's economic growth even in prosperous times, and if they continue will bankrupt the federal government. <p> Unfortunately, even when the economy recovers, and tax revenues increase, the federal deficit will continue to rise because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security and, because of the health-reform law, Medicaid. Leaving politics to one side, the increase in Social Security costs can easily be controlled, by a combination of raising the age of eligibility, revising the formula for calculating cost of living adjustments, and means testing -- limiting eligibility to persons who do not have substantial other income. Medicare costs are more difficult to control, but not impossible. Medicare too can be means-tested -- there is no reason to subsidize the medical costs of affluent people. Copayments and deductibles can be increased to make people think harder about whether they want expensive treatments of marginal efficacy. Medicare can be transformed, as proposed by Congressman Paul Ryan, from a government- administered heath care program to a subsidy program to enable non-affluent persons to buy private health insurance. And medical research can be refocused on finding cures for medical conditions such as blindness and dementia, which require protracted, expensive care because they create severe disability in the elderly without killing quickly. <p> Efforts to curb increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of which are as enormous as they are unjustified, notably the deduction for mortgage interest. Half the adult population, moreover, pays no income tax. Everyone with an income should pay income tax equal to a modest percentage of his income. <p> So the deficit, politics aside, should be manageable. But it 's worth pointing out that anything that takes money out of the economy, such as reducing federal spending or increasing federal taxes, will exacerbate the current depression. Consumers will have less money to spend, and this will discourage employers from hiring. So the reforms that I have been discussing should be phased in gradually over a period of years. <p> But it 's not clear that we have enough years. Suppose that the economy recovers by the end of 2012, and in 2013 and subsequent years grows at a 4 percent annual rate.( The long-term growth rate is about 3 percent, but growth is usually more rapid when it starts from a low level.) The public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent a year, but suppose it grows at 7 percent a year. Then the already very large federal deficit will continue to grow, and indeed, to compound : At a 7 percent annual growth rate, our public debt in 2012, estimated at $12.4 trillion, will grow by 40 percent in five years if none of the reforms designed to limit that growth are implemented before the end of that period. Yet if they are implemented while the economy is still struggling, the result may actually be to increase the deficit by driving tax revenues down( because incomes will be depressed) despite the elimination of loopholes, and by increasing transfer payments to the unemployed and others hard hit by the economic crisis. <p> The result is a quandary. I do n't see a way out of it. I hope others do. Richard A. Posner is a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School. <p> Posner acknowledges that the immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the only effective answer to that problem would be stimulus spending, but dismisses that solution saying only that stimulus would come " too late.

And on top of that, we have among the worst obesity rates in the world, a factor that vastly increases the rates of completely preventable and expensive chronic diseases. <p> Education?

In fact, it has recent historical precedent in Japan. But let 's forget that for a second. Take a look at the unemployment rate from 1932 to 1936. Tell me that did n't go down from 23.2% to 16.9%, or a decrease of 6.3%. Then assure me that the New Deal did n't work again. I thought so. We have to reduce unemployment and increase demand so as to get the economy humming. That will help us slow the increase in our debt.

The only reason we do not is political, that our supply-side wackos, beginning with Reagan and, to no surprise, cheered on by such as University of Chicago reactionaries like Posner, have made taxation taboo, although it is essential for a healthy society. <p> We see this at work in Posner 's claim that everyone, regardless of income, should pay some income tax. This is an entirely political claim reflecting Posner 's reactionary ideas of political and economic justice. It has nothing whatever to do with economics, one way or the other, with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least adverse impact on consumption spending, then you levy them on those with surpluses they do not spend, the very people whose national income surplus is the opposite side of the government deficit. That means, the wealthiest, those with the highest incomes, not " everyone, " regardless of income. We need very much more progressive taxation in this country in order to sustain demand as it is the skewness of income distribution -- the very object and result of supply-side insanity -- that has rendered demand fragile and unsustainable. Undoing the depredations of Bush requires not just letting his tax cuts expire, but moving further in the other direction, lowering middle class taxes and increasing them sharply at the highest level. <p> The answer to the Great Recession is sharply higher government spending, until all productive resources in this country are fully employed. There are successful economies with much higher percentages of government spending than ours. We may have to head there, or not. Perhaps once we have returned to full employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to sustain the level of government spending and do n't want to. Or perhaps we will have decided that we prefer more public goods to private. Using what Ronnie Reagan Ultra-Galactic Ouiji Board does Posner conclude that government spending is too late? Given that we are headed to a chronic high rate of unemployment and declining per capita GDP, too late for what? <p> To sharply increased government spending and a much more progressive Federal tax system, add one more element, higher inflation. Do n't soak up all the dollars printed for government spending. Leave more out there to increase inflation to closer to 5%. The inflation will deflate the value of outstanding debt, both government and consumer and facilitate recovery. Consider it a means of recouping some of the Bush high-end tax cuts that we should never have permitted in the first place. <p> The thing that is so objectionable about Posner, today and every day, is that his writings are politics, his right-wing politics, masquerading as economics. <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risk pool and makes it more affordable. " This is crazy. I can not begin to count the ways. <p> As for the Krugman piece that you linked, the chart shows clearly the relationship between unemployment and investment. Since investment, being smaller as GDP share than consumption, can not directly account for higher employment, the investment must be correlated with higher consumption in the ratio of nearly 2:1 consumption to investment. This is a nice back of the envelope demonstration that consumption demand drives investment. The way out is increased demand. The way to increased demand is for the only actor that can autonomously generate demand, the Federal government, to do so. SPEND MONEY! <p> Since investment now is above the curve on the chart, it makes complete nonsense of the claim that Fear of Obama, Uncertainty, Whatever, is depressing investment, the point that Krugman makes.

Number two is tax cuts, spending cuts, and deregulation, which is the proposal of the Republican Party( and most economists who do n't work for a Republican think tank believe it will be disastrous). <p> If anybody has a credible number three, or a clever new way to achieve number one, or at least a reliable way to stave off number two, I 'd love to hear it.

Well, under the Bush Tax Cuts, a married couple can make $86,703 of capital gains and dividends and be at a zero tax.

By reducing direct wages by 10-15%, and reducing benefits by 20-25%, the government is freeing up money for other uses. It provides a cover to industry and acadamia to lower their employment costs. It would cut off a lot of discretionary spending, but most likely would effect the inefficient areas of the economy more than the necessary housing, utilities and base food markets.

While we are at it, we should encourage inflation to deflate the debt and the cash hoard of corporations, encouraging them to spend it before it gets to be worth a lot less. <p> Which is also why Judge Posner is much further from the truth than you might imagine.

Perhaps the reason it would n't be " politically popular " is that the stores and businesses and enterprises in which the affected public sector workers spend their money are n't stupid? Those salaries are the income of those stores and businesses and enterprises, and they know it. <p> That 's right, CRS, the one thing the economy really needs now is even more people with suddenly less disposable income to create demand.

I never would have imagined that evangelicals would obtain any nationally significant numbers yet alone use their belief system to gain political power. <p> But since they have, we should start rethinking the taxation of these churches. They are really making political speech and political policy while at the same time threatening to drive us back to the Middle Ages. <p> Alas this would then apply to all churches, synagogues, temples, mosques but so what.

Much of what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only bad for business it 's bad for everybody.

At the same time, our democracy is being, or is already, hollowed out by the power of money, a simulacrum of democracy. We are becoming a banana republic.

If we can not control costs, then universal coverage will only break the bank faster. My understanding of Obamacare is that that is exactly what it is designed to do, give everyone coverage and threaten to break the bank so quickly that the alternatives are either to eliminate healthcare for vast numbers of people or force us to adopt some type of direct government control of costs. The Swiss have that. I do n't see that Massachusetts does because that is considered verboten in America. Mass my have a similar formal structure, but without the key element, it is not going to rein in costs. <p> Universal coverage is a different issue, ballston.

Am I wrong? And while it is certainly preferable for a stimulus to involve the government itself as both a consumer and an investor, rather than direct payments to consumers, the operative principle is still that money reaches the hands of consumers( by means of their being employed), which in turn stimulates demand. Certainly psychology( confidence, if you will), plays a large role in determining the extent to which consumers save or spend the new income. <p> Hmmm... roid.
