5106841 <p> This includes a major proposed rewording of 3.1.1. Previous wording : 3.1.1 Notification of Alternative Content : Provide a global option for the user to receive cues in the presence of alternatives to rendered content( e.g. visual icons rendered in proximity of content which has short text alternatives, long descriptions, or captions). Proposed new wording : 3.1.1 Identify Presence of Alternative Content : The user has the ability to have indicators rendered along with rendered elements that have alternative content( e.g. visual icons rendered in proximity of content which has short text alternatives, long descriptions, or captions).( Level A)( Also, we are tempted to include the sentence " When the indicator is inserted into content in such a way as to change its dimensions, the user has a global option to specify how layout/reflow of the document should be handled. " but think this will be handled by a separate success criterion.) * Intent of Success Criterion 3.1.1 : When the author provided alternative content, it is wasted if the user can not find it. Thus it becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of alternative content evident to the user. The user should not have to hunt and examine every time to see if it includes such content, as such searching can be time-consuming, especially for users whose disability makes input difficult, tiring, or painful. The user should be able to easily identify which items have alternative content, rather than being merely informed that alternative content is somewhere in the view. * Examples of Success Criterion 3.1.1 : o Distinct visual icons are rendered in proximity of content which has short text alternatives, long descriptions, captions. If the icon forces the text to extend beyond a fixed size container the user agent handles this using its global preference settings to determine whether it expands the container, provides scroll bars, or truncates the content. o When rendering a Web page using synthesized speech, the browser generates an audible tone to signify the word being read is an acronym, and the user can press the * key to hear the expansion. When the phrase being read is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the user can press + to hear the longdesc. o A button is displayed beneath the playing video to indicate that captions are available and to let the user toggle their display. * Related Resources for Success Criterion 3.1.1 : o( Refer to the SC about handling
