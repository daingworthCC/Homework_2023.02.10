5057841 <h> Asia Leaders to Discuss Cooperation, Rights, and Disputes With China <p> Cambodian government security forces walk in front of the Council of Ministers building as they patrol along a street ahead of the 21st ASEAN Summit and other related summits in Phnom Penh, November 13, 2012. <p> BANGKOK -- Leaders in Asia will be gathering in Cambodia later this month( Nov 18-20) for a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Territorial tensions between ASEAN members and China marred a summit in July, adding pressure to the meeting as President Obama is set to make a historic visit. <p> The last regional meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations was considered a disappointment after the group failed, for the first time, to issue a joint statement. <p> Many blamed China, saying it influenced Phnom Penh to block a statement that included concerns by Vietnam and the Philippines over South China Sea territorial disputes. <p> With President Obama expected at the ASEAN East Asia Summit, Ernie Bower, at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, says the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balanced foreign policy. <p> " This balance does n't mean balancing the United States and China, " said Bower. " But it means working with all players and a recognition that ASEAN is very important. I do n't think that recognition came thru in July. So Cambodia has an opportunity - Cambodian leader Hun Sen has an opportunity - in November to make that point. " <p> China has stepped-up aggressive claims to island territory in the South China Sea, raising international concerns including from the United States. <p> ASEAN has been trying to negotiate a code of conduct with China to prevent conflicts. <p> But Beijing prefers to deal with ASEAN members one-on-one rather than as a group. <p> " The setback in July is a serious one because this means that there is more pressure now in November at the East Asia Summit and the sideline meetings to have a code of conduct, " said Thitinan Pongsudhirak is Director of Bangkok 's Institute of Security and International Studies. " So, some drama is in store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that China has some domestic concerns now, they 're going through a leadership transition. It 's not a good time for the Chinese leadership to appear weak. " <p> President Obama is being urged to push ASEAN on human rights concerns. <p> But the bloc is only expected to adopt a watered-down regional declaration of human rights at the summit. <p> Phil Robertson, Deputy Asia Director for Human Rights Watch, says the declaration is a far cry from international standards. <p> " The general principles set out a series of exemptions or loopholes based on local context, based on balancing of rights with responsibilities, based on national security or internal stability, that would limit rights in a way that the international standards do not limit rights, " he said. <p> Robertson says President Obama should also raise Cambodia 's deteriorating human rights
