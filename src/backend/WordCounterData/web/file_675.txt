5094541 <h> share this story <p>( Note : I teach creative writing to undergraduates and am often approached by students who want to know whether they should get an MFA and how they should go about it if they decide to take the plunge. This is my advice.) <p> For proof that the Master of Fine Arts in writing is a degree that has been hotly debated for decades, we need look no further than Iowa Writer 's Workshop alum Flannery O'Connor 's famous remark " Everywhere I go, I 'm asked if I think the universities stifle writers. My opinion is that they do n't stifle enough of them. " After over a decade studying what has been written about the degree, I 've concluded that there will always be those who say that creative writing ca n't or should n't be taught, that the programs are rife with teachers who promote generic McStories and McPoems and who lack an understanding of the publishing world, and that the classes themselves are filled with mawkish students interested only in the therapeutic value of self-expression. It 's simply too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs are often too busy teaching and writing to defend themselves. I do think there 's room for improvement, that 's what my book is about, but I also think that we 're starting to see programs evolve beyond a curriculum that revolves completely around the workshop. In other words, to quote Sam Cooke, " It 's been a long, a long time coming/But I know a change gon na come. " <p> But back to the MFA itself. Here 's what I tell my students : <p> An MFA program can : <p> Give you time and support to focus on your craft and thus accelerate your development as a writer. <p> Provide you with advice and teaching from published writers( and visiting writers) who, if you 've selected your program well, are successful in the kind of writing you want to do. <p> Surround you with peers and teachers and visiting writers who care as passionately about the written word as you do. <p> Ideally, give you contacts in the publishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses and consciously pursue the right opportunities in a program that best fits your interests, help you break into an editorial career in literary publishing, new media or another writing-related career that has n't been invented yet( publishing is changing that quickly). <p> Ideally, if you take the right courses( in pedagogy), publish significantly, or consider further degrees( Ph.D.), help you pursue a job in teaching writing( if that 's what you 're passionate about). <p> An MFA Program Can not : <p> Lead directly to a cushy job teaching creative writing or to a wildly successful publishing career a la Stephen King or Chuck Palahniuk( neither of whom attended one, anyway). <p> If you want to apply : <p> Read widely in contemporary literature( you should, of course, be doing this anyway, as well as reading literature in general). When you find a writer who feels like a kindred spirit, search the web and see if this person is teaching anywhere. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. In its second edition, this is the go-to guide on MFA programs. It will help you to find the right program for you and, even more importantly, help you get the most out of the experience. Tom Kealey runs The MFA Blog. I can not recommend this book strongly enough ; in fact, I recommend it so much Kealey ought to be giving me kickbacks. <p> Also check out the AWP Official Guide to Writing Programs and the Poets and Writers annual special fall issue on MFA programs as well as their helpful online guide. There has been a lot of controversy about the fact that Poets and Writers ranks the programs in a way that many consider dubious : asking prospective students to rank the programs they 're planning to apply to and explain why, which some have compared to asking someone who 's never eaten at a restaurant to evaluate the food based only on the menu. Rankings aside, Poets and Writers provides a great deal of information about the programs themselves, such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so forth. In the quest to find the MFA program for you, information is your best ally. For that reason, check out the data on New Pages as well. <p> Once you have narrowed your choices down to a few programs, thoroughly research the faculty and the programs via their websites. Find out what the faculty have been writing and publishing lately. Read a sample. Consider : Is this someone I want to work with? <p> Try to get a fellowship or an assistantship. Failing that, consider strong state programs with lower tuition. Some will disagree with me on this point, because there are a number of private schools with good programs, a few of which are located in cities with a thriving publishing culture, such as New York and Boston. But if you can avoid it, you do n't want to go too deeply in debt for this degree. <p> Remember : <p> You do not have to get an M.F.A. in order to be a writer. You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting feedback on your writing via an online or face-to-face critique group. You should also consider attending writers ' conferences both regionally and nationally, as well as writing seminars and readings. Do n't rule out the possibility of a low residency M.F.A. program either, especially if you have another career you enjoy but want to continue your writing avocation. <p> Oh yes, did I mention reading? Read. Read some more. Read even more. If you 've begun to despair that you 'll never be able to read everything that you need to read in order to nourish your writing and your soul but that it 's worth a try, then congratulations. You 're on the right track. <p> An argument for MFA programs composed by a MFA instructor fails on myriad levels. Three of six selling points are ideals. Not inconsequentially, two are goals ambitious student writers hope to gain by a MFA. Achievement is self-motivated, with or without the financial and time investments required for a MFA. <p> Most revelatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets '. The ' thats. ' ' An ' qualifying MFA, thus reading an Master 's of Fine Arts? The overall passive construction laden with adjectives and adverbs. A second-person POV does n't convey active persuasion, as advertising industry professionals would attest, and make no mistake, this is a degree-specific advertisement. My editorial experience demonstrates the key area MFA grads must unlearn is the passive voice and construction drummed into them during coursework. <p> There is a reason the majority of publishing writers are not MFAs, and a majority of MFA instructors are not actively publishing, nor have published credentials beyond small press publications, primarily in the how-to-write category. A fiction instructor lacking upper-tier published novels may be at heart a teacher, but one of limited scope and expertise. <p> A student searching for a MFA program must vet and assess the faculty 's bona fide publishing credentials, including publishers. Teachers can inspire, encourage, develop skills and talents. A desired pathway to publication requires road-building experience, as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideals. <p> MrsMissouri : An argument for MFA programs composed by a MFA instructor <p> It is true, Mrs. Missouri, that publication requires road-building experience, which is why I end my letter( which is not an ad but in fact an actual letter, addressed to them) by reminding my students that there are other paths to becoming a writer. The letter itself, including the deliberate use of the word " ideally " more than once, is meant to make them consider thoughtfully and seriously whether this degree is for them. It is also intended to convey their responsibilities in getting the most out of the degree, if they choose to pursue it. Finally, as Mark McGurl demonstrates exhaustively in The Program Era : Postwar Fiction and the Rise of Creative Writing, most of the major American literary figures of the last fifty years are( and have been) MFAs whose work is published by major presses. <h> Loading comments... <p> From The Chicago Manual of Style : " ' A ' or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows an indefinite article, the choice of a or an is determined by the way the abbreviation would be read aloud. " Hence, " an MFA " is correct. Or at the very least, it 's not grammatically incorrect but a matter of the publication 's or writer 's adherence to a particular style guide. And where exactly is all the passive voice in this piece? Adjectives do n't have anything to do with passive voice( a grammatical issue involving subjects and verbs). <p> As for the substance of Stephanie Vanderslice 's post, I hope most educational opportunities include ideals. A high bar that I could n't already meet has been important to my education. Cookie-cutter creative writing programs are not the reality, nor should they be. And I 'm glad this post asserts, in stating some things as ideals, that the field is varied and can continue to get better. <h> Loading comments... <p> cont. take the suggestion seriously. So we can only assume that AWP wishes for current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course they 're likely to know much less about than applicants, having not recently done the necessary research to investigate a broad range of programs ' quantifiable and unquantifiable features. So given that you 've repeated the AWP complaint about the P &W; ranking methodology without noting that AWP 's proposed methodology has never been used in the history of U.S. higher education, or that( if we interpret AWP 's suggestion charitably) it would nevertheless survey a self-interested population with no basis of knowledge of even the most cursory kind -- rather than an unbiased, high-knowledge( i.e. well-researched) population -- I think a clarification is in order. Of course, the reality is that AWP has had an institutional prohibition against ranking its member institutions for nearly a half century now( since 1967), so us even speaking of AWP as being " pro- " any kind of ranking methodology whatsoever is farcical and potentially misleading. Best, --Seth <p> SethAbramson : cont. take the suggestion seriously. So we can only assume <p> You make great points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endorse the restaurant analogy, I was just presenting the other side. Several directors talked about this at AWP, clearly the Poet 's and Writer 's information is filling a need on behalf of students by providing far more information on the programs than has previously been available and I believe that kind of information ABSOLUTELY needs to be available. Also, there is a need for ranking, perhaps not by AWP but by an organization because rankings speak the language of administrators, like it or not. <h> Loading comments... <p> Stephanie, I know you 're not endorsing the analogy AWP has proposed between restaurant consumers and MFA students, but I thought I 'd briefly address it anyway, as you mentioned it. MFA students spend between two and four years of their lives, and in some cases up to $100,000 of their own money, to attend an MFA ; they earn a terminal graduate degree that follows them their entire lives, as do the friendships and mentorships and artistic techniques they cultivate while in-program. If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not just because many of them believe( rightly or wrongly) that their degree will help determine their professional future in some unidentified way, but because they have a tremendous personal, artistic, and financial investment in both their program, its future, and the quality of their " pedigree "( however defined). By contrast, a McDonald 's consumer whisks in and out in five minutes and finishes their French fries in the car. No credible educational ranking system ever devised asks current students of any type of degree program to self-report on their alma maters, because the danger of self-serving survey responses would be staggering, as would the danger of inordinate pressure being placed on students by faculty, administrators, and alumni to beef up the program 's " score " ; that would be unfair to programs, unfair to faculties, unfair to students, and unfair to applicants. And again, this is why no one who coordinates rankings of any kind would ever cont. <p> SethAbramson : Stephanie,
