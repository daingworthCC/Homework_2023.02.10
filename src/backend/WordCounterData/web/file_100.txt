5036541 <h> Bill Maher : If I Had A Son I Hope He Would Act Like Trayvon Martin <p> It 's becoming clearer and clearer that no matter what evidence comes out concerning the Trayvon Martin shooting in Sanford, Florida, America 's media will support him. <p> On HBO 's Real Time Friday, host Bill Maher actually said, " I just want to say if I had a son he would not look like Trayvon Martin, but I hope he would act like him "( video follows with transcript and commentary) : <p> BILL MAHER : There 's lots of new evidence that was made public this week in the Trayvon Martin case. He did have marijuana in his system, a drug that has never made anyone on planet earth violent. And at the moment that he confronted or was confronted by the wannabe cop loser who was stalking him, turns out he probably did beat the dog s -- t out of that guy. I just want to say if I had a son he would not look like Trayvon Martin, but I hope he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns out either a judge or a jury decides George Zimmerman did indeed act in self-defense and Martin was the guilty party? <p> Apparently Maher does n't care about that, for without all the evidence, much like most of the idiots in the media today, he 's decided Zimmerman 's guilty. <p> Exactly how has America " evolved " to a point where folks like Maher have such <p> Noel Sheppard is the Associate Editor of NewsBusters.

Hopefully your son might wan na check to see if the guy is armed before he attempts to beat him into unconsciousness. <p> Wow, even if he did n't get shot, the son Maher hopes for would be spending a lot of time behind bars. Going around assaulting everyone who you feel has looked at you wrong. Maher is pandering like someone above says, no one hopes for a son like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just snapped that one time, but Maher ca n't pretend that it is desireable behavior. <p> In the major sities like DC, NYC. LA, Chicago or Boston he would n't have to worry about if they were carrying. Down south here that should be on the mind of every crook. For some reason they are not smart enough to figure that out. Now that Oklahoma has passed open carry one does not have to wonder. They can see for themselves. <p> The gun grabbers are saying that Oklahoma is going back to wild west. The west was n't really that wild. Books, TV and movies have given it that reputation. There were very few true gunfights but a lot of back shooting. Hell Chicago is worst than any frontier town a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. <p> Edit : " douche bag, scum, POS, lower than whale sh*t, and every other vile name that is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dark alley some night **26;4713;TOOLONG <p> One more Edit : There is a special place in hell for people like him!! I hope Maher can have brunch with Mao, Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, and every other POS, that ever existed on this planet, serves him right!!! ROT IN HELL YOU POS!!!! <p> one last : Karma can be a b*tch Bill!!!! But you 'll get yours in spades!! Reap what you sow clown!! <p> Bill Maher is obviously perverted without restraint. There is no doubt that he is sexually aroused by the concepts of high profile conservative women being sexually degraded in the worst ways, and saying totally out-of-phase with common sense smack like he did in the video. If it were physical, he would be in jail. <p> This is truly malevolent and HBO should consider ripping up his contract. <p> Tonight in Charlotte NASCAR will run its version of an all star event. The winner will receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's for a million dollars " when they beat and bang and wreck one another to take the checked flag. There is no sportmanship in that race. <p> That is the same way Obama thinks. He 'll overlook anything because it is for a million bucks a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. <p> At nearly 6 ' Trayvon could never look like Maher, however by " disrespecting " other people &; not answering Zimmerman as to what he was doing in the " gated community " and then sneaking up on Zimmerman 's backside and physically attacking him... no wait! Maher does n't have the cojones to walk alone at night. Sorry Bill, there is no one as comparatively short in stature, as short in common sense, as short in respectability, as short sighted, as ethically short changed, as morally stumped,... in short you give short people a bad name. Now go run to Robert Reich and ya 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headline, " Race Related Hate Crimes Up, Coincide with Obama Presidency ", seemed to confirm what most people who follow the news already knew, that since the election of Barack Hussein Obama, incidents of blacks attacking whites had increased wildly, maybe exponentially. <p> Not so. <p> First of all, it 's difficult to determine numbers since the MSM rarely notes the race of the alleged criminals, a description that could aid in their apprehension. Secondly, much of the media do n't bother to report black racist crimes at all. <p> In any event, the linked article from ABCNews referred to the reaction of " white supremacist groups " to Obama 's presidency, not to the proliferation of black violence. <p> Indeed, ABC never saw fit to mention that proliferation, instead focusing exclusively on the increase in the number of white militias -- from 150 to 1,274 over three years -- who are incensed over " changes in demographics " and resort to violence, while never citing a single instance of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " what most people who follow the news already knew " should read, " what most people are oblivious of " since the mainstream media, often with the complicity of law enforcement, has long been engaged in a concerted effort to conceal the extent of black hate crimes. <p> There are various reasons for the MSM 's failure to fulfill their fundamental journalistic responsibilities to the public of reporting news objectively and honestly. <p> Some in the media claim they are striving to avoid stirring up dissension, although they had no problem distorting facts related to the George Zimmerman-Trayvon Martin case and causing nationwide upheavals with their proven misrepresentations. <p> Others claim black on white crime is n't inspired by hatred of Caucasians but by poverty and discrimination which, in turn, somehow inspires blacks to attack whites in droves even though worse poverty and discrimination existed years ago and did n't effect the mayhem we see today. <p> What most of the lamestreamers wo n't admit is that they tailor much of the news to benefit Democrats and, especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black people assaulting, robbing, maiming, and murdering white people might awaken Americans to the reality that there is a one-sided race war in progress in America which could negatively impact Obama 's re-election chances. <p> Of course, First Lady Michelle Obama is on record as saying that every negative critique of her husband must incorporate a racist component, an odd opinion in light of Obama 's proclamation of a " post-racial America ", and an opinion that puts a damper on any implied criticism and automatically labels the critic a racist. <p> Lady O 's tactic is a variation on the theory that a great offense trumps any defense. <p> Noted African-American **40;4741;TOOLONG author Thomas Sowell is a keen observer of social trends in the United States. He is also fully cognizant of our race war and often goes on the
