5074641 <h> A Diva 's Star Never Sets, or at Least Not for These Two <p> The term " diva " comes from the Italian for goddess or female deity, and was historically used as a phrase to emulate that of " prima donna. " As the English language has adopted it, the word " diva " refers to female singers whose stardom has exceeded that of just being deemed famous. <p> But more importantly, and relevantly, to this article, the word diva in the Broadway and camp cultures comes along with an obsession with strong, passionate, and over-the-top leading women who appear time and time again in musicals. <p> The list of divas runs long and I can only keep your attention for so little time, so I 'd like to focus on two of my personal favorite divas : Audra McDonald and Sutton Foster. These two dynamic, superbly talented stage( and TV) actresses titillate, inspire, and rope rapturous audiences across the nation into the songs and characters they perform in profoundly different ways. <p> Let 's take Audra McDonald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affectionately call her, studied classical voice at Juilliard before going on to have a fabulous Broadway career. At age 42 she has won 5 Tony Awards( the most in history, along with Lansbury and Harris) in both musicals and straight plays for her performances in Carousel, Ragtime, Master Class, A Raisin in the Sun, and most recently and most famously, for Diane Paulus 's revival of Porgy and Bess. <p> Audra, a classically trained dramatic coloratura, can do ANYTHING. Her drama is always on point, and her voice is smoother than butter as she moves from chest- to mixed- to head-voice effortlessly. To see this woman create art on stage is a gift that the theater has n't experienced in too long a time. From Ragtime to Porgy and Bess, Audra breathes life, energy, and heart into each moment, not letting the smallest detail slip her purview. <p> Now for Ms. Foster. Sutton Foster 's story is one of Broadway legend that has only happened a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of her first musicals in the chorus, the lead actress Kristin Chenoweth( another diva for another time) had to step out to pursue other career opportunities. The director handpicked Ms. Foster from the chorus to fill in for Chenoweth. Can you name the show? <p> This musical was Thoroughly Modern Millie and Foster went on to win the Tony for Best Leading Actress in a Musical in 2001. <p> Since her jump to stardom, Sutton has appeared in five more musicals, four of which garnered her Tony nominations and the most recent of which, Anything Goes won her another Tony. <p> What 's miraculous about Sutton Foster is her attention to precision and her phenomenal belt that is truly unmatched in contemporary Broadway. Her keen eye for comedic moments sets her apart from other leading ladies and enables her to appreciate the slapstick in musicals, and allow the audience to enjoy the comedy along with her. <p> Be on the lookout for more musical theater posts, brought to
