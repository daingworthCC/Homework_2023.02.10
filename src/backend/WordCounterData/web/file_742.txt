5101341 <p> Long story short, I am back on a quad again last time I had one I was about 9. I started on a Eaton Sierra 90, outgrew it, then got a CRF100 and have been on bikes up until yesterday when I traded my 09 CRF230 for a 2002 400EX. I decided to come back to 4 wheels following a few bad crashes on the bike this summer, and my friend who has a 01 400EX that inspired me the most. Just a tough, no bull trail performer. I love the simplicity of air-cooled engines, and how easy they are to work on. He thinks I am a copycat, but truthfully, I just found a damn good deal that I could n't pass up. Anyway, this is what I ended up with. And this is what I traded in... Have n't got to spend much time on it, did the trade yesterday, went for about a 20 minute ride, froze my butt off haha. But love the EX so far and hope to get several years out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i want another sport quad... but not getting rid of the rancher or the rhino to do it.lol. I feel you on the cold. I 'd rather it be 100 degrees outside than be cold. Luckily...
