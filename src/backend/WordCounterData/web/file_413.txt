According to this definition, ART includes all fertility treatments in which both eggs and sperm are handled. In general, ART procedures involve surgically removing eggs from a woman 's ovaries, combining them with sperm in the laboratory, and returning them to the woman 's body or donating them to another woman. They do NOT include treatments in which only sperm are handled( i.e., intrauterine -- or artificial -- insemination) or procedures in which a woman takes medicine only to stimulate egg production without the intention of having eggs retrieved. <p> ART has been used in the United States since 1981 to help women become pregnant, most commonly through the transfer of fertilized human eggs into a woman 's uterus( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this expensive and time-consuming treatment can be difficult.

Although the use of ART is still relatively rare as compared to the potential demand, its use has doubled over the past decade. Today, over 1% of all infants born in the U.S. every year are conceived using ART. <p> *Excludes cycles in which a new treatment procedure was being evaluated. <h> 15 Years of ART Surveillance <p> ART can alleviate the burden of infertility on individuals and families, but it can also present challenges to public health as evidenced by the high rates of multiple delivery, preterm delivery, and low birth-weight delivery experienced with ART. Monitoring the outcomes of technologies that affect reproduction, such as contraception and ART, has become an important public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress the first annual report, titled Assisted Reproductive Technology Success Rates : National Summary and Fertility Clinic Reports. This report gained a wide audience, including potential ART patients and their families, policy makers, researchers and health care providers. Maternal and child health professionals, as well as state and local public health departments, also began requesting data on birth outcomes among infants born using ART technologies in their localities. In 2002, CDC prepared the first ART surveillance report on ART use and outcomes by state. The ART Surveillance Summary is now published as a supplement to CDC 's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report( MMWR).

This information can be obtained by linking ART surveillance data with other surveillance systems and registries, while paying close attention to confidentiality protection. Since 2001, CDC has collaborated with health departments of three states( Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NASS with vital records, hospital discharge data, birth defects registries, cancer registries, and other surveillance systems of these states.
