5026941 <h> Rudy Eugene 's mother : Son was " no zombie, " should have been tased, not shot <p>( CBS) MIAMI, Fla. - The mother of Rudy Eugene, who attacked a homeless man in Miami and chewed his face before being shot and killed by a police officer, says her son was " a nice kid " who could have been subdued with a Taser rather than deadly gunfire, CBS Miami reports. <p> The mother, who asked CBS Miami not to reveal her name, said that was n't her son who she saw on TV - the son who also had two baby brothers, and that " they used to go to church all the time together. " <p> " He was a good kid, " she said. " He gave me a nice card on Mother 's Day. Everyone says he was a zombie. He was no zombie. That was my son. " <p> On Saturday afternoon, the 31-year-old Eugene was killed by a police officer after a reported 18-minute attack on a homeless man, who police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows Eugene coming across Poppo on a sidewalk along Miami 's MacArthur Causeway, stripping clothes off him and eventually chewing on his face. <p> Poppo was in critical condition at a Miami hospital. Police said he lost 75 percent of his face in the attack. <p> But Eugene 's mother told CBS Miami that she never had problems with him, and it was n't necessary for police to shoot him. <p> " They could have tased him, " she said. " I saw what happened on TV and I started crying. " <p> Eugene 's girlfriend, who also requested anonymity from CBS Miami, said the face-eating attacker she saw on TV was nothing like the man she knew and loved. <p> " That was n't him, that was his body but it was n't his spirit. Somebody did this to him, " she said. <p> " He loved God. He always read the Bible. He would give you knowledge on the Bible. Everywhere he went his Bible went. When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Eugene 's girlfriend described him as a " sweet loving gentleman " and a " hard working man " who worked at a car wash and dreamed of owning his own business. She said she has no idea what caused the attack, but she saw no signs of any violence in the nearly five years they lived together. <p> Armando Aguilar, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, told CBS Miami that he suspects Eugene was under the influence of an LSD-like drug called " bath salts. " The drug contains synthetic stimulants that can " cause chest pains, increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, agitation, hallucinations, extreme paranoia, and delusions, " according to the National Institute of Drug Abuse. <p> Sgt. Javier Ortiz, vice president of the Miami Fraternal Order of Police, said officials wo n't know for certain whether drugs played a role in the attack until toxicology reports are completed in a month or so. But he said police have been seeing increased incidents of drug-induced crime in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice, outgoing, ready-to-help-anybody kind of guy, " high school friend Cassandra Metayer told CBS Miami. " Someone in their right mind does n't do that. This is not the act of a normal person. It has to be someone under the influence. " <p> First off stop trying to make rudy the victim because he was not even close to one. No the cops could not tase rudy becasue it would of tased the real victim. An might of killed the victim because he was mostly in shock. Its sad what people will do to try to make someone look like a victim. I would not be surprize if rudy family tries to sue the cops for killing rudy. I do believe more people should of done something then make phone calls. The cops did the right thing and someone should of kill rudy before he ate 5 percent of the guy face if he wasnt going to stop. The really victim will have to leave with what happen to him for ever rudy got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go ahead and establish that " bath salts " refer to things like 4-MMC and MDPV, which are nothing at all similar to LSD. LSD is a psychedelic, not a stimulant. Face-chewing would never occur. <p> " Rudy Eugene 's mother : Son was " no zombie, " should have been tased, not shot " <p> Let 's face it. Eugene was NOT a victim here and even Jackson and Sharpton could n't spin it that way. He was chewing another man 's face off for about 15 minutes. If he did so under the influence of drugs, well life is full of choices. Choosing to put garbage into your system does n't make you a victim either. <p> If a wounding shot failed to deter Eugene, would a taser have been any more effective? This guy was mauling another man to death and gunfire was the most expedient method of stopping a killing in progress. <p> That poor lady... living without the ability to comprehend reality... such a sad position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, especially when a crime is committed. <p> by waverunner1248 June 1, 2012 12:32 PM EDT <p> Damn right he needed to be shot. When a 9mm did n't work, reach for a shotgun. People like this, no matter, white black brown or green, have no business living on this earth at all. They need to go, I 'm glad that
