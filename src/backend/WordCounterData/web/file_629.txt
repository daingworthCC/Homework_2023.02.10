5089841 <h> Locks on the Erie Canal <p> The present Erie Canal rises 566 feet from the Hudson River to Lake Erie through 57 locks. From tide-water level at Troy, the Erie Canal rises through a series of locks in the Mohawk Valley to an elevation of 420 feet above sea-level at the summit level at Rome. Continuing westward, it descends to an elevation of 363 feet above sea-level at the junction with the Oswego Canal, and finally rises to an elevation of 565.6 feet above sea-level at the Niagara River. <p> The original " Clinton 's Ditch " Erie Canal had 83 locks. The Enlarged Erie Canal, built between 1835 and 1862, saw this number reduced to 72 locks. Today, there are 35 numbered locks -- although Lock No. 1 is usually called the Federal Lock -- plus the Federal Black Rock Lock. <h> How a Lock Works <p> In the early days of the canal, when horses and mules walked the towpath, this is how a canal boat passed through a lock : <p> In order to keep pace with the increasing traffic on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and the size of the locks was increased to 110 feet long and 18 feet wide. The enlargement included the doubling of the locks -- two parallel chambers -- enabling traffic to proceed in both directions at the same time. Although the enlargement was declared to be complete in 1862, 15 locks had not been doubled by that time, including most of those west of Port Byron. In 1869, it was decided to resume the doubling, and this was completed in 1875. A number of locks were widened to 20 feet, beginning in 1870. In 1884, it was decided to begin lengthening locks, extending one chamber to double length, allowing passage for " double-headers " -- two boats hooked together -- without the time-consuming necessity for uncoupling. Lengthening of the first lock, Lock 50, to 220 feet was completed in 1885. By 1891, Locks 23-35, 40-43, 45-56, 60-66, and 72 had been lengthened. Locks 1-18( from the Hudson River through Cohoes), 57-59( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were never lengthened. <p> Below are the plans for two of the enlarged, lengthened locks -- click on each image to see a larger version of the plan. <p> Plan of Lock 41, Fort Herkimer, as lengthened in 1891. Note that the eastern( foot) end of the south( berme) lock chamber is noted as " New lock ". <p> Plan of Lock 56, Lyons( also called the Poorhouse lock). Note that in this case, it is the north chamber that has been extended. <p> For a list of Enlarged Erie Canal locks, their location and characteristics, see Table of Locks, edited from : History of the canal system of the State of New York... / by Noble E. Whitford( Albany : Brandow Printing Co., 1906 -- p. 1105-1107). <p> Between 1903 and 1918, the State again enlarged the canal by the construction of what was termed the " Barge Canal ", these locks of today are 328 feet long and 45 feet wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mitre-sills, and can accomodate vessels 300 feet long and 43.5 feet wide.
