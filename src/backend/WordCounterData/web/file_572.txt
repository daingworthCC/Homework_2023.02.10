5084141 <h> New Film : Jesus Was n't Divine &; He Was Born After His Mother Was Raped by a Roman Soldier <p> Last year, a Hollywood documentary wondered if Jesus Christ was a communist. This year, a totally separate film is slated to claim that the Son of Man was born after a Roman soldier raped his mother. The movie, which will be based on Paul Verhoeven 's controversial book, " Jesus of Nazareth, " is set to begin filming in the near future. <p> According to the blog Wizbang, Verhoeven 's 2008 book was filled with some controversial claims. Aside from dismissing Christ 's many Biblical miracles, it charged that Mary 's pregnancy was anything but immaculate and that it resulted from non-consensual sex with a Roman centurion. This, of course, would mean that Jesus was n't( and is n't) the son of God, as stated in Christian tradition. The author also claims that Christ was never betrayed by Judas Iscariot. <p> " As for Verhoeven 's book, the adaptation will depict Jesus in a more human light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being stripped from the story, " IndieWire reported. " Instead, Jesus will be portrayed as an ethicist and a radical prophet, whose message became too politically strong for the Romans to idly accept and endure. While that version may not seem blasphemous to Verhoeven, it more than likely is for many. " <p> Building on the work of the great Biblical scholars of the twentieth century -- Rudolf Bultman, Raymond Brown, Jane Schabert and Robert Funk, founder of the Jesus Seminars, among others -- filmmaker Paul Verhoeven disrobes the mythical Jesus to reveal a man who is, after all, startlingly familiar to us, a man who has much in common with other great political leaders throughout history, human beings who believed that change was coming in their lifetimes. <p> Gone is the Jesus of the miracles, gone the son of God, gone the weaver of arcane parables whose meanings are obscure. In their place Verhoeven gives us his vision of Jesus as a complete man, someone who was changed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, perhaps most importantly, someone who, in his speeches and sayings, introduced a new ethics in which enlightened behavior and the embrace of human contradictions transcend the mechanics of value and worth that had defined the material world before Jesus. <p> Coming to a deeper understanding of the historical Jesus has been a lifelong passion for Verhoeven, who for the last quarter-century has been among the very few nonacademics participating in the Jesus Seminars. Verhoeven assumed that one day he would make a film of the life of Jesus. Then he realized that it must be a book. Steeped in Biblical scholarship but free of the institutional biases, whether academic or religious, that so often dictate the terms of discussion of the historical Jesus, Jesus of Nazareth is a book that builds a bridge reaching all the way back to Jesus 's lifetime, all the way forward to the present, and from biblical scholars to lay readers whose interest might be personal or political. <p> Obviously, the film will offer no shortage of controversy once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to most Christians ' views, he has publicly proclaimed his " passion for Jesus " in past interviews and he has demonstrated a deep interest in trying to better understand the religious figure. <p> " It 's not about miracles, it 's about a new set of ethics, an openness towards the world, which was anathema in a Roman-dominated world, " the author and director told Deadline 's Mike Fleming last year. " I believe he was crucified because they felt that politically, he was a dangerous person whose following was getting bigger and bigger. " <h> Comments( 394) <p> Our thought process seems to run by the way we live and our life style. So we can understand why he can not think any other way. Sad what the morals of this country has fallen to. He knows people love hate movies with sex and violence. More Jesse Jackson 's are learning how to make money by spreading hate for profit. <p> Our Lord certainly does NOT need our Defense, but pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone can call themselves a Director nowadays. The person who posted that this guy directs gay flicks.. I did n't see a notation in article but HAVE no doubt. Good Grief!!! How 'd you like to be this guy? Monday is looking better by comparison!! Forgive us Lord for we do NOT know what we do. <p> I'ts about time someone made a reasonable movie about the MAN they called jesus. Still wo n't see it but glad it will be without all of the fairy tales and hope it will keep children from being brainwashed. That 's if their parents will let them go see it so they think for themselves and make their own judgment as to not just be the sheep that have to believe because they do. <p> Verhoeven was raised by God fearing, Christian parents, but he strayed from the faith. Like so many running from God, he channels his fear of God and depravity into an attack to justify his own moral bankruptcy. Such a sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Verhoeven! Anti-God, anti-Jesus films almost always fail at the box office... People do n't want to waste there time and money to see this kind of crap. <p> After Christ... Christian Sects were established... where some believed that Christ was Conceived as Divine... some that He became Divine... and some that He was a Prophet, with the Holy Spirit, which made Him alike GOD. And, from this comes the Debate : What was the meaning of His death! <p> Any way... in opposition to these Sects, the story presented by Judaism was : Mary, Christ 's mother was Raped by a Roman, or Herod, Soldier.. and she was Impure! <p> He just has a reprobate mind, as the Lord has given him up to Verhoevens ' god-satan. He, sadly, will reap the fruits of his completely idiotic statements. He quotes other so called Great biblical scholars, who like him, also had/have reprobate minds, giving up truth for a lie. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its ' destruction in 70 A.D. was predicted, and it happened! It was also predicted the Jews would be regathered, once again, in the final days, to be a nation once again. Then, the destruction of its ' enemies, and the enemies of GOD wll come to the forefront. God 's WORD is foolishness to those who perish, and 90% of the worlds ' population is about to find this out, sadly! <p> REMEMBER : After 325, Nicaea... where the Roman Emperor Constantine organized the Christian Sects... the only acceptable Theology became... Christ was Conceived as Divine. And, all other Sects were Exiled, alike the Copts! <p> I 'll tell you what you did with Atheists for about 1500 years. You outlawed them from the universities, or any teaching careers, besmirched their reputations, banned or burned their books or their writings of any kind, drove them into exile, humiliated them, seized their properties, arrested them for blasphemy. You dehumanized them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slit their tongues, stretched, crushed, or broke their limbs, tore off their breasts if they were a woman, crushed their scrotums of they were men, imprisoned them, stabbed them, disemboweled them, hung them, burnt them alive. And you have the nerve enough to complain to me that I laugh at you. -- Dr. Madalyn Murray O'Hair <p> In response to LukeRW, all the early Christians... were Jewish. Early Jewish thought believed wholeheartly in a suffering Messiah who would preform miracles and die on behalf his people. It was only several hundred years later, when Christianity denied it 's Jewishness and oppressed it 's root, that Jewish faith changed its qualification for Messiah. As to the whole idea that Mary was raped by a Roman officer? Ludicrous. In the small-town community culture of Galilee and Israel. There was absolutely no way a origin story like that could have been kept quiet- and not a chance in the world Jesus could have gained the political and religious prominence he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own purposes. <p> I am Jonah in regards to atheists or people who want to make a living on defaming Jesus. I know God is a forgiving and loving God showing kindness to those who do n't deserve it. I do n't need a whale to vomit me up so I simply say God break them and make them yours. That would be cool. Athiests and blasphemers there is a day of righteous judgement coming. Repent because God does not want to destroy you and because I am in His debt I beg of you to reconsider. Or, that God puts such awful conditions before you life that you 've no where to go but to Him. <p> Amen. P.S. Mormonism is not Christianity. Glenn you better know the difference because it matters. <p> Ho hum... yet another warming over of the Pharisaic claim about the Lord Jesus Christ. This b.s. has been claimed for nearly 2000 years and for some reason it just does n't sem to be able to make the Lord go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the dead, yet will they not believe ". Looks like this bozo is to be counted in that number. I predict his film will receive " wild acclaim " for its " stellar accuracy, superb acting, yadayadayada... " but it will fall financially faster than a millstone tied about this chump 's neck as he is cast into the sea. <p> The bible was written for political interest, by Greeks, in Greek.( A language Jesus did n't speak) You can thank Emperor Constantine for compiling the first publication of the Holy Bible. Need I remind you it was the first time a government used a religion to unite it 's people. Boy did it work. <p> Before any of you start your bashing and scripture quoting, I have a firm belief in god, just not in Christianity, and I hold nothing against Christians for their faith. <p> The Road to HELL is WIDE........ after a taste of life in this MANS/SATANS world, I can not understand how so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The Choice is YOURS people. A short life in this stupid world or forever in Heaven. I chose Heaven! See ya, Do n't want to be ya, all you atheists are dumber than dumb. I will however, pray for you all! <p> Shall we talk about what the state philosophy of the USSR and all other Communist governments, atheism, did to destroy human freedom in the last century after the Russian Revolution of 1917? The atheist Soviet state killed tens of millions of people who dared question atheistic Communism, it also persecuted religion and killed hundreds of thousands of priests, ministers, nuns, and even rabbis and mullahs and created a one party state where no opposing points of view of any kind were allowed to exist. The Atheist Communist governments in the USSR, China, Viet Nam, Cambodia, North Korea and others created vast networks of labor death camps where tens of millions died. The first Communist atheist death camps were in Stalin 's Gulag years before Hiler 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famines in the Ukraine that killed at least 7 million in a forced famine in the early 1930? s. Atheist states banned and burned books, and allowed no freedom of speech. Atheist Communist states thought of people as mere atoms for the state to do with as it pleased with no civil rights. The list of atheist state abuse in the last century goes on and on. This all happened within the last 100 years by Marxist Communist systems that many liberals not long ago supported. Did you? Modern state atheism has it 's own bloody history. By the way, Madalyn Murray O'Hair was never a " Dr " of anykind. She did go to law school but never passed her bar exams. <p> @CESIUM WOW! An atheist, a Jew, AND a graduate student. Who would dare go up against YOU? Triple threat! You do have posters shaking in their boots. How ' bout assigning more labels to yourself? I 'm sure there are many here with suggestions. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you read Josephus, Tacitus, Pliny the Younger, Phlegon, Lucian, Celsus, Suetonius and Thallus, as well as the Mara Bar-Serapion -- all non-Christian historians who wrote about Christ? &,; in addition to the evangelists &; those who wrote the New Testament, have you read Linus, Iranaeus, Clement of Rome &; the many, many other 1st century witnesses who left us written testimonies about Christ? we have more evidence about Jesus collected immediately after &; w/i a few years of Christ 's death than any other figure in ancient history. we have more about Him than about many figures of more modern history. but you do n't like the history they tell so you decide it 's " unreasonable. " these " great Biblical scholars " are n't comfortable w/ the truth. they too decided everyone was lying, that no one got it right so they rewrote history w/o a shred of evidence to support them. Verhoeven took their work &; wrote a book for the avg man( the " scholars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read them) &; is now making a film to reach those who did n't read his book but will see " important " films. you may decide you do n't believe them just as you may decide there was no moon landing. but to imagine that Verhoeven, who rejects the witnesses accounts( that support what the Church has taught for 20000 years), is making a " reasonable " movie is utterly unreasonable. <p> @Mils, there are facts! facts! read Scripture &; the early Church Fathers. read Josephus, Tacitus &; the other 1st century Roman historians. Christianity has n't been hidden, it 's out in the open for those who care to see it. <p> @LukeRW : Jesus divinity was taught by His disciples. some NT references( not in historical order but all 1st century) : answered him, " Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life ; and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you, and killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. Phil 2:5-7Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. Col 2:8-9See to it that no one makes a prey of you by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the universe, and not according to Christ. For in him the whole fulness of deity dwells bodily, <p> there are other sources. Christ 's divinity was made a dogma of the Church in 325 a.d. but only after it had been taught from the beginning. that 's a mistake many make about Catholic dogma thinking old, white men in Rome pass edicts. actually, they do n't proclaim dogma unless &; until some part of the faith has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The movie and book are just more recycled gibberish based on a century-old approach that violates every rule of textual analysis and interpretation. If the Bible were n't its target, it would be laughed out of court. <p> Where this silly approach goes wrong is that it turns rules of evidence upside down. Outside of the wacky little world of biblical criticism, scholars assume that texts are conveying accurate information until proven otherwise. If a text speaks about people, places, and things, we give the writer the benefit of the doubt on the details until either he contradicts himself in a big way or something outside the text contradicts him and his words. <p> Nearly all of the Jesus Seminar material violates this common-sense approach to old texts. <p> So let me get this straight, he was able to show that Jesus was born out of rape how? It is funny that he can conclude that something that occured 2000 years ago, and has very little written about it other that what is contained in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was able to discover something about probably the most studied figure in human history that no one else has been able to prove over the course of close to 2000 years. Man, that must be amazing being as smart as he must be!( please note the sarcasm) <p> Reportedly.. Paul Verhoeven is a member of the Jesus Seminar being the only member who does not have a degree in biblical studies. He graduated with a degree in mathematics and physics from the University of Leiden. Since he is not a professional biblical exegete, his membership in the Jesus Seminar has been cited as a sign that this group is less scholarly than it claims So I would assume that this guy is just in it for the money that he will make from the controversy.. he really has no clue.. <p> Amazing that this " rape-victim " Jesus singlehandedly changed the course of religion and world history and never so much as wrote a letter. Amazing that a Jew( Thomas) would call this " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @.( John 20:28). Amazing that the immediate followers of this " rape-victim " Jesus would ALL die horrible torture-filled deaths claiming that He was the resurrected Messiah and Son of God. Amazing that thousands would continue to die throught history making the identical claim. <p> These idiots have to completely disregard everything Jesus claimed about himself, and everything others claimed about him as well. <p> And yes, the cowards and children of Satan must ALWAYS be driven to attack Jesus Christ( and NOT Muhammed, Buddha, Krishna, etc.) because Jesus is the only man who backed up his claims with actions and spotless character. <p> The detailed prophecies that were fulfilled by Jesus are amazing not to mention all of the Typology of Christ and His work of redemption literal on every page of the OT ; I can not fathom how people so quickly and easily dismiss Him as Messiah? Having said that I also know that many have had their minds blinded, their thinking twisted, and their eyes remain closed. What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have become as a nation. Greed, immorality, ruthlessness, and vanity are all increasing at very distrubing rates. Claiming to be wise we have become a nation of fools and the fruit is ripening on the tree as we speak. God will not be mocked, we will reap what we have and are sowing as a nation. As the foundations crumble, what are the righteous to do? Men need to lead their homes and invest in their children, the courageous need to stand up and speak out against evil. Just ask the German christians who were silent when Hitler rose to power what can come from passivity and silence. All evil needs to succeed is for good men to do nothing. <p> " Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace.

They are trying to destroy God. Without God, there can be no inalienable rights, endowed by our creator. Then they can say rights are given by man, meaning they can be given or removed by government. Look at all the politicians on the left now saying that healthcare is a right, employment is a right, having your own home is a right. This not only shows what Obama has been striving for, it is also almost directly from the Communist Manifesto. <p> It is also interesting to note that nobody is making a movie to discredit Muhammad. No doubt because when Muslims are offended, they start chopping heads. The Bible says that Christians would be persecuted in the end times. I will die praising God to my last breath and no politician, terrorist, or thug shall sway me. <p> @ALESSANDRE Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you read the scripture word for word over and over again as if it is supposed to mean something like take it literally does not make it true. 20,000 years??? I thought you creationists thought the earth was only 10,000 years old? Just more useless jibberjabber from the crazy jesus freaks. Wake up and smell the 21st century! Oh, and yes I do believe in the moon landing as it happened in my lifetime but your god and jesus had nothing to do with it. When they find heaven let me know LOL. <p> As far as I know, he only made exactly one movie with a bisexual lead character, The Fourth Man. He also made Starship Troopers, but I do n't assume that his sympathies lie either with military dictatorships, or with giant bugs from outer space. <p> These tales all sound interesting. Unfortuneately there is extremely little evidence of Christ as an actual person. They build these tales on very little knowledge, usually second or third hand a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds that would really mean anything, anything but a felection of the authors biases. <p> Actually, they have found ancient texts written by prominent Jews of the day, who wrote about the Man Jesus. They even spoke of the ' miracles ' written in the New Testament. However, those prominent Jews also believed the miracles to be works of the devil... <p> How about the " Dead Sea Scrolls "? How about the church in Bethlehem you can enter and go down to the lower levels where the cave became the birth location of Jesus. You say fake and I say historical truth. Hopefully Jews and Christians alike will reject this movie and save their dollars for worthy films. <p> Since you seem to believe that there is no evidence for Christ I will provide some extra Bibical evidence.

They reported that he had appeared to them three days after his crucifixion and that he was alive ; accordingly, he was perhaps the messiah concerning whom the prophets have recounted wonders. "( Arabic translation) <p> Now, I 'm beginning to see the light!

Everything cited is just what I sdaid, references to Christ by second hand sources. I am aware of everything above. Where is the item used by Christ? Where is the definite connection? It does nt exist. Idiots that think I do nt believe in Christ, its faith stupid. I have faith.. <p> None of this garbage is new ; as for these alleged scholars they are Satan 's servants and serve him with great enthusiasm ; academia and the media work hand in hand in this effort. What we are witnessing is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our society and culture. The arrogance of atheism and those who are part of it think of themselves as gods in their own right and create their own " ethical code ", read moral here. When in fact it only reveals the total depravity of mans mind, character and behavior. In joining Satan and promoting his deceptions and denying TRUTH in his long war against the Sovereign Holy Creator God, they seal their eternal destination. <p> " Building on the work of the great Biblical scholars of the twentieth century..... " ha ha ha ha ha. Did you type this with a striaght face? Funny how " Bible scholars " never seem to believe the Bible. Apparently, being a scholar means you know squat and make stuff up! <p> This coming from the genius that brought us " Showgirls " and " Robocop "? Arguably the two worst movies ever created? Showgirls was so awful that it ruined any actiing cred the main star had from " Saved by the Bell ", now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of RoboCop says the fact that I base my whole life on is wrong. I might have to rethink this whole christianity thing. After all, he did make RoboCop. ha ha ha ha..... <p> True. I also notice that the many atheists who post here can throw out scripture like Lucifer but they have no understanding of the Bible either. Unlike Lucifer, who also can recite the Bible chapter and verse, they do not believe the Word of God. Lucifer on the other hand knows that God exists. <p> The interting thing is that when people like this do things like this they actually help support the biblical doctrines that Jesus taught when he said the world hates him because he convicts them that what they do is evil. Also, that the carnal man can not submit to God. Spirit gives birth to spirit. They actually unknowingly fulfill what is written just like Caiaphas did when he, an unbelieveing Pharisee, prophesied that a man would die for the people.... God 's foolishness is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order for Satan( lucifer was his name before falling) to twist scripture and pervert it 's meaning to mislead humanity he must know exactly what it says. He did in fact quote it accurately to Jesus in the wilderness. He simply misapplied them by taking them out of their proper context. I think the point mom was trying to make is obvious to most objective readers. <p> Some people you just ca n't reach! Their egos and so-called intellect will not allow them to accept Christ so they spend their entire lives trying to debunk Him. Go ahead Buddy. I 'm sure you 'll receive an Academy Award by your atheist pals in Tinsletown but is it worth your soul? Better do some thinking on it! <p> Hey, Glenn- here is the first appendix to your book " Cowards " : Fim makers who make anti-Jesus movies. The Prince of Peace, is an easy target. His followers are mostly asleep, so they will probably only write tepid letters and boycott theaters. If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make movies like this about Mohammed. <p> I 'm sure this guy will get his chance in front of Christ to explain this as we all will have that chance. I know Christ has forgiven this guy already and loves him but I 'm sure Jesus at times scratches his head in amazement at these things. <p> Christ does not give forgivness unless it is asked for. This whole thing would be totally laughable if it was not so pathetic! Mr Verhoeven you WILL meet your maker and have to explain yourself, Better get ready! And that goes for all the other athiest cowards on the Blaze! <p> Please be careful Newlife. There is a hell. God has spoken on this subject many times and tells us what it is like. When you say that you know God has already forgiven him, you imply that everyone is forgiven. If your church is teaching this soft, everybody goes to heaven because God loves everybody theology, find another church fast. <p> No, it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of or even cared who Jesus was until the week they crucified Him is ridiculous and based on nothing. They were not interested in the internal affairs of the jews. As long as they maintained order and taxes. This is PLENTY of historical evidence to substanciate the Bible. This has zero. <p> While I as a Jew do n't believe Jesus was either the Messiah or divine, I do n't think this story is historical. Personally, I believe Jesus was handed over to the Romans by the Sadducees, a sect of Jews that rejected all oral traditions and embraced Roman traditions. Nearly all of the Priests serving in the Temple, including the Roman appointed High Priest, were Sadducees. The Temple was the main source of their authority and Jesus challenged that, which is why the Christian texts record the High Priest at Jesus ' trial. They had him executed in order to ensure their own authority was n't threatened. <p> Instead of condeming vanderhooven and the athiests who post here, we shoul pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, i know you do n't know me, but you 'll have to take my word for it. i was very bitter at god, and when i came to him, he COMPLETLY changed my life! i mean a complete 180. all i know it was'nt me it was Jesus. <p> The only possible source I can think of for his notion is one I saw mentioned years ago from an old Jewish source( not even sure what) claiming Josh of Nazareth was the son on a Roman soldier named " Panther " &; got himself some tiny bunch of disciples before being executed.
