5090941 <h> Brokerage Partners <h> Members question proposed YMCA merger <p> LIMERICK - A proposed merger of a local YMCA organization with one in Philadelphia had dozens of Spring Valley YMCA members and employees up in arms with organization leaders Monday. <p> About 150 members and employees attended a meeting Monday at Spring Valley YMCA. The meeting, which was conducted by Sandy Lipstein, chairman of the board of Freedom Valley YMCA, was intended to field members ' questions about a proposed merger of Freedom Valley YMCA and the YMCA of Philadelphia &; Vicinity. <p> By way of kicking off the meeting Lipstein told the crowd gathered in two combined gymnasiums at the popular YMCA, " You have my apologies for underestimating how you feel about this merger. I take responsibility for that. The merger between Phoenixville and Pottstown a few years ago did n't generate as much concern. " <p> Lipstein is slated to become board chairman of the merged organization, which is to be named Philadelphia Freedom Valley YMCA, pending majority membership approval. Should members of Freedom Valley YMCA - those from Upper Perkiomen, Pottstown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of the merger on Nov. 15, the two YMCA organizations will become one, effective January 1. <p> Also present at the meeting and available to answer questions were John F. Flynn, president CEO of the 10-branch YMCA of Philadelphia &; Vicinity, who is set to become CEO of the merged organization, and Jay Schaeffer, current president and CEO of Freedom Valley YMCA. <p> Not everyone is in favor of the proposed merger, and that was apparent at the meeting. <p> Several members of Spring Valley YMCA stated that they were not given enough information about the proposed merger ahead of time, and that the voting process seems unfair and unwarranted. Many expressed fears that their YMCA branch - and especially its extremely popular outdoor pools - will be overrun by Philadelphia members as a result of the merger. <p> Jack Hennessey, a charter member of Spring Valley YMCA, said the vote, which is set to be held at Chadwick 's Restaurant in Audubon on Thursday at 7 p.m. is not being conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lipstein why voting could not be done by ballot or mail as Section 2.2 of the Freedom Valley YMCA bylaws states. <p> " The board does have the option of altering the mechanism for the vote, " Hennessey said. <p> Lipstein said Pennsylvania law for nonprofit organizations requires that members must be present to vote. He said the vote will go ahead as planned. <p> Hennessey noted that YMCA employees who are scheduled to work next Thursday will not be able to vote. Lipstein said possibly those employees could be allowed to vote using a substitute. <p> Hennessey said he also has a concern about how votes will be verified, and whether those voting will be actual members of the Freedom Valley YMCA. Other YMCA members in attendance said they also do not trust the vote wo n't be " rigged. " Lipstein noted that members will be asked to sign in using their name and address, and that information will be verified following the vote if necessary. <p> Lipstein noted that there has been a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the merger will not increase the population of the outdoor pools at Spring Valley Y in the summer as " there will be no reciprocity( between branches) for outdoor pools. " Additionally, fitness programs at Spring Valley wo n't be crowded out by Philadelphia Y members due to a similar lack of reciprocity. <p> The merger will not " create a massive influx in the Wellness Center exercise room, " although members of branches will be able to use other branches, Lipstein said. Rates and the way rates are set will not change with the merger, he said. And, Freedom Valley YMCA CEO Jay Schaeffer, who is set to retire pending the merger, will not receive a " golden parachute " of any kind because of it, as has been rumored, Lipstein said. <p> One member of the audience asked, " If we do n't like( the merged organization), will there be a refund of membership? " <p> After some discussion with Lipstein and Flynn, Schaeffer agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a merger. <p> Lipstein added, " We 're not looking to create a building full of people who do n't want to be here. " <p> One benefit of the merger, according to Lipstein, is it will result in a $150,000 annual cost savings to employees who get health insurance through Freedom Valley YMCA. That will affect 10 percent of employees, he said. Additionally, Freedom Valley employees who participate in the organization 's retirement plan will benefit from the more generous YMCA of Philadelphia &; Vicinity plan. <p> The Philadelphia Freedom YMCA will be one of the largest YMCA organizations in the country, giving it greater influence when it comes to policymaking and enable " top notch " personnel hires, according to Lipstein. <p> Freedom Valley will also benefit from the Philadelphia organization 's information technology and human resources departments. " We have outsourced a lot of that, and we will no longer do that, " Lipstein said. <p> Susan Criss, a fitness instructor who began working at the Phoenixville YMCA 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said what bothers her more than the possibility of a merger is the way information has been presented. <p> " I 'm not happy with the way its been handled - how quickly they seem to want to push it through, " she said. <p> Criss, as well as many others at the meeting, had objections to the voting procedure. <p> " Why do we have to vote so quickly? Why not ballot vote at each facility? Why do we have to vote at Chadwick 's restaurant? " Criss asked. " There 's a great concern about this vote. Why not make it just like the presidential election and let it go on( at all the locations) for an entire day? " <p> Criss said she thought those conducting the meeting were very disrespectful to YMCA members and employees in the audience who were seeking answers. <p> " It frustrates me that they want us to trust them but they do n't want to listen to our concerns, " she said. <p> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no " speech making " from members of the audience, and would entertain questions only. <p> Ultimately, Criss said she agreed most of the fears other members and employees have voiced to her are " probably irrational. But they need to be acknowledged, and I think that 's what 's missing here. Certain questions were not answered directly. " <p> Mike M., a Limerick resident who asked that his last name not be publicized, said he does plan to travel to Audubon to vote next week. Mike said he has had a family membership at the Spring Valley YMCA for about seven years. <p> " I can see why everybody 's concerned about the influx of people coming to this facility here, " he said. <p> He mentioned that not all of his questions were answered at Monday 's meeting. <p> " I guess what everybody 's fear is - and what my fear is - is that membership fees will go up. They did n't say a lot about the benefits for the members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " But after hearing what they had to say in the meeting, I feel that definitely it 's going to benefit all the members and add more benefits, such as taking care of maintenance issues at the facility. So why not vote for the merger? " <p> Rosemary Baues, 68, who has been a Freedom Valley YMCA member for more than three years and enjoys a number of classes there, said she felt Lipstein, Flynn and Schaeffer were " being extremely condescending " to those in the audience at Monday 's meeting. <p> " I expect them to put up a good show of why I should vote for the YMCA merger, " Baues said. <p> Asked if she would be present at next Thursday 's vote, Baues said " Oh my God, yes! And I 'm picking up a bunch of people who ca n't see to drive at night to go as well. " <p> Baues said she would have liked to see voting made possible at each separate facility, or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chadwick 's location was selected because it was central to the five Freedom Valley YMCA branches - about a 10-minute drive from Phoenixville, Spring Valley or Audubon ; 20 minutes from Pottstown and a little farther for the members of the Upper Perkiomen branch. <p> Elias " Lou " Varvarezis of Schwenksville, a Spring Valley YMCA member, was outspoken against the merger at Monday 's meeting. <p> " My only issue with this is there was no information of detail provided - through all the mediums they have - for the people voting, " Varvarezis said. " And not postponing the vote until that information is provided is what bothers me. " <p> Several people at the meeting voiced concerns about Philadelphia Y members coming to use the gym and " sneaking into the pool " in the summertime. Lipstein answered, " Philadelphia is an hour away from here. People could go to the shore faster( than come here). " <p> Flynn added that the policy of non-reciprocity on the use of the outdoor pools will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked if Freedom Valley YMCA will " have a responsibility to support Philadelphia if they get into( financial) trouble? " <p> Lipstein answered, " If this merger is approved, it 's not us ' and them '. It 's all us. It 's all one. " <p> For the merger to be approved, a majority of both the Freedom Valley YMCA and YMCA of Philadelphia &; Vicinity membership must vote for it. <p> " The merger is a merger of equals, " Lipstein said. " Both sides have to agree by a majority of votes. " <p> More information about the merger is
