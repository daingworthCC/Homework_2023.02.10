5258841 <h> How To Appraise A Car That Has Been In An Accident? <p> Some of you may know that i got into an accident two months after i got my MS3, and i really havent been happy with the car since then. <p> The damage was mainly to the left front corner. No frame damage, no airbag deployment. <p> Total cost to fix with paint and labor was just over 7k. <p> Ive looked at some cars on cars.com, and when i pull up the carfax and it shows an accident, the car is only priced 200 or so below retail. <p> So i was just curious on what is taken into account when setting the price on a used, wrecked car. <p> I may be in the new car market soon, so i figured i may get more if i sell privately. <p> vas25tl 2012-05-01 17:28:10 +0000 #2 <p> I think it 's different for every person since there is not real logic/book to appraise a car that has been in an accident but has a clear title. <p> I look at how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off accordingly. 9 times out of 10 though if I see a dirty carfax, I move on to the next vehicle. <p> crazyasiantl 2012-05-01 17:57:26 +0000 #3 <p> The shop repainted the whole front end, and the whole left side, just have a good match/blend. so almost half of the car was resprayed <p> JS + MS3 2012-05-01 17:36:33 +0000 #4 <p> Sell it couple thousands below the KBB market value? <p> or just sell it to a dumbass on craiglist @ the market value? <p> Did you not get any money out of that accident from the insurance for this? I ca n't remember. <p> And you should go to Carmax to get it appraised to start off. <p> or post a thread over at mazdaspeedforums.org. Explain the situation. Make it a fair deal and sell it to the member? <p> AZuser 2012-05-01 18:39:24 +0000 #5 <p> You have n't really been happy with the car because they did n't fix it correctly or some other reason, which is? <p> If I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car as it is now based on mileage and overall condition, but for one that 's never been in an accident. <p> I 'd then adjust the price based on : <p> - what type of accident it was involved in and how severe <p> - the quality of the repair and whether OEM parts were used or not <p> - who did the repairs( experienced/well known body shop with a good reputation, unknown body shop around the corner, DIY, etc.) <p> - photos/documentation of damage and repairs( before and after photos, bill showing what parts were replaced and used, etc.) <p> Personally, I 'd expect at least $1,800-$2,000 less than a non-accident MS3 assuming OEM parts were used, it was a quality repair done by an experienced/quality shop, you had pics/documentation of before and after, no air bags deployed, no structural damage, etc. I 'd want a bigger discount if any of the above could n't be shown or determined. <p> But like vas25tl said, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I 'd look at things if I was considering a car that 's been in an accident, though I generally avoid cars that have been in accident(s). <p> crazyasiantl 2012-05-01 19:01:08 +0000 #6 <p> The car was fixed perfectly by a professional, just knowing that the car has been in an accident kinda spoiled the fun for me. <p> I do have everything documented and saved every piece of paperwork from the body shop and insurance <p> And Aaron, did n't get anything from the accident. Just a headache and a fixed car <p> This was my first and hopefully only accident. But ill be better prepared to fight it next time if this whole insurance fiasco happens again. <p> AZuser 2012-05-01 18:40:43 +0000 #7 <p> Too late now, but in the future, try to get some sort of compensation for depreciated value if you 're ever in an accident, the other party is at fault, and the car is of significant value( i.e. the car is n't a beater). <p> Even if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be worth less than a non-accident car. Compensating you for depreciated value will help offset that loss if you ever sell. <p> JS + MS3 2012-05-01 20:40:12 +0000 #8 <p> What 's the market value of
