5103741 <p> Just thought I would throw this out there, made my first all grain that was n't a BIAB style and I really was n't sure if I was going to like it so I did n't want to buy a new cooler and modify it to see, so I went to the craft store and bought a yard and a half of nylon, they called it tulle. I put it down in the cooler and put 11 pounds of grain in it and tied it up loosely so that it that it was not packed tight at all. I hit my starting and original gravity that my recipe was set at with figuring 70% efficiency, I just set the cooler up on the counter and drained the wort out into my pot like normal, ran some back through, then did a batch sparge, so just an idea if you want to try all grain without spending on the cooler, and I did enjoy all grain, so now Ill buy a cooler and modify myself. <p> The only issue for me is my cooler does n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since its warm) the wort then gently pouring it through the grain again be useful for removing coudiness/sparging some more sugar? <p> Or should I just accept I would get a perfectly crystal clear and efficient mash if I 'm not going to invest in equipment? : P <p> Do you want crystal clear wort or would you be satisfied with crystal clear beer? My wort comes out cloudy as h*** because I BIAB and I SQUEEZE the bag to get all the wort out that I can. My beers still turn out clear. <p> Do you want crystal clear wort or would you be satisfied with crystal clear beer?
