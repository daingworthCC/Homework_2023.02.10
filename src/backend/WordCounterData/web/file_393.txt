5066141 <p> MINNEAPOLIS( WCCO) -- Unsettling statistics involving unlicensed drivers have been released by the Minnesota State Patrol. The release comes in the wake of two deadly crashes involving drivers with revoked licenses. <p> " When you look at a crash involving an unlicensed driver often times the first reaction is this person should n't have been here in the first place, " said Lt. Eric Roeske with Minnesota State Patrol. <p> The first incident happened Saturday night when a driver hit and killed an Augsburg College student near the Warehouse District in downtown Minneapolis. <p> On Tuesday, Hennepin County prosecutors charged Teisha Yovonne Randle, 27, with two felony counts of criminal vehicular homicide in the death of Austin Conley, 20. <p> Randle told police she heard a loud crash and that her windshield " exploded, " a criminal complaint says. She said she thought someone threw a rock at her car and so kept driving. It was later learned that Randle had her license revoked. <p> State Patrol says a car driven by Isidoro Burgos-Corona, 49, of Minneapolis, was stalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when three cars crashed into him from behind. A cab involved in the crash was rear-ended and pushed into the middle of the interstate, where he was hit by a semi-truck, killing him. <p> Corona was arrested for driving without a license. State records show Corona was charged several times in the past for driving without a license, driving after revocation and driving without insurance. <p> " Unlicensed drivers are twice as likely to be involved in a deadly crash as a licensed driver, statistically, " Roeske said. <p> In 2011, 3,467 drivers did not have a valid driver license and were involved in crashes, 31 of those crashes were deadly. That 's.89 percent. <p> In 2011, 98,987 drivers involved in crashes had valid licenses and 430 of them were deadly. That 's only.43 percent. <p> State patrol says that means " not valid " drivers are 2.1 times more likely to be involved in a deadly crash than valid drivers. <p> " From my point of view, if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're behind a wheel, obviously, they 're not cognizant of following the law, " Roeske said. " And that may lead them to break others laws while behind the wheel. " <p>... Unsettling statistics involving unlicensed drivers have been released by the Minnesota State Patrol.
