5031241 <p> TV audiences ' watching habits have changed so dramatically due to digital video recording that if the DVR were a network, its ratings would beat the traditional networks among total viewers and in the critical young-adult demographic, according to TV Guide. <p> DVR usage is up 30 percent compared to last year, which is impacting TV ratings, which were initially seen as dismal this fall. Many shows previously believed to have failed are more likely to survive if it is discovered that they have a larger audience, which simply chooses to watch on a different schedule, according to the report. <p> " Our shows are really popular, and to think they suddenly lost their popularity seemed hard to believe, " said CBS senior executive vice president Kelly Kahl. " We started getting the delayed numbers and it made more sense. " <p> Time-shifted viewing is changing the way that network executives judge their line-ups, Kahl says, pointing out that knee-jerk reactions to early ratings are no longer reliable. <p> The DVR has proved to be a mixed blessing for the TV industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more TV and offers executives an additional measurement to determine if a show is a hit, as opposed to just the overnight numbers.
