Experts chose the top 12 short stories and ranked the four long tales. My Baker Street Journal article provides a detailed analysis and the following results : <h> Choosing Your First Holmes Book <p> Although the Holmes series began with a novel, you should start by reading The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. It includes the first Holmes short stories and 5 of the top 12 overall. To read The Adventures, see the best hardback and the best paperback edition. <p> Points : A 12-point weighting model was used to determine the best short stories. <p> " Ratings " for individual stories were computed by dividing each score by the maximum score for that category and multiplying by 100. This provides a simple value for comparing the relative positions of stories within a category. <p> " Ratings " for the collected tales were based on the average score of all the stories in a volume and indexed for a top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often included in His Last Bow, it was counted as part of the Memoirs because of its original publication date. <p> Rank for collected volumes denotes which ranked stories in the Top 12 appear in that collection. <p> In 1927, The Strand Magazine held a Sherlock Holmes Competition in which it challenged its readers to list the twelve best Holmes stories as selected by Conan Doyle. None of the stories from The Case-Book were eligible since it had not yet been published in book form. Sir Arthur later gave his choices in " How I Made My List " in the June 1927 issue of The Strand Magazine. <h> More Information <p> This page also provides supplementary " story rating " information below for a four-part series of articles by me that appeared in the December 1999 Baker Street Journal.

However, those reports raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted. My article " Irregular Participation " clears up some mysteries surrounding these prior polls. <h> " Rating Sherlock Holmes " Supplement <p> Since the prior polls all had certain limitations, I sent a proposal to Don Pollock, Editor of the BSJ, to carry out a new and more reliable poll of Sherlockian experts. The 1999 poll of Baker Street Journal readers was the largest and most comprehensive survey ever conducted. My article " Rating Sherlock Holmes " describes and analyzes the 1999 poll results, including rankings for the short stories, the long stories, and the collected tales. <p> The 1999 poll used a 12-point weighting method to rank the short stories. Since the number of first-place votes provides additional critical insight, this information also appears in the table of results. There are, however, many other potential weighting models and some were mentioned in the article. <h> " A Study in Sherlockians " Supplement <p> I had never seen any demographic information on Sherlockians and thought that the 1999 poll offered a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also wanted to see if a voter 's experience or affiliations would relate to their choice of the best stories. My article " A Study in Sherlockians " covers both of these topics for the first time. <p> Because of the large number of participants in the 1999 poll, it was worthwhile to compare the choices of various groups of voters. The December 1999 BSJ article listed only the top choices from these groups. Complete story rankings are provided here for : <h> " The Best of the Best " Supplement <p> After researching prior polls and conducting the 1999 effort, it was clear that each poll brought some unique Sherlockian insight to rating the Canon. My article " The Best of the Best " summarizes the history of these appraisals and determines the all-time greatest stories. <p> Results from five polls reported in the BSJ and SHJ between 1944 and 1999 were analyzed to determine the all-time greatest Sherlock Holmes stories.

He helped to re-ignite my Canonical interests and his guidance is much appreciated. Thanks for being a great BSJ Editor! <p> I am always interested in hearing about prior polls and welcome your e-mail on the topic. I am particularly interested in any ballots from the 1944 - 1959 polls and in story scores from the 1989 Sherlock Holmes
