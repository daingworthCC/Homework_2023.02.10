' <p> BY : Garry Wills <p> In certain religious circles, the letters WWJD serve as a password or shibboleth. Web sites sell bracelets and T-shirts with the cryptic motto. Some politicians tell us this watchword guides them in making decisions. The letters stand for " What Would Jesus Do? " We are assured that doing the same thing is the goal of real Christians. <p> But can we really aspire to do what Jesus did? Would we praise a twelve-year-old who slips away from his parents in a big city and lets them leave town without telling them he is staying behind? The reaction of any parent would be that of Jesus ' parents : " How could you treat us this way? "( Lk 2.48).
