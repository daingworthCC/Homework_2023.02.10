This is the rest of his story, about his great American journey from the U.S. Navy to his electrifying run for the presidency, interwoven with heartfelt portraits of the mavericks who have inspired him through the years -- Ted Williams, Theodore Roosevelt, visionary aviation proponent Billy Mitchell, Marlon Brando in Viva Zapata!, and, most indelibly, Robert Jordan.

In 1986, McCain was elected to the U.S. Senate, inheriting the seat of another role model, Barry Goldwater.

Worth the Fighting For reminds us of what 's best in America, Pre-order both items ", " Pre-order all three items " <h> Editorial Reviews <h> From Publishers Weekly <p> McCain, with help from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faith of My Fathers left off, after his release from a North Vietnamese POW prison. After two decades in Congress, he has plenty of stories to tell, beginning with his first experiences on Capitol Hill as a navy liaison to the Senate, where he became friends with men like Henry " Scoop " Jackson and John Tower.( The latter friendship plays a crucial role in McCain 's account of the battle over Tower 's 1989 nomination for defense secretary.) He revisits the " Keating Five " affair that nearly wrecked his career in the early ' 90s, pointedly observing how the investigating Senate committee left him dangling for political reasons long after he 'd been cleared of wrongdoing. There 's much less on his 2000 presidential campaign than one might expect ; a single chapter lingers on a self-lacerating analysis of how he lost the South Carolina primary.( He admits, " I doubt I shall have reason or opportunity to try again " for the White House, and may even consider retiring from the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senator berates himself for speaking recklessly or letting his temper get the best of him. He nevertheless takes pride in his status as a maverick and pays tribute to inspirational figures like Theodore Roosevelt, Ted Williams and Robert Jordan, the fictional protagonist of Hemingway 's For Whom the Bell Tolls. Luckily for McCain, he 's such an engaging storyteller most readers will readily accept these remarkable history. Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc. --This text refers to the Hardcover edition. <p> Senator John McCain 's second volume of autobiography covers his career after his return from captivity in North Vietnam through his unfortunately failed bid for the Presidency in the 2000 elections. As he talks about his life and career, he also discusses those who have inspired and taught him, from history( TR, Billy Mitchell), literature( the Robert Jordan character from " For Whom the Bell Tolls " and Brando 's portrayal of Zapata in " Viva Zapata "), sports( Ted Williams - a great baseball player and a fine Marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own life( late Senators Scoop Jackson, Morris Udall, and John Tower - two of them Democrats, interestingly - among others). These essays mostly stand on their own and are worth the price of admission alone. <p> McCain is honest, sometimes brutally so, about his own failings and errors ; his description of the Keating Five affair is thorough and unsparing, as are his admissions of occasional prevarication and displays of temper. He is no less straightforward about his political experiences. While a dedicated conservative and a believer, his contempt for the near-fascist " Christian " wing of the Republican party is evident, as is his disgust with the treatment former Senator John Tower received when nominated by President George H.W. Bush for the post of Secretary of Defense, a nomination shot down more by far right wingers than by the Democrats. One thing I did miss was his honest appraisal of the current President, but from patriotic motivations McCain may be saving that for later. <p> McCain seems to be suggesting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly over, that his Presidential ambitions are finished. All I can say is that I sincerely hope not. I am a Democrat who would support a McCain run for the Presidency unreservedly. I do not always agree with his views, but I admire his dedication to campaign finance reform, his strength, his candor, his willingness to work with the other side and see them as the loyal opposition rather than as traitors, his courage, and his service to our country. And if McCain never runs for the Presidency, what better final service could he render his country than to lead an effort to return the GOP back to its true core values and rescue it from the clutches of the far right. <p> While there are many politicians who profess to be uncontrollable mavericks who vote strictly based upon their conscience, there are few who do so in actuality. John McCain is one of these few rare creatures that are slowly growing extinct in a political climate that readily denounces instead of encouraging political reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform is pondered by the Supreme Court for its supposed unconstitutionality and concurrently eviscerated by machine politicians such as Mitch McConnell, John McCain continues his admirably idealistic and iconoclastic approach to political reform : It 's worth the fighting for. <p> As the vast multitude of Senators surreptitiously sneak in pork barrel earmarks that waste taxpayers billions of dollars per year, McCain espouses a line item veto - where the President can eliminate such wasteful expenditures while still signing the bill into law. McCain is loath to the inherent corruption and undue influence that soft money has effected upon the election process under the auspices of ostensibly independent ads on the eve of elections. Corruption, pork barrel politics, dishonesty, apathy, and anti-Americanism are all anathema to the most distinguished and honorable Senator in our great country - John McCain. I highly recommend this memoir. Just as McCain does so commendably with his politics, he has put his heart into it as only he can. <p> After reading his other memoir " Faith of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fighting For " as a gift. And what a gift it turned out to be! Senator John McCain proves that he is truly one of the great All-American heroes of our time. <p> This memoir is honest, entertaining, and enlightening. By including the biographies of individuals McCain admired, we gain even better insight into the way John McCain 's mind works. We begin to understand his motivations, his aspirations, and above all, his values. I am almost startled by how TRUTHFUL he is in approaching the challenges and obstacles in his life( running the gamut from his first bid for congress, the Keating Five Scandal, the run for President, and his Campaign Finance Reform movement.) What a life he 's led! <p> I could not have come up with a better title for his work( " Worth the Fighting For "). Senator McCain very clearly demonstrates what he believes are the most important values integral to being a public servant and an American. I read this memoir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many moving and inspirational passages in his work. <p> Although I do n't share the same political views as McCain, I ca n't help but feel an awesome sense of admiration for this man and his accomplishments. His memoir moves past political debates and dialogue... to examining and understanding our deeper core beliefs. <p> My absolute favorite chapters were the ones describing his bid for the Presidency and his efforts in Campaign Finance reform. However, all his biographical sketches were informative and fascinating. Another perk of reading his work, is getting a more personal opinion of the many " famous " elected officials running our nation--it
