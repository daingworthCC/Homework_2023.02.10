" I 'm really busy, so I do n't think I 'll be able to do it, " Lopez told TV Guide Magazine. " I do n't watch the show and did n't even watch when I was on it. My mom a safe and supportive place for writers of all ages to contribute. <p> mario lopez should find the time to do the show. he should be thankful to DWTS for actually giving him his career back. what was he doing before he went on that show, anyway? he had n't acted or done anything since ' saved by the bell. ' <h> Loading comments... <p> Really do n't care for Mario. Ever since I saw his reality show, it made me realize what a control freak he is. This guy will eventually cheat when he gets older and starts to loose his looks because he needs someone to help boost his ego. <h> Loading comments... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gosselin is on the All-Star show. As badly as she danced, it is her attitude that turns me off the most. The only person more horrible than Kate is.... Octomom! <h> Loading comments... <p> DWTS getting desparate? Need an all star season? Stopped watching several seasons ago when the show changed so many rules that the fan vote meant nothing. And the three stooges judges are still all there. Time
