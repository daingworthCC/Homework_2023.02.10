5099041 <p> The sex scandal that ended CIA Director David Petraeus ' career has widened to include a second top general who reportedly traded up to 30,000 pages of emails and other documents with a Florida socialite. Gen. John Allen, who succeeded Petraeus as commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, is under investigation for trading potentially inappropriate and " flirtatious " emails with Jill Kelley, the woman who complained of receiving harassing emails from Petraeus ' mistress, Paula Broadwell. The four figures in the four-star scandal appear to be linked by MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla., the headquarters of U.S. Central Command, where Petraeus was once the commander and Allen was his deputy, and where Kelley volunteered as a " social liaison. " Allen had been tapped to lead the U.S. European Command and NATO forces in Europe, but that nomination is now on hold as the investigation proceeds. A Pentagon official traveling with Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on a visit to Australia said " inappropriate communications " -- an astonishing 20,000 to 30,000 pages of emails and other documents exchanged by Allen and Kelley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Kelley 's complaints of harassing emails from Broadwell that led to the FBI 's discovery of an affair between Petraeus and Broadwell, which the general admitted Friday when he resigned. Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, called the latest revelations in the case " a Greek tragedy, " saying, " This has the elements in some ways of a Hollywood movie or a trashy novel.

Both wrote letters in support of Natalie Khawam, who was sharply criticized as dishonest by the judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loving relationship -- a mother working hard to provide her son enjoyable, educational and developmental experiences, " Petraeus said in September, referring to an occasion when he hosted Khawam 's family for Christmas dinner. " It is clear to me that John would benefit from much more time with his mother and from removal of the burdensome restrictions imposed on her when she does get to spend time with him. " But Superior Court Judge Neal Kravitz wrote in November 2011 : " Ms. Khawam appears to lack any appreciation or respect for the importance of honesty and integrity in her interactions with her family, employers and others with whom she comes in contact. " He awarded Khawam 's ex-husband custody of their 3-year-old son and ordered her to pay $350,000 worth of his legal bills. She had made repeated claims of abuse, which the judge called " an ever-expanding set of sensational accusations " that were " numerous, " " extraordinary, " and " so distorted that they defy any common-sense view of reality.

The most urgent priority is to reach a compromise to keep from going over the " fiscal cliff " of huge mandatory spending cuts and tax increases that will kick in Jan. 1 if not averted. President Barack Obama is meeting with the leaders of the House and Senate from both parties to try to forge a deal. Some Democrats are urging congressional colleagues to let the government go over that cliff, at least temporarily, to gain political leverage over Republicans who adamantly oppose higher tax rates for the wealthy. Hearings are also planned this week on the events surrounding the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four <p> Shena Hardin smokes a cigarette as she holds up a sign to serve a highly public sentence Tuesday in Cleveland for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unloading children.( Tony Dejak/AP Photo) <p> Americans. The Senate on Tuesday was scheduled to take up more mundane business -- whether 41 polar bear carcasses killed before a 2008 ban on polar bear trophy imports can be brought into the U.S. from Canada. And the House was expected to approve legislation that would exclude U.S. airlines from emissions requirements that the European Union has sought to impose on all planes flying to and from Europe. <p> A Cleveland woman who drove on a sidewalk to pass a school bus was forced to stand in the cold for an hour Tuesday holding a sign that read : " Only an idiot would drive on the sidewalk to avoid a school bus. " A Cleveland Municipal Court judge ordered Shena Hardin, 32, to hold up the sign for one hour Tuesday and Wednesday for the Sept. 11 citation. Lisa Kelley, whose 9-year-old daughter rides the same school bus, said Hardin is a remorseless repeat offender. " She 's an idiot, just like her sign says, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, her head down and her eyes hidden by dark glasses. " She did this almost every day last year. She wo n't stop laughing. She 's not remorseful, she laughed at every court appearance. She 's still laughing, so she needs to be humiliated like this.
