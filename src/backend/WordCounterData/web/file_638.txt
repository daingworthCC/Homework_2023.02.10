But with a deceptively sunny disposition and some whistling, Foster the People 's debut single " Pumped Up Kicks " was absolutely everywhere after its September 2010 release and became the soundtrack of summer. <p> Likely the calmest member of Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All, Frank Ocean 's R &B; makeout tunes needed a separate place to thrive. Enter the Internet, where his debut mixtape " Nostalgia, Ultra " gained both critical and street cred, and landed him studio time with Beyonce, Jay-Z and Kanye West. <p> Signed to Jay-Z 's label Roc Nation, rapper J. Cole has been making his mark solo with his series of popular mixtapes, and also as a guest on almost everyone 's tracks. J. 's collaborated with Drake, Wale, and B.o.B., to name a few, and he recently opened for labelmate Rihanna. <p> You can thank producer/DJ/EDM kingpin Skrillex for the hundreds of videos on the internet featuring cats dancing to Dubstep. The dude not only helped make EDM @ @ @ @ @
