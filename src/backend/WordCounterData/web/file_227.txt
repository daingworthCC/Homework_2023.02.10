5049341 <h> Help Solve an Open Murder Case, Part 2 <p> Your help unlocking the mystery of two encrypted notes could solve a 1999 murder. <p> Update : This story has generated an outpouring of responses. To accommodate the continuing interest in this case, we have established a page( http : //forms.fbi.gov/code) where the public can offer their comments and theories about the coded messages. <p> On June 30, 1999, sheriff 's officers in St. Louis, Missouri discovered the body of 41-year-old Ricky McCormick. He had been murdered and dumped in a field. The only clues regarding the homicide were two encrypted notes found in the victim 's pants pockets. <p> Despite extensive work by our Cryptanalysis and Racketeering Records Unit( CRRU), as well as help from the American Cryptogram Association, the meanings of those two coded notes remain a mystery to this day, and Ricky McCormick 's murderer has yet to face justice. <p> " We are really good at what we do, " said CRRU chief Dan Olson, " but we could use some help with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encrypted notes are one of CRRU 's top unsolved cases. " Breaking the code, " said Olson, " could reveal the victim 's whereabouts before his death and could lead to the solution of a homicide. Not every cipher we get arrives at our door under those circumstances. " <p> To move the case forward, examiners need another sample of murder-victim Ricky McCormick 's coded system -- or a similar one -- that might offer context to the mystery notes or allow comparisons to be made. <p> The more than 30 lines of coded material use a maddening variety of letters, numbers, dashes, and parentheses. McCormick was a high school dropout, but he was able to read and write and was said to be " street smart. " According to members of his family, McCormick had used such encrypted notes since he was a boy, but apparently no one in his family knows how to decipher the codes, and it 's unknown whether anyone besides McCormick could translate his secret language. Investigators believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three days before his death. <p> Breaking any code involves four basic steps : <p> 1. determining the language used ; 2. determining the system used ; 3. reconstructing the key ; and 4. reconstructing the plaintext. <p> Consider this cipher : Nffu nf bu uif qbsl bu oppo. <p> Now apply the four steps : 1. Determining the language allows you to compare the cipher text to the suspected language. Our cryptanalysts usually start with English. <p> 3. Reconstructing the key : This step answers the question of how the code maker changed the letters. In our example, every character shifted one letter to the right in the alphabet. <p> 4. Reconstructing the plaintext : By applying the key from the previous step, you now have a solution : Meet me at the park at noon. <p> Over the years, a number of CRRU 's examiners -- who are experts at breaking codes -- have puzzled over the McCormick notes and applied a variety of analytical techniques to tease out an answer. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " Olson noted. Our cryptanalysts have several plausible theories about the notes, but so far, there has been no solution. <p> To move the case forward, examiners need another sample of McCormick 's coded system -- or a similar one -- that might offer context to the mystery notes or allow valuable comparisons to be made. Or, short of new evidence, Olson said, " Maybe someone with a fresh set of eyes might come up with a brilliant new idea. " <p> That 's where the public comes in. The FBI has always relied on tips and other assistance from the public to solve crimes, and although breaking a code may represent a special circumstance, your help could aid the investigation.
