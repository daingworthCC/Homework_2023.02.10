5030141 <h> VIDEO ON MSN MONEY <p> I remember when trash service was $3.00/month. The trash guy came through the side gate and got the can, dumped it, then returned it to it 's place. Most gas stations gave great service. I remember telling the attendant the tail lights were out. He examined the fuses, found the culprit, installed a new fuse and charged me $1.00, the price of the fuse. Same thing for wipers. Try that today and see how fast you are charged the ' minimum diagnostic fee ' of $95.00. <p> I still ca n't believe I have to pay 75 cents to put air in my tires, geez! A pack of gum was a nickle when I was a kid, in the grocery checkout the other day I saw that the same exact brand I bought as a kid is now two dollars and fifteen cents. <p> Another thing I remember was stores and gas stations that gave " blue chip " or " S &H; Green " stamps.

Folks can not learn to live within their means - they have to have all the gadgets which are obsele the moment you pay your hard-earned money for it. Greed starts at the very top and works its way down. <p> This is Linda Likens and I can remember when auto diagnostics was free, they gave that to you to earn your business, They charged me $270 to replace my car battery the other day, fotr a $100 battery. Included both diagnostic and labor fees... a little salty for me! I said " honestly " and just shook my head and wrote the check.
