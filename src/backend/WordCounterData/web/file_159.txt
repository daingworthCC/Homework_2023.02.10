5042441 <h> Men <h> Women <p> For two weeks at the French Open, Rafael Nadal looked unbeatable, his mastery of clay confirmed again. Yet as Nadal climbed into the stands on Monday for a raucous celebration and an awkward hug with Lakers forward Pau Gasol, the clay-court season ended, as did Nadal 's sizable edge over his opposition. <p> Even then, it seemed as if he could sense the landscape shifting, from red to green to blue. As Nadal heads into the grass-court season and the hardcourt one beyond that, it would be foolish to think he will not contend for a title in every tournament. But he must also contend with Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer and others under conditions that are more favorable to them. <p> " I won four titles already this year in my favorite court. That 's clay, " Nadal said, as if his audience needed a reminder. " I do n't have that chance to play in my favorite court the rest of the season. That 's the calendar. " <p> Last year, Nadal won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trophy and headed off into the rest of the season. He did not win another tournament. It 's not that he played poorly, even if there were some rough patches in Montreal, Cincinnati and Shanghai. But Nadal still made the final at Wimbledon and at the United States Open, where he lost to Djokovic both times. <p> The questions now, since Nadal 's triumph at the French is the closest thing in tennis to a given, is whether he is playing at a level higher than in 2011 and whether that will carry over as the season chugs along. Nadal maintained he is playing better than he did last season, even on his favorite surface. <p> His rivalry with Djokovic should be central to the narrative of the rest of the season, although Federer remains a threat. Nadal has played in the last five Grand Slam finals, but lost three of them to Djokovic and won only at the French, albeit twice. <p> " You have to find your moments, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect every time. I going to try to keep having chances to win, produce chances to win. I produced a lot of chances to win last year, but I lost almost every one. " <p> That was why Monday was so important, and less for the record at Roland Garros and more for Nadal 's own psyche. When rain delayed the final overnight, Nadal later admitted he felt nervous, anxious, and he read the same comic book three times before he fell asleep. <p> In his news conference, Nadal called his latest contest with Djokovic a " very complex final. " Nadal said as he listened to Spain 's national anthem, he thought about what it felt like to lose the final match of three consecutive Grand Slams, thought about how, as he gets older, " you give more value to these precious moments. " <p> Nadal, in response to a question about his superiority on clay, said fear had always driven him. He said his mental makeup, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was most central to his clay success. <p> But there is another side to that, and it seemed evident at both the United States Open and the Australian Open that Djokovic had dented Nadal 's confidence. <p> On Monday, as he held the silver French Open trophy in front of him, Nadal read the names of the champions who came before. He looked as assured as ever. And in his rivalry with Djokovic, where matches are won or lost by the slimmest margins, that last sliver of confidence can make the difference. He even sounded different than he had before. <p> " I ca n't deny this was probably my best season on clay, " Nadal said. <p> Downstairs from where Nadal spoke, his uncle and coach, Toni Nadal, said his nephew was unlucky to be born in the same era as Federer and Djokovic, two champions in their own right. The three of them have won 28 of the last 29 Grand Slam titles. <p> For years, Nadal staged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now with Djokovic. Nadal has 11 Grand Slam singles titles to show for it, but Toni Nadal seemed to say that in another era, his nephew would have won far more. <p> Nadal did not necessarily agree with that assessment. He said he felt lucky and unlucky all at once. The players, he said again, must pick their moments, give themselves a chance. <p> Near the end of Nadal 's news conference, he was asked if he knew that Borg retired at 26, the same age Nadal turned last week. He shook his head and took questions in Spanish, then left the grounds and the red clay upon which he has lost only once in his career. The grass at Wimbledon awaited. <p> " Is impossible the future, no? " he said. <h> A version of this article appeared in print on June 13, 2012, on page B 15 of the New York edition with the headline : For
