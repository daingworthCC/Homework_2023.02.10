5070741 <p> The Timberwolves ended the preseason ranked first defensively in the NBA in fewest points and lowest field-goal percentage allowed. <p> Yep, you read that right. <p> The same franchise that allowed 152 points in a game three seasons ago and surrendered 120 or more points a dozen times two seasons ago allowed opponents 80.9 points and a 38.3 shooting percentage in seven preseason games. <p> " I understand the preseason is a little different from the regular season and definitely different from the playoffs, " Wolves forward Andrei Kirilenko said. " But I think it 's a good start. We all know great offense makes you excited, but only defense can win you the game. " <p> The Wolves limited Detroit and Milwaukee to fewer than 20 points in four of the preseason 's final eight quarters with a defense that lacks a classic individual shutdown defender but has compensated for it so far -- and it 's way early -- with scheme and attention to detail. <p> " I always heard Coach likes to work on offense early in camp, but this year we really got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard Brandon Roy said. " We put a lot of work into it. " <p> " I think we can be pretty good if we 're picking up what the other team is trying to do and if we have each other 's back, " Adelman said. " It 's a matter of trust, really. We 're going to try to make them go to a different option rather than go to their strengths. " <p> Adelman looks back to last season and sees a team that defended well until Ricky Rubio went down because of a knee injury and Kevin Love and Nikola Pekovic each were lost for part of the season 's final six weeks. <p> " The last 20 games last year, we were n't very good, " Adelman said. " We 're trying to be better. We 're trying to be more consistent. That 's what we 've been talking about since Day 1. " <p> And the talk has been about " team " defense, the concept that they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other out when a mistake is made and the defense is about to break down. <p> " There are five of us out there, we 're all looking to help each other, " forward Dante Cunningham said. " There 's not one guy out there that necessarily locks down someone per se, but we have a lot of guys who are going to give help and make sure our team looks great defensively. <p> " If you look at the makeup of our team, we 've got such energy guys, such athletic guys all the way around, that defense kind of is second nature to us. " <p> Adelman is eighth in NBA career victories with 971, a number usually credited to his offensive mind rather than his attention to defense. <p> " I think sometimes he may get a little overlooked because he really is a good offensive coach and his teams do a great job of running plays, " Roy said. " But I played against his teams in Houston and they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Artest and Shane Battier. Those guys are defensive-minded. I always felt those were good defensive teams. " <p> Adelman knows that leading the league in two prominent preseason defensive categories means nothing come Friday night 's season opener against Sacramento at Target Center. <p> " Obviously when you get to the regular season, things will be harder, " he said. " But I think it 's a good learning tool for us. Hopefully players will understand that 's how we 're going to win, defending consistently night after night. I think we 've done that so far. We 've been able to stay consistent and I 'd rather start there and have some basis to build on. <p> " That 's going to be part of our identity. We have to win defensively. We have to be able to guard people. " <p> Roy bangs knee <p> Roy was limited in practice on Monday after banging knees with a teammate. Adelman said Roy was held out from most of practice as a precaution and @ @ @ @
