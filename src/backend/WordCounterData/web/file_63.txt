5032841 <p> And make no mistake : This book came out of nowhere. It started as Twilight fanfiction, then was released as an e-book and POD paperback by Writers ' Coffee Shop in Australia. From there it managed to attract so much word-of-mouth attention and sales it was acquired for a rumored near-million dollars by Vintage Books, part of Random House, and has gone on to aforementioned further massive success. <p> The publishing industry did not see this one coming. I think it 's safe to say that virtually no one did. Even five years ago it 's hard to see how this book would have rocketed to such success so quickly, if would have found its way to publication at all( I 'm guessing it would n't have). <p> But note that Fifty Shades of Grey needed a publisher to get truly big. Publishers may not have seen it coming, but they caught up to it very quickly. I would n't use this as an opportunity to sneer at publishers. The industry 's role as gatekeeper is changing quickly, it 's likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past and cared too much about writing quality, but they 're still making money on this hand over fist. <p> 3) It 's not as bad people say it is <p> Given the howls have accompanied this book 's success and the snarky takedowns, I was really expecting drivel. <p> It 's not drivel. It 's not Shakespeare, but from a prose perspective I would call it competently written. <p> Yes, there are writerly tics, yes there are elements that are implausible, yes yes OMG a helicopter called Charlie Tango, more on all that in a minute. But the end of the world for books this is not. <p> I 've read worse. <p> 4) That said... <p> I 'm not exactly an expert, but I can see why some people have wondered aloud if this is one step back for feminism. Much of the book hinges on very confused 21-year-old virginal Anastasia, seemingly plucked straight out of the 1950s, wondering whether this 27-year-old experienced, **26;9778;TOOLONG self-made billionaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean really really really likes her. <p> Their times apart consist mainly of Anastasia confusedly spurning the advances of other men who are interested in her, talking herself out of the notion that Christian Grey no I mean really likes her, and finding new reasons to feel jealous about his past, aided and impeded by both her subconscious and inner goddess( separate voices!), who alternately scold her and high five her for her adventurousness. Anastasia has few thoughts, feelings, emotions, or ambitions regarding anything other than how much Christian Grey actually truly no I mean really likes her and whether she can abide by the terms of the written contract and tortured legalese( in more ways than one) that governs their relationship. <p> Christian Grey is the type of person who will scare Anastasia to death then introduce her to his mom, leave her bruised and then soulfully play the piano, all the while being so stricken by his attraction for Anastasia( including, it ca n't be said enough times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is willing to break all sorts of previously unbendable rules, such as being affectionate and sleeping in the same bed as her until, spoiler, whiting this part out, select it with your cursor if you want to read this : she concludes after a savage spanking that much as the great Meat Loaf sang, she would do anything for love but she wo n't do that. <p> Well. At least pending the sequels. <p> This, ladies and gentlemen, is one of the very most popular books of all time. <p> 5) So, um, why is it so popular? <p> Needless to say, I am not exactly the target audience for this book. <p> But even I can see how Fifty Shades of Grey fits neatly into a very old archetype that continues to resonate in our culture. The aloof, successful, mysterious, wildly attractive rogue who shows interest in a woman despite her initial resistance and even after that man warns the woman about himself : It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane Eyre to Pride and Prejudice to Twilight to Fifty Shades of Grey and countless other iterations. It 's a new spin on a very old trope : romantic entanglement with a Byronic hero. <p> I also do n't think it 's only women who are prone to stories of an ardent and attractive suitor arriving to shake up their life, as the manic pixie dream girl movie genre can attest. Many heterosexual guys seemingly want a hot girl to come along and take care of everything as well, preferably when she 's played by Natalie Portman or Zooey Deschanel. <p> Fifty Shades of Grey may not break new ground, but surely it benefited from being released in the Kindle / iPad era( where onlookers ca n't easily see/judge what you 're reading), it gave an urbane veneer to a romance genre that very often skews rural/suburban, and if you 'll excuse the metaphor, Twilight may well have primed the pump for a book that maintains the same archetypal romantic dynamic while allowing its protagonists to consummate their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward chartering new gender and relationship dynamics with more sensitive guys and greater equality there 's some appetite to escape into a story with a less complicated and familiar throwback to a dominant man and submissive woman. Maybe we 've become such a sexually open society people were ready for the needle of mainstream edginess to be moved a little farther over. Maybe Christian Grey and his dorkily named helicopter are just that hot. <p> The " book "( notice i use quotes) is only popular because when it was posted on Fanfiction(dot)net it had over 50,000 reviews. The Writers coffee shop solicits popular fanfic writers to publish their fics, then use their readers to make the fanfics sell and end up on the new york times. <p> Have n't read it, but from what I understand, it 's mostly a book about dirty( in the best possible sense of the word) sex. <p> My two cents : Women were taught for a million years to suppress their sexuality. Men were n't. Now, generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embrace sex. And, in our world today,( especially young women) wear their sexuality as a badge of honor. <p> I 'm a college professor. Many students follow me on Twitter, so I follow them back. These women are n't readers, but almost all of them read 50 Shades, posted pictures of them reading it at the pool, tweeted how much they loved it, etc. <p> In my opinion, it 's not about the book itself. It 's what the book represents. Older women may have been hiding it on their e-readers, but younger women were flaunting it. <p> Trust me, these young women talk about sex on Twitter WAY MORE than any of my male students.( One former student recently posted that her favorite flavor of popsicle was slang for male genitalia. We 're living through a cultural shift, and books that tap into that will be wildly popular. <p> Because EL James already had an audience, she went from fan fiction to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled that gap for Twilight readers who wanted something saucier and were just a little in love with the MCs from the movie version. Kudos to EL for getting MOTU published under Fifty Shades. She worked hard for it. Let 's not think this was an overnight sensation. <p> I wonder if " random " bestsellers are made from books that people want to talk about. In order to talk about a book -- even if it 's only to vent loudly with all your complaints about the absurdity -- you need other people to have read it, which means you need to convince your friends to read it. I have n't read Fifty Shades, but I know with both Twilight and Hunger Games, I read them because friends told me to and then I told friends to read them so we could talk about them. It was n't that I loved Twilight -- I thought it was a horrible message for teenage girls, blah-blah-blah. But I still convinced at least two or three people to read it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least that many people to read it, probably several more, so I could talk to them about what made Katniss a great heroine and why she was different and whether she was a new archetype in female characters, etc. Funny, thinking back, a friend sent me a UK book once that she 'd picked up on a layover, Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone, and I talked up that book to everyone I knew because I wanted to discuss the layers and the descriptions and sense of humor. Obviously, that 's not the case for all bestsellers, but it might explain some of the more unusual ones. <p> I do n't think we should ignore the brilliance of the cover design, which has changed the covers of erotica books forever. That understated symbol of male power, the simple necktie--in subtle shades of gray instead of screaming pink flesh tones--made the book LOOK respectable. It also appealed to what really turns women on, which is power, not little Magic Mike outfits. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that understood women 's fantasies. <p> When you call something " not that bad " and, again, " I 've read worse " with the same breath as noting that it made a commercial splash in publishing the likes of which all the National Book Awards Finalists together will not make in a hundred years, you have affirmed that the dichotomy between art and commerce is getting ever larger. <p> I venture a guess that this is a case of people purchasing the book because of the hype, but not necessarily finding it to be their cup of tea. Harry Potter has 5951 customer reviews on Amazon, with an overall rating of 4.7 out of 5, while Fifty Shades has 13,840 reviews with an overall rating of 3.2. My quick analysis of those statistics tell me that people are obviously snatching it up left and right, not necessarily enjoying it. I 've talked to many people who have bought/read the book and I have yet to meet one who thought it was a decent story and many did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POPULAR? I 'd say a better word is notorious. I believe people are buying the book to see what the fuss is about and why people like us keep talking about it. <p> I think its two fold : First, EL James writes about Mr Grey like she 's in love with him and is indulging in her own personal fantasy. Same with Stephenie Meyer writing about Edward Cullen. This makes it easy for the reader to also fall in love with them and hence, become addicted. Secondly, both authors play to the fantasy of the plain, everyday woman( ie the reader) being worshipped and adored by an extraordinary male who is on the face of it, out of their league. Because the female protagonists Bella and Anastsasia are just like us, it gives us hope that the same could happen to us too. <p> 1) Its vast popularity made it " cool " to say you were reading it, whereas usual readers of erotica romance keep it to themselves -- hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The books popularity attracted new readers to the genre who never knew they could read " porn " and like it. I had so many FB friends taking pictures of them reading the book by the pool or talking about reading it this past year. Then some would ask for similar books like it. <p> 3) The book cover. The usual erotic romance novels have the embarrassing covers with the half naked man on the cover embracing a female. <p> Honestly, I hated the book. I could n't get over the immaturity of the main character. I do n't what anything to do with an erotica book whose main character reads like a 16 year old. <p> Why is it popular? 1. People read between the lines. I 've had discussions with a friend who liked the book and her interpretation and mine are totally different. She saw romance, I saw domestic violence, and I do n't mean the physicality of the book, but the emotional. <p> 2. One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do things she did n't fully want to do in hopes she could change him. I 'm not sure where this came from, but many girls/women suffer from the idea that men show true love by changing for the woman. The bad guy starts of exciting, and then we try to change all the things that we were excited about. And when they give those up, it must be true love. <p> 3. Sex sells <p> 4. Popularity leads to more popularity. Either from curiosity or the assumption that if everyone is reading it then it must be good. <p> It 's been interesting to follow the secretive reading( only your best friends whisperingly admit they 've read it in all-female company) to seeing women read it at my gym and on airplanes. A male friend was on a flight where his entire ROW was reading it( all strangers) and he when asked what the big deal about it is, a multi-row conversation began where all the readers urged him to read it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nowhere. It did n't come out of close to nowhere. <p> The original fanfictions were so popular and had so many fans that they organized their own fan event and flew her from the UK to the US to attend. When the books went on sale, that fanbase responded in droves. The sudden spike by someone who had never had a novel for sale before caught the attention of Amazon 's algorithms. The original fans shared the book with their friends who snapped up every hard copy they could find and happily downloaded the e-version for clandestine reading. They got to feel like they were doing something " naughty "( oh, how I hate that word when applied to adults in a serious manner...) <p> ELJames has basically the same story as every other success with a built-in fanbase. She gave those who already knew her what they expected and wanted, and in turn those people supported the writer they enjoy. They spread the word to people who likely had never heard of fanfiction, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Though, hopefully, none of them confused it with Between Shades of Grey( or vice versa). That could make for some awkward reading. <p> I did n't manage to read past the first 2 chapters which were offered as a the free preview on my Kobo - I did n't want to waste my time and money after that, despite Kobo trying to sell it to me on every page of their website. Opening with her looking in the mirror was enough to put my hackels up. But as my father was a pilot, your mention of the helicopter name makes absolute sense to me. Charlie Tango is the radio call signal so the helicopter would be CT followed by a number. My father 's plane was Charlie Whiskey Foxtrot. Unlike ships and boats, flying beasts do n't often get called romantic names. <p> @Josin I read an article about Ruta Septys ' Between Shades of Grey tour this year, and she did have people come expecting the author for 50 Shades. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying this book based on hype but I have n't heard much posistive on my end. One of my good friends who mainly reads non-fiction and self-help said she got the books because they were " something to read. " That 's pitiful to me. You can read a cereal box, too. But she said she wanted to see what the hype was about and none of the mysogyny bothered her. It bothers me. And the bad writing does too. I read a chapter and could n't take it. For me, I have so many books on my list to read, I 'm not looking for just anything to read because it 's popular. If the reviews were stellar, yes, I would give it a chance. <p> I think it 's popular because it is naughty. And because everyone is reading it( or at least every female it seems, including your grandma), it gives one permission to read it. So it becomes insanely popular. And because e-readers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what all the fuss is about. That 's why I read it. I wanted to know what I was missing. <p> Yet it 's not really that naugthy, and at times the sex is downright awkward. I will admit the cover is awesome, and if this shabbily written book makes readers aware that erotica exists, I guess something positive comes out of its mere existence. <p> I just realized that my comment rambled on way too long, so I deleted it. I tend to be in constant essay mode, so sorry about that long comment. <p> The heroine of Fifty Shades was portrayed as the intelligent virgin. She 's career-oriented ; a model we can look up to. There are more graphic sex novels out there, but we can feel validated in knowing that this is n't just sex--there 's a moral to be learned. <p> The pure female character changes the rich, powerful man. In this way, it seems as though the female holds a special power over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is powerful and intelligent. <p> Her power is an illusion that the reader is happy to look right through because it validates our desire to indulge in a book where male dominates female--something that would usually be seen as anti-woman today. <p> I think this satisfaction one receives from watching an intelligent woman enjoy being dominated is where the intrigue of this book is rooted. We want the mental and physical dominance, and we want to justify it. <p> The danger in holding up such heroines as a role model, though, is that it perpetuates this idea that all women want to be dominated. They may resist at first, but deep down, they want it. <p> You really did n't think it was that badly written? Um, are you sure you read Fifty Shades of Grey? I read the first two( wo n't even bother with the third one) and wondered how something like that got could get published( and NOT re-edited!) As a woman who does n't mind BDSM, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and poor editing bothered me. Tell me that you did n't find yourself editing it as you read it! <p> I believe that Fifty Shades is popular because the author has written most things well( sex scenes, descriptive details, lush language...) but she also did one thing very, very well... she made the readers totally relate to the protagonist. Anastasia would dismiss one thing after another( while biting her lower lip) only to work herself around to the idea as the pages flipped by( rather quickly) and I was right there with her... even if I am 3 times older! As you say, it is not Shakespeare but it is a GOOD read. <p> I have not read this book. However as the wife of a private pilot I know where the helicopters name came from and it makes perfect sense. When we call a tower we give our planes call letters which consist of numbers followed by letters. C=Charley and T=Tango at every tower where planes fly. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading it because everyone else I know read it. My sister read the trilogy then shipped her copies to me. Got them for free... Of course I 'm going to read them... then loan them out to every friend of mine who has n't read them and wants to. They really are n't so great I would want to pay to read them. EVER. I could n't even be bothered to sign up on the wait list at my local library to read them. <p> And I do NOT understand why they are so insanely popular. Sure, they are based on Twilight fanfiction, but does n't that fact alone sort of make it terrible that they 've become so popular? The characters are rip-offs of someone else 's work! <p> Yes, it is true, no matter what some women may say, many women like &; want to be dominated, but more importantly, they want a man who knows this without having to ask &; possibly embarrass them by making them admit it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what he wants &; still feel like they are strong women who had no choice, when actually they did. Some women feel guilty or sleazy to have these desires, so if a man can satisfy their fantasy without them acknowledging it even IS their fantasy, then that 's the perfect scenario. And 50SoG feeds into &; satisfies that in women who know they 'll never get it. And maybe, if they 're lucky, their men will want to know why they like the book so much &; they can admit without feeling bad about themselves. <p> I was blown away when I discovered that my super macho fireman lover was reading 50 Shades of Grey.( His sister-in-law gave it to him?) I was unwilling to pay for a book I 'd heard so much negative criticism about, but when he gave me his copy( and pointed out some similarities between the characters ' and our relationship), I could n't help but devour the thing. It was mildly titillating, but annoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a result( so many other books are, I believe more worthy of my precious time). <p> The point I 'm trying to make in a rather round about way is that this book appealed to people you 'd never guess would like it and it contained just enough " average female angst " with respect to relationship dynamics that I think many women could sympathize. The incorporation of email dialogue modernized the couple 's interaction and was something I particularly connected with. <p> As far as the argument that this book is anti-feminist, well, yes, I suppose it is, but there has been so much dialogue surrounding its popularity that surely the less " enlightened " women reading it have had the concerns regarding that aspect of the work drummed into their tiny little heads so much so that the book has certainly served to open up dialogue that, as far as I know, has n't been at the fore of social commentary for quite a long time. It got us talking. That 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting and watching for this blog! I agree wholeheartedly with your insights and loved the method you used to hide the spoiler. Cool. <p> My own experience of 50 Shades began day when I discovered that my uber-macho, fireman lover was reading it. I was blown away and my curiosity was naturally piqued. I 'd been unwilling to pay for a book I 'd heard so much negative criticism about, but when he gave me his copy( and pointed out some similarities between the characters ' and our relationship), I could n't help but devour the thing. It was mildly titillating and admittedly great foreplay, but annoying as heck, and I 've resisted reading the sequels as a result so many books, so little time). <p> The point I 'm trying to make is that this book appealed to people you 'd never guess would like it and it contained more than enough " female angst " to make " average " women like myself sympathize with the protagonist. The incorporation of email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anastasia could express herself more fully in that medium than when faced with the knee-weakening Grey was something I related to in particular. <p> As far as the argument that this book is anti-feminist, well, yes, I suppose it is, but there has been so much dialogue surrounding its popularity that surely the less " enlightened " women reading it have had the concerns regarding that aspect of the work drummed into their tiny little heads so much so that the book has certainly served to reignite dialogue that, as far as I know, has n't been at the fore of social commentary for quite some time. It got us talking. That 's a good thing, right? <p> I think it was said already, but erotic romantic ebooks are a huge industry. I 'm surprised that anyone is surprised by this. Many millions of dollars are made in the erotica genre. They used to call them bodice rippers, did n't they? This particular book is very accessible and, as you said, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've ever read but it is n't at all the worst. It was also well publicized and the author knew how to put it together in a fairly polished manner. <p> First, it was such a blatant rip-off of Twilight that I was offended on Stephenie Meyer 's behalf. If someone did that with my work, I 'd want royalties. I felt that it should have matured past fan-fiction before selling a bazillion copies. <p> In the same vein, the characters were flat as a pancake. Flatter even than Stephenie Meyer 's, which is impressive. Anastasia 's constant shock at Christian Grey 's appetites, despite the fact that they were pretty clear from the outset, was exhausting, as was the endless lip biting and obsessing about the way Mr. Grey 's pants hung off of him.( Did he need a smaller size?) <p> Finally, I just found it a bit, well, unbelievable. Perhaps I 'm a prude, but I could n't help but think that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know who has read it has done so because " everyone is reading it. " None of my friends have admitted to liking it, but they all sought it out in the first place because of the peer pressure. There 's a social component to bestsellerdom : once a book reaches the tipping point, everyone else reads it to see what the others are talking about. I saw this happen with The Da Vinci Code, too. <p> How does a book build to that tipping point in the first place? I 'm not sure anyone really knows. Whatever 50 Shades has in terms of romantic and erotic elements, there are other books that have it too, but never sell as widely. Perhaps the fan base that others mentioned was critical in building the initial buzz. <p> I do n't think it 's anything new to publishing to have these huge sensations, to have a book that 's The It Book. But because that ca n't be forced, and that kind of success ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it, chasing the dream and hoping that the lightning strikes. <p> The only problem with the comparison of the Byronic romance with the Magic Pixie Dream Girl -- and I think you might be on to something there -- is that while in the Byronic fantasy, the woman is young and naive and sacrifices her own pursuit of happiness for her man, in the MPDG fantasy, the woman is young and naive and sacrifices her own pursuit of happiness for her man. <p> Ha - yeah, maybe. But in both cases I think they 're about " unlocking " something inside of the woman/man. The heroine confronting the Byronic hero must give in to temptation, the man in the MPDG story must waken to the world anew. <p> In both archetypes the man is ostensibly giving something up too. The Byronic hero letting himself be tamed, the MPDG hero loses his powerful cynicism which allegedly weakens him -- one reason why he does n't usually end up with the MPDG. <p> " Maybe, at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atrociously written pile of poo has you using clichs such as " at the end of the day ", without even understanding what it 's done to you. Really Nathan... <p> I 've never read it however, I ca n't help but feel a trifle irritated by the fact that everyone, from television to blogosphere, talks about this book endlessly. And did n't the book come out months ago? Enough, already. There are other well-deserving books out there that would like to be talked about too! However, I have to say, kudos to E.L. James for doing an amazing job of selling her own book : -) Yvette Carol <p> It was just announced last week that another popular Twilight fanfic called " The Office, " just scored a two-book deal with Gallery Books. And let 's not forget " Gabriel 's Inferno &; Gabriel 's Rapture "( in the fanfic world known as " The University of Edward Masen ") was recently published by Penguin 's Berkeley imprint. Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fandom. As an author who has been trying to get published, I 'm thinking of changing my MC names to Edward and Bella... LOL! <p> It was just announced last week that another popular Twilight fanfic called " The Office, " just scored a two-book deal with Gallery Books. And let 's not forget " Gabriel 's Inferno &; Gabriel 's Rapture "( in the fanfic world known as " The University of Edward Masen ") was recently published by Penguin 's Berkeley imprint. Both of these had a huge fan base in the Twilight fandom. As an author who has been trying to get published, I 'm thinking of changing my MC names to Edward and Bella... LOL! <p> I was interested in reading it because it was supposedly a mainstream representation of BDSM. But the whole plot seemed to be that only damaged, abused people engage in BDSM, and the love of a good woman will cure them of their perversion. Yikes! Not to mention the fact that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only does what the sub enjoys and nothing more. So Christian pressuring Ana to do things that make her cry all the time is n't him being dominant, it 's him being a jerk. <p> @ Anne R. Allen - I agree that some women want to be dominated, but some studies have shown that an equal, or even greater, number of men want to be dominated, too. How 's that for setting gender sterotypes on its ears. :) <p> So, she really wants him to really, really like her? While biting her lower lip? Really, really biting? <p> So, I agree with Jan Priddy, this seems like a paternalistic archtype. <p> It 's the archtype of a girl who is abused/neglected and/or unloved by her father, earning his care, attention and love by having him finally see her ' goodness '. <p> The sexualization of a father/daughter relationship is, in part, about release of tension. When the abuse stops, it feels like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific books become popular for all the reasons that people are saying : word of mouth, the titillation, the water-cooler effect, etc. <p> But the archtype of an abused daughter finding paternal love, where her father figure transforms from a distant " monster " to a loving man, can be found all over and is extremely popular, starting, perhaps, with the Beauty and the Beast fairytale. <p> Twilight was definitely the same archtype. And you find it in tons of romance books, which are read by millions of women( and men). <p> There is a sad part to this, though. The intense popularity of this particular archtype speaks to how many people felt abused and/or neglected by their fathers. That 's sad, and very real. <p> I am wondering if you read the whole series or just the first book? Because if you have just read the first one then you are truly missing out ;) <p> I read the first book because I swear every girl in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was. Although, at first I did try to resist and be the conservative southern girl I was raised to be, but curiosity got the better of me and I gave in and read the first book. I read the second two because I had to know what happened and to be honest it was kind of fun to read something a little sexy. <p> It should not be shocking that I purchased them on my kindle, since I already admitted to being conservative. However, I think if there was no such thing as e-readers I would have still purchased the book. I just might have resisted for a little longer. <p> Needless to say I overlooked the perceptual lip biting, and enjoyed the books for what they were - Beauty and the Beast plus sex @Seeley. <p> @Two Flights Down - I am glad you are letting Nathan post your first comment. I read it earlier and really enjoyed your point-of-view. I also felt like I learned a lot from it. I was actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it, although I tried to but could n't get past the first page. I 'm not sure why, perhaps it was because I knew something explicit and sexual was around the corner. Not a big fan of reading about it. I wonder if it is actually the dominant male women yearn for or is it the charming, understanding and fun-to-be-with, boyish male who has confidence in himself and is n't intimidated by the woman-as-goddess type of thing. Women love men who love and admire them and are, you know, interesting. But dominant, no, I think that would get wearing after awhile and result in tension, but not of the sexual kind. I think most women appreciate a male who is smarter than that. <p> Nathan, I work in an independent bookstore, and I 've been looking forward to this post ever since you announced that you were reading " that book. " As a bookseller, I witnessed firsthand how this book went from an e-book that a lot of women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and summer, with a record 98 copies sold the day before Mother 's Day. Practically everyone from ages 20 on up were asking about the book. I was surprised at how many of our longtime customers in their sixties and seventies were reading it. Sales have slacked off for the time being, but we 're still selling at least three copies a week. <p> I tried to read it, but I could n't get past chapter two. It killed me to even devote that much time to the book as there were so many other books I wanted to read. But as a bookseller, I felt like I had to find out what all the hype was about. In the end, I went to the customers and they said that " Fifty Shades of Grey " was a compelling story with fun characters, but the writing was mediocre. They also said books two and three were better than one. Most of them said that at first the books were about the sex parts, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sex parts to get to the action parts. <p> I know it would have made less money for Random, but I wish they had combined all three books and edited the crap out of them to make one well-written book. <p> Today, we received the book, " Fifty Shades of Chicken. " It 's a cookbook with a humorous story about an inexperienced chicken being dominated by a chef. I 'm not joking. We 've already sold three copies. And we 've sold a lot of other Fifty Shades parodies, too. But the best writing based on Fifty Shades has to be the Amazon reviews of the books. Those are hilarious. --Jen <p> @Mira--I did NOT say women want to be dominated. I said women are drawn to power. Look at that woman who got mixed up with David Petraeus. You think she 'd have gone for it if he 'd been a grocery clerk? Or that she fell for that cute receding hairline? She was n't attracted to his power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that power to rub off on her. It 's the primal appeal of the tribal chieftan. <p> Anne, I 'm sorry! I got confused. The comment I was responding to was Nancy Thompson 's. Sorry. <p> I agree with you, in that I think people are often attracted to someone who has what we do n't have and want. I do n't know about women in general being attracted to power, although, since they have been denied power for many centuries, that makes sense. <p> It 's a fantasy. No one really wants to be dominated or hurt in real life but it is fun to read about it and imagine what you would do in the same situation, especially given that Christian,( and Edward) is so beautiful, dreamy, athletic, not to mention rich. Plus, he is vulnerable at heart so she can fix him. We all want to fix people. <p> I thoroughly enjoyed all three books and am prepared to forgo beautiful writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excessive editing and tailoring a story to suit a publisher 's idea of what 's fun to read sometimes spoils the fun. Just saying... <p> I read 50 Shades because I enjoyed a few of the Twilight books, plus, as a writer, whenever hoards of people are reading a book and telling how great it is, I have to see what the fuss is. <p> I think it 's popular for a number of reasons : 1. The author is building off of her Twilight Fan Fiction base( as a few people have already mentioned.) 2. Far as I can tell, she 's bringing something out into the open, mainstream life, that people rarely talk about. To tell you the truth, I 'd never heard of a Dominant until I 'd read this book! Of course, I knew about BDSM, but... I think she 's bringing a " somewhat secret " lifestyle out into the open, almost saying it 's " okay " to do this. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelled to finish the first story, and then I felt compelled to read the second story. <p> Things started going flat for me after about the third or fourth chapter of the second story. I felt the second book had a VERY SAGGING MIDDLE! I was bored with 2nd book, almost did not finish it. <p> The 3rd book was not as entertaining as the first, but, not as SLOW as the second one. <p> @Mira Oh, good. I did n't want people to think I was into that sub stuff. I have a recurring character in my books who 's a dominatrix, though. : -) <p> The lure of power does work both ways. The scullery maid who ends up with the prince is one archetype( Those Regency romances are always about the girl who falls for Rakish Duke, not the Rakish Stable Boy With Great Abs.) But another archetype is La Belle Dame Sans Merci--the unattainable high-born Lady of the troubadour poets. Both archetypes live on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapped into an archetypal fantasy. It 's the fantasy, not the prose that people are attracted to. <p> I think Fifty Shades, aside from the ' billionaire guy ' fantasy many women have, hit precisely because it was raw and ' flawed ' on so many levels. <p> It was simple. Something the average person... alright in parts... can relate it. It did n't pretend to be intellectual, or a writing masterpiece. It was just a story about a girl. Believable or not in some places was irrelevant. <p> Think ' Gangnam Style ' which if I 'm not mistaken, has taken the slot for most viewed Youtube Video ever. What makes this song great? It does n't follow convention or rules... it 's just an odd dude, doing odd things and not giving a toot what anything thinks. <p> I think most of us are pretty basic creatures. And for reasons we ca n't fathom, we relate to basic things. Primal things. <p> I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why, even people who do n't read... could relate to it. E.L just told her story exactly how she envisioned it. <p> It 's sexy. Point, blank and period. I read it and I was not impressed from a prose standpoint. But I have a slew of girlfriends who for months could not do anything but quote the book lines and wonder about who is going to play Christian in the movie. And I have to admit I will go see the movie. In the age of reality tv where someone named Snookie is rich and famous, are we really surprised that this book has been so popular? <p> Here 's what I find weird : I have never heard an actual plot mentioned in relation to this book. I mean, is there a journey? A pivotal moment? What 's at stake for the main character? I keep hearing about sex, sex, sex, but nothing ever happens. <p> Logline : Girl meets hot businessman ; they go on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy that. But still, I 'm feeling mental pain over this. *hits head with Fifty Shades* <p> When I read your comment that FSOG ' gave an urbane veneer to a romance genre that very often skews rural/suburban ' I thought ' YES! '. For years now I 've been a disenfranchised chicklit reader. From once being cool stories about smart, metropolis dwelling singletons meeting &; falling in love, chicklit has descended into a twee genre about second time rounders, empty nesters &; heroines knitting their own houses. They do n't even focus on a relationship anymore - they 're all to do with setting up a business, saving a shop or a building( insert as appropriate). Yawn. It 's why I dumped chicklit, serendipitously found fanfic &; never looked back. I 'd hoped the publication of FSOG would give chicklit/romance the kick up the pants it needed, would make it flirtier, sexier, funnier and more relationship centred but alas, the sniffy, superior response of most chicklit authors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cupcakes &; knitting tea cosies. <h> Facebook : <h> Twitter <h> I 'm on Google+ <h> Tumblr too : <h> Search the blog : <p> Loading... <h> Friends of the Blog : <h> Affiliate Links <p> Links to buy books and other media and products via online vendors are affiliate links, for which I will receive an affiliate commission that goes to support the overhead associated with maintaining the blog and forums.
