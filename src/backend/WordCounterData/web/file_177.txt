5044241 <p> Is the independent vote overrated? In our latest installment looking at the exit polls from last week 's presidential election, here 's something you might not have known : Romney actually won the independent vote, 50%-45%. So now twice in the last three elections -- in 2004 and 2012 -- the winner has lost the indie vote. What does this mean? Well, party ID appears to matter much more : In 2004, it was even ; in 2008, it was D+7 ; and last week, it was D+6. Also, many polls have different ways of deciding who is an " independent " ; some pollsters include " lean Dems and lean GOPers " in their independent number which lately has given the indie number a GOP skew. If you move the leaners into their own parties, then you get a more pure indie subgroup( and you also realize how really small of a subgroup it is). <p> The day before the election Mark Halperin could n't understand how President Obama could possibly be ahead in so many swing states while losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class that 2010 " independents turned against Obama. " One could cite pundit after pundit who believed in the supremacy of independents. More Halperin on Morning Joe, in a quote blasted all over Breitbart and Drudge : <p> Even in the Michigan Q poll that shows the President leading substantially, he 's losing independents. That is the strongest argument the Romney campaign will make against all these polls that show the president up. Which is, you may be oversampling Democrats in some of these polls. If Romney 's winning independents in Ohio they think he 's gon na win. <p> Wrong. More Democratic leaning independents are proud to call themselves Democrats under the leadership of President Obama. Republicans want to be independent because the Republican brand ranks slightly below gangrene in favorability. In 2010, their independents turned out and ours did n't. This year, more of ours preferred to be called Democrat. No oversampling, just pride. <p> Nate Silver began his work here at Daily Kos. So did Sam Wang. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jed Lewison and David Nir provide some of the best political analysis in the business. Our polling is at the very top of accuracy. The number crunching of folks like dreaminonempty and MattTX provide some of the most thorough in depth electoral analysis you can find. And our guy called the election dead on. You never once heard any of that ridiculous " it 's a toss up " garbage coming from these pages. Time after time after time, we prove ourselves concise, accurate, truthful and prescient. On issue after issue, election after election, our reality has a consistent bias towards being the truth. <p> It might come as a shock to " very serious people " that I ask why it is the media pundits get so much exposure despite being consistently wrong( or far behind) about everything. Obviously, because we are just Cheeto-eating basement dwellers, we do n't deserve the spotlight. While we can not expect to get anything close to the exposure of a Mark Halperin or a Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ". A tag like " reform " alone is probably not meaningful. <p> In fact I want to see more diaries based on more in depth thought of issues rather than the many knee jerk reactions to corporate media story du jour. If we want to drive the narrative we have to stop taking so many cues from them. <p> make triple figures for spouting off nonsense. They have no desire to give respect to rabble like Daily Kos. They are income brackets and elite housing so they could n't care less about how ordinary people live. <p> the site does look pretty damn screwball when we rec up crap like this. or get all caught up in personal drama narratives, like the nephew bullshit. <p> with stuff like that being elevated to prominence, we have to expect to not be taken seriously. <p> so make up your minds, mang. you want to be like a newspaper/media? act like one. but when the rec list, being subject to the whims of member recs, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diaries, and nonsense, it hardly commands respect. <p> Please do n't dominate the rap, Jack, if you got nothin ' new to say - Grateful Dead <p> national newspapers ' websites are filled with nonsense about how COMRADE OBUMMER HAS A MUSLIM RING or whatever, and that does n't stop them from getting respect. <p> I think trained journalists are perfectly capable of drawing a distinction between front-page posters backed by the editors of Daily Kos and random people writing diaries, regardless of how many recs those diaries have. <p> The reason they refuse to draw that distinction has everything to do with the way sites like Daily Kos threaten their hegemony over journalism. It must infuriate them that we can do journalism better than they can despite having( for the most part) less experience and no formal training. <p> I 'm a biologist and so can not resist! Remoras do not suck the blood of their host ; they use the host fish as transport and feed off leftovers from its kills, and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the class osteichthyes, or the boney fish group. <p> On the other hand, a lamprey is from a far more ancient group of fishes, the agnatha. These do not have paired fins or a boney skeleton like modern fishes, but they do suck the blood of their host. <p> Remoras and their hosts host share a commensalistic relationship, wherein one species benefits but has a neutral impact on its host, whereas lampreys are parasitic of their hosts. <p> Therefore, the political class is like unto a lamprey if you are going for bloodsucking, or like a remora if eating feces is your preferred analogy. <p> fifty years ago i was smelt dipping in Lake Huron, I reached into my net and pulled out a lamprey. That was not a particularly pleasant moment, but became something i would occasionally remember, like, for instance, now. <p>... sin that pays its way can travel freely, and without a passport, whereas Virtue, if a pauper is stopped at all frontiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minutes " Sunday that Americans are turning into a collection of historical illiterates. We have an entire political party who will not submit to fact-checking and is on the record of being able to " make reality. " No wonder we are such historical illiterates when the Republicans and Fox News consistently rewrite. <p> And it feels like I 'm livin'in the wasteland of the free Iris DeMent, 1996 <p> that the past is nearly useless to them, and of little interest to them. <p> Not only that - but the only history that most Americans know is a history that is White America-friendly( and White Conquistador/Conqueror friendly). <p> PBS has contributed to the problem recently, with special series such as Niall Ferguson, which made scores of outrageous claims, such as that the North American model was " superior " to the South American of European Colonization. Wondering how the people of South America feel about that argument? Ferguson did not even mention the genocide against American Indians that lasted for 300 years, and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other American genocide/atrocities committed against millions of Africans shipped to the U.S. Where does Ferguson acknowledge the contributions of the African slaves to north america, or the debt that is owed to them? Ferguson makes it clear that, in his view, the genocides against the American Indians and the African slaves were completely justified from the standpoint of his " history. " <p> PBS also ran a lengthy " historical " program about the Russian occupation of Poland in 1939/1940 - in this program, the Soviet Union received all the blame for the suffering of the Polish people during that time - - but the program did this blaming by letting Hitler and the Nazis completely off the hook! Not only that( they included a one sentence gloss about the Nazi invasion of Poland), but they even suggested that the Nazi expansion eastward was, in effect, necessary because the Nazis felt threatened by Stalin. So this is the kind of pseudo-history that has been propounded by PBS in the past few years. <p> In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Channel finally took a break from its non-stop alligator wrestling and mud hand catfish grabbing to present an informative program about Rockefeller, Carnegie, Vanderbilt, Ford, and Morgan. It has been so ridiculous to surf the History Channel only to come across programming that has only the most extremely tangential and historically non-relevant material 99% of the time. <p> This weekend, " Lincoln " opens nationwide. It is based from a Pulitzer Prize-winning text, " Team of Rivals : The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln ", which has been massaged into a script by Tony Kushner and will star Daniel Day-Lewis. In short, Oscar bait. <p> Schoolhouse Rock did a pretty good job of presenting the extant view of history as entertainment -- just try reciting the Preamble without resorting to the song.( " Elbow Room ", the celebration and who would preserve what is good and fruitful in our national heritage.

I expect that after this election that trend will continue. <p> In the last two years, MSNBC has added Mr. Sharpton 's show at 6 p.m. and four round-table talk shows, two on weekday afternoons and two on weekend mornings. Mr. Griffin said he wanted to add more political programming on the weekends, replacing hours of prison documentaries that earn solid ratings but muddy the channel 's identity. <p> Several MSNBC employees, who spoke about programming plans on the condition of anonymity, said the most likely candidate for a new show was the Washington Post columnist Ezra Klein, a frequent substitute for Ms. Maddow. Mr. Klein may start with a weekend time slot, but these people said the 8 p.m. weekday time slot held by Mr. Schultz was also a possibility. <p> Back in the early 1970s there were serious concerns that American media was in the hands of only about 75 media outlets. <p> Now, with consolidation, there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of most of American media. <p> ACTION : Sign up for action alerts, donate money at this good organization called freepress dot net : http : //www.freepress.net/ <p> Freepress.net is a project of Free Press and the Free Press Action Fund. Free Press and the Free Press Action Fund do not support or oppose any candidate for public office. We are nonpartisan organizations advocating for universal and affordable Internet access, diverse media ownership, vibrant public media and quality journalism. <p> stiff delivery, and at breakneck speed. When he gets on with Rachel, he talks even faster, and the two of them start to see who can talk fastest while remaining intelligible. <p> One can not really imagine Klein slowing down and talking like Walter Cronkite or Dan Rather - maybe in a few decades, but not this year. He has had his moments now and then, filled in ok for Rachel, give him credit. <p> But he does not have the TV attractiveness factor, to put it mildly and gently. Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 's no looker either. But I could stand to watch James half an hour each day, and I do n't know if there is anything Ezra can really do to sharpen up - maybe grow his hair longer, a beard and big bushy mustache to give him some coverage where needed. <p> most people do n't find him physically adorable - they just do n't - and a lot have the opposite reaction. <p> Adorable as a person, maybe. Admirable, definitely. We need him, but just not on TV. <p> Hell, Ed looks ten times as good as EK - Ed 's not beautiful, but appeals to a lot of working class people, and he projects strength and info for the common people. <p> God love all the many up-and-coming millennials on MSNBC, and there seem to be dozens of them. Ezra is just one out of many. Krystal 's show has three good panelists, herself included, and Chris Hayes has proven that he has got what Rachel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has really grown up this year, while Ezra is still doing what Ezra did a year ago, little changed. You 've got a great many other millennials on MSNBC as guests, too. <p> for NBC News. David Gregory just has to be replaced, as do most of the standard crew of talking heads they have over their. If I hear once more about the Team of Rivals,. <p> And it feels like I 'm livin'in the wasteland of the free Iris DeMent, 1996 <p> The truth is that MSNBC had a ready-made audience, and a lot of ready-made talent - all the network had to do was bring them together. <p> CNN had plenty of opportunity to grab the progressive audience, but they completely muffed it, and did the worst possible thing by trying to take right wing audience from Fox, instead. <p> A classic moment from CNN 's Erin Burnett was her personal commentary, shaming the French People for having the ridiculous idea of putting more people to work by having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shameful those French people are, how lazy, that they only want to work 35 hours per week, she said, and then chuckled to herself at the pathetic fools. <p> MSNBC still broadcasts a lot of terrible " prison " programming, and some awful weekend content. When will they wake up and realize that there are a lot of other progressives that can do quality programming? <p> It would be incredibly foolish to keep Rev Al while firing Ed Schultz. The two of them produce a lot of overlapping programming, but they both proved their worth in an election year. Both programs could be cut to half an hour, but neither should be cut. Hard to understand why they broadcast Hardball at 5 and 7 pm, so close together. The midnight rebroadcasts are incredibly helpful to those who work late. <p> Chris Hayes has shown that he deserves a program, and he could handle half an hour on weekdays. A lot of the MSNBC afternoon programming tends to drift semi-aimlessly. Every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitchell is very good, but her delivery is so dry - maybe she could do the same number of minutes, but interspersed with other programming. Krystal is good, but her foursome team is so predictable, and they do n't do a good job of presenting the Democratic viewpoint. ME Cupp dominates the proceedings - what 's the point of putting a right winger on with 3 nice liberals who let her set the tone for every discussion? Send Cupp somewhere else, even as a guest commentator or panelist. <p> Ezra Klein puts up some interesting( and not so interesting) graphs, some of which are not comprehensibly designed for average viewers. <p> Ezra talks way too fast most of the time, and in a medium that values attractiveness, he can be a little hard on the eyes. He needs a complete makeover, but even that would n't make him eye-catching. <p> Ezra also goes into flights of fancy, seemingly enchanted by his own brilliance. It is " nerds on steroids " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Chris Hayes and the two of them can quickly turn into a spectacle of two geeks trying to out-geek each other, and not giving a damn about the viewing audience, except insofar as they can impress their brilliance on the befuddled viewers. <p> Sorry, but Ezra has a face for radio, not for TV. I appreciate him, and he 's done some great work, but his visual presentation is distracting in a negative way. Glad that Ezra is having so much success at the Washington Post, though! We need him in print media, and he could do well on radio, perhaps. <p> it does n't take 4 hours a day to figure out what is on this site, what is valid, etc. <p> Much of what appears here is not exactly ready for prime time. <p> I believe that if we had an edited digest that was always well done and easy to follow( like TPM and Buzzflash and Raw Story) we would get more respect for those parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a free-form website that allows everything from recipes to gardening advice to photo essays of animals and pretty scenery..... why should such a website even be on the reading list of the political class? <p> Test it for yourself. Ask a friend or relative to visit Daily Kos. Ask them to time themselves. How long does it take them to find and absorb political news that they can use? <p> It 's been awhile since I 've seen the stats( pre-version 4, I believe), but most visitors only read front page articles, and never browse the individual diaries. <p> The analysts that brooklynbadboy highlights are nearly all front pagers, or are often promoted to front page. The bathwater that you cite are the diaries that receive far less attention. <p> Speaking for myself, I scroll through the front page articles first, and then read the diaries as time permits. The same analogy applies to a newspaper--do n't most people review the front page before they turn to other stories?( Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc.) <p> The first thing a lot of people see on the right hand side is the Community Spotlight. I have n't clicked on a single one of those diaries in the past three months. They all look like kossacks talking to each other about trivial things, and some even feature " woozels " and " puppies " in their titles. It looks amateurish. I would drop it entirely, or put it on a linked page that does n't draw much attention. <p> The " Recommended " Diaries should be right up at the top, where it used to be. <p> And there should be a longer list of " Recommended Diaries " such as 20. <p> The Diaries page should have the featured stories more strongly featured - putting the " recent diaries " on the right side of the Diaries page, so that Recommended Diaries take up the bulk of the Diaries page. <p> been on the spotlight a few times and I have never spoken about pooties..

It went on for days in several different diaries, discussing the need for the large risk insurance and re-insurance that AIG provides, credit default swaps, the precariously stacked global market, the bail-outs of the brokerage firms, and of course, the effect on the deficit. This occurred in fall 2008. <p> I do n't recall that sort of conversation happening anywhere else. There were a few good articles in print media. But a conversation? No. Everyone just lined up pro or against. <p> Even now, except for Game Change and a documentary or two, AIG has never been discussed so the average American understands how close to the cliff we were and can decide for himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of folks here suggested then). <p> And here we are. Has anything changed? Or are pundits from CNBC to PBS to Fox just creating a whole lot of fury, signifying nothing? <p> I definitely understand the need to vent and rant on occasion, and do n't hold that against anyone. <p> But, yes, so much of the language here does indeed come across as completely gratuitous -- like people trying to sound like part of the Kool Kids Klub. It reminds me of nothing so much as the freshman I would see year after year in college who would suddenly all take up smoking in order to seem " mature " and " sophisticated.

We are a threat to the punditocracy 's status and position. The more we prove that they know less than those who are not given their exalted position by the corporate media the more precarious their position gets. We will never have their respect. However we will have the last laugh, as most of them are dependent on types of media that are increasingly becoming irrelevant. <p> If there is no accountability for those who authorized torture, we can no longer say that we are a nation of laws, not men. <p> How about ignoring them.

IGNORE. They never were relevant, and they never will be. Who cares how much $$ they make. IGNORE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polling firms, I have calculated the average error and the average statistical bias in the margin it reported between President Obama and Mitt Romney, as compared against the actual results nationally or in one state. <p> For instance, a polling firm that had Mr. Obama ahead by two points in Colorado -- a state that Mr. Obama actually won by about five points -- would have had a three-point error for that state. It also would have had a three-point statistical bias toward Republicans there. <p> There are still some states that are counting, so the numbers might change a smidge, but basically the accuracy came down to how much pollster 's had a republican bias, and interestingly, PPP had a fairly large R bias of 1.6%. So, as more numbers come in, its likely that PPP will look slightly worse. <p> " Empty vessels make the loudest sound, they have the least wit and are the greatest blabbers " Plato <p> Nate compared the last 3 weeks of polling to the actual results. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing outfits( e.g., Rasmussen and Gallup) who shift their numbers in the last week to game their accuracy score. The key is, he does it for everybody. <p> That could partially explain why almost everybody had a R bias in his analysis, cause Obama really did increase his polling in the last few weeks. But again, no single outfit 's error was hurt or helped by this, since all were evaluated in the same way. <p> " Empty vessels make the loudest sound, they have the least wit and are the greatest blabbers " Plato <p> Daily Kos will get respect when it actually implements a real 50-state strategy instead of a 29-state strategy only spotlighting a hand-picked crop of candidates that meets some sort of arbitrary( and not weighted) " purity " test. <p> Also kos missed the boat on Joe Donnelly and Heidi Heitkamp and the media remembers his Jon Tester temper tantrum. <p> You see, when Daily Kos can point to results that it made happen, then it shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserve recognition for being able to say what was really happening. <p> of others becoming too blue dogish. Kos got burned out on urging money for those folks, and decided we should pick our spots to elect mostly the more progressive candidates. <p> Not sure how much that really influences the MSM. Primarily we do n't get respect because the Very Serious People are idiots. Daily Kos is n't Huffpo or a straight news organization. But then look at Politico or Newsmax, they get more respect than Daily Kos, even though their content tends to be quite slanted. <p> down pat. If all we are talking about is how DK understands what happened than the Beltway media, then DK ought to get its due respect from them as being more accurate than them. <p> But I want DK to have more influence.

We need to build the party everywhere even in red states( 50 state strategy) and we need to remember that this 2012 presidential election was won largely by careful, realistic targeting of a few states. They are actually two separate activities. The presidential campaign had to focus on swing states and they did a damn fine job of it. The rest of us need to focus on building the party and presenting an alternative even in the heart of redstate america.( And the rest of us need to ruthlessly purge corrupt democrats especially in deep-blue places like the laws of nature, but by our institutions, great is our sin.

The media tradition that Rupert Murdoch comes out of is the highly partisan Australian newspaper tradition. Where they not only take stands but lead public movements. Murdoch led the same kind of effort in the UK with those newspapers. American media( newspapers) used to do this to. But radio and TV were off limits to this kind of thing. And as fewer Americans read newspapers the support for campaigning newspapers dwindled. <p> We campaign. We are partisan. And we are not required to support every Democrat.

" THIS is what Democrats stand for. This is why( even outside of Indiana) you should be pulling the lever for DEMOCRATS.

Therefore, this is where I go for news. <p>... are n't going to respect DK. I listened a bit to post-election analysis and it was all about " what President Obama needs to do is... ". Not one pundit offered much in what the losing side needed to do including supposedly lib-leaners such as Dee Dee Meyers. <p> They will never acknowledge that a site they consider fringe offers better insight. They are scared of Republican backlash so they will continue to concern troll the Democratic Party. <p> " There is nothing more dreadful than the habit of doubt. Doubt separates people. It is a poison that disintegrates friendships and breaks up pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is a sword that kills. ".. Buddha <p> do independent " analysis ". Folks like Halperin, do independent " stenography ". The issue is they pretend it is analysis, and are in just as much a bubble as conservatives. Here, Front Pagers disagree often on major policy issues, which makes for a more robust discussion. In Washington, the so-called journalists rarely disagree or have the ideas questioned. Ca n't rock that boat... otherwise you may lose access. Which to me is the root cause. <p> Access. You guys are n't fighting for it. Therefore, you are not worried about appeasing the people that allow you to pay your bills. <p> get the exposure, but we 'll never get the paychecks. And that, I think is the answer to your question. Market logic says that these very serious people deserve the exposure because they are " professionals ", after all they make the big bucks. And folks who make big bucks are by market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market logic, but that 's a different diary). <p> Because folks at daily kos do it for a scant fraction of what the commercial media pays these so-called pundit experts, the commercial media is never going to take seriously anyone who offers his or her expertise for nothing, or a nominal salary. <p> The fact that some of the very excellent data diving and writing came from folks who were n't even on the payroll( hi MattTX) only serves to baffle them. " Amateurs " ca n't get things right. The <p> Words can sometimes, in moments of grace, attain the quality of deeds. --Elie Wiesel <p> which have gone through the roof lately... I shudder to think what the traffic on here would be if we had all this and mainstream respect too! <p> Let ' em snicker and snark if they want to. The proof of the pudding is in the eating and ours is tasting quite good lately. Victories at every level, and our accuracy on the 2012 election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from our highest recommended diarists, and from our alumnus and crossover-hit superstar Nate Silver) was just excellent, highly commendable. <p> because pundits were far more silly-season than many FP'ers at the DK. <p> But the comment threads. And some of the diaries. Oi vey, it may be hard for some casual visitors to weed out what 's what? Thus maybe it 's hard for some to take this site seriously. Just a thought. Based mainly on comments from friends who no longer participate here. <p> Thus said, I would n't really change much( with a few minor exceptions). <p> and high barriers for disbarment, the conversations, commentary, and analysis are always going to contain some crazy stuff. Some of the crazy is clearly malicious( right wing trolls), but most of the crazy is simply... crazy. <p> DKos is and always has been, imo, open source democracy at its finest. I 'm torn by BBB 's desire for DKos to get the acknowledgement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping things a bit tight and " in the family ", so to speak. It 's kinda like that great rock band you discovered, and though you want the band to get superstar famous, you still want to feel like the band is your own because you discovered them first. Does that make sense? <p> " Mitt who? That 's an odd name. Like an oven mitt, you mean? Oh, yeah, I 've got one of those. Used it at the Atlas Society BBQ last summer when I was flipping ribs. " <p> we are respected. Think about it. Not only does MSM refer to this site either for or against but look who joins and posts wanting our help. We deliver best we can. The membership has Barack Obama, Elizabeth Warren, Al Frankin, Alan Grayson, Barbara Lee,..... and others. I would say that is a great deal of respect no matter what one thinks. <p> We raise money. We are all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground and back to the site reporting. Netroots Nation... and really Grass Roots. Some people just do n't acknowledge how influential this site is. Pretty darn telling when candidates want our opinions. Again, do it! Be part of helping us build a veteran community online. United Veterans of America <p> Long before I registered here, I used to visit and read the front page and once in a while a diary. But I rarely read any comments. The default comment setting was SHRINK( or its equivalent in those days), so I usually only saw the subject line. <p> outside of the " liberal blogosphere " is when they 're looking for examples of lefties who hate Obama. They pick the one or two whinging diaries out of 1000 and say " Here! Look! The left hates Obama too! " even when it 's only a handful of perennially-dissatisfied individuals. <p> If ever big dollops of schadenfreude were justified it would be from the Democratic side post election day. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right and then weeks of media complicity in a false election narrative, the rewards go to those who kept their heads on, studied the smart numbers, and were n't at all surprised that Obama won as big as he did. <p> And one of those rewards is knowing we were right, they were wrong. Not just about the presidential election, but about who America is and what it wants. <p> IMO, schadenfreude is a perfectly civil response when of American politics is the avoidance of saying anything real on real issues. " Theodore Roosevelt. <p> What you and those below you are saying is that the Trad Med uses us to support whatever bullshit hypothesis they have cooked up. Because we are so open source you can always find one or two posters that will support whatever crap they want to write. <p> that 's one thing, if it 's someone who never or almost never gets rec 'd and gets excited... why not? <p> IMO a bigger threat is diaries that get rec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that made it up the list to the top claiming Romney paid zero taxes since ' 96. The diarist HRd anyone who questioned and still people kept up the recs. <p> In the end the diarist 's tip jar had at least 80 HRs and over 300 recs and people did n't even stop to question why? Why would there be so many HRs? Could there be more to it than wish fulfillment? The diary said something that people wanted to be true, it was n't supported by facts. This one <p> " The scientific nature of the ordinary man is to go on out and do the best you can. " John Prine <p> You are assuming the political class would be attracted to people who get things right. <p> Your assumption would be wrong. <p> If you are intoxicated on your own narcissism &; ignorance, &; the media establishment is likewise intoxicated on your narcissism &; ignorance, what the hell use do you have for Nate Silver &; Markos Moulitsas? <p> You seem to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhinged buffoons is a wrong they want to right. <p> If you read anything in the mainstream media and than click comments you usually get unrestrained right wing bile. Probably because there is next to no moderation on most of those sites. I do not blame them for not replying to the comments they get with little to no quality control. <p> " Independent " voters are too heterogeneous to really read. I am an independent, but I also consider myself progressive on a lot of issues. Regardless, I will never align with a specific party nor will I relinquish or compromise my right to evaluate every race and every candidate on his/her own merits, not party affiliation. <p> As an independent, I, as a pro-choice, pro-marriage-equality, pro-science, anti-war, pro-voting Keynesian, get lumped into " independents " with tea partiers who feel that the GOP is n't conservative enough for them anymore since George Bush went on a drunken spending spree. With that much ideological variance, it is nearly impossible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " will vote as a group. <p> the Brightest " that I learned is, the money and success goes to the people who tell you what you want to hear. The people with the knowledge, facts and figures, and analysis skills stay in the basement. We love you guys, but better get a dehumidifier. <p> Organizing and changing has never been a mainstream activity. The day we are part of the mainstream is the day I leave TDK. Grassroots democracy is not about institutional acceptance. It 's about agitation for change and improvement against those interests that are just as happy keeping things the way they are. It 's progress, it 's the future, and it 's the American way. But it 's never popular with the comfortable class. <p> Some people are intolerant, and I CA N'T STAND people like that. -- Tom Lehrer <p> Yes I used to watch Fox, I wrote a Diary about it http : //www.dailykos.com/... O'Reilly constantly referred to D/Kos as the looney lefties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come over and have a peek, and I 've never looked back. I think D/Kos has gained plenty of credibility over the last 4 years. A lot of the writing here is first class, and opinions here are not presented as facts. Polling, well since Kos dumped the clowns that were being used a few years ago, D/Kos has the most accurate polls in the country. I 'll stand corrected if I 'm wrong on this, but I believe I am indeed right on this. To the Beltway and their brethren, ignore D/kos at your own peril. I think they are starting to understand this. <p> Well, actually I heard Jon Stewart making fun of Bill O'Reilly about DailyKos, and so I came over to look. And read the funniest thing I had ever seen on the internet : Hunter 's Please Bill O Reilly Have Mercy. <p> I still love that diary. And it 's fun to see the old-timers in the comments. <p> I am not part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I am in the process of publishing a book about ways that we can improve our political and economic institutions. As part of this I offer my readers, if I should ever have any, a comparison between Daily Kos, Paul Krugman 's blog, the blog of Thomas Burke of Swarthmore, and a blog called New Economic Perspectives. These four blogs serve different purposes and have different pros and cons. I discuss them as possible models for implementing blogs that will serve a variety of public purposes. Daily Kos could well serve as a national model for a key system that would turn our political discourse in a positive direction. A few changes here and there, a wise selection of a support staff to enforce the rules, and it could change our national discussions from personalities to purposes. In other words Daily Kos, slightly altered, could help the nation get things done. <p> I am not saying that Daily Kos has not served an important purpose so far. It has, and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am primarily speaking about its design as a gateway system for purposeful communications among millions of people. <p> It is a good thing, and I have enjoyed watching it evolve over the years. Whoever guided this evolution was applying Evolution by Cogitation, not Evolution by Natural Selection. Evolution by Cogitation has several defining characteristics, and among the most important are four eternal questions that any efficient process must answer : Where do we stand? How did we get here? Where do we want to go? How do we get there from here? Life at Daily Kos, from my standpoint as a systems designer, has been engrossing as these questions have been, and are being, answered. <p> The media is fundamentally about selling commercial space and doing what is necessary to make profit. <p> Repeat as often as needed for this to sink in. <p> Write it on the blackboard a hundred times. <p> The only thing that gets respect in this world is big money that is tied into promoting consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that climate change is not a media-genic issue? It is because the cure is to look at reduced consumerism and resource consumption. That goes totally against the whole reason for the existence of the media. <p> Anything that might go against the interests of what funds media can not get respect in that arena. <p> What does it take to get this across? <p> hope that the idiots who have no constructive and creative solutions but only look to tear down will not win the day. <p> I do n't worry what the punditz 's and the Vewwy Sewious Peepul think... they were caught flat-footed this time. Daily Kos is more valuable than a lot of sites because it is reality-based. A lot of the MSM is what you might call spin-based, which means they have a slant when they 're pretending they do n't. That 's dangerous territory. At least here, we are honest and open that we are progressive. <p> The political reality is against them. DK wo n't get any respect until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least another hundred years we must pretend to ourselves and to everyone that fair is foul and foul is fair ; for foul is useful and fair is not. Avarice and usury and precaution must be our gods for a little longer still. --John Maynard Keynes <p>... the Beltway mind. They have a suffocatingly narrow view of events that is self-reinforcing. In that regard, they act much like the Romney campaign team that, apparently, truly believed that the vast majority of public polls were skewed. <p> Idiots, all. <p> Listening to Halperin blather on in that clip is the perfect example of the shallow thinking that permeates the Beltway pundit class. It does n't even occur to him that both things can be true : <p> 1. Romney was winning voters who self-identify as " independents. " <p> and <p> 2. Romney was losing because there were more Democrats and independents voting for Obama than Republicans and independents voting for Romney. <p> In Halperin 's tiny, little mind, there were 42% Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!) and 16% independents. And since Mitt was winning more independents, Mitt had to be winning! Because, of course, the polls were skewed too Democratic! <p> Just look how ignorant, shallow, stupid and divorced from reality that thinking is. <p> Halperin, Todd and the rest of them are about as deep as a puddle of spit. <p> How on earth Mark Halprin and the Politico hacks get so much attention for essentially reciting what they last read on their buddies ' twitter feed is a mystery. When it comes to objective political analysis, I 'll take Dworkin, Kos, and Josh Marshall anytime. <p> One of the diaries here recently highlighted the reactions of some of the far righties during the election. One fellow, DuJan, took it upon himself to watch msnbc for everyone else that day, because he was planning to gloat. <p> He made petty insults( some were actually clever) about the personalitiies, he re-interpreted information - for example, Romney 's not writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag, while all the talk about voter suppression and potential fraud was setting us up for an excuse if we lost. <p> Everyone else thanked him for his sacrifice in watching msnbc. <p> And... in many ways it did not feel different from what we do here. Like calling Romney a dick( and I think he is). Emotionally, at least, the left and the right will feel the same. <p> Of course, our information was accurate in the end, but many people do n't or ca n't see that. They just see the emotional stuff, which is much easier to read. <p> and do n't vote. Politics literally does n't register on their mental map. Indies who do vote and are politically engaged usually lean one way or another, but whether out of vanity or dissatisfaction refuse to official align themselves with a party. <p> Personally, while I can see how people too far to the right of the GOP or left of the Democratic party might not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indies. Most are clearly leaners, so why not just pick a side and fall in with it. You can always vote for the. <p> " Liberty without virtue would be no blessing to us " - Benjamin Rush, 1777 <p> Why? Amateurs. Do n't get paid a dime, and whup the paid journalists and paid chatters every single time, on breadth of knowledge, diversity, prudence of forecasts, boots on the ground, fingers in the community, and general talent. <p> They hate us. We 'll range/ and the machinery for change/ and it 's here they got the spiritual thirst. --Leonard Cohen <p> any honest and objective analysis can point to this community as a beacon of reality, one which also encourages vigorous debates, even dissent, but which in the final outcome, continues to show the way to the truth, the reality. And reality and the facts will always result in earned respect, in the " opinion of the facts ". <p> democrats apply reasoning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply " brute " force. <p> You 'll behave, and write, professionally. You 'll hire a couple of good copy writers, ones who can instinctively spot subject-verb disagreement, to check front-page articles. You 'll set a different example for other authors on the site. <p> It is n't enough to be right. Gutter language makes it easy to dismiss an otherwise persuasive or challenging argument. <p> if they respect me? Chuck Todd is a hack, who trots out his silly board to chart out different ' paths to the WH ' every four years, trying to make flailing candidates like McCain or Romney seem relevant even when they 've been losing the entire race. <p> Mark Halperin is even more useless, but also emblematic of a plethora of pundits who never have anything meaningful to add to any conversation, but only parrot talking points they 've been handed. They do n't do any real research or analysis, never actually dig into the background of any numbers they 've been handed, to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own meanings and proclaim them ' truth '. <p> Sadly, as long as ' news ' continues to be viewed as ' infotainment ' in most media empires, we 'll be stuck with this sort of nonsense. <p> MSNBC is partisan. Fox is Partisan. CNN is even partisan in a subtler way. Not to mention the Very Serious Pundits mentioned above. DKos is a wealth of information that happens to also feature " feel-good " pieces and pootie diaries at times. There is nothing like it. <p> Stay fired up : now is the time to focus on downticket change! #Forward <p> In fact, among the Very Serious People, being right is a serious faux pas. <p> Perhaps that 's because it involves actually paying attention to facts and the real world, doing math, instead of rehashing the conventional wisdom. Being right means contradicting the Very Serious People all too often, and they do n't like that. <p> " No special skill, no standard attitude, no technology, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safely replace thought itself.

But if you are waiting and holding your breath for Traditional Media to recognize that fact... plus the fact that WE INFLUENCE PEOPLE 'S OPINIONS, AND PEOPLE 'S VOTES, AND ELECTIONS, you 'll explode your own head. To recognize our contributions and total Force would be to jeopardize their own elite status in the village and their overblown vision of themselves as opinion-makers. <p> We are the new Opinion-Makers, the new Movers &; Shakers. We are at the Gates, hell, we 've climbed the gates and are inside, doing what we do brilliantly.... influencing opinions, influencing the policy-makers.

Consider : the clowns of the Mainstream Media Village seem to " respect " people like Paul Ryan and John McCain ; people who have a reputation for " straight talk " while delivering an elite-friendly message. While the list of people they have very much disrespected include Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and pretty much every other liberal and Democratic leader. So why is it we are craving their respect anyway? <p> Fuck ' em. O Lord, let our political enemies continue to ignore all facts that are inconvenient to them, and all purveyors of such facts, so that they may remain ignorant and deluded and easy to defeat, amen. <p> I 'd hazard a guess that Kos would n't want their respect under those circumstances. Would any of the rest of us? Unless the respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose.... Oh. heh. <p> are n't we the punk rockers to the msm corporate rock? is n't the point of daily kos and other lefty blogs to provide an alternative to msm? Why should we even look for acceptance when we do n't respect them or what drivel they spew? Until and unless we 're able to deconstruct the media consolidation that has taken over this country, they 're never going to be into us. <p> " Let us never forget that doing the impossible is the history of this nation.... It 's how we are as Americans... It 's how this country was built " - Michelle Obama <p> We made a huge difference this time around. Look at all the progressives now in Washington. That was us. Look at Nat Silver 's success. That was us. Look at how much money and time we gave. That was us. Need I say : ELIZABETH WARREN?!?! That was soooooooo us. <p> If the problem is with talking heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join that crowd? Let them come to us. Let them join us and have their blinders removed. Let them see what we can do... what THEY can do, which is MUCH MUCH more than what the talking heads and pundits do. <p> And if the time does come when we have that so-called " respect, " let it be on OUR terms not on anyone else 's in mainstream media( which has failed us.) <p> Nothing looks or feels as important as the old order just before it falls into decline and disfavor because it rejected the future. The most powerful and efficient steam locomotives were designed and built just a few years before diesels rose to prominence and banished them from the scene. IBM once ruled the computer world. TV/cable/networks are hollowed-out structures ; they are inflexible, dogmatic, doomed. As are magazines and newspapers -- all media entrenched in the 20th century way of communicating from a central core, expensively financed, with heirarchies and formal channels and proscribed ways of doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no match for the rapid universal connections of the internet world, no match in any way. They are using torches to see with and horses to move themselves. Once they fall, it will take a long long time for the internet to be reduced to the same ossified operations they are, simply because no one yet alive has figured out how to master or tame the web. <p> Get respect, because they feed the corporate media 's demand for ' horserace ' journalism, because if a political race is n't ' neck and neck ' and ca n't be talked about like a sports game that has viewers on the edge of their seats, the media does n't fucking care. <p> Daily Kos analysts have called the elections for what they are. In 2008 and 2012, they were overwhelming Democratic wins, by and large. In 2010, it was a Republican backlash that we saw coming. <p> If the corporate media ca n't have a bunch of wankers on TV, endlessly circle-jerking each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Independent Voters " and other bullshit that most low-information voters associate with bipartisanship or some other quaff... yeah. <p> Maybe after the Kossacks effectively call 2014, 2016, and 2018, maybe by 2020 the hacktastic media might get a damn clue. <p> The only one in the media who told the facts at 8pm was KO, the show was well thought out and look what happened to him. Although Dbag Scarredass still has a Morning Smoe Show. Also I believe Markos is still banned from MSNBC, I would wear that as a badge of honor!!! So with all do respect BBB Fuck Them All!!!! <p> Look, DK has some good stuff, but take a gander over on that right hand column, and truth be told not everything on the front page is stellar.

The answer is that it never will. After all, very few progressives appear on Sunday shows while scores of conservatives and conservative Democrats are booked on these shows week after week. <p> and it is precisely why I do not watch any of the establishment scoundrel-pundits - even the ones on MSNBC. I might just as well watch Trump beshit himself with his idiocy. Andrea Mitchell, in particular, is an embarrassment. <p> decided to call itself the " Independent Republican " Party. Brand loyalty had its limits when Nixon tanked. Maybe something similar is happening today, nationwide, under the fig leaf of the " independent " label. <p> The civil rights, gay rights and women 's movements, designed to allow others to reach for power previously grasped only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outlines of 21st century America have emerged. -- Paul West of LA Times <p> There are plenty of people who pay attention to Daily Kos. They respect Daily Kos. Among politicians, there are people like Alan Grayson, Bernie Sanders, Darcy Burner, Al Franken, and so on who have written diaries here. Or they have quoted stories from Daily Kos. Or they have interns and assistants that follow DKos. Early in his career, President Obama was actually a member here. <p> Maybe you 're looking at pundits( the talking heads who appear on TV or write for newspapers or magazines). Well, what about Rachel Maddow or Ed Schultz or Jon Stewart? I ca n't count the number of times that I 've seen a story on their shows that I heard about 24 hours earlier right here. I know they 're paying attention to DKos. Even people like Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter mention Daily Kos once in a while( in a negative way, of course, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @). <p> And Nate Silver, the political-prediction golden boy of the 2012 election, because he called all 50 states correctly( or was it 49 of 50?). He works for the NY Times now. But he started out on Daily Kos. <p> -- <p> On the other question( about Independent voters) : <p> I think some pundits assumed that some people are Democrats, some are Republicans, and some are Independents( in between) and that the percentages are mostly fixed. People do n't change their affiliation lightly. <p> But what happened in 2012 is that some( former) Independents switched to calling themselves Democrats. And some( former) Republicans switched to Independent. Republicans switched because the Republican primary campaign rhetoric was so repugnant -- to women, to Hispanics, to LGBT people, to educated people who believe in science, to non-rich people, and to others, that they did n't want to be associated with the Republican brand. <p> -- <p> Two things happened : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the Republicans said, " No no no, there are n't that many Democrats in the country. We must unskew the polls based on what we saw in 2010 or 2006 or 2004. " So they adjusted the polls to fit their mistaken world-view of how they thought the electorate 's demographics might be in 2012. 2. At the same time some( former) Republicans started to identify as Independents. However, these people were still planning to vote for Romney. The Republicans said, " Yes yes yes! We 're winning the independent vote! That gives us the election! Because the independent voters decide the election. " They did n't realize that the number of Republicans was going down. <p> -- <p> I think there were several other factors that helped Obama beat Romney. <p>? There are evangelical Christians who believe that Mormons are n't real Christians.? There are libertarians who were pissed off that Ron Paul did n't get to speak at the RNC and voted for what 's his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd love to vote for the Republican guy, but he was just too rich and too unsympathetic.? Romney made a lot of flubs and said impolitic things( like the 47% comment or " corporations are people my friend " or the donuts-from-7-11 or plastic garbage bag raincoats at a NASCAR race or trees being the right size in Michigan or learning to say " yall " and eating grits in the south or any number of any other things). He could n't open his mouth without screwing things up.? Obama had a good Get-Out-The-Vote organization. Romney had " orca, " a smart-phone application that was n't tested and, in retrospect, was pathetically inadequate. <p> And that 's my opinion. <p> But the angle said to them, " Do not be Alfred. A sailor has been born to you " <p> This is what Charlie Rose laughed about when referring to a negative review on some gasp blog. Apparently he believes only his chattering class of TV personalities, like Halperin, and regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " legitimate " view points and analysis. to him, everyone else is just an ignorant fool to be scoffed out. But now that they 've been exposed for the meme spinners that caused GOP supporters to falsely believe Romney would win, people should laugh at anything those in the glass towers say with a hearty " consider the source.

I think we 're pretty classy and complete on our own. <p> I do n't need a riff-raff questioning whether this diary or that has denigrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( no particular slam intended, could be anyone) adding some " did Daily Kos get it right today?!?

Not at all, sir. To your point specifically, we know what we know( sometimes forged through arduous debate, painstaking cross-poll analysis, etc.), and I do n't mind at all living in the confidence that across our spectrum of differences we 're all unified in... well as laureate Ray Davies would say it better than I ever could <p> I 've just got to be free And it wo n't be long ' cos we 're right And they are wrong We 've got to get out of this world somehow We 've got to be free we 've got to be free now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including Chuck Todd who I still like a lot btw) can choose to sign onto that anytime they choose. I 'm pretty comfortable living it in this community until then, if that day ever comes. <p> For several election cycles. Just to give you the mindset of some of us, as I 'd talked to others who felt like I did, for many of us it was because we had bought the argument that both parties were really the same. <p> So we treated the decision of who to vote for in presidential elections as an evaluation of the individual candidates--which one seemed smarter, more likely to do the right things for whatever we considered the most important issues, the biggest problems. I voted for John Anderson in my first election as a voter, in 1980. Other years I sometimes voted for a Dem and other times a Rep. <p> It was n't until Bush was in office after Clinton 's two terms that it hit me that, hey! It really WAS making a difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing after the next that horrified me. He soured me so badly on Republicans that I decided that I would never vote for one again. So I voted for Kerry but still did n't change my voter registration and remained an Independent, even though I 'd decided I was voting a straight Democratic ticket from that point on. <p> I actually liked being an Independent, as it gave me a feeling of autonomy, so I would n't have changed my registration until I discovered that I could n't vote in the 2008 primary because I did n't have a party affiliation. So I finally joined the Democratic Party at that point, even though I was already firmly in the Dem camp for two election cycles while an " Independent. " <p> Still voted straight Democratic tho. Switched over in 08 on the last day so I could vote for Obama in the PA primary. Frankly, it was such a pain in the ass to find that obscure state office, I would n't change it back if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't get respect from the media, but that I think boils down to the fact that they are being paid whereas we are not. If they gave us too much credibility, then they would call into question why they are even being paid, especially in many cases because their writing and research are so inferior to what appears here. So it benefits them to look down their noses at Daily Kos. <p> On the other hand, we have many politicians and candidates and notables post here, who DO seem to have quite a bit of respect for DKos. Now if only the president would read some of the front-paged and recommended diaries and take what they say to heart! <p> But, the mainstream media has a money-guzzling advertising monster to feed. And that process goes a lot smoother for the media when politicians believe there are millions of low-information, non-partisans just waiting to be mobilized by the right ad buy. <p> This place has some good stuff, but lots of inaccurate/misleading diaries like recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on the Recommended List. That is why this place does n't get more respect. A lot of bad info
