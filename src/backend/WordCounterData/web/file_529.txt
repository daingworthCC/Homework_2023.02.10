5079841 <p> Igot a call from Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich the other day. The first thing I said to him was, " You know, this call is probably being taped. " <p> Blagojevich said he had read my column in The Chronicle last week, in which I raised questions about the " pay to play " charges being leveled against him in connection with his pending appointment of someone to fill Barack Obama 's now-empty U.S. Senate seat. <p> I think he liked how I raised questions about the timing and manner of U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald ' s decision to charge him over what appears to be little more than loose conversations he had with his staff. <p> He laughed, we talked, and all in all he seemed in pretty good spirits for a guy looking at federal charges. <p> I would n't bet on him stepping aside anytime soon. If anything, his hand is getting stronger by the day. <p> I ca n't go into details, but my impression is that the whole mess started because the governor had been considering appointing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate so she would n't be able to run against him when he went up for re-election in 2010. <p> Apparently, Obama 's people were n't happy about the idea of Madigan coming to Washington, and there were some pretty heated conversations between Blagojevich and Obama chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, which I understand will burn your ears off. <p> It was pretty clear that Blagojevich is going to hang tough, especially after the Illinois Supreme Court shot down Madigan 's request that he be forced from office because he supposedly ca n't carry out his duties. <p> It is also pretty clear that despite all the screaming over his appearing to be " selling " the seat in return for political favors or financial considerations, his fellow Democrats are not going to strip him of his power to appoint someone to replace Obama. <p> Publicly, they may say that 's because a special election would cost the state millions. But the truth is, the Democrats are deathly afraid that with all these corruption stories swirling around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democrats ' chances of holding a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. <p> And you know what? They 're probably right to be afraid. If there was a fight, the only way the Democrats could hold onto the seat would be to have Obama himself come in and campaign. <p> That, however, would make it a referendum on him - and Obama would not want to put himself in that position so early in his presidency, even in his home state. <p> I know Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said after the " pay to play " stories hit the press that he would n't seat anyone appointed by Blagojevich. <p> Of course, if that does n't fly, Blagojevich could always call Caroline Kennedy and tell her, " If New York does n't work out, we got a seat for you right here. " <p> I went to the party of the year Wednesday night. It was thrown by Emirates Airlines, and did they ever put on a show. <p> It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mason. They had about 500 people. <p> They made up the place as if you were in the first-class section of their best aircraft. All red. <p> All these attractive, tall, model-like airline attendants were around with their helpers. And their helpers were nattily dressed guys with white tops and black pants - with tray after tray of anything you wanted to drink. <p> Then a curtain opened up and you went into this dining room with huge screens all around on which they projected the story of Dubai. <p> Then out came the Irish river dancers and the Brazilian dancers. At the end, Swank invited everyone to come up and dance. And for an hour, Sheryl Crow performed and nobody, but nobody, left the dance floor. <p> Ordinarily, people at these events eat and run. But this time everybody stayed, because the door prizes were two first-class tickets and four days in Dubai - but you had to be there to win. <p> Ran into Quincy Jones the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and I caught up with him at 1300 on Fillmore for supper. <p> Quincy had just been inducted into the California Hall of Fame. He was talking about Barack Obama ' s inaugural. And like everybody else, he was trying to figure out how to get on the stage at the official inaugural ball. <p> I told him, direct the band for Aretha Franklin and you 'll be right up there. <p> As I was leaving, this brother comes up and says to me, " Willie Brown, even with the housing market and the economy, this has been a really great year for black people. " <p> " Why? " I asked. <p> " Because we got Obama. " <p> Then he said, " But you know, come to think of it, it was a + <p> a <p> $15 <p> gift card <p> Mon-Sun + <p> a <p> $25 <p> gift card <p> Illinois governor seems to be growing stronger <p> Blagojevich said he had read my column in The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " pay to play " charges being leveled against him in connection with his pending appointment of someone to fill Barack Obama 's now-empty U.S.
