5250741 <p> November is a busy month for the family. Farm auctions and the annual Helping Hand Oyster Supper take up much of Grandma 's time. The oyster supper was the most important fundraiser for the Butler Union Church. <p> Of national interest is the election of Franklin Roosevelt for an unprecedented fourth term. Grandma 's feelings probably reflect the sentiment of many voters in 1944. Sadly we are reminded the war is not yet over ; another young soldier is reported missing. <p> Wednesday, Nov. 1, 1944 : This is Arthur Hayes sale day. Dad went to Hillsboro on federal loan business. I started to walk to the sale, but Jess Masters ' family let me ride with them. A balmy day with a strong wind from the south. I bought one chicken feeder. The others went too high for me. We got seven tons of coal. K.D. Burris ' men put it in the coal house. Had an early supper and drove to Morrisonville to see Ella Graves -- the stepdaughter of Henry Best from McPherson, KS. She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, 1944 : This is Household Science day at Ida Brown 's. It is Fern Turner 's meeting. A very nice day. I took Irene Eckhoff to her corner and Mayme Ware to her gate.

I got some cuttings for some pretty chrysanthemums. I wonder will they grow. Returned Mrs. Young 's finished flower garden quilt top Mrs. George Ware. <p> Friday, Nov. 3, 1944 : Weather still continues very nice. Carl wanted to go to Litchfield to buy overshoes, so I went along. He did n't find any. I bought unbleached muslin, enough to make drapes for the living room windows. I picked enough ripe tomatoes to make catsup. Carl and John Keith had a settlement for the year. He paid John $115combining, etc. <p> Saturday, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an early dinner, so we could go to Frank Reike conservator sale. Said sale was held where Merle now lives.

Carl got two wrenches and a.50 cross cut saw. Weather is getting cooler. <p> Sunday, Nov. 5, 1944 : We went to Sunday School. Ate a lunch and I then dressed a chicken to fry. Merle 's came for supper. We had gingerbread with whipped cream on it. Carole Sue has a new brown check snow suit and hat. She and I waved a flag and I sang, " It 's My Flag Too. " She tried to sing it too. She played a long time with some corn meal and a spoon and two measuring cups. She is a very busy child. <p> Monday, Nov. 6, 1944 : Rainy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring hogs. They finally got it done. I made 13 small pints of cocktail of pears, peaches, pineapple and maraschino cherries. Three jars of apple butter, and cooked tomatoes for catsup. I dug most of my gladiolas. Went to Mrs. Hayes for some coleus cuttings that Mary Burris brought there for me. <p> Tuesday, Nov. 7, 1944 : Election day. National. Roosevelt is running for a fourth term. It is too long in my opinion for one man to hold that office. But it is a bad time for a new man to try to step into such a turmoil, so I voted for him again. Four years ago it was bad, but now the job is still more complicated. Roosevelt seems to be winning. No rain. <p> Thursday, Nov. 9, 1944 : Carl got up about four o'clock. Did n't read the clock right. I cooked two pumpkins, made some catsup and banked my good roses. Carl went to Keels ' sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the early evening. Carole Sue was so full of pep. <p> Friday, Nov. 10, 1944 : I had one awful mess of dishes and pans to wash. I baked a pumpkin pie and we had cauliflower, sweet potatoes and green beans for dinner. As tomorrow is Armistice Day, we went after groceries, main thing was yeast. I met Margaret and Carole Sue at the 10 cent store. We shopped together. Frank Keith hauled our last load of beans to town. We had to keep them because of such an amount to be sold. <p> Saturday, Nov. 11, 1944 : This is Armistice Day. James Ward and family drove to Piper City to visit with Wayne 's. They went pheasant hunting and got several birds.

We had wieners, meat loaf, chili, coffee, and pie. About as cold a day as we have had.

We got our evening chores done up early and went to the show -- Henry Aldrich in Plays Cupid. Went then to Merle 's and brought Carole Sue home with us.
