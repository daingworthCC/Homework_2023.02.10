5255341 <p> Every field has its rock stars. And in the field of election forecasting, the biggest rock star is currently Nate Silver, the baseball statistician turned election number cruncher at the New York Times, who called 49 of 50 states in the 2008 election and was 50 for 50 in the 2012 election -- demonstrating that election forecasting is here to stay. <p> Among political junkies, though, Dr. Sam Wang of the Princeton Election Consortium is nearly as big a rock star, despite not having swanky digs at the New York Times. Wang is a professor of Neuroscience at Princeton, but in 2004 he started forecasting elections based on analyzing the polls. In 2008 he actually called the electoral college exactly -- save for one split Nebraska vote -- which beat Silver 's 49/50 call. His confidence level for an Obama victory last night was 99.2%, and of course, like Silver, he was vindicated. <p> I had a chance to talk to Wang by email about the election and what the future of elections hold with respect to polling forecasts and aggregation. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the polls were accurate, both the aggregators like RealClearPolitics and the forecasters like you and Nate Silver were pretty much on target for calling an Obama victory in the Electoral College. Have you noticed an improvement in the polls themselves over the past few election cycles? Or have aggregators and forecasters simply gotten better at interpreting them? <p> Pollsters are expert at their craft. As a group, they have done very well at the state level since 2004, the year when I started doing aggregation. I do think the aggregation methods are important. My use of median-based statistics is a way to get rid of outliers : if the numbers say Obama +1, Obama +2, and Romney +9, the right answer is probably Obama +1, the middle value( median), not the average. <p> More sophisticated methods give a sharper picture. For example, my approach extracts lots of information on a day-by-day basis. It was able to identify " shocks " to the campaign that had a real effect : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first debate( really good for Romney). It could also tell when nothing happened( Republican convention, no effect at all). That 's my specialty, getting an optimally sharp picture at all times. <p> One thing I think has emerged is that polls do extremely well by themselves, and did n't need econometric factors to help them. Those econometric factors, which political scientists and Nate Silver love so well, are useful for showing us the tilt of the playing field. Once the ball goes into play, our best measure is polls. <p> Do you think that aggregations and forecasts are going to get more media attention after this election, or do you think the focus is still going to be on day to day polls? <p> The advantage of focusing on aggregation is that this would cut through the noise of individual stories on single polls, which are often not informative. Worse yet, the most exciting poll is the one that is farthest from the rest -- the outlier. This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! If aggregation does a good job, it can reduce the noise -- and set the stage for better reporting. <p> Another area where aggregation and the media could work together is that surveys still have value for their " internals " -- seeing what men and women think, what voters 40-59 think, and so on. <p> If aggregators and forecasters do become more important, does that pose a danger for your data? In 1948, Truman shocked the country by defeating Dewey -- but the polling stopped in September because everyone thought it was a lock. Do you see a danger for your work if media outlets decide not to shell out the expense for polls when forecasts are holding still? <p> That is a very interesting point. Aggregation depends vitally on good polling data. Really, pollsters are the heroes of this story. That would really kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. <p> Do you think it 's possible for campaigns to use forecasting data to swing an election in the future? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be a foregone conclusion in the summer of an election year? <p> I do not think aggregation can necessarily influence an election strongly. After the first debate, opinion swung sharply within one day. That was n't pundits or polling -- that was people watching and deciding. However, I do think that this kind of analysis can swing what commentators say. That is a good thing. As the saying goes, you are entitled to your own opinion, but not your own facts. Poll aggregation is a new category of fact to
