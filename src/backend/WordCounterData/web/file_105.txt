5037041 <h> " It Was a Different Life, But It Was a Good Life " <p> " We just made an old lady happy, " my Aunt was in tears in the back seat of the car. <p> " We did! " My mom was in the passenger seat crying as well. <p> I had not spoken in three hours, a record for me. I was behind the wheel, navigating the car out of the Sister of Charity parking lot in St. Hyacinthe, Canada. " Well, " I said sporting my usual grinchy grin. " I just made three old ladies happy. " <p> Three hours earlier as we climbed the front steps to the convent, I asked my mom and aunt what the proper protocol was. I had never been inside a convent before. I had driven them six hours to see their mother 's sister, a ninety-four year old nun. My mother turned to me with those piercing green eyes she is famous for and said in a very serious tone( the stern voice of my youth) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done. That was when I took my vow of silence. <p> We met Aunt Rosie in the third floor hallway and after a quick tour of her room, she took my arm and led us to a visiting room where we could all sit and chat. As we walked ahead of the other two ladies, she patted my arm with her free hand and said : I pray for you everyday. Well, that certainly explains a lot about the invisible force that always seems to save my ass at the last-minute. It 's good to have connections. <p> Once in the living room, a member of the staff brought us drinks and cookies, and Aunt Rosie began telling one story after another about her life as a nun -- twenty-one years in Haiti and the remaining fifty-four years in convents throughout New England and Canada. I could n't help but smile and wonder if my storytelling abilities were connected to that side of the family. <p> She had six siblings who all married and had families. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one point and looked at my aunt and shrugged. " It was a different life, " she said. " But it was a good life. " <p> Those words and my silence lingered in the car as we made our way back to the border. I 've felt the weight of the world lately and a ton of doubt and regret about a life I gave up seventeen years ago when I threw my first manuscript in the drawer and said " fuck this! " What I tend to forget is that the life I 've had has been beautiful. I have the best kid and family. I 've made a wonderful home for us and have the most amazing group of friends a girl could have. Life is good. <p> In that instant I gave up worrying about getting into THAT MFA program, my first choice. I stopped worrying about publishing Lucky Nova. I stopped worrying period. While it may not have been the life I set out to lead, it 's been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call that I had been accepted into the MFA program. I talk a lot with my students about letting go, perhaps I should start practicing it more myself! <p> Made me giggle throughout :). Loving the clearly well groomed writing style and structure of the post. What I most enjoyed was the knwoledge that you made someone happy. I have had people make me happy " just ' coz " yet it will never beat the feeling we get when we help someone else.
