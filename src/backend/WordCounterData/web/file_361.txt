5062941 <p> There were 14 journalists on the Media Desk. I 'm not sure if every single one was there, but most were, including two females on the desk, Motoko Rich and Stephanie Clifford. I had asked them several times to participate in the picture, I really wanted to represent a full picture. Unfortunately, they both declined. <p> I wondered what Rich and Clifford now think about their decision not to participate. Did they like the documentary after seeing it? Here 's what they told me in emails : <p> STEPHANIE CLIFFORD Andrew did ask me to participate in the film, but I was n't comfortable with it for two main reasons. When he started making the film, the company was going through a rough time, other newspapers were shutting down, and there was a lot of doubt about the future of the industry. Given the timing, I suspected it would be a documentary that painted newspapers, the Times and our group in a bad light.( Andrew came in when the memory of the Jason Jones Daily Show piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned out to be completely wrong -- Andrew 's film was lively and interesting, and he showed the great personalities of the media group just as they are, but I was n't sure enough of his intentions going in. <p> The other reason I declined was because I was covering media people, who are pretty jittery about being covered to begin with. Many of them were talking to me on background or off the record, and probably would have been fired if their bosses found out they were talking to me. I did n't want to compromise my sources, or alter the quality of an interview, by asking them to be on camera or having to tell them a filmmaker was recording my end of the interview. I was also imagining what would happen if, say, a particular Conde Nast caller ID showed up on my phone and the shot was accidentally included in the film -- it would have gotten the people I talk to in trouble, and that 's not fair to them. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great portrait of what the journalists here do. And yes, I was totally envious when I saw Brian Stelter strutting the red carpet at the premiere, but that 's mainly because he has a better figure than I do nowadays. <p> MOTOKO RICH I really enjoyed Page One. As you 've probably heard, we had a staff screening in the Times Center and it was great to feel the warmth in the room for our friends in the film. I thought David Carr was a phenomenal movie presence, and Bruce Headlam was a break-out star.( Did you see his appearance on The Daily Show? The movie was n't a fluke...) And along with Brian Stelter, Tim Arango and Richard Perez-Pena, they all came across as fighting the good fight for the journalism we believe in. <p> It 's not quite accurate to say I completely declined to participate in the film, as I did give one to-camera interview to Andrew. It did n't end up getting used. <p> It is fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me around on interviews or on the phone. That was a personal choice ; I 'm happy to give interviews about my published stories, but did n't feel comfortable being shadowed. It 's not my style and I worried my sources might feel uncomfortable. Still, more power to my colleagues, who represented the media pod and newspaper with great panache. <p> COMING SOON : A Q-and-A with Andrew Rossi, who told me in email on Nov. 14 that " I am jumping on a plane to Paris for the French premiere of the film( the success of the movie internationally is actually a great story). " <h> Archive <p> Is n't it somewhat outrageous that journalists that routinely ask sources to reveal secrets about their own organizations cowardly refuse speak openly about their own media companies? Even though policing media coverage is probably far more socially useful than things those journalists cover. <p> Albert911emt said : November 21, 2011 3:18 pm <p> AngryKrugman, reporters are people too, and they do n't want to lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearing in a film that may compromise what they do everyday. Most people look out for their own selfish interests first, including yourself. <p> george krimsky said : January 26, 2012 9:52 am <p> Jim : <p> Can you post this? Tewfik was known and beloved by a lot of Washington biggies, and I figure this is the best way to reach them.... <p> GK <p> -0- <p> Tewfik Mishlawi, the first director of training at what is now the International Center for Journalists in Washington, died on Jan. 25. <p> A legendary journalist in the Middle East, Tewfik succumbed to heart failure at the American University Hospital in Beirut after a fall at his home in the Lebanese capital. He was 76. <p> Tewfik directed training programs at what was then called the Center for Foreign Journalists in Reston, VA, from 1985, the center ' first year of operation, until 1992, when he returned to Beirut following the retirement of his longtime partner at the daily newsletter called the Middle East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core, " George Krimsky, the first president and co-founder of the Center, said from his home in Connecticut. " We had worked together in Beirut during the civil war, and I thought he would be perfect to launch our training programs at the Center. He was. " <p> Although initially reluctant to leave his beloved Beirut, Tewfik accepted the challenge and spent seven years on these shores with his wife, Phillipa and their young son, Nadim. " He was already well-known by many in the Washington press corps, and that gave us a needed leg up in those early days, " Krimsky said. <p> For every foreign correspondent who came to Beirut after the outbreak of war in the mid-1970s, their first stop was usually the MER office off Hamra Street to find out what was really going on, not only in Lebanon but throughout the Mideast. " Tewfik and his partner, Ihsan Hijazi, monitored the Arab media closely and were among the very few who could make sense of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palestinian by birth, Tewfik stood out as a professional journalist who believed in the ultimate value of truth gathered from hard facts. He taught and ran programs for hundreds of visiting journalists from developing countries on how best to find and report that truth. " He never veered from that course, " Krimsky said. <p> Through the ' 90s, Tewfik wrote on a freelance basis for the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal,
