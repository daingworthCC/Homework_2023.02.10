5050741 <h> Why Magneto will kick all of them asses! <p> Magneto, everyone knows him but let me just remind you that he has the power to manipulate metal. Many of you MyIGNers may be wondering why I say that Magneto would kick all of those superhero 's and villian 's and anyone who stands in his way 's asses. Before I continue I would like to point out that Magneto is not 100% a bad guy. As I said before, Magneto has the power to manipulate metal therefore all of us have iron in our bodies and iron is a metal thus Magneto can control us into doing whatever he wants eg. if we are planning shoot him with a bazooka then instead of stopping the bazooka bullet he can stop us from even lifting up the bazooka to aim at him etc. He has the helmet which stops Professor - X from entering into his mind and stops all sorts of telekinissis from affecting him. If someone somehow manages to remove the helmet from his head he would be able to get it back by just snapping his fingers as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now you see that what I am saying is completely true. <p> If you have found any superhero or villian that is real and not made up by you who can defeat Magneto then feel free to tell me in the comments below
