If she can not respond to your question, we will forward it to the Association 's Center for Information and Community Support where they will be individually answered as soon as possible. <p> You can also contact the Center directly by chatting with us at diabetes.org or calling 1-800-DIABETES( 1-800-342-2383). Its hours of operation are Monday - Friday, 8:30 AM - 8 PM Eastern Standard Time. <p> I have a food sensitivity for all nuts except peanuts and all berries except strawberries. I am looking for some between-meal snacks that will be good for my prediabetes. Can you give some suggestions outside of my limitations? <p> Answer <p> Even with your food sensitivities, you still have plenty of snack options. Snacks can help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day. But that means choosing foods wisely. Snack time is a great opportunity to fit in another serving of whole grains, fruits, or vegetables! These foods are lower in fat and calories compared to most salty snacks and sweets. They will also fill you up and give you the energy you need. <p> Watch portion sizes to make sure you are n't going overboard when snacking. Over-eating will lead to extra calories in your diet, which can contribute to weight gain. So, resist those trips to the vending machine -- plan ahead and pack a healthy snack! <p> Below are just a few ideas to get you started. You can also check out our snacking page for even more options! <p> My husband has diabetes. Every morning, we have oatmeal with half of a banana and milk. Is oatmeal okay for him? <p> Answer <p> Oatmeal is a good, whole grain breakfast choice. We recommend that everyone choose whole grain foods as much as possible over refined grains like white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more vitamins, minerals, and fiber. So, oatmeal is a good choice, but it does have some carbohydrates. <p> It 's important for people with diabetes to watch their carbohydrate intake. Having too much at once will disrupt blood glucose levels. The breakfast you described consists of several high-carbohydrate foods. So, your husband will need to consider his carbohydrate range at breakfast time and think about what portion sizes of those foods will fit with his meal plan. The following carb counts may be helpful : <p> 1/2 cup of cooked oatmeal has about 15 grams of carbohydrate( if it is cooked with water, not milk) <p> 1/2 of a large banana had about 15 grams of carbohydrate <p> 1 cup of milk has about 12 grams of carbohydrate <p> This breakfast above has about 42 grams of carbohydrate. So, if he can have 30-45 grams of carbohydrate at breakfast, these serving sizes would work with his plan. If his limit is more or less, he 'll want to adjust the portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but occasionally I like to have a sandwich... what is the best bread? <p> Answer <p> Navigating the bread aisle at the grocery store can be tricky -- there are so many options! We suggest choosing one that is a good source of whole grains. A lot of the time, bread is made with refined grains or a refined flour. " Refined " means that part of the grain has been removed, so you miss out on a lot of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. <p> Whole grains include the entire grain kernel and provide all of the nutrients that grains have to offer. Look for bread that is labeled " 100% whole grain " or " 100% whole wheat. " This means that the bread is only made with whole wheat flour. Products that say " contains whole grain " may only contain a small amount of whole wheat flour. <p> You can also see if your bread is a good source of whole grains is by looking at the ingredient list. Ingredients are listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredient on the list makes up the largest proportion of the food. The best breads will list whole wheat flour as the first ingredient and the only flour in the product. Do n't be fooled by terms like wheat flour, enriched wheat flour, multi grain, stone-ground flour, unbleached wheat flour or other similar terms. These are not whole grain flours. <p> Some whole wheat breads are made mostly with whole wheat flour but still have a small amount of refined flours in them. If one or two refined flours are included in the ingredient list but are farther down on the list, the bread is still a good source of whole grains. <p> Remember that bread is a starchy food, so it 's important to count it in your meal plan -- even if you choose a whole grain option. The serving size and amount of carbohydrates can vary a lot from product to product so be sure to check nutrition labels. <p> My doctor wants me to eat small meals every 4 hours, with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intolerant ; does that change my options for complex carbohydrates? <p> Answer <p> There is a growing group of people out there who have a gluten intolerance. When you are gluten-intolerant, you experience uncomfortable symptoms when you eat foods that contain the protein gluten. To avoid these symptoms, it 's necessary to follow a gluten-free diet. <p> Gluten is found in wheat, rye, and barley and any foods made with these grains. As you can imagine, eliminating gluten from your diet can be challenging. There are many foods and food additives that contain gluten or are cross-contaminated with gluten during processing. Many of these foods are things you would never think of like lunch meats, broth, salad dressing, etc. <p> Complex carbs are often referred to as starchy foods. Though you need to avoid gluten, you still have a lot of options. The following is a list of starchy foods that are also gluten-free : <p> You can also choose to buy gluten-free crackers or bread. Just be aware that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their wheat-based counterparts. They may also differ in the amount of carbohydrate grams per serving, which can make a difference when you are carbohydrate counting and meal planning. For example, gluten-free bread can have twice as many carbohydrate grams as whole wheat bread. So, always check labels when you choose to buy these products. <p> How many calories are in a 12-ounce beer and how many in a regular soda? How much weight can you lose if you stop drinking beverages with calories? For example, if I drink 3-4 12 ounce sodas per day how much I can lose if I stop? <p> Answer <p> Both beer and regular soda can add a significant amount of calories to your diet : <p> One 12-ounce can of regular soda has about 150 calories. <p> One 12-ounce Bud Light has about 110 calories. <p> Most regular beers have around 150 calories in 12 ounces, but some craft and specialty beers have significantly more than that. At this time, nutrition labeling is not required on alcoholic beverages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calories do as well. <p> For many people, cutting out alcohol and/or sugary beverages is helpful for losing weight. If you think about it, the calories can add up fast. Having four cans of regular soda every day amounts to about 600 calories. For some people, that 's 1/3 of the calories they need for an entire day! <p> When it comes to weight loss, remember that one pound is equal to 3,500 calories. So, if you want to lose 1 pound per week, you would need to cut 500 calories from what you usually eat in a day. So, switching to diet or another zero-calorie drink could be an easy way to get started losing weight. <p> Also, calories from sugary beverages do n't fill us up as much as solid food. We recommend choosing zero calorie drinks as much as possible. Avoid beverages like regular soda, fruit punch, fruit drinks, energy drinks, sweet tea, and other sugary drinks. These will raise blood glucose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Instead, stick to zero or very low-calorie drinks like water, unsweetened teas, coffee, diet soda, and other low-calorie drinks and drink mixes. <p> For more information about our alcohol guidelines and other tips, visit the Alcohol page. <p> I have type 2 diabetes, and wanted to know how many carbs I can have each day, broken down to number of carbs per meal. <p> Answer <p> This is a very common question among people with diabetes. If you have diabetes, we recommend following a meal plan that will help you meet your diabetes goals. First, you 'll need to work with your healthcare provider to set these goals, which might include losing weight, improving your A1C, lowering your blood pressure and/or lowering cholesterol levels. <p> It sounds like you have n't set up an individualized meal plan yet, so we suggest including about 45-60 grams of carbohydrate per meal to start. If you follow that recommendation, you would be eating a total of about 135-180 grams of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and some people may need less than the recommendation above, so talk to your healthcare team about setting a plan soon! <p> We were wondering - can you use coconut palm sugar in place of regular cane sugar? <p> Answer <p> Coconut palm sugar is a sugar substitute that seems to be gaining popularity. It is made from sap that is extracted from the coconut tree. The taste of pure coconut palm sugar is similar to brown sugar. For cooking purposes, it can usually be used as a substitute for sugar in most baked goods. <p> Manufacturers of coconut palm sugar boast its lower glycemic index compared to regular sugar. Glycemic index( GI) is a measure of how a food raises blood glucose( or blood sugar) compared to a reference food( usually glucose or white bread). In the United States, we do not do official GI testing. So, GI numbers for the same food can differ depending on your source. <p> GI can also vary from person to person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooked, and what the food is eaten with. In the case of coconut palm sugar, it is likely to be mixed or prepared with other ingredients that contain carbohydrates if used in baking. <p> It is okay for people with diabetes to use coconut palm sugar as a sweetener, but they should not treat it any differently than regular sugar. It provides just as many calories and carbohydrates : about 15 calories and 4 grams of carbohydrate per teaspoon. So, you still need to account for it when planning meals. <p> Also, note that some coconut palm sugar on the market may be mixed with cane sugar and other ingredients. It is important to check nutrition labels and read the ingredient list on these products. <p> I have been reading that vinegar decreases insulin resistance. Is there any truth to this? <p> Answer <p> A few smaller studies have explored the effect of vinegar on blood glucose levels in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Some of the studies have shown positive results, however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend a regular dose of vinegar for the purpose of controlling blood glucose levels. More larger, robust studies are needed before making a recommendation like this. <p> Right now, the best way to control blood glucose levels is by eating well, being physically active and taking any medications and/or insulin as prescribed by your doctor. Space the carbohydrates you eat throughout the day and pay attention to portion sizes. If you are overweight, losing about 10-15 pounds can make it easier to manage your blood glucose. <p> Can someone with diabetes eat white potatoes or should they be avoided? I 'm finding a lot of conflicting information. <p> Answer <p> All potatoes( white, red, sweet, etc.) contain about the same amount of carbohydrate and will raise blood glucose. You can still eat potatoes, but you need to be mindful of portion sizes and count them in your meal plan. <p> Though they contain carbohydrates, potatoes also provide you with many other important nutrients like potassium, fiber, and vitamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitamin A!) They have no sodium, fat, or cholesterol. To get the maximum amount of fiber from potatoes, make sure you leave the skin on. <p> Keeping track of your carbohydrate intake and setting a maximum amount to eat can help keep your blood glucose levels in your target range. The following portion sizes and carb counts may be helpful when potatoes are on the menu. <p> There are about 15 grams of carbohydrate in : <p> of a large baked potato <p> cup of mashed potatoes <p> cup of boiled potatoes <p> If you use the Plate Method to plan meals, you can fill about of a 9-inch plate with them, and enjoy them as a side dish along with some non-starchy vegetables and a source of lean protein. <p> Many of us like to flavor our potatoes with extra ingredients. When choosing what to add, choose wisely and do n't go overboard! Some toppings can add a lot of extra calories and saturated fat. Here are some healthier topping ideas : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tablespoons of low-fat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream <p> 1 teaspoon chopped chives or other herbs and spices that you like(
