5038341 <h> The heart and soul of Election Day ; over 400 poll workers turn out to help on Nov. 6 <p> For most Humboldt County residents, dropping by their local polling station constitutes the extent of their civic duty on Election Day. But for Humboldt County 's more than 400 poll workers, Election Day is an all-day affair. <p> Deborah Storre -- a poll worker at Zane Middle School for the past 10 years -- likens the experience to jury duty. <p> " It 's something all citizens should do because elections only run as smoothly as the people who are working them, " the 68-year-old said. <p> Storre grew up in Eureka, but gave up her United States citizenship when she moved to Canada after marrying her husband. When she moved back to Eureka in 2001 and reapplied for citizenship, Storre decided she wanted to give back to her native country. So when the Humboldt County Election 's Office called her up and said they need an inspector -- the lead poll worker at a precinct-- she agreed. <p> " I just decided it was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since, " she said. <p> Humboldt County Registrar of Voters Carolyn Crnich said poll workers are responsible for setting up and maintaining security at their polling stations -- and much more. <p> They greet voters in line, show them were to sign on the roster and hand out ballots, she said. Once the last voter has left the booth, the poll workers real job begins. <p> " At the end of the day, they are responsible for accounting for every piece of ballot paper handed out at the polls. <p> Advertisement <p> They make sure every ballot gets counted and delivered to our office, " Crnich " We say we have a democracy of the people, by the people, for the people. Poll workers are those people ensuring that is true. " <p> Storre said accounting for all of the ballots is the hardest part of the job. <p> " I have heard it likened to trying to balance a checkbook when you have been awake for three days, " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after sheet of signatures when you 've been up since 4:30 a.m., but when it all works out it 's very satisfying. " <p> The poll workers job begins on the eve of Election Day, when they start setting up the polling booths at their precinct. At 7 a.m. the following morning, the poll workers officially announce that the polls are open. The polls do n't close until 8 p.m. after the last ballot has been cast. On a good night, Storre said, everything is turned off, accounted for and ready to be handed over to the election 's office by 9:30 p.m. <p> Although poll workers do receive a small stipend, Crnich said given the number of hours they work, it is n't much. <p> Storre --who estimated that she and the three other poll workers at her polling station spent about 16 hours working at Zane Middle School on Nov. 6 -- said she does n't do it for the money. <p> " I think the vast majority of voters are so appreciative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " she said. " That 's enough to keep me coming back each year. " <p> Eureka resident Tom Peters agreed. The 67-year-old has served as a poll worker for nine years and said he plans to keep coming back as long as he can. <p> " I 'm certainly not in it for the big bucks, " he said. " It 's not rocket science work, but you get to greet all kinds of people and share with them that experience of voting. It really does carry its own energy. " <p> Crnich said the elections office is always looking for more dedicated poll workers like Peters and Storre. <p> " Ideally, we would like to have about four workers at each precinct, " she said. " That 's the standard we aim for. " <p> Crnich said maintaining those numbers can be hard in some of the far-flung precincts like Hoopa, Bridgeville and Garberville. <p> This year, Crnich said she had to call up 58-year-old Jeni Sue Wilburn, a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind helping out at an under-staffed Hoopa polling station. <p> Wilburn said the long drive seemed daunting at first, but she was glad she did. <p> " It turned out to be a fine day, " Wilburn said. " I guess it was a record turnout, the three other poll workers there said they had never seen so many people out to vote. It feels good to help with that. " <p> Crnich said it would be ideal if members or residents of a precinct worked at the polls in the precinct in which they lived, but that does n't always happen. <p> " Thankfully, we maintain a list of people who -- bless their little hearts -- we can call and ask to come in if someone does n't turn up -- like Jeni, " she said. " We just have to work with what we have. " <p> Although the next big election wo n't be until the 2014 presidential election, Crnich said she hopes more county residents will consider signing up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the heart and soul of an election, " she said. " What they do really gets to the root of what an election in a democracy is all about. When it comes
