In fact, they are required to reference at least one book, magazine, or newspaper when doing a report. It should be part of the Common Core Standards that students be required to reference more than one source instead of becoming over reliant on the internet. <h> Loading comments... <p> What a shame that so many young people think that the information they receive on Wikipedia is correct. The really shocking thing is that their teachers accept that bad information. Why do so many educators allow their students to take what is considered the easy way out? It 's not so easy always because not all of the information can be counted on. What happened to the encyclopedia and peer reviewed articles? <h> Loading comments... <p> I think the most disturbing thing we 've learned is how many people rely on Wikipedia instead of credible research. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information is n't properly cited and contains inaccuracies and yet this is what Students are using to do research? No, no, and no! <h> Loading comments... <p> I am a student at a college in Chattanooga, TN. I found your article on students ' response to Wikipedia 's protest of PIPA and SOPA completely biased and shallow. You only showed the opinions of those lazy students who can not accomplish homework on their own. I think it is wonderful that large corporations are standing up to this legislation that will make America 's networks no better than that of China or Middle Eastern countries. I am sure there many students who would gladly sacrifice one measly Wikipedia use to help protect our freedom. <h> Loading comments... <h> Loading comments... <p> I have no problem with Wikipedia as a website but students should not be using it for research, period. If Wikipedia shut down for an entire school year just imagine how many students might actually learn something credible : O <h> Loading comments... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the whole semester. I remember reading about a student who said that writing a paper was n't so hard-all he had to do was cut and paste. This was seen as positive since at least he was staying in school. There must be some other alternative. <h> Loading comments... <p> Look, please do n't associate these reactions with all of academia. I am a senior student at Boise State and never once has any professor ever allowed Wikipedia as a source for anything. Real students do not rely on Wikipedia except for entertainment or as launch pages. Maybe the younger generation is using this is a credible source( high school and younger) but once they hit the Universities they will find out while Wiki is usually accurate, it is not a credible source in any academic endeavor. Wikipedia made the right choice with the blackout, SOPA needs to be killed. Also, the semester just started, where is all the homework? I have none :). <p> SpiralingDownward : Look, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <h> Loading comments... <p> This is a sad statement about the youth of today. Ironically, some are upset with the very organization that is protesting the possibility of government oversight( SOPA/PIPA). It would be a shame if these students had to use a search engine to find the location of their local public library. Use Mapquest to find out how to get there. Google " How to find a physical hardbound encyclopedia " and " What is a Dewey Decimal System? ". Finally, posting a pic of the library on their Facebook wall for their friends. Maybe tweet about the experience. I guess their homework will be late! <p> Even without Wikipedia why would anyone go to a library? To search through books that are outdated in hopes of finding a paragraph or even a sentence that is directly related to the topic you are writing about. It 's inefficient and a waste of time, and there are better resources out there, not including Wikipedia. <h> Loading comments... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the point? That 's just inefficiency for inefficiency 's sake. Just because it 's the way research used to be done does not make it any better. There are a wealth of resources on the internet that are more reliable than wikipedia and more efficient than a physical encyclopedia. <h> Loading comments... <p> The " Everyone Gets a Trophy " generation rears its ugly head again... Nice job preparing these kids for the real world. Maybe today is a good day for your first ever visit to the Library! I can recall going to several every time I had a term paper due. Guess they will have to actually type the words into the document instead of just cutting and pasting while plagiarizing. <h> Loading comments... <p> I did n't know that Wiki was the only online encyclopedia or source for information...... <p> Try spending a couple of hours just finding a book with the data you are seeking then having to go through that book to find that little nugget......... That was back in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heaven help us if
