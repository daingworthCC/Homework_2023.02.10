This is an adorable restaurant with absolutely delicious food. Barbara and Holly have created a unique and wonderful experience in Reno for people who love to get together over great food. I ca n't wait to sign up for one of the many cooking classes offered. I will also be singing the praises of this gem to everyone I know. <h> Review from Lisa R. <p> Way cool! My good friend gave me a gift certificate to their cooking school and I 'm stoked. <p> A click of the website reveals a partial pic of this appealing Victorian Home now converted into a cooking school and restaurant. <p> While waiting for the October cooking class schedule to come out, I noticed B. of T. H. is now open for lunch, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., Weds through Friday. <p> Although B. of T. H. keeps the shortest restaurant hours on the planet, I immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thusly : <p> $15 per <p> You choose 1 of 2 entrees <p> and 1 of 2 side salads. These are different each day. <p> Little bite deserts are included. <p> Wanting to try everything, my friend and I ordered opposite items. <p> She had chili and spinach salad I had a pesto turkey sammie and a curry chicken salad <p> The server helped out by bringing me my own chili. It was thoughtful though this is among the worst chili I have tried. Two bites and I was done. My friend thought it was okay( Yes, this makes me question my friend 's taste, but we do n't always vote the same way either!!). The home made corn bread served with the chili was quite good. It was a denser, country style and I liked it. <p> The chili was ultra mild. That 's fine, but where are the onions? It consisted of cooked hamburger chunks slathered in a nondescript sauce. They served it with brown rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top. Strange -- and not in a good way. <p> My sandwich was okay, nothing special. <p> My curry chicken salad was a lesson in perfection. The curry and chicken flavors were complimented by cranberries and cashews mixed in, all served over a bed of fresh spinach. The chicken consisted of all white meat( my fave!!!) cooked to a turn. <p> Free and fantastic wine Spritzers were included just for mentioning their ad. Their secret ingredient is gingerale. <p> I ordered Ice tea. It was flavorless. I mentioned this and they took it away to the bad ice tea dungeon. <p> Little bite deserts are included. The brownie is to die for with just a hint of thin frosting. The mini vanilla cupcake puts batch cupcakery to shame. Great frosting and great cake both. <p> Note : This place makes speciality cupcakes and 6 layer cakes. The cakes start at about $40, but if these deserts are any indication, baking is their forte. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street parking, but have since found out -- by reading their website -- that patrons are encourage to " Park across the street in the Walton lot. " <p> Seating is farm table style, so you could end up eating with someone fun, or not. <p> Because the indoor tables were full, we were seated outside the kitchen door on a patio. The server adjusted the table umbrella to screen out the direct sunlight, but we were n't terribly comfortable in the heat. However, since we were alone, I could comment freely on everything and I did. Yes, I know I should be a judge on Top Chef, thank you for noticing! <p> After the big parties left we were moved inside. <p> B. of T. H. owns a fancy coffee machine that makes your coffee by the cup from little packages containing concentrated syrups. Coffee is only $2.50 and includes a free refill. We both tried the Chai coffee, which was Eh. <p> According to my pallete and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste that is only available in fresh ground coffee. <p> However, it 's better than coffee shop coffee and comes in numerous varieties. <p> If you are searching for an upper-crust hostess gift, try their stock of jams, jellies and other yummies. For about $10 each these look marvelous. I want to try the balsamic onion jam and the lemon buttercream( just in case anyone reading this wants to bring me a gift!). <p> When the food is good, it 's very very good. When it 's bad, well, it 's terrible. <p> They plied us with free coffee, extra chili, and Spritzers. Given all that we got, $15 each was a good price even without the entrees. We appreciated this and tipped $10. <p> The house is gorgeous -- very French country chic and worth a look. <p> Since the restaurant portion has barely been open a month, I harbor big hope for Back of the House. <p> I hope other Yelpers will try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scene. <p> Since I have a gift card, I 'll be taking a cooking class here soon and will faithfully Yelp it! <h> Review from Micaela M. <p> Let me tell you, I had so much fun!! Barbara, the proprietor and chef, is very exuberant, lovely, and obviously adores her job. <p> The kitchen is very organized, with amazing utensils at every station. The class size is smaller, but that makes for more cooking time, and more one on one supervision by Barbara. The equipment is top of the line, and it shows. <p> The staff is friendly and laid back. There were two girls there to help with clean up and to do the dishes. They were lovely girls and very nice and helpful. <p> Barbara has her own station at the front of the room, all decked out with a camera and a television, so that you can see what she is demonstrating. Barbara is not much on a lot of instruction and much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, especially when it comes to flipping crepes. <p> Overall, my experience was great. I am going to come back for sure! My only complaint is that it was supposed to a singles mixer, and there were three couples there! What was that all about? <h> Review from Susie K. <p> " Whim " restaurant at Back of the House Cooking School is a wonderful place to lunch! Barbara Mills, the owner/chef is charming, fun and enthusiastic about her business. I always order the " Whim " special, because it gives me a chance to try a couple of different things AND still have a taste of dessert( you get this adorable little 3-part tray with samples of three different and always delicious sweets du jour). The restaurant/cooking school is housed in a cute little Victorian bungalow on Second Street in Reno and it 's a great place to take a friend to a special lunch. <h> Review from Mandy N. <p> A group of four of us went here for lunch today. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Very nicely done inside, in a casual style. We all went on a " Whim ", or we all goit the Whim menu, which is a sandwich, soup or salad, the dessert trio and a drink all for $16. We were given a sample of therir special watermelon salad for the day, and it was delicious. All four of us ordered the French sandwich, with different salads. The French sandwich was simply delish - roasted turkey and carmelized onions with melted brie - yum! It was the perfect size, also. Some of us had the special broccoli salad, and that was very tasty. I had the spinach salad. It had a fabulous dressing, crumbled feta and candied pecans. It was very tasty. Our dessert trio was a bread pudding square, a little ice cream sundae, and a vanilla parfait. All were scrumptious. The only thing holding me back from giving 5 stars is the servivce. The food was delicious, the atmosphere good - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't attentive. One in my group wanted to change her salad to sa different kind right after we ordered, but we could never get the attention of anyone to come over to the table. I sat with an empty iced tea glass until they brought the food, and then they asked if I wanted a refill. They were very nice, they just need to be a little more aware of giving guest service. I would definitely recommend trying
