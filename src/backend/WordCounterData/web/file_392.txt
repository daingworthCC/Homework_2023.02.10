5066041 <p> I am SEO and LINk builder but new comer. Now I would like to ask you that <p> Frequently, I have seen someone writing PR1, PR2, PR3 And PR4. <p> But What is the main theme or definition of PR??? <p> Please give me this answer as if i can get real idea about PR. <p> Thanks <p> sousen <p> 09-23-2010, 07:23 AM <p> PageRank is what Google uses to determine the importance of a web page. It 's one of many factors used to determine which pages appear in search results.PageRank measure 's a web page 's importance. Page and Brin 's theory is that the most important pages on the Internet are the pages with the most links leading to them. PageRank thinks of links as votes, where a page linking to another page is casting a vote. This makes sense, because people do tend to link to relevant content, and pages with more links to them are usually better resources than pages that nobody links. <p> websiteseo <p> 09-25-2010, 10:53 AM <p> Hello Friends, <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real idea about PR. <p> Thanks <p> Page rank is loosing its credibility.

PR and ranking in SERP are two different things. So you must identify very well what is your campaign - to gain PR or to rank? <p> Dheeram <p> 10-01-2010, 04:24 AM <p> Google uses the gross no of inbound links to a page to determine how important the page is. This page rank has little to do with actual search results, but can make a difference on user behavior. <p> philipashton <p> 10-12-2010, 11:30 AM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page 's importance. It matters because it is one of the factors that determines a page 's ranking in the search results. It is n't the only factor that Google uses to rank pages, but it is an important one. " <p> Not all links are counted by Google. For instance, they filter out links from known link farms. Some links can cause a site to be penalized by Google. <p> Page rank is truly one of many factors that determines where your web page appears in search result ranking, but if all your other factors are equal
