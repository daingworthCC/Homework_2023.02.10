5080741 <p> This chapter describes level-of-service( LOS) rating systems suitable for evaluating the quality of various transport modes from users ' perspective. This helps create a more neutral planning decisions that involve tradeoffs between different transport modes. <h> Description <p> Multi-Modal Level-of-Service Indicators are rating systems used to evaluate various transportation modes and impacts. Level of Service( also called Quality of Service or Service Quality) refers to the speed, convenience, comfort and security of transportation facilities and services as experienced by users. Level-Of-Service( LOS) ratings, typically from A( best) to F( worst), are widely used in transport Planning to evaluate problems and potential solutions. Because they are easy to understand( they are similar to the schools grades), Level-Of-Service rating often influence transport planning decisions. Such ratings systems can be used identify problems, establish Performance Indicators and targets, evaluate potential solutions, compare locations, and track trends. <p> Current planning tends to evaluate transportation system performance based primarily on motor vehicle traffic speed and delay( tables 1 and 2). There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This tends to favor highway expansion over other types of transportation improvements, contributing to Automobile Dependency. <p> Table 1 Roadway Level-Of-Service( LOS) Ratings( Wikipedia) <p> LOS <p> Description <p> Speed <p>( mph) <p> Flow( veh. /hour/lane) <p> Density <p>( veh. /mile) <p> A <p> Traffic flows at or above the posted speed limit and all motorists have complete mobility between lanes. <p> Over 60 <p> Under 700 <p> Under 12 <p> B <p> Slightly congested, with some impingement of maneuverability.

Most experienced drivers are comfortable, and posted speed is maintained, but roads are close to capacity. This is often the target LOS for urban highways. <p> 54-57 <p> 1,100-1,550 <p> 20-30 <p> D <p> Typical of an urban highway during commuting hours.

A road for which the travel time can not be predicted. <p> Under 30 <p> Unstable <p> 67-Maximum <p> This table summarizes roadway Level of Service( LOS) rating. These only account for motor vehicle traffic speeds and congestion delay. Other impacts and modes are often ignored. <p> This rating system is used to define transportation problems and prioritize transportation system improvements, resulting in resources being directed at highway expansion. Transportation engineers often produce maps showing roadway links and intersections considered to have excess traffic congestion( Level-of-Service rating D or worse), which is used to prioritize roadway expansion projects. This methodology is criticized as being technically flawed and biased, because it ignores( Cortright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volumes and speeds to increase problems such as traffic accidents, pollution emissions and sprawl. <p> Negative impacts that wider roads and increased vehicle traffic speeds tend to have on Walking and Cycling travel( and therefore public transit travel, since most transit trips include walking links). <p> Some jurisdictions codify this bias toward automobile-oriented improvements with concurrency requirements and development fees, which imposes restrictions and fees on new development that increases local traffic congestion as measured by roadway LOS ratings. This tends to discourage infill development and encourage sprawl( Cortright 2010 ; CUTR 2006 and 2008). Application of Multi-Modal Level-Of-Service standards supports infill development and Smart Growth by allowing roadway LOS ratings to decline provided that LOS ratings for other modes improve, and by allowing development fees to finance Nonmotorized and Public Transit improvements rather than just roadway expansion. <p> The development and use of Multi-Modal Level-of-Service Indicators is consistent with current trends toward more Comprehensive and balanced transport planning that considers diverse modes and impacts( Cambridge Systematics 2010). Such indicators can help respond to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be considered in transport planning. For example, travelers may sometimes be willing to accept lower speeds for increased convenience and comfort, and improvements to other modes besides roadway. Multi-Modal LOS Indicators can help identify if a particular planning decision has undesirable indirect effects, such as when road or parking facility expansion degrades walking and cycling conditions. It is particularly important for TDM Evaluation, because it considers a broader range of options and impacts, and reflects factors that influence traveler behavior. <p> Multi-Modal Level-of-Service Indicators can be used for travel demand Modeling. An improvement in a mode 's Level-of-Service rating reflects an increase in its speed, convenience and comfort, which, all else being equal, should increase demand for that mode. The rating factors can be quantified to measure changes in service quality. <p> Multi-Modal Level-of-Service Indicators can be used to establish Performance Standards and targets. For example, a strategic transportation plan include a target that all walking and cycling facilities should have at least a C Level-of-Service rating, and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to C within two years, and should reach LOS B within five years. This establishes a framework for identifying problems and prioritizing transportation system improvements. <p> Comprehensive Level-of-Service Indicators are particularly important for improving public transit and walking transport, because their travel conditions are directly affected by public planning decisions, as indicated in Table 3. For example, motorists supply their own parking garages and vehicles and so directly control comfort features such as seating quality, temperature control and refreshment availability( cupholders). In contrast, public transit travelers publicly supplied sidewalks and paths, stops and stations, park- &-ride; facilities, and vehicles. It is not generally possible for an individual traveler to purchase improved walking conditions, nicer stops and stations, higher transit service speeds, or a nicer bus or train with additional convenience and comfort features( such as cupholders) ; improving these facilities and services requires public planning that responds to user needs and preferences. For example, some travelers might shift from driving to public transit if it had better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to identify and evaluate such consumer demands in the planning process. <p> Table 3 Provision of Transportation System Components <p> Providers <p> Automobile <p> Public Transit <p> Walking &; Cycling <p> Private <p> Residential <p> garage <p> Vehicle <p> Shoes and bikes <p> Public <p> Roads <p> Destination parking <p> Sidewalks and paths <p> Stops and stations <p> Park- &-Ride; facilities <p> Vehicle( bus or train) <p> Sidewalks and paths <p> Road crossing conditions <p> Automobile users provide their own garage and vehicles and so have greater direct control over convenience and comfort features. Public transit users depend much more on publicly supplied facilities and services and so are more affected by the methods use to evaluate service quality. <p> Multi-modal LOS Indicators can help guide planning decisions to favor efficient modes and trips for transport system Prioritization for a Green Transportation Hierarchy. This essentially reverses priorities of transport planning which relies on roadway Level-of-Service ratings to allocate resources to increase automobile traffic volume and speed, with little consideration of other modes and problems. <p> Green Transportation Hierarchy( TA, 2001 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3. Public Transportation <p> 4. Service and Freight Vehicles <p> 5. Taxis <p> 6. Multiple Occupant Vehicles <p> 7. Single Occupant Vehicles <p> The Green Transportation Hierarchy favors more efficient( in terms of space, energy and other costs) modes. <h> Non-Motorized( Walking and Cycling) Conditions and Facilities <p> Table 4 lists factors to consider when evaluating Walking and Cycling Facilities such as sidewalks, paths and trails( together called nonmotorized networks). Several walking and cycling Level-Of-Service rating systems have been developed. Some are more complete than others. For example, some focus on walkway conditions and give little consideration to roadway crossings, while others focus on roadway crossing conditions and give little consideration to walkways. <p> WalkScore( www.walkscore.com) calculates the walkability of a location based on proximity to public services such as stores, schools and parks. However, it does not consider any other factors, such as the presence or quality of walking and cycling facilities( sidewalks, paths, crosswalks, etc.) or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road widths, traffic volumes and speeds, etc.), or the quality of the pedestrian environment. <p> The Walkability Checklist( **40;13155;TOOLONG...), developed by the Partnership for a Walkable America and the Pedestrian and Bicycle Information Center, provides an easy-to-use form for evaluating neighborhood walkability, taking account factors such as the quality of sidewalks and paths, roadway crossing conditions( crosswalks, and traffic speeds and volumes), the degree of care by motorist, and amenities such as shade trees and street lighting along sidewalks, as perceive by users. <p> Cycling LOS takes into account the availability of parallel bicycle paths, the number of unsignalized intersections and driveways( because they create conflicts between cyclists and other vehicles), width of outside through lane or bicycle lane( the degree of separation between bicyclists and motor vehicle traffic), motor vehicle traffic volumes and speeds, portion of heavy vehicles( large trucks and buses), the presences of parallel parked cars, grades( hills), and special conflicts such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facility crowding, the presence of sidewalks and paths, vehicle traffic speeds and volumes, perceived separation between pedestrians and motor vehicle traffic( including barriers such as parked cars and trees), street crossing widths, extra walking required to reach crosswalks, average pedestrian crossing delay( time needed to wait for a gap in traffic or a crosswalk signal), and special conflicts such as multiple free right-turn lanes( which tend to be difficult for pedestrians to cross). <p> Neighborhood Bikeability Score( **38;13197;TOOLONG) is a rating from 0( worst) to 100( best) that indicates the number of destinations( stores, schools, parks, etc.) that can be reached within a 20-minute bike ride, taking into account the quality of cycling infrastructure( McNeil 2010). <h> Shared-Use Path Level-Of-Service Ratings <p> The U.S. Federal Highway Administration( FHWA, 2006) developed a Shared-Use Path LOS( SUPLOS) model, which is a mathematical formula that uses select inputs describing conditions along a trail to calculate an LOS score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation of path traffic flow theory, an extensive effort to collect data on path operations, and a survey during which path users expressed their degree of satisfaction with the paths shown on a series of videos. <p> The resulting method requires minimal input and produces a simple and useful result. The method requires only four inputs from the user : One-way user volume in the design hour, mode split percentages, trail width, and presence or absence of a centerline. Factors involved in the estimation of an LOS for a path include the number of times a typical bicyclist meets or passes another path user and the number of those passes that are delayed. The method considers five types of path users when calculating adult bicyclists ' LOS, including other adult bicyclists, child bicyclists, pedestrians, runners, and in-line skaters. The FHWA provides step-by-step instructions on how to use the LOS procedure and spreadsheet calculation tool. <p> The basic SUPLOS model equation is( see the guidebook for more detailed information and cautions on using this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15.86(RW) -- 0.287(CL) --( DPF) <p> Where : <p> E = Events = Meetings per minute + 10( active passes per minute) <p> RW = Reciprocal of path width( i.e., 1/path width, in feet) <p> CL = 1 if trail has a centerline, 0 if trail has no centerline <p> DPF = Delayed pass factor <p> The SUPLOS model generates a LOS score between zero and five. <p> The resulting SUPLOS scale can be converted to letter grades. An A is the highest score, excellent, and an F is the lowest score. <p> Table 8 lists factors to consider when evaluating Public Transit service quality. These rating factors can be adjusted as needed for various locations, types of trips and users. For example, Transit Level-of-Service can be rated for a particular geographic area or location, such as a neighborhood or worksite ; for a particular type of trip, such as commuting or travel to medical services ; and for particular users, such as commuters and visitors. <p> Accommodation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs. <p> Accommodation of people with special needs in transit vehicles, stations and station areas. <p> Ability to carry baggage. <p> Ability to accommodate people who can not read or understand the local language. <p> User information <p> Ease of obtaining user information. <p> Availability, accuracy and understandability of route, schedule and fare information, at stops, stations, destinations ; by Internet and mobile telephone ; and by transit agency staff and other information providers. <p> Real-time transit vehicle arrival information. <p> Information available for people with special needs( audio or visual disabilities, inability to read or understand the local language, etc.) <p> Courtesy and responsiveness <p> Courtesy with which passengers are treated. <p> How passengers are treated by transit staff. <p> Ease of filing a complaint. <p> Agency responsiveness to complaints. <p> Attractiveness <p> The attractiveness of public transit facilities. <p> Attractiveness of vehicles and facilities. <p> Attractiveness of documents and websites. <p> Livability( environmental and social quality of an area) of transit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors to consider when evaluating public transport services. <p> Several walking and cycling Level-Of-Service rating systems have been developed. Some are more complete than others, as summarized in Table 9. Newer indices tend to be more comprehensive and therefore more accurate at evaluating service quality and predicting the effects of changes in transit service and accessibility. <p> Table 9 Transit Indices Compared( Fu, Saccomanno and Xin 2005) <p> Indices <p> Studies <p> Performance Factors Incorporated <p> Reflects <p> Transit Availability? <p> Reflects Comfort and Convenience? <p> Reflects Travel Demand? <p> Local Index of Transit Availability <p> Rood, 1997 <p> Frequency ; capacity ; route coverage <p> Yes <p> No <p> No <p> Public Transportation Accessibility Level <p> Hillman, <p> Service frequency ; service coverage <p> Yes <p> No <p> No <p> Transit Level of Service Indicator <p> Kittelson &; Associates and <p> URS, 2001 <p> Service coverage ; frequency ; service span ; population ; jobs <p> Yes <p> No <p> Yes <p> Transit Service Accessibility Index <p> Polzin et al., 2002 <p> Service coverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> No <p> Total number of trips <p> Mobility Index <p> Galindez and Mireles- Cordov, 1999 <p> Travel speed ; average vehicle occupancy <p> No <p> Yes <p> No <p> Service Quality Index <p> Hensher et al., 2001 <p> 13 variables( i.e., travel time ; frequency, etc.) <p> Yes <p> No <p> Yes <p> Transit Service Indicator( TSI) <p> Fu, Saccomanno and Xin, 2005 <p> Service frequency, coverage, and various travel time components( walk, wait, transfer, and ride) <p> Yes <p> Yes <p> Yes <p> This table compares various indices that can be used to evaluate service quality and predict the effects of service changes. <p> This table indicates the level-of-service ratings and crowding factors for various passenger densities. Crowding factors are multipliers relative to in-vehicle time cost values. This indicates, for example, that at 1.0 passengers per square meter, waiting time is 1.14 times in-vehicle travel time values, and walking time is 1.50 in-vehicle travel time. <h> Other Levels-Of-Service Indicators <p> Below are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <h> Ridesharing <p> Ridesharing( carpooling and vanpooling) consists of travelers who share a vehicle, making use of otherwise unoccupied seats.

Availability of subsidies and discounts for people with special needs( such as disabilities) and other frequent users. <p> Vehicle comfort and cleanliness. <p> Driver and dispatcher courtesy. <p> Safety. <p> Number of user complaints. <h> How it is Implemented <p> Multi-Modal Level-of-Service standards are generally established by transportation organizations, such as the Transportation Research Board and the Institute of Transportation Engineers, formally adopted by transportation agencies and jurisdictions, and applied to individual transportation professionals, particularly transport planners and engineers. They are applied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finance policies and priorities, and by facility designers. Multi-modal <p> There are several steps in developing and applying such indicators : <p> Define quantifiable indicators. This involves identifying a reasonable set of indicators, suitable for quantification, that reflect various types of user impacts, such as speed, convenience, comfort and safety( examples are described in the following section). <p> Determine quantification methods. This is usually done by experts, based on surveys to help determine user needs and preferences. For example, speed may be measured in average kilometers-per-hour, crowding in people per square meter, and security in assaults per million passenger trips. <p> Collect data. This may involve using existing data( such as vehicle traffic speeds), collecting new data( such as transit station crowding), or special user surveys to rate the quality of certain facilities and services. <p> Integrate results into an index. Individual indicators can be combined into an index. For example, several indicators reflecting various impacts( speed, convenience, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a numerical value into a letter grade. Some indicators may be considered more important than others and so should receive more weight. <h> Travel Impacts <p> Adoptions and application of Multi-Modal LOS standards can help create a more multi-modal transport system, resulting in reduced automobile travel and increased use of alternative modes. Impacts vary, depending on specific conditions, but large reductions in automobile travel are possible if improved transportation planning analysis leads to significant improvements in alternative mode service quality. <h> Benefits And Costs <p> Application of Multi-Modal Level-of-Service Indicators contributes toward the development of an efficient, multi-modal transport system, which helps achieve virtually all TDM benefits. Multi-Modal LOS indictors help create more Sustainable transportation by incorporating more impacts and modes into the planning process. <h> Applications <p> Multi-Modal LOS standards can be developed and implemented by virtually all transportation planning organizations. It is particularly important in large urban areas where more multi-modal transportation planning is particularly beneficial. <h> Stakeholders <p> Stakeholders primarily consist of various government agencies involved in transportation Planning and Operations, plus anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Barriers To Implementation <p> Major barriers to Multi-Modal Level-of-Service implementation include limited experience with such practices, and funding practices that favor roadway capacity expansion over management solutions. Change Management is generally required to help practitioners incorporate these ideas. <h> Best Practices <p> The following are general guidelines for developing Multi-Modal Level-Of-Service standards : <p> Use existing Multi-Modal Level-of-Service indicators, and modify them to reflect the needs of a particular situation. <p> Avoid oversimplifying the indicators. Incorporate enough factors to accurately reflect the variety of problems that users may face, including comfort, convenience, security and affordability. <p> For Equity analysis, evaluate the quality of service experienced by various types of users, particularly those who are economically, physically or socially disadvantaged. <p> Consult with users to determine the factors that they consider important when creating LOS rating systems. <h> Case Studies and Examples <p> The Florida Department of Transportation has adopted multi-modal Level-of-Service( LOS) standards. These standards provide a method of measuring highway performance for use in prioritizing transportation projects and land-use planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of techniques and analysis tools for calculating LOS and applying it to specific planning decisions, including the Quality/Level of Service Handbook, LOS evaluation software, and an ongoing research and professional development program to support development and implementation of these tools. <p> The report, A Healthy City Is An Active City : A Physical Activity Planning Guide( Edwards and Tsouros, 2008) includes various checklists that can be used to evaluate how well a particular community accommodates and encourages active transportation( walking and cycling) and other healthy community features. <p> Relative Transit Mobility( RTM), the relative speed by which journey-to-work trips can be made via transit travel as compared to auto travel <p> PAMR uses the regional metropolitan planning organization travel demand model to forecast conditions for a horizon year that includes previously approved development( the " pipeline ") countywide and regional growth and transportation projects funded in the next four fiscal years. The RTM and transit level of service( LOS) is established for each zone( called policy areas). @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecasted transit LOS and the RAM. For areas with adequate RAM, applicants need take no action under PAMR. For policy areas where relative arterial mobility is insufficient applicants must support the following mitigation actions : <p> In the report, Build for Comfort, Not Just Speed : Valuing Service Quality Impacts In Transport Planning, Litman( 2007) describes how to use Level-of-Service ratings to adjust travel time values to reflect the degree of discomfort experienced by users of a particular mode, as summarized in Table 15. For example, if wages average $12.00 per hour, a drivers ' time is valued at $6.00 per hour under LOS A to C, but increases to $8.00 per hour under LOS D, $10.00 per hours under LOS E, and $12.00 per hour under LOS F conditions. Similarly, unit travel time costs for transit passengers, pedestrians and cyclists increase as their LOS rating decline. This system does not specify exactly how walking, cycling and public transit Level-of-Service is quantified ; it is up to practioners to select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values that incorporate traveler convenience and comfort factors.( * Wait time unit costs are reduced another 20-30% where real-time vehicle arrival information is provided.) <h> City of Orlando Development Fee Structure( Orlando 1998) <p> As is common in rapidly-growing jurisdictions, the city of Orlando charges development fees to help recover the costs of accommodating additional vehicle traffic generated by new buildings. Starting in 1998 the city has adjusted those fees to reflect the lower vehicle-miles generated by developments in more multi-modal locations. For example, a multi-family housing unit located in the downtown area is charged a $374 fee, compared with an $807 if in an automobile-dependent location. Similarly, a small retail building would be charged a fee of $2,659 per 1,000 square feet of floor area if located downtown, but $4,647 if located in a more automobile-dependent location. <h> Austin Transportation User Fees <p> Austin, Texas( www.ci.austin.tx.us) utility bills include a Transportation User Fee( TUF) based on the average number of motor vehicle trips generated per property, reflecting its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. For example, single-family development is estimated to generate 40 motor vehicle trips per acre per day, condominium residential use and townhouse residential use generate approximately 60 motor vehicle trips per acre per day, and offices generate approximately 180 motor vehicle trips per acre per day. The charge averages $30 to $40 annually for a typical household. The city provides exemptions to residential properties with occupants that do not own or regularly use a private motor vehicle for transportation, or if the user is 65 years of age or older. <h> Fort Collins, Colorado <p> A special Multimodal Transportation Level of Service Manual is used in Fort Collins and nearby urban areas to evaluate accessibility, connectivity and continuity of various modes. The city established varying minimal acceptable levels of service( LOS) depending on street classification and land use. These standards range from LOS B on connectors in low-density, mixed residential areas, to LOS E on arterials in commercial corridors and mixed-use districts. Pedestrian and bicycling LOS standards take into account directness, continuity, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedestrian and cycling facilities. Specific pedestrian LOS standards are established for transit corridors and around schools. <p> The City of San Francisco has used the Highway Capacity Manual ' s Level of Service( LOS) intersection delay measure to evaluate the transportation impacts of new developments. However, this tends to contradict the city 's efforts to encourage compact, infill development, in support of its Transit First policy. Although such development may reduce nearby roadway LOS ratings in the short term, this is offset by improved accessibility and improvements to transit, bicycling, and walking conditions. <p> Hiatt, Ferrell and Letunic( 2008) describe the San Francisco County Transportation Authority 's effort to define a transport impact analysis measure based on the volume of auto trips generated by a project. Potential " thresholds of significance " -- the points at which the volume of auto trips generated by a proposed project constitutes a significant negative environmental impact -- are described. The thresholds under consideration are based on the effects of auto traffic on mobility, quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other factors. The near term objective of the effort is to forward a new measure and threshold for adoption by the City for environmental impacts analysis purposes. In the longer term, the measure could provide a basis for a transportation impact fee. <p> The Authority is encouraging the City to replace LOS with a measure based on the number of automobile trips generated by a proposed project. Projects that generate no net new automobile trips would not be considered to have transportation impacts under CEQA. Projects that do generate automobile trips would be able to mitigate their impacts by paying a new transportation impact mitigation fee that would fund a set of citywide and local area projects designed to address environmental impacts caused by the project. This approach is a better indicator of environmental effect than LOS ; it is consistent with the City 's Transit First policy and other environmental and health goals ; it is more efficient and transparent for the Planning Department to implement and for project sponsors to understand ; and it is a more effective approach to transportation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ATG measure and TIMF program by the City, and proposes that the Authority partner with City agencies on the initiation of a nexus study to support the new program. Table 15 summarizes a portion of the study 's analysis of the relationships between Average Trips Generated( ATG) and various impacts. <p> Table 16 Links between ATG and Effects on the Environment( SFCTA, 2008) <p> Published studies correlating automobile volumes / miles with collision rate or risk.
