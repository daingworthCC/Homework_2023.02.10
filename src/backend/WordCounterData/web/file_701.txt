So, every time I 've had a girl give me her number, I 've inevitably ended up requesting her to text mine real quick... <p>... and this whole time, it was acting as a kind of " real number " filter! They had no choice but to text me their real number, I was right in front of her! <p>.... just a thought, maybe you guys might find it useful. Tell them your phone is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to text you first! <p> I once gave a wrong number to a girl while I was visiting China. She was way too annoying so I did n't want to bother texting with her. <p> Cool trick and all, but whats the point? If you 're given a wrong number, it means she 's not interested to begin with But unless you 're afraid she has n't seen your " true colors " and what not, then I guess it 's understandable. <p> Look. It 's simple. If a girl really liked you, she would be eager to give you her real number in any case. <p> If a girl is politely giving you a fake number just to get you off her back, it 's a sign that she DOES NOT LIKE YOU in any case. What 's the point of going to such lengths to pressure a girl to give you her number if she does n't even like you? <p> Forcing her to reveal what her true number is will probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl is politely giving you a fake number just to get you off her back, it 's a sign that she DOES NOT LIKE YOU in any case. What 's the point of going to such lengths to pressure a girl to give you her number if she does n't even like you? <p> To make a fool out of her since she probably lies and plays phony mind-games all the time for no reason. She 'd probably be shocked that she did n't get away with it for once too. <p> I 'd probably just laugh at her for trying to give a fake-number, and not even ask for the real one. <p> By the Gods, if the NT women did n't play them, I would n't even know how to! <p> Quote : <p> Look. It 's simple. If a girl really liked you, she would be eager to give you her real number in any case. <p> It 's honestly my thoughts on the matter, but people I know have managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out before. I bet a lot of the time they do it simply because they 're unsure and wanted to take the " safe route ". <p> edit With further thought, I bet it could also be used as a way to determine " Yup she definitely did n't like me, time to move on ". <p> Not that I have exchanged numbers in this context, but I thought it was customary for one person to give their number and then get a missed call/text from the other person( so only one number needs entered into the phone). This way the number is verified( against innocent errors as well as deliberate acts). <p> Even if I did get somebodies number I would have great difficulty making the first call. <p> If a girl wants to give me her number, she 'll ask me. I say ok and whip out my phone, then I pretend I type it in - or deliberately delete it afterwards if I was spectated. <p> I never give out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask girls for their number. Heck, I never even approach girls in the first place. Actually, I downright ignore their presence unless it 's unavoidable. When superficiality takes control of your reality, you are already lost in the sea of normality. <p> If a girl is politely giving you a fake number just to get you off her back, it 's a sign that she DOES NOT LIKE YOU in any case.

It 's unfortunate for those who are sending out the wrong signals inadvertantly, but if it 's a choice between lying and risking your personal safety, which would you choose?
