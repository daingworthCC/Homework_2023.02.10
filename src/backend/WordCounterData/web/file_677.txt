The kids, dressed up for their big day, would wave tiny American flags -- which, as the lyrics proclaim, " still stand for freedom. " <p> But Hawkins marched in on a recent rehearsal and ordered a CD playing the anthem to be shut off, staffers said. <p> She told the teachers to drop the song from the program. <p> " We do n't want to offend other cultures, " they quoted her as explaining. <p> The curt edict stunned both staff and parents. <p> " A lot of people fought to move to America to live freely, so that song should be sung with a whole lot of pride, " said mom Luz Lozada, whose son, Daniel, is in kindergarten. <p> The song has been sung at previous school events. Last year 's fifth-graders, including another Lozada child, performed it at graduation. <p> " Everybody applauded and whistled, " the mom said. " They gave it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It makes them a little goosebumpy and teary-eyed. I 've never come across anyone who felt it insulted their culture. " <p> Department of Education spokeswoman Jessica Scaperotti gave The Post an explanation staffers said they never heard -- that Hawkins found the lyrics " too grown up " for 5-year-olds. <p> The song starts : " If tomorrow all the things were gone, I 'd worked for all my life. And I had to start again, with just my children and my wife, I 'd thank my lucky stars, to be livin ' here today. " <p> Scaperotti said the department supports the principal 's decision. " The lyrics are not age-appropriate, " she said. <p> But Justin Bieber 's flirty song about teen romance, " Baby, " was deemed a fine selection for the show. Hawkins had no problem with 5-year-olds singing lines such as, " Are we an item? Girl, quit playing. " <p> The other songs : " We 're All Together Again, " popular at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which celebrates diversity ; " Shake Your Sillies Out " by Raffi ; and " You 've Got a Friend in Me " from " Toy Story. " <p> Scaperotti noted PS 90 kids recite the Pledge of Allegiance and sing " America the Beautiful " each morning. Insiders say Hawkins tried to end that tradition a couple years ago but staff objected. <p> The principal, a Jehovah 's Witness, does not recite the pledge because her religion forbids followers to salute any nation 's flag. Staffers gripe she does n't stand in respect during the school-wide ritual. <p> The song uproar comes amid tensions. Hawkins has been called a tyrant and bully by some staffers. <p> The DOE reprimanded her in 2010 after teachers complained she called the school " racist " and declared : " I 'm black. Your previous principal was white and Jewish. More of us are coming. " <p> Scaperotti said Hawkins is being targeted by the teachers union and has received hate
