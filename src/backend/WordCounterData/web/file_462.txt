5073041 in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.( Declaration of Independence, 1776) <p> We affirm these self-evident truths, and declare that it is time to abolish our form of government, not by armed revolution, but by the election of representatives who will change it. <p> The Constitution of the United States allows for the people to elect their representatives every two years, and to elect every senator every six, and to elect the president every four. Each state constitution allows the citizens of that state a similar power to choose their government. Through electing representatives that represent our desire to preserve our government solely to protect the individual rights of everyone, we propose the following changes be made. <p> Limited government. Our governments are limited by the constitutions that form them. We need to enact a common understanding among the people of what those limits are and impose them on our governments. We need also to strengthen the already existing limits, overturning bad interpretations by our courts, legislators, and executives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will forever ensure our individual liberty. <p> Dramatic cuts to spending. Our governments should spend our money procuring only those goods and services that will protect our rights. <p> An end to government charity. It is the role of our churches and the individual to supply charity to the poor, not the state. If the individual and churches can not supply the charity, government could only do worse. Having government provide charity absolved the conscience and duty of the people from their proper role to love their neighbor. <p> An end to unfunded legislation. Any program that congress enacts must be completely and fully funded at the time of its creation. We will not enslave future generations to programs that we create but do not fully fund. Existing programs that are unfunded should be canceled or modified until they can be funded. <p> Dramatic cuts to taxation. Our governments should collect far less taxes than the people can bear. The people should be free to pursue whatever economic matter they wish without burden or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to punish the rich or to mold society 's behavior. They should only be used to raise the necessary money to meet the spending requirements of a government that protects the rights of the individual. Any surpluses should be immediately refunded to the people in proportion to taxes paid, or used to pay off debts. Taxes should never be raised to meet spending ; rather, spending should be cut to meet tax revenue. <p> An end to government debt. Our people have become more prosperous than any other people in the world. We do not need to borrow money anymore to provide for the needs of government. Paying interest on our government debts is slavery, not freedom. We are not free until we have paid off all of our debts. Any debt that we must incur should be paid off within a very short time frame, so that our debts are not repaid by our children. <p> An end to bureaucratic regulation. Any kind of regulation must be debated and passed by the legislatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public official should be allowed to set policy that governs the life of anyone but their own employees. No court should dictate legislation. No executive should issue orders except to his troops and employees. Anyone exceeding these limits should immediately be removed from office by impeachment because they are a threat to our liberty. <p> An end to over-litigation. The laws of our country are unjust, in that they are used to punish those who have done no wrong with tort laws and allow the criminal to go free. Let our laws be simple and just so that we no longer have need of lawyers. Do not allow our constitution to be interpreted as giving shelter to the guilty or limiting the freedoms of the individual. <p> We boldly declare that freedom and liberty are dramatically different than tyranny and slavery. In a free society, government works differently than in an enslaved society. Our governments should be eternally fearful of the will of the people, forever locked in by the limits of the constitution which creates them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual and as a whole. <p> We emphatically reject the tenets of communism, socialism, fascism, totalitarianism, colonialism, and every other form of government or political idea that sets one person above another, that limits the freedom of the individual for the " greater good ", or attempts to convince any individual that they have no rights or fewer rights than the rights man is endowed with by their Creator. <p> We boldly declare that in our society, the checks and balances in our government includes the individual, private organizations such as businesses or churches or political groups, and federated governments such as the local, state, and federal governments. By distributing the power to govern among these people, organizations, and governments, no one person or group of people is able to obtain much power over the rest. <p> We also declare that there is enough in this world, and to spare, if the individual is freed from the constraints of government to seek his own fortune in life. We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of providing charity to the poor, jobs to those who want them, and also to pursue the critical role of participating in politics to keep government constrained. We encourage all men, everywhere, to embrace their freedom, seek their own fortunes, and once having obtained it, spend their time and resources as they see fit in service to their fellowman, without the entanglement of government. <p> The Government, in my mind, is the most fearsome monster ever imagined. <p> To understand why, you need to understand why we have government at all, and why government should instead be called " Community Violence. " <p> Governments form to fight wars and rid the world of evil. We count on our government to blow up the bad guys before they blow us up. We count on them to find and catch and prosecute the criminals. <p> When governments turn to do harm to the people, where are the people supposed to turn for protection? <p> Our country started with the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people, when they begin to infringe on those very rights, it should be altered or abolished. That 's what compelled the Founding Fathers to rebel against England. <p> Most rebellions end up with a worse government than the one they started with. France 's rebellion of the same time period is certainly a case. So our Founding Fathers thought long and hard about what kind of government would not only preserve our freedom, but be superior to the system that the English had set up. <p> They settled on a government with strict limitations. Community violence could be used, they wrote and explained, but only in certain cases. <p> Our governments of today have exceeded all reasonable bounds. We are no longer free, not when you compare our freedom with that of our ancestors. Government controls every aspect of our lives. It controls what we are free to eat or do, what kind of businesses we can run and what kinds of things we can talk about. It has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyranny we are experience, but we can not deny it any longer. <p> What would freedom look like? Quite different than what we have. <p> Rather than turning to gangs, poor minorities would be starting businesses doing all sorts of things. From the minority who wants to braid hair, to the kid who wants to shine shoes, to any number of menial businesses that require no education at all to run successfully, the poor minorities could be active participants in our economy. Instead, there are roadblocks from every government agency. You 'd need an advanced college degree even to start your business. Trust me, I know, I tried. I was unable to navigate the mountains of regulations. Not for lack of trying, of course. <p> Police forces would disappear. People would be called upon to defend their own property and lives, and each others. Gangs would n't be a problem. You see, if a gangmember threatened your business, you would form an ad hoc militia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your guns. Despite all the movies to the contrary, life in the " Wild West " was really quite peaceful. Crime was rare. <p> The laws would be much different. Even schoolchildren would be able to figure out what is and is not legal. You would n't need a lawyer to go to trial, except in rare cases. In fact, most issues would be settled outside of court. Our litigious society would quickly turn to self-reconciliation. <p> Elections would be different. Anyone could say or do anything they wanted, with any funds they wanted to use. There would n't need to be any reporting of any kind, since there is no legal requirement to report the exercise of your free speech rights. <p> The medical system would be different. Employers probably would n't offer health insurance, since you probably would n't want health insurance. The costs of health care would be so low, thanks to the elimination of all regulations and taxes, that you would be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, expensive treatment would, of course, be only available to the richest among us. But as with everything in a free economy, it is n't long before costs drop and supply increases. After all, if I were a drug company, I would rather sell a drug that $10 million people would use for $100 than 100 people would use for a $1 million. <p> What about crime, fraud, corruption? A free society protects itself against these things rather easily. Normally, these types of people aggregate to institutions of power. Case in point, the global warming movement. There is absolutely no weight behind any of their absurd claims, and yet here we are. Why? Because they are working through government. If they had to instead compete in the free market of ideas, we would 've recognized and rejected their baseless allegations immediately. <p> When we turn to Community Violence to provide social services, we are asking the fox to guard the henhouse. Government tends to attract people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking our money, spending it on the poor, and then claiming credit for it. The only way to eliminate this kind of abuse is to stop the practice altogether. Government should be for those people who want to hurt and kill bad guys who threaten our freedoms. Let the churches and societies care about the poor. <p> It seems odd that my first post about explaining conservative principles targets the libertarian viewpoint rather than the liberal one. But this is the core critical principle behind everything else we believe. <p> Conservatives and Libertarians agree that men are free to choose. To the conservative, this is God 's ultimate gift to mankind. To the libertarian, this is a fact of nature. <p> The conservative believes one thing that is in conflict with the libertarian : We believe we are free to do good. Namely, that our freedom expands when we do right, and contracts when we do wrong. <p> If I choose to eat healthy, exercise, and not do things like drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as healthy as it could be. I will be able to work long hours. I will be able to play and recreate outdoors. I will be able to wrestle with my kids. My mind will be as clear as I can expect it to ever be. My economic contributions will help other people improve their economic situation. My contributions to family life will help build a stronger society. There is a lot of good that will come of it. <p> If I choose to eat junk food, slob around, drink heavily and smoke, then my physical body will not be as healthy as it could be. I will not be as great a benefit for society as I otherwise could be. There is an opportunity cost to myself and society by doing this, meaning good things that would have otherwise happened will not happen. <p> Now, I 'm not saying that government should regulate what we eat and how we spend our time. We 'll talk about what the government should do or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that conservatives do not think the freedom to do what we like includes the freedom to eat junk food, slob around, drink heavily and smoke. That is, if we choose to do those things, we 're doing wrong, and we know it even though many do it. <p> The libertarian might believe that it really does n't matter what I do with myself, as long as I do n't hurt others. They often forget that by reducing your economic ability, you are hurting others. Even private actions, such as engaging in extra-marital relations or smoking a joint have long-term and expensive costs to society. <p> Thus, when God gave man freedom, it came with strings attached. If we choose to do good, then our freedom expands. We can choose to do more things. If we choose to do evil, then our freedom contracts. We will have fewer choices later on. <p> This core principle, the strings that are attached to our freedom, is our moral duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are free, we say that you are NOT free to do everything. There is a sort of contract between you and God and society, and it reads something like this : <p> God gives you freedom and life <p> Society promises to not interfere with most things <p> You promise to use your freedoms wisely, for the benefit of yourself and mankind. <p> Now, let 's talk about where our liberties end. <p> Libertarians are right : actions which directly harm people are prohibited. Mostly. The basic rule is found in the Mosaic Law : eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth. If you hurt your neighbor 's eye, you must restore that eye or you must pay a penalty of the eye, etc... This is the basic idea behind our tort laws, which can be traced back to the Bible. This is also why it makes a whole lot of sense to charge polluters for the cost of cleanup, and then allow them to pollute anyway. <p> Libertarians forget that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We have a duty to protect ourselves, our family, and each other from those who would violate our liberties. <p> We have a duty to use our liberties for our benefit and the benefit of others. <p> We have a duty to provide for our own food and shelter and wants, rather than relying on others to do so. <p> We ALSO have a duty to help others provide for themselves, not to make them dependent or lazy, but to help them obtain the means to obtain their own support( more on this in a later post). <p> Conservatives understand where the freedom to do as we please ends and where we are " enslaved " to our liberties through out duties. We cheerfully and happily accept our duties as a small price to pay for our liberties. Some examples include : <p> Soldiers who volunteer to fight so others do n't have to. People who pay their taxes knowing it is used to support those soldiers. <p> Business owners who pay their taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for themselves, their business partners, their customers and competitors. <p> Individuals who pay their taxes, knowing it funds the legal system which protects their individual rights. <p> Individuals who give away their time, talents, and resources without expectation of remuneration, so that others can enjoy a better life. <p> Churches which stand up for moral issues, such as the sanctity of marriage and the protection of unborn life. <p> Organizations formed, without expectation of profit, so that people can learn or develop talents of their own. <p> Unfortunately, liberties and duties are not simple. It takes careful study and thought to understand how and why charity is a critical component of capitalism, pacificism requires a military, etc... We could spend our entire lives studying our rights and duties and never come to a complete understanding of them. <p> Nevertheless, we ALL have a duty to understand our rights and duties for ourselves. If we do not understand them, we will fail in our duties and lose our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run a campaign against the conservative. Case in point, never once did Obama take on Romney 's conservatism. Why? He knew it would make him lose. Instead, he attacked Big Bird, " binders full of women " and " vote for your lady parts. " Oh, and " Romney 's a liar ". Never once did Obama try to show how conservatism was wrong. Why? It ca n't be done. You sound stupid when you try to do it in America. " You did n't build that. " <p> Second, all those people who say the Republican Party should move left are full of stupidity. We did n't lose because we did n't get enough moderate or liberal votes. We lost because 100,000 republicans in swing states decided they did not want to vote this time around. Had we encouraged them to vote, they would have, and probably a lot more than 100,000. There is no reason why we could n't have the numbers Bush had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2008, we would have won. <p> Third, the left is utterly powerless. What I mean by this is that they must run a particular campaign if they expect to get any votes at all. Obama 's campaign was about as pathetic as you can get, and yet, he still earned 10 million fewer votes than he got last time around. It 's laughable, really. They have worked themselves into an ever-shrinking box. Our friends keep getting richer and smarter and have more kids. Their supporters get drugged up, die young, and do n't have kids. We have the demographic advantage. They 've already slaughtered millions of potential voters, and as time goes on, that gap, the abortion gap, is growing, because those aborted babies will never have children of their own. That 's what happens when you embrace the ideology of death rather than life. Your people end up dead. <p> This homosexual marriage thing : I have half a mind to let them try it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depressed, end up committing suicide or killing each other or getting some awful disease and dying. Their values will die out in 1 or 2 generations, tops. Meanwhile, us who believe in and practice traditional marriage will raise bright, happy minds who will raise bright happy minds etc... If you really disagree with homosexual marriage, you will be the best parent possible and have as many kids as you can to put your money where your mouth is. <p> And the entitlement mentality! They have hit a point where too many people ask for too much for government. Medicare is bankrupt. So is social security. So are the welfare programs. If your political power depends on giving people free stuff, and you run out of free stuff, you lose your political power. <p> Fourth, whatever we do, we must NEVER compromise our core values of conservatism. We must NEVER give an inch, NEVER agree with any statist ideas, NEVER fear the outcome. When they mock and insult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe, and why you believe it. You do n't have to become little and tiny like they are. You can still use logic and reason and point out their logical fallacies and contradictions and remain civil. <p> Fifth, there are more than enough republicans and conservatives to win any national election handily. How do I know this? Because conservatives across the country got elected to the House, while Romney did not. This means the conservative banner marched forward, over the liberal banner, even though we lost the big race. Think about what that means for a moment. <p> I 'm going to be talking more about conservative values and why they are the only values you can have if you care about people. I 'll be explaining why statism kills, the murder kind of kill, not the executing criminals or fighting a war kind of killing. You 're going to see people 's lives ruined thanks to the statist policies of the Obama administration over the next four years. <p> By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to elect the most conservative person we can find as presidential nominee. If we ca n't get the Republican Party nomination, then we 're going to start a third party. Why? Because we WILL NOT win if we get behind a moderately conservative candidate. That argument simply can not be made any more. If we split the vote three ways, so be it. That 's how Lincoln won. Remember, it was the Whigs( ending slavery is too risky and makes people unhappy), the Democrats( slavery or bust!) and the Republicans( we 're not going to tolerate slavery for 1 more second). Except now we have our moderate republicans( oh, we need to get the moderates to vote for us), the democrats( statism or bust!) and the conservatives( end statism right now!). <p> Our job is not to convince the left or the moderate to vote for us. We honestly do n't need their vote. They are too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if we earned their vote, it would mean we 're pretty stupid too. We could spend all our time explaining to them what needs to be done, but they are not going to listen to us anyway. I mean, these people are beyond logic and reason. So let 's forget about them, because they are a minority anyway. Let 's focus on getting conservatives to vote enthusiastically for conservatives. Those people in our country who know how to think will find us eventually, and then recognize the truth for what it is. We do n't need to work on people who are n't looking for truth anyway. <p> Atheists are launching a new media campaign against Mormons. This time, they are supposing we practice some bizarre form of segregation based on one 's sexual orientation or skin color.( link) <p> As I posted earlier, if there is a faith that is chock full of contradiction and misinformation, it is the Atheist one. Here they are showing their ignorance, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two simple observations : The Mormon Church has always welcomed blacks, and the Mormon church has always welcomed homosexuals. <p> For the record, we accept anyone from any background into our faith. It is contrary to our doctrine to deny anyone access to the Lord 's blessings based on anything but their worthiness. For the dead, we do n't even care about their worthiness. <p> On the history of black relations with our church, I propose two points. One, that we never taught that blacks would not receive the highest levels of salvation. In fact, our religion was the first in modern history to point out that all the blacks who died without knowing Christ would have an opportunity to join all the faithful Saints in heaven. Two, Joseph Smith 's Nauvoo city was part of the underground railroad, helping runaway slaves in material ways. It does n't take much effort to find stories of Joseph Smith offering his own bed, his money, his property, to help black people in Nauvoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, that they were no different from whites, was truly radical in his time. It is still a truly radical concept for many. <p> As for the ban on the priesthood, when it was instituted, it was understood to be temporary, and at the same time, it would not limit any black person 's ability to progress and receive the saving ordinances and be exalted along with the whites. Similar bans on the priesthood are recorded in the Bible, such as limiting who is allowed to officiate in the temple, etc... <p> On the topic of homosexuality, we do not discriminate. Sexual relations outside of marriage is a sin, no matter the sexes of those involved. To those who have proclivities to violate themselves in such a way, they must follow God 's counsel to cross themselves, to learn to tame their flesh. We believe that Jesus Christ can help people overcome their sins, not just by paying the price for their sins so they need not suffer the consequences, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to sin. Given that fact, we do not consider homosexuals to be any different from us. We are a all sinners, and all of us need that change of heart to turn us into new people, reborn through Christ, whose hearts have no desire to sin but to do what God wants all the time. In fact, we teach that the smallest sin will keep one out of heaven, along with the greatest sin. Murderers and paperclip thieves are grouped together, along with liars and adulterers and every other form of sinner. <p> It is apparent that this ad campaign is intended to deceive people into believing that which is not true. Is it any wonder that this deception comes from the Atheists? Here we have a " religion " whose primary deception is found in their first article of faith : God does not exist. How can they know it? The simple fact is that it is impossible to disprove the existence of something, let alone the existence of a supernatural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for they assume, illogically, that the absence of evidence is evidence of absence. When confronted with this fact, they squirm and suppose a different idea altogether : That those who have personally come to know God and Christ are liars or mentally sick, even though both are easily verifiable and provably false in many cases.( Yes, some Christians are liars, and others are mentally ill. But that is certainly not true for all of them.) <p> This charge of discriminatory practices is hardly comparable to the charges that we have horns in our head, that we steal babies, that we steal young women, that we eat human flesh, or that we are plotting to overthrow the world 's governments. We are well familiar with blood libel, as well as the effects of it, which occasionally results in murder. We watched people come into our communities, rape and murder us, steal our property, throw us off of our land, deny us the right to vote or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or do all manner of vicious things, often in the name of righteousness or justice. Let the Atheists cast their lots with the mobs that tried to destroy our religion from the beginning. At least we know the end of their efforts, because we have seen it time and again. <p> The way we counter these charges is to live our lives honestly and without fear. Let 's tell people what we really believe. Let 's let them see into our homes and personal lives. Let 's be a light to this world as we always have been. <p> Now that Romney is just about to be elected president, several anti-Mormon videos are sweeping the internets. Among them are likely videos that reveal what happens in our most sacred temple ordinances. <p> Feel free to watch them. Understand the level of dishonesty that was required to obtain them, however. Someone must have been a member of the church in good standing for at least a year. They must have made sacred covenants with God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several people about their intentions. They must have violated basic rules to not film or reveal key portions of the ceremony. Finally, during the ceremony, they swore an oath to God that they would not reveal certain tokens or signs. And yet, here we are. <p> If you want to trust such a person to accurately portray mormonism, then you are free to do so. However, to me, such a dishonest person has no reason to be trusted at all. Why would anyone trust someone who takes oaths before God so lightly, or who is willing to deceive so many people? <p> Regardless, I am going to share with you the " gory " details about what goes on in Mormon temples. I feel now is just as an appropriate time as any. <p> To put things in perspective, you have to understand how Mormons view the universe. <p> First, there is a God. He is our loving Father in Heaven. His primary purpose is to prepare us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him. <p> He provided for us a Savior, Jesus Christ. Under the direction of Jesus Christ, the world was created, and man was place on it. Adam and Eve ate the fruit, and brought sin and death into the world. <p> However, this was anticipated from the beginning. The very purpose of life is to experience sin and death in this mortal realm. Having experienced that, we are to repent and obey Jesus Christ, who will show us how to get out of the mess we have created for ourselves. Our obedience to Jesus Christ is that we sacrifice ourselves to show love to each other. It is that we feed the hungry, clothe the naked, shelter the homeless, tend to the sick, and help the sinner and comfort those who stand in need of comfort. This is pretty much the entirety of what we are asked to do, in addition to inward actions such as trusting Jesus and repenting of our sins. <p> As tokens or signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinance of baptism. This symbolically washes us from our sins, and symbolically represents a rebirth in God 's kingdom. Then we receive the ordinance of the laying on of hands for the Gift of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost can be our constant companion, helping us know what we should do to follow Jesus 's example on the earth. These are two saving ordinances, meaning, we can not return to Heavenly Father without receiving them. <p> The problem is that so many people lived on earth but never received baptism. Many of them never even had a chance to receive baptism. So Jesus provided a way for all those hosts of the dead to be on equal footing with the most righteous of saints. We can be baptized in their behalf in our temples. We can offer them the ordinance of baptism and the Gift of the Holy Ghost, which they are free to receive if they so desire. <p> Since we believe that free will pre-dates our mortality and exists in eternal realms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after death. Even the most hard-hearted and wicked people on the earth can come to accept Jesus Christ as their savior and desire to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Our job is not to try and figure out who was righteous enough or not, but to see to it that everyone has an equal chance to get to heaven. <p> These are the first of the saving ordinances. There are more. The temple ordinance of the initiatory includes a symbolic washing and anointing of the body. This is to sanctify our bodies and set them apart for the work of salvation. It is a symbolic preparation for our future roles as kings, queens, priests, and priestesses. <p> Then there is the endowment, the film you have likely seen. Here, we are taught what we already have been taught, the gospel plan. We are reminded where we came from, why we are here, and what we are to do. The sacred oaths we take are promises to obey the Law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chastity, and the Law of Consecration. In exchange for our individual willingness to obey these commandments, we are given tokens that we can use to show Jesus that we have done what we were required to do. We are not to share these tokens with others : They must produce the faith necessary to obey these covenants on their own. <p> Having the tokens, we are then able to symbolically enter the Lord 's presence in the Celestial Room. This is a symbol for what we can have if we decide to keep the covenants we have just made. <p> There is also the ceremony of the sealing. This ceremony serves one purpose : To bind families together eternally. Man and woman are joined into married couples, and children are sealed to their parents. Were it not so, we are told, the whole earth would be smitten with a curse. This ceremony reminds us that while we can individually keep the law of the gospel, it is pointless to be saved alone. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure of eternal happiness. <p> There are rumored to be other ceremonies, each another symbol. I do not know much about them at this time. I am told that one symbolically represents our unity with Christ, another symbolically represents that we have proven ourselves completely worthy of exaltation. That is all I have heard. <p> Now, some people see members of the LDS church making covenants and think we are doing something wrong. Let me ask you what you think. <p> The Law of Sacrifice teaches us that if we want something, we have to pay for it. It teaches us that Christ paid the ultimate price, and if we are willing to receive him into our lives, we can have our sins paid for. <p> The Law of the Gospel teaches us not to take important things lightly, to treat people with respect, etc... <p> The Law of Chastity teaches us to be faithful to our spouses, to direct our lusts to building up families. <p> The Law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the kingdom of God. What is the kingdom of God? That 's the things that God does. What does he do? He does everything he can to elevate people. That 's what we should be doing. The purpose of the church is not church, after all. It is to bring people to Christ, to help them experience the joy and lasting happiness that only Christ can bring us. <p> I do not see any evil here. I do not know why people try to pretend we are part of some grand conspiracy. If it helps you understand, then yes, I am a part of that conspiracy too. I want nothing more than to absolve you of all guilt and shame, to bring you the same happiness I have. The worst part? I plan on bringing you these things without violating one iota of your free will, or using any compulsion whatsoever. I know, evil, right? <p> The church has been targeted since day one. We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are in. When you make it your life 's mission to overthrow the kingdom of the devil, the devil does n't go on vacation. <p> I feel sorry for people who, seeing something of such immense good in the world, decide the best course of action is to exaggerate and misrepresent our church. I feel especially sorry when people listen to them. Nevertheless, I have trusted the church to the Lord. I do n't intend to lift one finger to hurt these people, except to tell them they are wrong and help bring more truth in the world. <p> The sad part is that the Lord pays attention to these people, and it never ends well for them. When his patience runs out, or rather, when it becomes clear that they will not repent, he tends to clean up the mess they made and move on with the world. To understand what I mean, name one person who lifted their hand against our church and prospered for it. It simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single time our church has had a trial in the court of public opinion, our church has eventually won the day. <p> Anyway, if you want to learn what our church really believes, we send out 50,000+ missionaries every two years to knock on your door and tell you about it. I want nothing more than for you to experience the temple ordinances for yourself, in the proper state of mind, so you can see and hear and feel what I have seen and heard and felt. <p> If the presidential debate was a boxing match, then Romney landed quite a few knock-out punches. Obama seemed to put up his guard, and even tried to throw a few punches of his own, but he could n't stop the devastating force of Romney 's fury. <p> The most memorable is Romney 's closing statement. He believes in God. He believes we are all children of that God, and that everyone has a solemn duty to care for one another. After that, he described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he cared for and helped the people that he came in contact with in ever walk of life. The message was not so important as the delivery. Here was a sincere man sharing his sincerely held beliefs and his compassion and understanding for every American. <p> The second most terrible punch was when Romney laid out every failure of the Obama administration. It was n't in the spirit of trying to hurt Obama, but in trying to help him understand what has happened to the American people under his presidency. Romney did n't blame Obama 's motives. He did n't even blame his competency. He simply said that what he did did n't work, and it 's time to give something else a try, for the sake of the American people. Every American who has suffered under the Obama presidency felt something, I believe, in that moment. The fact that Candy Crowley did n't allow Obama to reply probably saved Obama from putting his foot in his mouth. It did n't matter. There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sorry, I 'll do better next time, if you trust me, which you ca n't. " <p> The third most terrible punch was on Obama 's energy policy. When Romney challenged Obama 's rebuttal that what Romney said was a lie, Obama faltered. He could n't answer the question, so he filibustered. Romney gave Obama as much rope as he wanted. When Obama finally realized what had happened, and turned Romney 's time back to Romney, the deed was done. <p> The question about equality in the workplace for women should have been a gim me for Obama. Instead, Romney got to answer first, and completely obliterated any liberal idea on the topic. One, as governor, he sought out for and hired and accommodated women in the workplace. He remarked that he gave his chief of staff the time she needed to be with her children spoke to the millions of single and married moms in the workplace. Work is not the goal for them : the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is why women do n't want to work even if they should. His second point, that a robust economy, where workers are in high demand, does not care about the gender of their employees, and would bend over backwards to make room for women was also heard and understood. Obama 's returning blow was wonkish and weak. Romney 's counter punch was a solid punch landing on a fighter crumpling at the knees. <p> The first question to Romney gave Romney a chance to unload a series of devastating blows on Obama, one after the other. Obama came out of his corner strong, but from the very beginning, his face was bruised and he was faltering. The mid-way comment about Obama 's economic failure was the point where Obama should 've turned around, and instead, he feel even further behind. <p> The question about gas prices and energy policy gave Romney a chance to land several devastating, crushing blows to Obama. The closing remark, asking people whether they are paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, more for energy in general, and whether they could afford four more years of that, sealed the deal. <p> The one faltering blow, Romney 's accusation that Obama did n't identify the Benghazi terrorist attack as a terrorist attack, did n't land cleanly at the debate. It even looked like Obama blocked it and countered with a nice sucker punch. While the impression of this to those who watched seemed to be reality, what really happened is now we are going to have a debate about how Obama handled the terrorist attacks under his watch for the next few weeks. Now Obama is going to have to fight the message sweeping America that he is weak and incompetent when it comes to the terror issue. Of course, Romney was right. It took two weeks for Obama to say the attacks were terrorist attacks and not protest rallies about some obscure YouTube video. But that 's going to come out over the next few weeks, and the Americans who plan to vote this year are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Obama. He is tired. He is repetitive. He has nothing interesting to say. His attacks on Romney were weak and easily defended. At times, he seemed even to parrot Romney. His closing statement was weak. In no case did he try to defend his record. His defenses were either " I did n't do it, Bush did ", " It 's hard being president ", or " You ca n't do any better. " That 's not what Americans want to hear, not now, not ever. <p> Edit : In terms of devastation to words, this was the phrase that was the most powerful : When talking about how he would be different than President Bush, Romney pointed out that Obama condemned Bush for spending half a trillion dollars over budget. But then Obama doubled it. The audience gasped. <p> Also, the smoothest counter-punch came when the moderator attacked Romney for flip-flopping on guns while he was governor. Romney 's smooth deflection, that he brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they both agreed to, was brilliant. The counter-punch, that Obama was incapable of doing anything like this, and Romney would resolve the division in DC, was marvelous. It was like watching a master at work. Lots of minds were changed at that moment, I believe. <p> Where do they find these women? She is n't ugly, she 's scary looking. She need to put on some weight. Why does her face look like that? She has that accent that drives me up the wall. Do the liberals know that they 've built up this image that inspires disgust in others when they hear their accent and see their sunken faces? <p> Joe Biden makes the first promise they did not keep : protect the American people. We are in more danger today, thanks to Obama 's failed policies, than we were in 2008. <p> Wherever the facts lead you? It 's too bad the president does n't care about the facts, blaming the deaths on free speech rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallow promise and threat. <p> It 's too bad Barack Obama does n't agree with Joe Biden. His priority has been to fundamentally transform America, not protect us. Biden then contradicts himself, putting priority on revenge, not security. If the last thing we need is another war, why did Obama entangle us in several new ones, without even consulting congress? <p> Ryan nails it : It 's a terrorist attack. Why was n't there a marine detachment protecting our ambassador -- France has one! Ryan calls out Biden for FAILING to get an agreement. It was his job. " Let 's not lose the things we fought so hard to get. " " Let 's not project weakness abroad. " Benghazi is indicative of a larger problem, the unraveling of the Obama policy. <p> The moderator inserts herself in the first question, wondering whether it was appropriate for Romney to talk about Obama 's failures. Was it appropriate? Why does she think the American people even care about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Obama administration did the same thing( they did.) Biden laughs. Is he nervous? Did he just get called out? " We should 've spoken right away when the Green Revolution started, when the Mullahs were attacking their people. " WOW! We should not impose the devastating defense cuts. <p> Biden interrupts, not even 10 minutes into the debate. Cuts off Ryan. <p> Calls Ryan 's observations " Malarkey ". Did n't he just say, moments ago, he wants to get to the bottom of the truth? Says EVERYTHING Ryan said was inaccurate. Blames Ryan for cutting embassy security. Blames Gov. Romney for making a political statement before the ambassador was known to be dead. Does n't understand why we look weak. Says Obama repaired alliances. Says Obama brought China and Russia together to pressure Iran. Says Ryan bets against America all the time. <p> Moderator interrupts to change the subject to Libya. What was Biden first told about the attack? Biden blames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance about Libyan ambassador wanting more security. Says he was n't told, blaming his underlings. Blames their entire answer on the intelligence community. Blames Romney for dividing the country. <p> Ryan, should the US apologize for burning Korans, urinating on corpses? Ryan says yes. Says we should NOT apologize for standing up for values. We Should NOT say that dictators who hurt their people are good guys. When the commander on the ground says we need more security, we should send more security. This was 9/11 anniversary, we knew Al Qaeda was rising, and we did n't even think to give our Benghazi security? Moderator interrupts Ryan again. <p> Iran : Ryan says Iran had the material for four years, we had four different sanctions, 3 by Bush, 1 by Obama, watered down by Russia. Mitt Romney wanted sanctions since 2007. Only because we had bi-partisan support we could get sanctions. Iran is stepping up, attacking people throughout the world. Obama is sending out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with unified, tough stance. Obama waters it down, is not unified. Biden laughs again. Romney will have credibility. <p> Biden : Could the Republican Congress do sanctions and get the world on board? What you want to go to war( Ryan : Prevent war.) I wo n't talk about classified info. Toughest sanctions in history of the world. We know how close the Iranians are to nuclear weapon, we are on the same page as Israel, and they are far away. Talked about fissile material. They need a launch mechanism. What are they talking about? What more can Obama do? <p> Ryan : Let 's look through the eyes of the Ayatollahs. They see Obama watering down sanctions. They speed up refinement, and Obama does n't do anything. They see Obama going on a talk show rather than meeting with Israel. They see the secretary of defense walk back. <p> Moderator interrupts again : How do you change their mind? Can you solve this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interrupted could n't even answer the question. Points out that we need credibility. <p> Biden : Ayatollahs see their economy crippled, exports crippled, world united against them. The idea that we do n't talk with Bibi is insane. He talks to Bibi all the time. He knows exactly what is going on. Bunch of " stuff ". Sec. Defense did n't walk anything back. They do n't have a weapon to put it into! Iran is more isolated today than when we took office. Totally isolated. <p> Biden : Facts matter. Loose talk. Not true they can get a weapon. The world is behind us. <p> Ryan : When the Sec. Def. says we ca n't go to war, then the administration loses credibility. When they saw the Green Revolution, Obama was silent for 9 days. When they see daulight between Israel and US, they are encouraged. <p> Mod : Another war in the Middle East? <p> Ryan : Worst is a nuclear Iran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, they call us the Great Satan, Wipe Israel off the Map. We ca n't live with nuclear Iran. <p> Biden : War is the last option. Crippling sanctions. Calls Romney a flip-flopper. Iran is being crippled. Obama does n't bluff. <p> Economy <p> Unfortunately, the &lt; 8% unemployment was a lie. <p> Can you get to under 6%? How long. <p> Biden : I do n't know how long. Can and will. Facts : Economy was in free fall. Great Recession hit. Lots of bad stuff. Rescued GM. Cut taxes for middle class. Romney said let Detroit go bankrupt. Romney said let foreclosures happen. Says 47% are unwilling to take responsibility for their lives. Ryan said 30% are takers. These people are my mom and dad and neighbors, pay more in income tax than Romney. They are elderly who live in SS. They are veterans and warriors who do n't pay taxes. It 's about time THEY take responsibility. They should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the poor a fair shot again, not have different set of rules, not to hemorrhage tax cuts, $5 billion to a bunch of families. Take responsibility. <p> Ryan : We 're from similar towns. Joe 's town has 10% unemployment. 8.5% when he came in.( Biden interrupts.) Yes, they inherited a tought situation.( Biden laughs.) 1.3% growth, slower than last year, getting slower. " We 're heading in the wrong direction. " 23 million Americans struggling or work. 15% are in poverty. This is not what a real recovery looks like. <p> Mitt Romney is a car guy. This is a guy who helped a family he did n't know who suffered a terrible car accident. Took care of college. Mitt does n't tell these stories. It was n't cash help. It 's his time. Gave 30% to charity, more than the two of us combined. Mitt gives his time. <p> About that quote " I think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your mouth the right way. "( Audience laughs) <p> Biden : " I always say what I mean. " Laughs. The crowd laughs at him. <p> Ryan : We want to get people out of poverty, help everyone succeed. Self-sufficiency. Opportunity. <p> Biden : If you think 47% is a mistake, I 've got a bridge to sell you. Appreciate ROmnay 's service, I know what it 's like. I sat in the homes of people who go through what I went through. People want to know you 've been through it. I do n't doubt Romney 's committment to people. <p> He had no commitment to the auto industry. I 've never met two guys more down on America than these two guys. If they 'd get out of the way and let us pass the tax cut, make it permanent, if they get out of the way, let us keep people in their homes. Stop talking about how you care, show me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> They talk about the recession where did it come from? Blames the wars, blames the tax cuts. Biden voted against that stuff. Now they care about the debt... <p> Ryan : Let 's not forget that they came in with one-party control. They had the ability to do eeverything of their choosing. : ool at where we are now. THey passed the stimulus, borrowed all that money, spent it, said unemployment would not be above 8%, 4% growth, it 's never been there. Mod interrupts. That 's what our plan is. VP was supposed to oversee the stimulus spending, it 's been wasted. 100 criminal invstigations. Wasted on green energy,. <p> Biden interrupts, no evidence of croniness. Love our friend -- asked for money for companies in Wisconsin. <p> Ryan defends : Advocating for 2 people asking for grants. <p> Biden : He said it would create growth and jobs. Congress said it was a model, less than 4/10 of % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and corruption. <p> Ryan " Was it a good idea to buy windmills from China? Was i a good idea to spend China 's money? <p> Bide : Moody 's said it was the best thing to do. We 've got a better track record than investment banks. <p> Ryan : Where are the 5 million green jobs? <p> Moderator moves on to medicare. Will programs have to change for medicare to survive? <p> Ryan : Absolutely. These programs are going bankrupt. They have to change. I know what these programs did for my family. Helped me go to college. Helped mom go to college, start a small business. She paid her taxes on the promise that these programs would be there. <p> You can change the program for 54 and younger, guaranteeing it, without changing for 55 and older. Chief actuary of medicare said Obama double-spent $700 billion. 15-person board, making decisions for our medical care. Social security 25% cut kicks in when it goes bankrupt. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table. Guarantee younger people coverage. More coverage for poor and middle class. Les for rich. We want people to decide, rather than 15 person. <p> CBO siad it would more for every senior when they got to retirement, but he got all the republicans to vote for it, ROmney would sign it. Believe who? AMA? Me? Or Ryan, who added $6,400 more to medicare? <p> Now they have a new plan : folks trust us! they say. Their ideas old and bad and eliminate the guarantee of medicare. <p> Ryan : They got caught hand in cookie jar of Medicare. Their own actuary came to congress say : 1 in 6 will go out of business. 7.4 million Seniors will lose their coverage of $3,200 benefit. Biden interrupts. <p> Ryan turns to Biden. " Mr. Vice President, I know you 're under a lot of duress... " Biden laughs " Hahahaha. " " I think the people will be better served if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't take all the 4 minutes then! " <p> Ruan : We 're saying Do n't change benefits for 55 and above! <p> Mod interrupts : What about those who ca n't make up the difference? Voucher? <p> Ryan : We put it together with former Clinton budget director. Biden : disavows it. Ryan : From the Clinton commision to save medicare. <p> Ryan : If we do n't if this problem soon, current seniors will get cut! <p> Biden : If they allowed medicare to bargain for cost of drugs like medicaid, that would save money. Ryan : Deny them choices. Biden : They are not denied! They are not denied! Have you been denied choices? Ryan : Because it 's working right now. <p> Mod : Why not very slowly raise the retirement age? <p> Biden : WE did that with SS in 1983. Tip O'Neill, Reagan. If everyone makes a sacrifice, we can make it solvent to 2033. We will NOT be part of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will not keep pace! If it did keep pace, no savings. We will not privatize social security. <p> Ryan : Nobody is proposing a voucher. Barack Obama said, " If you do n't have any fresh ideas, if you do n't have anything to run on, paint your enemy with a broad brush. " Let younger Americans have a voluntary choice. That 's not what Romney 's proposing : old people keep their benefits. For younger people : Do n't give rich benefits, raise retirement age slowly. <p> Biden : Romney plan, many studies say, is you 'd get less money. Cutting benefits without taking other actions is absolutely wrong idea. These guys have not been with Medicare, social security from the beginning. Who do you trust? Them who wanted to increase $6,400, or us? <p> Ryan : That was completely misleading. Biden : That 's a fact! Ryan : This is what people do when they do n't have a record to run on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much for my family we are not going to change it. <p> Ryan : Our entire premise of tax cuts is to grow economy and create jobs. We think government taking 28% is enough. Obama wants 44% of small business income. If you taxed every successful person and small business over $250k at 100%, we 'd run government for a few days. Their are n't enough rich people to tax to sustain the spending. When they say they will tax the rich, the tax bill ends up as middle lass. Canadians dropped tax rates to 15%, average is 20%, president wants 40%! This tax would tax 53% of small business income, 700,000 jobs. It does n't even pay for deficit. <p> We say lower taxes across the board, close off loopholes to rich, lower spending. <p> This $5 trillion plan I propose? Discredited in multiple studies, even their own campaign manager admits it 's not correct. <p> Moderator : How will you pay for 20% cut? Specifics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look at what Reagan and Tip O'Neill did. We want to work across the aisle, so we only have a framework. Deny the loopholes to rich, lower taxes across the board.( Biden laughs) We want to work with congress. Six studies guarantees the math adds up. <p> Biden : Let me translate. Reagan gave specifics. 97% of small businesses make less than $250k. What are the others Hedge funds. How sincere are they? Gov. Romney, you pay 14% on $20 million is that fair? Yes, he said. Those guys will cut loopholes? The carried interest loophole, the capital gains loophole. The reason all these studies say they will tax the middle class is to cut the mortgage reduction, college deduction. <p> Ryan : He is wrong about that. You can cut tax rates by 20% and still preserve the cuts for middle class. Biden : It 's never been done before. Ryan : Jack Kennedy did it. Biden : Oh, now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryan : You work with congress, you fill in the details, that 's how you get thing done? Biden : The republican congress? You 're going to work with them? Ryan : Romney worked across the aisle, and it worked. Biden : If he was so good, why is MA even contested? <p> Biden : Let tax cuts expires on the millionaires! They do not need the money! Middle class people need the help! Why does he cut the tuition tax credits! <p> Ryan : Close loopholes on high income people. <p> Biden : Can you guarantee that you wo n't close mortgage deduction? 97% of small businesses make less than $250k! <p> Ryan : The tax taxes a million small businesses who are our greatest job creators. <p> Mod : Defense budget? <p> Ryan : We 're saying do n't cut defense. They propose a $478 billion cut to defense. There is another cut on the horizon. Moderator interrupts. <p> Biden : We do n't cut it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for. HE said " We 've been looking for this moment for a long time. " Ryan : We 've been looking for bipartisanship for a long time. Biden : Military does n't need this stuff. They want a smaller military. Joint chiefs of staff. They made the recommendation first. <p> Moderator : Afghanistan. <p> At this point, I am losing interest. It looks like the rest of the country has as well. <p> Biden goes from laughing to angry. He ca n't wait his turn. He invents his own strawman, even though his opponent is sitting right there. He lies. I ca n't stand it anymore. <p> Ryan has run circles around Biden intellectually. I do n't know what he could 've done differently to keep Biden in his place. <p> Update : The internet is making fun of Joe Biden. The one redeeming political factor in his favor was that he was a sincere, nice guy. Now that 's gone. He 's just a drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The political system that the Anglo-Saxons lived under worked in protecting the people 's freedom to live their lives as they saw fit. However, the invading Vikings meant that they had to, of necessity, from time to time, join together, put on their armor and bear weapons, and kill as many of the enemy as they could. We do n't talk about much what the Anglo-Saxons did with the Vikings who survived and did not make it back on the boat. They were killed. They were killed to send a message to the Vikings that they would not be forgiven. They were killed to ensure the next invasion had that many fewer enemy. <p> Ultimately, the system fell apart, not because of the kings that organized the armies, but the apathy of the people in forming an army and working together. <p> This pattern has been repeated countless times, in countless ways, in countless cultures. When the people bind together to fight invasions for the common good, they enjoy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, allowing petty politics to get in the way, means that the necessary military force is not assembled in a timely manner, leaving the country to be enslaved. <p> The United States won independence from the king because he failed to protect the people. The king became the invader. So they rebelled, and decided to try their own hand at protecting themselves. They were inspired because they had already done so successfully, fighting the French and Indians in a previous war. <p> The United States government was reformed in 1786 not because of petty political reasons, but because it was the only way they could see to create an entity that could adequately provide for the common defense. Taxes were no longer optional. A single man was the commander in chief. A body of delegates had the power to appropriate funds to wage war. That was the real reason why we had to form the United States under the new constitution. The additional benefits, of domestic tranquility, of unifying the states into one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an added benefit, a benefit believed to be necessary to make the first condition exist. <p> Our federal government is, fundamentally, a war machine. That is why it exists. That 's why we tolerate it. When push comes to shove, we 're going to push harder, and we 're going to make sure the pushers stay down. Our federal government has been tremendously successful in that regard. There is no credible threat to our security and freedom on the planet. The next largest militaries could be wiped out in a matter of minutes or days, if we decide to do it. <p> We do n't have perfect security. We never will. Non-state actors can still harm us, as we saw on 9/11. So we decided to do things a little differently. No longer could we ignore the petty warlords and terrorists in God-forsaken lands. We had to use our military capabilities to " bring them to justice ", meaning, killing them. <p> That was the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to come here, we were going to hunt them down in their own countries, and kill them, before they could step foot in our country. That way, we do n't have to watch for terrorists at home. You do n't have to watch people coming and going through the airports, and scan them for bombs. You find the threats, root them out, and eliminate them. You make THEM live in terror, rather than the other way around. <p> The Obama Administration started off by declaring the War on Terror over, in not so few words. Now terrorist attacks were considered " man-caused disasters ". Now we were going to try and be buddy-buddy with the terrorists. " Oh, sorry for flushing your Koran down the toilet! We wo n't do it again! We swear! " The intended effect was to melt the hearts of our enemies, so that they would be our friends, and we can drink beer together in the White House garden to resolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a colossal failure. The bad guys did n't appreciate our signs of weakness. They decided to take it to the next level. They would overthrow their governments. They would threaten our allies. <p> Now, and ambassador is dead. His name does n't matter, because he is an ambassador. It was n't an attack on him personally, it was an attack on me, you, all of us. It was n't him alone that died, it was us. Our power has been challenged. <p> What does our president do? He apologized. He blames us for the attacks. He says, " You guys have to tone down that freedom thing you got going there. " <p> You know what, Mr. President? You have completely forgotten what the federal government is for. You have sought an office of an organization you can not even comprehend the purpose of. It 's like you 've become the CEO of GM and decided it was now your mission to save the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did that!) <p> The federal government is a war machine. It exists to keep the bad guys away from our people, so that we can live and work and love and die in peace. It 's there, chained by the constraints of the constitution, and by the power of the people, hanging in the shadows with weapons of unimaginable fury. When one of us is threatened, it steps forward and lays the hurt down. When a lot of us are threatened, we unleash it to break things and smash stuff and make people very unhappy with their decision to fight us. <p> Mr. President, you have the presidency. Use it for its purpose! Tell these people they are going to die a most horrible death! Tell them they are not worthy to run their own country, and that you plan to establish a government friendly to us, and you 're willing to kill anyone who thinks that 's a bad idea. Tell them! <p> Why God, or rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a God of law and order. He is the one who stretched out the heavens. He is the one who gives law to all matter within the universe. There is no randomness where God 's laws apply. The apply fully and completely in every moment of time and in every corner of the universe. <p> This alone is not enough. Even if animals believed in such a God, they would not develop science because they can not think like God. Only man is set a little lower than the angels. We are created in the image of God. We are promised that we can become like God if we adhere to the doctrines that God teaches. This potential to become like God includes the potential to understand the laws that govern the universe. It is the Christian faith that teaches us to reach up and pluck the fruit of understanding from the tree of life, rather than accept life as an animal, without understanding. <p> This still, is not enough. One more core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two qualities, a sort of science can emerge, but it would be a science of revelation, dependent solely upon man 's ability to understand God 's revelation. There is no judge except God, and he has only promised to judge mankind in the final judgment. <p> The last and final critical ingredient is the experiment. In the experiment, we try out our ideas against the universe itself. Since we believe that God ordered the universe, since we believe Man is capable of understanding those laws, and since we believe that God is no deceiver of men, then when we interrogate reality itself, we expect to get solid, reproducible answers that do not contradict what God has done. <p> This is, in short, the principle of faith that Christ and the prophets taught. Take what little understanding you have, and try it out. If it is good, then it will produce good. If it is not, then it will not. <p> Modern science simply can not exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Nye would have you believe that starting with those three assumptions makes one stupid or uneducated. I do n't know why they have this idea, except to blame it on the great deceiver of all mankind who would sift us and bring us down to his level. <p> Without God, what foundation of science could there be? Why should simply staring at the heavens be enough to drive someone to begin experiments with the idea that they will be reproducible, or to apply logic and reason to the universe with the idea that it should apply? Whatever reason you come up with should explain why, in all of recorded history, modern science was not invented until Christians who had rediscovered the sacred volumes of literature we call the Bible took the reigns of scientific thought in the world. <p> If you do n't want to watch it, I do n't blame you. It 's a completely vacuous argument against creationism. His arguments are roughly : <p> There 's too much evidence for evolution. <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a retort to him that would look the same, using the same words, but substituting Creationism for evolution. <p> Let me reiterate why a God-less universe is not only illogical, but impossible. <p> First, you can not disprove the existence of anything without examining all of the universe. Since we do n't have space ships or sensor arrays that can peer around corners of the galaxy and universe, we can no more disprove God than we can disprove that someone named Schmortz lives on the planet Fooble. <p> Second, supposing the technology, time, and energy exist, and someone actually does survey the universe. Not only can they disprove that Schmortz lives on Fooble, they could disprove that there is a God in this universe -- but only a God who is confined to natural laws. We do n't believe in such a God, so such a survey would be pointless. <p> You can, however, prove a positive. If you sincerely want to know whether God exists, and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants you to do with your life, you can find out for yourself through sincere prayer and devotion to his commandments as found in scripture. <p> Which religion is true? You can investigate the claims of each until you find one that actually preaches a consistent and verifiable religion. I believe the LDS religion is such a religion,. No, I know it is. I have long ago left the realm of belief because what I have seen is enough to prove to anyone that what I know is true. <p> Now, the second point I want to talk about is how the universe can not exist without God. See, God is the one that orders the elements, IE, provides the framework for the natural laws. Without him, the natural laws do n't exist. Everything is chaos and nothing would make sense. We know this because for the many millenia that man believed that God or the gods acted arbitrarily, rather than acting in accordance to universal laws that do not vary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept of the marriage of religion and logic and the universe around us( accepting things as they are rather than as they ought to be) that lead to the foundations of modern science. Our universe simply would n't be the way it is without those laws in place from the sub-atomic level to the inter-galactic level. <p> Some would argue the anthropic principle here. The universe exists, we exist, and therefore, the universe must be governed by laws and parameters that allow us to exist. The weakness of this argument is that it can be used to justify any explanation for the universe, if the explanation allows for the possibility of it at all. It is sort of the opposite to Occam 's Razor, a favorite theory that is often abused. <p> I, instead, argue that the laws must come from somewhere. There must be a reason that this universe exists of all universes, despite the improbability of it all. And that reason, that organizing and stabilizing force, is God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not explain it, or rather, if we relied on luck or chance to explain it we would be in a sorry state. IE, we would be forced to accept the anthropic principle and all the lunacy attendant to that. Instead, if we accept that there is a God that orders the universe, modern science survives intact. <p> This might seem like odd reasoning to many who are n't used to reasoning. Without X, things do n't make sense. With X, things do make sense. Therefore, to preserve sense, we must assume X. Physicists have been doing this all along. Somehow, it 's acceptable to use things like Electrodynamics for X, or the General Theory of Relativity, or the Standard Model, but God? Without God, the universe does n't make sense. With God, it does. <p> Bill Nye 's final appeal is for us to sacrifice our children to meet his desires. This is a thought process that bewilders me. Why should I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am as offended as he should be if I demanded he teach his children according to what I thought was best, so that I could benefit the most. <p> Logic and reasoning are not the strong points in the Atheist world view. To be an Atheist, you must be what you claim your enemies are : ignorant of the universe around us. <p> Let me help you understand why, using evolution. In no case have I seen such a relationship between science as in geology and evolution. Geology assumes an ancient earth, not because there is evidence that supports this( which there is n't, unless you assume all geological processes occur at a constant rate, which is absurd), but because they find so-called ancient animals in the strata they observe. On the other hand, evolutionists claim as evidence that their fossils are old that they are discovered in ancient rocks. One relies on the other, and the other on the one. Why does no one talk about this? <p> Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how firm a foundation carbon dating was, and yet, how absurd a concept it was when you examined it in any detail. It assumes things we can not assume. One, that at the time the animal or plant was covered, the ratio of carbon isotopes was similar as it is today. Two, that carbon, like all elements, decay at a constant rate, that is, no outside influence can change the decay rate of any substance. The former has been thoroughly debunked, so much so that carbon dating is only accurate within timescales of written human history, and that only because we have documents with dates on them. The latter is being questioned today, as two independent physicists have discovered that decay rates seem to change over time. What conclusions this has, no one knows exactly, except to say our assumptions were worth as much as the paper they were written on. <p> Any historical science suffers from the same critical flaw : We can not rewind the clock to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time " obscure the past so thoroughly and so quickly we have a hard time figuring out when, exactly, a body was killed, and what exactly killed it, unless we have a fresh corpse. As time marches on and the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics imposes its toll, we know less and less about what happened, until we can known nothing at all, even if there was a body to begin with. There simply is n't enough data and there is n't enough certainty to rewind the clock more than a few years in the past, at best. Those who claim they know what happened thousands, millions, and billions of years ago are lunatic. At best, we can guess, and even then, it is likely wrong. <p> Bill Nye is a prophet of the pseudo-scientists Atheists wish was taught in our schools. I say, good luck imposing that religion via the power of the state on the rest of us. I would rather live in a world where people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong, rather than a
