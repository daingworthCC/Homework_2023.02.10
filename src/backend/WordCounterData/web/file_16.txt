5028141 <h> Facebook Friends <h> Reviews from Your Friends <h> 15 reviews in English <h> Review from Jen M. <p> We had a pleasant experience overall visiting with a LivingSocial coupon. There are quite a few reviews already that hit most of the big points so I 'll try to keep it real : *yes it 's close to the road but if you 're in a cottage you ca n't hear the traffic, plus they have noise generating alarm clocks. *the cottages are clean and nicely provided with enough for two drams of port wine and fluffy robes. Couples - the tub is worth it. Trust us.( Cue heavy bass 70 's funk music) *food is tasty and nicely presented at breakfast. We 're not used to eating right when we get up, but the pancakes and sausage did n't last long. *we had no interaction with anyone until we checked out, and Dennis was pleasant. We 'll be back. Harrisonburg and the surrounding area are nice, and this B &B; has a few deals with local wineries and spas. <h> Review from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but has many major downsides. At first we were shocked at how close it was to the " side of the road. " They 're not kidding- it 's right there- next to a major highway. And in a residential-like neighborhood. Kind of disturbs your peaceful balcony sitting when cars keep coming by- not a great view from the house. I will agree with the other reviews in that the breakfast tried to be fancy, but was n't enough for my husband. Neither was the picnic lunch- just a pack of pretzels( those snack stick kind), a small hunk of cheese, a piece of french bread, and an orange. That 's not really a lunch. <p> I will also agree with the other reviewer that the rooms were clean and nice but the setup was n't great to see the tv( which was really old and small) and I was shocked at the gratuity envelope. Really made us feel uncomfortable- especially after we checked online to see what others had to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not expected. The sign made it seem like it was rude if you did n't tip. <p> Our overall major problem, however, was the attitude of the innkeepers. Maybe all B &B; innkeepers are like this( we just experienced another bad time a few weeks before). Dennis was rude and made us feel bad about coming towards the end of the check-in window- the check in was from 3-6 and we came around 5:30 and he made us feel like we were inconveniencing him. I know others have said that the lady was nicer, but get down to it, and she was just as rude as Dennis. When something happens she is very condescending and is fakely sweet- says everything will be fine but then charges you for any issues. Very upsetting. <p> We came here to relax and overall, this did not do the trick. We hated our weekend. <p> This couple revealed that this weekend was their " pre-wedding escape. " Since it appears nothing was to their satisfaction, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-wedding stress experienced by most couples. Most unfortunately, a bottle of red wine destroyed the valuable bright yellow quilt on the bed. This couple was responsible for the loss and we are certain this contributed to their negative feelings about the inn. Any review required the time of the patron and is appreciated. <h> Review from Zach W. <p> My wife and I have been to a lot of B &Bs; in the Shenandoahs - each has it 's strengths &; weaknesses. But I have never seen an establishment strive for mediocrity quite like this one. Maybe it 's because I 'm a foodie that I found this place particularly offensive. Your breakfast is microwave prepared Kirkland products, so is the " picnic " which consists of a block of tasteless co-jack cheese, two measly out of season clementines, and pretzels. <p> But most surprising of all were the attitudes of the proprietors. When I originally booked my stay, I was told to call if I thought I might be later than 9pm. So at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty awful storm, that 's what I did. Janice answered, and I reported my situation. She said something to the effect of, " oh no, this just wo n't do. " I pleaded, saying we would n't be that late, and she became even more uneasy, then said she 'd have her husband call me. Dennis calls when I 'm 20 miles outside of DC. The first thing he has to tell me is " you 'll have to come tomorrow " -- not asking me my status, feeling out the situation, just rigidly telling me I have one option. I pushed back and said this frankly was not very polite or acceptable, as they never warned me of a turn-away policy. <p> We arrived at 9:11, and I made a big effort to apologize for everything, and said I wanted to be on a good foot, and thanked them for staying up all of 11 minutes for us( but said it nicer than that). Dennis proceeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one of the bars if we wanted, saying they stayed open late. My wife asked politely, " what 's late? " and he shot back, " This is late. " <p> Dennis also gave us a hard time at checkout, asking rudely why I never returned their picnic basket - I calmly told him we left it in our room on the table for him to find. <p> So not only was the food cheap and unimaginative, but we had very passive aggressive hosts - and to validate this gripe, just see their responses to the negative review by Tatyana V( wow, that is not how you handle a negative review). Oh, and I tipped them $40 in the envelope marked GRATUITY that stares you in the face for your entire stay. At least I took the high ground. <p> We look back fondly on Zach and Victoria 's visit and remember a pleasant conversation with them on Saturday morning. We would offer the following facts about our menu : Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Country Pancakes( from Marian Cunningham 's Breakfast Book) with our homemade original-recipe Orange Cardamom Syrup on Saturday and a Fines Herb Souffle on Sunday, also made from scratch. Guests repeatedly request these recipes which we are happy to share. We support local farmers and the cheese in the picnic is from our local market. Our Light Picnic lunch, designed to accompany guests to wine-tastings, is always fresh. We are so sorry it was unsatisfactory for Zach. We never abandon the standard of excellence to which we are committed and thank you, Zach, for your feedback. <h> Review from Jean S. <p> My husband Greg and I purchased a Living Social Deal for this bed and breakfast and visited this past weekend, 5/18-20. We were very pleased with the great deal and the service. The suite we stayed in was very clean and accommodating. They let us check in early on Friday, served us a great homemade breakfast delivered to our suite each morning, Gave us free champagne, wine glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wifi hookup, and ipod player, dvd player, etc. The family was very friendly and informative about the area and we had a wonderful time. We will visit again! <h> Review from Mark P. <p> We stayed in the Fitzgerald Cottage, which has two stories, the top being the bedroom with a wonderfully deep king size bed, the bottom floor being the real special part of the cottage : a tub for two with the fireplace right next to it. In the morning, a breakfast basked was waiting outside the door for us, filled with caramel waffles, fruit, juice and coffee. Very nice to wake up to. The place is full of other nice little touches : candy basket here, plush bathrobes there. <p> The owner seems a little crusty : he gave us a little guff for asking to check out an hour later than planned. That 's the only negative I can think of. <h> Review from Fred L. <p> My wife purchased a Living Social coupon valid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it to stay there due to scheduling issues. The owners were not interested in working with us to get a date scheduled( we tried, and we were nice :) - insisting instead that we go through Living Social. <p> As the expiration of our Living Social Escapes deal coupons approached, we unfortunately had to send many folks back to Living Social. Since this happened, Living Social now requires reservations be made within 30 days of buying an Escapes voucher. Living Social issued " deal bucks " or refunds to these customers who were unable to stay prior to the deal coupon expiring. To Fred L. - We are sorry your experience was less than positive and hope you 'll give us another chance in the future. Thanks for your interest in By the Side of the Road! <h> Review from Stacy B. <p> By the Side of the Road Inn was a fabulous get-away from the hustle and bustle of Washington, DC. We felt very welcomed and loved our room - the 1790 Suite. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was wonderful, as well as a private deck overlooking rolling hills of the Shenandoah Valley. Breakfast both mornings was top notch - very gourmet( and this is coming from a person who is not big on breakfast). The Inn was very clean and quiet. <p> We had an amazing dinner at the Joshua Wilton House and Kline 's ice cream was at the caliber of The Dairy Godmother in Alexandria, VA. <p> Heard great things about the Lavender Farm, but we were unable to make it. We took Skyline drive back on a beautiful fall day. <p> The only downfall was that we had bigger expectations for downtown Harrrisonburg... however, we really really enjoyed James McHone antique jewelers - I got an amazing gemstone ring! http : //www.mchonejewelry... <h> Review from Jason C. <p> I have not stayed at By the Side of the Road as I live on the same road, but I have known the owners for over 20 years and know that they are wonderful people that know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about staying there. It is a very nice place. Highly recommended. <h> Review from J T. <p> We stayed at this lovely B &B; twice, the first time with just my husband and me( in the Bishop 's Retreat room) and the second time with our 11 year old son( in the 1790 Suite). The rooms are very clean and we really felt at home. They even provided DVD 's, games, books and magazines. You can tell that they went above and beyond with providing other necessities within the room/bathroom. We all had a great time and would definitely recommend this B &B; to anyone that is looking to have a nice relaxing/fun weekend! <p> Breakfast was top notch ; Janice 's cooking was definitely gourmet style with flawless plate presentation. As you can imagine, we looked forward to breakfast each morning. The nice picnic bag/pouch that was provided was perfect ; everything that you would need is provided( plates, utensils, blanket, napkins, etc). To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decadent desert. <p> We got a chance to meet Janice, Dennis and Anna( at separate occasions) and they were all so gracious, attentive( but not overly) and welcomed us into their lovely home. Their picturesque home is very tidy and decorated with charming personal effects. There is a lot of history that can be learned just by looking around their house. <p> Even though Harrisonburg seems like a very quiet and quaint town, there was a lot to do there. <p> We 've gained new friends at " By The Side of the Road " and look forward to future visits. <h> Review from Robin F. <p> Thank you to Living Social for helping us discover this hidden gem in the Shenandoah Valley - only 2 hours( well 3 in traffic) from DC and such a great weekend getaway. The innkeepers Janice and Dennis were just so warm and welcoming - the room was spacious, the breakfasts were amazing, and the picnic they packed for our afternoon outing was just perfect. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just did the farmers market and had a picnic lunch at the local Lavender Farm before taking a nap on the huge lawn at the B &B.; <h> Review from Katherine C. <p> Like dozens of other people, we grabbed a deal for this place on Living Social earlier this year. And wow, what a deal! A stay here is easily worth more than we paid for it. Great value! <p> We arrived the Saturday of Labor Day weekend, for our two night stay. Dennis, one of the innkeepers, was friendly and gracious greeting us, and gave us a nice little tour of the property.( We met Janice, his wife, at breakfast the next day.) After that, their service was fantastic when we needed it but unobtrusive otherwise, which is exactly what you want on a romantic weekend away. <p> Our room, the 1790 suite, was bigger than half of the 1-bedroom apartments I 've been in. And it had a ridiculously comfortable bed. I kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it! The rooms were indeed quiet and private as advertised ; we heard our neighbors coming up the stairs or leaving, but that was the only time we knew they were there. <p> The other half of B &B; is, of course, the breakfast. And... wow. The second day we had blueberry pancakes which were fine ; better than you 'd get at, say, a diner, but not as good as my mom 's. ;) The first day, though, we had these AMAZING little souffles. I 've never had anything like it. I will remember that fondly for quite some time. <p> Other than that, the package we got included plenty. We enjoyed the local restaurant and vineyard and ice cream. I might not recommend being there on a Saturday/Sunday as we were, as it seems that half of Harrisonburg is still closed on Sundays, and that will severely limit your options for where to go and what to do. <p> If you 're looking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, this is a great place to do it! Particularly if you get their local package at a discount, as we did. Ca n't beat that value, and we 're thinking of going back in early fall next year as well. <h> Review from Kate R. <p> We enjoyed our stay, but were slightly disappointed in portion sizes for breakfast and the picnic lunch( enough for me to eat, but not enough for my husband). I was also taken aback by the sort of gruff attitude of Dennis - impatient and not very welcoming - especially when contrasted with a very brief interaction with Janice, who is warm and friendly. <h> Review from Adam H. <p> My fiance and I were just married on Dec 27th and spent our wedding night and the next 2 nights at By the Side of the Road B &B.; It was an amazing place to stay and I highly recommend it. We spent the first 2 nights in their Quill Cottage &; our final night in the Fitzgerald Cottage. Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plasma TV 's, jetted jacuzi tubs and fireplaces. We enjoyed being able to spend a bit of time in both cottages as they both have very unique feels. The Quill cottage is a relatively new building with high ceilings and very modern appointments. At the same time that it is modern feeling, it still is able to maintain a " country " kind of feel. My bride and I were both very much impressed and it exceeded our expectations. The Fitzgerald Cottage was built in the 1800 's and is a two story building were as the Quill is a ranch style. The Fitzgerald cottage has a great feeling of history to it and the real wood burning fireplace( as opposed to gas in the Quill Cottage) gives it a charmingly old-fashioned appeal. Overall we very much liked both cottages, but the Fitzgerald is defintely unique in its history, spiral staircase, double decks, and wood burning stove. You ca n't go wrong with either though. The breakfast was delivered to our doorstep every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and find breakfast waiting outside. The food was all delicious and very well prepared. If you are staying anywhere in the area I highly recommend you stay w/ By the Side of the Road.
