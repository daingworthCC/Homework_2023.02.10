5095141 <p> PJ Media has learned that a team of career lawyers, expert analysts, and supervisors in the Justice Department Voting Section recommended that South Carolina 's photo voter identification law be precleared under the Voting Rights Act as non-discriminatory. Presidential appointees in the Justice Department then disregarded the career recommendation and an objection followed, blocking South Carolina 's voter ID law. <p> South Carolina filed suit in federal court, and a trial concluded a few weeks ago. The parties are briefing the case and a decision is expected shortly.( See " DOJ Lawyers Waste Your Money Over Fonts " at PJ Media.) <p> This information directly contradicts a central theme of Attorney General Eric Holder 's civil rights enforcement -- that career civil servants have been placed back in charge of Voting Rights Act enforcement. It also raises questions about political interference during an election year that has resulted in hundreds of thousands of dollars in costs from a federal court lawsuit to defend the decision by political appointees to overrule the career recommendation. Had voter ID been precleared, South Carolina would not have needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats have pushed the narrative that Bush political appointees overruled the recommendation of career lawyers inside the Voting Section and precleared Georgia voter ID in 2005. This story is false because the career civil servant in charge of the Voting Section recommended that Georgia voter ID should be precleared, and the political appointees followed his recommendation. <p> That did n't stop Senator Patrick Leahy( D-VT) from saying " the Washington Post ran two front page articles detailing how President Bush 's political appointees within the Division were overriding career litigators ' recommendations on crucial voting rights cases.... There are disturbing reports that career lawyers have been shut out of the Division 's decision-making process. " <p> Even then-Senator Barack Obama joined in, attacking now-PJ Media contributor Hans von Spakovsky 's role in approving Georgia voter ID : " Reports indicate that Mr. von Spakovsky joined other senior officials in overruling the recommendations of several career staff lawyers who had reviewed the Georgia voter ID law and determined that it would unduly hinder the ability of black voters to cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Section became a central campaign theme of candidate Obama, as I document in my book Injustice. <p> Once upon a time, the opinion of career staff at the Voting Section about a voter ID submission was the lodestar to Leahy and Obama. <p> The South Carolina voter ID law was reviewed by civil rights analysts, a veteran attorney reviewer, the deputy chief in charge of Section 5 enforcement, and ultimately the section chief. Extensive and detailed memos were prepared by career staff recommending that South Carolina voter ID be precleared. There was a very small difference in voter ID possession between blacks and whites -- only a 1.6% difference. South Carolina made photo ID free and allowed anyone with a reasonable impediment in obtaining one to vote anyhow after completing an affidavit. Based on these facts, career staff recommended preclearance. <p> But according to DOJ staff familiar with subsequent events, Assistant Attorney General Tom Perez and Deputy Assistant Attorney General Matthew Colangelo then overruled the career staff and ordered that the Department of Justice object to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior that Leahy and Obama had falsely accused the Bush Justice Department of conducting. <p> Tom Perez <p> This revelation is also damning because it means there is extensive DOJ documentation supporting South Carolina 's lawsuit. DOJ lawyers did not reveal to the three-judge federal panel the internal preclearance recommendation stating that the law did not discriminate. Nor did the Justice posted immediately. If you feel your comment was filtered inappropriately, please email us at story@pjmedia.com. <p> Racialists of the HIGHEST magnitude are now in control of the most important law enforcement agency in the U.S. It is as if rapists are in charge of victim rights centers, and adjudicating against rape victims! <p> It is a travesty of injustice created by a Radical-in-Chief, hell bent on remaking the U.S. into a third world nation. <p> Not that it makes Americans feel any better, but the AG office in Israel is Arabist/leftist in the extreme, and adjudicates to the detriment of all Jews in Israel. I kid you not. This has been the case since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews have died due to their( politically charged/prejudiced) decisions. And, I have the statistics to back up my assertion. <p> Thanks Clarice. Let 's sit back and watch the writers and critics who in 2006 were in a frenzy to see if their outrage has partisan bias or not. Signs point to yes. One leftist election blog already is already running interference for the government, rather than asking tough questions. <p> This kind of rank hypocrisy from the Obama/Holder Department of Justice has come to be expected now and, sadly, is not altogether surprising. What is tragic, though, is that it does not get more widely reported due to the highly complicit mainstream media, which is so closely ideologically aligned with the partisan liberals running DOJ. Kudos to Christian and PJ Media for exposing these knd of incidents. <p> No. Even as shaky as Obama 's record was before the election, there 's no way any reasonable person could anticipate the shameless, blatant corruption of this administration. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm reading you correctly, the court currently adjudicating this case does not have access to those internal DoJ documents, nor any of this evidence pointing to the blatantly political decision to block SC 's voter ID law. So they 'll make their decision based on incomplete information. <p> Is there any legal complaint that can be made, either before the decision is made, or after a decision against the state, to charge the DOJ with violating the discovery rules that can reverse the decision in time for the election? Or is the only alternative to appeal the ruling on this new information, which would no doubt happen after the election, which is exactly what Holder is trying to accomplish? Once the election is over, he will care less if he gets overturned. <p> And has anyone noticed how all these cases are being decided too close to the election to be appealed in time? On one of them reported here recently, the court sat on it for a year, only to rule for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with Texas ' redistricting). <p> Coincidence? Right. <p> And Christian, do you know if the DOJ is pulling the same trick on the military votes as they did in 2010, granting waivers to all the election boards controlled by Democrats to allow them to send ballots to the troops too late to have them back in time to be counted? This practice is despicable and disgusting, but that 's nothing unusual for this administration. <p> All of the non-lawyers speculating are making incorrect assumptions. The DOJ 's administrative decision-making process, like it or not, has absolutely zero relevance to the court 's judgment on the matter. The court reviews the law de novo. What the DOJ did during its administrative review of the law is not relevant to the court 's review of the law. The court will review the law entirely independently from the DOJ 's decision. Christian knows this. So when he says, " There is nothing in the court record, " he 's being an artful lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not telling the whole story. <p> JNM is being an artful lawyer too.( You should at least disclose where you work!) If you read the Texas voter ID opinion, you 'll know that the court indeed spent a good deal of ink on the administrative process. JNM is right, it is supposed to be de novo. But in reality, in Texas at least, the court seemed to be paying close attention to the administrative review process. Of course we all know that federal courts are totally immune to outside influences which were not admitted into evidence, so we can probably assume the court will pay no attention to conclusions in the administrative process by the career professionals that the law should have been precleared. <p> Somehow I 'm thinking that the defenders of the ID statute might want to be tugging on the judges ' sleeves. Were documents of this nature not requested in discovery? If so, would witholding them be... problematic? Why, yes. Yes it would. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but man has studied conflict resolution for centuries. Surely there are rules of conduct in the legal profession, which appears to be violated. Congress, not DoJ makes the law. In 2012, I have serious concerns why the states of the old Confederacy are treated any differently that Chicago in voter requirements based on race. And, from my expertise, engineering, I can say that the power of the government to detect all human behavior is in its infancy. The cost of detectors, transmission, and data processing and storage has plummeted in the last generation. This will continue. Voter ID cards may give way to retina scans. Ergo, should voters be required to bring their eyeballs to a voting location? <p> As a former manager, I accept that higher officials may over rule their subordinates. In the private sector, this can lead to termination of the subordinate( which should be extremely rare, in my experience due to almost psychotic arrogance&lt; " I am right all others are wrong " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this intramural divide should be exposed. Was South Carolina dumb? Was the rules of discovery too narrow? Was DoJ crooked( violate the law?) Was the judge asleep, allowing extraneous questioning? <p> We have a right to competent, honest lawyers in government.( I know several and they are very intelligent, decent people ; I can not judge their expertise.) We also have a right to pay for only one legal position from our government. Currently we often pay for both plaintiff and defendant. Thus my solution would be to cut the DoJ budget in half, every year, compounded, until the top echelons got their act together. In the private sector this is common, and effective. When Mr. Perez is terminated, loses his house in foreclosure ; it will flavor his legal theories. <p> Calling this bunch of liars and absolute racists and political hacks the " Department of Justice " is just as great a misnomer as calling Obamacare the " Affordable " patient care act. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact opposite of what they are. -- -- And there 's the " Most Transparent Government " that 's about as transparent as a black tombstone. <p> Isnt it about time for the Federal Government to leave the South alone? The Civil War was 150 years ago. Jim Crowe laws are dead and gone. In my travels I have seen more discrimination outside the South than down here. <p> Today we had elections in the Netherlands and though not agreeing with the outcome each and every eligible citizen needs to show his ID before being handed a ballot form. Any other way seems a bit ' undemocratic '! <p> I totally agree with Rogerola. Unless you can show ID, what is going to stop non-citizens from voting? Surprisingly, even in America, illegals have Driver Licenses and ID Cards... States have the right to stop voter fraud! <p> This fact about the DOJ internal deliberation suggests that the Section 5 preclearance obligation induces a political agenda by DOJ civil rights lawyers who advance this provision to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ von Spakovsky authored a legal memorandum titled The Bailout Bait and Switch : DOJ 's Last-Ditch Attempt to Rescue Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. The Section 5 preclearance obligation should be rendered unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in TX v. Holder, Shelby County v. Holder, or FL v. Holder for exceeding congressional authority to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitutional for incongruity and disproportionality, which is forbidden by the City of Boerne v. Flores for congressional enforcement clause authority limits and Mulloch v. Maryland for the necessary and power clause. If Section 5 preclearance exceeds congressionality authority under Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment, then it violates the Fifth, Tenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments in addition to Article IV of the Constitution as contended by Shelby County, Alabama. The covered jurisdictions should no longer be obligated to submit proposed electoral regulations to the three-judge district court in Washington, DC or the Department of Justice. The National Black Chamber of Commerce and Project 21 agree that Section 5 preclearance is unconstitutional. Justice Clarence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rendered invalid since intentional discrimination on account of race, color, or membership in a langugage minority does not exist. Former MI Attorney General Mike Cox, Former AL Attorney General Troy King, and Former SC Attorney General Henry McMaster would be appropriate candidates qualified for the position of Attorney General of the United States. <p> I intended to reply to something offensive, but my " Do n't be a fool... " comment is n't now attached to anything, and I do n't see any particularly offensive comments.
