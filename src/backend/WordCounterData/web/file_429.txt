5069741 <p> " Jackie is like hella ' old. She 's like 60-something, " Govan said earlier this morning. " She 's too old to be like in the juice like that.... She talking about she the first lady. I 'm like, in what? Craziness. You got cooky problems. " <p> Then in perhaps her most shocking revelation, she reveals she had ANOTHER fight on the show. <p> " You know what 's crazy. I 'm gon ' tell y'all a secret. I scrapped even after that, but they did n't show it. Thank god. " <p> When asked if the fight involved Malaysia, she said, " It was somebody else. It was awful. " <p> Hmm..... I ca n't imagine VH1 leaving fist fights on the cutting room floor since that 's what people watch for. I 'm sure that fight will appear in a segment on the reunion tonight on VH1 at 8 p.m.ET/PT. <h> Comments <p> For draya nd malaysia to be the youmgest ones the are more mature then all of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a hoe as far as imani goes I think she is a follower. Draya prob making more money on her own then they do anyway nd thats why they some hattn ass bitches. <p> For draya nd malaysia to be the youmgest ones the are more mature then all of them. Jackie crazy laura is dumb as hell nd gloria is a hoe as far as imani goes I think she is a follower. Draya prob making more money on her own then they do anyway nd thats why they some hattn ass bitches. <p> Jackie was stirring up zhit unnecessarily. Girls can say things about each other and move on - but Jackie makes a bigger deal out of it than it is. She 's just plain weird and I wonder how her husband feels about her after seeing this show. When she was only person providing the story she made it out like ALL the OTHER girls are crazy... not me! Now he 's going to see how she 's CRAZY. I think Laura is physically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turn everyone against Malaysia. Until Malaysia let her know she was n't the one, then Laura becomes sweet. Do n't like Gloria AT ALL - and if she slept with Laura 's man AFTER he was Laura 's man - that would be pretty weird and it would make sense that that would be the fight they do n't air and that Laura wo n't give any names on. Gloria seems so stuck up, but in reality she is covering up her insecurities-which was showcased when Matt said he just now getting into her. She been giving him everything for years - that hurts. She probably thinks she 's in a good spot to be single and re-evaluate her life. But when he agreed, she was not ready for the break-up. She wanted him to fight for her - he was just tolerating her. I think Imani was a weak b*tch for not confronting Laura woman to woman and not just take a 3rd party 's word. Jackie was able to easily manipulae Imani because she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Draya 's immature, but mature enough not to be dogged out without saying nothing. How she stayed buddies with Jackie for so long is a mystery. But, she 's weak too - it 's not her fault. She 's been scared with the curse of beauty that make woman jealous and men too eager. She 's not really more beautiful than anyone else, but she is stereotypically beautiful - and that tires out fast for men - so, she is single( that we know of). <p> 2 Words : HOT MESS! Laura wanted to be the bully of the show at first then she tried to turn that leaf after Malaysia tapped dat ass. The 2nd fight(( if any)) was probably with Draya. If so, she gets NO cool points for that. I would like to sit all of they grown asses down and read each every one of them because they need to be told the hell off with the exception of Malaysia and Imani. They were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just a sucker and should have stood up for herself more. I never understood why she wanted to encircle herself with such messy ass old ass miserable ass ca n't keep a man ass drama infested ass women any damn way. Laura 's avatar looking ass needs to worry about those kids and why her man hunching her damn sister. She is the last person that needs to be pointing fingers at ANYBODY when there are rumors that she was sleeping with Shaq. That makes her NO BETTER than what she portrayed Draya to be. And as far as calling her a deadbeat mother, I saw the pic of those kids and yeah, she could have done that little girls hair and dressed them just as nice as she was. She rockin ' Armani and they rockin GRANIMALS. NOT CUTE mama! <p> I would like for shaunie and laura to go at it. Real talk. If she is so damn hard why not tell the truth about the shaq affair and move on. Laura and Gloria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together. Both of their men cheated on them so of course they were getting it in as well. That is why gloria ass left miami before the dirt aired about her and her sister. Lord as for draya I do nt even know why she went on the damn show.It has done more harm than good <p> Can anyone tell me who Jackie is talking about Gloria Fu*** this is the second time she mentioned it but they keep bleeping it out. She mentioned it the night they all had dinner and she mentioned it at the Reunion <p> That was the wackest and most boring reunion show ever. Why is John Salley hosting? He 's lame, boring, and displays a lot of bitchassness up their gossiping and instigating a bunch of foolish women. They need to bring Wendy Williams back to host. I was thoroughly embarrassed for all of them, especially Jackie. She has mental problems and is trying too hard to be the standout " Nene " of the show. <p> They all talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear what she said about you? " and then go back and tell the other one after she kept that ish going. The girl 's wig is too tight and she 's crazy as fuck. They should have whipped HER ass. <p> That fight was with DRAYA and its because Draya has been with Gilbert Arenas so laura got mad. They have a scene where Draya apologizes for it, but it is HEAVILY edited. The pics of Draya and Gilbert are all over and that is why Laura was always saying she could never kick it with Draya like that. <p> Hi guys, i am in high school and made $14,000 from felmina alliance which is an offshore investment program that really helps you, i am a living witness. My life has changed tremendously, i can get anything i want, i just want to get the word out that this is not some flemsy program trying to take your money this is LEGIT so if you are interested please click the link <p> you are so right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackie was being messy and instigating but she was not lying. Those girls all talk mess and were guilty so they put it all on her. Malaysia is a shady b*tch too bc she said mad ish about draya but smiles in her face. <p> you are so right! Laura is shady and so is her sister. Jackie was being messy and instigating but she was not lying. Those girls all talk mess and were guilty so they put it all on her. Malaysia is a shady b*tch too bc she said mad ish about draya but smiles in her face. <p> They all talked about each other. Gloria about all of them including her sister and Laura talked about all of them but since they want to lead the wack pack they are reeling all those girls in. Malaysia is the shadiest of them all. She never looks anyone in the eye esp in her confessionals her eyes are always shifty. Second, she talked about Draya like a dog and saying she does n't eff with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does nt know why Draya thinks they are friends. Um bc you smile in her face. Imani called Draya worthless and did nt even want to admit it until Jackie said no lets put it all out on the TABLE! No one liked Draya bc she is a ho and is a bad mother. Laura talked about Draya saying she does n't eff with her like that and she means nothing to her to Gloria and she does n't care about her but yet is acting like she is friends with her wearing all black and ish. Gloria said she does not care if Malaysia gets hit by a bus AFTER she spoke with Malaysia, her sister and Laura. Imani has no personality and is mad that she is being used by Laura when Gloria had a big ole mansion with Matt and could not let her sister Laura crash or store her things so she called Jackie and vented. <p> I 'm with the poster who said L fought her own sister Stuffy nosed Gloria that 's why it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mms fight and they showed that so what would stop them from showing L manhandle Draya again it Would have been ratings gold L fought her old bag eyed sister GROSS your own Sister who slept with your fug man eeww <p> There 's a difference between telling the truth, for honesty 's sake, and manipulating or misusing the truth for the purpose of creating controversy. Not only is Jackie an instigator, she is also a very self-centered individual who appears to be out of touch with reality. I do not doubt for a second half of the things that were said amongst the women about each other, especially during moments of conflict. But the fact that Jackie created a whirlwind of unnecessary tension and animosity amongst the group so as to make herself look good/ " large and in charge " makes her exceptionally MESSY. Classic example of when " keepin ' it real " goes wrong <p> Doug has to know by now he married a psycho. I thought Jackie Christie was cool until I saw this show. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't look like a fool on national TV. We all know who really was tired of that relationship.
