5064741 <p> Time Lapse Assembler allows you to create movies from a sequence of images. Provide it with a folder containing sequentially named JPEG images and it will produce a Quicktime compatible movie file for use in iMovie or other editing software. <p> Exports MPEG, H.264, and RAW movies <p> Select between 15, 24, and 30 fps <p> If you use and enjoy this software, please consider donating a small amount to fund future development. <p> Donate <p> What 's New <p> Version 1.5.3 : Fixed an issue with framerates being different than what was specified. <p> I must be over- or under-thinking this because no matter how I set Time Lapse Assembler 1.5.3 on my OS 10.6.8 iMac to convert 48 JPEG photos of my son 's 1st grade Christmas singalong into a movie( whether at 30, 24 or 0.5 fps, Resized and/or Rescaled or not, and at any Quality), I get a 3.5 -- 12 MB. mov file that zips from start to finish in no more than 2 seconds! What am I missing? <p> Excellent. I love how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or how you can make raw video files as large as the megapixels of the photos used. <p> A couple features I hope would be included in the next version are the ability to make a time lapse in reverse order of the photo sequence and the ability to crop a photo to the desired aspect ratio rather than crop. <p> Does almost exactly what I need. Due the layer order and export function in Photoshop my image sequence is numbered backwards, so it would be hand to choose the order in which the images were shown. Highest number first or lowest number first. I 'll find some way of re exporting the images for now. Otherwise an entirely brilliant little app. <p> Works as advertised and does so very quickly. One small problem is if I uncheck resize I get a black movies although the file is fairly large. In any event good quality and easy to use while using the default settings. It would be nice to have a 10 frames a second but no biggie. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the functionality of Quicktime Pro, a $29 application, but does it for free. The open image sequence command is not available in the free version of Quicktime Player, that is why I wrote this utility. I thought others might find it useful. <p> I am having a problem rendering a timelapse video. When the final video is assembled, the video jumps frames and inserts other frames where they are not supposed to go. The original image sequence does not seem to be out of order. This is the second video I have made with TL Assembler, the first worked perfectly. Anything that I am missing that would cause this? <p> Download and auto-install using MacUpdate Desktop. Save time moving folders and cleaning-up. <p> Time Lapse Assembler allows you to create movies from a sequence of images.
