It 's the art of compromise and building a consensus. " -- Harry " Lead By Example " Reid, January 2012 In actuality, Harry Reid 's definition of " bipartisanship " is " Republicans doing what Democrats want but not the other way around. " If Mitt Romney is elected on Tuesday, Reid will continue to be true to form : <p> Five days before the election, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has ruled out trying to work with Mitt Romney should he win next week.

This leads to 52 Democratic senators and 48 Republican senators. For the Republicans to win the senate majority, assuming a tie-breaking vote of the vice president if Romney and Ryan win, they will need to win any two of the of the following close seats : Massachusetts, Virginia, Indiana, Missouri, Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and Connecticut.
