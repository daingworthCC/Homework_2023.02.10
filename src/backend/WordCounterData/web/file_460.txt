5072841 <p> As the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday approaches, Diane and her guests discuss the most pressing civil rights issues in America today. A look at what has been achieved and new challenges ahead. <p> At the recent dedication of the Martin Luther King, Jr. memorial in Washington, D.C., President Obama said the slain civil rights leader would recognize many challenges our nation faces today, including neighborhoods with underfunded schools and inadequate health care. But since Dr. King 's time, much has changed. Not only African-Americans, but women, Hispanics, and homosexuals have -- and still are -- waging civil rights campaigns. And while some problems persist, great strides have been made toward equal rights, including passage of the Americans with Disabilites Act and the ability of gays to serve openly in the military. Diane and her guests discuss civil rights in America today. <h> Related Links <h> Program Highlights <p> Forty-six years after its passage, the Voting Rights Act is still in the news.

But Bernard points out that today, we hear very little public discussion about the poor. " From my perspective today, if you look at Dr. King 's message of economic inequality, and you ask yourself what is the most important civil rights issue of today, my personal opinion is that it is education inequality, " she said. <p> Education Inequality <p> Han Van Spakovsky agrees that education inequality is a serious civil rights issue. Hispanics and African Americans often get poor educational opportunities at the elementary and middle school levels, Spakovsky said. Voucher programs have been tried in several urban areas to try to expand school choice for poor and minority families, but they are not available everywhere and can generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ID Laws <p> Another serious civil rights issue today has to do with voting. According to Wade Henderson, at least 14 states have adopted laws making it more difficult for people who would otherwise have been eligible to vote and who have voted in the past to vote again. Some have enacted stricter voter ID laws, some have made it more difficult for those providing assistance to voters at polling places to do so, and some have challenged third party registrations. Diane asked why it would be difficult for someone to present ID at a polling place, and Henderson said that about 25 percent of the African-American population does not have any photo ID. In some cases, Henderson said, people who had been able to vote for decades were denied the right to vote because they lacked a driver 's license or other photo ID. <p> Equal Rights for Homosexuals <p> " Given what we saw in New York last year, we have come far, but we have not come far enough, " Bernard said. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the state 's business and people should be free to marry, " she said. " You measure these things by a yardstick and if civil and human rights have meaning for anyone, surely they must have meaning for the gay and lesbian community, as well, " Henderson added. <h> Comments <p> Strides are being made in nearly every area of Civil Rights at present, all minorities are experiencing advancement..... except where it concerns women.

The labor of Africans in America was appropriated for the benefits of slave holders in exchange for subsistence nutrition and shelter. The lands of native Americans and Hawaiians were taken repeatedly for the economic use of whites. Over time, laws were passed to codify these advantages to whites and, most importantly, a set of beliefs was promulgated that those being discriminated against actually deserved it. It is this belief system that is still largely in place, though the expression of it has evolved to fit the socially acceptable norms of the times. However, the enormous economic disadvantage of African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans is largely unchanged and we have a new and updated American rationale for why that 's " right ". The focus on " civil rights " has only helped to conceal the great disparities in equal rights. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote : <p> Diane, please ask your panel -- By how much does the number of suspected illegal votes exceed the number of probable legal votes among previous voters likely to decline? <p> Wade Black Executive Director The Birmingham Pledge Foundation <p> January 12, 2012 - 11:45 am <p> Sheri Neuss wrote : <p> Question for today 's panel : I live in Ohio.

Everybody else who graduates at normal rates is already getting unfairly advantaged in the competition for jobs and college slots by not having to compete against black men who never got a chance. And anybody who wants to blame black boys themselves for their own failure to graduate from high school is seriously overlooking the fact that children ARE NEVER responsible for the circumstances into which they are born. <p> January 12, 2012 - 5:03 pm <p> Lana wrote : <p> RE : the trend toward the abrogation of our civil rights : <p> The threat of " terrorism " has been inappropriately expanded to the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example, the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act essentially protects corporations, drug companies, factory farms etc. from the lawful scrutiny and protests about their inhumane treatment of animals.
