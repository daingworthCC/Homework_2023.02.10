5062741 <p> It incorporates an ActiveX control that can be run either as a stand alone executable or can be called from within this purchased application. It runs correctly in the stand alone mode on Windows 7, but does not run when called within the application. <p> I do not have any specific information about the details of how the ActiveX control was written, and my question realates to possible security settings in Windows 7 that would prevent this control from running when called from the VB6 application. <h> All Replies <p> Run your Setup program by right-clicking the EXE and then click on the " Run as Administrator " menu entry. ActiveX controls must be registered using Administrator rights( not just an Administrator account). You also can disable UAC before running the Setup program
