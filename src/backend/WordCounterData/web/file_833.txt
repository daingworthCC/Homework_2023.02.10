5253041 <h> How did Darwin come up with evolution? <p> Charles Darwin did not " come up " with evolution. Evolution always existed, and Darwin rather eloquently explained one theory( or a number of theories, depending on how you read his work) on how evolution takes place. <p> during his voyage to South America on the HMS Beagle, Darwin began to notice the differences between very closely related species, as well as the specialization of other species to certain tasks. Combined with the differences of isolates species( ie those on the Galapagos Island) he observed what he thought to be evidence of the theory of natural selection. <p> Another young man was thinking along the same lines in malasia at the time, his name was Wallace, and he communicated dearly with Darwin thought the writing of " the Origin of Species ". <p> There is little dispute as to whether this stands as a viable scientific theory. There is not much that can prove it wrong, although science has continued to enhance natural selection and the other theories of evolution over time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a variety of reasons
