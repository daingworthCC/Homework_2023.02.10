His jazz-influenced singing remained internationally renowned whatever whims, fashions or innovations were introduced by new generations. In a solo career that included over 70 albums and hundreds of singles, from the late-30s until the mid-90s, Sinatra remained universally loved even as item ", " Pre-order both items ", " Pre-order all three items " <h> Editorial Reviews <p> Expanded two CD edition includes a bonus CD containing an additional 19 tracks. 2011 collection from the greatest and most famous vocalist of the last century. For the first time, Frank Sinatra 's greatest recordings for Capitol Records and his own Reprise Records have been gathered for one stellar collection. The booklet contains insightful track notes written by Frank Sinatra Jr. Features ' New York, New York ', ' Young At Heart ', ' Strangers In The Night ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 'm reviewing the superb DELUXE 2-CD box edition with all the trimmings. <p> Until now, you had to buy from either the Capitol or the Reprise catalog. Sinatra collections were one or the other. If you wanted to introduce his music to someone, you had to get one of each or skip an era. You want " New New, York, " " My Way, " or " That 's Life "? You 're going to have to lose " Come Fly with Me, " " Witchcraft, " and " One for My Baby. " Two different labels ; two different catalogs. FINALLY, they got together so here you have Sinatra from 1953( " I 've got the World on a String ") to " New York, New York. " <p> So, we finally have a definitive Sinatra 101 compilation. 23 tracks. Icing on the cake : an entire live concert from the Capitol era. I might be wrong about this but this June 9th 1957 concert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live with Nelson Riddle ; yes, they went on tour. To Seattle. <p> The first CD is as described : classic Sinatra and well chosen. " Night and Day, " for instance. The obvious choice would be the Capitol swinging version. Here, the choice was the later, slower, Don Costa arrangement from the 1961 " Sinatra and Strings " album( Reprise). <p> The liner notes are by Frank Sinatra Jr. They 're sharp, insightful, and written by a musician who knows this music. Example : " ' Fly Me to the Moon ' : A complete misnomer! The correct title of this popular standard is ' In Other Words. " But nobody refers to it by that name. " That 's sort of important. Sinatra Jr. has a lot to say about this music. Lots of perspective. <p> The packaging in the Deluxe Edition is exemplary, tasteful, retrained, and appropriate. Someone is making sure Sinatra 's music is presented decently. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue foil lettering and the layout of this release is a thrill. It 's like they 're serving up class. The box feels and looks suave. The box lid pulls up and was a minor nightmare to pry up - a little too tight.( Right - like that 's why I bought this.) CDs are in separate cardboard sleeves, like mini-LPs. There 's no plastic here, at all. This is the real stuff - paper and cardboard. First class design. Bravo, somebody. <p> Five square photos of Sinatra that cover the years the music recorded during are a nice addition - but this is an extra ; I 'm not sure what to do with them. <p> I have to apologise for another reviewer who did n't see the point of a live concert performance by Sinatra. That reviewer actually wrote he did n't like live recordings and so opted for the 1-CD release of " The Best of the Best. " <p> That reviewer has my sympathy because the live 1957 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prime. The sound quality is wonderful - this does n't sound like a crappy " historic " bootleg. Sinatra is SO relaxed. He just flows through the quieter material and digs into the livelier stuff. Nelson Riddle and Sinatra 's pianist, Bill Miller, are there with him. Live. This is a good as it gets - this is as good he HE gets. These are n't studio recordings. The same arrangements and musicians but now they 've settled into the music. The live performance, a full hour long, is reason alone to justify this release. I was n't about to buy the same recordings again. Even if it 's in the latest **37;619;TOOLONG format, there 's no reason for ME to grab everything that says " Frank Sinatra " on the cover. <p> But this, this is wonderful. If you 're just getting into Sinatra, sure, buy the single CD release. If you 're already a resident of Sinatraville, then buy the Deluxe Edition - they made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Concert on my Amazon wish list for two years, but never got it because it was out of print, and never went below $50. Needless to say, when I found out it was on this deluxe edition, I was ecstatic. I resisted buying the regular edition locally, and made myself wait until the mailman brought it, and was I glad I did. There are many concerts available from Vegas in the 60 's, and from many places in the 80 's( when charm assisted the instrument) but very few legit recordings from Sinatra 's vocal prime of the late 50 's. And of course, he did n't haul Nelson Riddle around too much either, as he lugged Nelson and his recording musicians up the coast to Seattle. At times, the Voice seems a little weak( " One For My Baby " is mostly whispered) but is that the Crown Royal talking they got that week from Canada, or is it because he was just so darn good in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it 's a heck of a ride. It 's especially nice to hear songs that were n't always standard fare, like the Dorsey era " Oh! Look at Me Now " " The Tender Trap " and a trilogy from Songs For Young Lovers. <p> As for " Best of the Best " it 's a fine Beginning Sinatra 101 course, with both the Capitol and Reprise in historical order. I drove 90 miles in an ice storm to hear Frank Jr. tell the stories that are in these liner notes. Frank-o-philes could stand here all day debating what is truly " best of the best " especially in the Capitol section( c'mon, no " Moonlight In Vermont? ") but it 's a hoot having Witchcraft and My Way on the same CD for once. <p> My only gripe is the Fort Knox packaging on the deluxe edition. Very hard to grip the two cardboard sleeves in the tight CD-sized box. But otherwise, a first-class collection " all the way. " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prolific recording career the numbers are simply staggering. Frank had his first big hit as lead vocalist of the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra in 1940 with " I 'll Never Smile Again ". Sinatra would go solo just a couple of years later. Over the next four decades Frank would amass an astonishing total of 145 hit singles including such memorable hits as " The Lady Is A Tramp ", " Come Fly With Me ", " Strangers In the Night " and of course his signature tune " My Way ". Now for the very first time Frank 's most popular sides from his salad days at Capitol have been combined with all of those great 1960 's hits at Reprise. " Frank Sinatra : Best of the Best( Deluxe Edition) " offers up an impressive 23 track disc featuring the greatest hits from the prime of Frank 's fabulous career. And for just a few dollars more than the basic edition the folks at Capitol have thrown in a lot of extra goodies that will delight collectors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to be a very popular holiday and birthday gift for quite some time to come. <p> After a decade at Columbia Records Frank Sinatra made the move to Capitol in the spring of 1953. Most Sinatra afficianados will argue that he did his finest work while at Capitol. " Frank Sinatra : Best of the Best( Deluxe Edition) " offers up more than a dozen of these memorable tunes many of which were among the biggest hits of the 1950 's. Enjoy once again great hits like " Young-At-Heart ", " All The Way " and " Love and Marriage " from 1955 which younger listeners will recognize as the theme from the popular FOX TV series " Married... With Children ". While at Capitol Frank made a number of unforgettable recordings with the legendary arranger, composer, bandleader and orchestrator Nelson Riddle. You can sample at least a half dozen of these songs right here including his big 1958 hit " Witchcraft ", " All the Way ", " You Make Me Feel So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's finest performances ever " I 've Got You Under My Skin ". Trust me folks it simply does not get any better than that one! <p> Frank Sinatra would leave the cozy confines of Capitol Records in 1960 and launched his very own record label. He called it Reprise. One of the label 's founding principles under Sinatra 's leadership was that each artist would have full creative freedom, and at some point complete ownership of their work including publishing rights. It was a noble idea but unfortunately things did not pan out the way Frank had hoped. In 1963 Frank sold the label to Warner Brothers but remained on board as an artist. Sinatra continued to churn out successful LP 's but it had been awhile since he had a hit single. That all changed in early 1966 when he teamed up once again with Nelson Riddle and recorded the album " Strangers In the Night ". Not only did the album soar to the top of the Billboard album charts but the single did as well! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a whole new generation or record-buyers. Frank had a number of other hit singles in the 1960 's including " Summer Wind ", " It Was A Very Good Year " and one of my all-time favorites " That 's Life " from 1966. You will find them all on " Best of the Best ". Add to that the aforementioned Grammy Award winning " My Way " and Frank 's final hit single " Theme from New York, New York " from 1980 and what you have is an extraordinarily entertaining collection by the man many consider to be the greatest entertainer of the 20th century. <p> As I mentioned earlier this is the first time that Frank Sinatra 's Capitol and Reprise hits have been included on the same CD. Rest assured that these are all the original recordings that have been lovingly remastered for your enjoyment. As an added bonus " Frank Sinatra : Best of the Best( Deluxe Edition) " includes a bonus disc featuring Frank 's long out-of print " Live in ' 57 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that lots of Sinatra afficianados will appreciate the opportunity to own this rare recording. Personally I am not a big fan of " live " recordings so I opted for the less expensive basic 23 track single disc collection which was released on the very same day. Either way you simply ca n't go wrong with this one. " Frank Sinatra : Best of the Best( Deluxe Edition) " would be a splendid gift for that senior on your list or perhaps for a younger person who may have never even heard of Frank Sinatra. Perhaps they will discover why " Ol ' Blue Eyes " was so popular for
