5028641 <h> To The Guy Who Thought It Was Funny to Shoot Me With a Paintball Gun on the Santa Fe Trail : You 're a Dick <p> Will my arm ever be the same? Also, my arm is much more muscular than it appears in this picture. Swear. <p> Just after 8 o'clock this morning, I was riding to work, as I always do, along the Sante Fe Trail. I 'd just passed Woodrow and was riding along the fields at Randall Park when I heard pop, pop on my left. It sounded like when a squirrel drops a half-eaten pecan to the ground, but it obviously was n't since that particular stretch is treeless. What it was, I learned when I felt the bee sting on my arm and glanced at the black Cadillac El Dorado( or maybe Seville) matching my pace along Santa Fe Ave, a kid, maybe 18, tracking me with a paintball gun through the open passenger window. <p> I casually gave him the finger as I rode then, after he shot me twice more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, much more emphatically this time. This was satisfying, I guess, but not very smart since it meant that I did n't see the yellow metal pylon straight ahead of me.

He nodded and stood there until I got up and took a few ginger steps on my leg. It was fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bike. I hopped back on and headed back and take a shower. <p> Along the way, I ran into two bike cops where the trail cuts by Lakewood Country Club. I told them what had happened, then rode back with them to where I 'd wiped out. They talked with the pylon guy, who had n't seen much, and told me they had three squad cars patrolling the neighborhood. I 'm sure DPD will pull out all the stops to catch a couple of dickhead kids who think shooting bicyclists with paintball guns is funny. Certainly they do n't have anything more important on their plates. <p> Update at 11:06 p.m. : The peanut butter sandwich that I 'd packed for lunch this morning is missing, having apparently fallen
