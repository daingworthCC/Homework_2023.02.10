Grief, terror, love, longing--these were intangibles, but the intangibles had their own mass and specific gravity, they had tangible weight. They carried shameful memories. They carried the common secret of cowardice.... Men killed, and died, because they were embarrassed not to. " <p> A finalist for both the 1990 Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but definitive line of demarcation between Tim O'Brien 's earlier works about Vietnam, the memoir If I Die in a Combat Zone and the fictional Going After Cacciato, and this sly, almost hallucinatory book that is neither memoir nor novel nor collection of short stories but rather an artful combination of all three. Vietnam is still O'Brien 's theme, but in this book he seems less interested in the war itself than in the myriad different perspectives from which he depicts it. Whereas Going After Cacciato played with reality, The Things They Carried plays with truth. The narrator of most of these stories is " Tim " ; yet O'Brien freely admits that many of the events he chronicles in this collection never really happened. He never killed a man as " Tim " does in " The Man I Killed, " and unlike Tim in " Ambush, " he has no daughter named Kathleen. But just because a thing never happened does n't make it any less true. In " On the Rainy River, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving north, to the Canadian border where he spends six days in a deserted lodge in the company of an old man named Elroy while he wrestles with the choice between dodging the draft or going to war. The real Tim O'Brien never drove north, never found himself in a fishing boat 20 yards off the Canadian shore with a decision to make. The real Tim O'Brien quietly boarded the bus to Sioux Falls and was inducted into the United States Army. But the truth of " On the Rainy River " lies not in facts but in the genuineness of the experience it depicts : both Tims went to a war they did n't believe in ; both considered themselves cowards for doing so. Every story in The Things They Carried speaks another truth that Tim O'Brien learned in Vietnam ; it is this blurred line between truth and reality, fact and fiction text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title. <h> From Publishers Weekly <p> Weapons and good-luck charms carried by U.S. soldiers in Vietnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interminable legacy.

His other works include the acclaimed novels The Things They Carried and July, July. In the Lake of the Woods received the James Fenimore Cooper Prize from the Society of American Historians and was named the best novel of 1994 by Time. O'Brien lives in Austin, Texas. <p> Tim O'Brien 's " The Things They Carried " is a book that transcends the genre of war fiction. Actually, it transcends the genre of fiction in general. Although labeled " a work of fiction " on the title page, the book really combines aspects of memoir, novel, and short story collection. I think you could use Audre Lorde 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first-person narrator of this book( named, like the author, Tim O'Brien) is a writer and combat veteran of the Vietnam War. The book actually deals with events before and after the war, in addition to depicting the war itself ; the time span covers more than 30 years in the lives of O'Brien and his fellow soldiers. <p> " The Things They Carried " is an intensely " writerly " text. By that I mean that O'Brien and his characters often reflect directly on the activities of storytelling and writing. As a reader, I got the sense that I was being invited into the very process by which the book was created. This is an extraordinary technique, and O'Brien pulls it off brilliantly. <p> This being a war story, there are some truly disturbing, graphic, and violent scenes. But there are also scenes that are haunting, funny, surreal, or ironic. O'Brien depicts a memorable group of soldiers : the guilt-wracked Lieut. Cross ; Kiowa, a Native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playful Azar ; and more. <p> While this book is a complete and cohesive work of art, many of its component stories could stand alone as independent pieces of literature( in fact, I first encountered the title story in an anthology). But however you classify it, I consider " The Things They Carried " to be a profoundly moving masterpiece. <p> I was first introduced to this book as part of a U.S. &; Vietnam History course in college. The other novel the course required was The Quiet American by Graham Greene. Tim O'Brien 's book is every bit as good as Greene 's, and all the more timely. <p> As a former soldier, and a veteran of Desert Storm, whose father avoided the draft during the Vietnam War, the book taught me that no matter what other people say about the war, no matter what I learn, I can never make any value judgements on an individual level. I was not there, and for better or worse, I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book, which I often use in teaching my creative writing class. I share the story-chapter, " Style " every year with my students. I also find the book essential to learn about the nature of fiction, which O'Brien challenges with every page of this book. <p> For anyone looking for a book to read on the Vietnam experience, this book makes my short list every time. Not only of " Vietnam " books, but of any book worth reading. This book is simply essential. <p> I was born in 1969. I missed Vietnam. The war was over and I never knew about it. For an event that had such significance in American history, it was as though it had never happened. <p> When I was in High School and we studied American History, our class always ended with WWII. We never discussed " modern " events -- the 60s, the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights movement. <p> When I got to college, I made a point of taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained a textbook introduction to the Vietnam war -- I never had a true sense of what the horror was, why people protested, why it was such an important historical event. My generation has never faced a war in which we were drafted to fight. <p> And then I read " The Things they Carried "... <p> This book was/is an education for me. Visceral, haunting, provoking, gripping -- the stories Tim O'Brien tells rip into you. He puts you on the front line facing the man you just killed -- on the Canadian border deciding that you are n't brave enough to escape to Canada to avoid the draft -- back in Vietnam watching your best buddy slowly sink into a field of mud as sniper fire rains all around you -- back at home with no sense of purpose surrounded by people who do n't know how to welcome you home. <p> This book is the best education on Vietnam this literal child of the 60s ever received. <p> If, like me, you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this book and you will... <p> I taught this book in my( all girls) high school Contemporary Authors class a few years ago( 11-12) and will be teaching it again beginning next week. One of the most surprising and unexpected results of the novel for me was the number of fathers
