5100741 <h> The State of Iowa <p> Welcome to Iowa, the Hawkeye State. With its fertile, rolling prairies, Iowa is one of the foremost farming states in the United States. One fifth of the nation 's corn harvest is produced in Iowa. Wet springs combined with warm summers create a favorable environment for plantings of corn and soybeans in the state 's top-grade farmland. Although agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, Iowa has also encouraged the growth of manufacturing and service industries. <p> If you are going to have large farms, you might as well ensure that you have the right equipment to work those farms, and in that spirit Iowa produced the first gasoline-powered tractor in 1892( John Froelich, Clayton County). Today, the state claims the largest tractor manufacturing plant in the U.S. <p> The state of Iowa, originally a territory of Wisconsin west of the Mississippi River, was named after the Iowa River. <p> The Iowa River was named after the Iowa Indians who lived in the territory. The tribal name " Ayuxwa " was spelled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " Ioway. " " Ayuxwa " means " one who puts to sleep. " <h> The Hawkeye State <p> This popular nickname for the state of Iowa is said to have come from the scout, Hawkeye, in James Fenimore Cooper 's The Last of the Mohicans published in 1826. According to the Iowa State web site, " Two Iowa promoters from Burlington are believed to have popularized the name. " The nickname was given approval by " territorial officials " in 1838, twelve years after the book was published and eight years before Iowa became a state. <p> The two men responsible for the promotion of this nickname are thought to be Judge David Rorer of Burlington and the newspaper publisher, James G. Edwards of Fort Madison and, later, Burlington. Burlington had been established in 1833 after the Black Hawk War of 1832. Mr. Edwards changed the name of his Burlington newspaper, The Iowa Patriot, to The Hawk-Eye and Iowa Patriot in tribute to his friend Chief Black Hawk. Judge Rorer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding the name in The Last of the Mohicans while Mr. Edwards proposed the nickname " Hawk-eyes " in 1838 to "... rescue from oblivian sic a momento sic, at least of the name of the old chief, " Black Hawk. <p> The Iowa quarter is the fourth of 2004, and the 29th in the 50 State Quarters r Program. On December 28, 1846, Iowa became the 29th state to be admitted into the Union. The Iowa quarter design features a one-room schoolhouse with a teacher and students planting a tree, and the inscriptions " Foundation in Education " and " Grant Wood. " The design is based on " Arbor Day, " a painting by Grant Wood, who was born near Anamosa, Iowa. He spent his career as a proponent of small-town values, which he celebrated in the iconic images of small-town plain folk and verdant Midwestern vistas for which he is world-renowned. <p> Iowans have had a commitment to education since the State 's earliest days.

Iowa established its first high school in the 1850s, although high schools generally did not become widespread in the United States until after 1900. Private and public colleges also quickly took root in the new State. <p> Although Iowa has long been a leader in agriculture, the State is unique in that it is the only one whose east and west borders are completely formed by rivers - the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. <p> In May 2002, Governor Thomas J. Vilsack established the 16-member Iowa Quarter Commission, which worked with libraries, banks and credit unions to solicit ideas and concepts for the state quarter design. The Commission received nearly 2,000 submissions, which were narrowed to five candidate themes, including " American Gothic, " " Foundation in Education, " " Feeding the World, " " Sullivan Brothers, " and " Beautiful Land. " <p> In July 2003, the United States Mint forwarded five approved candidate designs to Governor Vilsack for final recommendation. Three designs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and the other two represented the " Young Corn " and " Foundation in Education " concepts.
