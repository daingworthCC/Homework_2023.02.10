5027341 <h> Wednesday, May 23, 2012 <h> A note about recent changes <p> There 's always a lot going on here at YouTube, and we 're constantly making changes to improve the experience for the entire community. In the last seven years there have been no fewer than 100 changes to the suggested and recommended video algorithms to provide viewers with the most relevant videos to watch. We also make changes to improve the experience for partners. Recently, we 've made changes to provide you with more accurate data about your audience, which in turn helps inform the decisions you make about your content. In the short term, however, the impact for some creators can be a bit of a shock. Let 's outline what we 've done, and what 's in it for you. <p> Subscriber counts : In the past few months we have been scrubbing YouTube of inactive and closed accounts. Why? Because these accounts had been inactive for years, were not linked to our more up-to-date and secure systems, and, well, nobody uses them. This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in subscribers. However, this change benefits partners in the long term by giving you a better understanding of who is engaging with your channel. Accurate data is key, and as such, we will now be removing accounts from subscriber counts as they are closed. As the accounts are inactive, these changes wo n't affect viewership. <p> Starting this Saturday, your subscriber counts on your channel and in Analytics will be consistent, and Analytics will show you closed accounts that have been removed : <p> We 've also heard some viewers are concerned that they 've been unsubscribed from channels. This is n't happening. You can see all your channel subscriptions by selecting and saving ' Everything ' from the view drop-down : <p> View count changes : Back in March, we announced changes to the algorithm that serves up suggested and recommended videos, giving greater weight to a viewer 's time spent on a video, rather than to their click. We did this because flipping through channels to find something to watch is different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagement are more useful. What does this mean for you? Well, if people are clicking on your videos, but not sticking around to watch, your videos wo n't get shown as often in suggested and recommended videos and growth in new views may slow. The best way to prevent this is to create compelling videos that people stick around for. Also check out the the Analytics Audience Retention Report and these optimization tips for how to drive engaged views to your videos. <p> While transitions can be hard, the data directly resulting from these changes is really encouraging : net daily subscriptions are up 50% since January and watch time has been increasing in the past 2 months. We 're investing to grow this this even more over the next year as we spend more than $200 million to promote our partners ' content. YouTube creators comprise the most passionate, diverse and talented community in the world. Our mission is to give you the tools and data you need to be successful. <h> 123 comments : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have it as Everything permanently! No one wants to lose videos they 've subscribed for. And while you 're at it why not bring back the " most subscribed " list. I 'm sick of having to go on another external site just to see who 's in the top spot etc. <p> Very True, "... viewers are concerned that they 've been unsubscribed from channels. This is n't happening. " This is complete bull shit. It is proven not only by users but also with the top YouTubers of all time who pretty much run this website. EVERYONES views were affected. ACTIVE subscribers were automatically unsubscribed. <p> There is a quite simple solution to this problem but either google wo n't put it in place or have n't even considered it, the solution would be that a person who has monetized their videos does n't have the ads showing when they watch their own videos. This can also be done with a system put in place that prevents users from clicking an ad more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a user leaves more than one comment in quick succession. Ok so people can click ads who are not even logged in but it would make it such hard work for a click bomber that it would n't be worth their trouble, there are lots of solutions to this problem but it seems to me google wont take action against the guilty and punish the account holder of the said adsense account instead <p> Please make the default for subscriptions " EVERYTHING " and not " HIGHLIGHTS " - by subscribing to someone, I am telling YouTube that this is what I 'd like to be highlighted on my homepage. It makes no sense for YouTube to decide which people that I 'm subscribed to are more important than the others. <p> I made a video about this issue when it was first introduced, it was also something i brought up many times in feedback to youtube, i stand with everyone who has requested that default is set to everything. The other problem with the homepage feed is the lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feed, we had it with the old layout so why cant we have it in the new <p> I understand getting rid of inactive/unused accounts. But there have been MANY reports, including from my own subscribers, that they are being unsubscribed unknowingly. I asked yesterday if anyone noticed if they 're not longer subscribed, to which I had at least one. Many other more popular youtubers have voiced the same problem. <p> I honestly do n't think people do n't like cosmic panda, it was perfect before it changed... I still hate the fact that I ca n't close out videos that I 've already watched to filter out the old while leaving the one 's that I have n't watched on the main page. <p> whilst I like the recommended videos most of them are now duplicates, even x'ing them off does n't remove them from the list... even when you know what I 've watched you still suggest them. Bring back the most subscribed. Default to all videos. Have an option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide screens... Christ I have dead space on the left and the right of the screen. Let me X of a video from my feed like I used to be able to( eg) I probably only watch 1 in 10 Machinima videos). <p> I have had subscribers unsubscribed youtube. Do not give that " We 've also heard some viewers are concerned that they 've been unsubscribed from channels. This is n't happening. You can see all your channel subscriptions by selecting and saving ' Everything ' from the view drop-down : " <p> I agree with the above. The issue with ' Highlights ' is nothing more an an annoyance to me. I can see the idea of where ' Highlights ' was thought to be a good idea, however ' Everything ' is more of a classic look that allows users to see what videos have come from those they have subscribed to. ' Highlights ' can be a good way to allow those who do n't have enough time to watch videos for long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a permanent default. having ' Everything ' as the default, and having ' Highlights ' as a secondary, and available feature in settings would work much better. <p> Allow more customization please, and do consider these thoughts. I do n't enjoy having to switch to ' Everything ' everytime i pop on YouTube. Thank you. <p> There is no good reason to default to Highlights. I 'm constantly surprised at how YouTube consistently working against the interests of its users, limiting their options and ignoring their requests, while being incredibly secretive about motives behind changes and upcoming updates. It 's behaviour unlike any other website I 've seen, and is horribly irritating. <p> As always I really appreciate your team NOTICING us all complaining. However to avoid the fact and deny that people are being unsubbed randomly is just wrong. Many popular YouTubers have posted proof on their Twitter and Facebook proving it is really happening. For your team to deny this is a big slap in the face. Just own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on. <p> ugh ok. thank you for the post and updating us BUT you are actually deleting ACTIVE subscribers from all of us!! thousands of people have reported it and PROVED it. i tweeted to my followers and asked them to check and see if they were still subbed to me and i had several people right away tell me that they were no longer subbed to me and it was without their doing. so i understand you want to get rid of the inactive accounts, BUT whatever process you are using to do this is extremely flawed and is KILLING US. PLEASE listen to us when we tell you this because it is actually happening and people are voicing it and proving it left and right. it is SO frustrating to work our butt off to gain this audience, and then only to lose so many of them( ACTIVE) in just a week. i do n't know how i am going to be able to get a lot of these ACTIVE subscriber back once this purge is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. i ca n't even go on youtube right now because i just get upset every time i go to my channel. youtube i am literally BEGGING you to please fix this! i do not want to lose anymore ACTIVE subscribers. please listen to us and fix this before it gets any worse... <p> My thoughts EXACTLY! I feel SO discouraged right now, cause I 've worked my BUTT off, to get my channel where it is today. : / &; youtube are trying to say we 're lying, even when it 's been blatantly proven, is a kick RIGHT in the face, of us all. <p> I can prove it easily. I have been subbed to a guy called ZephyrnixLive for a ling time now. I went to my subscription page and I clicked on recommendations, and he 's listed in my recommendations with a subscribe button! I check my list and sure as the world, he 's no longer on there. Noticed this about five minutes ago. <p> Too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the default tab instead of ' Everything '. I find this feature to be almost pointless. If you 're NOT going to REMOVE it, at least change the default to EVERYTHING. <p> agreed, I have barely been on youtube since this started, it 's driving me insane and even though i worked out within the first minute about the highlights thing, I subbed to people so I could easily access their content, not have them more or less blocked from my homepage, i mean, it 's almost censorship <p> Love4MusicUK you maybe right. i do nt think youtube know what to do. they cant do any more to make web site better. if any thing. fix the bug, remove and auto program they got in the web or make there old tool better like the video editor. but do nt play god with people sub. -. - <p> If you ask me, I think Youtube is actually doing this as a way to try and stop the whole " buy fake subs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, where you pay some guy 100 bucks and he uses a bot program to make the ten thousand or so sock accounts he 's made to sub to you and post comments in your vids and what not to make it look like an active sub. But they screwed up their algorithm so its killing live subs as well. Again, with emphasis, if it was having highlights selected instead of everything, they would n't have to be going to my channel page and clicking the subscribe button again. They would n't even HAVE a subscribe button, it would be an unsubscribe button! <p> Totally scott I loved the x out feature. I want to be able to delete the videos I watched so I can tell what I have n't watched yet. I go to my new videos screen to do this instead sometimes it does n't delete videos I would love this feature back. <p> Auto-Unsunscribing IS happening. I am victim of this myself with some of my Subscriptions and it 's only because I visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Subscribed. We 're not dumb, YouTube. I do n't know why you are denying this is hapening, but the fact is IT IS. Hundreds, if not thousands of people have been affected. You need to fix this before it 's too late and the content creators leave YouTube all together. I myself have experienced a growing rate of Subscribers, but yet my Subscription number keeps on dropping - what the heck? Also the Homepage Subscription feed needs to be defaulted to ' Everything ' cause my Subscribers are not getting all of my content. Please fix this. <p> Please either make the default " everything " or get rid of the " highlights " option. I subscribed to channels for a reason--I want to see ALL of their videos. I do n't want to miss videos because I did n't realize that " highlights " was checked. At the very least, make it so that " everything " stays checked and does n't revert to " highlights " every day. <p> I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been automatically unsubscribed from me! I am losing around 1000 subscribers a day so I really do hope they are all in fact dead accounts and not people still using the site! <p> So over a 1000 lost subs and no new ones being added is not the issue according to you? So what is happening with my new subs telling me they have not been added and have been removed? You have a bug on your hands. The sooner you realise and acknowledge that the better for Youtube and me. <p> I have to agree on the comments regarding the view options ; the default makes no sense. What makes it even worse is the fact that it is hidden behind an inconspicuous menu that does n't show the current setting until you click on it. <p> Also, like TrindeLLian, I 'm still not a fan of the new Comic Panda layout. For example, I remember way back, when I was ye high, we could see up to 10( 12?) new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them, 2 when not closing the ad. <p> I understand the idea behind the changes, as well as the importance of aesthetics, but I feel the site 's usability has dropped dramatically in the last few months. <p> I would n't mind the highlights option if it was actually showing me the channels I watch the most. Right now it usually hides the users I always always always click to see their new video, and its bringing back obscure channels I once subscribed to and now rarely actually watch. <p> I have LITERALLY pages of visual proof that people have been unsubscribed to my channel unwillfully, tons of comments from viewers who have testified they will subscribe to me one day only to be unsubscribed the next( as in, the subscribe button will be yellow saying to " subscribe " instead of " unsubscribe " as it should if they were already subscribed). <p> My account is http : **33;2488;TOOLONG and this glitch has cost me thousands of subscribers now, I have boatloads of emails from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate for proof of this. <p> Please do n't say people are n't being unsubscribed when 5 minutes on any big youtuber 's comment sections for a given video say otherwise. <p> How can you guys CLAIM it is n't happening, and we 're lying, when you see ALL these people making video 's, and complaining about it, on twitter?? I mean, how can you guys even CONSIDER yourselves " Youtube " anymore.. When you 've practically tooken the " You " out of " Youtube?? " : / <p> Every stinkin ' time I get on any " site " something 's " changed "! " Could n't match the user name with password, that one is already being used, a new way to " post photos ", you 're going to like this new timeline, instead of this.. do this, and go to that to find out how to do this, then go to start and run this and that will show you how to download this and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adobe Flash to show you how to upload the new version of Windows 444444.44 million. " It 'll only take a couple seconds " It 's a bunch of GARBAGE! I hate this thing! <p> Why is it that we can no longer get our subscriptions achieve in full. Someone explain to me why past videos are not showing up? All these changes you re making to youtube and google are just gon na destroy the internet 's best search engine. <p> Why are no responses from YOU TUBE. What is this, some top-down operation where you push out your information then clam up and let the little people fuss amongst themselves. Where the hell is your social media. You people are terrible representatives of the culture you are trying to " sell " new subscribers -- interaction. <p> But we HAVE been losing subscribers from ACTIVE accounts. This has been proven by many Youtubers, including myself. I posted about it on my Twitter and Facebook, and some people had to resubscribe. Not cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YouTube homepage to go to your subscriptions. Click on your own channel name, go to subscriptions from there and you get everything in a nice 4 column layout with no recommended videos or anything. Make a shortcut in your browser and you 're all set. I 've been doing it this way for years and all my subscriptions show up. <p> I wish Youtube would just tell the truth. I 've had subscribers tell me that they were unsubbed to my channel without their knowledge. They told me before I even discovered it. All of them re-subbed back. This is going to come back to haunt Youtube. You ca n't conduct a business model this way without losing the base that made you what you are. It happened to Netflix, and it will happen to you. Also, I thought you were supposed to have this purging over and done with by February. It seems never ending, and it 's really disheartening for people who work so hard. I really do n't think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you care about profit and the bottom line. <p> Also, you are not ' improving the experience ' for the Youtube community as your blog states. You are killing them with a thousand paper cuts. I 'd prefer if Youtube would just get this subscriber purge over with quickly. People would rather know how many subscribers they 're losing( immediately) rather than have to wait for weeks to know that it 's finally over with. <p> ok. this getting very old. again i have someone who just sub to me got push off my sub list. THIS REALLY NEED TO BE FIX. how do your blog help anyone( o.O) do you real think people making this stuff up just for the heath. <p> YOU ARE FUCKING IDIOTS YOUTUBE. YOUVE JUST INSULTED EVERYONE ON YOUTUBE. PEOPLE ARE LOSING THEIR SUBS. YOU PUT OUT THIS BULLSHIT?? YOU BIG SHOTS ON YOUTUBE, go watch this video, http : //www.youtube.com/watch? v=ZPK... Youve insulted people by saying " We 've also heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channels. This is n't happening. " There has even been a picture on Twitter, of a person who lost EVERYSSINGLE ONE of the people he subbed to. He logged on and it told him he had no subscribers. Fix your fucking Website and stop telling people that were stupidd, click this, itll fix everything. WE are not childs. Go watch the video. <p> I ca n't believe YouTube would think that their own users would n't even know how to use the site. This is lazy and unprofessional of the entire YouTube creators. If YouTube would focus on improving their customer to business relationship instead of implementing useless changes to their site, they would get a lot more done. <p> Telling long-time site users and creators... some of which have views and subscriptions in the MILLIONS... that their users are n't getting un-subbed to their channels against their will? Even though we 've received thousands of such messages from our fans? THEN suggesting that the fix is to look at a drop-down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know how to use the site? <p> Unprofessional, insulting, and wrong. An apology is owed to your Userbase for this blog post. <p> This is n't a glitch? Give me a break... You guys are basically flipping off all of us users who are trying to help you to fix these bugs we 've found. <p> Clean up your mess, and stop playing this condescending little game. It 's very, VERY unprofessional of whoever is responsible to even post an article like this. Fix the frigging problem and come clean with the fact that you messed up. That 's all we ask. <p> I do n't care who it is that wrote this... it 's downright rude, and totally unacceptable to all of us long time users of the site. Fix the problem, and say you 're sorry for this absurdly insulting post. <p> I can even deal with the forced channel layouts, but when the site I 've been uploading to for the past four years decides to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, thats when I draw the line. Enough is enough. We are n't idiots. <p> You guys really love to piss off your fans. I 've been in YouTube for six years but have been doing game videos for more than five. What you guys are doing is unacceptable, disrespectful and insulting to your consumers and all who use YouTube. <p> All I want to say is this... FIX YOUR SHIT NOW!!! I 'm sick of losing subscribers and I 'm totally sick of having to deal with your excuses and lies. I 've made a video about it and so have many others. Do us a favor and fix your shit! FIX IT DAMN IT! Not to mention... you owe ALL OF US an apology. Got that? <p> This WHOLE article, is a MAJOR insult, to us long timer USERS. WE KNOW wtf is happening, or else we would n't be BITCHING &; CONSTANTLY COMPLAINING ABOUT IT!! You 're taking us for fools, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had ALL the got damn proof you need, on the site itself, and threw twitter. What else do you need?? &; for that matter, how can you be SO stupid, to keep asking for " Proof " and saying it 's not happening?? SERIOUSLY?? HOW MUCH MORE, DO YOU HONESTLY NEED?!?! I worked hard on my channel for 3 YEARS STRAIGHT, TO GET THE VIEWS I GOTTEN, AND TO GET THE SUBS I GOT. Now, I 'm slowly watching it go down the drain, cause you " monkeys ".. wan na just brush this off as us lying, and it 's not happening. If this is purging, then do the shit in one GO, AND NOT DAY BY DAY, HOUR BY HOUR AND MINute BY MINUTE!! I 've lost views, I 'm losing SUBS, and now losing HOPE, that I 'll ever make vids again, if this stupid glitch/problem DOES N'T come fixed!! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you guys, your response, would have been differently put. REAL TALK!! <p> And what happened to our long bios? It took me a week to think of everything! I want that back! In fact, I think it would be easier if the old YouTube channel were still around! Nothing was wrong with it! If it ai n't broke, do n't bother fixin ' it! And you guys are wasting time with this! Too much change! We ca n't keep up! No wonder people are closing their accounts... <p> Bull. If it was just the subscription view, the people who have PM 'd me saying they were unsubbed to my channel would not have had to go to my channel page and click the Subscribe button to get me back on their list. Explain how not having EVERYTHING selected on the subscription page would cause them to go to my channel page and the button at the top says Subscribe instead of unsubscribe so they have to click subscribe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blog post. <p> " Starting this Saturday, your subscriber counts on your channel and in Analytics will be consistent, and Analytics will show you closed accounts that have been removed "... <p> So how can you be sure that on Saturday, that it 'll be consistent? How can you prove that you do n't have yet ANOTHER glitch. <p> I mean really... this is the same youtube that, just very recently, for at least a week they had a huge glitch where most people receieved " Content ID Claim " even though they had none, then their 15 minute limit were taken away for no good reason. <p> People are n't as dumb as you seem to think... if hundreds of folks actually say ' Yes, I got unsubbed and I had to sub back ', do you just think they 're just making it up or being ignorant? <p> Again... you guys just had a huge, tremendous glitch where hundreds and hundreds of people, just out of the blue, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a GLITCH from YOUTUBE &; GOOGLE... not us the Users. <p> So please, explain to us how you can be SURE that this Saturday it 'll be steady, that this is n't another glitch like you just had recently, that you 're NOT getting active subs kicked off when they have SAID( by hundreds of folks telling others ' hey, i got unsubbed to you '. Cause that little trick you said up above... it does n't work! So yes, it IS happening. <p> I mean no offense, but maybe youtube and Google should grow up and act like the billion dollar business that they are, instead of just going " It 's not us, it 's YOU ". <p> I noticed that I was unsubscribed from a few a people and did n't unsubscribe from them myself. I want to see my subscriptions so I have all of the videos posted sent to my email. I would love to have the youtube sub box that we had where we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them. It uncluttered my sub box and seeing as I 'm subscribed to over 240 channels videos are posted all the time and are easily lost. We should have a choice to make ' highlights ' or ' everything ' default it should n't automatically go to ' highlights ' as other people have said I subscribed to channels to see the content they put out. Also another problem I 've notice is the big youtubers losing tons of views like Mysteryguitarman his videos used to get a million or more views and now he 's lucky if they reach 500,000 and that 's really bad seeing as he has over 2 million subscribers <p> I had to comment on this again because this is really starting to piss me off. Do you have any idea that what you are doing is going to end up killing not just my channel but many others. Go to hell YouTube. Go. To. Fucking. Hell! <p> Why is it that no one who works at YouTube knows how this website really works and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hire an actual content producer to be on their team. When I meet them at VidCon and PlaylistLive I always feel like I have a way better understanding of what 's going on than they do! <p> One thing I would like is for YouTube to allow when you go to your new subscriptions page to be able to delete videos you have already watched currently you have to click on the video to delete but that does n't always work. I also like to create playlists of videos I do n't have time to watch now to watch later. I would like to be able to put those videos into my playlist in a simpler way now maybe just checkmark a mass bunch and put in a playlist and make it easier to delete videos <p> so now you finally realised that us users lost their subscribers! here is my fucking story based on truth you greedy cheating son of a bitch, on my youtube channel " MrATAndreiThomas " at first i had 11,100 subscribers and now it dropped down to 9,404 as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!! you make me so sick! my viewership is going fucking slow, to point i hate you with a passion. <p> do you know how fucking long i been building up my channel? every fucking month from the last 2 years when i had my channel and the present. you can suck my black cockney londoner fucking dick and fuck off. <p> Seems to me that every time we get a new subscriber we loose subscribers, i 've just checked my e mail in box and it shows around 100 new subscribers this week, subscriber count has nt gone up on my channel but gone down by around the same amount as who have subscribed, the new subscribers are not being added to the count. I do n't believe for a second these are old or inactive accounts being deleted as i reg check my subscriber list and check if the channels are still active, it 's something i 've always done in my time on youtube. There is a problem and the sooner the powers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even when youtube did the big purge i only lost a handful of subscribers from my count, there is something very wrong with the system and i blame most of the problems on this new layout and g+ being linked to our youtube accounts, we never had these kinds of problems before the change over. This whole situation is now getting beyond a joke, at the rate i 'm going i wont have any subscribers this time next month <p> So you guys are basically calling thousands of people from youtube, twitter and facebook LIARS? Are you saying that we are lying to you about our subscribers COMPLAINING to us about being unknowingly UN-UBSCRIBED? REALLY?! Could n't you guys come up with something a little better than " This is not happening. " Whoever wrote this sounds like a 5 year old child who do n't want to get in trouble. Your " YouTube Team " is in some MAJOR denial right now and I do n't understand why you continue to ignore thousands of people throwing this issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are starting to HATE youtube because of you? Nobody even wants to visit YouTube anymore because it 's SO CONFUSING! I created a new account the other day supposedly through youtube, and you guys redirect me to Google +! I did n't even know how to create my YouTube user name. There are no easy step by step instructions! I had to watch a video to find out how! Please stop trying to lie to our faces and face the truth. You guys screwed up and are in way over your head! <p> Do n't bother. They 're not listening. There were a million complaints when the X was gone from the video feed, and they never put it back. Now with this " recommended videos " thing being forced on me, and being unable to X them, my feed is 80% clutter. I ca n't find anything I want. Subscribing became useless. Youtube became too much of a hassle for me to watch videos and I spend 80% less time on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Please make the homepage better looking its ugly especially the left hand side of the homepage <p> Please do something about this invalid clicks thing whats happening to everyone ive been banned for it even when i have adblock on?? smh this is a big issue, i made 60 did nt even get any money? 4 months of hard work on my channel creating videos and promoting them, ive heard of click bombing as well, Plus my friend got banned for invalid activity he had no idea what he had done wrong he stuck to the rules but he still do nt know what he had done wrong he had over 20 million views and worked hard making his funny videos he closed his channel after that and never came back to youtube we were good friends as well talked every day. <p> I am not a very famous youtuber, but I lost around 75 subscribers in one.. now when You only have 500 subscribers, that 's alot to be lost. It says they were deleting accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been on youtube for less than a year, so obviously everyone that had subscribed to me had been active, so I seem to find that to be a false statement... <p> Can you guys explain why when I search for " World of Warcraft " or " kitten ", the top page search results are dominated by music videos from VEVO owned channels that have NOTHING to do with either keyword?? <p> Sympathetic of who is engaging with your channel. Accurate data is key, and as such, we will now be removing accounts from subscriber counts as they are closed. As the accounts are inactive, these changes wo n't affect viewership. <p> Hey, YouTube. Go fuck yourself. I 've read through all the comments and they are complaining about this highlights and everything shit. I 've also noticed that people are complaining that you YouTube bastards are ignoring us all. I have even more complaints for you YouTube idiots. One thing is you spelled Favorites wrong. It is supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrambling the date up. So if the date is 6-8-12, it will look like 8-6-12. And also you could care less how the site looks. You can only delete or mess with 20 videos at once, which makes it impossible. And in order to mess with another 20 I have to shut my whole browser down and come back to the same place I was at. I only get about 2 subs a month and about 10 removed a month. With all the people complaining about this shit, YOU YOUTUBE BASTARDS ARE PURPESLY DOING ALL THIS SHIT!!!!! I BET YOU ASSHOLES ARE SAYING THAT THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE ON THIS SITE!!! BY DOING THIS AND TOURERING OUR USERS WE CAN GET PEOPLE TO QUIT!!! AND WE CAN PREVENT PEOPLE FROM COMING ON THIS SITE BY MAKING IT OT POSSIBLE TO CLOSE YOUTUBE ACCOUNTS!!! I CAN NOT CLOSE ANY OF MY ACCOUNTS, NOT EVEN A GOOGLE ACCOUNT!!!!!!! I AM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UNSUB FROM ALLOT OF USERS THEY WILL JUST BE BACK HERE THE NEXT DAY, THEN I WILL REMOVED 15 MORE, AND THEN THEY WILL BE BACK AGAIN TOO!!!! <p> I hate that the recommended videos are mixed in with the channels I subscribe to on my feed. I want to be able to filter through my subscriptions before I click on recommendations. I subscribe for a reason. I want that to mean something. Please, please, please give us an option to separate the subscriptions and the recommendations! <p> The Highlights shit is still fucking unusably bad Google. Just ditch that system entirely. It keeps defaulting back to Highlights which is not a view I /ever/ want to be using. When I subscribe to something my expectation is to see /every/ video. You are breaking your own site. <p> " We 've also heard some viewers are concerned that they 've been unsubscribed from channels. This is n't happening. " *CLAPS* Gj, you are a complete moron that is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and you are stupid enough to say( No, these problems that you are talking about is not happening, you guys are stupid herpdederppp go click ' Everything ' and it 's right there! TADA!!) This is the most stupidest uploader blog post I 've ever seen. So ignorant of your own issues, and you basically call your customers morons. <p> Please let us delete videos from the ' my subscriptions ' page. I watch over 40 lets players and subscriptions, but with all the videos on my subs page, I ca n't possible watch them all, and there are a bunch every day that do n't appeal to my particular interests, even though I love the channel as a whole. For example, Davetheusher one of my fav LPers is doing Tokyo Jungle as a game, which I have no interest in, but I love his other projects at the moment. Long story cut short, bring back the little x to ' my subscriptions ' so we can sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed by a motorist a few years back and I posted a video on my youtube account of her that was the only footage I had left. <p> YouTube deleted my account with less than a year of inactivity. <p> I could n't log in because I could n't get google to respond to me about my email being suspended. Every month I would send a message begging for someone to respond and I never heard from anyone. I used to be Googles biggest fan and now I 'm just devastated. I 'll never get that footage back. <p> I 'm EXTREMELY frustrated with how google/youtube is handling this. It 's been months and still no fix to this subscriber glitch! Even though i hated the new layout change, i tried to give it a chance, but now this glitch has crossed the line. I 've been using youtube since early 2007, and not once have i been so disappointed with it. I want to see an accurate count
