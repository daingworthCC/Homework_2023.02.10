5257141 <h> One Case at a Time <h> September 6, 2012 <p> On Monday an employee of the Boston Public Works Department washed the vomit and half-dried paint off of the pedestrian bridge over the highway in Allston. Even after the cleaning, miniscule shards of broken glass still lined the grubby edge where the concrete walkway meets the chain-link fence above. The layers of spray-painted messages, mostly about occupying Boston and the godly importance of art vis-a-vis capitalism still cling tightly to the concrete below. This past weekend 's contribution of emesis and takeout containers that greeted me on Monday morning, however, are gone. In four years of traversing this bridge daily it has never been cleaned, and I was sad to see the most recent history removed. <p> The bridge is the exact halfway point between my home and my work. The ramp up to the bridge from the sidewalk on either side is steep. The highway below is broad and busy. Even on cloudy mornings the John Hancock and Prudential buildings jut upward through the mist to the east, and on clear nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the taillights on the highway below. The concrete walkway is just wide enough for two bicycles to pass each other easily. <p> Many of my companions on the bridge are immigrants, men in their twenties and thirties riding old mountain bikes with a plastic bag of belongings hung off the end of the handlebars, young women with toddlers in cheap strollers looking down at the passing cars. They are headed from the buses that pass through Allston to the neighborhood of neat, tightly packed two-family homes to the north. But I prefer the hipsters. Not to disparage the immigrants, who always give me earnest smiles and whose children politely step to the right when I pass on my bike, but I love the hipsters more. I love them, with their tight black jeans and their single-speed bikes. I love their tattoos, and their shitty haircuts, and I love the muffin top that unrepentantly crawls over the top of their tight little jeans. I love the muffin top above the black jeans the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on women. I love the musical instruments slung over their backs, and I love that they are always smoking. I love whichever of them started the thing when they throw the wet paint on the pedestrian bridge at night, because paint is fucking impossible to get off a bike. The one day it got me they had put it right at the northern end of the level part of the bridge, the part I ca n't see until I 'm on it because the ramp up is so steep. The paint was white and the trail I left down the length of the bridge left me cursing until I looked back and saw how pretty it was, the white line, and realized that it would happen a hundred more times that morning and the lines would intertwine. <p> Lately I have been running. In the mornings it is a struggle to awaken abruptly to a sports bra and synthetic shorts but the sun is well below the horizon and the air is clear and cool and the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start of the fun part, the second half when I dodge delivery trucks, orthodox jews and hungover drunks, and then cruise smoothly down the last hill to the tree-lined avenue that brings to me to the hospital where I work. I have a little pouch that straps around my waist that carries my license, work ID, subway pass, credit card, housekey, iPhone, pager and a pair of clean underwear. There is a mix on this iPhone named " wake the fuck up " that is instrumental in me enjoying the first mile. There is more Lady Gaga involved than would normally befit a 34-year-old mother of two. And sometimes when I arrive, 4.15 miles after leaving my home and my sleeping family, I am the strongest and most beautiful woman on earth, and I float through my day with my legs and my cheeks feeling pink and perfect. <p> In the afternoons it is hot, and the second half of the run is the boring half along the highway with the flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way home makes me sad because it is only halfway, so I stop to stretch my hamstrings and stare at the buildings through the haze. There is a pair of dirty underwear in the pouch now, and I am tired. <p> When I get home I land face-down in the frigid kiddie pool in the backyard and I think suddenly that it would be a great idea to run to work in the morning. <h> May 17, 2012 <p> When I clicked on the " View Your Exam Results " link on the American Board of Anesthesiology website, I thought something rashly exuberant would engulf me. I thought that everyone in the lunch room would turn suddenly, throw their reheated pasta and cafeteria sandwiches high aloft with glee and balloons would gush from the cracks between the fluorescent lights on the ceiling as the whole world burst into song. <p> But instead, there was only the word on the computer screen. At the right top corner of the webpage it read " Pass. " <p> I smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finished my case. As I saw my friends I told each one, receiving the heartiest hugs that I have ever been given in the hallways of the operating room. It was over. <p> Board certification in Anesthesiology has four elements. You need to complete an accredited residency program. You need to be neither drug-addicted nor a criminal. You must pass a written examination. And finally, the year after you finish residency and take the written exam, you need to pass an oral board examination. This last step is the most daunting, and I will never have to do it again. <p> After the new year I decided that I would study for half an hour every day. The exam was in April, so I had four months. Half an hour every day, no excuses. There were some excuses, but they were rare. I started in January, when the sky darkened before I picked the kids up from school and we ate dense, spiced chili with hot cornbread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put them to sleep at 7:30 and I would study for half an hour, and many nights the half an hour would bleed on into an hour, and then on into another fifteen minutes, until I went upstairs to sleep. <p> The key to the oral exam is practicing conveying your ideas out loud. So I would send Miles to the basement, where there is a computer and a TV and a comfortable couch, and I would talk to myself. Read a question, answer it out loud, check the answer. The kids always want to pretend -- tigers, Star Wars, mice, dinosaurs, so the pretending was natural. I sat at my kitchen counter for half an hour and pretended that white men in suits were asking me questions and that I was answering each question perfectly. I even laughed. At times I challenged them. <p> On the day of the exam it was raining in Boston and I parked my car in an expensive garage and borrowed a friend 's suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in only one location, and all the oral board examiners and examinees fly there and congregate like flies to fly paper. <p> Each hotel room has two examiners and one examinee. In each room I worked through a case scenario for 25 minutes and was peppered with unrelated questions for another 10 minutes. The first room contained a nice older white man and a nervous young white man. The second room contained a nice older white man and a nervous young brown woman. They asked reasonable questions. I gave reasonable answers. <p> After it was over I drove home and ate a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I drove to my favorite place and went for a six-mile trail run in a light rain. I picked the kids up just as school was getting out. It was a good day. <p> On my way home after the good news I felt different. My mind wandered to the nights I have been on call, the only anesthesiologist in the cavernous hospital, and the times when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an attending my patient, who had had a massive facial trauma, developed a leak in her breathing tube at 2:00 in the morning. " Leave the tube in " the surgeons suggested, " we 'll change it later in the ICU if we need to. " But because the person who would change the endotracheal tube two hours later in the ICU was me, I elected to change it early and prophylactically in the controlled setting of the operating room with the surgeon standing by with a knife in his hand. I told each person exactly what to do and I had three backup plans. It was a scene from one of my nightmares, but I did the right thing. It went smoothly. <p> The oral boards questions are always imperfect scenarios, where any answer would be at least partially wrong. The reason for failure is often stage fright, but the purpose of the exam is to have a window into how you behave in the operating room. It is the last step toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would act reasonably when the answer is not immediately evident. They will pass you if they believe that you will be a good, safe anesthesiologist. <p> So although I know a few of them and I know that they are fully human, I imagine these oral board examiners as an imposing and heavy-cloaked crew. I see them as my five-year-old would want them to be. It is a dark and stormy night and the Keepers of the Golden Chalice are gathered around the cauldron. They have sipped from its clouded opalescent waters and they have decided who will be invited to dance at midnight under the next full moon, wearing nothing but the white flowers of the night-blooming jasmine in their hair. They have engraved their list on a heavy scroll, and my name is on it. <h> January 3, 2012 <p> The anesthesia scheduling office accidentally placed me in an operating room tomorrow with a patient who is a Jehovah 's Witness. It was a paperwork slip-up ; I am new and someone forgot to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are three options for anesthesiologists at my hospital : You will provide anesthesia for Jehovah 's Witnesses <p> For all operations <p> Only for operations that are not expected to involve great blood loss <p> Never <p> Of course, all anesthesiologists agree to care for Jehovah 's Witnesses who have a life-threatening emergency if we are the only one available. <p> I had chosen number three : never. I called the scheduling office and they apologized and switched me to a different operating room. <p> My lack of faith in any nameable higher being is so firm that I can not reconcile it with what Jehovah 's Witnesses would ask me to do. Their practice comes, of course, from the bible. According to watchtower.org, the official website of the Jehovah 's Witnesses, the belief that " Taking blood into body through mouth or veins violates God 's laws " comes from three biblical passages : Gen. 9:3, 4 ; Lev. 17:14 ; Acts 15:28, 29. They read as follows, in order as referenced : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food for you. As in the case of green vegetation, I do give it all to you. Only flesh with its soul -- its blood -- you must not eat. " <p> " For the soul of every sort of flesh is its blood by the soul in it. Consequently I said to the sons of Israel : You must not eat the blood of any sort of flesh, because the soul of every sort of flesh is its blood. Anyone eating it will be cut off. " <p> " For the holy spirit and we ourselves have favored adding no further burden to you, except these necessary things, to keep abstaining from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication. If you carefully keep yourselves from these things, you will prosper. Good health to you! " <p> A survey of the " beliefs " section of watchtower.org reveals that Jehovah 's Witnesses also believe the following( all verbatim) : <p> Christ died on a stake, not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the battle at Har-Magedon <p> Human death is due to Adam 's sin <p> Only a little flock of 144,000 go to heaven and rule with Christ <p> Satan is invisible ruler of world <p> Jehovah 's Witnesses ' individual approach to blood products varies somewhat, but the basic premise is simple : they will not receive blood products, even if this refusal will lead to their death. They must sign a special consent form and we go over each blood product individually to determine if they will accept it. <p> Some refuse blood, plasma and platelets but will accept heat-treated human protein. Some will donate blood for themselves in advance whereas others believe that once it leaves the body it can not return. Some accept salvaged blood from intraoperative suction devices, and others allow blood to be withdrawn from a vein and re-transfused hours later, as long as the circuit containing the blood was never disconnected from their body. <p> But for most it is simple. No blood products, even if it means death. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Witnesses because I disagree with their beliefs would not quite capture it. We are each entitled to our own beliefs, religious and otherwise. What I am not capable of doing is letting a human being under my medical care die from a completely preventable cause. <p> I am morally incapable of letting someone bleed to death. In my operating room, when I am delivering anesthesia, I am responsible completely for that person 's life. This responsibility weighs heavily on me until each patient is safely out of the operating room. I welcome the weight. I care for each person deeply. <p> I have no religious beliefs. I was raised without religion and am happy for it. I make my own decisions based on the moral and ethical boundaries of my society, self and family. Because I have no religious framework of my own, I am thoroughly incapable of understanding or accepting a Jehovah 's Witness 's stance. To me it seems ridiculous, based on nothing. I will not participate in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and I am sure that I will never let a person bleed to death if I can prevent it. So the choice is simple : number three. I do not take care of them. If one comes in bleeding to death in the middle of the night and I am the only anesthesiologist in the hospital, I am stuck. I will do it their way because the alternative is morally inferior. I hope that never happens. <p> " But everyone always said you were a great resident Felicity, you 're going to be a great attending too. I 'm sure everything will be fine tomorrow. " <p> " But that 's the problem. I 'm not sure everything will be fine tomorrow. I could easily kill someone tomorrow. Every day I could easily kill someone. I thought I loved this before -- as a resident I loved the hard cases, the sick patients, but now it 's... it 's just petrifying. " <p> I have not killed anyone. I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had any egregious errors or unexpected complications. I have a strong safety net of other anesthesiologists if I need it. But I am in a continuous state of pure fear. <p> I thought I loved this, the stress of the unknown, the pure challenge of the most complex physiology. I had no idea how different it would be once the ultimate responsibility rested with me. <p> There is always the one moment. I connect a patient, a live human whose family I have met and handed a box of tissues to, to the various monitors and give him oxygen to breathe. I cycle the blood pressure cuff and double-check my suction and move all of the airway equipment and all of the drugs into perfect position so that I can reach everything without more than rotating my ankle. I watch the expired oxygen concentration to make sure that the nitrogen in my patient 's lungs has been completely replaced by oxygen. And then, there comes this moment when I turn the stopcock and push the syringe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tubing completely. When I am done I turn the stopcock again and flush it in completely with saline. <p> Now it is done. I have taken away the will to breathe. There is no going back now. I must breathe for this patient. It is usually quite easy but if I can not mask ventilate him and I can not intubate him then he can die. I have seen that only one time in three years but for now, in these days when I am just beginning that is all I can think of. Every time I turn the stopcock and say " Okay, you 'll feel a little burning in your arm but that 's just the medicine that puts you off to sleep. I 'll take good care of you and you 'll see your family soon, " I am petrified. <h> September 30, 2011 <p> Today was a perfect early fall day, the kind when you leave the house in jeans and a fleece jacket and end up sweating through your T-shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school, red in the face with my handed-down pale freckled complexion. Eli trailed behind him, hiding and seeking the Kindergarten girls along with his big brother. <p> I struck up a conversation with the mother of Keenan 's playmate. Her daughter was a beautiful, leggy 5-year-old girl with deep dark eyes. In the small talk I mentioned that I am at home this week, but next week Keenan will be back in the before-school program because my husband and I both go to work early. <p> " What do you do? " <p> " I 'm, well, " I stumbled. " I actually just finished my residency last week, so that 's why I 'm on vacation right now, but next week I start work again, so I 'm actually... I 'm an anesthesiologist. " <p> Awful. Bad job, Felicity. I need to work on smoothing that out. This will not be the last after-school mom small talk conversation I find myself in when I have to answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " I 'm a doctor, " but then people inevitably ask what kind of doctor and so really this only mystifies the profession more severely and makes it sound as if you were trying to make it sound intimidating, when it already sounds intimidating. <p> I finished residency last week, at 4:29 PM on a Wednesday. I just walked out of the operating room, changed out of my scrubs, picked the kids up from school and made dinner. <p> Although publicly awkward, I want to sing a victory song. After eight years of medical training I am done. It started in Baltimore, on a steaming day in late summer. None of us realized that the T-shirts we wore that first day would be emblazoned on an I.D. badge attached to our little white coats for four years. <p> I got hit by a car on my road bike in the fall of my third year of medical school, and I spent two months after that cordoned on the couch, left leg tightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put them on( and reading medical physiology of course). Keenan was born a year to the day after the accident. Eli was born nearly three years later. I worked a full day, had dinner on the back deck, and went back to the hospital to have a baby before bedtime. When my in-laws brought Keenan to the hospital to visit the next morning he hit the big red emergency button on the wall -- because it was red, and large. He saw Eli 's umbilical cord and was impressed that his baby brother had, in his estimation, two penises. The baby sweaters are in a storage box in the basement now, waiting for someone to have a baby so I can pass them along. Eli is two years old. Sometimes now they giggle with an evil sound and run away, together, laughing. <p> The victory song goes like this. I am thirty-three years old. I am an anesthesiologist. If the unthinkable happens and you come to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double-check the drugs before I give them to you. I will track your blood pressure closely and slow your speeding heart down. I will treat your pain skillfully. When you awaken I will look into your eyes and I will calm you. I have wanted this for so long, and I have two beautiful children and a husband who have endured every single one of the two hundred nights I have slept in the hospital over the last four years, and I am going to make it all worth it. I am going to do a perfect job. <h> September 3, 2011 <p> He taunted me encephalopathically from his hospital bed. He called me closer. <p> " Can I get some of those drugs now? " <p> " No, I ca n't give you the sedation until we are in the endoscopy room, " I answered. <p> " Oh. " His bearded face and yellow eyes were briefly sad, until the memory of our conversation faded into the hepatitic haze. <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? " <p> " Nope, I 'm not giving you any drugs until I hook you up to the monitors, and that does n't happen until I take you into the endoscopy room. " I tired of my own answers, rearranging words to appease my own desire for a freshly structured sentence. He did not tire. <p> " So, are you going to start the drugs now? " He asked, again for the first time. <p> I tried to cancel it, the whole thing, but his daughters did not realize that he was dying. They knew that he kept bleeding and that the bleeding was the start of the whole thing and that the doctors might be able to stop the bleeding, so they agreed to the endoscopy. It is hard to tell what dying looks like if you have never seen it so close before. <p> He never stopped drinking, but he starting vomiting up blood one day and went to the emergency room. He was almost dead then but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells, plasma and platelets as his body ejected it, again and again. His liver was ruined, he was bleeding to death and he was still drunk. The doctors put a breathing tube in and did an endoscopy, sliding a long thick tube into his esophagus and tying off the bleeders with thin rubber bands. <p> It worked. The bleeding stopped. He withdrew from the alcohol violently and slowly. The breathing tube came out. But his kidneys stopped working completely and the doctors put a dialysis catheter into a thick vein in his neck so a machine could do the work meant for kidneys. His blood stopped clotting and the transfusions poured in. His liver no longer did anything really, just took up space in the hardened right upper quadrant of his distended abdomen. It did n't make the clotting factors that prevent blood from pouring out endlessly from every scratch. It did n't filter out the toxins that were poisoning his brain. It was thick and hard and would n't let blood pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distended veins that lined his esophagus, and every so often they would burst, and the blood would pour out. <p> I had never seen numbers this bad. <p> " Damn! " I muttered to myself as I looked over his chart in the morning. <p> " Damn. " <p> " He is sick. " <p> I armored myself against the Gastroenterologist who would be doing the procedure. I calculated his MELD score, the number for grading the severity of liver dysfunction that assigns a slot on the liver transplant list. <p> My patient would not be getting a liver transplant. You have to convincingly and permanently stop drinking before anyone will give you a new liver, but the MELD score is based on several predictive laboratory values and can be plugged into a number of other scientifically verified calculators for estimating outcomes. I thought the result would help convince everyone to steer entirely clear of this man. <p> His 90-day mortality was 97%. So it was nearly sure that he would be dead in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, meaning that if I gave him anesthesia for a procedure, there was a 71% chance that he would be dead in a week. His 30-day postoperative mortality was 98% : he was virtually guaranteed to be dead in a month if we did something to him. <p> The bottom line was that he was dying, and doing a procedure, despite its benefits, brought with it added risks. He would die soon with or without it. It could slow down the bleeding, but it would require an anesthetic that could easily tip him over the edge and it was impossible to know which force would prevail. I did not want an anesthetic provided by me to be the most proximate cause of his inevitable death. <p> My heavily armored argument failed. The Gastroenterologist understood me but was defenseless against the patient 's daughters, who wanted " everything done. " <p> I retreated back to the procedure room and talked with the endoscopy nurse as we set up for another case. <p> " It 's funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cases, but there 's really only two reasons. If he was a Jehovah 's witness I could refuse to do the anesthesia for the case and nobody would bat an eyelash. If it was an abortion I could refuse to participate. But him, he 's just dying and I think we should just leave him alone, and everyone looks at me cross-eyed when I say we should cancel it. I would n't even think of refusing to personally do the case. " <p> But another bad thing happened in the hospital then and I was swept away to where I was needed and never saw him again. If this were a book I would have the right ending, I would know how and when he died and I would teach a lesson to you. I would paint you a picture of the thick droplets of blood slowly passing inward as the thin yellowed blood oozed out. I would tell you what the faces of his daughters looked like when they said to me, " We just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he was dying. " But this is a blog, so the story does not end, but continues on as we continue on, imperfectly. <h> August 8, 2011 <p> When I stepped out of the revolving door in the hospital lobby this morning the air was cool and moist. There were pockmarks on the sidewalk from where raindrops had been and a man and a woman were smoking. They sat on the curb and through the open back of his hospital gown a tatoo snaked down his left side. Her hospital I.D. bracelet hung from the narrow part of her left arm and she smoked with her right. I walked slowly. <p> The air was only cool in the way that the morning is cool. It was opressively wet but it had not yet started to warm. I walked slowly and undeliberately toward the bicycle rack on the ground floor of the parking garage. Twenty-four hours had passed since I locked my bike to the rack and walked into this building. There had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was time for me to go home. <p> A policeman directed traffic agressively through the intersection caddycorner to the hospital 's main entrance. I waited until he signaled me to cross. A cluster of ambulances was blocking the road adjacent to the sidewalk that leads to the parking garage. <p> Another policeman signaled me to walk alongside the ambulances in the road, not on the sidewalk. As I rounded the corner I saw the flash of a steel laryngoscope blade entering a fat man 's mouth. The man was having a cardiac arrest on the sidewalk and he was being intubated by an EMT. His body recoiled with each chest compression. The man with the laryngoscope blade got the breathing tube in on the first try. I walked slowly. I was wearing a T-shirt and gym shorts and sandals and carried my bike helmet in my left hand. I hoped that they could get the fat man up off the sidewalk. There is some sort of construction and there are barricades along the sidewalk, but
