5085841 <p> The drought has sapped the production of corn, soybeans and other crops, afflicting poultry and livestock in turn. The most recent federal assessment in August is that parts of at least 33 states, mostly in the West and the Midwest, are experiencing drought conditions that are severe or worse. It is affecting 87 percent of the land dedicated to growing corn, 63 percent of the land for hay and 72 percent of the land used for cattle. <p> The impact of the drought has extended beyond farming. In Missouri, the torrid conditions have sparked forest fires that resemble the types of wildfires seen in the West. Already, more than 116 wildfires have burned in Missouri 's Mark Twain National Forest, a record-setting pace. Conditions have been so dry that there was a report of hay in a barn combusting on its own. <p> Meanwhile, water levels are falling in town reservoirs as well as major waterways like the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers. Barge and towboat operators have been reducing the size of their loads because of the low water. This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from crops to gravel, have had to take more trips, increasing transportation costs that could be passed on to consumers. <p> The hot, dry weather is also harming parts of the nation 's infrastructure. Highways in Texas, nuclear power plants in Illinois, runways and subway rails in Washington and the concrete, steel and sophisticated engineering that undergird the nation 's infrastructure are being taxed to worrisome degrees by heat, drought and vicious storms. <p> What is particularly striking about the dry spell is its breadth. Fifty-five percent of the continental United States -- from California to Arkansas, Texas to North Dakota -- is experiencing moderate to extreme drought, according to the government, the largest such area since December 1956. <p> The unsettling news has come at a time of growing uncertainty for the country 's economy. With evidence mounting of a slowdown in the economic recovery, this new blow from the weather was particularly ill-timed. <p> With Low Corn Yield, Food Prices May Rise <p> The scorching heat and the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices up, spooking consumers and leading to worries about global food costs. <p> On July 25, the United States government said it expected the record-breaking weather to drive up the price for groceries in 2013, including milk, beef, chicken and pork. The drought has affected 88 percent of the corn crop, a staple of processed foods and animal feed as well as the nation 's leading farm export <p> The government 's forecast, based on a consumer price index for food, estimated that prices would rise 4 to 5 percent for beef in 2013 with slightly lower increases for pork, eggs and dairy products. <p> The corn yield is expected to be 123.4 bushels an acre, the lowest in 17 years, and corn prices are projected to reach a record $7.50 to $8.90 a bushel, the report said. An earlier report projected about 146 bushels an acre. <p> The report said that soybeans were expected to be 36.1 bushels an acre -- 4.4 bushels an acre below the July government estimate and 5.4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to be $15 to $17 a bushel, the government said. <p> The report 's data on meats was mixed. Beef and poultry production are expected to increase in 2012 as livestock producers cull or sell their herds because of higher feed cost. Eggs, milk and pork production are expected to decline because of hot weather and feed prices. <p> For now, analysts said they expected the broader economic impact of rising food prices to be modest. Americans spend just 13 percent of their household budgets on food. The falling price of gasoline -- fuel and transportation costs being a major component of prices at restaurants and grocery stores -- will help temper any price increases. <p> Analysts said there might be little effect on economic growth or overall inflation, which has been running around 2 percent a year. <p> But economists said consumers -- particularly the poor and unemployed -- would still feel the effects. <p> Economists fear a far greater impact outside of the United States because America is a major exporter of a broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less supply and higher prices abroad. <p> Drying Up the Mighty Mississippi River <p> Despite being fed by water flowing in from more than 40 percent of the United States, the Mississippi river is feeling the ruinous drought affecting so much of the Midwest. Some stretches are nearing the record low-water levels experienced in 1988, when river traffic was suspended in several spots. <p> That is unlikely in 2012, because of careful engineering work to keep the largest inland marine system in the world passable. The Army Corps of Engineers has more than a dozen dredging vessels working the Mississippi. <p> Still, the channel is shallower, by a lot. Tow operators are dealing with this fact by hauling fewer barges, loading them lighter and running them more slowly, raising their costs. Since May, about 60 vessels have run aground in the lower Mississippi. <p> The corps has engineered other ways " to help the river keep itself open, " said James T. Pogue, a spokesman for the corps in Memphis. They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river and " sort of act like nozzles to speed up the flow of the river " to scour the bed, he said. <p> Such river training structures help to reduce the amount of dredging necessary by making the river do much of the work. The result, said Mr. Pogue, is that even if water reaches the levels that it did before, " we 'll still be in better shape than we were in ' 88. " <p> But if the weather does not improve, the situation could get much worse, said David R. Busse, the chief of the engineering and construction division for the St. Louis district of the corps. If the rains do not come, the river will continue to drop. There will be a precipitous fall of about two feet at St. Louis toward the end of 2012, when the reservoirs up the Missouri River, as scheduled every year, stop releasing water into the Mississippi. <p> " Right now we have a problem, but we 're managing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they turn it off? " <p> Devastating to Midwestern Agriculture <p> After favorable spring weather in 2012, United States corn production had been projected to hit a record high, approaching nearly 15 billion bushels, as farmers had planted the most acreage since the late 1930s to capture profits from what were already the highest corn prices ever. <p> Then the drought set in, projections of a bumper crop evaporated and prices began to climb. <p> As of mid-July, more than half of the corn in seven states was in poor or very poor condition, according to the Department of Agriculture. In Kentucky, Missouri and Indiana, that figure was above 70 percent. Overall, only 31 percent of the nation 's corn is in good to excellent condition, compared with 66 percent at the same time in 2011. Already some farmers have been watching their cash crops burn to the point of no return. Others have been cutting their corn early to use for feed, a much less profitable venture. <p> The withering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, putting stress on cattle farmers. A record 54 percent of pasture and rangeland -- where cattle feed or where hay is harvested for feeding -- was in poor or very poor condition, according to the Department of Agriculture. Many farmers have been forced to sell their animals. <p> Still, the 2012 drought is not expected to be as rough on Midwestern agriculture as the one in 1988. Corn yields were 22 percent under trend that year, and this year the Department of Agriculture is projecting yields 11 percent under trend. <p> Many also believe that farmers are better situated in 2012 to handle the impact of a drought than they were two decades ago. More than 80 percent of corn and soybeans are estimated to be insured. <p> They have been dropping dead in the Navajo reservation in the Southwest, where neighbors are battling neighbors and livestock for water, an inherently scant resource on tribal land. They have been found stumbling through state parks in Missouri, in backyards and along country roads in Illinois, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong. <p> Some are taken to rescue farms or foster homes -- lifelines that are also buckling under the pressure of the drought, which has pushed the price of grain and hay needed to feed the animals beyond the reach of many families already struggling in the tight economy. <p> While precise figures are hard to come by, rough estimates from the Unwanted Horse Coalition, an alliance of equine organizations based in Washington, puts the number of unwanted horses -- those given up on by their owners for whatever reasons -- at 170,000 to 180,000 nationwide, said Ericka Caslin, the group 's director. <p> Many more could be out there, though. The Navajos, for instance, have no tally on the number of feral horses on their land ; a $2 million effort to count and round them up was vetoed by the tribe 's president because of the cost. <p> The measure passed 223 to 197, a tight margin for a bill that has an impact on so many states. But Democratic leaders in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill, said they were not inclined to rush through the House measure, blaming the Republican leaders in the House for failing to consider the broader legislation in time. <p> The impact of the weather on the nation 's farmers has put new pressure on Congress to move ahead on the farm bill. But House Republican leaders have been reluctant to act because of divisions within the party 's rank-and-file about the cost of the nearly $1 trillion bill. The legislation includes several federal agriculture programs that farmers have come to expect, though it does not include any specific drought assistance. Several important disaster relief programs expired at the end of 2011, leaving farmers and ranchers who have lost cattle or grazing land with few options without Congressional action. <p> Effects on the Nation 's Infrastructure <p> The extreme weather has also left parts of the nation 's grid buckling. In July, a US Airways regional jet became stuck in asphalt that had softened in 100-degree temperatures, and a subway train derailed after the heat stretched the track so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stretch that was supposed to be straight. <p> In East Texas, heat and drought have had a startling effect on the clay-rich soils under highways, which " just shrink like crazy, " leading to " horrendous cracking, " said Tom Scullion, senior research engineer with the Texas Transportation Institute at Texas A &M; University. In Northeastern and Midwestern states, he said, unusually high heat is causing highway sections to expand beyond their design limits, press against each other and " pop up, " creating jarring and even hazardous speed bumps. <p> In the Chicago area, a twin-unit nuclear plant had to get special permission to keep operating in July because the pond it uses for cooling water rose to 102 degrees ; its license to operate allows it to go only to 100. According to the Midwest Independent System Operator, the grid operator for the region, a different power plant had had to shut because the body of water from which it draws its cooling water had dropped so low that the intake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back generation because cooling water was too warm. <p> The frequency of extreme weather is up over the past few years, and people who deal with infrastructure expect that to continue. Leading climate models suggest that weather-sensitive parts of the infrastructure will be seeing many more extreme episodes, along with shifts in weather patterns and rising maximum( and minimum) temperatures. <p> Ethanol Quota Is Challenged <p> As the drought has ravaged corn producers and industrial consumers alike, three big intertwined but rival agribusinesses -- corn farmers, meat and poultry producers, and biofuel refineries -- are in a political fight to protect their interests. At issue is whether to suspend a five-year-old federal mandate requiring more ethanol in gasoline each year, a policy that has diverted almost half of the domestic corn supply from animal feedlots to ethanol refineries, driven up corn prices and plantings and created a desperate competition for corn as the drought has gripped the nation 's farm belt. <p> Meat producers are demanding that the Obama administration waive the ethanol quota to ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of the quota would undermine the ethanol industry and do little for corn farmers but drive down the price of their stunted harvest. <p> Corn growers, caught in a political tug of war between their biggest customers, are asking the government to move cautiously, if at all.( Many ethanol refineries are owned by corn farmers.) The corn farmers said a waiver should be allowed only if careful study showed a severe economic impact. <p> Drought slashed U.S. corn production to the lowest level in six years and soybeans to the lowest in nine years, the government forecast, but the corn crop is larger than expected. The soybean crop forecast, however, is smaller than expected. <h> Multimedia <p> A withering drought in India, a new editor for Cosmopolitan, an ambitious bond-buying program from the European Central Bank and a lineup of
