Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc. <p> I started to ski five years ago at the age of 46 when my wife, an avid accomplished skier, insisted. After numerous group and private lessons, I was probably a 5 on the standard 10 scale. It was discouraging. Then, I discovered Lito 's books, tapes and lessons. Now, I 'm a 9 on a 10 scale able to easily ski on all but difficult black diamond bumps. Everything else is a breeze and fun. Better skiing is not harder, it 's just different. Lito 's book takes you step by step, stage by stage, one phase at a time. It 's so simple it 's remarkable that no other book has come close. For example, since skiing generally requires all your weight on one foot at a time, which foot is it? Most people, even accomplished skiers, answer either the uphill or downhill ski. This answer is both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outside ski which could be uphill at one point and downhill at another point. Next, he explains how and why shifting weight to the other ski must be completed early and dynamically. This is actually simple somewhat like a dance step. The book continues on with secret after secret until the cumulative result is advanced skiing. After five or six days following his advice, it really came together. I 'll never forget that time down a black diamond slope using his techniques naturally and easily. At the bottom, I looked back at the formerly imposing slope and realized that it had been a breeze. Looking to the ski, I said thank you God and Lito. Since then, fear and trepidation( except for those black diamond bumps) have forever been excised from my skiing. If you 're tired of stopping at the top of a tough slope trying to build up your courage, you 've apparently never read Lito 's book, seen his tapes and/or implemented his advice. After reading and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy opportunity to enjoy this incredible sport. Once again, thank you Lito. <p> Yeah, I know -- skiing books do n't teach you to ski. But this book, a slope, and a week WILL teach an intermediate skier to ski like an expert. <p> His main point is crucial : expert skiing is a different set of skills. Many of us( me especially) reach intermediate level quickly, but we stay there forever. Refining those skills wo n't make an expert skier. <p> Lito Tejada-Flores breaks the skills of skiing down into simple, straightforward technical steps. He teaches you to ski with your feet, not your head. <p> Skiing only one week a year, I went from NASTAR bronze to NASTAR gold. My wife and I own over two dozen ski books. This one alone did more for us than all the rest. We will both read it again before and during this year 's ski trip. It 's a winner. <p> Go to DVD &; VIDEO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has made three videotapes which are as superb as the book. I talked a good deal there in a customer review( for Tape #3) to the effect that the first two tapes are indispensable. <p> We all learn differently but for me, book and tapes are necessary companions. Bear in mind that the tapes are 29 bucks, full length, and you wind up watching them over and over. An hour of ski instruction on the slope is about 75 dollars--and let 's be honest, when was
