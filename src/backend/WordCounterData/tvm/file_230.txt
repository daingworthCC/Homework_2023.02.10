Look, we do n't normally do this. But I think I 'm gon na need some proof that you 're actually getting married. What? Why? Because you 've been coming in here and trying on wedding dresses every Saturday... for over a year now. Yeah. That 's ' cause it takes a really long time to plan a wedding. Do n't get up all over my balls, Lucy. Just go get the dresses. When is the wedding? Soon. Where? A church. Which one? The nearby one. The nearby one? Right down the street. Spring Which street? What 's your fiance 's name? Sam. What does he do? S-S-Salt. Salt? Sea... salt. Sea salt. He 's a salt seaman. He - He dives in to the ocean for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up. And then we eat it. So - Okay, I 'm getting the manager. Well, do n't get the- [Sighs] Damn it. - [Dee] Reynolds? - Yeah. Brad Fisher. From high school. Brad Fisher. No way. Yeah. You look amazing. Your acne cleared up really well. I kinda grew into myself. Yes, you did. Yes, you did. Why did I ever break up with you, you beefcake? It was because of the acne. Was it because of the acne? Yeah. Yeah. Uh, when it got real bad, you dumped me and you said it was ' cause I was gon na grow up to look like Edward James Olmos. Well, I do n't really remember saying exactly that. It's- it 's fine. We were kids. We were kids. We were kids! Yeah. We 're not kids any more. No. Great. Wow. So you're- you 're getting married. Wow. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not. This is because I was. But that-that did n't work out. Why are you asking? Are you single? What 's your situation? Um, I 'm engaged. But we 're having a whole nontraditional kinda small thing. So you should meet her. Babe. Well, nah... - [Woman] Yeah? - Come here for a second. I want you to meet a friend of mine. What do you think of this one, Brad? It 's beautiful, yeah. Oh, my God. [Buzzing] [Mac] Okay. All right. Well, do n't poke at it. Do n't just poke... Just get it safely into the box. Dude, you 're gon na agitate the bees. Well, I 'm fine with the bees. It 's the honey I do n't want to agitate. Is that your endgame here? Honey? Yeah. I figure if we keep the hive in the basement, we 'll always have honey. [Buzzing] We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whoa! What? What? I think I just saw a wasp. I think that was a wasp. You see that? Looked like a wasp. Did n't look like a bee. Is this a wasp nest? This is a wasp nest. I 'm out! I 'm out! All right. Yeah, yeah. I do n't want to tangle with a bunch of wasps. Hey! do wasps make honey? [Buzzing] No. Wasps do not make honey. All right. Well, I 'm gon na check it out anyway. There could be something delicious in here that wasps do make, and I want that. [Mac], Dennis, can I talk to you in the office, please? Why ca n't we just talk right here? Yeah? Because it 's private. Ah, that sounds like a whole thing. I 'm not into it. - Mmm. - [Screaming] Shit! I just got stung! That was a hornet! This is a hornets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do n't we step in the back office... while Charlie deals with this whole hornet/wasp situation? Yeah. Oh. Oh, I 'm a bad boy? I 'm a bad boy? Put some vegetable oil on it. That 'll make you feel better. Okay. Bye, sexy. Ohh. Who was that? That 's my booty call. We 're into some really weird food fetish stuff. Gross. Okay, you guys, listen up. We got a serious problem. The waitress is getting married. Oh, yeah. I heard about that. Artemis told me. - Since when do you talk to Artemis? - She 's my booty call. Weird. We 'll get into that later. Right now, we got ta deal with this waitress situation. [Dee], why do you give a shit that the waitress is getting married? She 's been nothing but trouble for us. That 's a good point. She does n't seem to get our sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. She does n't. Hilarious! Guys! I can not believe you 're not thinking about Charlie right now. This is gon na crush him. What? You do n't give a shit about Charlie. All you care about is the fact the waitress is getting married before you. Right? That or she 's afraid that Charlie might blow his brains out. And then she 'd have to do all the Charlie work. Uh, that 's what it is. Yeah. Okay, fine. A : I do not want to do Charlie 's work once he kills himself. B : How could the waitress get married before me? I 'm way hotter than she is. And C : Get this. The guy she 's marrying used to be my boyfriend. You know what I just realized? I do n't care about anything she 's saying. Not a bit. What I do care about is the fact that... Charlie might go postal if he finds out about this and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're probably the ones at real risk here, huh? Yeah. Okay. Well, maybe we should find something to distract him... until the whole wedding thing blows over. Mm-hmm. - Get him his own booty call. - Ohh! Or at least another chick to stalk. Hey! Great. In the meantime, I 'll try and sabotage the wedding... by luring Brad away from her. Ahh. [Dee], save yourself the embarrassment. Yeah, yeah. Let's- Watch out for the hornets. Yeah. Do n't push me. [Knocking] [Door_Opens] Hey-oh! Hey, what's- Ahh! What are you doing there, buddy? I 'm trying to smoke these hornets to death so I can get their honey. They keep flying up the tube, stinging me on my face. I think I just swallowed one. As I tried to explain before, you can not get honey from a hornets nest. I just do n't think there 's any science to support that, buddy. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. No. No. Trust me, pal. It 's a fact. It 's not even science. Why are you bothering... getting into it with him? I do n't know. I just feel like... Charlie, we 're gon na get you back on the dating scene, bro. What do you think about that? Yeah. That 's actually why we 're here. I do n't see why. I got the waitress, guys. Yeah. Yeah, right. Sure, right. Uh, yeah, totally. We thought maybe you could meet somebody new. Yeah. Someone you like even more than the waitress. I do n't see how that 's possible. But I tell you what, let me pop a quick " H " on this box. This way we all know it 's filled with the hornets. Okay? Okay, yeah. Do what you got ta do. These things sting like a bitch, man. First thing we got ta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... Ahh. So, do you have the makeup? - Yeah. - Oh, no makeup! Come on. Well, those hornet stings are pretty bad, buddy.

Let 's pretend you 're not who you are and just try to attract a woman. I tell you what. What if I wore a checkered hat and I smoked a pipe? That 'd work. Why would you want a checkered hat and a pipe? You know, for the Sherlock Holmes look. Why would you want to look like Sherlock Holmes? - Who are you trying to attract exactly? - Intelligent women. Okay. I 'm just gon na take the photo right now without the makeup... - and see if he likes it. Ready? - Yeah. - Ooh, that felt good. Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexy. We 'll Photoshop it.

We like to put ' em in Artemis 's hair and they rain down on me when we bang. I feel like a Cobb salad. It 's amazing. Okay. I have no idea why anyone would want to feel like a Cobb salad. But whatever, that 's good. Bring that up when Brad 's here. All right, Mrs. [Mac], make sure that you talk... about how the waitress looks exactly like you when you were young, right? You remember that? There 's a whole carton of cigarettes in it for you. [Coughing] Uh, Mrs. Kelly, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wants to steal the love of your son 's life away. Nobody hurts my Charlie!
