5246441 Previously on " The Mist "... This way. Are you real? Put down the gun. No! Team want to celebrate tonight. Do you want to come? Alex is not old enough for a party. I 'm gon na get you guys a drink. Okay. Adrian saw what happened. He says it was Jay. We need to get inside. We got to go! Adrian. Wait in the car. What are you gon na do? Find my wife and daughter. We 're safe. It 's coming! It 's coming! What do you see? Ca n't see anything. I tried warning them there was something out there. They would n't listen. What was it? My dog ran to the mist, and, something killed it. You think it could be some kind of animal? Does n't explain this guy. Connor 's gone. MMaybe it 's, chemical warfare, like aan acid cloud? Well, you 're the soldier. Should n't you know? What do we do? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ta get to them. Look, there 'll be food there, supplies. I thought you said you wanted to help. Yeah, but what about the whole cockroach outofmouth incident. I 'm not trying to force anyone to do anything. I 'm coming. Me, too. Well, I 'm not staying here alone, so... There 's a police car out front. Let 's find the keys and get the hell out of here. Where 's Connor? He 's gone. That asshole left us here. Mrs. Raven. whose blood is this? - Yes? - Father, Police Chief Heisel is here. He looks... Is he here because of my husband? What do you mean? There was a man in the mist. He came out of nowhere. He shot Benedict, and then he shot himself. You ca n't see a thing outside, man. Right up against the front door. When is the police coming? They will. Do n't worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure. There 's a lady right here that knows. Thank you. Mrs. Copeland? I 'm Gus Bradley, the mall manager. Kyle said you saw what happened? Mrs. Carmody went outside. We heard her scream. She came running back to the window. Her jaw was missing, and then something... something dragged her back. What was it? I do n't know. What about her son? He 's still out there. Come with me. Is it weird I kind of wish that I had seen it? Not weird, disturbing, profoundly. Should we go out and look for her son? No one 's going anywhere, Raj, not until we know it 's safe. Could it have been a bear? I saw her. It was no bear. What are we gon na do if it gets inside? We make sure it does n't. Okay, everybody, listen up! Until we get in contact with law enforcement, we stay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're gon na lock the doors, so whatever is out there wo n't be getting in here. I 'm gon na need some help. Let 's hurry. I 've got two keys here. We 'll take the lower level. Okay. - I can help. - Yeah. Let 's go with her. Alex. I just ca n't be here right now. Okay. Mrs. Raven 's in back. She said someone shot her husband and then killed himself. Just now? Jesus. Should n't you go out there? She said he killed himself? All right. Then we sit tight until we know what 's going on. I hoped you knew what it was out there. No idea, but in case it 's toxic smoke or something like that, we stay. It 's better to be safe. Nat, I 'm so sorry. It 's okay. All right. Hey, follow me. Follow me. Look, sit down. Sit down. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keys. The man found a set. I 'm scared, okay, like everybody else. I thought... these might help take the edge off. Please do n't tell him. He 's gon na leave me here. I 'm always the one being left behind. You an addict? Who got us out of that cell? You think a junkie could pull that off? I want the truth. The truth is that... I want to feel better than I do, and you can go... yourself if you do n't understand. If this is gon na be a problem out there... It wo n't be. It wo n't be if you help me. I need you to help me. He does n't have to know. But the pills stay. You think it 's safe to get close to the doors? It 'll be fine. It 's fine. We 're fine. Thank you for coming with me. - I 'm Kimmi. - Eve. Maybe she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the hallways is filled with mist, and there 's another body in it. Jesus. What the hell is going on? Where was it? Which hallway? This one. That 's the administration wing. Do we just sit and wait? Should n't the police be here already? There might be another option. After 9/11, Homeland Security issued radios to all major public outlets. We got one of those. It 's in the security office. What 's wrong? The security office is in the admin wing, right where you found that body. Jesus. It 's Theo. From accounting. What the hell is going on? Some kind of terrorism? Man, what are you looking at me for? I own a shoe store. Yeah, well you never know. Hey! Maybe it 's poisonous. Or some type of toxic gas or something. Poison would n't rip his arm off. And Alex and I ran through it. Well something 's in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see anything in there? Looks empty. Someone want to make a run for it? Whatever killed him could still be in there? The electronics store has a drone with a camera. Dad and I looked at it last time we were there. It 's probably fine, but let 's hurry, just in case. Okay? Start the engine! Hurry it 's getting thicker. What the hell? You ready? Yeah. Let 's hope it works, it was the only one in the store. Watch it. It 's all right, I know how to fly these things. Do you see anything? Shh! It 's closed. We 're safe. One of the other doors was opened. Let 's have a look. Looks empty. But we found the leak. Look outside. Wait. What the... Who wrote? What is it? What do you see? It 's another body. Another one? The drone... it 's stuck. This ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't happening. Look. Calm down. Everything 's going to be all right. It wo n't lift. Goddammit. Who was that? I do n't know. What did he write? Ammo? No. ARR and then something. I think it said Anna. Who the hell is Anna? Okay everyone, gather around. Here 's what we know. Three people are dead, at least. Something is clearly very, very wrong and we need to let the authorities know that we are here and alive. Now since it does n't seem to be dangerous in itself, and since whatever it is is no longer in the hallway. I suggest we send someone to the radio to call for help. I 'm not going in there. Me neither. Well someone has to. What about you? You 're the leader here. I will. If my name is drawn. We 'll do a lottery. You ca n't force people to put themselves in danger. Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. You have a better suggestion? Or you prefer to run out to one of the cars and take your chances out there. Anyone? Then that 's the way it 's going to be. Where am I going? Another mile. Then a... Then a right on Beacher. Does n't look as thick. Yeah. But why? I do n't know. God. - Watch out! - Help! I need your help! Please open up! What do we do? Get out of the car. Get out of the car. Okay. We just need the car. We just need the car. Okay. Get out of the car! Slow down! Slow down! Mia, Mia, slow down! Slow down, Mia! Slow down. Slow down! Slow down! Brakes! Is everyone okay? I 'm just gon na need a minute. Me, too. Adrian, you okay? I 'm fine. How 's my hair? Improved. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What the hell happened? When was the last time you evaded a carjacking, asshole? Nobody move. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shit! Get the door! Son of a bitch! Open! Watch the glass. I got you. Got you. What now? We run. Run where? The church. Where the hell are we? There! Wait! The guns! Mia. - Mia. - You 're not real. You 're not... You 're not real. It 's just... It 's just the withdrawal. That 's... I miss you, baby doll. You 're not... real. Come on. Let 's go! Come on! Mr. Copeland! What 's going on out there? I have no idea. Are you okay? Yeah, I think so. Is help coming? You ought to tell Clive he should start writing those circuit breaker assignments in pen, Father. You were supposed to wait for us. Calm down. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What... Who told you you could release my prisoners? You left us to die in that cell! - What are you even... - Yeah... Hey, Mia! This is a house of God! What the hell are you... Take it easy. You want to be next? Chief Heisel. Connor. - Come on. - Hey, Connor! - Hey! - Hey, take it easy. Connor. Try it again. I dare you. Yeah? You think that 's gon na make me stop calling you a pussy?! Come on. Hey! We could have been killed back there. I do n't have to explain anything to you. It 's your job to keep people safe. You left a 17yearold kid behind. I waited in the car like I said I would! Then something attacked. I honked the horn again and again, but you never came! Maybe because you were helping stage a prison break! What do you mean, you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what it was. Yeah, well, like you said, it 's my job to protect people. I did n't want to start a panic. Then what is it? What 's out there? - Eve, I 'm sorry. - Jesus. - Mom. - Do n't worry. It 'll be okay. I 'll be back soon. Just tell me what I 'm doing so I can get this over with. You should n't go alone. Clint, please. I 'm going with her. The security office. It 's going to be okay. Going to be fine. It 's gon na be okay. I know. I want you to stay with Kimmi until I get back. I just need to know you 'll be watched after right now. I love you more than anything. I 'm so sorry about Benedict. Father Romanov told me. He was a wonderful man. He was mine since I was 18. Now he 's gone, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if the bees die, humanity will only have four years left? I 'm so sorry. I mean, maybe he 's... he 's still here... in spirit? Kevin, you 're smarter than that. There is no spirit. There 's just nature. There 's here and not here. He is not here. Ready Eve? Yeah. All right. Run for it? There. Okay. Now fingers crossed the battery still has enough juice. It has juice! You okay? It 's fine. It 'll be over soon. Thought you said you were n't a junkie. I thought you said you 'd help me. What 's it like? Tell me. Maybe it 'll help. You know when you 're holding your breath and there 's that... unbearable feeling right before you relent and take a gulp of air? Well, imagine that feeling lasting for a week. I 'm sorry. Yeah, well, me, too. You know, when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... I saw a person I used to know. Except she 's dead, so... Heh. That 's what it does. Screws with your mind. Channel 19, come in. Anyone on channel 19? Over. Channel 21? Anyone on channel 21, come in. Over. Arrowhead, Arrowhead, do you copy? Over. What 's Arrowhead. I repeat! Arrowhead, Arrowhead! This is Shadow 41 standing by for report. Over. What 's Shadow 41? How do you know how to... We should take the radio back with us to the fountain. The radio stays here. Come in, Arrowhead, Arrowhead, this is Shadow 41 standing by for report. Do you copy? Over. What 's going on? I 'm going back. Not yet. Why do you have a gun? Who are you? Are you gon na have a service tonight? I was n't planning on it. I 've just been thinking a lot about Revelations. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, when I pray to God, He answers in your voice. That 's the way it is for a lot of people in this town. They need to hear your voice when they 're scared. Thank you, Link, for your concern, but one form of nourishment at a time. Please, wait for grace to be said. What if you do n't believe in God? His house, His rules. Where 's Mrs. Raven? She must have needed some time alone. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, amen. Bless us, O Lord, in these, thy gifts, which we are about to receive from thy bounty through Jesus Christ, our Lord. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, amen. Eve! She 's back. She 's back. The radio work? She okay? Give her a minute, folks. Where 's Clint? We lost each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and he was... I 'm sorry. Did you see what it was? And the radio? It was n't working. We 'll find another way. Give us a minute. You ever seen those guys before? In the mall? Around town? First time was this morning. Why? I was thinking about their families. They must be worried sick. What do we do now? Stay here for the night. Do you think Alex is okay? I 'm sure she is. I 'm sure your parents are, too. Mrs. Raven. Mrs. Raven, please. That 's only for services. I 'd like to have a drink. I 'd like to make a toast for my husband. Let the woman have a drink. Actually, let all of us have a drink. Mikhail? If God can forgive me for the things I 've done, I 'm sure He can also forgive this. Thank you. I 'd like to say a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benedict, we were n't even in our 20s. We had no money, no jobs. We were hippies and very happy about that. We had each other, and that was all that mattered. Our favorite thing was making spaghetti together and drinking cheap wine... just like this. When we got older, we settled down here. We actually had money, but we never stopped drinking cheap wine. Benedict did n't want to forget those days when we were young and had the world in our pocket... and neither do I. I 'd like us all to drink in his memory. To never forget his warmth, his kindness... and his love of cheap wine. Hey, hey! No underage drinking. Come on. You of all people should know what it can lead to. We should get some sleep. Good night. " Baby doll. " What? The old lady outside... she called you her baby doll. I saw her, too.
