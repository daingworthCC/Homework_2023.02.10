I tell you what, you 're gon na make the world 's worst waiter. Then I 'll bartend.?? You kidding me with this? Smurf again. Yeah. So as soon as we get the schedule, we pick the party with the highest rollers. I 'll do the few events, see what we find. Yeah. Just make sure you do n't get your ass fired on the first day. So what 's up? Are we gon na need everybody on this? I 'm on the inside. I 'll kill the engine and the radio. You three with guns to fleece the guests. Someone else to distract the coast guard.? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for me. " 9-1-1 "? Yeah, she probably forgot the Wi-Fi password. Why is she so pissed at you? It 's the same old shit. When mama calls, just throw the phone in the fridge. Problem solved. Yo, we keep this job between us till we 're solid. - Yeah, I 'm cool with that. - All right. - Hey, it 's Deran. - Leave a message. Go get your brothers! I can handle it here. Turn on the perimeter alarm. Watch the cameras. You feel better, baby? Let me get you some ice packs. How do I find Javi? Take a deep breath. J, what you 're feeling now is shame. There were four of them. There was nothing you could do. Nothing.?? Get in. You okay? You talk to anyone? Did you call anyone? Did you call anyone? - No, it... uh, just... just smurf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the cops, right? - All right? - Yeah. Did they hurt you? Hey. You 're safe now. Okay? - I gave them your number. - Who? I-I... the... the guy in charge. He... he had a gun. - It 's okay. - I 'm sorry. It 's all right. J? Hey. Who were those guys? Did they hurt you? No, he just put a... He had a knife to my neck, but they did n't... They did n't do anything. I 'm sorry, j.?? Okay. It 's okay. You feeling better? Yeah. You know we 're never gon na let anything happen to you. You know that, do n't you? Thank you. I need to talk to j for a minute. Why do n't you go take a nice hot shower, and I 'll have Craig bring you some oxys, okay? - Okay. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @.?? Pope fill you in on what happened? What 's Javi got on you? Uh, Luis was this dude... He was Javi 's father... And he used to run with Manny and I. We pulled a bank job. It was supposed to be super easy. But we had an unexpected visitor. We had a hero with a concealed 0.45. Hero fires, hits Lou in the gut. Lou has a shotgun, takes hero 's head off. But Lou 's already bleeding out from the gut wound and, uh, he 's not gon na make it, hospital or no. So Manny just put him out of his misery. And then we drove the body to a construction site that... I do n't know, someone just knew they were pouring the foundation for a house the next day. We buried him under it. You told us Lou ran off with the money. Javi is threatening to go to the police and let them know where the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much does he want? He wants $300k. Except Jake put a gun in my face and took off with my money. Why the hell would you trust Jake? I did n't have any options, did I? Where 'd you get 300k? My savings. You think he 's coming back? Nah, he 's got ta know we 'd be waiting for him. So what if the cops find the body? It 's been 20 years it 's been in the ground. And this... this Manny guy 's the one who shot him, so why... With my gun. He tossed it in with the body and told me about it the next day. Too late to do anything. The cops can link you to the gun? Yep. So what do you want us to do about it? We have to deal with Javi. - Deal with him? - Yes. You were gon na pay him this afternoon. - Just pay him now. - Yeah, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, maybe there 's still a way we can negotiate. This has gone way past that now. For you, it 's gone way past that. Not for us. They almost killed J. But they did n't. He 's all right. And what do you want us to do exactly? Huh? What, you want us to hunt down this guy with assault rifles for some bullshit that you did that has nothing to do with us? Do you have any idea what your life would 've been like if I took a murder rap when you were 5 years old? Yeah, well, you know what? Foster care would 've been better than this shit. You think so? I 'll tell you about it sometime. Well, J, looks like your uncles do n't really give a damn about you, does it? Nobody 's saying that, smurf. You 're saying that a group of people can come into our house and beat the shit out of him. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is saying that. If that were you lying there by the pool... Yeah. Would we even be having this conversation? We do n't just kill people. I mean, I 'm not finishing this conversation with her here, so let 's figure this out on our own.?? Just remember, Javi is not a little kid anymore. He 's angry and unstable. This does n't end until we end it. Make up your minds.?? Yeah, he 's... he 's been following her and threatening her ever since Manny 's funeral. And you did n't say shit? She asked me not to. You probably should 've shot his ass when he was in the Goddamn house. ' Cause then maybe we could say it was self-defense. - Deran. - What? I 'm just sayin ', if any of us had been here, we would n't be having this problem right now. - I 'm sorry. - What the hell was I supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns... - Yes. - Hey. Hey! - All by myself! Yes, that is what you do in that... - situation. - Hey, leave the kid alone. I 'm not killing for her, pope. And you do n't have to. All right? - We call the shots now. - Yeah, he 's right. Look at her. She thinks we 'll do it. She thinks we 'll do anything for her. And I 'll tell you one thing... I 'm not doing life in prison for some 20-year-old bullshit that has nothing to do with me. Me neither. We move the body, we take the leverage. I saw the neighborhood when I picked up Nicky. We got ta get around the homeowners. We 've done riskier jobs. Man, I-I-I steal shit for money. - I do n't kill people for old debts. - Guys, if she goes down for this, - she could bring all of us down with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is wrong with you? - Give me a break. - She wo n't! What is wrong with you, pope? I thought you hated her. No one in this family is going to prison... Oh, yeah? Not if they do n't have to. When you went to prison, she was relieved. - She was relieved. - Dude, shut up! She 's not going to prison. I 'm trying. So? We 're not killing anyone. We 're gon na move the body. What? He ca n't threaten you if he does n't have anything. We 're gon na move the body. J 's gon na be pissing blood for weeks. This is n't just about leverage. That 's the best you 're gon na get. And when he comes back? If he comes back, we will deal with it. And you have to pay them. Pay who? Deran and Craig want to be paid for their services. I 'm paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a choice? - No. - No. That 's a nice way to run things, baz. Try and get some rest.?? Hey, hang back a minute. I got ta talk to you. I need you to take point on this one. Oh, she 's just trying to get in my head. No, man, listen. I got pulled over this afternoon. Yeah, I 'm trying to stay calm, and the guy, he starts asking me about Cath. And he says he 's gon na find out what I did to her. Man, she had a bank account she never told me about. She has n't touched it since she left. - Jesus. - Yeah. Anyway, I ca n't go near the body. I-I 'm not sure if they 're watching me or not. Yeah. Yeah, okay. The cops think she 's dead. What do you think? Yeah, I think she 's dead. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been here. I 'm sorry. Beer? Oh, no. You know what? I 'm... I 'm kinda tired. Yeah. Uh... Okay. - I 'll come and check on you later. - Mm-hmm. Thanks. How 's she doing? You think they 're gon na come back? Nah, not tonight. Pope 's been walking around with that shotgun. What, you think they would 've killed smurf if she was here? That 's why he 's got the shotgun. Hey. I 'm gon na take the couch tonight. Smurf gave j my room. I 'll sleep with Lena. So, look, did Javi say anything else to you? Um, anything you can tell us that would help us? Anything at all? Smurf was supposed to pay them, but did n't show. They came here looking for money. What 'd you tell ' em? They had Nicky in the other room. I told them there was cash behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them sooner. Do n't let smurf get you killed. You played it right, man. If you 'd come out shootin ', you and Nicky would both be dead. Get some sleep. You know, I expected this halfway bullshit from your brothers, but you? A cop stopped baz this afternoon. They think he killed Cath.?? - Smurf up? - I do n't know. You 've been sitting here all night? We need the concrete saw and the sledgehammers back. Okay. You get the truck? Yeah, I talked to Nico. We 're all good. This is how it starts, you know? We do this for her, next thing you know, we 're right back here, and she 's running shit. Get the tools. Anybody want scrambled eggs? How was the couch? Okay? I 'll see you in a couple hours. Could you take Nicky and j with you? Javi 's not coming back. I know, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. We leave in five. Come here. Ally said she 'd take you to the beach. Okay? Here you go. Hey. Come here. Come here. I 'm gon na be back tomorrow, okay? - Okay. - Okay. I 've been gone a lot, right? It 's okay. You can say it. Yeah. Okay, we 'll do something together this week. Just you and me. How ' bout that? Why? Why? ' Cause I 'm your dad and I want to, that 's why. - Okay. - Okay. Come on. Sorry this is so last minute. I wo n't make a habit out of it. I do n't mind. See you tomorrow. Okay. Javi. Where??? All right, you guys go wait over there. Do n't touch anything. Come on. The cops do n't know anything. If they did, you 'd already be in cuffs. What if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Then we do n't have anything to worry about, do we? Hey, no one will tell me anything. What are we doing here? What... what are the tools for? Yeah. You know, I went for Smurf 's gun. And I would 've used it. I just could n't figure out how to load it. I never want to feel like that again. Hey. You remember when we were kids, we used to fight over the game boy? Smurf would make us hit each other over and over again - till one of us quit? - Yeah. I always used to kick your ass. Uh, you were scrappy. No, you were huge, even when you were 6. You used to let me win. Did n't wan na kill you. Smurf would get so pissed. She thought I 'd never learn how to fight. She 'd sic pope on you. Well, do n't feel bad. I was bigger than him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smurf is always talking about how we have to have each other 's backs. But she loved when we fought. Yeah. It 's Nico. Hey. What 's up, man? We good? - It 's in the alley. - All right, let 's go. Uniforms? - In the back. - All right. All right, so we 'll drop the car off at the airport long-term parking. You can pick it up tomorrow morning, okay? All right, look, no blood in my truck. - Just picking up some old shit. - Thanks, Nico. Got a couple more things to do in the office, then we 'll get out of here, okay? All right. Okay, so the bullets are in the clip. Wan na push that in there... - all the way until it clicks. Okay. - Mm-hmm. All right, now... Pull it up. Keep your finger on the side there. Okay, now you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A bit harder. There you go. Okay, now that 's ready to fire, so be careful. Well, how do I aim it? See these white dots? Mm-hmm. You wan na line those up right where you wan na shoot, okay? Bring your elbows in, turn your body to the side a little bit. There you go. And then, when you 're ready, you just keep firing until the clip runs out. Thank you. Do n't let Deran see that in here. Put it away. We got ta go. - That 's the one. - Are you sure? I have n't been here in 20 years. I was n't expecting to come back, either. We 're not going in unless you 're sure.?? That 's it. That 's the one. It 's right next to the drainage ditch on the southeast side of the street. Whose idea was this place? Jake 's. He was working some construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I thought you ran that crew. Manny shot him, Jake buried him, and you just... Watched??? I 'm sorry to hear about Julia. What the hell are you doing, Javi? You remember this place? We used to smoke a lot of shit down here. You, me, and pope. Yeah, I remember. She tell you about my dad? Yeah, she did. What 'd she say? That Manny did it? She shot him in the back of the head, then threw his body in a hole, and then told me my dad was a piece of shit who ran out on me. Okay, so what do you want to do about it? You wan na kill her? ' Cause we 're never gon na let that happen. So if you want something else, let 's start negotiating. Man, you know, every birthday, Christmas, I thought, " oh, this is it. This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought ' cause she took you in, she 'd take me in, too. Bro, I spent the last 20 years wiping Manny 's ass and doing small-time 211 's in the middle of Goddamn nowhere. You know and smurf seems like she 's just doing fine, man, like she did n't lose no sleep. So do you wan na go back to Arizona with nothing, or do you wan na get paid? I already tried. I asked for money. She did n't show. She 's not running things anymore. I can get you the money. Hmm. Keys to the kingdom, huh? How does pope feel about that? Well, he does n't feel great about you threatening smurf, I 'll tell you that. Look, you took 25 from the house. It 's gon na cost at least 10 to fix the wall, plus the bullshit with the kid and the girlfriend. - Let 's call it 200. - No, no, 400 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dude, I ca n't go back to my crew with 200. Come on. I 'm trying to help you here, man. It 's 200 or it 's nothing. Those are your choices. What do you wan na do? You remember when your dad used to get loaded and kick the shit out of you in front of Smurf 's yard? Man, you 've come a long way from crying yourself to sleep and pissing the bed, man. Good for you. ' Cause, you know, shit did n't turn out so well for me or my dad.?? It 's all right. You know, Manny used to always say that smurf would climb over her own kids just to keep from drowning. Be careful, bro. That 's all I 'm saying. You 're not even her kid.?? So we have a deal??? Good. The body 's buried along the back wall. - How deep did you bury it? - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concrete would save us, and we did n't have that much time. The gun with it? - Should be. - Should be? It is. I 'm sorry, baby. Would you give us another second, please? I 'm not stupid. I know who you are. I know what you do. You 're right. You 're a smart girl. And we should tell you the truth. Thanks. But not now. Next time. Now do you have someplace else you can sleep tonight? - Yeah. - Okay, go get packed. Tools? - Yeah. - Truck? Parked it down the street. You got ta pay Javi. 200 instead of 300 because of what he did to j. I know you do n't like it, and you do n't have to, but it 's what we got ta do right now. I 'm sorry. And that 's fair, smurf. You owe him. Okay. When? Two hours. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll meet you at the Van. Are you sure you should go with her? She 's not going alone. What about the cops? - If I get a tail, I 'll lose it. - Yeah. - Good luck. - You, too. So where 'd you get the money to pay Javi? I told you. My savings. Mm, that 's bullshit. You 've been skimming off our work. I 'm the only one in this family who can see past the next Goddamn party. Okay. Great, so time to dip back in. Do I drive you to a bank? How does it work? You really think I have more, do n't you? Jake took everything I have, and Javi cleaned out this house. Well, did n't you boys just come into a bit of church money? Smurf, you got ta be kidding me. Well, we could show up with nothing and see how he takes it. You 're paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to sell the house, you 're gon na do it.???? Let 's go.?? Hi. Good afternoon, ma'am. Uh, there were reports of a gas leak in the area. We have to ask you to leave while we make sure everything 's okay. The bruises will get worse before they get better. And you 're gon na need proper stitches in that leg. I can do it for you, if you want. It 's up to you. I know you think we should kill him. But have you ever hurt somebody? Really hurt them? Does n't feel like you think it will. Thank you.?? Down there on the left. I 'll get the tools. Got a new car? It 's a loaner. Challenger needs a new transmission. Baz, how do you know we 're not driving straight into an ambush? He 'll take the money.?? Somebody following us? Just being careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Bingo. Pipe. We got a hit. Gun. Shit, how much gas did you guys pour in here? All right, let 's tear it up.?????? Stop.?? What 's going on here? Wait here. What 's he doing here? Hey, there 's two of you. Are we gon na have a problem? Why do n't you tell her to get out of the car? Javi... Got your money right here. I wan na talk with her. Javi, your dad 's been dead for 20 years. She is never gon na say she 's sorry. Take the money.???? Gun. That 's it. What, did this guy only have one foot? We 're missing one. Shit. Man, it 's not here. Keep digging. Look, man, we have the gun. Huh? We 're not leaving without a Goddamn foot. Get out of the way. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to leave. Guys, we got a bunch of neighbors on the front lawn, asking questions. Pope. What do you want me to do? Maybe it 's not even here. It 's got ta be there. Where else could it be? I 'm telling you, cops are n't going to ID a foot. Let 's just leave it. Shut up. Okay, well, we got about 15 minutes before the old lady calls dispatch and finds out there 's no leak. I 'm moving as fast as I can. Wait. Hey, is that it? There we go. Good job, bro. Let 's get the hell outta here.?? Got it? - Javi? - Get out of here. Go. I really do owe you an explanation, huh? You know all that bullshit about me not having any room? That was just silly. I did n't take you in because you were worthless. You were stupid and angry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ.?? Bury the body over the fence. Get rid of your gun. Here you go. That 's it. That 's all you 're getting. Is that all in there? It 's there. The other 50 is in a building on ventura. It 's called the Lisbon. Mailbox 5c. Get it out of there tonight, and get yourself out of California.?? Well, we 're all done in there. We had to, uh, dig up part of the floor to get to the pipe. But, uh, dispatch will give you a call, send someone out to patch it up. But thank you so much. You 've been very kind. Do n't expect me to help you when this comes back to bite us! I 'm not doing it! You would n't do what needed to be done. I found someone who would. We have the body! He was gon na take the money! I mean, what? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh, my God, smurf. You do n't know that. - You don't. - His own crew knew that! They wanted the money. He just wanted revenge. And it was n't very difficult to convince Deek to take him out. I mean, come on, smurf. We grew up with that kid. He was like family to us. And " like family " is n't family. Yeah.?? You are family. Come on. So what did you say? " There 's an 8-foot hole in your ground. Sorry? " I told her, uh, dispatch would give her a call, that we 're, uh, gon na send over Ronny to come fix it tomorrow. You know, fat Ronny, our best guy.?? Everything all right? Synchronized by srjanapala??? face the fire?? let it go?? on the edge...? what do you want us to do with this???? Hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ooh, ooh, ooh??
