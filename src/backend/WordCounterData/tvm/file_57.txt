Reconstructive, cosmetic. There will be pain. A great deal afterwards, extreme discomfort I 'm not afraid of pain We could n't begin to operate until the scar tissue softens, and that could be several weeks That 's alright Do you have a recent photograph of yourself?

Would have thought the world was coming to an end Now it 's as if she never even existed Stephanie Harper has n't been forgotten Certainly not by me I find it hard to believe, that after three separate searches two organized by this company that still a body has not been found Something, a skeleton Everything that could be done, has been done Well, I 'm not satisfied Really? Do you honestly mean to tell me that this huge organization with all its resources that can manage to find uranium, iron ore, gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones? You hypocrite your only reason for wanting Stephanie 's death legally established is money Well, I loved Stephanie Harper, she was like a daughter to me and it 's a pity you never took the trouble to get to know her before she died She was n't perfect, but she was warm and cared about people Every begging letter that arrived, she 'd read, and some she 'd cry over and she 'd give and give and give and all she ever asked for herself was to be accepted for what she was, rather than who she was She tried damn hard, and that 's ever tough for everyone Yes, I 'd love the chance to give Stephanie a proper funeral but I 'm glad they did n't find the body because I want you to sweat out every moment of the next seven years after that time, you 're legally entitled to a slice of one of the biggest fortunes in Australia But I should point out, that before Stephanie married you I persuaded her to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-deceasing you, and you re-married, you forfeit the lot Meantime, you can try getting a job Working for a living might prove a pleasant change Yes! - Mr. Dell? - That 's right I 'm the lady who rang about the room Oh, good The ad said $50 a week That 's right.
