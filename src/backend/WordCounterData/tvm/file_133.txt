5235041 NARRATOR : Previously on Third Watch : Holy Mary, Mother of God. I 'm pregnant. Congratulations. I tell you what. Why do n't we just call in sick? When does Brooke get off? Get across the street. What 's wrong with you? [GUNSHOTS] SULLY : I 'm not afraid of much, really. Not blood or snakes or rats. Not even heights. One time I stepped over the fence in the mide of the George Washington Bridge to help a jumper get back. Two hundred and fifteen feet to the water. But everybody has something that makes their skin crawl. Something that wakes them up from a deep sleep in the middle of the night drenched in sweat, reaching for the bedside lamp. My nightmare comes to visit maybe once a month. It stalks me. It slips in, bringing with it the smell of wet dirt and confined space. See, I 'm terrified of being buried alive. TY : Hey. Any luck? - No. Wan na call the precinct and have them send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be the first guy to lose a set of keys, Sully. Either shut up or get your chatty ass down here and help me look.

Why do n't we just drive it over to the shelter, let them deal with it? - I 'm not getting back in with that thing. - You got a better idea? We called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for her. How could she just wander off? She 's 87 years old! It takes a half an hour to make it to the television room! Look, I understand you 're upset, but this is not a jail.

HELLER : You okay? You look flushed. Yeah. It 's a sunburn. I 've been working outside today. I 'm afraid your mother 's probably gon na need to be in a more secured unit. And with her declining mental status, she 's not aware of her surroundings. How much? It 's gon na cost more, right? - Around a hundred and fifty. - A day? - Medicaid pay for it? - No. Nice little profit center, is n't it? I guess it might be if we had a secured unit. Sorry. Okay. We 're gon na take a bath now, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right. Let 's take the shirt off. Hey, it 's okay. It 's okay. Come on. No? Water 's ready. All right. Guess I 'm gon na go first. Water looks good too. And if you 're not coming, that 's your problem. Let 's go. Shirt off. All right. Guess I 'm going in by myself. All right. Good job. Let 's take these smelly shoes off. Sheila gave up a banana and I found some peanut butter. You ready to get wet? All right? Oh, you 're heavy. I called Family Services and pediatric psych are on the way. Okay, thanks. Okay.

You ca n't go out with your nightgown on. Her hands are freezing. I think we need to get you home, Irene. Is that okay? Gabe, get the door, please. SULLY : Come on, it 's okay. Here we go. Can I take her back in my car? - Sure. You know the way? - No. - Well, you can follow us. - Okay. We 're gon na get you home, Mom, so we can get you warm. You scared me. That was a day well-spent. We 'll be back out here tomorrow. I promise you that. The guy 's probably dead anyway. Shot him, buried him. They grab the ransom and run. That 's what I 'd do. FAITH : There 's your dogs, Bos. BOSCO : It 's about time. You guys know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cord to your finger in a coffin and run it out to a bell? So if you were n't really dead and you woke up you could just pull the cord and ring the bell. That 's where " saved by the bell " comes from. - No kidding? TY : Yeah. I mean, could you imagine being out there just buried for more than a day not knowing if you 're gon na be found or just-- What do you think 's going through his mind? " Damn, I could have had a V8 "? You 're a sick puppy, Bos. You know that? [PANTING] No! Stop it, please! No! No! No! Stop! Please stop! Oh, Mom. Mom! Mom.

She knew every inch of that park. Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door of this room. Can I take her home, take care of her myself? It 'd be very difficult. She needs 24-hour-a-day care. I feel like a terrible son. You 're here. Lots of people, they just dump them off never come back to see them. But I promised that I would take care of her make sure that she was safe, never alone. It 's so strange. When I look at her, I see my mother. She looks back and she ca n't see me. Maybe he does n't understand English? I tried Spanish. But he did n't respond. MONTVILLE : Scrapes and bruises. Some lice. Couple of small bites, probably from rats. But no signs of physical abuse. What would you call leaving a kid on the streets? Neglect. He 's malnourished and dehydrated. But nothing a meal and some apple juice wo n't fix. Family Services been here yet? No. Police took some Polaroids, but there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just walk away from a four-year-old child? Kim : Probably OD 'd over on 96th Street. And a lot of shooting galleries over there. I hope somebody does show up so the cops can arrest them for child abandonment. Sleepy, huh? Good night, little guy. Good luck. When I was a kid, my dad took me to a Yankee game. Righetti pitched a no-hitter against the Red Sox. Fourth of July. It was awesome. We got separated on the subway on the way home. I ended up in Brooklyn. Dark, raining. I did n't know where I was. I 'll never forget that. Ca n't stay here all shift, you know. Just wait till Social Services gets here, okay? He should n't have to be alone anymore today. I 'm gon na get some coffee in the lounge. [BUZZES] - We 're closed. - Yeah. Yeah, look, remember me from this afternoon? The cockatoo. It was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know we asked you to take it, but I do n't think it 's dangerous.

TY : How 's your mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah. TY : She was n't hurt or anything? - No. - Must be a relief. - Yeah. BOSCO : Hey. Marcantonio, what 's up?
