5219341 Shoot, shoot, shoot the animal Run, run, run to Canada Where are we? How specific do you want me to be? How specific can you be? Try Australia. We 're getting there. It 'd help if we knew where " there " was. Dace knows where he 's going. Ooh, easy. I bet he does. What does that mean? Kris has got a boyfriend Kris has got a boyfriend Holy shit! Oh, hello. What 's this? Do n't you dare. Oh, I think I dare. Do n't you dare! Warren, Warren! Do n't you fucking dare. Do n't! Warren! Fucking do n't you dare. Fucking give it here! It 's not yours, Warren. Do n't open it. If it was mine, I would n't want to open it. Whatever. Open it. I do n't care. Eh, I do n't want to open your dumb bag. Grow up, Warren. Get over it, Chad. I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on. They 're your family heirlooms. I just wish there was more detail. There 's plenty of detail. It all checks out. He was a total nutcase. Wow, really? He was your uncle. You said he was reliable. He was my great-great-great uncle, Chad, and it was 120 years ago, and I did n't say he was reliable. I just said we were n't taking parenting tips from the man and that he 's unlikely to have hallucinated these rock paintings. What 's wrong with rock paintings closer to home? What have you got against them? These paintings have n't been seen for 120 years, that 's what. There is n't a doctorate in paintings closer to home. Sorry, lassie. I 'm bored. Well, we could play a game. Great. I spy with my little eye... No, a game 's a good idea. Like what? I do n't know. 20 questions? We could play backpacker. How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backpacker, then we murder them and dump their body in a ditch. Warren! Sorry, Anja. That 's fine. Do n't worry about it. Sorry? Sorry? She gets... she gets a sorry? Where 's my apology, you cunt? Where is it? Give me one! Come on, Warren! Sorry, Angina. I forgot you do n't like the C word. Are you serious? What 's not to like? It 's not that I do n't like it, Smell. Ah, come on. I could feel your eyes roll. It 's about context. Ah, context. So what context would you be cool with it in? Give it a rest. Come on. I want an answer. I 'll let you know when I think of one. How about, " Get down there, boy, and lick my cunt "? Hey! What? What? I say it to Chad all the time. You do not. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ooh, baby, maybe I will. This one 's malfunctioning. I 'm kidding, baby. Chad, I 'm kidding. I love my little Chaddikins. I do n't know. I still wish we had more to go on. So? Ye of little faith. Everybody out, please. Ah, thank God. Oh, yay. Bags not sitting in the middle next time. Guys, be careful when you 're walking on the rocks. Chad, how sweaty is your back? I need to go to the toilet. Do you think I could cop a squat over here? Coming. Thanks, guys. Look out for snakes. I wish all the ladies I wish all the ladies Were sculptures of Venus Sculptures of Venus And I was a sculptor I was a sculptor I 'd sculpt them with my... Penis Singing, hey, boppa-loobah Hey, boppa-loobah Mel? Mel? Hey, it 's over here. Ah! Spiderwebs! Oh, here we are. Everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anja. We 'll quickly go through, and then we 'll come back for the stuff. Oh, rocks. Shit. Okay, watch your heads. Yep. Dace, were you ever a prefect at school? Where 's Anja? Anja? Anja, hey. Kris? Are you okay? I 'm fine. I just need a moment. You do n't have to do this, An. Can you talk to me? About what? Anything. Something happy. Pregnant. Pregnant? " Pregnant " is my happy word. Every time I hear it, I get a rush of joy. Are you serious? It 's all I want is to have babies. You 're 23. I know. It 's... it 's silly. Whoa, look at this. It 's beautiful. Mmm, oh, my sensitive boy. So cute. What? You have to be sensitive to find this beautiful? Or gay. Watch the puddle. Gah! Warren! Fuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really? I ca n't wait. Fuck. Oh, yes, you can. Keep moving. Dace! Dace! Anja. What? Anja, you blacked out. Yeah. Better let me check you out. No, I 'm okay. Just let me check. You could be concussed. She did n't hit her head. She blacked out. There 's something wrong with that tunnel. We should n't go through it. Anja, do n't be ridiculous. It 's perfectly safe. It 'll take us five minutes if we walk through the tunnel and probably hours to drive around the mountain. She had a panic attack. Well, why did n't you say? It was n't the same. It was different from last time. Here 's what we 're going to do. We are going to go to the car and get the stuff that we need, go through the tunnel and set up camp, and you are going to drive around and meet us up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. At some point, you 've got to get over this shit. What? It 's only a fucking tunnel. How much longer? Yes! We have daylight. Oh, my God. Wow. Look at that. Forget that. Check this out! Oh. Ah, it 's actually kind of beautiful. Oh, my God. Eh, I 've seen better. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Find it all right? Thanks to yours truly. Found this one running around screaming, waving his arms like a girl. Hey, you 'll keep. I want to get my pink bag. There 's a few things I want to just check. What do I do with this? Chuck it in the back? Mine and mine. Where 's... where 's my bag? It 's mine. Which way? Here. The mossies are psychotic. Finally. Pookie, I 'm gon na put you there. Hi, baby. Wait, wait, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah, to be young and in love. Ah, to be young and fucking. Where 's Dace and Kris? Speaking of young and fucking. They 're not. Give them time. They 're at the rock painting. Is it good? Oh, you know, there 's rock. There 's paint. Ticks all the boxes. Hey, check this out. Whoa, billabong! Well, I would n't drink from it. If you want water, there 's a brook a little further on. Great for swimming in, though. Great for swimming? That sentence makes no sense. It 's just a bunch of words randomly shoved together. Jesus, Mel, a little bit of respect. What the fuck? Fucking insects. Oh, here. Come on, I 'll show you those rock paintings. Whoa, nobody 's seen this painting for 120 years. Okay, Dace, what 's it all mean? Well, as near as I can tell, it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctorate, and get a job on TV. What is that? That is gruesome. Looks like weird squid porn, if you ask me. Well, it does. This color here, this pigmentation, it 's usually related to death or danger or something. Hey, hey! What? Do n't touch it. Sorry. Do you want to go get dinner on? Love to. Just after I 've poked out my eyeballs and inserted them up my anus. Anus later. Dinner first. So what do you think? I think it 's beautiful. No, what do you think it 's about? Well, I could be wrong, but I think it 's about that. You reckon? I do n't know. Probably not. No, no, no. You could be right. But if you ask me, I think it 's about that. Typical. What? Why? No reason. No, I 'm being serious. I think that 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am being scientific here. Of course you are. What? What what? You 're kind of sexy when you mess with my head. What? Something attacked me. Really? Shit. Come on, you little fucker. Have another go. Yummy. Are they chicken? Nope. Beef. Beefy beef. Oi. Look what just attacked us. Oh, what is it? Fucking rabbit. Bullshit. Look at this. Whoa, you better get that thing checked. It might have rabies. We do n't have rabies in Australia. Here, get a load of its teeth. Whoa. That 's gross. There 's something wrong with that. I know. That 's why I am making an example of it. Yeah! Yeah, that 'll teach ' em. Freaky-assed mutant rabbit will think twice before attacking you again. You ca n't leave it there. It 'll stink. Do n't be such a girl. Yeah, what 's with you? First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah, you got a context for me yet? Oh, at least wash your hands, you skank. Careful! Careful! Mmm! Come on, just one. Just use it in a sentence. Just give me one example. Oh, seriously. Come on, Warren, give us a song. Sometimes you need to get away Blow the town and flee the fray Where night is night, and day is day And just sit on your ass Perfect nights are made like this Firelight and a woman 's kiss Freaky-assed mutant rabbit on a stick And the wide-open sky Where are you two going? Ah, just looking at the stars. They 're really amazing out here. Dace is turning the S.N.A.G. Up high Yee-haw Showing little Krissy the stars in the sky But we all know That 's just another tired old line So he can bone her blind Oh, please. Whoo! Maybe Chad and I should come and join you guys. Well, yeah, it 's not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait outside. I 'm sure he would n't mind, would you, Chad? Whatever. Nasty Mel making Chaddikins angry? Be like that then. I 'm going swimming. What, now? Yeah, it 's the best time. Your bathers are in the tent. Chad, we 're in the middle of nowhere. We do n't need bathers. Whoo-hoo! Yeah, baby! Ow! Oh... Hey, Chad. Come in. Nude up. Get your winky wet. Come on. It 's beautiful. Towel 's there when you need it. You being a whiny bitch? How about a bit of fucking dignity? What? You heard me. I 'm skinny-dipping in the middle of nowhere. How does that affect my dignity? Chad, how does that affect my dignity? Oh, Chad. Chad, wait. Chad, wait. Fuck. What? Get them off me! Get them off me! Hey, do n't rip them off. Chuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em off me! Get ' em off me! Get ' em off me! Get ' em off me! Stand still. Get ' em off me! Quick! Ow! They 're everywhere! Quick! Quick! All done. Are they gone? Are they gone? You need to check. Check, check. That 's it. I guess swimming 's out, then. See you in the morning. Night. Looks like we 're sharing a tent. If we really must. So how are you going with everything? Oh, you know. Bit up and down. I know it 'll get better with time. It 's just, I 've got this inescapable feeling I 've just got shit taste in men. An, you ca n't blame yourself for David. I mean, we all knew he was a tool, but none of us saw that coming. Yeah, but that 's just it. I did n't know he was a tool. And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Yeah, you 're right. You 've got shit taste in men. You know the thing I ca n't forgive myself for? When it came to the crunch, when I should have fought back, I blacked out. An, that 's bullshit. And today in the tunnel... Maybe I am a born victim. Anyone who spends a week locked in a basement is gon na have a little bit of baggage. If it 's just a little bit of claustrophobia. You 're doing pretty damn well. I 'm going to get some sleep. I might sleep out here by the fire and keep watch in case any more of those freaky-assed mutant rabbits attack. Thanks. His heart breaks as she walks away Her chest heaving and her hips a-sway Oh, well, tomorrow 's another day Shut up, Warren. He 'll just have to wait Night, Warren. An, can you have a look at Mel? She 's got a fever. Hey, baby. How 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of this suit. Oh, Melly, you 're burning up. Let 's get you out of this. I do n't know how people wear them every day. It 's the leeches. They 've got to be poisonous. Leeches are n't poisonous. There 's no mileage in it for them. They 're parasites. They do secrete anticoagulants and stuff. Looks like an allergic reaction to me. Well, should we get her to a hospital? No, we should n't move her, not yet anyway. Best thing for her is rest. What do you know? You 're not a doctor. If it was serious, she 'd be anaphylactoid. " Anaphylactoid "? That 's not even a word. Listen, we give her panadol for the fever, and we see how she is in the morning. I 've got antihistamines. Yeah. That 's a good idea. Ah, boring. Who fucking let him make a speech? Get ' em off. Chaddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these, baby. Chad... Chaddy? Chad? Mm? Chaddy? Can you hear the bells? Babe? Hmm? Chaddy? Shit, baby... Oh, Jesus. That 's it. I 'm gon na take a break. There 's fucking chunks in this burger. Oh! I found a penny. What 's wrong with her teeth? Shh. Get Dace. Get Dace! Get Dace! What 's going on? We got ta get her to a doctor. Settle down. Do n't tell me to settle down. Look, these paintings have n't been seen for over a century. It 's the find of a lifetime. Fuck. We 're not leaving just ' cause someone 's got a fever! She 's hallucinating. Her teeth are falling out. It took us ages to get here! Take a look at her, Dace. Christ. Um, do you know the way back to the last town? Yeah, I reckon. Okay, if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid-afternoon at the latest. Um, fuck. I 'm gon na stay here and work on the paintings. I 'll stay with you. Take what you need. Chad, help me get her to the car, come on. What food do we want? Stuff we do n't have to cook. All right. Can I help carry her? No, I 've got her. You go help Warren. Dace, we 've got to get out of here. There 's all these bugs eating everything. Open the door. Dace, they 've been through everything in my tent. They 've destroyed it all. Warren, did you leave us enough food? Are you fucking listening to me? Yes. Insects. Whatever. What is it? What the fuck? That 's what I 've been trying to tell you. What are we gon na do? We 're gon na have to walk it. Yep. Okay. Let 's get her back into the tent. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretcher. We can make one out of a camp bed. Here. I 'll be outside, baby. What can I do? I 've known you for two years, still got no idea. What 's up your ass? I do n't know. Maybe that my whole fucking thesis has gone to shit because of your girlfriend. She did n't get sick just to spite you. Well, I did n't tell her to go swimming with leeches, did I? And I did? She 's your girlfriend. Why do n't you try a tighter leash? And we 're going through that tunnel. What? Shaves half a day 's hiking off. Jesus, Dace. I ca n't. I told you. We have to, An. I 'll help you through it. Mel? You should n't be out here, Smelly. Mel? Ah! Rah! Kris, come behind me! Mel! Mel! What the fuck? What 's wrong with her? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Episode? Did you see her teeth? Nasty fucking teeth. Fucking leeches? Fuck. Where 's the first aid kit? It 's in the car. I 'll get it. Fuck. Fuck. Dace, get back! What 's wrong with her? What 's wrong with her? Do n't know, Chad. Oh... How bad is it? It 's really messy. It needs to be stitched. I 've got a sewing kit in the car. You 're not fucking sewing me up. It 's okay. I can make do. Good, because I 'm not going back to the car. That painting 's not a story. It 's a warning. Go through those photos. See if there 's anything there that 'll help. She hardly felt this log, and I was n't holding back. Yeah, I noticed. Whatever 's wrong with her, she 's still Mel. Uh! Okay, what do we do? Well, we ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us. We 've got to run. No, we 've got to stay here. She 's afraid of the fire. Got to use that to our advantage. How? Dace? The way I see it, we got two options. And they are? We either trap her, or we kill her. Whoa, whoa, Dace. This is Mel! I know killing shit is kind of like your default position... This is bad. She needs our help, you prick, and you want to kill her. I kind of like Mel. Shut up! He 's right. What? He did n't say we 're gon na kill her. He said they 're our options, right? Yeah. Right. Well, we 're not killing her. Okay. So we trap her. Okay. Chad, you 're the bait. You stay here. The moment you see her, get to the edge of the trap. Stay there. Do I get one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't get jack, so try not to get killed. I 'm gon na be up in the tree with the ropes. The moment she sets foot onto the trap, I 'm gon na jump down and spring it, using my body weight to... Haul her up. You guys go into different parts of the bush, flush her out. How do we do that? Wave your torch. Make some noise. When she sees you guys have got flame and Chad does n't, she 's gon na go for Chad, all right? And if she does n't? Well, you make sure you keep the flame between you and her, you 'll be fine. Come on, guys, let 's do it. Fucking hell. Dace? Shut up. Mel? Melly? Mel? Mel? Mel? Fucking nature. What 's the fucking point? What 'd it ever do for me? Fucking nothing, that 's what. Fucking rocks and moss and grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mel? She 's over here! Mel? Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Run! Fuck this! Ahh... Chad! Fuck! She 's coming! Give us a hand. That was intense. Now what? Dace? You got nothing. No plan? We 've got Chad 's saber-toothed girlfriend stuck in a tree, and that 's it? Chuck me the ropes. Jesus fucking Christ, are you serious? That 's it? Chuck me the fucking ropes. All right, this is great! Quarter of a billion alpha males in the world, and we get the dog shit one. Shut up, Warren. No, I do n't think I fucking will. I 'm getting really sick of your negativity. Everything 's a fucking joke to you. Well, this is a fucking joke. You want a plan. Here 's the plan. The moment she gets down... Fuck! Fuck me! Grab it! Ah! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up. You 've been a bad, bad girl. Warren! Fuck! No! There. Warren... Dace! Dace! Dace! Dace! Get out of the water! The leeches! Oh, God! Is there anything on me? There 's nothing. There 's nothing. Warren? No! No! Oh, no, no! This is bullshit. What is? This is! Jesus Christ, when are we gon na call a spade a spade? We 've got to work out what 's wrong with her. I do n't care what 's wrong with her. The only thing I care about is what we do now. We ca n't help her if we do n't know. Help her? Help her? Wake up and smell the viscera, Chad! Oh, Jesus. Hey! Get out of here! Go on, get! Get out of here! We have to kill her. I 'm gon na pretend you did n't just say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I 'm not buying any of your psycho survivalist bullshit. She fucking killed Warren. She 's sick. She 's eating him. She needs help. She 's fucking eating him! Enough. Go on! Get out of it! She needs help. You need help. She needs to be dead. He 's right. She 's gon na kill all of us. We do n't have a choice. You people are fucked up. I do n't want to die, Chad. And Mel does? It 's us or her, dickhead. You on board with this? Yeah. This is so fucking wrong. That 's not Mel anymore, Chad. I 'm not giving up on her. How do we do it? What weapons do we have? None. Knives, bottles, anything? No, useless. This is sharp. No, we wo n't get anywhere with that. Well, what then? Um, fuck, we need the machete. Machete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in the back of the car. Well, how are we gon na get it? We 'll take torches. We go over there. And one of us goes in and gets it, and the others stand guard. I do n't want to go. I do n't want to go. Kris, come on. We need you. Count me out. Come on, Simon. We need all hands on deck. What? What? You called me Simon. Chad. Fuck. Whatever. Ah, fuck. Forget him, okay? Three 's enough. Okay. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let 's take these. Okay. We get over there as quickly as we can. Kris, you go in and get it. Anja, do n't forget the pudding. Dace? Ah? I hate Christmas. Everyone hates Christmas. But Mum busted a gut over this. Fuck. They got him. The fucking leeches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the water. What are we gon na do? Get him the fuck away from me. Settle down. I 'm serious. Why would you paint your house orange? Fuck. It 's doing my head in. Jesus! What are we going to do? We have to kill him. Yeah. Yeah, we have to kill him. Nice about-face. You 've seen how strong Mel is. We do n't stand a chance against this prick. We have to, Anja, now. What 's the problem, Anja? You were all for killing Mel. He was all for killing Mel, for Christ 's sake. You know, we got to do this. Quickly, before he turns. Who 's going to do it? We draw straws. I mean it. We draw straws. Who 's first? Fuck. Here. Grab a knife. Come on. Quick. Take one. Package over there. Just grab it. Meet me in the cafe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on, Anja. Take a knife. Take it! Ow. It 's okay now, Dace. You get some sleep. Yeah. It 's really good to see you, sis.

Fuck you and your fucking straws. What was that? That was n't Mel. Well, what could it be? Shit! Shit. Shit. Shit. Chad, get Dace. What? Get a knife and finish him. You drew the short straw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Useless. We 're gon na die. No, there 's still time. We 've got to get that machete. Then what? Then we kill them both before Dace is up and running. And no more bullshit from you. That thing out there, that 's not Mel. We 're killing it. I 'm getting a torch. We need to follow them. We need to know where they 're going. Who 's going to the car? I will. Now? There 's Dace. Where 's Mel? Mel, I know you 're in there. That 's good. Keep her attention. I 'll try to get Dace. I know you 're in there, baby. You 're everything to me. I 'm not gon na abandon you, but you 've got to fight this, sweetheart. I know you can do it. You 're the strongest person I 've ever known. But you got to fight. You got to find your way out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Here, baby. It 's Pookie. He 's missing you. He 's missing you. I 'm going to put down the torch. I 'm putting it down, baby.

What 's the matter, Mel? Afraid of the dark? Come on, Mel. It 's only a fucking tunnel. It 's here. It 's here. It 's here. No! Run, Kris! Kris, run. Let her go! Come on. We got to help her. It 's too late. What was that back there with that toy? What do you want from me, Anja? I just want you to do what we agreed to do. I did what we agreed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down your torch! You put down your torch! I was trying to reach her. That thing out there, that 's not Mel. You do n't reach that, Chad. She 's an animal. She 's scared of fire, for fuck 's sake. Kris? If she 's scared of something, that means there 's still something left. The tunnel. What? They 're scared of it. What? How do you know? Because when I went in there, she did n't follow me in. Well, what? So what about it? So we go through the tunnel. At the very least, it buys us some time. If we 're lucky, we lose them altogether. What about your claustrophobia? We 'll try and get up there without being seen. There 's two of them now. It 'll be that much easier for them to pick one of us off, which is why I 'm not using this unless we have to. Keep moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on. Chad, come on. Fuck. I 'm sorry. Come on, Chad. It 's not her anymore. Chad. Come on. It 's not her. Come on, Chad. We 're nearly there. Come on. Fuck.
