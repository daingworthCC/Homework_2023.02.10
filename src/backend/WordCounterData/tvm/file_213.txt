It 's elmo 's versionof a phone tree. But not everybody has a phone, so we go house to house, each person in charge of another person. Look.I just added you. Oh, I 'm honored. Well, who am I in charge of? Well, no one yet. ' Cause you 're the end. I thought I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, you are on. Whoo! Hey, elmo. I have been hard at work, trying to dig up this little tree in my backyard. But the thing just wo n't budge. Well, that should n't surprise me, seeing that it is an elmo tree, and elmo is town so tight that even the trees want to stick around. But still, it amazes me. This town. That tree. How can something so small have such deep roots? Hey, you leaving me? I 'm putting together our emergency bag, silly. I should have done it years ago. Hmm, well, do n't forget to pack my slippers and my super bowl suspenders. How are suspenders gon na help you in an emergency? You ever try running with your pants down around your ankles?

Oh, are you hiding my birthday present in there? Not exactly. I do n't have time for your little games. I just want to hang up... Dear god, what is that?! I passed gas. In my closet? I did n't want to do it in front of you. It 's too early in the relationship. I was trying to keep the romance alive. The cat 's out of that closet. I would have lit a match, but I did n't want your acrylic uniforms to go up in flames. Next time, just get yourself outside before you do... that. I 'll try. But it 's hard to control. Well, try.

Man, you are cranky. I 'm sorry. I did n't mean to jump all over you. I 'm just annoyed that I ca n't get anything done these days. I can help you with that. I am not sleeping with you. I 'm not talking sex. I 'm talking spiritual rebirth. So, he 's a therapist? He 's more like a soul healer. Wait a minute, he 's not one of those quacks who 's gon na charge me $500to clean my aura? Master todd really helped me. Master todd? Seriously? That 's his name? Yes, it is. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where does this guy live? Wait a minute. Are you taking me to see rumpelstiltskin? Sorry.

Only then will you be free. That 's it? Pay the guy. How much? I do n't do thisfor the money. Is a 20 okay? 50 would be better. Thank you, master todd. Call me todd. It has been an experience, todd. Uh, not you. Mom? Yes, baby? Can I have my night-light? Of course you can. It 's scary tonight. It 's just the wind. Nothing bad 's gon na happen to you. Promise? I promise. I will always take care of you. You know I 'm only doing this so I can write about it for my book. Maybe master todd meant you 'd feel better if you drank something on the rocks, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where 's your " jack " rock? He does n't deserve a rock. Is n't he kind of a big issue for you? Oh, why is everyone hung upon this? I just think you have togive yourself permission to mourn what you and jack had. It was real.It happened. It takes time to get over that. I know it happened. He 's the onewho seems to have forgotten and gotten engaged to someone else. Bitter. Would n't it be great if all problems could be solved with a rock? Hey. Everything okay? It will be. I 'm fine. Are you sure? Yeah. You want a rock? I think you better save those for yourself. Hey.How 's it going? Listen, the offer you made the other day? The loan? Yeah. Yeah, it still stands.

You should drive alone. Maybe that way, you see anything by the side of the road that you like better than me, you can feel free to stop! Woman. Woman! Woman, what the hell is wrong with you?!

Perfect, because you 're gon na be laying away from me now, too. But, mai... when you walked into that hotel room, I knew you were meant for me. If I saw your real application, believe me, you would n't even make my top 10! You saidyou were a great cook you gave foot rubs.

Won again. Who 's the champion? You 're the champion. That 's right, I... am... the champion! You want a piece of this, boss?! No, no, I 'm good. Fraidy cat. I 'm worried about marin. I left a note on her door. She was n't home yet? She went up accokeek earlier. I thought she would be here by now. She 's up on a mountain? See you, " fear of failure "! Well... that was the last one. Look at that. Elmo 's completely covered in clouds. You ca n't even see the men anymore. My problems are so small. I thought it was heading west. Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody should be out in this. Exactly. Wow. Won again. Who wants some of this?! Your lady is no shrinking violet when it comesto gamesmanship. She 's more like an exploding daisy. Copy that. I could play with a blind fold on. What 's wrong? I lost! It 'S... just checkers. I know_i 'm depressed. I need my sad machine. Keep your head down, all right.Follow the trail. Cash! Marin! " She knew there were breadcrumbs that marked her way, but now she could n't find them. " Will she be okay? She 'll be okay. Cash! Marin! Jack! Jack! Hey! Follow me! Cash was with me. Where? I do n't know! You ca n't stay out here! Well, I 'm not leaving without him! Cash! See, baby, it 's okay. I know what would make you feel better, matty. A game of twister! You scare me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her. Bring it. Three hours and counting. Looks like we better start handing out free burgers. Well, why not? You 're being awfully generous these days. Hey.What was that about? Sara told me about the loan we gave her. It 's just for a lawyer. Her ex is trying to take custody of matty. I do n't care what it 's for. Then what? Look, I know I did n't make the kind of money that you made before we got married, but I thought we were partners. And partners discuss things like loans before they happen. Is this really about us sharing our money, or is this about something else? If you 're going give our money to your ex-girlfriend, it would be nice if you told your wife. Jack, I think this is where I lost him. Cash! We need to keep moving.It 's too dangerous. Hey! Cash! You 're okay! Yeah, you? Yeah, fine! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey, we need to keep moving! This way down is better! No, it 's north-facing! We need to go this way! I 've lived on this mountain! Yeah, and at this rate, you 're gon na die on it, too! Someone pick! Fine.We 'll go his way. Left foot, yellow. If you win, it 's only because your arms are at least three timesas long as mine. Spin! Right hand, blue. Whoo! Looks like I 'm the winner! Numero uno! Numero uno! You pushed me. Whoa. Sore loser, party of one. Annie, that 's enough. Enough? I 'm not stopping now. I 'm on a roll! No one wants to play with you. Yeah, ' cause I 'm beating the pants off of them! No, because you 're a mean, competitive - - rhymes with " mitch. " Excuse me? I could n't hold it in. That was - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah. You made me laugh. I brought your shoes. I thought you said you loved everything about me. Yes. So, I get competitive.That 's who I am. Okay, well, maybe some things we both may need to work on, like... maybe not yelling at little boys. In that case, I would like you to stop interrupting me and using the term " orifice " when you mean " office. " But you always laugh when I say, " I 'll call youat your orifice. " The first three times you said it, yes. Okay. That hurt. Does this make you not want to marry me? What? No. I want to marry you like crazy. I just do n't want to play checkers with you. Ever. Do n't do that again. Yeah, but I thought you - - yeah, I lied. Hey! Where 's jack? He 's right behind us. Hey. Hey, jack. Hey. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Hey, man, thanks for helping us out. Yeah. Yeah, you could have been killed out there. Yeah, I know that. Yeah, well, marin did n'T. You did a lousy job of protecting her. That 's ironic coming from you, jack. Now you do n't want to hurt her. Maybe you should leave her alone. Are n't you marrying someone else? That has nothing to do with this.Really? That 's the reason she was upon that mountain to begin with. If you want to blame someone, blame yourself. Break it up. Calm down, jack. Everything 's okay. * I did n't think so * Cash? Sorry, princess. I 'm sorry. Do n't worry about it. I got ta go get some ice for my hand. It must be nic ehaving two men fight over you. One would be nice. Ben, you mind if I use the stage for a minute? Be my guest. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, folks. I 'd like you to share a little song I 'm about to sing to my bride. A serenade to my number one, if you will. * Why do birds suddenly appear * * every time you are near? * * Just like me * * they long to be * * close to you * * On the daythat you were born * * the angels - - * Hey. Hey. What did he say to make you do that? Uh, he said that I was the reason you were up there. He 's partly right. I was trying to get some closure to us, I guess. On a mountain? It involved rocks. Did you get closure? Why do you care, jack? It 's, uh, hard for me, too, marin. I know it 's unfair of me to say that, but it 's true. We might not be together, but that does n't mean that everything we had instantly gets wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot there. There was. We 're gon na be okay. Yeah. Thanks. What, for punching him? For saying it was real. Storm 's over! * Yesterday, he said my eyes... * Sometimes, it 's not until a storm comes that things get unearthed. We get to see what 's underneath. The dark secrets and the truths that in the light of day we keep hidden. * I would n't feel this way, he said * * he said * * he said it 's crazy * for some, the truth will make them feel closer. For others, it will make them more alone. Hey, sara, take this for matty. He seemed to like it. But it 's for the baby. Um, I 'm not sure I want her to believe in fairy tales. *... And apologies * * he says it 's crazy how love stays with me * * yeah, you know * Pain will get uprooted... * I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's too late for a soliloquy * * way too late for dignity this time *... some pain still too deep to be seen by human eyes. But in time, as we replant ourselves, we will be thankful. Because, like the roots of a tree, it is what lies beneath that allows us to grow... together or apart. Apologies
