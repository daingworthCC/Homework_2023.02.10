Who here wants to see some fireworks? Uh, why are we stopping? Because I slipped Jimmy a five. You what? Come on, these are the best seats in the house. The best seats in the house. Oh! Happy Fourth of July! Whoa! That was pretty, was n't it? Yeah. Yeah. Mom, the trees. What, baby? The trees are moving. Why are you looking at the trees, baby? The fireworks. Look at the fireworks! That was a big one, was n't it? He said he was building something. That it was all for me. Building something... Is he talking about the flayed? He must be. So, he 's building an army, just like we thought. Yeah, but he 's not building this army to spread. He 's building it to stop Eleven. Last year, El closed the gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him off. Like, royally. And the Mind Flayer now knows that she 's the only thing that can stop him. But if she 's out of the way... Game over. He also said he was gon na kill all of you. Yeah, well, that 's nice. Do you guys hear that? It 's just the fireworks. Billy... When he told you this, it was here, in this room? He knows we 're here. Jesus, slow down! Yeah, what is this, like, the Indy 500? It 's the Indy 300. No, dingus, it 's 500! It 's 300! Let 's say a million. What is wrong with them? I do n't know. Dustin, watch out! Shit! Oh! You guys all right back there? They 're fine. Come on. We got ta go, now. Come on! Get out! Let 's go! Ow! We 're coming! Here goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you 're surfing! Surfing! Yeah! Whoa! They seem drunk. Why would they be drunk? I 'm a natural! Check it out! Whoop! Wipeout! He 's burning up. You 're burning up. One sec, one sec. Steve, Steve. God, no. Ow! His pupils are super dilated. Maybe he 's drugged. Ugh. Boop! Steve, are you drugged? How many times, Dad? I do n't do drugs. It 's only marijuana. This is n't funny, okay? I need to know what they did to you. Are you gon na die on us? Boop. We all die, my strange little child friend. It 's just a matter of how... and when. They 're gon na be looking for us up there, so I need you to tell me where you parked your car. Oh, can we make a pit stop at the food court? I would kill for a hot dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, food. Yes, you can have as much food as you want, but only if you tell me where your car is parked. Uh-oh. Uh-oh? The car 's off the board. What? They took the keys. The Russians, they took the keys. Like, forever ago. That 's a bummer, right? Oh! Oh, my God, that tastes so good. Ah! Steve, can you taste the air? I taste it! I taste it! Stop! Shit! Come on! Come on! Stop right there! Okay, okay, okay! Woo! Why are we running? Yeah. That 's good like that. Hey, get away from the windows. It 's close. Where 'd it go? Holy shit. El! El! Pull! Nancy, shoot it! Come on! Lucas! Pull! El! El, you okay? Go, go, go! Come on, come on, go! Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go! Go, come on! Go, go, go, go! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Get in. Right here. Drive! Drive! Whoa! Where are we going? Just trust me. All clear. Doc! What did I tell you?! Eighty-eight miles per hour! Come on. The temporal displacement occurred exactly 1:20... You two, sit. No, no, no! These seats are too close! Dude, these seats blow. Then do n't watch the movie. We wan na watch it. Then watch it! Shh! Shh! Sorry. Whatever you do, do n't... go... anywhere. Fine, Dad. The appropriate question is " When the hell are they? " You see, Einstein has just becomethe world 's first time traveler! Sorry. Sorry. I sent him... into the future! Okay, it 's official. I 'm never having kids. What are we doing here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oswald. Oswald was found in a theater and shot to death. A week later. The point is, his plan did n't work. Only because it was a setup. What? He was just a patsy. Tell me you 're joking. Shh! Shh! We need to get outta here. All right, you watchTweedledee and Tweedledum. Make sure they do n't go anywhere. Where are you going? To find us a ride. Look out! Doc... What 's happening? I have no idea. Are you telling me that you built a time machine... What 's he saying? He 's showing me the location of the key to turn off the machine. Sorry, " keys. " Two keys. Two-man rule. Two-man rule? Yeah, two men, two keys, like a... nuclear launch. But, uh, to retrieve the keys, there is a vault. And to open the vault, you need to enter Planck 's constant. Planck 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous number. All right, so we get the keys, and then we turn the machine off. That 's what he says. All right, well, that should n't be too hard. We can do this. Joyce, did you hear the part where he said the place was like an impenetrable fortress? Yeah, but there has to be a way in. Yeah, there is. Our military. Who are coming. Well, we do n't know that anymore because you yelled at them like it was a parent-teacher conference, and then you hung up on them, so we do n't know what the hell 's going on, because now we 're... Wait, wait, what are we do... Oh! Wait, that 's right! We 're on our way to rescue our children from the big, badFourth of July celebration! You know what, if you ca n't handle this, then just turn around and drop me off first. What are you gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will do anything if it gets me away from you! Children! Children! Children! This interminable bickering was amusing at first, but it 's getting very stale and we 've still got a long drive ahead of us. So, why do n't you two cut the horseshit and get to the part where you admit your sexual feelings for one another? Whoa! You are way off base, buddy! Oh, spare me, spare me, spare me! Yes, yes, he 's a brute. I know. Probably reminds you of a bad relationship, and, gosh, you 'd really like a nice man to settle down with, but, admit it, you 're real curious to know what he 's like in the sack. And you. Ha! Well, you 're just a big manbaby who 'd rather act tough than show his true feelings, because the last time you opened your heart, you got hurt. Owie. And now, rather than admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this mind-numbing and frankly boorish mating ritual. So, please, for my sake, either quit your bickering, or pull over, tear off those clothes, and get it over with already! What was that? I told them they should have sex. They have not had sex? No. Oh! Oh! Okay, get her down. Okay. Lemme see. Oh, shit. What... What... Hey, what are you doing? I 'm cleaning the wound. No, first, we need to stop the bleeding, then clean, then disinfect, then bandage. I skateboard. Trust me. Mike, hold this. Keep the pressure on it, nice and firm, okay? We 're gon na need water, soap. Yeah, okay. All right. Does any of this help? No. Go get me a washcloth and a bowl. A bowl? Lucas. Go. Okay. What did that thing look like to you? Like that thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot bigger. Like, Tom and Bruce, they merged to become one, right? And... And Driscoll kept saying how she needed to go back to the source... Wait, you think Driscoll 's in there? Maybe. And... And... And maybe Heather and Janet, too, and God knows who else. I do n't know how we 're gon na kill this thing, but if we do... We kill all the flayed. And... we end this. Maybe. All I know is... we need El. Bowl... Bowl... Bowl... Why would n't it be with the cereal? I do n't know. What else do you use a bowl for? I... I do n't know. Oh, shit. Satan 's Baby. You ever shot one of these suckers? No. Is it sweet? That 's an understatement. That does n't look like a bowl. Nah, it 's way better. There is a reason this warning label says " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150 grains of black powder. AKA gunpowder. Strap two of these together, and it 's bigger than an M-80. Five of them, we 've got ourselves a stick of dynamite. You wan na kill that thing with fireworks? Do you have a better idea? Uh, yeah. Eleven. Against that thing? She 's gon na need some backup. Oh, my God. Hold this. Does that hurt? Uh, not bad. You 're gon na have an awesome scar. You 'll look even more badass. Bitchin '. Yeah, bitchin '. El... Yeah? I 've been meaning to tell you something. It 's just, being broken up, it 's been hard. And... I like that you and Max are friends now. It 's just, I was jealous at first, and... and angry. And that 's why I said all that stupid stuff. And it 's like I wanted you all to myself. And now I realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like... I 'm sorry. I just, like, I 've never felt like this, you know, with anyone before... and... You know, they do say it makes you crazy. What makes you crazy? You never... You never heard that term... You know, like the phrase, like... " blank makes you crazy, " like the word... " Girlfriends "? No, no, no, no, not... not girlfriends. " Boyfriends. " No! No, no, not boyfriends either. It 's like... It 's like a feeling or... A feeling... Yeah, like something... Like, old people say it to each other sometimes. Old people? Yeah. What I wan na say is... that I just... I know that I... I repeat... this is a code red! Dustin? Mike? Dustin! Mike! Oh, my God, you have to listen. I know I 've been MIA, and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I mean, I actually was mad, but it 's also becauseI was trapped underground in a secret Russian base. Dustin, you 're going way too fast. I ca n't understand you. I know that sounds insane, but the Russians have infiltrated Hawkins! The goddamn Russians! And now... they 're using... to open the gate. Dustin, you 're... you 're breaking up. And now they 're after us and we do n't have a way out of here, so I need you to come and get us. Can Nancy drive? Dustin, you 're cutting out. Mike? Dustin, you there? Mike? Mike, do you copy? Dustin... Shit! Not now. Please, not now. Mike! Dustin! Mike! What is it? Do you have any batteries? Double-A? Why would I have batteries? I always carry batteries. Then what 's the problem? I need eight. Eight? Shit. Guess we 'll have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Where... are they? That 's amazing. So, like, I was n't totally focused in there or anything, but... I 'm pretty sure... that mom was trying to bang her son. Wait, wait, the hot chick was Alex P. Keaton 's mom? Yeah, I 'm pretty sure. But they 're the same age. No, but he went back in time. Then why is it called Back to the Future? He has to go back to the future because he 's in the past. So, the future is actually the present, which is his time. Wh... What? No, no, it 's my turn. You 've had enough. Wow. Hey, Robin. You got ta check this out. Check this... This... The ceiling, it 's beautiful. Oh, wow. Oh. Stay here, go over the plans with Smirnoff. I can help look. No, you 'll scare the children. Jim, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! You hear me? Stay put! You know, say what you will about Kline, he certainly knows how to throw a party. I 'm sorry about him, by the way. Who, Larry? No, Murray. He 's a sick individual who likes to get under people 's skin. So, let 's not let him, you know, get under our skin. I 'm not, I have n't. I just, you seem a little more quiet than usual. I just... I just wan na find the kids. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I 'll give it my best shot. You won yourself a bear! Thank you. Here you go. Mayor Kline! One more, one more. Big smile. There we go. Watch it! Happy Fourth, dick. Come on, come on, come on! Pick up, pick up, pick up, you commie bastards! Quiet. Oh, sorry. How do you even drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's like Carpenter 's The Thing. The original is a classic, no question about it. But the remake... Sweeter, bolder... better. You 're insane. So, you prefer the original Thing? What? No, I 'm not talking about The Thing, I 'm talking about New Coke. It 's the same concept, dude. Uh, actually, it 's not the same concept. It is the same concept. No, it 's not. Yes, it is. Hey. Sorry. Sorry. Did you... find him? The movies? Dustin 's so freaked out about the gate, he decides to go watch a movie? Yeah, makes total sense. You 're positive he said " gate " and not " great "? Yeah, like, " This movie I 'm watching is great. " Sounded like " gate. " Which would explain how the Mind Flayer 's still alive. Yeah, we just have to shut it again. Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucas ' fireworks. Keep mocking my plan, Max. Keep mocking it. I wan na hear you say it again, because you keep doubting me. You keep doubting me! Ridiculous. Will? We 're gon na prove ' em wrong, right? The ceiling stopped spinning for me. Is it still spinning for you? Holy shit. No. You think we puked it all up? Maybe. Ask me something. Interrogate me. Okay. Interrogate you. Sure. Um... When was the last time you, uh, peed your pants? Today. What? When the Russian doctor took out the bone saw. Oh, my God. It was just a little bit, though. Yeah, it 's definitely still in her system. Oh... All right, my turn. Okay. Hit me. Have you... ever been in love? Yep. Nancy Wheeler. First semester, senior year. Oh, my God. She 's such a priss. Hm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love with Nancy? No. Why not? I think it 's because I found someone who 's a little bit better for me. It 's crazy. Ever since Dustin got home, he 's been saying, " You know, you got ta find your Suzie. You got ta find your Suzie. " Wait, who 's Suzie? It 's some girl from camp, I guess his girlfriend. To be honest with you, I 'm not 100% sure she 's even real. But that 's not... that 's not really the point. That does n't matter. The point is, this girl, you know, the one that I like, it 's somebody that I... did n't even talk to in school. And I do n't even know why. Maybe ' cause Tommy H. would 've made fun of me or... I would n't be... prom king. It 's stupid. I mean, Dustin 's right, it 's all just a bunch of bullshit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should 've been hanging out with this girl the whole time. First of all, she 's hilarious. She 's so funny. I feel like, this summer, I have laughed harder than I have laughed... in a really long time. And she 's smart. Way smarter than me. You know, she can crack, like, top secret Russian codes and... You know? She 's honestly unlike anyoneI 've ever even met before. Robin? Robin, did you just OD in there? No. I... am still alive. The floor 's disgusting. Yeah, well, I already got a bunch of blood and puke on my shirt, so... What do you think? About? This girl. She sounds awesome. She is awesome. And what about the guy? I think he 's on drugs, and he 's not thinking straight. Really? ' Cause I think he 's thinking a lot more clearly than usual. He 's not. Look... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did know her, like... like really know her, I do n't think he 'd even want to be her friend. No, that 's not true. No way is that true. Listen to me, Steve. It 's shocked me to my core, but I like you. I really like you. But I 'm not like your other friends. And I 'm not like Nancy Wheeler. Robin, that 's exactly why I like you. Do you remember what I said about Click 's class? About me being jealous and, like, obsessed? Yeah. It is n't because I had a crush on you. It 's because... she would n't stop staring at you. Mrs. Click? Tammy Thompson. I wanted her to look at me. But... she could n't pull her eyes away from you and your stupid hair. And I did n't understand, because you would get bagel crumbs all over the floor. And you asked dumb questions. And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even like her and... I would go home... and just scream into my pillow. But Tammy Thompson 's a girl. Steve. Yeah? Oh. Oh. Holy shit. Yeah. Holy shit. Steve... did you OD over there? No, I just, uh... just thinking. Okay. I mean, yeah. Tammy Thompson, you know, she 's cute and all, but... I mean, she 's a total dud. She is not. Yes, she is. She wants to be, like, a singer. She wants to move to, like, Nashville and shit. She has dreams. She ca n't even hold a tune. She 's practically tone-deaf. Have you heard her? All the time.( m) You see me now tonight( m) Shut up.( m) You see me...( m) She does not sound like that. She sounds exactly... That 's a great impersonation of her. She does not. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muppet. She sounds like a Muppet giving birth.( m) And if you could hold me tight( m)( m) We 'll be holding on forever( m) Exactly. I know! Okay. What the hell? And why all this? If I just turn the keys, it 's like turning off a car. But then the car still works, does it not? Yes. And do you want the car to still work or do you want it to explode? I want the car to explode. Good. Then do this. Just make sure you are nowhere near it when it does. It is not pretty. Turns people into dust. And then... It 's over. And I become an American citizen and join in the fun, yes? Who said you had to be an American to join the fun? It does n't get more American than this, my friend. Fatty foods, ugly decadence, rigged games... Fifteen tickets, please. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not look rigged. That 's just it, my dear Alexei. They have been designed to present the illusion of fairness! But it 's all a scam, a trick, to put your money in the rich man 's pocket. That, my dear friend, is... America. But, hey... knock yourself out. Where are you going? To get us the closest thing to foodI can find. Hey. Hey. Karen. Step right up!... feel the wind push you back and it 's gon na... Hold on. Do we have seat belts? Hey, Karen. Joyce! Oh, my gosh! How funny to see you here! Where are the kids? I... I have n't seen them. I do n't think they 're here yet. You three, up against the wall! No, where are they? Oh, my gosh, I can hardly keep track these days. Uh, they were at, uh... Dustin 's, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know how it is. Summer! Probably getting into some kinda trouble. Last warning, you two. Up against the wall! Hold the ride! On your life, Magnum. Woo! Here we go! Holy smokes! Holy smokes! Roads? Where we 're going, we do n't need roads. And... blend. It is so good! Well, shit, that worked. Course it worked. We just have to get on the bus with the rest of these plebes, and home sweet home, here we come. Uh, Dustin? What? Yeah, we might not wan na go to your house. Why? Well, I might 've told them your full name. What is wrong with you? Dude, I was drugged. So? So? So, you resist. You tough it out. You tough it out like a man. Oh, yeah, it 's easy for you to say. Guys? Sorry for the inconvenience. Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shit. Okay. Come on, let 's go, let 's go. That 's three green! And here 's dart number four! One more for the big prize! You can do it, mister! We have a winner! Step right up, ladies and gentlemen! Get your tickets right here! Murray! Look! It 's not rigged! Ah! It 's not rigged. Traitor. Alexei! Alexei! Oh, no. Oh, my God. Let 's go. Easy. Keep pressure on it. I 'll get you help. I 'll get help. Jim... Jim. Jim! They got Alexei, Jim! Jim! Alexei!

Do you dare enter the cave of horrors? You never know what you might find around the corner. Do n't show your fear in the presence of the tiger. Or you may never escape this cave alive. Alexei! Oh, my God. I... I just left for a minute... for a corn dog. A stupid corn dog. Oh, God. Oh, no. Vasilev, are you there? Vasilev? Answer! What are you doing? Hey! Larry. Joyce. Ooh! Yeah, lady! Hey. Comrade! Get off me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hit it. Hit it! Go! Go! Alexei? On the lower level... Hey, translate. We 've found the children. They are still in the mall. Lower level. Keep all entrances locked down. I repeat... Keep all entrances locked down. Everyone, get over here. I found them. What the hell? You flung that thing like a Hot Wheel! Lucas? What are you doing here? Ask them. It 's their fault. True, yeah. Totally true. It 's absolutely our fault. I do n't understand what happened to that car. El has superpowers. I 'm sorry? Superpowers. She threw it with her mind. C'm on, catch up. That 's El? Who 's El? I 'm sorry, who are you? I 'm Robin. I work with Steve. She cracked the top secret code. Yeah, which is how we found out about the Russians. Russians? Wait, what Russians? The Russians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you talking about? Did n't you hear our code red? Yeah. Could n't understand what you were saying. Goddamn low battery. How many times do I have to tell you with the low battery? Well, everything worked out, did n't it? Worked out? We almost died. Yeah, but we did n't, did we? It was pretty damn close. Okay, Russians? As in, they 're working for the Russian government? What are you not comprehending? Am I not speaking English? We have a full-blown Red Dawn situation. So this has nothing to do with the gate? It has everything to do with the gate... Whoa, whoa, whoa. El! El! What 's wrong with her? What 's wrong? My leg. My leg. Her leg, her leg. Okay. Get that off. Okay. El! El! El! El, are you okay? El! El! El
