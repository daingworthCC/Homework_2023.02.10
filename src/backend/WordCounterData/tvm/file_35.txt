POTTER : Are you running a business or a charity ward? Not with my money. BAILEY : What makes you so hard-skuIIed? You have no family, no children. You ca n't begin to spend all your money. POTTER : So I should give it to miserable failures... like you and your idiot brother? GEORGE : He 's not a failure! You ca n't say that about my father.

ANNIE : If you touch me, I'II hit you with this broom! HARRY : I 'm in love with you. There 's a moon out tonight. GEORGE : Boy, my last meal in the old bailey boarding house. MA : My blood pressure. Can I have the car? I 'm taking over some plates. MA : What plates? I 'm chairman of the eats committee. We only need a couple dozen. MA : No, you do n't, Harry, not my best HaviIand. GEORGE : Oh, Iet him have the plates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip. uncle billy and I will miss you. GEORGE : What 's the matter? You look tired. POP : I had another tussle with Potter. I thought when I put him on the board of directors... he 'd ease up on us. GEORGE : What 's eating that money-grubbing buzzard? GEORGE : He 's a sick man - - frustrated, sick in his mind... sick in his soul, if he has one. He hates everybody that has anything he ca n't have. Hates us mostly, I guess. HARRY : Gangway. Gangway. So long, Pop. GEORGE : You got a match? HARRY : Very funny. MA : Put those in the car. I'II get your tie. HARRY : OK, Mom. You coming later, George? GEORGE : And be bored to death? HARRY : could n't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls. POP : No gin tonight, son. HARRY : Oh, Pop, just a little? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANNIE : Boys and girls and music. Why do they need gin? GEORGE : I act like that when I graduated from high school? POP : Pretty much. I wish we could send Harry to college with you. Mother and I talked it over. GEORGE : We have that figured out. Harry will take my job at the building and Loan... work there for four years, then he'll go. POP : Pretty young for that job. GEORGE : No younger than I was. POP : You were born older, George. GEORGE : How 's that? POP : You were born older. I suppose you 've decided what you want to do... when you get out of college. GEORGE : build things, design buildings, plan modern cities. AII that stuff I 've talked about. POP : still after that first million before 30? GEORGE : I'II settle for half that in cash. POP : Of course it 's just a hope... but you would n't consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you? GEORGE : well, I... Annie, why do n't you draw up a chair? Then you could hear everything that 's going on. ANNIE : I would if I thought I 'd hear anything worthwhile. GEORGE : You would, huh? POP : I know it 's soon to talk about it. GEORGE : Now, Pop, I could n't. I could n't face being cooped up for the rest of my Iife... in a shabby little office. I 'm sorry, Pop. I did n't mean that. It 's this business of nickels and dimes.... and spending your life trying to save 3 cents on pipe. I 'd go crazy. I want to do something big and important. George, I feel that in a small way... we 're doing something important - - satisfying a fundamental urge. It 's deep in the race for a man... to want his own roof, walls, and fireplace. We 're helping him get those things... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I know that. I wish I felt that, uh... I 've been hoarding pennies like a miser here in order to -- Most of my friends have already finished college. I just feel like if I did n't get away, I 'd bust! POP : Yes, you 're right, son. GEORGE : You see what I mean, Pop? POP : This town is no place for any man... unless he 's willing to crawl to Potter. You 've got talent, son. I 've seen it. You get yourself an education and get out of here. Pop, you want a shock? I think you 're a great guy. Did you hear that, Annie? I heard it. It 's about time one of you Iunkheads said it. I 'm going to miss old Annie. Pop, I think I'II get dressed and go over to Harry 's party. POP : Have a good time, son. GEORGE : Excuse me. There you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know my brother George. I 'm going to put him through college. SAM : Hee-haw! GEORGE : Sam Wainwright. How are you? When did you get here? SAM : This afternoon. I thought I 'd give the kids a treat. GEORGE : old college graduate now. SAM : old Joe college Wainwright they call me. Freshman, looks like you'II make it after all. Harry, you 're the guy I want to see. Coach has heard all about you. He 's followed every game. He wants me to find out if you 're coming along. HARRY : I got to make some dough first. SAM : Make it fast. We need great ends like you... not broken-down old guys like him. Hee-haw! PARTRIDGE : George, welcome back. GEORGE : Mr. Partridge, how are you? PARTRIDGE : Putting a pool under this floor was a great idea. Saved us another building. Harry, Sam, have lots of fun. Lots of pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1/3 of my dance card left. - hello, violet. - hello. What am I bid? MARTY : George. GEORGE : Marty! well, it 's old home week. MARTY : Sam, Harry, good to see you.

I feel funny enough with all these kids. MARTY : Be a sport. Dance with her one time. Hey, sis! GEORGE : Do n't be long, Marty. I 'm not being a wet nurse to a -- BOY : Some guy came up and tripped me. If not for that, that race would have been a cinch. I tried to find out later who it was... but I could n't find out. Nobody would ever tell you whoever it was. MARTY : You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seeing you. GEORGE : well, well, well. BOY : Now to get back to my story, see...

You look at me as if you did n't know me. well, I do n't. You 've passed me on the street almost every day. Me? No. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. Oh, yes! Oh, yes! The big charleston contest! [Crowd_cheers] HARRY : The prize - - a genuine loving cup. Those not tapped by the judges will remain on the floor. Let 's go! [Band_plays] GEORGE : I 'm not very good at this. MARY : Neither am I. OK. What can we lose? Hey, you 're wonderful. What 's the matter, othello? jealous? Did you know there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button behind you causes this floor to open up? Did you further know that George bailey... is dancing right over that crack? I 've got the key.

GEORGE : Oh, hot dog. Just like an organ. I told Harry I thought I 'd be bored. You should have seen that locker room. I had to knock down three people to get this stuff. Let me hold that wet dress. MARY : Do I Iook as funny as you do? GEORGE : I 'm not the football type. You look wonderful! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were the prettiest girl in town. well, why do n't you say it? GEORGE : Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway? MARY : Eighteen. Eighteen? only last year you were 17. Too young or too old? Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. You look a little older without your clothes on. I mean, without a dress you look older. I mean younger. You Iook - - you just -- Uh-oh! Oh, I 'm on the thing here. MARY : Sir, my train, please. GEORGE : A pox upon me for a clumsy Iout. Your... your caboose, milady. - You may kiss my hand. - Mmm. GEORGE : Hey. Hey, Mary. As I was Iumberin ' down the street... Down the street, down the street... GEORGE : I'II throw a rock at the old GranviIIe house. MARY : Do n't. I Iove that old house. GEORGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. MARY : Do n't. It 's full of romance, that old place. I 'd Iike to live in it. GEORGE : In that place? I would n't live in it as a ghost. Watch this. Right in the second floor, there. See? [Crash] What did you wish, George? Not just one wish - - a whole hatful. I know what I 'm going to do... tomorrow and the next day and next year. I 'm shaking the dust of this crummy town off my feet... and I 'm going to see the world! italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the coliseum. Then I'II go to college and see what they know. Then I 'm gon na build things. I'II build airfields and skyscrapers 100 stories high. I'II build bridges a mile long. You going to throw a rock? [Crash] Hey, that 's pretty good. What did you wish, Mary? buffalo gals, ca n't you come out tonight? Ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight? buffalo gals, ca n't you come out tonight... And... Dance by the light of da moon? What did you wish when you threw that rock? MARY : No. If I told you, it might not come true. What is it you want? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say the word, and I'II Iasso it and pull it down. That 's a pretty good idea. I'II give you the moon. I'II take it. Then what? Then you could swallow it, and it would all dissolve... and the moonbeams would shoot out of your fingers and toes... and the ends of your hair. Am I talking too much? Yes! - Why do n't you kiss her? - How 's that? Why do n't you kiss her instead of talking her to death? You want me to kiss her? Aw, youth is wasted on the wrong people. Hey, hold on, mister. Come on back out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your head. [Mary_squeaIs] Mary? [whistles] OK, I give up. Where are you? Over here in the hydrangea bushes. Here you are. Catch. Wait a minute. What am I doing? This is a very interesting situation. MARY : please give me my robe. GEORGE : A man does n't get in a situation like this every day. MARY : I 'd Iike to have my robe. GEORGE : Not in Bedford falls, anyway. MARY : Ouch! Oh! GEORGE : Gesundheit. This requires some thought. MARY : George bailey, give me my robe. GEORGE : I 've read about things like this. MARY : Shame on you! I 'm going to tell your mother. GEORGE : My mother 's way up on the corner there. MARY : I'II call the police. GEORGE : They 're way downtown. They 'd be on my side, too. MARY : I 'm going to scream! GEORGE : Maybe I could sell tickets. Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get this robe - - I 've got it. I'II make a deal with you, Mary. BILLY : George! George! BILLY : George, come on home! Quick! Your father 's had a stroke. GEORGE : What? Mary, I 'm sorry. I 've got to go. Did you get a doctor? BILLY : campbell 's there now. CAMPBELL : That 's all, George. I know you 're anxious to make a train. GEORGE : I have a taxi waiting downstairs. CAMPBELL : You know, George gave up his Europe trip... to help straighten things out these past few months. Good luck to you at school. And now, the real purpose of this meeting - - to appoint a successor to Peter bailey. POTTER : I 'd Iike to get to my real purpose -- - Wait -- - For what? This institution is not necessary to this town. Therefore, I make a motion to dissolve this institution... and give its assets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty -- George, did you hear what that buzzard -- MAN : It 's too soon after Peter bailey 's death... to talk about chIoroforming the building and Loan. SECOND MAN : Peter bailey died three months ago. I second Mr. Potter 's motion. CAMPBELL : Very well. In that case... I'II ask the two executive officers to withdraw. The whole board wishes to express its deep sorrow... at the passing of Peter bailey. It was his faith and devotion... that are responsible for this organization. POTTER : I'II go further than that. To the public, Peter bailey was the building and Loan. BILLY : That 's fine, coming from you. You probably drove him to his grave! POTTER : Peter bailey was not a businessman. That 's what killed him. Oh, I do n't mean any disrespect to him. He was a man of high ideals... so-caIIed. But ideals without common sense can ruin this town. Now, you take this Ioan here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day on his brains... in his taxi, you know. I happen to know the bank turned down this Ioan. But he comes here... and we 're building him a house worth $5,000. Why? GEORGE : I handled that, Mr. Potter. You have all the papers there. I can vouch for his character. - A friend of yours? - Yes, sir. POTTER : If you shoot pool with some employee here... you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble... instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers... like Peter bailey stir them up and fill their heads... with a Iot of impossible ideas. Now, I say -- GEORGE : Just a minute. hold on, Mr. Potter. You 're right when you say my father was no businessman. Why he started this penny-ante building and Loan... I'II never know... but nobody can say anything against his character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billy started this thing... he never once thought of himself. He did n't save enough money for Harry or me to go to school... but he did help a few people get out of your slums. What 's wrong with that? You 're all businessmen here. Does n't it make them better citizens and customers? You said that they had to wait and save their money... before they even thought of a decent home. Wait until their children grow up and leave them? Do you know how long it takes a working man to save $5,000? Just remember that this rabble you 're talking about - - they do most of the working, paying, living, and dying... in this community. Is it too much to work, pay, live, and die... in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? My father did n't think so. people were human beings to him, but to you... a warped, frustrated old man, they 're cattle. In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever be. I 'm not interested in your book. I 'm talking about the building and Loan. You 're talking about something you ca n't get your fingers on... and it 's galling you. I know. well, I 've said too much. You 're the board. You do what you want. Just one thing more. This town needs this measly institution... if only to have someplace where people can come... without crawling to Potter. Come on. [Door_closes] sentimental hogwash. I want my motion acted on. [Arguing] BILLY : Boy, oh, boy, George. You shut his big mouth. EUSTACE : What happened? We heard yelling. BILLY : We 're being voted out of business after 25 years. Easy come, easy go. ERNIE : You want me to hang around, George? GEORGE : Yeah. I'II be right down. BILLY : You'II miss your train. Go on. GEORGE : What 's going on in there? BILLY : They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get another job. I 'm only 55. TILLY : Fifty-six. BILLY : Go on. You do n't want to miss college, do you? CAMPBELL : George! George! They voted Potter down. They want to keep it going. They 've got only one condition... and that 's the best part of it - - they 've appointed George as executive secretary. GEORGE : But uncle BiIIy -- CAMPBELL : You can keep him on. As secretary, you can hire anyone. GEORGE : Let 's get this straight. I 'm leaving. I 'm going to school. This is my last chance. uncle billy, he 's your man. CAMPBELL : George, they'II vote with Potter otherwise. CLARENCE : I know. He did n't go. JOSEPH : That 's right. Not only that... but he gave his school money to his brother Harry... and sent him to college. Harry became a football star. Made second team aII-American. CLARENCE : Yeah, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years older... waiting for Harry to come back... and take over the building and Loan.

GEORGE : There 's the professor now. old professor Phi Beta Kappa, aII-American bailey. HARRY : uncle billy, you have n't changed. BILLY : Nobody ever changes here.

RUTH : Ruth Dakin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wired you I had a surprise. Here she is. Meet the wife. BILLY : What do you know? A wife! GEORGE : How do you do? congratulations. What am I doing? congratulations! BILLY : Goodness, Harry! GEORGE : They 're married! Why do n't you tell somebody? BILLY : Mrs. bailey, I ca n't wait to see -- Are you really married? GEORGE : What 's a pretty girl like you doing... marrying this two-headed brother of mine? RUTH : I'II tell you. It 's purely mercenary. My father offered him a job. BILLY : He got you and a job? Harry 's cup runneth over. HARRY : About that job - - I never said I 'd take it. You 've been holding the bag here for four years. I wo n't let you down, George. I forgot the bags. I'II be right back. BILLY : It was a surprise to me. This is the new Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RUTH : Oh, of course, I 've heard him speak of you. BILLY : And I want to tell you... we 're going to give the biggest party... this town ever saw. GEORGE : Harry will be right here. RUTH : Here, have some popcorn. George, George, George - - that 's all Harry ever talks about. GEORGE : Ruth, this... What about this job? RUTH : My father owns a glass factory in buffalo. He wants to get Harry started in the research business. GEORGE : Is it a good job? RUTH : Very. Not much money, but a good future. Harry 's a genius at research. My father just fell in love with him. GEORGE : You did, too, huh? PHOTOGRAPHER : hold it! hold it! That 's it! BILLY : Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy! I feel so good, I could spit in Potter 's eye. I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say? Maybe I 'd better go home. Where 's my hat? Where 's my hat? Oh. Thank you, George. - Which is mine? - The middle one. Thank you, George. Now, look... if you'II point me in the right direction -- would you do that, George? old building and Loan pal, huh? GEORGE : You turn this way and right straight down. My wild Irish rose... [Crash] I 'm all right! I 'm all right! The sweetest flower that grows... [Train_whistle_blows] Oh, hello, Ma. That 's for nothing. How do you Iike her? GEORGE : She 's swell. MA : Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes. GEORGE : Keep him out of Bedford falls, anyway. MA : Did you know Mary Hatch is back from school? - Came back three days ago. - Mm-hmm. - Nice girl, Mary. - Mm-hmm. MA : The kind that'll help you find the answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Can you give me one good reason why you should n't call on Mary? Sure. Sam Wainwright. Sam 's crazy about Mary. MA : She 's not crazy about him. GEORGE : Did she discuss it with you? - No. - Then how do you know? I 've got eyes, have n't I? She lights up like a firefly whenever you 're around. Besides, Sam Wainwright 's away in New York... and you 're here in Bedford falls. GEORGE : And all 's fair in love and war. MA : I do n't know about war. [Laughs] Mother of mine, I can see right through you... right to your back collar button. - Trying to get rid of me? Mm-hmm. GEORGE : well, here 's your hat. What 's your hurry? AII right, old building and Loan pal... I think I'II go find a girl... and do a little passionate necking.

Georgie, do n't you ever get tired... of just reading about things? Yes. What are you doing tonight? Not a thing. Are you game? Let 's make a night of it. VIOLET : What'II we do? Let 's go to the fields, take off our shoes... and walk through the grass. Huh? We can go up to the falls. It 's beautiful in the moonlight. There 's a green pool up there, and we can swim in it. Then we can climb Mount Bedford... and watch the sun rise against the peaks. we'll stay up there the whole night. Everyone will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the grass barefoot? [Laughter] Why, it 's 10 miles up to Mount Bedford. GEORGE : OK. Just forget about the whole thing. MARY : What are you doing, picketing? hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by. Yes, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind? - How 's that? - Have you made up your mind? - About what? - About coming in. Your mother phoned and said you were coming to visit. My mother just called? How did she know? - Did n't you tell her? - I did n't tell anybody. I went for a walk and happened to be passing by. What do you -- Went for a walk, that 's all. - I'II be downstairs, mother. - AII right, dear. [buffalo_gals_plays] well, are you coming in or are n't you? well, I'II come in for a minute. But I - - I... I did n't tell anybody I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When did you get back? Tuesday. Where did you get that dress? Do you Iike it? It 's all right. GEORGE : I thought you 'd go back to New York... like Sam and Angie and the rest of them. I worked there a couple of vacations, but I do n't know. I guess I was homesick. Homesick? For Bedford falls? Yes, and my family and... Oh, everything. would you Iike to sit down? GEORGE : AII right. For a minute. I still ca n't understand it. I did n't tell anybody I was coming here. would you rather leave? GEORGE : No. I do n't want to be rude. well, then, sit down. GEORGE : What 's that? Some joke, huh? well... I see it still smells like pine needles around here. MARY : Thank you. And dance by the...

Just marriage in general... you 're not enthusiastic about? Marriage is all right for Harry and Marty and Sam and you. Mary? Mary! Who 's down there with you? It 's George bailey, Mother. MOTHER : George bailey! What 's he want? I do n't know. What do you want? Me? Not a thing. I - - I just came in to get warm. He 's making violent love to me, Mother. MOTHER : tell him to go home and do n't you leave the house! Sam Wainwright promised to call you from New York. What 's your mother mean? I did n't come here to -- MARY : What did you come here for, then? GEORGE : I do n't know. You tell me.

Can you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know. Why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? tell your father he can get that for a song... and all the labor he wants, too. half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down. SAM : Is that so? I'II tell him. Hey, that sounds great! I knew you 'd come through. Now, here 's the point -- Mary, you 're in on this, too. Have you got any money? GEORGE : Money? Yeah. well, a little. SAM : I want you to put every cent into our stock. And George, I may have a job for you. That is, unless you 're still married... to that broken-down building and Loan. This is the biggest thing since radio... and I 'm letting you in on the ground floor. Oh, Mary... Mary! MARY : I-I 'm here. SAM : will you tell that guy... I 'm giving him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance of a lifetime! He says it 's the chance of a lifetime. Now, you listen to me. I do n't want any plastics, I do n't want ground floors... and I do n't want to get married, ever, to anyone. You understand that? I want to do what I want to do... and you 're... and you 're... Oh, Mary, Mary. George, George, George. Oh, Mary. Oh! Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Mary... Here they come! [The_Wedding_March_plays] VIOLET : Good-bye! Have a wonderful time!

The highest hotels, the oldest champagne... the richest caviar, the hottest music... and the prettiest wife. ERNIE : Rrrow! That does it. Then what? GEORGE : Then what, honey? MARY : After that, who cares? GEORGE : Rrrow! That does it. Come here. ERNIE : There 's something funny going on at the bank. I 've never really seen one... but that 's got all the earmarks of a run. MAN : Ernie, if you got money in the bank, you better hurry. MARY : George, Iet 's not stop. Let 's go. GEORGE : Just a minute, dear. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not stop. GEORGE : I'II be back in a minute. GEORGE : hello, everybody. Mrs. Thompson, how are you? charlie, what 's the matter here? Ca n't you get in? [Awk_awk_awk] What is this, uncle billy, a holiday? George. GEORGE : Come on in, everybody. That 's right. Just come on in. [Awk] Look out. Why do n't you all sit down? There are a Iot of seats over there. Just make yourselves at home. [Awk_awk] BILLY : Can I see you a minute? GEORGE : Why did n't you call me? BILLY : I did, but you 'd left. This is a pickle! GEORGE : What happened? How 'd it start? - The bank called our Ioan. - When? An hour ago. I handed over all our cash... and still it was less than we owe. Then I got scared and closed the doors. [telephone_rings] I -- GEORGE : The whole town 's gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Potter. GEORGE : hello? POTTER : There is a rumor that you 've closed your doors. Is that true? Oh, well, I 'm very glad to hear that. Are you all right? Do you need any police? police? What for? Mobs get pretty ugly sometimes. George, I am going aII-out to help in this crisis. I have just guaranteed the banks... sufficient funds to meet their needs. They will close up for a week and then reopen. GEORGE : He just took over the bank. POTTER : I may lose a fortune... but I am willing to guarantee your people, too. Just tell them to bring their shares over here... and I will pay 50 cents on the dollar. You never miss a trick, do you, Potter? well, you'II miss this one. If you close your doors before 6 p.m.... you will never reopen. [click] BILLY : George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one off now. GEORGE : Now... just remember that this thing is n't as black as it appears. [Sirens] GEORGE : I have some news for you, folks. I just talked to Potter... and he 's guaranteed cash payments for the bank. The bank will reopen next week. ED : But, George, I got my money here. CHARLIE : Did he guarantee this place? GEORGE : No, charlie. We do n't need Potter over here. CHARLIE : Then I'II take mine now. GEORGE : No, but you 're -- You 're thinking of this place all wrong... as if I had the money back in a safe. The money 's not here. Your money 's in Joe 's house and in the Kennedy house... and Mrs. MackIin 's house and a hundred others. You 're lending them the money to build... and they'II pay it back as best they can. Are you going to foreclose on them? TOM : I got $242 in here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GEORGE : OK, Tom, all right. You sign this. You'II get your money in 60 days. TOM : 60 days? GEORGE : That 's what you agreed when you bought your shares. - Tom, did you get your money? - No. RANDALL : Potter pays 50 cents on the dollar for every share. - 50 cents? - Cash. TOM : well, what do you say? GEORGE : You have to stick to your original agreement. Give us 60 days. - OK, randall. - Are you going to Potter 's? TOM : Better to get half than nothing. GEORGE : Tom! Tom! randall! Wait. Now, listen to me. I beg of you not to do this. If Potter gets ahold of this building and Loan... there'II never be another decent house built in this town. He 's got charge of the bank... the bus line, the department stores... and now he 's after us. Why? Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why. He wants to keep you living in his slums... and paying the kind of rent he decides. Joe, you had one of Potter 's houses. Have you forgotten what he charged you for that shack? Ed, last year when you could n't make your payments... you did n't lose your house. You think Potter would 've let you keep it? Ca n't you understand what 's happening here? Do n't you see what 's happening? Potter is n't selling, Potter 's buying! And why? Because we 're panicky, and he 's not. He 's picking up some bargain. We can get through this thing all right. We 've got to stick together, though. We 've got to have faith in each other. WOMAN : But my husband has n't worked in over a year. SECOND WOMAN : How will I Iive until the bank opens? - I got doctor bills to pay. - I need cash! MARY : How much do you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will tide us over till the bank reopens.

That 's a Ioan. - AII right, Ed. - I got $300 here. What will it take until the bank opens? ED : well, I suppose $20. GEORGE : Twenty dollars. Now you 're talking. Thanks, Ed. Mrs. Thompson, how much do you want? MRS. THOMPSON : But it 's your own money. GEORGE : Never mind. How much do you want? MRS. THOMPSON : $20, and I'II sign the paper. GEORGE : You do n't have to sign anything. I know you. Pay it when you can. AII right. Miss Davis? could I have 17.50? GEORGE : bless your heart. Of course you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : We 're going to make it. They'II never close us up today! GEORGE : Five, four... three, two... one... bingo! We made it! close the door, Eustace! We 've still got 2 bucks left. Let 's have some of that. Let 's celebrate! Get some glasses, TiIIy. We 're a couple of financial wizards. BILLY : Those RockefeIIers! GEORGE : Get a tray for these two important simoIeons. BILLY : we'll save ' em for seed. A toast! GEORGE : A toast to Mama dollar and Papa dollar... and if you want to keep us in business... you 'd better have a family real quick. TILLY : I wish they were rabbits.

Is n't there any romance in you? MAN : Sure, I had it, but I got rid of it. BERT : Who wants to see liver pills on their honeymoon?

MARY : Sit down, honey. You must be careful. MARY : I'II hold it. GEORGE : AII in? MARTINI : [Singing] sole mio... Stanfronte a te... O sole mio. GEORGE : Mr. and Mrs. Martini, welcome home.

That life may always have flavor. GEORGE : And wine. That joy and prosperity may reign forever. Enter the Martini castle. REINEMAN : Mr. Potter, it 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collector... but you ca n't laugh off this bailey Park anymore. [Intercom_buzzes] SECRETARY : Congressman BIatz is here, sir. POTTER : tell the congressman to wait. Go on. REINEMAN : 15 years ago... a half dozen houses here and there. squirrels, buttercups, daisies. I used to hunt rabbits there myself. Look at it today. Dozens of the prettiest little homes... 90% owned by suckers who used to pay rent to you. Your Potter 's field is becoming just that. The local yokels... are making with those David and goliath wisecracks. POTTER : Even though they know... the baileys never made a dime out of it? REINEMAN : The BaiIeys were all chumps. Every home is worth twice... what it cost the building and Loan to build. If I were you -- POTTER : You are not me. REINEMAN : It 's no skin off my nose. But one day, this bright young man... will ask George bailey for a job. bailey family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SECRETARY : Yes? POTTER : Come in here. SAM : We stopped at the new factory... then we 're driving to florida. WOMAN : Have them join us. SAM : Sure. Why do n't you drive down with us? GEORGE : Oh, I 'm afraid I could n't get away, Sam. SAM : still got the nose to the grindstone. I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics... and he turned me down. GEORGE : Do n't rub it in. SAM : I guess we 'd better run along. WOMAN : Happy to have met you, Mary. SAM : So long, George. MARY : Bye, Sam. Have fun! GEORGE : Thanks for dropping around. - Hee-haw! - Hee-haw! GEORGE : Thank you, sir. That 's quite a cigar. POTTER : You like it? I'II send you a box. GEORGE : well, I, uh... I suppose I'II find out sooner or later... but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : That 's what I Iike so much about you. I am an old man, and most people hate me... but I do n't like them either, so that makes it all even. You know just as well as I do... that I run practically everything in this town... but the bailey building and Loan. You know I 've been trying to get control or kill it... but I have n't been able to do it. You have been stopping me. In fact, you have beaten me... and as anyone can tell you, that takes some doing. Take during the Depression, for instance. You and I were the only one's that kept our heads. You saved the building and Loan. I saved all the rest. Most people say you stole all the rest. POTTER : The envious one's say that - - the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Let 's look at your side. A young man... 27, 28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Forty-five. POTTER : Forty-five. Out of which, after supporting your mother... and paying your bills... you 're able to keep, say, 10, if you skimp. A child or two comes along... and you wo n't be able to save the 10. If this young man of 28 was an ordinary yokeI... I 'd say he was doing fine... but George bailey is not an ordinary yokeI. He is an intelligent, smart, ambitious young man... who hates his job, who hates the building and Loan.... almost as much as I do. A young man who 's been dying to get out on his own... ever since he was born. A young man - - the smartest one in the crowd... who has to sit by and watch his friends go places... because he 's trapped into frittering his life away... playing nursemaid to a Iot of garlic eaters. Do I paint a correct picture, or do I exaggerate? What 's your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is I want to hire you. Hire me? POTTER : I want you to run my properties. George, I'II start you out at $20,000 a year. $20,000 a year? You would n't mind living in the nicest house in town... buying your wife a Iot of fine clothes... a couple of business trips to New York a year... maybe once in a while, Europe? You would n't mind that, would you? would I? You 're not talking to somebody else, are you? This is me. Remember me? George bailey. George bailey, right. George bailey, whose ship has just come in... provided he has enough brains to climb aboard. holy mackerel. well, how about the building and Loan? Oh, confound it! Are you afraid of success? I 'm offering you a three-years contract... at $20,000 a year starting today. Is it a deal or is n't it? Mr. Potter, I know I ought to jump at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible for you to give me... twenty-four hours to think it over? Sure, sure, sure. Go on home and talk about it to your wife. GEORGE : I 'd Iike to do that. POTTER : In the meantime, I'II draw up the papers. OK, George? OK, Mr. Potter. GEORGE : Now, wait a minute here. I do n't need 24 hours or to talk to anybody. I know right now. The answer is no! You sit around here and spin your webs... and you think the world revolves around you. well, it does n't, Mr. Potter. In the vast configuration of things... I 'd say you 're nothing but a scurvy spider. And that goes for you, too! And it goes for you, too! POTTER : You would n't mind... living in the nicest house in town... buying your wife a Iot of fine clothes... going on a couple of business trips to New York... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what I'II do tomorrow and the next day... and next year and the year after that. I 'm shaking the dust of this town off my feet... and I 'm going to see the world. Then I'II build things -- I'II build airfields. Skyscrapers 100 stories high. A bridge a mile long. What is it you want, Mary? You want the moon? Say the word... I'II throw a lasso around it and pull her down for you. MARY : [Singing] buffalo gal, wo n't you come out tonight? Wo n't you come out tonight? Wo n't you come out tonight? buffalo gal, wo n't you come out tonight... And... - Hi. - Hi. Mary Hatch... Why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me? MARY : To keep from being an old maid. GEORGE : You could have married Sam Wainwright... and anybody else in town. MARY : I did n't want to marry anybody else in town. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We did n't even have a honeymoon. I promised you - - Your what? MARY : My baby. GEORGE : Your b - - your - - your... Mary, you on the nest? MARY : George bailey Iassos stork. GEORGE : Lassos a stork? well... You mean, y-you 're... What is it, a boy or a girl? MARY : Mm-hmm. JOSEPH : Now you 've probably already guessed... that George never leaves Bedford falls. CLARENCE : No. JOSEPH : Mary had her baby, a boy. Then she had another one, a girl. Day after day, she worked... remaking the old GranviIIe house into a home. Night after night... George came back late from the office. JOSEPH : Potter was bearing down hard. JOSEPH : Then came a war. Ma bailey and Mrs. Hatch... joined the Red Cross and sewed.

George fought the battle of Bedford falls. GEORGE : hold on! hold on now! Do n't you know there 's a war on? JOSEPH : Air raid warden... [blows_whistle] JOSEPH : Paper drives, scrap drives... rubber drives. Like everybody else... on V-E Day, he wept and prayed. On V-J Day, he wept and prayed again.

You just ca n't keep those BaiIeys down. POTTER : How does slacker George feel about that? BILLY : Very jealous. He only lost three buttons off his vest. George would have gotten two if he had gone.

No securities, no stocks, no bonds - - nothing but a miserable little $500 equity... in a life insurance policy. Hee hee! You 're worth more dead than alive. Why do n't you go to the riffraff you love so much... and ask them to let you have 8,000? You know why? Because they 'd run you out of town on a rail. But I'II tell you what I 'm going to do for you. Since the state examiner is still here... as a stockholder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swear out a warrant for your arrest - - misappropriation of funds, manipulation, malfeasance.
