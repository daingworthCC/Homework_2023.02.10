5234041 Previously on Eureka... S.A.R.A.H., you infected Andy with some kind of emotional... I did n't infect him, I improved him. Andy, I really like you. Wow. Our goal for this selection process has been to find the best of the best in Eureka. What we really want to know is, why space? What, or who inspired you to pursue it? They 've made their final selections for the Astraeus mission, and she wants me to inform the candidates. You did n't make it, Jo. I know. I withdrew my name from consideration. You what? No, we did this together. We should be going together. But space is n't my dream. Did you? Yeah. Did you? We made it! Congratulations, Dr. Marten. - You earned it. - Thank you, Isaac. Your selection is merely another example of bureaucracy rewarding mediocrity. My condolences to Titan. Whoa. Morning, S.A.R.A.H. S.A.R.A.H.? Morning. I think my house took the day off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security for the official portrait of the Astraeus crew. Oh, so you 'll be with Zane. Well, he 's been, uh, giving me the stink-eye since I pulled my name out of contention. Does he think you made a mistake? Did you? No. I was in it for the wrong reasons. I... I... I do n't need to go to Titan. Because you 're happy here. - Yes. - Ah. I 'm happy here. S.A.R.A.H., can I have some coffee, too, please? Well, she ca n't be busy. Morning, folks. - Oh. - Yes, she can. Good morning, sheriff Carter, Ms. Lupo. Is n't it a beautiful day? Uh, yeah. Andy, uh, this is the, uh, third day this week that you 've slept over, yeah? Neither S.A.R.A.H. nor I actually require sleep. We use the evening hours to engage in, uh, intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na have to lay down some ground rules for these sleepovers, all right? Will those rules also apply to you and Dr. Blake? Uh, no. ' Cause we 're human, and it 's my house. Oh. Okay. Well, I guess I better get ready for work, then. - I... - That was n't very nice. Well, come on. It 's not like the toaster has guys sleep over. S.A.R.A.H., what was that? Sheriff Carter 's breakfast accidentally fell into the garbage disposal. Oh! Very mature! Ms. Lupo, would you please tell sheriff Carter that I 'm receiving a call for police assistance at Dr. Welke 's farm? I 've got ears, S.A.R.A.H., I 'm right here. Dr. Welke 's part of the Astraeus crew. Did he, uh, did he mention what happened? He 's reporting that Lenore has liquefied. Excuse me? Well, no more cowbell. I checked on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited about the Titan mission. Huh? We 're sending cows to space? She 's just a host until I pack my scabies for the trip. I 'm an acarologist. Uh, Dr. Welke studies cow mites. But I ca n't test the hardiness of xylene-treated acari in a nitrogen-methane environment now, can I? All clear. Taggart? Back in town? I 'm Astraeus ground supervisor for bio-organic experiments. Been gathering up projects from around the world. Oh. Just brought in a shipment yesterday. - Jackie! - Ah! Yo, ho ho! Jo, sweetheart, well, it 's great to see you. Though I wish it were under happier circumstances. Yeah, uh, any idea what happened? Do n't know... never seen cellular breakdown like this in a vertebrate. Well, is there any chance maybe you brought a little germ hitchhiker with you - from another project? - Well, possibly. Gon na head back and see if anything else was affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh. Sure. Could you take this to Allison for analysis? Yeah, nothing says, " good morning, " like a jar of... cow. Hey! Did... Jo Did you, um... Have you talked to him? Since 1947? Since everything 's changed? No. Any idea if you were involved? No clue. What the hell is this? Oh, well, must be, uh, critters in the rafters. Oh, you think? Farms are gross. So... any luck? Nah, I 'm... I 'm set to 1db per division, but, um, still... no signal. Well, it 's a billion miles away, so nailing the frequency will take some time. But we do n't have much time. I mean, I know it 's only a temporary camera, but the whole idea of FTL-ing the comm-system in advance was to establish a link before you get to Titan with the crew. - You mean... my crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Astraeus. I knew you were being considered, but oh, my God! Well, it 's official. Senator Wen just called. It 's crazy, right? Well, she could n't have found a more qualified person, captain Monroe. Thank you, ground commander Deacon. Oh! Excuse me. Cargo unit B-17 's at capacity. Should we move it onto a launch pad? - Yes. - No. Ah... We 're still on the ground, ground commander. Whatever works for you. Well, I will inspect the unit first, and then you can move it. Yes, sir. - We 'll figure this out. - Mm-hmm. Well, hey! Coming to you live from the surface of Titan. Want to play doctor? Hmm? What? Jack. That 's virtual harassment. Oh, I... I had a dream that went sort of like this. Aw! No, she was... It 's a VR communication prototype for Astraeus. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh, I got you, I got you. I hated sleepaway camp. But this should help the crew feel more bonded with home, if I can get it to work for more than a few minutes at a time. I like our solution... Which is staying together. What is that? Oh, um, I 'll give you a hint. What 's, uh, black and white and dead all over? Astraeus astronauts, please report to hangar " A " for official crew photo. All 20 members, please report... Sorry, Parrish, official crew portrait. No alternates. Uh, we 're still officially members of the mission. - Whatever you say. - Doug. First alternate is still an amazing achievement. It 's like... - You 're almost a winner. - Almost. This is n't over. Until that ship launches... I still have a shot. Okay, people! Group photo! So... ready to spend a few months in space with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off. Zane, I was kidding. Yeah. Well, we take this mission very seriously. So, uh, captain, huh? Congratulations. I guess that means you 'll be the first. Uh, the first what? The first person to set foot on Titan. Oh, well, that... That honor has n't been determined yet. Well, in that case, I 'd like to put my best foot forward. I am the head of G.D. You 're playing the head-of - G.D. card? It seems to me that the first person should be a woman. You 're playing the girl card? You guys got the moon. We should get Titan. - It 's Even-Steven. - Okay, um, I know we 're all really excited. But right now, we need to focus on the launch. So, let 's get to work. Briefing in ten. Okay. Well, I see why she 's the captain. Oh, yeah. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that? Uh, Henry, shut it down. Ignition sequence activated. - Henry, shut it down. - It wo n't deactivate. - Ignition activated. - Everybody out! - Get out! Everybody out! - Five... - Come on, let 's go! - Four... Three... Two... One... Boss, get out of the way! Jack? You okay? Yeah! Where 's Andy? - Hello-o-o! Unh. Hey, guys! Look at me! Huh? I 'm on Titan. There 's our stuff. Ha ha ha! Andy, you okay? Doin ' great, Dr. Deacon. Little chilly, though. I can feel my joint lubricant thickening. Do n't worry, Andy, we 'll figure this out and get you home. Hold on a minute. It 's 290 degrees below 0 on Titan. There 's no way he can tolerate that for very long. Six hours. - Less, may... maybe. - What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive somehow and send it to him? With an internal power supply, Andy could transport himself home. Okay, I will get Zane and Fargo started. Good. I 'll run some diagnostics - and reset the FTL. - Okay. Well, there 's some tenderness over the bone. Probably just have some bruising. - You were lucky. - Oh, thanks to Andy, yeah. How 's he holding up? Uh, first off, we 're trying to get him home, but he 'll be fine. Jack, he 's a billion miles away, freezing and breathing corrosive chemicals. This time could be different. Yeah, uh... It 's from Welke. He wants answers about his cow. Poor Lenore. I have n't found any biological pathogens, no prions or parasites. Right now there 's no evidence that it came from inside the animal. Then... outside? so... so somebody did this to the cow? Did the cow have many enemies? Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean, he 's a seat on the mission, right? Well, uh... who takes his place if he ca n't go? An alternate. Right. First alternate. Thanks, doc. Looks like we 're going to need another bottle, Vincent, and, uh, some more blinis, if you do n't mind. Comin ' right up. Champagne. What you celebrating? Actually, it 's Prosecco, and I am going to Titan. Dr. Welke had to resign. Turns out there 's no point in him going without his experiment. What a tragedy. Would you like a blini, sheriff Carter? Why would I sabotage an experiment? It would ruin my chances of getting on the mission. Yes, if you got caught, which is what 's happening right now. Oh! I did n't do anything to Welke 's stupid cow, sheriff! You know how I know? Because cows do n't melt! Ah... Ow! How ' bout jeeps? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're rigging up cadmium aerogel insulation to protect the drive. How 's Andy holding up? You ca n't keep a good deputy down. Yeah, because he 's not a quitter. Well, I 'm going to go and help an Australian find some slime. Let me know if you need anything. You know, it 's her choice to not go to Titan. What? I do n't care. Dude, do you know how many hours I spent coaching her on orbital mechanics? And hydrostatics? And then she just drops out. Leaves me... Leaves you how? Nothin '. She 's a waste of my time. Can we just get back to trying to save Andy? Cockroaches, not melted. Tarantulas, not melted. Millipedes, not melted. Uh-oh, I... I think this one went the way of the cow. Oh. That one 's supposed to be goo. Plasmodial slime mold. Ca n't go to Titan without your slime mold. So, what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Oh, you know, this and that. Tagging ostriches in the Sahara for a bit. And when we last saw each other... Ah, water under the bridge, doll. Look, um... I 'm not gon na say it did n't sting when you turned me down. I turned you down? My proposal. You playing at something, Jo? No, no. I just... I 'm sorry, I was... You asked me, and I turned you down. Because that 's what I do. Okay, so, uh, what 's next? Mosquito larvae, not melted. Breeding mosquitoes for the Astraeus habitat. Well, that 's not gon na score you points with the crew. No, these are feeder ' skeeters, sustenance for my eptesicus fuscus. Big, brown bats. Happy in Earth 's atmosphere, but able to withstand a high-methane environment like Titan... Genetically modified to provide fuel via their guano. Want to take a peek? No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're... They 're beauts! Taggart... They 're gone. Firing circuits are charged, and ready. - Are we? - Yes, ready when you are. Fargo, we are ready. Just about in position. Let 's hope it works this time. - Hi. - Hey. Oh, listen, we 're, uh, sending the portable FTL drive to him now. Um... what do... what do a cow and a jeep have in common? What? Well, um, what would cause them both to melt? All right, we 're ready. Uh, safety 's off. A cow melted? Um... hey, Andy? You, uh, you okay? Well, if I had a hot cocoa, I would n't complain. His skin is starting to vitrify in the cold. Right, well, tell you what... When you come back, we go to Cafe Diem, cocoa 's on me. Ready to activate. Ignition sequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One... What was that? Really? It did n't work, did it? No, Jack, the blowback destroyed it on the pad. Astronaut Andy, ready for departure. Henry, how are we gon na get him home now? All emergency personnel... Any time now. I do n't know what else to do, Jack. All emergency personnel, please report... Guys? I 'm ready! Ready to come home! I get why Parrish would melt the cow, but why me bat crates? Let 's ask your bats. Hey, are you sure we 're on the right track? I mean, we 've got ta be a good mile out from G.D. by now. Aha. They 've been here. Recently. Might be looking for a dark place to roost. Every circuit for the FTL drive is falling offline. Oh. How did this happen? I do n't know, but I 'm going to find out before I let my crew go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Maybe... 4 1/2 hours. The atmosphere is already starting to corrode his peripheral systems. Right. If we ca n't get him back, like, worst-case scenario, we just order a new Andy and plug in the backup disc, right? No. It does n't work that way. First, Andy 's a... A prototype. Second, everything Andy 's experienced through his emotion software builds unique pathways in his processing core. - So he 's, uh... - A one-of-a-kind. Right. Whoa! Boys, check this out. The circuits... are liquefying. Wait, you said something about melting. Yeah. Lenore. And my jeep. And maybe G.D. Ah! Oh. How is he? Well, it 's a clean fracture. But he needs to stay off of it for six to eight weeks. Five minutes. I was a real astronaut... for five minutes. That stupid grinning robot gets to go to Titan, - and I have to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is stranded on Titan, and I think you 're involved. Oh, leave me alone! Look, whatever voodoo science you did is out of control. And it messed with Henry 's FTL machine. I... Did... Not... Melt... Lenore! I think that he 's telling the truth. I scanned a sample of your liquefied jeep off of his shoe. Welke 's cow and your jeep did n't melt. They protonated. What? Melting is a change in phase-state. Ice melts into liquid water. Protonation is violent. Their subatomic components actually ripped apart. Well, it does n't matter how he did it. The point is that he did it. So he did n't melt my jeep, he protonated it. Only a superacid could do that to your jeep. And it would leave fluorosulfuric traces in Parrish 's body, and there were none in his blood test. - Oh. - Told ya. Taggart... Jim... I, uh, in case I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened... Well, do n't even. Well, no I... I hope I did n't hurt you. Well, thanks, sweetheart. It means a lot. I 'm not gon na say it did n't take me a while to get me bearings, but, uh, then I went on walkabout. Walkabout? Where 'd you, uh, - where 'd you walk to? - No, there is no " to. " You just go. A journey of self-discovery. You 'd hate it. The point is, when I was done, well, I 'd made me peace. With us. Peace. Well, that 'd be... nice. Feel that? What? That breeze. Duck! Oh! Ah! No! Found ' em. Tell Allison this sample is from the main circuit panel. Okay. And is the system still melting? Well, Zane and Fargo are trying to slow it down, but unless Allison can determine what 's causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 'll figure it out, and we can get him home. Jack, even if we can replace the melted wire, we do n't have a portable FTL to bring Andy back home. It was destroyed. And I do n't know if we can rebuild it. - Hey, boss! - You there? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, pal, I 'm right here. My sensors are detecting a pretty severe methane storm, approaching due West. Uh, well, then you might want to work on building a shelter to break the wind. Will do. Uh, even so, the methane concentration is pretty intense. I 'm bound to corrode. You 've been through worse. Right? And if anybody can handle it, you can. Hey, boss. Yeah. I need a favor. S.A.R.A.H.? S.A.R.A.H., um... Sorry about this morning, but, uh... We have to talk. All right, sheriff. It 's a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of accident? Andy 's stranded on Titan. That is far too harsh an environment - for his soft skin! - Yeah. You must get him back to Earth as soon as possible. Right, and we 're doing everything that we can. But just in case, he 's asked me to tell you. That you 're his... Casita bonita. I guess he really cares about you. I just did n't... appreciate how much. Sheriff, there 's movement in my conduits. Yeah, I... I... You can feel... emotional. No, my sensors are registering unidentified movement inside my conduits. Un... identified movement? Whoa! Ohh! Oh oh oh! And the 10,000 little needle claws in me, and S.A.R.A.H. ' S all covered in crap. It 's called guano, actually. Oh, thank you, Batman, where are they now? Well, they left the S.M.A.R.T. house through the gamma conduit, so they probably have a roost in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control. On it. H... hey, Jo. What 's up? Fire suppression is in effect. All personnel have been evacuated. No, they have n't, you frakkin ' brainless piece of software! Put your back into it, Parrish! Hey... Where 's the fire? There is n't one! The suppression system went off by itself and sealed the doors! - And the misty stuff? - Sucking out all the oxygen. Ah! Ah! Damn it! - All right, everybody out! - Come on, people, let 's go! - Everybody out! - Come with me! Out! Out! Come on, let 's go! All personnel have been evacuated. Let 's keep going. Keep it moving! Let me guess. These are the sensors that are supposed to detect when there are people inside. Yes. Same sensors that detect when there 's a fire. More protonation. That 's melting. - Well, so much for G.D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong lab, and this place goes boom. I 'll institute fire-safety protocols. Shut down any combustion-related projects. Well, that 's great, but if we ca n't figure this out, a broken sprinkler system 's gon na be the least of our problems. Oof. Oh! Taggart? Blast! Nearly caught up with the wiley little buggers. Uh, were the bats in the walls? - Uh-uh. Passing through back home on their way to the roost. Judging from their spoor. That 's disgusting. Wait. Did you track them back to Welke 's farm, or to the FTL service passage? Well, both. Uh, they escaped on the road near Welke 's farm then turned toward G.D. So things are melting wherever the bats fly? S.A.R.A.H. Check you out, man, you beat me to it. First bachelor pad on Titan. I do n't think S.A.R.A.H. would like that very much! Atta boy. Keep thinking about S.A.R.A.H. She 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @.? Talk to me. Hello, sheriff. Hey! How ya... how ya doing? You all right? No. I can feel my connections dissolving. - It hurts. - Okay. All right. We 'll get you some help, okay? You just hang on. Oh... Fargo, get here as soon as you can. - Sheriff? - Yeah? Please tell deputy Andy that I love him. Okay. - Hey, guys. - Hey, how 's S.A.R.A.H.? Well, uh, Fargo has her hooked up to some sort of computer life-support system, but we need an answer fast. And the answer is bats. Yeah, but, how 's a bat gon na make something melt? Taggart genetically altered their binary parotid glands. Why would you do that? Oh, to create guano rich in perchloric acid. Uh, clean, safe fuel for the Titan habitat. The problem is, the guano 's transforming into some kind of superacid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to be an activating agent, a common element in all the affected materials. Okay, uh, what do we got? We got, uh, the cow, uh, my jeep, and the FTL jumping machine, so... What do they have in common? Okay, I... I... let 's try aminos, phenols, uh, xylene. Xylene, xy... um, Dr. Welke 's, uh, cow fleas were made of xylene. It 's also in wire insulation, uh, S.A.R.A.H. ' s walls, uh, auto paint. That... That would explain my jeep. All my bio-containment crates were xylene-based. They crapped their way out? Potential acidity factor is off the charts. Ho... hold... hold on. Bat doody and xylene make superacid? Right. Bat doody, really? Well... - Hey, check this out. - We need to find those bats. You said you knew where they were roosting. Getting closer. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right here, where the smiley face is. A massive storage tank full of methyl iodide gas. - It 's perfect. - But it 's poison. Uh, for them, I mean. Nice and homey. Uh, if you like the atmosphere on Titan, - which they do. - Okay. To neutralize the superacid and stop the melting I 'm gon na need an enzyme sample from the binary parotid gland of one of those bats. - We 're gon na have to go inside. - Oh, wait, wait. Into the huge tank of poison-gas bats and superacid? Ah, yeah! Awesome. Sorry. Wow. Was that so hard? What are you talking about? Sorry. ' Cause I never heard you say it before. Zane, leaving the mission was the right decision for me. Look, I should n't have to apologize, because it 's not about you. Yeah, then maybe you should 've clarified that - before I got involved. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that told me to try. And you let me think you really wanted to go the distance when you were really just playing around. Fine. Fine. I am sorry for not knowing exactly what I wanted. Hmm? Well, that 's the crappiest apology ever, is n't it? Do n't dawdle in there. It 'll be not long before our gear starts dissolving in the tank. Fantastic. Ho.. Ly.. crap, Batman. Now, to get a proper sample, we 'll need a mature female. Well, let 's get one and get the hell outta here. Unfortunately, a colony of brown bats is normally 85% male. Of course it is. And the difference between the boys and the girls is, uh... Females are larger. Ready? For what? You sure that 's a good idea? I 'm provoking a startle response. I can see that. Male. Male. Male. Male. Female? One... Two... Three... Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is. Are n't you, slugger? Okay. Okay. Bye-bye, bats. Better wrangle me strays and seal this place up. Allison and Taggart isolated the amino acids from the bats. Now I just need to repair the damage to the FTL. I 'm already on it. How 's S.A.R.A.H.? On artificial life support. I was able to connect an external hard drive before the crash, but, um, we 'll know more once she 's rebooted. Thanks for asking. Well, I know how attached you are. In a not-at-all creepy way. They may be A.I., but S.A.R.A.H. and Andy have a real connection. It would be tragic if they could n't say good-bye, and she became our first A.I. widow. Well, we all have to live with disappointment. Enough with the doom and gloom already. It 's so obvious. What are you talking about? You and Jo. What, that she wasted my time? That you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her. It 's not my place to be disappointed. It 's not like we 're even officially dating. Honestly, I do n't know what we are. Then find out. Pushing her away is n't making it easier on either of you. Current temperature, 310 degrees below 0. Wind speed, 122 knots. Hang in there, Andy. You 're doin ' great. My internal diagnostics tell me quite the opposite. But, uh... Thank you for saying otherwise. Well, no one ever said being a deputy in Eureka was easy. You know, uh, it 's kind of funny, Jo... Me being here on Saturn 's largest moon. Uh, funny, how? You wake up in the morning and... You never know where the day is gon na take you. Well, that is funny. Hey, Henry. The methane storm is damaging the camera. The image has been deteriorating over the last hour. It 's okay, we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of hours. We 'll patch up the FTL, - we can get a... - Uh, Carter, we do n't have a couple of hours. His inner shielding has been compromised. Oh. Thanks. Hey, buddy. Hey, boss! So how 's your day going? Well, uh... Andy? - Andy? - Boss? Can you hear me? Andy? Boss! Hey! No, Jack, um, we 've lost the feed. Hey! How are the repairs going? Well, too slow. Andy does n't have much time. I know. You know, um... I know he 's a robot, but, uh... I feel bad. I mean, I just wish there was something I could do. You 've done a lot. He still has a chance because of you. - Well... - Hey! Hey, listen. We 've improvised an FTL slingshot that has a chance of grabbing Andy back from Titan. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he arrived when that wormhole opens. Now, we 've lost the comm feed, so there 's no way for us to tell him where he needs to be. Maybe we could show him. Here, come here. Hey, partner. How 's it going? Andy? Heeeey. Are you an angel? Not even close. Allison gave me a holo-communicator she 's been testing for the mission. Look, right now we got to get back to the place where you zapped in. I do n't know if I can make it, boss. Just try, buddy. What 's a sheriff without a deputy? The FTL extraction point is just ahead. It should be a piece of cake. Easy for the hologram to say. Come on, buddy. All right? S.A.R.A.H. needs you home safe. Wow. Well, there 's something you do n't see every day. Andy, we 've got to reach that boulder, right over there. As soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you back. Okay? Try? Just hurry. I 'm losing the signal. Okay. I lost the signal. He was a few steps away. Stand by. - Oh! - Oh! Yeah! Hey. Oh-h-h... Th... thanks for bringing me back, boss. Well, I 'd say we 're even. - Okay. - Okay. Hey. How 's Andy? Defrosting, but he 'll recover. Yeah, he 's tough. Could I? Sure. What 's up? Now, just... just give me a sec, okay? Okay, this mission is a big deal. - Oh! - I know. It 's history. It 's just when I thought about doing it, I always thought about doing it with you. I am sorry... If I let you down. Less crappy apology? Yeah, a little. So for the record, what is this? You and me? - We 're friends. - Yeah? Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before. It... Yeah, I got that, but... but... But that 's... not what you 're asking me, is it? You want to know if I 'll wait for you? Will you? I do n't know. Because you do n't know how you feel about me? No, no, because I... I do n't know how I feel about a lot of things. And I am trying to figure it out, I... I just ca n't make that kind of a promise until I do. Okay. Okay? Honesty. I never thought we 'd get here. I guess you never know where the day will take you. Yeah. Fargo? You there? Yup. Well, we stopped the melting and replaced the damaged components. All that 's left now is to bring her back online. Did you recover her memory files? Unfortunately, they were corrupted during the melting. Some of her data was permanently lost. Well, let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well, we 're about to find out. S.A.R.A.H.? You there? Yes, Dr. Fargo. How are you? I 'm fine. It 's good to hear my... your voice. Hey, S.A.R.A.H. Uh, you had us worried there for a second. Worried about what, sheriff? - Uh... - Nothing. I have someone here for you, someone who 's pretty anxious to talk to ya. Hi, honey. I 'm home. S.A.R.A.H.? Everything okay? I 'm sorry. I forget sometimes that you ca n't see me smile. I was afraid I 'd lost you, baby. Take more than a Titanic methane storm to keep me from my gal. Come get warm. It 's 290 degrees below 0 on Titan. So I discovered. Thank you. I try not to think about it. Well, I guess my work here is done. You did a great job, Fargo. - Thanks. - All in a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na have another houseguest for a while. Yeah. Seems that way. It 's okay. Does n't feel so crowded. Jo was n't enough? You want Andy, too? Well, I... want you. I think a... A house is n't a home unless you share it with the person that you love. You realize I come as a package deal with Kevin and Jenna, right? Really? You... no... Yeah. Living together, huh?
