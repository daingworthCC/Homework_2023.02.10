5210141 Stage 13 of the Tour de France, quite possibly the most difficult climb of the entire race. But one rider, Italy 's JuJu Peppi, is absolutely burning up this mountain... nearing the top of the Pyrenees minutes ahead of the pack. He 's practically dancing on the pedals as he blasts past other riders, showing no signs of fatigue. The Tour de France, the cr? me de la cr? me of cycling. At some point during the three-week race, half the world will tune in. With 3.5 billion viewers, it is far and away the most-watched sporting event on Earth, but it is also perhaps the most controversial. JuJu 's opened an impressive lead with his record-setting pace. JuJu now relieving himself, which is a thing that cyclists actually do, and he 's making quite a mess as he continues to burn up the mountainside. Unbelievable! JuJu Peppi 's legs pumping away, pushing his body to its absolute limits! How is he doing this? How is he doing this? And just then... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's into the tuck for the downhill. No one even knew he was dead for about 12 kilometers. Look at that form! He 's perfectly still for optimum wind resistance! He died... with his dick out. In the autopsy, they found out JuJu was on EPO and cocaine. Also, some insulin and anabolic steroids, Oxabolone and Nandrolone. Trace amounts of Norethandrolone and Furazabol. They even found some heroin in his system. There was also Letrozole and Cyclazadone, some estrogen receptor modulators, Raloxifene and Tamoxifen... probably to ward off breast growth. A lot of Oxycodone in his blood, Phentermine as well. Ortetamine, Bunolol, and Labetalol. Plus he had apparently huffed ethanol and taken a couple MDAs. He had clearly smoked some crystal meth and/or crack, and there was a hormone from monkey testicles that he had cooked down into a broth that he drank. He also had apparently eaten at least one sandwich from Arby 's. JuJu Peppi gave himself a huge edge at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my God! What the fuck? Jesus Christ! But he was far from alone that year. In what has now become known as the Tour de Pharmacy, athletes took drug abuse to a level never seen before or thereafter, creating supermen in Superman spandex, attempting to traverse 2,179 miles and over some of the most treacherous mountain ranges on the planet. But how do you tell the story of a bike race, the story of 170 extreme personalities all vying for a common goal? You probably could, but it would take forever. Luckily, we only have to tell the story of five of them. Well, the atmosphere is positively electric as the town of Basel has gathered to greet the riders who have come from all over the world. Here 's one now, arriving all the way from the United States, Slim Robinson. Hey. Hi, Slim. Welcome. Slim Robinson was sports royalty. His uncle was Jackie Robinson, who, of course, was the first black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slim excelled at many different sports, but obviously struggled to stand out like his uncle, because he was n't the only black athlete... until he found cycling, which was very white. And it made him happy, because it was the last sport where he could break the color line. My uncle was the first black something. I wanted to be the first black something too. First one to ever do it, baby. Woo! Slim Robinson! Seeing another black man on a bicycle was a huge deal for me, you know? So, a lot of people think of me as a boxer, but what they really did n't know is that I love bicycles. When I was a kid, I got a Schwinn bicycle, and, man, I would ride that bicycle all over New York City. But then one day my bicycle was stolen. When I finally found out who stole my bicycle, I beat the shit outta that kid, man. And I realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a cyclist. " And this is how I became a boxer. My whole life, people have been referring to me as the nephew of Jackie Robinson. But I think after what I do here today, they 're gon na start calling him " Slim 's uncle. " Really? You think that people will start to call Jackie Robinson " Slim 's uncle "? Absolutely. Yeah. I disagree. But what no one knew was that the color barrier would not be the only barrier to fall that year. Because I am woman, everyone think I can not do what a man can do. " How can you ride without the dick and the balls? How can you ride a bike with a... how you say? You say " pussy. " So, this is why I had to disguise myself as a man. Adrian Baton, the great French mystery. Being your first Tour, were you rattled by anything? The... the shaving of legs. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first, uh... I am a man, you are a man. We do n't shave our legs. Right, but as a cyclist, it 's essential, is n't it? But it is weird. It was my first time talking in public as a man... Someone smells of lilac. Is it her? Oh, yes, uh, very lilac and very hot. Ho, ho, ho, ho, what a hot chick. And I think I nailed it. There were still other firsts at the ' 82 Tour, including the appearance of Marty Hass, the first-ever African cyclist. Marty Hass. Marty Hass. Africa! What 's up, Africa? Feeling strong, ready for the race? Woo! Oh, I was... I was just, uh, psyched, psyched, psyched to be there, you know, representing Nigeria and all my Nigerian brothers and chicks. Marty 's father owned a diamond mine near Nigeria 's capital... where he went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nigerians. At a young age, Marty established himself as the country 's best cyclist, because everyone else was on bicycles made out of wood. But on a serious note, Rex, it is truly an honor to be here to represent Africa, because... I do n't know if you know this, but Africa 's actually going through some pretty weak stuff. Right. For example, oftentimes, it 'll get pretty warm there. Here in Nigeria, we hate Marty Hass. Marty Hass would walk into a bar, then he would go over to the jukebox and put on Bob Marley, " Legend, " and be shouting, " African music! " Jamaica is not in Africa. Well, you seem very, very proud of your homeland. Indeed I am. You know, I miss it. Being here in France, I miss it back home, and... I bless the rains down in Africa. Right, right, like the song. Oh, I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Toto song, " Africa. " Uh, I 'm not familiar with that. But at any rate, it 's gon na take a lot... To drag me away from you. From you. That 's what I was gon na say! Shall we do it in harmony? That 's so bizarre. I was gon na say, " Drag me away from you, from this great interview. " Real Africans did n't like that song, " Africa. " That 's why he was lying. You ever seen the dudes in the band Toto? Those dudes should n't be singing about Africa. There 's an " honor among thieves " code in cycling, and openly discussing the use of performance-enhancing drugs is certainly off-limits. But we found one former cyclist who was bold enough to speak frankly under the guise of anonymity. I 'm standing here with the legendary Gustav Ditters. You look like you 're going to be carrying a few extra pounds on the bike this year. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard, on the bicycle. Well, it is quite impressive. Looks almost like you could play a real sport. Everyone was cheating. Everyone... except for me. I 'm gon na have to work extra hard to keep up with you out there. That 's right, you heard it. This year, I 'll be on the bike, riding alongside the riders, conducting my interviews during the race, that is if I do n't pass out immediately. What do you think about that, Gustav? Fucking hell, mate. The 1982 Tour de France was the most eccentric bike race in the history of cycling, in large part due to the fact that virtually every rider in the race was doping, nearly all 170 of them. The reason every rider was on drugs in the ' 82 race has to do with the fact that credit cards were introduced to Finland the year before. KultaBank issued the first Finnish charge card, and they announced it with a bizarre commercial. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons at least. First of all, why is going down on his wife payment for this guy? And what 's he paying for? Spilling the milk? We saw him spill the milk, so why is she drinking milk in the very next scene? You 'll notice the woman does n't climax, which means the debt has not been fully repaid, and likely never will. Right, guys? Sorry, I just noticed the crew is mostly women. I 'm not good at oral sex. The disciplinary cunnilingus shown in the commercials certainly did not do its job explaining credit cards to the people of Finland. And this included the former president of the UCI, Ditmer Klerken. Well, the UCI was in charge of testing all the riders for doping, and the guy in charge of that had a serious credit card problem. I would see something, like a cool car a cool horse, or something like this, and... and I would hand them this magic piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After three months, Ditmer owed nearly $16 million U.S. to KultaBank. Because he was in this huge debt, Ditmer sent every rider a note saying if they paid him $50,000, they would n't get drug-tested that year. " Hey, if you do n't want to be drug tested, " make a check out to Ditmer Klerken " in the amount of $50,000 U.S. " and you wo n't be. Thanks you guys, Ditmer. " PS, if you tell anyone about this, I 'll fucking kill you! " Silly. And here we go! The 1982 Tour de France has officially begun! Guys came out flying on bikes! Man, I wanted to be on a bike so bad. Day one, 207 kilometers from Basel to Mohlin, up and over some of the most breathtaking Hillscapes in the world. A serene landscape that was completely juxtaposed to the ugliness that was about to ensue. The riders still holding tight in the Peloton. JuJu Peppi not surprisingly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've got a beautiful fan up ahead! Hey, hey, Bella senora! And JuJu went in for the grope and is losing balance! Can he stay up? Oh no! Oh no! JuJu 's lost his balance! He 's fallen over! It 's a terrible crash! Yay! People are beginning to stand, which is a good sign. Is-a not my fault! - I lose-a sight of the road! - Hey, JuJu! Whoa! Jabin Dolchey was known for two things ; Fighting and his outfits that he claimed to be made from a high-tech breathable material he called Spanlon. Jabin Dolchey! Speed the competition! He was an odd bird, and he seemed proud of what everyone could see was a very tiny, misshaped penis. Jabin 's punch kicked off the most massive scuffle in Tour history. Well, this is just awful. These men are literally trying to tear one another apart. Cyclists are incredible athletes as far as endurance goes, but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had a dance party, and people said it was a fight. As a boxer, it was offensive to me. And as is with every accident near Switzerland, a Saint Bernard is the first responder. It 's really peaty. They tried to hurt each other, but I am a... a peaceful person. I do n't do things like that. Please! No! No! I beg you! No! No! Please! I 'm naked! Please put me down! Everything I did that day, I did in self-defense. French authorities finally arrived and put the kibosh on the fracas. The first day was canceled, but with no major injuries, the race was expected to resume the following day, were it not for a forsaken water bottle. Ah! Ooh! Woo! If you take too strong a dose of amphetamines, they can act as a super powerful aphrodisiac. No, no, no. Oui. No! No! No! No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I ended up having sex with a... Oh, we have to try every drug on our banned list, so we know what we 're dealing with. I actually paint what the experiences are like, so I can remember the effects of each drug. Would you like to see them? So, this is what I painted while I was on amphetamines. It 's kind of what I felt like when I did the drug. Yeah. This is when I did crack cocaine, so you can see how similar the two drugs are. Oh, this is from when I did meth. So, you can see that meth is a very different drug than the other two. Yeah. And all of these are for sale. In an attempt to quell the media frenzy, the water bottle created, Ditmer Klerken held a press conference. Ditmer, Ditmer. There are reports that you asked every rider for $50,000 if they did not want to be drug tested. Is... is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean, no. Fuck! No. I mean... no, I mean it 's not... not true. Ah fuck! Ah. Now you guys are never going to believe me because I said it was true right away. But no, no, no, that 's... that 's not true. But does anybody know if you admit to something like taking bribes and you give all the money back, for instance, does that mean that you could keep your job? Ah! What a crazy hypothetical question. Where do I even come up with this stuff? And nobody ask me if I 'm cheating on my wife, because I am. Ah! I 'm kidding. No, no. Shit! And one by one, nearly every participant in the race was disqualified for sending the bribe money. Of the 170 riders entered, only five did not send checks. With only five riders left, it seemed the Tour would be canceled. I did n't pay Ditmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the race, then I am punished for what? Why punish me? Look at me. You put a little coke-a in your nose, take a shit, have great sex, wake up-a the next day, and you are like a... champion. No, I would never do that. Are you crazy? In an unprecedented decision, the UCI has decided to allow the Tour de France to continue with only the five remaining cyclists, the final five, which I am dubbing The Fab 5. You heard it here first, ladies and gentlemen, these five riders will forever be known as The Fab 5. Not to be confused with the Fab Five, the Michigan basketball team who ultimately became much more famous. Who 's that? That 's Chris Webber. - What? - From the wrong Fab Five. Well, fuck. Who... why did... why did you bring him here? I do n't know. Somebody fucked up. What are we supposed to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom, then we all leave. Here we are, Stage 2, Tour de France! It 's a 250 kilometer ride through flat plains from Basel to Nancy. Here we are, Tour de France, day two, and I 'm riding right alongside the riders, getting the scoop straight from the horse 's mouth, so to speak. And to no one 's surprise, it 's JuJu in the lead. I was really impressed, what a great rider Rex was. I mean, he was right there in the front of the pack most of the time with that microphone. He was riding with the greatest cyclists in the world. Well, it 's only day two. Do n't kill yourself. Got another three weeks to go. I'm-a no kill myself. I'm-a never die, not on a bicycle. That is a sure thing. And JuJu did n't die that day, but he did eventually, as you know, because we showed it to you at the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow jersey, then celebrated that night with a well-earned massage. Each night, the depleted muscles must be softened in readiness for the torture ahead. The riders ' bulging, shaved quadriceps and smooth, taut hamstrings require deep tissue massage with the finest oils available and strong fingers. All that built up lactic acid can finally be ejaculated. After that, I passed out, but not before, I remember, making everybody promise to take turns riding up front so the rest of us could draft. You got ta take it down a notch out there, JuJu. You 're going too hard. Marty 's right. It 's just the five of us. Yeah, we got ta work together, and all start drafting for each other. One of the most important elements of cycling is drafting, and that 's when the cyclists take turns breaking the wind at the front of the pack. It 's much harder on the rider in the front, but everyone behind him expends way less energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were gon na take turns in the lead. Yeah, well, it 's not my turn. Well, it 's not my turn either. JuJu, you take the lead. I 'm like, " Dudes, what happened to the plan? " You know, nobody wanted to do the work. Everybody 's just slowing down. You know, there 's an old saying in Nigeria : Is there no honor amongst blood diamond thieves? I think that applied in this case. No one would ride in front, so... so we were all competing to be in the back. Over the next seven days, the riders crawled across France, each unwilling to take the lead. Suffice it to say, during this section, the race was boring. Here we are, stage nine, the monotony continues. Now being passed by an old lady. Slim, you 've done an amazing job, riding slowest today. How are you holding up at this pace? You know, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to really stop and look around. Yeah, I mean, look where we are. It 's beautiful out here. Right. Sure. Yeah, so, what 's next for you? Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up, Rex. Hold up. Hold up. Hold up. Hey. That 's where I met Fabienne. Oh. Yeah, excuse me for one moment. I got ta see about something over here. Right. That 's Slim Robinson, taking a moment to really enjoy life. I totally understand what Slim did. Sometimes you just need a time-out. But the slow riding suddenly came to an end when a rowdy fan awoke a sleeping giant. What the fuck did you say to me? Today a man tell Gustav I can not ride fast, but I can ride very fast. - I will now field questions. - Gustav! Gustav, my question is, can you ride fast? Fuck you! Next question. Yeah, hi. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ride incredibly fast and prove all of you wrong! The race starts now! And Gustav Ditters making good on his promise. The race starts now. He is absolutely tearing up the Pyrenees like a man possessed. Even taking into account the past 10 days ' rest, this performance is off the charts! I do not know what has got into this guy. No one knew what had gotten into Gustav Ditters that day, but many suspected something had, literally. Setting records is standard protocol for the Tour de France, but when you blow records away and burn up a mountain at a pace most sprinters achieve on flat land, suspicions arise. Hey, come on. How do you beat a man on drugs if you 're not on drugs? Wait. Did you just admit to being on drugs? JuJu was n't the only one suspicious of Gustav 's new-found energy. Monsieur Ditters, we are police! It is not blood. It is not blood. It is Gatorade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gatorade! Give me the blood! Give me the blood! Blood doping. Most people are familiar with the term, but how exactly does it work? To understand doping, we must first understand the function of the red blood cell. Hi, I 'm a red blood cell, and it 's the most common type of blood cell in your body. That 's right, my boy! Our job is perhaps the most important in the bloodstream. We are the delivery men, delivering oxygen to all the cells of the body. We work alongside the other blood cells, like platelets... Hey-oh! Who are the construction men... Ow! And the white blood cells, who are the police force around here. He 's got a gun! What? Oh my God! He 's fucking dead! All right, calm... calm down. We were just doing our job. Pigs! Pigs! Let 's burn this motherfucker down! Kill these white motherfuckers! No! Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! Yeah, burn it down! Stop! We 're just attacking ourselves! It 's full-blown AIDS in here! The animator of the proceeding piece was a woman named Victoria Young. I was originally an animator for Sesame Street, but then I got fired from Henson, because I could n't draw fast enough. Sesame Street was also unhappy with my creation of the character Huey Black. Heya, Huey! Do you wan na play a numbers game? Shut the fuck up! Anyway, Gustav Ditters was blood doping, but not the way you 'd expect. Cyclists dope to get their VO2 max levels up, so Gustav figured, " Why not add red blood cells " from the creature with the highest VO2 max level on Earth? " A cheetah. Just because I have cheetah blood does not make me a cheetah! Cheetah. If I have cheetah blood in me, I am not cheetah, yeah? I was never a cheetah. The UCI should have understood that. If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make you a cheetah. What are you having trouble with? The way I say cheetah or the way I say " cheat-ah "? Whether it was effective or not, Gustav did add a foreign substance to his body. And for doing so, he was disqualified as a cheetah. And the following day, the field narrowed even further when JuJu Peppi took his fatal tumble off a cliff. Holy shit! - Oh man! - It ripped his dick off! People dope. Yeah. They risk their lives, but, you know, this is a sport with literally hundreds of dollars on the line, and dozens of fans. The... stakes are medium! By stage 14, Marty and Adrian were the only riders left in the race. Slim Robinson was still back on the outskirts of Marsan. I love it here. Stopping the race was the best decision I ever made. Just been working the farm with Fabienne. We produce dairy here... milk, yogurt and cheese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milking the cows, fucking the shit outta Fabienne. It just all really suited me. I still ride a bike every day, only now it 's to deliver our dairy. Only thing I 'm racing now is the expiration date on our milk. It should be noted, though, that I am probably the first black French dairy farmer. Number one, baby. Thus, unbeknownst to Marty, he found himself in cycling 's first battle of the sexes. It was just down to the... to the two of us, real competitive, uh, and then something weird happened. I started to notice, like, little things about him, and started to feel, like, " I want to get to know him better, " or something like that, and that was strange, ' cause I should 've been focused on winning. And I have to say, Marty and Adrian, really seem to be enjoying each other 's company out there. I think maybe Marty knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we go. Looks like we 're finally getting a race. No, they 're pulling over for a break. What the hell is this? If I did n't know that he was a she before we went behind that wall, jeez, I sure did after. - Oh yeah. Oh God. OUI! - Oh yeah. Oh man. Oui! Most hard-core cyclists know that cycling was invented so that men could fuck in the hills. I promised to keep her secret just between us, and in so doing, I became something of a gay icon. Marty and Adrian became the first publicly out gay athletes, while simultaneously being in a heterosexual relationship. Their romantic tryst was well-documented. Most beautifully covered by the French news channels. The way the French cover their sporting events is gorgeous. I 'll watch French sports all the time just to kinda brainstorm new ways of shooting things. Hey! The France 2 coverage of the 1982 Tour de France, it was n't just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call it groundbreaking footage for film, period. This was n't the French new wave. This was the French news wave. Do n't put that in the movie. That, um... It 's too good of a line. I want to get it right. This was n't the French new wave. It was the French news wave. That was it. We tied a rope to our bikes so... there would be no winners and there would be no losers. We would always be together. Well, to see Marty in the lead and in love made me so upset, because I hated Marty Hass. There. You talking about Marty Hass? Yes. Fuck Marty Hass! Fuck Marty Hass! Fuck him! Fuck him! Stage 19. Just two days remain and interest in the Tour has dwindled nearly to nothing. No spectators line the streets. Passing cars have absolutely no clue that an event of any kind is taking place. In fact, at this point, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I 'm just a guy on a bike following a homosexual couple who have tied their bikes together. And to no one 's surprise, Marty and Adrian shared the yellow jersey that day. Here we are, the beginning of the end of the 1982 Tour de France, the 187-kilometer ride from Fontenay-sous-Bois to the finishing line at the Champs-Elys? es. Excuse me a moment. Just getting word from the home office. Yeah? And just when you think it 's over, there 's some shit that 's about to go down. That 's bonkers! Well, some interesting new developments in the race. The UCI has just informed me that technically, since I 've ridden every stage of the race and had to register as a cyclist to bring my bike on the road, I 'm eligible to win this thing. What? And I think I just might. A perfect backflip from Rex! Whoa! And it 's a matching pair of tail whips from the lovebirds. Whoa-ho! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some reason. No! Adrian, what are you doing? It is the only way, Marty. We can do this together. No, you do it for us, Marty. I love you. Je t'aime. No! Adrian! Je t'aime! I had no fear when I ran into Rex, because my heart was just so full, full of love for Marty. I could feel nothing else. In fact, I could feel nothing at all, because I was also on... very much... Oxycodone. Whoa! The dude was a chick! Adrian Baton is, in fact, a woman. Well, that moment really set the groundwork for a whole genre of cross-dressing sports films... Just One of the Guys, Nobody 's Perfect, Ladybugs, Juwanna Ma... Juwanna Mann is, I think, one of the best films. It 's arguably the best film. And that 's not all. It appears Rex Honeycut was riding with an engine in his bike. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pros. It was all Marty, all alone, heading into Paris. It was... it was heartbreaking to try to go it alone, but I had to try to win for Adrian... otherwise her sacrifice would 've been for nothing. An African was going to win the Tour de France! And for a brief moment... I loved Marty Hass. And here 's Marty Hass approaching the finish line. He will be the champion of the 1982... Wait! What 's this? Ladies and gentlemen, Slim Robinson is back! Even though life on the farm was perfect, I could n't get cycling out of my head. Slim is moving at an incredible pace on his cruiser! He 's caught up to Marty! But now it 's Marty giving a strong push! Ladies and gentlemen, we are in for an incredible finish! They are absolutely neck and neck right now! Getting closer! Getting closer! This is one for the record books! And the winner is... Slim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the other angle, but no, it was not close at all. Those defocused lenses can be really deceiving. I still get emotional when I think about it. I mean, I was the first black man in the Tour de France, and I won it. This is the most important shit that has ever happened ever! Fuck Jackie Robinson, and fuck Marty Hass with his fake African ass! Guess what else? I can make cheese, yo! I make some good cheeses. Was I happy that a black man won the Tour de France? This is the first I 'm hearing about it. Somehow, Marty Hass found a way to fuck us over again. You know, I think it 's a bit of a shame that... that an African could n't have won that race. It was a very fucked up year for bicycle riding. Cyclists are hunks. I still really do n't love watching cycling. With the upper body of an alien and the downstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' 82 Tour were the characters. With only five guys, you really got to know each of them. You really cared. It was just super strong character development, and the whole thing, like, really played out, like, a really well-written script. I won the Tour de France, and I did it with nothing but my own blood, sweat, and tears, and extra blood! Oh shit. It was a tough day. Lost the race, lost my girl, and I have n't seen Adrian since. No, I never, uh... I never did see Marty again. Um, my crashing into Rex was considered manslaughter, since he died, you know? And for this, I received... 35 years in prison, so... It was worth it... because I did what I set out to do. I proved that a woman can cheat at cycling as well as any man. That 's something for people to think about from this anonymous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ van, but they did n't know the bike was stolen. And then one day, I 'm just riding to school, and then I 'm getting the living shit beat out of me. And that 's what it 's like in Africa. Like, sometimes they 'll run out of Nerds candy. Have you ever had that? I was like, " Where 's my Nerds? - Where 's my Nerds? " - A Nerds shortage in Africa? Right. Yeah, because they got ta ship ' em in, and I 'm like, " Dad! Where 's my Nerds? " I 'm not a milkman. I 'm a cyclist. You 're not taking this bike! You tell Slim 's uncle Slim is back on the Tour! Who is that? Jackie fucking Robinson! Big news at the Tour de France, a fight has broken out, and not surprisingly, Austrian muscle freak Gustav Ditters is in the center of it. Here we have some footage of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kick other riders in the face. Stupendous. I 'm Mick Porterhouse and... Woo! Oh no! My legs are getting all shaky, man! Hey, hey, hey. Slow down, man. He ca n't take that. Take it easy on him! I think I 'm gon na evacuate my bowels! Just go with it, Marty! Ride the wave! That is not helping, Slim! Call my Dad! Basta! Call my Dad, man! Call his-a papa! After that... I rocked a trifecta, and I passed out. Oh, cool, yeah. Oh, that 's when you, um, puke and shit and jizz at the same time. What 's a basketball player look like? We do n't have that in Napa. That 's a basketball player? Jesus! That makes me even hornier than the picture of a cyclist. Oh my shit, he is fine! What the fuck is in his shorts? That was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of electricity. It was... felicity. When you put a crazy person in charge of the Tour de France, crazy things will happen. That was Ditmer Perten. Was that " Perten "? That was Ditman Kirkman. That was Ditmar Perper. I mean, how the fuck do you say this guy 's name? What was his name again? That was Ditman Klerker. That was Ditman Klerken. That was Ditmar Klerken. Ditmen Klirken. Ditman Klerker... Klerken. Ditmen Klerken. Ditman Klerker. Ditmen Klerken. Did I get it? Ditmen Klerken. Ditmen Klerken. That 's his name, okay. But he was crazy, though. Well, Tour 's over. Time to go kill myself.
