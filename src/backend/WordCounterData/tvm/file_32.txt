No strength left to get back home. Where am I to go? I just want to have a nice meal and rest in peace. What a cursed girl I was. Bringing bad harvest and drought as my dowry. Bringing bad harvest and drought as my dowry. It 's all my fault. Oh, how endless the scolding was. The life I had was not a life, indeed. Are Eun-young 's wedding plans going well? Of course. I 'm taking good care of everything. Do a good job in place of Ma, okay? Do n't worry. Take out the weeds not the precious ginseng. Oh no! You had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me see that. Never mind. Oh, Ma came out. Mother, you should stay inside. It 's not like there 's anything better to do with my body. Plus, I 'm still pretty darn strong. I better work hard to avoid being named a lazy old hag. Nothing compares to Ma 's noodles. Of course not. Mother, you want to go to Eun-young 's wedding, right? How many years has it been since you had motion sickness? I fainted the year I turned forty. Try counting the years since. I spent too much energy giving birth to Eun-young at my old age. Ma, could n't you just act crazy clench your teeth and get in the car? Just close your eyes and ride it out? Are you saying that because you really do n't know? My head spins the second my foot is off the ground. Anyway, I just hope the wedding goes well. It does n't matter if I go or not. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say anything but I can see that Eun-young wants you to be there. Do n't worry. Mother, I 'll be extra careful. Dead or alive, your dad was always the only one that had it easy... Our little girl is getting married. Excuse me, ma'am. ma'am, do you have some water by any chance? Standing under the blazing sun all day is making me thi rsty. Wow, that 's great. It 's ice cold. You saved my life. Thanks, ma'am. Is n't it hard to stand like that all day?... You know how all sorts of things happen in life? Just think of it like that and laugh it off. Why do you look so tired? Are you all right? It 's a long story. Oh, I see. No matter how dizzy you feel that 's just how the world is. Then you can just walk. It 's simple. Just walk to the wedding. But it 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all downhill after the first step. Let 's just walk there. I wonder if I could do it... I 've never walked so far... Nam In-su/ A serenede of sorrow Where did you say you were going for your honeymoon? I remember you telling me but I forgot. Cambodia. Eun-young, are you really going to Cambodia for your honeymoon? Is there anything to see? Is n't it just full of mine fields? Huh? Mine fields? We 're going backpacking in Angkor Wat. A friend of mine went there last year on her honeymoon. According to what she said it seems pretty cheap and fun. That must be so great, Eun-young. I wonder when I 'll ever get to travel abroad... Honey, we should plan a trip overseas sometime. That 's some spoiled talking. Then when will we pay off all our debts? That is n't always the case. You can do it for a couple hundred bucks, if you look around. - Really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat Mother Jae-young and Ja-myung to China. You get to travel to China thanks to Yong-tae, Mother. Are n't you happy? Of course. Let 's travel and benefit from having a good son-in-law. - You have to keep that promise. - Do n't worry. Big brother helped out a lot with the wedding dowry. - Aw, it was nothing. - Better make a lot of money. - have some more. - Thanks. Talk is good and all, but how is Mother going to travel anywhere? It 's like having a license without a car. Watch your tongue. Mother, I think dinner 's all ready... Learn to be patient and try to make things work in your new life. Do n't worry about me, Mom. I 'll be fine. You must be disappointed about missing the wedding. It 's okay... I 'm sorry. I should 've had it nearby... Do n't say that. I do n't want to ruin one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the in-laws would n't have been happy about it either. Hey, scratch my back. Come on, you old hag. Get up and scratch my back. Well? Scratch my back already. It 's driving me nuts. What are you doing here? I mean, you 're dead. I came to see if you 're cheating on me. You know what they say about widows... you 're not seeing any old farts, are you? Who knows if you have n't been up to something in the afterlife. They say that even when womanizers die they die near the fences of a whorehouse. What a mouth. You did great... even through the bad times. Do you even know? I 'm rotting away on the inside. all the more reason to go to that wedding even if you have to walk there. Mother, are you up? Did you have a dream? There 's food, right? Bring some over. That 's why I 'm asking you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Anyway, you must be exhausted from walking all those miles. It 's not some big deal... So, you 're telling me that she 's walking to the wedding? Yes, that 's what I 'm saying. She 's really determined to do so. I do n't think just stopping her will be the solution. Jae-young, do you think her body can handle that? If she received Marine training before she leaves, but otherwise... I still think it would be too much for her. Mother is a lot more determined than she looks. I 'm flat out against it. It 's absolute nonsense. It 's freaking far from here to Mokpo. And she 's gon na walk all the way there? I 'm telling you it was no use trying to stop her. You know how stubborn she can get. So you did n't talk her into it? If Mother walks to Mokpo I 'll have to walk beside her. Why would I dig my own grave? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many days do you think it 'll take for her to get there? Either way, she 'll barely make it. If only she had decided beforehand. But even if she leaves tomorrow she 'll have to walk well over 16km per day. My goodness, 16km? What if she collapses or gets sick on the way? We might end up holding a funeral instead of a wedding. Honey, watch what you 're saying... Anyway, it 's going to be one heck of a walk. She 's suddenly become Mao Ze-dong. Now that 's what you call a painful march. Nevertheless, I do n't think anything will stop her... Did she mention why she has to be at the wedding? Since she got back from a temple. Something she wants to give to Eun-young herself, I hear. And what 's that? Since Grandma ca n't ride cars because of her dizziness, We can just think up a different method. I think a helicopter would do the trick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ever get one? It ca n't be cheap to rent one for sure. Why do n't we go to the closest dock and take a boat? Now, make yourself comfortable Ma. - I ca n't take this anymore. - Ma. - I 'm dying here... - Ma! I 'm dying... Captain, turn the boat around. Hurry up and turn around. The boat is out, because the waves make her queasy. Dad, ca n't you carry her on your back? Carry her on my back? You know, with the Marine spi rit! That 's right. If becoming a Marine were easy I would never have volunteered. Even Hemingway once said that should he ever encounter impending danger, he would want none other than a Marine by his side... ' Who is that man ' ' standing fearlessly in the middle of the vast ocean? ' ' He is a Marine. ' ' Evil has no power in the presence of a Marine. ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I 'm sorry, but please put me down. Maybe if we give her sleeping pills or anesthesia She 'll be there before she knows it... It 's going to be difficult. Considering your age, It 's dangerous to take sleeping pills let alone anesthesia. How about a carriage? Now, what are you doing blocking the way? Ma, is n't this great? you 're flying like a bird! Oh my... Like a bird? My ass. I 'm dying here. I 'm gon na throw up. This is n't working. Hey, hurry and take us down. Ma 's dying. Dear, let 's get going. She 'll be done with her hair by now. Just know that Mother and I are leaving tomorrow. - Goodbye. - See You later. Okay, let 's get going. I really think We 're pushing the limit here. I mean, I understand better than anyone how you feel, But you should n't do this. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way you can make it. What are you doing? Take her back home. What are you gon na do if she gets sick? We were n't disappointed that you could n't come to our wedding. Ma... Gracious were there this many scarecrows? Is the family going on an outing ma'am? You must be so tired. I 'm on my way to the wedding in Mokpo. So you finally decided to walk there? That 's great. If I take it step by step, I 'm sure we 'll be there before the wedding. Then I 'll see you when you get back. Hold on a second. It 's hot outside so you should take this. No, it 's okay. You do n't have to do this... Thank you, ma'am. It ' s only a parasol. Look at all these flowers. Did you plant all these? Well... You know that you 'll meet all sorts of people on the road. I promise to return this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sick of playing a scarecrow? It 's sad to watch. There 's no way you can understand me. Do you really believe this will change anything? How will people ever understand my amazing sublimity? It 's going to be a long journey so take care of your mother. But... Where have all those sparrows gone? you 're relentless. Why are you making these scarecrows anyway? To avoid being lonely. Even if everyone leaves this way I wo n't be lonely. I have no idea what you 're talking about. Is it good? you 're right? Do you really have to go? What are you saying? I 'm just saying that the road is very harsh... Do n't say useless things. My precious child is getting married. And after all I learned how to read and write at this old age thanks to Eun-young... F-a-t-h-e-r is... Like before? Going? Going home. Good job Mom. The way I see it you have the smarts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school. Oh, hush... someone might hear you. Being illiterate is nothing to brag about. Mom, it 's nothing to be ashamed of. You know they say that learning is for a lifetime. Who cares if people know? Hey everybody! My mom is learning to read and write! Gracious. Still, it 's embarrassing so lower your voice. - Oh, all right. - Someone might hear. Let 's start from here again. Beautiful sky! There 's a lot of dragonflies around here. But it 's a worrysome. Lots of dragonflies means it 's gon na rain soon. - Oh no. - We better hurry. Gee, who told you that kind of stuff. Whoa, since you 've become literate at your age, you 've become so smart. Ma, over here! Let 's go this way Ma. Mountains and people alike everything gets winkled with age. Ma, can I ask you something? What do you need to give Eun-young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should n't have brought it up in the first place. You can just whisper it to me. Really, it 's nothing. - Are you done? - Where are you coming from? I just went to see the mayor of the village. - The mayor, for what? - we need to sleep, right? I asked around and thankfully he offered us the town hall. - How thoughtful of him. - That 's good. Mother, is the walking okay? Ja-myung said, it 's like a picnic I 'm having a pretty good time. We can use a shortcut tomorrow We 're taking the mountain course. - Will that be okay with you? - That 's actually great. It would be much better than walking on hard cement. Plush soil is the easiest to walk on. Ma, what are you doing? It 's okay. I 'll do it. Ma! your second son Dae-yong is home. Ja-myung? Hyo-eun? Gun-hoo? Grandma, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later. What are they? Sunglasses. That 's just a toy for children. - Will you hand me my cell phone? - Yes. Try it on. I 'll escort Mom until sunset. You both really should rest. - You do n't need to. - But, how? all I have to do is follow the road. Yeah, but today 's route is all hills and mountains. Come on, Jae-young If mom can do it, I 'm sure I can. Hello? Jae-young, it 's me. Where are you? I 'm downtown right now. I heard you 're accompanying Ma. Sure sounds like our Ma. How can I miss Eun-young 's wedding. I heard that you already left with her. Why are you bringing that up? Okay, do n't worry. So where are you now? Where? What would you like? Take off the stem of a watermelon pour some honey over it. Take out the seeds. Would you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't. Then what would you like? Perhaps a pear instead? No, I do n't want that either. Ma, I 'm here. Bo-hyun, your uncle is here. Ja-myung! Do I have to keep wearing these? I feel stuffy. well then, You can take them off and give them to me. Yeah... but they were our baby 's present... They 're just toys. Here, give them to me. - Dae-yong, just wait a second. - Why? What are you carrying that around for? This? I brought this because of Ma. I thought you might feel lonely. It should be okay about here pretty quiet. You ready? I figured Ma might be bored on her walk so I recorded some oldies? You know Ma 's a big fan of Nam In-su. What a surprise. Ma, you got a great son here. Let 's get going. Is n't it good? Hey, it 's this way. Really? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastic. - Are you sure? - There 's no other way? If we do n't go this way it 'll take longer. I did n't know it either. Holy crap! What are you doing? Do n't come near me. Come here, Ma. - I almost burst. - that must feel good. How about you, Ma? Do n't need to pee? It 's okay. Damn, it 's hard to go to a wedding. Who would believe this? Oh, man... Are you sure there 's no other way? Jae-young said we wo n't even make it if we go around. We have to go across this to get to the wedding. What a life this is... Ma, just try to get over. Just close your eyes. That 's exactly what I 'm doing... Are we there yet?... I 'm dying here... Did Jae-young have any clue... It 's killing you, Mom. Ma, just pretend, this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are we doing? It 's hopeless. Eun-young, my baby... Your mother 's dying here. Ma, are you all right? Hang on. Why is it so shaky? - Let 's get it together now. - Ma, hang on. Hang on, just a little bit. Hello? Eun-young... Okay dear... Let ' s rest a little bit. - Ma, let 's have a break. - Well... You better be good to Mom. Look at the trouble she 's putting herself through. Yes, hang on. I 'll pass it on to Ma. Mom, it 's Eun-young. Right... - Hello. - Mom. Hello? Yes, it ' s Mom... Why are you crying all of a sudden? Now I 'm getting all teary-eyed... Honey, please do n't cry. Mom, why did you have me? It was n't me. Your horny dad just would n't let me sleep at night. Do n't cry too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. It 's tough for you, is n't it? I 'm fine, so do n't worry. I 'm serious. Stop crying. Jesus, look at you. you 're too thin. Just look at you. From all of those troubles of being on your own. Look at your legs how thin they are. You poor thing. Stay here while I check ahead. I do n't know anything not anything. Do n't ask me cause I have n't got a clue. Suede... suede... boots. They are only for the Marines. - You 're all tense. - That feels good. Ma, I 'm your favorite, right? Mother, how are you holding up? - Are You hurt anywhere? - I am just fine And dandy. How are you doing, honey? Was it decent to walk? Although the heat was aggravating... like Ja-myung said it was a great picnic. Good job. How about you, Dae-yong? Easy walk? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Young-chul 's wedding I 'm gone. That 's for sure. You were n't too bad for an alcoholic... Jae-young... Just one more day left, huh? You did good today. Go home and rest up. - You too, Gi-young. - Yes? - Thanks. - No, it was nothing. I wish you all the best. I 'll see you at the wedding, sir. Victory! Dae-yong, do n't fight with Jae-young on the way. What am I, a child? I 'm not gon na fight. Quit nagging and go home already. - Okay, We 're leaving. - Sure. - Drive safely. - We 're leaving. Where are you going? Are n't you gon na sleep? A man 's got ta do what a man 's got ta do. That does n't answer my question. I 'm just gon na have a few cups of booze. to get all this dust out of my mouth. It needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me, ma'am can you give us a better appetizer? What would you like to order? Give us some of that marinated chicken. Coming right up. The only thing that has n't changed with you is that obsession with chicken. Oh, damn. Why are you grumbling about someone else 's taste? I 'm just a little frustrated you hopeless idiot. Are n't you embarrassed to face your brothers and sisters? you 're over forty for crying out loud so start acting your age. What are you gon na do about it? Are n't you gon na pour me some? What are you saving your own hands for? Your wife 's breasts? Or maybe they 're for the ass. Hey, that 's funny. I 'm an idiot for trying. Come here, everbody. What the hell is this? Ugh. Shit. I 'm completely screwed. I do n't think it 's going to stop raining anytime soon. Mother, what should we do? Hey, should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should at least watch that while it rains. Then should I call a coffee shop and order coffee? Ma, you want some tea? Mother, let 's head back now. You 've come far enough Mom. Get up, we have to go eat. You got ta have a good breakfast if you want to walk all day today. Come on. Are your ears just for decoration? You can have it, mom. I ca n't finish it anyway... it 's too much. Did you drink a lot last night? I just wanted a glass of Makgulli to wash out my mouth Thanks to Jae-young nagging the heck out of me. Did I pour it down your throat? You drank it with your own two hands. You disrespectful asshole, you ca n't even reason between fact and fiction. Why are you two bickering over a meal... Jae-young, will we arrive in Mokpo today, if we walk all day? Yes, I think it 'll nearly be enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even tell what 's right in front of you... and that 's life. So how do you know what 's going to happen tonight? Especially, considering how the rain wo n't stop. What the hell are you hitting me for? Even dogs are left alone during a meal... and you hit me with a spoon? You dare raise your voice to me? Do I need to slap you around for you to get some sense back? Sure, go ahead and try me. Make my day. What the heck are you two doing? Are you trying to test my patience? This is just great with a family event coming up and all. Just forget about everything. What did I do to deserve this? If you two want to fight, go ahead. It 's all useless, so forget it and do whatever you want. you 're the same, Mom. Why are you putting everyone through so much trouble? What are you talking about? I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking like crazy all the way to Mokpo... and it 's making me boil with anger that 's all - Goodness. - What are you trying to say? You, just shut your mouth. I 'm doing this all for you, Mom. you 're saying this out of concern, are you? You worthless bastard. Mom, I 'm sorry. Please calm down. Let 's get you out of the rain. Mom, I 'm sorry. I wo n't go, then... I just wo n't go... Come on Mom. you 're not mad, are you? You ca n't give up now after all that... Ma. Ma! Excuse me. Let me have some more Kimchi here. Damn, that 's good. Ma, I 'm so sorry. Ma? Ma. Mother. What are you doing? Ma, are you okay? My shoes are all ruined. Are you sure you 're okay? - And they 're expensive one's too. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink. A glass or two is good for ya. This is Bae Ho, right? Wow, how did you know? His voice sure was nice back in the day. Shame that he died so early. Oldies sure are the best are n't they? They just touch you in such a way... Music these days do n't sound Korean anymore. It 's impossible to understand what they ' re singing. That 's the truth. Good music needs... its joys and sorrows and has to touch someone 's heart. You should become sorry for yourself but then the song should pick you back up. That 's what music is. Wow, our Mom is a genius. Where did you learn that fancy talk? No one taught me... Some things you just learn as you go. You think Ma is ignorant like you? You just keep saying stupid things. Here we go again. Why do you always have a problem with me? Would it hurt to listen to Mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wonder what our Yeon-hwa is doing. I wonder if she 's thinking of me. Mother... I 'm sorry. That wretched girl. She does n't even deserve to die. She does n't even need Ma. What am I, now? What am I? Ma, what 's wrong? You lose something? What did you lose? Mom, did you lose money or something? But your hands were empty. Come on. Look carefully. No... It 's no big deal... Tell us what it is. It 's hard to think straight with you two fighting! ma'am, the rain must have made it harder for you. What brings you here? I said I 'd return the favor so I 'm here to keep my promise. Looking for this? Oh my, where did you find this? It dropped when you were putting on the raincoat. How did you know... Amazing reality! Strange things happen in life you know? well then, I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the village for his missing bike. Oh, one more thing... Would it be okay if I attended the wedding? Oh, of course. After all, you did find this for me. Well... Ma, have a seat. It 's nice and cool. Wanted/ PARK Dae-yong Ma, you want some cold water? Sure. Bring us over a glass of cold water here. Did n't you have to go? That 's why we came, right? It 's okay... What? I thought you were just dying to go... You keep holding it in and it 'll turn on you. Hurry on over and let it out. It 's not easy for me either, okay? I 'm doing it for the good of the family. What in the world is he talking about? Come on Ma. Let 's go. We got a long way ahead and the water is bad here. - Hurry up. - Okay, okay. Let 's go Ma. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something wrong? You should n't sin... Look at me I ca n't even shit when I want to. How did I end up like this... It does n't look too bad. - No, I do n't think I can. - I 'll try going in first. - Oh No, son. - Do n't worry Ma. - Stop! Do n't go in! - Water is my buddy. - Goodness gracious. - It 's all right, Ma. You go and rest over there. - It 's not so bad. - It 's very deep. - Are you sure? - Yeah. It does n't even come up to my waist. Oh my goodness. Son! Jae-young! Oh no. Son! My baby! Jae-young! Ma. Ma! Hey, big brother! Ma! Ma! Ma! Hold on, Ma. Come on. Jae-young. It does n't look that bad. Let 's just try it. Contestant number one! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely colors. These red and blue one's look like the ducks on old marriage beds and the yellow one's look like baby chicks. But... here I am old and withering. You think I 'm pretty? Each wrinkle on my forehead is like each of your petals? You want to congratulate my daughter 's wedding? Why, you flowers are pretty inside and out. Take care. Seems it was too much for her after all. Mom, are you okay? What do you mean? Mom, it 's hot out, huh? It 's so hot today, I 'm going crazy. I can only imagine how bad it must be for you. It 's okay, so do n't hide it and tell me what 's wrong. Tel I you what? What am I hiding? Well, before... with the flowers, Ma. Never mind. It 's nothing. Ma... Ma.... Just thinking about your dad makes me laugh. I wonder why he was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just keeps on falling over Samgakji Rotary... You like me that much, eh? Do n't make a fuss in the middle of the street... I just need to pee over here. you 're the prettiest lady in the whole world. Why is n't it coming out? The rain keeps falling over the rotary... Damn. Why is Dad 's death so funny, ma? You do n't think it 's funny? I think it 's hilarious. Which way is it? Does n't anyone have a clue? Why are you so disgusting? It 's this way. Ma, over here. Come on, let 's go. It 's this way. That way is... Let 's just follow her. What 's that? Mok-Po 16km San-Yi 0.5km That says Mokpo, right? Yes, We 're almost there now. It 's weird to see you read so good. all thanks to Eun-young. She came over every weekend to teach me. Ma, let 's keep it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't this Young-ok? How long has it been? Let me hug my beautiful little sister. Hey, you dumb idiot... what are you doing to a nun? What 's going on here? Were you waiting for us the whole time? I sure was. Since before sunset. How did you know that we were coming this way? Someone told you, did n't they? Who 'd ya talk to? Buddha came to me in my dreams last night. I just ca n't understand her... She was the smartest and prettiest out of all of us,... so why in the world did she become a Buddhist nun? You know something about it Jae-young? No. I went with Ma once in high school because I got suspended. I could n't even stand one day. What 's so great about it? What do you think Jae-young? I do n't know. Anyway, do you think it 's true that Buddha told her in her dreams? You think she lied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man, you 're damn annoying. No response whatsoever. Why do you have to be so uptight? Holy shit. I just thought of my card, okay? Happy now? What card? You idiot you 're a rotten thief. I should ' ve called the cops on you that time. You were lucky you were my brother. Who steals from their brother? Huh? Steal his credit card and took out 3 million Won? Three grand is a lot of money. - Do you even have a clue? - I have no idea. They did n't make credit cards so fools like you could go out and use them. Why do n't you use your head for once? Use your head outside the barbershop too. It 's not a freaking paper weight. It 's there for a reason. So how long has it been since you became a nun? Six years now. It 's been that long? Life is like a jar of honey saved up for special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gone before you even know it. Your words sound a little discouraging. If you think about it life is just a sad journey. Although it 's stupid wasting time fighting over little things, You bet there are people out there fighting even now. Do you know how much I missed you? I prayed to Buddha so many times. I always asked that he keep my Young-ok healthy, over and over again. At least if you were in prison I could visit you... I 'm afraid I 'll bother you being here. Do you have any idea how hard it is to stop seeing you? Mother... Mom, I 'm sorry... How can I even ask for forgiveness? I thought it was supposed to be like that. Toli ing in the fields all day, freezing your hands doing the laundry in winter, and not taking care of yourself. I just thought that 's the way things were. You miss Grandma, do n't you. When you said you miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying one night crouching in the corner. I realized then that things were n't supposed to be that way. It took too long to figure it out. I now know that you 're the Buddha in me. No. I never said it but I was always so proud of you that you had become a nun. Not everyone can devote their life to Buddha. Young-ok. Once in my childhood, my mother licked a splinter out of my eyes. It felt so much better. Your grandma just loved those persimmons. She would joke and tell me to bury her under a persimmon tree. I can still feel the touch of her cheeks on my fingertips. Young-ok, do you know how I felt when I got the call? If her eyes were closed I would say, ' Ma, just rest and go to Dad. ' ' Then you wo n't have to hurt anymore. ' But I ran to her and the moment I saw her face, I begged her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how she could leave so sudden. I still felt like she 'd be smiling there if I turned around. Young-ok, In the next life I hope your Grandma and I could switch places. I 'd give her everything and make up for the things I could n't give in this life. Young-ok I do n't know if you 'll understand. In this world my mother was like a mi rror to me. Mom, this is the Youngsan River Haguwon embankment. Impressive, is n't it? I only heard about it. first time I 'm seeing it. Just like they said it 's freaking big. Mom, We 're finally here. As soon as we cross the embankment it 's Mokpo. Mom, you did well. I 'm so proud of you You did good, Ma. You too, big brother. Ma, Ma, let 's go. Even if it hails, even if it rains even if the apocalypse is upon us let 's go. Go! Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ma, all the cars passing by making you dizzy? I 'm okay as long as I do n't look.

Looking at daddy he says ' Mommy, ' looking at the road he says ' Mommy, ' ' Mommy ' at the mountain ' Mommy ' at the fields, ' Mommy ' at the Poplar tree at the side of the road. Even at the wind that blows in between he yells ' Mommy, Mommy... ' Sitting atop a boulder he cries ' Mommy, Mommy... ' Even at the stream flowing by the river he cries ' Mommy, Mommy... '
