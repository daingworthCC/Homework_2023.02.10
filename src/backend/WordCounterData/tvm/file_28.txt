5214041 Voice : Oh, no! Here we go! I told you! It 's started. Meow. Cat : Aunt Hilda, Aunt Zelda, come quick! There 's trouble in Sabrina 's room. Cat : Come on! Meow! Oh, no, Hilda. Good night. We 've got to get her down before she hurts herself on the roof beams. Salem, you were supposed to be watching her! First we have to move her over the bed. Okay, but careful Do n't wake her up. Sail softly down, like a feather borne, down safe to bed to greet the morn. You know, her powers are certainly beginning to bud. As long as they do n't bloom before the full moon. [sneezes] Mmm. You are so good at that, Zelda. Well, we all have our strengths. Maybe we could give her a teensy hint - just so she 's -- - Perish the thought. Do you want her to start off with a strike against her from the Council? The rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know until the full moon after her 16th birthday, and then we can tell her. I know. Shh! Zelda : I just hope she does n't have a conniption when she finds out. - A what? - You know, freak. Radio : It 's a beautiful sunny day in Riverdale today. Weexpecthighsabout 70 degrees. You'relisteningto WITC radio on your A.M. dial. Comingup, an oldie but goody. Did something strange happen last night? No. What 's wrong? Why do you ask? Well, it 's just so weird. Did someone rearrange my furniture while I was sleeping? What? My bed moved at least three feet. Well, maybe we had an earthquake. We do n't get earthquakes in Riverdale. Nope, in case you did n't notice, I 've been here three months, and nothing ever happens in Riverdale. Besides, Salem would have warned us. Would n't you, Salem? Everybody knows cats are psychic. [laughs] They are? Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a special cat. I had the strangest dream last night. Really, dear? What about? Well, I dreamt I was flying. I was high above the town just floating. Oh, I used to have that same dream when I was - - [thump] when I was dreaming. Which I do n't anymore. Hilda : Well, whatever. Talking about dreams... Did you ever have the one where you realized you were late for class? Do n't wig. I 'm going. I 'm going. - Here. - Thanks. - Bye. - Bye. Bye. [purring] Sometimes I think there 's something very odd about those two. Do n't you, Salem? [meows]? [hip-hop]?? Well, I 'm the mac daddy on the left-hand side...? [chattering] Mondo styling boots, man. Those are cool. Thanks. What 's up? Do I seem different to you? Taller. No, I 'm serious. Do you ever feel like you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man. Every day of the week. [bell_ringing] I mean that there was something really wrong with you. Like I had a disease or something weird? No, not a disease. Just something... different. Well, look, why do you think that they have a counselor here at school? Everybody thinks they 've got a problem. We 're the troubled youth of today. I mean, my parents ca n't wait until I go away to college and come back human. Hey, Sabrina. Hey, Harvey. How 's it going? Good. Hey, what happened to you? What? I do n't know. You seem different. Hey, was it something I said? Yeah. Nice. [grunting] You 've got style, Harvard. Anyone ever tell you that? All the time. - You got it? - Yes, I have it. Ethics 101. You 're going to get a B+ on this paper. I knew I could count on you. Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's get out of here. Seth, he 's a sophomore. Well, no one 's perfect. Whatever. Just look at her. Miss Best, All-World, Katy Lemore. Really, who says? Her own imagination. Whoa. Tres great foliage. I 've got stuff growing out of my locker, too, but I think it 's mold from an avocado sandwich, or something. You must have a secret admirer. Shh. You 're the only one who knows it 's my birthday. Your birthday. Right, right. Your birthday 's on the 27th, and that would make it today. Happy birthday. Thanks. Let 's go to class. Yeah. [bell_rings] [whistle_blowing] Focus, please, ladies. Keep your eye on the ball. Sorry, Miss Jones. Check that out, Sabrina. Seth? He 's okay, I guess. Okay? Come on. He 's more than okay. [whistle_blowing] [grunting] [laughing] You guys okay? - Whoops. - Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys, keep the pace. I 'm dumping Seth. What? I thought you two were madly in love. We are. Am I missing something? Fran, you 're so naive when it comes to I'amour. Huh? Matters of the heart. A stagnant relationship is doomed to failure. I just want to keep him on his toes. Hey. So, where 's the party? Party? Well, I 'm invited, right? We 're pals, are n't we? So who 's it for? Sabrina. Sabrina? Oh, you mean that good-looking transfer student, right. Right. Where 's Katy? You did n't hear? We broke up. I 'm a free man. Hey, Mr. Dingle! Hi, girls. [engine_starts] Marnie, do you believe in magic? Well, the first time Bobby Peterson kissed me, it was magic. Of course, I got nauseous and felt like I was gon na hurl, but... That 's not what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the supernatural. You mean like astral projection and channeling and the Psychic Network? Sort of. I mean, let me ask you this. Are the aliens really the one's who built the pyramids? Come on, I 'm serious. Sure. Absolutely positively not. Anybody here? I 'm home. Great, they 've forgotten my birthday. Hmm. Well, there 's always pizza. Sure. All : Surprise! What? Surprise, sweetheart! Surprise, sweetheart! You should 've seen the look on your face. Happy birthday, Sabrina! Look, we even have enough food. Look at this. Food! Food. This is great. You 're the best. Actually, I know I 'm incredible, but this was all Harvey 's idea. Harvey 's? Yeah, I just thought it would be a nice way for you to make some new friends. That was really sweet. Forgot my birthday. Really, Sabrina. Yeah, it was nothing. Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're both really something. They 're something, all right. Harvey! Your nachos are burning. I 'll be right back. This party just hit the big time. - What? - It 's Seth. Well, obviously we were expected. Cool. Okay, he is sort of cute. Oh, cute. Come on, Sabrina. You 're sixteen, now. This guy is n't cute. He 's a man. [laughing] Anyway, have a good time. This is a great party, Harvey. You 're - - You 're a genius. She 's having a great time. Yeah, well, she 's a great kid. A kid? Come on. In case you have n't noticed, she 's not really a kid anymore. I 've noticed. Yeah, it 's so obvious.? [rock]?? Do n't ask no questions?? I 've got no answers?? I 've never felt this way before?? We 've both got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, happy birthday. I 'm Seth. I know. So, how do you like Riverdale so far? Things are definitely looking up. You noticed. Listen up! Who wants to play pin the tail on the donkey? What is this, some kind of time warp, or something? Hey, lady, this is n't 3rd grade. Maybe it would be fun. Yeah. Yeah, maybe it 'd be cool. Right? Yeah, I guess. Harvey : Hey, can I help at all? Yeah, thanks, Harvey. Could you hold this? Okay, turn around. [laughing] [phone_dialing] [phone_ringing] [phone_ringing] Yes? It 's Fran. You 'll never believe this. What? Seth is here at Sabrina 's party. I ca n't believe it. What 's he doing there? He 's playing pin the tail on the donkey, and he looks like he 's having a good time. [engine_starts] If anyone tries to steal him from me, they 're dead meat. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who 's there? You 're not even close. Wrong again. Could you please move? Say pretty please. Pretty please with sugar on top. I do n't think it 's going to work. What did I tell you? You were n't even close. Have you two met? Sabrina, this is Katy. Katy, this is Sabrina. Charmed. Likewise. It 's Sabrina 's birthday. Oh, really? I would never have guessed. Sweet 16. [CD_skipping] Oh, what 's happening to the CD player? Katy, have a hat. Join the festivities. It goes on you head. Okay, sweetheart. - Coming through. - Excuse me.? For she 's a jolly good fellow?? For she 's a jolly good fellow?? For she 's a jolly good fellow?? Which nobody can deny? [cheering] Happy birthday! Make a wish, sweetheart. And blow out the candles. That 's good. Keep going, keep going. You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Good. Nice one. Look. Somebody... Excuse me. You jerk! I 'm soaked! I 'm sorry, but you were on fire! I saved you life. You hair was burning. I thought it was important to you. And I just thought I was helping. Yes, you did. Thanks, Harvey. Are you okay? No thanks to you. Are you coming? Well, no. I thought I was a free man. Suit yourself. Well, um... Who wants cake? So, did you have a good birthday? It was great. You know that friend of yours, Katy? She 's really quite the comedian. She 'll do anything for a laugh. A real hot-head. Yeah, she 's something, all right. It was the strangest thing. I thought that -- You know, your parents called today from Sri Lanka. More cake? I ca n't believe I missed them. Did you get a number? Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're on the move, anyway. Next stop, Venice They 'll call again. We know you miss them, sweetheart. They sent their love. Hey, Sabrina, look on the bright side. They 're halfway through their sabbatical. I do n't know what I 'd do without you two. Ah, well, we 're just glad we could be here to guide you through your special time. My special time? Your birthday. She means your special birthday. Your special present. My special present? Well, where is it? Well, it has n't arrived yet. Your parents mailed it, and you know how the mail is. They are always so slow. But do n't fret, I have a feeling it will be here any day now. If it gets here at all. Oh, it 'll get here, all right. [owl_hooting] [meows] [purring] [footsteps] [creaking] [cover_closing] " For Sabrina, Happy 16th. " To be opened only under the full moon. Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. It 's blank. [door_opening] [purring] I 'm losing it. I 'm definitely losing it. [meows] [phone_ringing] Mmm. Cool. Look, you think they 're talking to their stock brokers? Harvey, thanks for those flowers in my locker the other day. You figured it out, huh? Yeah, I figured it out. You 're a real pal, Harvey. Anyone ever tell you that? Yeah, all the time. Boy : Hey, there 's the boys. Hey! He 's a senior, Sabrina. [laughing] I said, he 's a senior. So that means he ca n't be seen with a sophomore? No, it means he does n't even see sophomores. I wish I could change that. Anyway, he came to my party. He just came for the free food. I do n't think so. What, what do we have here? See you later, dudes. He called us dudes! Both : Ahh! Yeah. [hurdle_falling] [groaning] Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to check out the boys on the track team and target a date for the Spring Fling which is a very good reason to want to get on the track team Seth 's on it. You 're a genius. I know. Come on, ladies. I want everyone to try out for this event. Yeah, right. Katy Lemore 's already on this event and she owns this event. Nobody ever wants to try out against her. Katy Lemore thinks she owns everything. [chuckles] That 's how it 's done, kids. Have you thrown a javelin before? - Nope. - You 'll catch on fast. First time for everything. Okay, ladies, listen up. You all saw how Katy did it. Just follow her moves. Okay, I 'll show you how to do it. Come with me. First, you take the javelin, and you hold it right here. Now, there are three different grips. Wish I knew what I was doing. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go. Do n't just stand there. At least try it. Woo hoo! Yeah! Just proves there 's such thing as beginner 's luck. Coach : You 're a natural, Sabrina. Do you want to be on the team? Well, okay. Sure. Great. Okay, training starts tomorrow after school. That was great! Sorry you did n't get on the team. Oh, it 's okay. I did n't expect to. My house, this weekend. The whole team is invited. And I will take it as a personal insult if everybody 's not there. What 's going on? Oh, it 's Katy 's annual pool party for the track team. Katy : I mean everybody. That means you, too, Sabrina. I want you to make sure you 're there. I would n't miss it for the world. Great. Well? This and the Spring Fling are, like the social events of the year. What do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!? [rock]?? Awesome lady, fashion lover?? Chews them up and [spits] them out?? Keeps her weapons undercover?? Never leaves me with a doubt?? Makes me do just what she pleases?? Everything just seems so right?? When she talks she never teases?? Keeps me up all through the night?? She 's hot, she 's got?? Personality, personality?? All right, all night?? Personality, personality?? Personality? I think it is the first time Katy Lemore will know the meaning of the word competition. $75? I wish it was less. Is that all? Yeah. [scanner_beeps] Oh. It 's only $15. It must be on sale. That 's strange. Man, this is your luck day. I do n't know what 's going on. Yeah, I guess so. [chattering]? Personality, personality?? All right, all night?? Personality? Oh! Okay, would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks. It 's okay. Well, call us, and we 'll pick you up, then. We 'll manage a ride home. Are you sure? Positive. Well, then, have a good time. Yeah. Zelda : Yeah, have fun, girls. Both : Bye. Zelda : Fun, fun, lots of fun. Okay? Fun, fun, fun. Fun, fun. Fun, fun. Maybe we should spy on her. - Salem? - Meow. You be good. Stay out of trouble. And keep an eye on her. Salem : Meow. Leave it to me. Ahh!? [reggae]? What 's wrong with this picture? You mean other than the fact we 're on the lifestyles of the rich and stupid? Like, you noticed? Like, totally. Both : Cool. Wow. If this is how the other half lives, I could get used to this. [no_audible_dialogue] Katy : Sabrina. So glad you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Marty. Marnie. Oh. Whatever. Oh, listen, we 're having a big diving contest in a bit. You do dive, do n't you? She was a gold medalist at her last school. Is that true? Actually, it was silver. Great. Well, we 'll see you in a bit. Oh, the cabana 's over there. Okay.? And so I say?? I 've got you on my mind?? Yeah, yeah?? I 've got you on my mind?? Every time that you go, every time you go?? Every time that you go? Hello, Harvey. Hi. Katy. Hey, the water 's great, you know. Great party. Since when are you on the track team? I 'm not really on it, but I 'm near it. Near it? Yeah, coach wants me to be the hurdle painter. You know, hurdles get beat up, and need painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look great, you know. Stunning, really. Just, wow. Save it. You can stay. You 'll probably enjoy the festivities coming up. I know how much you love surprise parties. Salem : Meow. Nice hair cut. [barks] Come back. I was just kidding. This wax should help her take off. Sabrina! Hey, great suit. Thanks. So Katy was telling us that you 're a fantastic diver. Oh, well, I did n't exactly say I was fantastic. But everybody 's waiting to see you dive. We ca n't wait. The diving contest is starting. You 're up first. Everybody ca n't wait to see your technique. Seth especially. [barks] She 's going to be so embarrassed she 'll transfer right back to wherever it was she came from and never show her face again. Fran : You 're jealous. I 'm not jealous. I 'm just going to make sure there 's nothing to be jealous about. Attention. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just making sure everybody 's watching. Sabrina, Sabrina, Sabrina! Sabrina, Sabrina, Sabrina! Sabrina, Sabrina, Sabrina. Well, are you going to dive, or not? Holy cow. [cheering] Okay, you wan na play rough? No more Mr. Nice Guy. [barking_and_meowing] cathisses, @dog_whines Wimp. You know, Sabrina, I do n't think it 's a very good idea to go up against Katy Lemore. Can I use your mic? Sabrina : She seems like she 's out to get me. What'dI do? Marnie : C'm on, you 've been staring at Seth likehe'san horsd'oeuvre, andyouhaven'teaten for a week. Have not. Yeah, right. Sabrina : I think he 's so gorgeous. Imeanhe evenmakes Brad Pitt look like a nerd. Did you check out his butt? applause, [cheering] I could watch those tight buns run around the track all day. [laughing] He 's so gorgeous. Fran : I could watch those buns all day. jeering, [laughing] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @.? [cartoon_music]? Sabrina? I ca n't ever go back to school. I want to go back to Massachusetts. What is it, sweetheart? Weeping Sabrina, dry your tears of concern. Tonight, you have great secrets to learn. [owl_hooting] To be opened only under the full moon. [flames_flickering] Ah, we 're just in time. And I see you 've already found it by yourself. This, dear, is your heritage. You 've probably been feeling a bit odd lately. Different? Well, you are different. Different? You 're a witch. [giggles] A witch? [laughs] Uh-huh. I ca n't be a witch. There 's no such thing. Oh, you 're wrong, sweetheart. We 're witches, too. [wind_whipping] Your javelin, dear. This ca n't be happening. This has got to be a dream. You 're not dreaming, Sabrina.. This special place exists only for witches. It 's the world of magic. Every new witch must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you doing this to me? It 's not something we 're doing to you. It 's something you are. It 's how you were born. With the gift of magic. Magic? Both : Magic. That 's right. Magic. This has got to be a dream. Morning. Good morning. Morning, sweetheart. Salem : No, it was n't a dream. It was real. [spits] You really can talk. I 'm hallucinating. This is nuts. No, no. You 're not crazy. It all seems very strange, but it 's all very real. My parents? Yes, they 're witches, too. They had to go on their sabbatical because every witch must be delivered to trainers when they reach their 16th birthday. We 'll be here to help you as you learn to use your powers. My powers? Of course, dear. What 's the point of being a witch if you ca n't do magic? - Salem. - Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be your guinea pig. Though you 're handsome as a cat, not, not pig, turn into rat. [laughing] Salem : Very funny. You 've had your joke. Cool. Oh, that 's nothing, dear. When Hilda gets going, she 's really good. You know that whole Susan Lucci thing? The actress? She 's lost 15 years in a row. Hilda hates that show. Wow. Though you 're handsome as a rat, Salem, change back into a cat. I do n't know why I put up with this. Witches. But every witch must learn to harness her powers. The decision of how to use your power is yours alone, Sabrina. And Salem? Salem is our familiar, dear. He 's an animal that help do our bidding. [tinkling_chimes] Here 's some extra homework. [phone_rings] Your friends are calling. I ca n't face them. Why ever not? The party last night, Katy 's party. Everybody heard me talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Okay, Sabrina. Just this once. Sail the times of wind and place so poor Sabrina can save face. Time, begone. - [phone_ringing] - What do you mean? It never happened. Hello? Hey, Sabrina. You okay? I think so. Must'vebeen the food, huh? It was real nasty, and you looked so sick. Sick? Yeah, andit ' sashame, too, ' causeyoumissed all those guys in those little bathing suits and diving competition. I did n't even dive? No one heard me talking? Dive? You were only there 10 minutes. This is so great. See you soon. Okay. Bye. It worked. It 's true. I 'm a witch. Salem : Go ahead. Cast a spell. You know you want to. We 'll, I 'm a witch, so let 's make a switch. Stop. Stop! [chattering] [bell_rings] Okay, folks, put away your books. Let 's get to it. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. That is going to be my score on this test. [sighs] Let 's get to it. B... B, B, B, B. No, no. Photosynthesis... C... B. Yeah, yeah. B. [groans] No. Is there a problem, Miss Littlefield? No, Mr. Dingle. There 's no problem. No problem at all. In my mind, in my sight, make all of Marnie 's answers right. Hmm? Is there a discussion you two would like to share? No, Mr. Dingle. Okay, time 's up. Pass over your papers. Maybe I 'll look at yours now, Marnie. Sure, why not. It seems you 've done very well. I have? Yes, you have. I think I 'll go lie down. What 's going on with him? [murmuring] Look at him. He 's gonzo. [whispering] Okay, here goes the big one. By the power of all the stars above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me.? [discordant_tones]? Hi. Hi. What happened? I do n't know. It did n't work. What? Nothing. I 've got news. You know that guy, the shot putter, the guy I danced with? He asked me to the Spring Fling. Plan worked. I got a date. Oh, you did. That 's great! Yeah, I thought so. So, all we have to do is find you somebody, and it 's perfect. That 's not going to be so easy. Want some tea, sweetheart? What 's wrong, Sabrina? I do n't understand. It was going so well! What 's that, sweetheart? The witchcraft. It was working, and then, nothing. Zilch. What happened? Well, I was trying some things out and everything was going fine, except that... well, I was concentrating on this boy. A boy? Yeah, you know Seth. He was at my party? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school? Well, I cast a spell on him, you know, to get him to notice me -- You cast a spell for love. Yeah, I cast a spell for love. Well, you saw him. You know. Yes, we know, but you ca n't. Ca n't what? You ca n't cast a spell for love. No such thing as a love potion? Not anymore. In the old days, some witches, some bad witches, did cast spells for love. And it always ended in heartache. So the Great Witches ' Council convened and it was decided to abdicate that power. We got in a circle, we held hands. We promised. Love is too precious for anyone to tamper with. I ca n't believe you did that. Hilda : Well, it 's true, dear. Great, the one power that might really be useful, and I do n't even have it. Believe me, Sabrina, it 's better this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Maybe she 'll be one who does n't appreciate her powers. Oh, give her time. It 's not easy, growing up. You never appreciated your magic until you were 200, if I recall. [bell_rings] As the flames engulfed her, her screams grew louder. Her struggle ceased, a smile locked on her twisted face. Such was the fate of Abby Lang, the witch. Did she really cause the storm that destroyed the Isle of May lighthouse in 1636? We 'll never know. But they thought so. Any comments, Sabrina? No. One more thought : during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, 1558-1603, any woman who lured a man into marriage by the aid of makeup high-heeled shoes or a wig was subject to punishment as a witch. How many young ladies in this room today are guilty of the same with the Spring Fling just around the corner? Class dismissed. [chattering] Sabrina, hi. Hi. Oh, it 's too bad you had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned. Well, my guess is I would n't have liked it much, anyway Well, maybe some other time. So, I hear Carpenter 's renting a limousine for the Spring Fling. I guess my telling him how cheap he is finally paid off. I just hope he does n't get a white one. They 're so tacky. Katy : We 're probably going in Seth 's Camaro. Fran : You 're going with Seth? When did he ask you? He has n't, yet. But I know he 'll ask me when I win the All City. And then I 'll put him out of his misery and accept. Watch this princess throw a fit. Send her a humongous... [boing] Hey, what 's that on your face? What? Come here. Ah! Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God! Fran : That 's so gross! Katy : Oh! Oh, God. [laughing] Katy, where are you going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Mm. Remain... Okay. Okay. First, you take a deep breath and jump. Then when you 're on your way back to the ground, you simply miss. Miss what? Zelda : You miss the ground. Uh, I do n't know about this whole flying thing. Oh, oh, Sabrina. One of the greatest treats of being a witch is being able to fly. What about that little thing called gravity? Magic, it 's just a matter of technique, practice, and one other thing. What? When you feel good about who you are, being true to yourself, then nothing can keep you down. [grunts] Okay, um... Bad luck. Try again. Okay? Yeah. Ready, girl? Okay. [grunts] No, get - - [grunting] Oh. Um... Okay, um... Maybe you should give it a rest. She needs to try this on her own. I think you 're right. Okay. [crash] Salem : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the stake? No, of course not. Whoever told you that was a liar and a fraud. Usually, they were drowned in a river. - Or hung. - Thanks, I feel a lot better. That was only the bad witches. You 're a good witch. You 've got nothing to worry about. Trust me. Well, I now know how to get Seth to ask me to the Spring Fling. And it 's not by using a love spell. I found a loophole. Meow. Do tell. Do n't be such a nosy cat. You 'll just have to wait and see. Hey, Ward. - Hey. - Hey. All right, we got -- Come on, Sabrina. Get the lead out. I want you on the field now. Every dog has his day, every shark has his fin. But I 've got the sneakers that can run like the wind. - Hey, Sabrina. - Hi, Marnie. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you okay? Yeah, fine, great. Runners, take your marks. Set. Hey, Sophomore. Ready to lose? [starter_pistol] Harvey : Go, Sabrina! [cheers] All right, my sister! Go! Woo! Move it, Katy! [panting] [cheering] Woo! Great, race, Sabrina. You made record time. All right, all right. Yeah! Look at her! Woo! Woo! Wow! Holy Moses. Coach : Sabrina, you can stop now. Sabrina. Way to go. Thanks. Hey, Sabrina. That was a great run. - It was, really -- - Thanks. Careful she does n't run over you, Harvey. A little competition never hurt anybody. One race does n't make a winner. Well, everybody has an off day, huh, Katy? Yeah, well, I 'm just saving myself for All City. That 's when we 'll separate the winners from the losers. Okay. [chattering] Look, there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Hey, Sabrina. Over here. You talking to me? Yeah, you. Come on, join us. It 'll be fun. Oh, I do n't know. Do n't worry. Katy went home to lick her wounds. There 's space. Oh, well. Sure, why not? Great. Come on. Come on, Marnie. It 'll be fun. Sure, I mean, I do n't think there 's much space left at the table, but, sure. Actually, I just remembered that I forgot something at my locker, so - - I 'm gon na go get that. - But Marnie -- - Suit yourself. Come on. Better go, Sabrina. There 's only so much room at the table. Fran : Hi, Sabrina. - Hi. - Hi. Katy is so mad. She thinks you cheated somehow. She 's throwing a fit. So we were just discussing Freddi 's new nose. What do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I mean, it will be when the swelling goes down. Dr. Hoftedder is a genius. He 's going to do my lips next. What do you think? Well, I think they 're fine now. [chuckles] You 're kidding, right? How can you be all that you can be if you 're not willing to look like someone else? You know what I mean? So, who does your hair? I do. Oh, that 's okay. We 'll get you out of your cocoon in no time. So, are you going to beat Katy at the All City race? I 'm sure going to try. Sabrina, cut the modesty shtick. We 're your friends now. [chuckles] [slurping] Oh, sister. We 're made some chili, sweetheart. Would you like some? No, no thanks. I think it could use some eye of newt. Just kidding. I knew that. So, anything exciting happen today? Yeah. I finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, got him? Well, I found a way around that no love spell rule. I put a spell on my running shoes, I beat Katy, and Seth was so impressed, I 'm sure he 's going to ask me -- Sabrina, did n't you read the magic book? Did n't Salem tell you? Salem : Uh-oh. Tell me what? You did tell her, Salem, did n't you? You are supposed to be helping. Well, not exactly. Why did n't you tell her? Is n't it obvious? He wants her all to himself. What are you talking about? Hilda : Shame on you, Salem. Zelda : Double shame. Would somebody please tell me what 's going on here? It 's right here in the book. Where 's the book? Here it is. Witches and cows... Humans. Witches and humans. Witches are forbidden to use witchcraft to win love, but if witchcraft is used on a mortal in any form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his heart, and his kiss shall... His kiss shall what? His kiss shall turn you into a witch 's familiar. You mean I 'll be turned into a cat? For 90 years. But if he loves you with a pure heart, then you 're okay. Oh, well... I know Seth would love me that way. You know, with a pure heart. Then there 's no problem. Love is something that 's given freely by others because they want you to have it. And animal passion alone begets animal passion, just like Salem. You mean Salem -- 'Fraid so. Salem was once a misguided warlock. But it was worth it. Well, I know Seth and he would never... Oh, well... Then you have nothing to worry about. Teenagers. Hi. Excuse me? Did somebody say something? Come on. Do n't take it personally. So how was your power lunch with Katy 's gang the other day? It was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean, did you see the way they looked at me? No. I did n't. The truth of the matter is, I did n't feel that comfortable there either. So? So... I just wanted to tell you I 'm sorry. Go on. You 're not going to make this easy, are you? No way, sister. Look, I know I 've been acting strange lately. It 's Seth. I 've never felt this way about anyone before. Does your heart start pounding? Yeah. And you start to feel a little faint when he 's near? Like I might just fall over. And your palms get all sweaty? Drenched. Have you ever felt like this? Nope. No, I have n't. So that 's not how you feel about Jeff? No, that 's not how I feel about Jeff. I 'm going to the Fling with Jeff for one reason and one reason only. What 's that? He asked me. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's all I need. Should n't sell yourself short. I 'm not selling myself at all. I mean, I 'm just being realistic. It 's a dance. It 's not a marriage. Jeff 's fine. So, you really have it bad, though, do n't you? Yeah. Poor kid. But you know, once I win All City for the school, I know Seth will ask me to the Spring Fling. I just know it. Well, then a girl 's got ta do what a girl 's got ta do, do n't we? Will you help me, Marnie? Yeah, sure. How? I 've got a plan. Phase two. Well, what was phase one? Do n't ask. I 'm gon na win him on my own. Well, of course you are. With my help. [chuckles] Right. So let 's do this. - Ready? - Yes. - Let 's go. - Okay. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! Kick Katy 's butt. Go, go, go, go! Woo! Yay! Yeah! Woo! - Yeah! - Yeah! Hey, Harvard. You do n't happen to have an extra set of those questions for econ, do you? What questions? The one's on the test I 'm supposed to take next period. No, Seth, I do n't. Sorry. Well, I guess I 'll have to get them from somebody else, then. So, you and Katy still history? Well, I have n't actually made up my mind. But I 'm probably going to ask whoever wins All City. Unless, well... Unless maybe you should ask Katy out. Do n't be ridiculous. What 's the matter? Do n't you like her? Sure, I like her. I mean, what 's not to like? Any guy would have to be insane not to want to -- It 's only that -- Yes? She 's not my type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a babe lined up for the Spring Fling, do n't you, Harvard? I 'm still working on it. [cheering] All : Woo! P.A. : Would all contestants please report to center field? Coach : Okay, ladies, this is it. The big one. Today, we are going to be in competition and the whole idea behind competition is to win. All : Yeah! Am I making myself clear? All : Yeah. Good. All right, so, let 's go, Riverdale! [cheering] Right on! P.A. : The owner of a brown Chevrolet, you left your lights on. Is n't that Sabrina 's friend, Harvey? Yes, it is. He 's awfully cute. He looks troubled. Perhaps I 'll just see what he 's thinking. Zelda. He looks so unhappy. Okay, then be quick. Okay. Zelda : Oh. Hilda : What? Zelda : He wants Sabrina to lose. Why? Well, have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Oh. - Oh, my. - Uh-huh. Love. Ca n't live with it, ca n't live without it. Oh. Thanks. I 'm on my own now, win or lose, so drain the magic from my shoes. And the plot thickens. P.A. : Ladies and gentlemen, please stay clear of the track. trumpetfanfare, [cheering] [sighs] [starter_pistol] [cheering] Yeah! Yes! P.A. : Katy Lemore of Riverdale High winsthesprint. Well, could n't stay away, could you, Salem? Salem : I thought you 'd be interested to know that Sabrina is not going to use any magic. She 's testing this boy 's love. Oh, Zelda. Maybe she will be the witch we expected her to be. Ta-ta. P.A. : Ladies and Gentlemen, the up to date results... [cheering] Oh. Oh, yes! Sabrina! P.A. : The winner of the broad jump event isSabrinaSawyer of Riverdale High. CentralHigh comes in second andWesternin third. RiverdaleHigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SecondplacegoestoCentral. Third, Western. Come on. P.A. : Ladies and Gentlemen, the winner of the All City meet comesdownto oneevent : the800-meterrun. Oh, God. I ca n't watch. [starter_pistol] Ugh! [gasping] No, she 's got to do this on her own. Every dog has his day, every shark has his fin. And I 've got the sneakers that can win. Sabrina. So, do you want to go to the Spring Fling, or what?? [marching_band]? All : Yay, Riverdale! Hey, Harvey. How 's it going? Hi, Sabrina. So, Seth asked you to the dance, huh? Yeah. You really like him, do n't you? Him? Seth? Yeah, I do. I guess every girl in the school would say the same thing. Can I ask you a question? What 's he got -- What makes him so -- Perfect? Well, first, there 's his smile -- No, no. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvey? It 's just that I 've been thinking a lot about you and me. There 's something I want to tell you. What? Aw, nothing. Have a nice time with Seth. You 'll save a dance for me, right? Sure. You promise? Of course. Great. [purring] You can turn around now. Do you like it? Wow. I mean, meow! You know what I mean. Do you think Seth will like it? - Yeah. - [car_honking] Unless someone slapped him with a stupid stick. Hilda : Sabrina? Are you coming down? That must be him. Wish me luck. [sighs] Is he here yet? Well, he appears to be waiting in his car. Well, I better get going. If he was a gentleman, he would come to the house, introduce himself properly, and escort you to his nice car. Maybe he 's no gentleman. She 's in big trouble. Maybe we should drive you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @.? [hip-hop]? - Hey, Sabrina. - Hi, Seth. You do n't mind if we give these guys a lift, do you? Oh, no. That 's okay. - Wicked. - Hi, guys. Hiya. Hockey 's much tougher than football. What? Have you ever seen a Riverdale hockey player? Maybe he 'd like to be turned into a mouse. Oh, do n't be silly. She 's so vulnerable. We 've got to help her. Hilda, rules are rules. There can be no intervention. This is one lesson she 's just going to have to learn on her own. Hey, Seth, what 's going on? Seth, man, what 's going on? - Hilda. - What? - I 'm not doing anything. - Put the car down. Put the car down. C'm on, let 's go, let 's go. [tires_squealing] Another game of fish.? [synthpop]? Cool. One for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Okay. This silver and white thing is just brilliant. You 're so great. Yeah, uh, thanks. Hey, uh, listen. Is Sabrina here yet? Marnie : I have n't seen her. Hey, Seth. Hey, Seth.? If you can be open?? I can do without the attitude?? So just be straightforward, that 's all I ever ask of you? Seth, over here! Can you excuse me for just a sec, Sabrina? I 'll be right back. Okay. Sure.? Is there a lack of?? Communication?? It 's just a lack of?? Communication?? Ooh, oh?? You run and hide? No, no. What I mean is are we going to hit the lookout after the Fling, or what? It 's tradition, man. Yeah, right. Uh, Seth. You know, I 'm really kind of thirsty. Oh, you know what? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you? You guys thirsty? - Nah. - I do n't want anything. Get me a root beer. Thanks. Thanks. Yeah, so, um... How 's it going, Cinderella? Fine. Can I get four colas and a root beer for Prince Charming? So what 's the prince like up close and personal? Well, there are a lot of people around. It 's kind of loud. I guess there is n't enough of him to go around, huh? Hey, look. There 's Marnie and Jeff. Wow, she looks like she 's having a great time. Go, Marnie!? It 's just a lack of?? Communication?? Is there a lack of?? Communication?? It 's just a lack of?? Communication?? Whoa!?? Is there a lack of?? Communication? Hey, remember, one dance for me, right? You promised. Sure. Really?

You 're not some innocent little sophomore. I 'm onto you. All this voodoo stuff. I 'm gon na tell everyone that you 're some kind of a witch. I am? That 's ridiculous. I 'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too. [cackles] You really are a witch, and I 'm gon na tell everyone. Wait, Katy. Come back. You ca n't! Come back! You, who lives to impress, change back into your poodle pest. [barks] [whines_and_barks] [dog_barking] - Hey, guys. - Hi. Hey, there you are. There 's a bunch of us going up to Lookout Point. Let 's go. It 'll be fun. I want us to get to know each other a little better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a dance with him. We 'll be back in lots of time. I promise. Scout 's honor. I do n't know.

It 's beautiful. Come on over. I am over. No, closer. I thought you said there were going to be a lot of other people here. Everybody that counts is in this car right now. But I think what we need here is a little less talk and a little more action. Relax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know each other. Sabrina. It 's getting late. No, we have the whole night. I mean, nobody comes back from the Fling until dawn. It 'd be uncool. It would? Yes. It would. Seth, I want you to take me back now. You want me to take you back? Yeah. You promised. I promised that? Yes. Oh. Oh, yeah, that must have been me trying to get you to come to Lookout. I, uh -- Oh, come on. Just one kiss. No. Just come on. No. You lied to me. Then why 'd you come up here? I do n't know. Do n't know what? Look, come on. Where are you going? The dance is almost over. We wo n't make it back now, anyway. So get back in the car. I would n't get back in that car with you for anything.

Well, if you really want to know, I came to rescue you. But I can see you 're okay. I 'm not so sure. I 've been a real idiot. Big time. Do n't be hard on yourself. Can you forgive me? Yeah, sure. Friends? Friends. You know, I only have one regret. That we wo n't get to have our dance. Me, too. You know, I 've got an idea. We can still make it. Get on. I 've got a better idea. Come here. Close your eyes. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for music only we two can hear. Do you hear that? [laughing] Look! What? - What? - Did n't you see that? No. But -- How did we get here? You drove us.
