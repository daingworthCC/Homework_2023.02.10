5242041 [choral_music]??( winston) Case number 0386 -- St. Benedictine Monastery, Quebec. Now, me, personally, when I think of vows of obedience and silence, I do n't exactly think of Christopher Chance. In fact, the two are sort of like oil and water... so I was n't real keen on taking the case in the first place. But then again, I could n't help thinking it might do Chance some good. You know, " redemption is thine. Seek and ye shall find. " I mean, traveling 1,000 miles on a case is a roundabout way of hoping to find something like that, but then again... Brother Mitchell?( winston) Fate 's a funny thing. You know what? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. I 'm - - I 'm getting ahead of myself. Let me start at the beginning. This case, as they so often do, began with a crime -- A crime centered around a kid named John Gray. Nice guy. Never would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most vicious crews around - - a crew led by one Sam Fisher, The mastermind of some of the biggest heists in the last ten years and a monster, plain and simple. Now, Fisher would set his sights on high-dollar targets, then send John Gray in to case the place, which is how he met Emily. And the more he got to know her, the more he realized he wanted out of his old life so he could have a shot at a new one with her. So John called the cops... [gunfire] And managed to escape. But it did n't take long for Sam Fisher to escape too. He paid somebody off... had them hide a little something to help his getaway. [groans] [groaning] [gunshots] [brakes_whining]( winston) With Fisher out, John Gray was suddenly in danger, which is why Emily came to us for help. John never hurt anyone. Look, he grew up on the streets, and he hustled to survive. He 's smart. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you think this John Gray is different. I know how this sounds. But you have to believe me that John is a good man. Please... You 're my chance to save him. [sighs] So where exactly is John now? A monastery? A remote monastery. 200 miles north of the border of Quebec. He 's there, he 's unarmed, probably. And as we speak, six of his heavily-armed buddies are on their way up there looking for retribution. So why hide out in a monastery? Do n't know. Well, there 's got to be thousands of them - - why that one? Do n't know. What, you do n't like " do n't know " now? I thought " do n't know " was your favorite part of this job. No, you had me with heavily-armed crew invading a remote monastery, but that 's just me. " I do n't know " -- That usually scares the crap out of you. Ah... Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odds to protect an unrepentant fugitive from justice, not a peep out of you? What am I missing? This is a guy who made some mistakes. This is a guy who 's trying to put those mistakes behind him. If we ca n't help a guy like that... what the hell are we doing here? So where exactly is this place?( winston) It 's up in the mountains, kust above a village called Port Cartier, and accessible only by cable car.( Chance) So we go up there, quietly find Gray and get him to safety, tip the cops in Fisher 's direction, problem solved.( winston) Yeah, assuming we 're not too late already. Fisher and his men have been on the loose for days. There 's no way of knowing when they 'll reach the monastery. So let 's do this and do it quickly. Are you in position? Brother Mitchell? Yes. Yes, I am.? Human Target 1x04 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( Winston). Now, I have to admit, I was a little bit nervous about Chance on his own in a place of worship. As long as I 've known him, I 've never seen him set foot in a church either. I guess he 's not much of a religious man. At least, that 's what he tells me. Truth be told, I 'm not sure what the guy believes in. Funny story. I 'm headed up here, friend of mine says he knows a guy here. His name 's John Gray. Any idea how I could find him? Oh. I get it. You 're kind of in the middle of something here. I wo n't bother you.( man) shh. Say, if I wanted to get everybody together here just in one room, how would I do that? [church_bell_tolling]( Winston) Are all the monks there? Mm-hmm. Do you see Gray? Mm-mm. [clears_throat] Man, you are tanking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check my taskbar. Okay. Uh, I got old testament. I got new testament. I got hymns. I got the lyrics to this little light of mine, If that does anything for you. It 's okay, I got it. Got it? What do you mean, you got it? I sought the lord, and he answered me... delivered me from my fears. Look to him, and be radiant. Your faces shall not be ashamed. His poor soul cried and was heard by the lord. And was saved from every trouble. Psalms 34, 4 through 6. Amen.( Winston) That was n't half bad. Now... Could we just get on with it and find our man, please? I thought you said we 'd be in the clear After we crossed the border. Do n't worry about it. Good morning, officer. Is there a problem? No, no problem. Standard roadside checks within 50 miles of the border. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - [gunshots] Noah, grab his gear. After you hide the body, head to the gondola station. Once we get to the top of the mountain, no one goes to or comes from that monastery. Um, excuse me. There 's a brother here that I 'm looking to connect with. His name is John Gray. I 've got a message for him, but I ca n't seem to find him. Of course not. It 's 11:00. What 's at 11:00? He leads the alternative services... in the library. So he has to sacrifice himself to save the one true earth. I do n't get it. What - - what do n't you get? Well, in this one, he dies. Right. And then suddenly, in this one, he 's alive again. Exactly. See the anti-monitor, wants to destroy all the earths in the multi-verse, right? But in order to prevent him from using the antimatter cannon, the flash has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he - - he comes back. Like jesus. I think I 've got him.( Winston) All right, let me know when you 're bringing him down. Can we help you? John Gray? I 'm assuming you 're still interested in the materials we spoke about? I am. I can get those for you... by tonight. I know how risky this job is for you, But I think you 'll be more than happy with your reimbursements. They 'll be ready for the exchange. See, that 's the thing that bothers me. Whenever a client does n't blink at my fee, I start asking questions about who I 'm working for. So what 's your point? I just figure there 's someone bigger than you in the food chain involved, and I want to know who. I make the delivery, you spill the beans. We got a deal? I get the item in my hands, we 'll talk. I 'm curious. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off. What changed? It was never about how I could do it. [cell_phone_ringing] It was always about when. With Chance and his partner out of the country, I finally got the opportunity I 've been waiting for. When I got it, I 'll call you. You need to listen to me. You 're in danger right now, and I 've been hired to come up here and protect you. Pr - - protect me from what? Sam Fisher. He 's free, so is the rest of his crew, and they know where you are. H-how do they know where I am? Emily. Emily? Is she all right? She 's fine. But they took the letters you sent her. This is - - this is bad. This is really bad. Yeah, well it 's gon na get a whole lot worse, but that 's where I come in. I 've got a car waiting for you at the bottom of the hill. Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fisher back on his heels. No, I ca n't leave. I mean, if Fisher really is on his way here, I ca n't leave. It 's - - it 's complicated.( Abbot) Complicated how exactly? Um... Hey. Hey, I just spotted the gondola going up the mountain. I thought you said you were gon na signal me when you were ready to come down. What the hell 's going on? [communicator_interference] Chance. Chance, are you reading me? Did you call for the gondola? [interference_continues] [sighs] Once the grounds are secure, the priority is finding the object. Everything else comes second. You 're saying Gray gets to walk away from what he did? I 'm saying once we get the object, Gray is fair game. Until then, we stick to the plan. Are we clear? Are we clear? Yeah. High-value antiquities, relics -- It was my job to nominate the targets. And you singled out this abbey. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicene Annals. They 're a myth. Okay, just for fun, somebody want to fill me in here? Yeah. Yeah. Uh, so the council of Nicea... gathered in 397 to settle the nature of christianity itself. A bishop from jerusalem wrote an account of this meeting that was held in secret. It was passed down through the papal lines until it was lost in the 16th century during the sack of Rome. Then 400 years later, a sister in Austria reported seeing a book matching its description in the possession of an allied chaplain in Belgium -- Father Robert Regan. My predecessor at this monastery. Yeah. To the right buyer, that book is worth millions. And I figured I 'd get in, I 'd find the book, and I 'd get out. I 'd sell it, and I 'd take off for parts unknown. I 'm sorry. I suppose we always knew you 'd have to confront your past sooner or later. Wait a minute. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regretted. But I also sensed a good man, seeking a better path. If I ca n't help a man like that... what am I doing here?( Chance) All right, this book... Are we sure Fisher knows about it? This monastery was supposed to be our next job After the museum. We had it all planned out. Listen, when Fisher gets here, he 's gon na tear this place apart looking for it. People are gon na get hurt. Why do n't we just give it to him? I would. Only I do n't have it. Chance, are you there? Yeah, yeah, I 'm still here. Oh, good. Lost you for a second there. Listen, we got a major problem. I just made one of Fisher 's guys down here at the gondola station, And that gondola 's been up there About ten minutes now, which means... Wait a minute.( Chance) The gondola 's up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come up with a new plan to get you down off that mountain. [door_bangs_open] Chance. Chance! No, no! Aah! Oh, I 'm sorry. I - - [gasps] [groans] Oh, my. [cell_phone_ringing] This is Guerrero. It 's Winston! Where the hell have you been? I called you, like, 30 times in the last 10 minutes! All right, listen. I thought this job was straightforward, but it 's gotten kind of complicated, and I 'm gon na need your help. Busy today, dude. Sorry. You 're busy? Chance and the principal are in danger. What the hell could you be so busy with it ca n't wait? Dude, my life does not revolve around you, as hard as that may be for you to believe. I 'm on another job. Another -- Look, Fisher and his crew are here. Now Chance is stuck up on that mountain with those psychopaths. Now, he told me you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him here, fast. Well, I know who he means. That guy 's not really an option. We kind of had a falling out. Well, ca n't you apologize? Yeah, if I had, like, a time machine or a hell of a ouija board. Listen, you 're gon na be fine, man. You 're, uh... capable. Capable? Hey, who the hell do you think you 're talking -- Got to go. [sighs] C-4. It 's enough to level this place. When Fisher does a job, he never leaves any witnesses. We 're gon na have to do something to save those monks. How can I help? You want to help? We got to find this book before they do, before they blow this monastery right off the map. So what happens next?( Chance) Fisher and his crew came for the annals. So if we can get our hands on that book first, we 'll be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our only shot at saving them. So what 's the deal, you never found this thing? No, it 's not that. I just never got around to taking it. I mean, it 's underneath the monastery. It 's in the old church foundation. Underneath where? The crypt. Abbot Regan used it to store everything He brought back from the war. He always talked about the pieces he got in all those churches in France and Belgium. I just assumed they were souvenirs - - junk. Well, apparently not. How do we get down there? The crypt is connected to the abbey through a network of tunnels, built during prohibition. I thought I was the only one here who knew about it. There 's several entrances off the grounds, But only one inside the abbey. Where is it?( Abbot) unfortunately, it 's right behind where Fisher is holding the monks hostage. The entrance is below a slab, just behind the altar. Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get to the book, and we have to walk right past Fisher to get to it. How are we supposed to do that? I mean, even if we could get past him, this place is an echo chamber. As soon as we move the slab, he 's gon na hear us. If you get your hands on the book, this all ends, yes? It 's a good start. Go. I 'll make sure they ca n't hear you. No, no! It 's too dangerous. Let me - - let me do it. Go. We went through the wine cellar, the basement, nothing. Not to mention, there 's still no sign of Gray. It could take hours to search every inch of this place. Do you realize this? Maybe we 've just been taking the wrong approach. [scoffs] [church_bells_tolling] Go find who 's doing that. [tolling_continues]( Gray) You think the Abbot 's safe? Right now the only way any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get that book. [cell_phone_ringing] [ringing_stops] Son of a bitch. [cell_phone_ringing] damn it, Winston, ca n't you take a hint? I 'm pretty sure I said I 'd call you.( thinman) I 'm aware, but I thought it would n't hurt to check in to see how you were progressing. Is n't that sweet. I 'm still kind of in the thick of it here, and I think you and I both know this is n't something that would just be lying out in the open. Well aware. After all, if this material was n't so personal to its owner, we would n't be so eager to get our hands on it. Right. I 'll be in touch. So, you 've been here about a year. You 've got a pretty good idea where this thing was. Tell me the part again why you did n't just take off with it? Well, that was the plan when I first got here. I looked for the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but there was just one thing about it I could n't shake. Emily. Yeah. I started writing to her, and, you know, she had no good reason to respond, and then she wrote back. She thanked me for saving her. She made you feel like one of the good guys. Do n't worry, happens to the best of us. Hey, are you sure we went the right way back there? Pretty sure. [laughs] Oh! Oh, man. Thank God. I 've been walking for miles. The gondola 's closed for the day. Gondola? Man, I do n't need a gondola. I need some gas. You got a town back there with no gas station. You guys do n't have any gas stashed up here, do you? Sorry. Aw... Well, you got a landline in the office? I just have to make a phone call. I got no bars. Phone 's just for the rangers, okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call a tow truck. It 's a local call. I got the number right here. You mind holding this for me? Look, pops. You got to go. Come on, man. It 'll only take a second! Capable. This place is way bigger than I thought. What was her name? Who? Made you feel like one of the good guys. Oh, that bad, huh? What happened? It just did n't work out. So what exactly are we looking for, anyway? It 's a small box. It 's probably some kind of treated wood with a bronze lock on the lid. I thought it was a book. Well, it 's a scroll, actually. Pope Clement had it sealed in the box when he fled Rome to protect it. It can only be opened with his papal ring. Papal rings are destroyed after their pope dies. You 're saying this thing 's locked in a box we ca n't open? More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tamperproof. So if you try and open it without the ring, its contents are destroyed. Acid? Maybe. Maybe a flint. What would somebody want with a book you ca n't read? Well... [clears_throat] I had a buyer lined up in Spain who was willing to pay $4.5 million for it as is. Tell you what, when we get out of here, I 'll give you his number, you can ask him yourself. Years I worked with Gray -- Not even once was he wrong about a score. I know the book is here. Do yourself a favor and tell me where it is, and this can all be over.( Abbot) Go to hell. [groans] Stop! [guns_clicking] Yes? I know where Gray went. Hey, everything is very fragile, okay? So be careful with that stuff. Hey, what 's this? You said a bronze lock, right?( Gray) That 's it. [chuckles] That 's it! [laughs] Winston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the book. It 's in a tunnel underneath the monastery. Now, look, there 's an exit in a pine grove about a klick north of the compound. You 'll take Gray and the book. I 'm gon na stay here and see if I can get these monks out in one piece. Where are you now? I 'm in the gondola heading up the mountain. What about the chopper? There is no chopper. You did n't get the chopper? At the moment, I 'm all you 've got. Guerrero said the pilot was unavailable, Not that he was in any hurry to get us another one. By the way, he said he was on another job. Any idea what that 's about? No idea. Call him back. Yeah. [cell_phone_ringing] [beep]( Winston) I 'm not exactly sure what I 'm doing here or where any of this is going, But I figure I should start keeping track of all this. So, just completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And for what it 's worth, I hope he can get past this one, Because this case was damn ugly. Her name was Katherine. I need you to take this, go up to the exit, and meet my partner. Where are you gon na go? I 'm gon na go up to the chapel, see if I can sort out that mess. I 'm going with you. Forget it. Forget it? No. I ca n't just run and let everyone else go through this. I mean, I have to go up there. I have to face Fisher. All right, let me spoil the ending for you. This feeling you have right now frequently precedes death. Now, a few months ago, Fisher was in prison and not your problem, but now things are different. I have to try. There 's a woman that cares enough about your life to hire me. I made her a promise, and I intend to keep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to see you again. Wait, it does n't have to be like this. Well, unfortunately, you do n't have a lot to bargain with right now. I assume that 's the book. So I have it, and I have you. But you do n't have the ring. Excuse me? Pope Clement 's ring. You use it to unlock the scroll 's container. Before I came here, I found it at an auction in Chicago. Seller did n't know what it was. No one 's laid eyes on that scroll in five centuries. It 's worth $4 million locked up. Can you imagine what it 's worth unlocked? Where? In a safety deposit box in a bank at the bottom of the mountain. You let everybody go, I 'll take you to it. He 's bluffing. He better not be. You all right? Never better. What 's happening? Gray made a deal. He sacrificed himself. If Gray tries anything, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it. I do n't get the sense that they intend to honor that deal. Neither do I. I do n't understand. Why did Gray trust them? He did n't, but he just got five of their guys out of the room. Now we just got to get past this one. One still seems like a lot given our current situation. We 're working on that. Hey, buddy. [gun_cocks] Probably be a really good time to stop doing what you 're doing. You hold your gun like a cop. From what I understand, cops do n't go around shooting people. I 'm retired. Oh, no, no, no, no! [beeping] Damn! He just started the timer. We got three minutes and counting. I got to go catch that gondola. Wait, wait a minute. What about everybody else here? Even if I could cut all their restraints, we 'd never clear the blast. Diffuse the detonator! How? You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing? The cruise ship. That was n't me! Are you sure? What do you mean, am I sure? It was n't me! I was n't there! It was probably Guerrero. What about the thing in Detroit? Oh, yeah, that was close. Also Guerrero! I do n't know what to tell you. Call Guerrero. [sighs] [cell_phone_ringing] Used to be when you told a guy you were busy, that was respected. I do n't give a rat 's ass about any of that. I 'm talking about looking at ten blocks of C-4 that are wired to blow in two minutes. So if the next words out of your mouth are n't which wire to cut, I swear to -- Dude, you 're unspooling. Calm down. Describe the setup. Hold on. [beeping_continues] All right, I got two wires, both going to the switch -- One red, one blue. Red, definitely red. Wait. What was the other one? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing, how can I make an informed decision? 20 seconds! [coin_jingling] What was that? Did you just flip a coin? No. I heard a slapping sound! Look, dude. I know this is n't what you want to hear right now, but sometimes you just got to go with your gut. Winston? Winston? Winston! In case you 're wondering, It was the blue wire! Good to know. Tom. Tom, what 's your status? [buzzer_sounds] [screams] [gunshot] [gunshot] [screams] [screaming] Oh, my God! [grunts] [screams] [grunts] [groaning] [screaming] Bring him up... Slowly. I 'm gon na need your other hand. What? Grab the gun. I got you. You can do this. One, two, three. [gunfire] [groaning] [coughs] You all right? Yeah, I 'm fine. I 'm fine. [grunts] Well played. [exhales] Thank you.( Abbot) you sure about this? Yeah, I-I-I 've been treading water for too long. It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, our door is always open for you. [laughs] Good luck with everything. You make it sound like our paths will never cross again. Well, short of another reformed fugitive with a violent gang on his tail seeking refuge or you getting into the security business in San Francisco, I 'd say it 's a pretty slim Chance. Funny. I 'm not so convinced. Oh, God. It 's so good to see you. Got to hand it to him, turning himself in like that. How much time do you think he 's gon na get? Well, between Emily corroborating That he was the one that called the cops at the museum, the fact that the rest of Fisher 's crew is back in prison, uh, more or less a year, give or take, less with good behavior. What 's that? Oh, this? It 's, uh, Pope Clement 's ring. He used it to unlock the Nicene Annals. The Abbot sent the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me. As a gift? Payment. Let me get this straight. You got a ring that opens a very expensive book that we do n't have. So in other words, it 's just gon na be another piece of junk gathering dust on your shelf? Maybe. Maybe there 's something else out there that it opens. Oh, that 's a hell of a plan. Hold on a second. Yeah, maybe it unlocks next month 's electric bill. You know, maybe a car note, or maybe the mortgage to this damn place, you know? Oh, yeah - - oh, that 's good. Good, good. Just walk away. Walk away. This ai n't important. Hey. Minimum security 's not that bad. You 're gon na play squash with some I-bankers, eat some overcooked macaroni and cheese. You 'll be out of there before you know it. Yeah, right. Hey, let me ask you something. You think when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me as it does right now? Girl gets you turned around like that, that does n't go away. Thanks for everything.( Winston) I saw the look on his face as he watched Emily and Gray together, and I knew exactly what he was thinking. Of course he 'd never admit it, but... but I know now that he still has n't gotten over her. He 's never gotten over Katherine. It 's what you asked for. We 've been anxious to get a hold of this.( Winston) But it 's more than that, though. I know he still has n't forgiven himself for what happened. Well, I kept up my end of the deal. Now I 'd like to know who you 're working for. You 're in no position to make demands. When we need something more, we 'll contact you.( Winston) I just hope that one day the man will just stop looking for salvation. I hope that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find. He does n't get to just walk away, not after everything he did.( Winston) And it 's not something someone can find for you either. It 's something you have to give yourself. You think you can protect him? You ca n't. We 'll see.
