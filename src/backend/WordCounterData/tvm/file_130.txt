5234341 Can you give us any more revs, Charge? Temps are on the high side and the props are coming clear in the roughest. But I reckon she 'll cope with a few more. OK, roger. Do you hear there? Captain speaking. You 'll be pleased to know we 're nearly through the worst of it and we 'll have clear skies by morning. " Oh! My baby! You kiss me! Kiss me! " Unlike some of us, ET, I 've got standards. I reckon that Buffer 's a one-fish kind of guy. Yee-hee! Righto, you lot! I want these uppers clear for a freshwater washdown! Spider, you 're in charge! Yes, Buff! That storm overnight sure made a mess. You ever seen it blow as big, ET? Mate, I slept like a baby. Did n't feel a thing. Do n't know what you 're talking about. You 're pulling my chain, right? The waves were massive. They were at least 20 metres. 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't asleep too? Squid for breakfast! Looks like we did some illegal fishing in that storm. You were saying? I believe you, Spider. How else did we get all this seafood up here? Hey! There 's something big floating in the water right ahead! 200 yards! Attention, bridge! Attention, bridge! RO reports something in the water dead ahead. I have a visual. Captain has the ship. Port 30. Stop both engines. Port 30. Stop both engines. 100 yards and closing right ahead. 30 port along, sir. Both engines stopped. Very good. Full astern both engines! Full astern both engines. Let 's go take a look. Stop both engines. Stop both engines. A standard dry van, by the looks of it. Swept off the deck of a container ship in the storm? Or a smaller coastal trader. That was a fortunate miss, boss. An understatement, Nav. Probably would have breached our hull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow into the wind, downwind of the container. Do n't want us floating into it. Good eyes, RO. Or should that be ship 's lookout? Just a lucky spot, sir. We 'll need to record the container 's serial number before we decide what to do with it. Who 's up for a recce? It 'll mean one of you in the drink. Suit up, RO. He always goes paper. Well, ca n't get any closer. If we catch this thing on any sharp edges, we 'll be swimming home. So... I 'll, uh, keep an eye out for sharks. It 's a 20-foot isotainer. I mean, I ca n't see a BIC Code. Alright! I 'll go have a look! Right. Charlie 2, this is Romeo 2. There does n't appear to be any numbers on the container. Over. Roger, Romeo 2. We might have to sink it. Over. Whoa! What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this thing. And who 's going to drive it back to base, Romeo? You? According to Customs, there 's been no report of a ship losing cargo, but who knows? So it 's been in the water awhile. Want me to prep a gunnery shoot, sir? I 'd prefer to know what 's inside it first, Buff. We do n't want to create an environmental hazard. As opposed to a shipping hazard. You 've got a point, X. Prep the 50-cal. Aye-aye, sir. There 's an open hatch on the underside. Yeah? What 's in it? Nothing. It 's just full of water. So, what 's keeping it afloat? Uh... an air pocket? Romeo 2, this is Charlie 2. Any luck with the serial number? Over. Uh, negative, sir. But RO reports the container is empty. Over. Oh, that 's good news. Head back to ' Hammersley ' ET. We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Roger. Hey, ET? Do you see that? Yeah. Some sort of... vent. So? Well, these things are normally sealed airtight. Keep the moisture out. There 'll be plenty of moisture inside when the 50-cal 's had its way - come on. No, I 'm going to swim underneath, inside it. See what 's keeping it above the waterline. You said it 's an air pocket. With a vent on the top, all the air would have escaped. No, no, RO, RO, RO! Do n't... Oh, you...! 50-cal gun 's crew - close up, clear away, provide ammunition to the mount. Providing ammunition to the mount. Alright. I 'm taking bets to see how many rounds it 'll take. My money 's on a single shot. One shot for me. Trust the Spider. I vote for three. I think you boys might miss the first couple. Whoo! Nav does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the job at hand. Sorry, boss. If the navy permitted a wager I 'd bet on two rounds of the 50-cal. I 'm with you, sir. There 's a false bulkhead about halfway in. There must be a recess of air above that keeping it buoyant. Oh, right. You mean an AIR POCKET! Come on. It 's got a false wall, ET. It suggests smugglers. Or a partition to separate the goods. Come on. Let 's get in the boat. We 're going. What are they doing out there, having a fish? Give ' em the hurry-up, X. Romeo 2, we 've got a waypoint to make by lunchtime. Hurry it up. Roger. You heard the lady. Come on. R... God! What 's this clown doing now? Hello?! Do you have a problem there, ET? Negative, sir. No problem. What are you doing? RO, get back in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coughing. It might be water swishing around, but... What the hell is he doing? What the hell are you doing?! ET, I 'm starting to lose my patience. I want you to order RO into the RHIB. Over. Hello! This is the Australian Navy! Is there anybody in there?! RO, if you do n't get back inside this boat, I swear... Uh... Charlie 2, this is Romeo 2. We 're going to need some bolt-cutters here immediately. There seems to be someone trapped inside the container. Over. There 's more than one. Not certain of the language. Could be Vietnamese, could be Mandarin. RO reports there 's more than one inside. Unsure of nationality. Roger that. Prepare the quarterdeck. Ow! Hey. Hey, hey. Take it easy, guys. Take it easy. Just a little at a time, OK? Stay warm. It 's OK. It 's OK. Passport here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Pyongyang. Hey, RO? How 's your Korean? About as good as my Swedish. Imagine getting stuck in a tin can like that. No wonder they 're freaked out. At least they can have a wash now, get rid of some of that stink. Why ca n't they just have a shower in the juniors? Spider, it 's against quarantine regulations. They have to remain on the quarterdeck. It just does n't seem right, that 's all. You really want to share your rack with some smelly illegal? Great. Hey, RO. Why do n't you go below, get out of your stinger suit? I 'm alright. It was n't a request. Five North Korean nationals. All in need of varying degrees of medical treatment. None serious. What 's your ETA at base, sir? 1600. Roger. We 'll have ambulances standing by. Sir, we 've just received radio communication from a registered vessel, MV ' Moonshine ' requesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't quite make it out. Their radio must be playing up. It was a very garbled transmission. Position? 10 miles south-west of us. Roger. We 'll rendezvous with them on our way back to base. Aye, sir. Yeah, about, uh, 10 mile north-east of here. We nearly ran into it in the storm last night. Uh, sir, uh, the gentlemen aboard fishing vessel ' Moonshine ' are reporting a derelict shipping container. You 'll be happy to know we 've already dealt with it, fellas. Ah, right, yeah. We would 've blown it out of the water if we had the firepower. Looks like you 've got just about everything else on that boat. Yeah. Yeah, she 's a beauty, is n't she? Named her after my very famous home-brew. Hey, Spider, is that you, mate? How are you going? How were those crabs we gave you? They 're talking about seafood. No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chefo, tell them about the crabs in the freezer. I do n't know what you 're talking about, mate. Well, then, hooroo, Spider. Keep up the good work, mate. See you later, fellas! See you, mate! Spider. Sir? You met those fishermen on Bright Island? Uh, yes, sir. When we were rescuing the marine biologist. They gave me a bag of crabs they 'd been collecting. It 's a pretty flash boat for a couple of crab-harvesters. They were pretty nice crabs, Charge. Sir, uh, the Buffer said you were down here. Just decoding a deltext. Uh, none of the North Koreans speak any English, so getting any useful information out of them is almost impossible. That 's a job for Immigration. Mm-hm. The fishermen just now, and Spider 's crabs - I noticed you eyeballing their boat. Ca n't get away from Bright Island, can you? Do you still think there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm still unclear as to why the feds are involved. Well, I 'm sure if something serious was going on there, they 'd never have let Ursula Morrell back on the island. You 'd think so. Although Ursula seems to have disappeared. And I ca n't locate her. If you 're really concerned, you should definitely notify the feds about it. This is from Marshall. Informing me that Robert 's father has died. What? Taking over my duties, sir? Um... take a seat, RO. RO, one of the most difficult aspects of my job as commanding officer of this ship is... having to give people bad news. How can I help you, sir? It 's my unfortunate duty to inform you that your father... has just passed away. Please accept my deepest condolences on behalf of myself and of the entire ship 's company. Sorry. I thought for a second then you were going to sack me. Hey. Hey. How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor cuts and abrasions. But, um... he 's doing the best he can, but he has n't got much to work with. Well, that 's all anyone can ask. Yeah. Well, if you ask me, I think their problems go a lot further than the physical. Mmm. Oh! Oh, I 'm sorry, sir. You ca n't be up here. If you just come with me. It 's alright. You... It 's OK. It 'll be OK. Oh! That 's alright. I 've got it. OK. It 's yours. That 's yours. Just back to the quarterdeck. Thank you. Is there anyone you want to call, RO? No. You can organise leave when we get back to port. I 'll pierhead-jump a replacement. If it 's all the same with you, sir, I 'd rather keep working. Well, you 'll need some time off. At least for the funeral. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd better get back to work. OK, RO. Er, by the way well done this morning. Thank you, sir. Do you have ANY insight into what just happened then? Oh, you mean the absolute lack of reaction? Yeah. Unfortunately not. I do n't have any idea of RO 's family circumstances, but that was... disturbing. And he does n't make you feel like you can ask. It 's like there 's this brick wall. For a communicator, he is... strangely uncommunicative. Well, people react to loss in different ways, I guess. His father could n't be that old. Maybe he 's in shock. In which case, there may be a delayed reaction. Ah, that 's true. We should be alert for it. It could become a duty of care issue. Keep an eye on him, X. Yeah. Get your stinking sack out of my face. Hey, you right, mate? Swain! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going on? It 's his arm. We 've got to get him down below. Can you grab the kit, mate? You 've got him. Alright. Sit him up here. OK. Robert? Robert? You still with us? Robert? He must have cut his arm opening up that container. He was fine when he got back to the boat, though. Yeah, but salt water, the compression of the stinger suit could have stemmed the blood flow for a bit. Hey, Robert? What? Wake up. Oi! I 'm alright. You did a shocking job of wrapping this, mate. Yeah, well, I only had one arm. Oooh! I do n't have the equipment or the expertise to deal with this. This needs proper cleaning and suturing. No, stuff it. Just wrap it tight and... Oh, no, no, no! Come back here! I help. Sir, sir... I... I... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I doctor. I... doctor. I... I help. Doc... tor. I... help. It looks pretty good to me. I do n't think I 'm going to touch it. You 're not going to restitch it? What for? The stitches are neat. They 're clean. They 're excellent, in fact. I could n't improve on that. I 'm just going to give you a little jab. The file says you 're due for a tetanus. So... whose fine needlework is this, anyway? Your ship 's medical officer? Hmm? Dixon. Glad you had that bag. You speak English? Yes... er, some. You should have told us. It would have... helped us communicate a little better with you. Afraid. Uh... sent back... Pyongyang. Uh... arrest by... government. Uh... shot. Yeah. Yeah, I understand. Still... Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you. Uh, uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ship that you were on? No, we have n't, but we 're looking. The navy, Coastwatch. You must find. Others on ship. What? There are... sorry, other people? Other... other people being smuggled? Other, uh... box. My... my wife, son. You... you must find. You must find. Please. Please. So, how good is this man 's English? Rudimentary, sir, but I 've gathered there are four of them on the second container, including his wife and teenage son. All wanting a better life. Sir, we have to find that container, rescue these people. Coastwatch is on the lookout... No, sir, I mean... that ' Hammersley ' should join in, now that we know there are others on board. I appreciate your enthusiasm, RO, and I 'll certainly contact NAVCOM. Thank you, sir. In the meantime, RO... you should take some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer to stay aboard ' Hammersley ' sir, and help in the search for the missing illegals. I 've got to admit, RO, I 'm having trouble understanding the rationale. You know you 're entitled to compassionate leave. With... respect, sir, it 's quite simple. My father 's dead. Going to his funeral is n't going to change that. But these people are still alive. I can make a difference here. According to the statement this Dr Soong gave Immigration, they boarded the boat in Denpasar and you plucked them out of the ocean, what, there? Correct, sir. Which gives a likely route and an area to focus our search on. Now, it 's my guess the smugglers will let them off somewhere east of Darwin. If they have n't done so already. That 's a reasonable assumption, sir. What? You do n't agree with it? The news of the Koreans is already over the wire. Now, they 'll know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east of here is going to be heavily monitored. So, where are they heading? Well, if I was master of the ship I 'd turn south-west and look for somewhere off this coast. It 's an awfully long coastline, sir. Oh, look, ' Hammersley ' can have a look in the south-west. Get onto Coastwatch, get them to get a plane up at first light. Thanks, sir. Agent Murphy. Commander. You seem to be living here. Oh, just tidying up some paperwork. Actually, I 've been meaning to talk to you. Have you heard anything recently from Ursula Morrell? The marine biologist? Well... it seems you know her a hell of a lot better than I do. Why would I have heard from her? I have reason to believe that she may have disappeared. From her home or from the city? All I know for certain is she 's moved out of her apartment. Well, it 's a free country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What if it was n't voluntary? Then... it 's a matter for local cops, mate. If you 're concerned, file a missing persons report. Oh, I just thought you might be interested, that 's all. Given that she 's connected with your investigation. What investigation? The mysterious poisoning of her colleague on Bright Island. Not so mysterious. Tragic accident. Oh, that was your conclusion, was it? Ah, Greg. Good timing. I 'm sorry. Have you finished? Yeah. We 're finished. Coastwatch have ID 'd three vessels within our search area that have containers on their decks. Here, here... and here. This one is the ' Kamakura Express ' out of Nagasaki. She did berth at Denpasar, but she 's around 7,000 TEU. Too big to have lost a container. These other two are smaller coastal traders - the ' Prins Alexander ' and the ' Pacific Mariner ' We 're unsure of their ports of call. OK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nav. If one of these ships has lost a container, it should n't be too hard to tell. Once we 're close. Er, could you give me a little bit of space here, RO? Sorry, ma'am. Coming up on our first contact, sir. Roger that, Nav. RO, commence contact procedure. I have a visual. Green five... far. I took your advice, by the way. Spoke to Agent Murphy about Ursula Morrell. I did n't get much joy there, but at least I tried. He did n't think her disappearance was suspicious? He did n't seem to react when I told him she 'd vacated her apartment. Are you saying th... What ARE you saying? I find it strange when someone ups and leaves without even a goodbye. Is that right? You really do see things in terms of black and white, do n't you, X? The ' Pacific Mariner ' is slowing, sir. I can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off her deck. Request to be part of the boarding party, sir. Go for it. Australian Navy, sir. Anyone else on board? Uh, the crew. Let me give you a hand there. Uh, that wo n't be necessary. I 'm Lieutenant McGregor from Australian warship ' Hammersley ' And your name is? Richard Gallagher. Call me Rick. Are you master of this vessel, Mr Gallagher? And its owner. We 've been tasked under the Customs Act to search vessels in this area. Would you be able to tell me what 's in these containers? I 'll show you if you like. Thank you. The captain looks a bit of a rogue. In a good way. I can see to the back. No false wall. Are you missing any containers? Uh, we unloaded these two yesterday. All in order here, X. And, uh, what about this one? Are you the commander of the ship? Executive officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not a bad drop. I 'd offer you all a bottle, but, uh... the container 's not refrigerated. These crates are stacked too tight to see in. We 'll have to pull them all out. I do n't think that 'll be necessary. I ca n't see all the way to the back, ma'am. I 'm satisfied they 're not here. I 'm not, ma'am. I recommend that we empty the container. Your recommendation is noted. Let 's wrap things up here. Ma'am, I really insist we at least take some of these... Leader, return to the RHIB. They might still be in there. Leader... They could still be alive! Return to the RHIB now. I apologise for that. No need. You handled it really well. Thank you. No. Thank YOU. It 's not every day I 'm boarded by the navy. You 've given me a great story to tell down the pub tonight. Oh! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've spotted a derelict vessel adrift a few miles south of our position. They ca n't raise anyone on VHF. Thanks, Spide. X - Ray 2, this is Charlie 2. Anything to report there? Over. Negative, sir. Everything seems to be in order here. Over. Then it 's time to head home, X. Charlie 2 out. ET. Let 's go. I hope you find what you 're looking for. You wanted to see me, ma'am? Come in. I do n't appreciate my authority being tested as you did on that boarding. I will not tolerate it. Yes, ma'am. I realise I overstepped the mark. It was out of concern for the missing Koreans. Yes. Your sensitivity has been obvious to everyone. Now, I am going to overlook it - this time only, in view of your circumstances. What circumstances? Your recent bereavement. I can only assume it caused you to behave irrationally. You 're wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my compassion on THIS occasion. X? Ma'am! I am warning you... I 'm not feeling grief. I 'm relieved. My father was a mongrel. He was emotionally and psychologically abusive. He was a drunk. And I 'm relieved he 's dead, because it gives me closure. Now, I I understand that that must seem strange to you. I know that family relationships are n't supposed to be like that. But mine mine w... RO I 'm very sorry. Ma'am, I 'm not looking for your sympathy. I 'm only telling you this because I feel I owe you an explanation for my behaviour. Your explanation is accepted. You have n't heard it yet. Dr Soong 's a decent man and I wanted to help reunite him with his family. He 's a man that DOES deserve to have a child. Derelict vessel is stationary. Range, 1,000 yards. Fishing vessel on my port bow, this is Australian warship. Channel 1-6. Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance. Pretty average up close, though, right? Very average. FAIDEX, X. Do you hear there? XO speaking. We have n't been able to raise the adrift vessel. We 're going to investigate whether assistance is required. Hands to FAIDEX stations. Hands to FAIDEX stations. That derelict fishing boat looks kind of familiar, sir. It certainly does. It belongs to your fishing mates. X - Ray 2, this is Charlie 2. What have we got? Over. There 's no sign of the two fishermen. And the boat - it 's been ransacked. Ransacked? Yeah. Totally cleaned out. Fairly suspicious, would n't you say? X. Console 's a mess. GPS, radar, fish-finder, sat phone all ripped out of their housings. What do you reckon? Pirates? What, in these waters? Anything 's possible. X! You need to see this. Ca n't believe it, eh? I was only speaking to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? If armed bandits ransacked the boat and murdered Sam, you 'd think we 'd have found Carl 's body as well. Unless this Carl bloke had something to do with it. It 's crap, ET. You saw them. They were mates. I was below when they rocked up. I did n't see anything. How well do you know these guys, Spider? Oh, apart from yesterday, I 'd only met them the once, on Bright Island. But they seemed like pretty cool dudes. Yeah, well, look, you know, we do n't know what happened on that boat. They could have taken Carl with them, as a hostage or something. Well, ca n't we keep searching, instead of going after this container ship, Buff? No. The feds ' jurisdiction now, mate. We 've got our own job to do. We conducted a handover of the boat to the Federal Police. But waiting for them has cost us precious time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bow to proper procedure. Uh, what 's your current status? We 're on a sou ' - westerly course to intercept the second vessel of interest. OK. We 've had no luck in the Arafura Sea. Getting a lot of stick from Canberra. Just keep me informed. Will do, sir. And if there 's any news from the feds on Carl Davies, I 'd appreciate it if you pass it on. Roger, mate. Contact is still bearing 2-1-5. Speed, steady at 12 knots. Range, 10 nautical miles. Would you like me to try and raise them, sir? Negative, X. I do n't want them picking up steam. Us, on the other hand - increase 24. Revolutions, 8-8-0. I have a visual right ahead. Target 's picked up speed. She 's now on a course of 2-0-5. Speed, 15 knots. That 'll be her top speed. Port 10. Steer 2-0-0. Let 's make our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian warship. Stop. Heave to. I intend to board you. Course 2-0-0, sir. Very good. ' Prins Alexander ' this is Australian warship. Stop. Heave to... ' Prins Alexander ', You have NO permission to come aboard! NO permission! That 's what he thinks. Make sure the gunner 's visible. Aye, sir. Gunner of the watch, stand to. Trading vessel on my port bow. You should stop, heave to. We intend to board you. ' Prins Alexander ' stop, heave to, or I will fire upon you. Nil response, sir. Recommend burst of fire ahead of the bow. Roger. One short burst ahead of the bow. Gunner, action! Instant. One burst of 3-5 rounds, 50 yards ahead of the bow engage! Check, check, check! Take a snatch party, X. Aye, sir. Request to be part of that snatch party, sir. Not this time, RO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! Get off my ship! You 've no right to board me! Sir! Sir, stop right there! Calm down, please, sir. I 'm Lieutenant McGregor from Australian warship ' Hammersley ' You are in Australia 's Contiguous Zone. I have EVERY right to board you. Charlie 2, this is X-Ray 2. We have the vessel under control. Low threat. We 're commencing our search now. Over. Roger, X. Charlie 2 out. Buffer. Sir, we would like to inspect your ship 's manifest. Would you send one of your crew to retrieve it, please? Sir? Your last port of call was Denpasar. Three days ago. Correct? We pick up furniture. All the paperwork 's all there. It 's no problem. All the containers are accounted for. Serial numbers match up. Does n't seem to be any discrepancies there, ma'am. Hey, Buffer. Could these have been doctored? Maybe, X. X - Ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. This is X-Ray 2. The containers would appear to be legitimate and all accounted for. Over. What 's your instinct tell you, X? I know they 're here. Over. Roger. Out. Buffer. I want everything out of this one. No! You ca n't do this! Spider! Sir, step back! Step back. There 's a false bulkhead here! X? Chefo! Chefo! Strippers. No strippers! Come on. Strippers! Chefo, there will be strippers. It 's not a buck 's turn, guys, alright? If there 's gon na be strippers, I 'm staying right here. Jen would have my goolies, and you know it. Well, she 's not going to know. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! No strippers, alright? Just a quiet night out on the town in celebration of Chefo 's engagement. Thank you, Charge. And a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's my boy! Oh, yes! Thanks. Same again, thanks. Let me guess - rum, straight up. That 's what sailors drink, right? Only at sea a hundred years ago. Now we drink... House shiraz, love. Yeah. Let me. Thank you. Is, uh, this your local? No, not usually. I 'm just looking for an audience to brag to about my big naval adventure. Adventure? Ta. Hey, that was the highlight of my month. Might just be another standard day for you. Oh, sure, yeah - in amongst, uh, communist refugees, people-smugglers, murder on the high seas. Murder? Yeah. A couple of fishermen. Their boat was ransacked. One dead, one missing. You can never be too careful out there. I 'll have to keep that in mind. Mmm. Come on. Let 's do it. Let 's go. Come on. Here he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Chefo 's engagement. Charge is in charge. Let 's go. It 'll be a good night, sir. Not tonight, Buff. Think I 'll have one quiet bevvy, then hit the sack early. Sir! Alright. You know where we 'll be! Have a good one. See you, sir. Where 's X? At the bar, sir. Look after her, sir. Get you a drink, gorgeous? Uh... Uh... no. I 'm right. Thank you!
