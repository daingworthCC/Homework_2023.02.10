5230041? The Twentieth Centruy Fox Mambo.? Previously on Smash... Might almost believe you were avoiding my calls. Eileen is pimping me out wherever she can. So if we stay open till June, that Tony is ours. You wan na get out of here? Then let 's go. Tell me what you 're doing with Gatsby. I 'm writing a play. Tom does n't wan na let go. You said we would work on this together.? Is everything you 're not? People are coming tonight who could bring this show to Broadway. It 's what we always wanted. What the hell, Derek? - This is a private audition. - For my part? You know, I 've been cleaning up your messes since we were kids. Would it have killed you to do something for me for once? - You took their side. - I have to stop helping you. You have to start helping yourself. [Tires_screeching] Are you gon na walk me home or what? [Sighs] Look at that. We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning is as good a time as any to stop. Do n't you think you should get some sleep before Sam 's put-in rehearsal in... Oh, God... Three hours? [Laughs] - I should go. - Yeah You do n't have to. Are you sure? [Serene_music]?? Do you really wan na do this? [High_and_Dry_playing]??? Two jumps in a week?? I bet you think that 's pretty clever?? do n't you, boy????? Flying on your motorcycle?? watching all the ground beneath you drop???? You 'd kill yourself for recognition?? kill yourself?? to never ever stop???? You broke another mirror?? you 're turning into something?? you are not?? Do n't leave me high?? Do n't leave me dry?? Do n't leave me high?? Do n't leave me dry???? Drying up in conversation?? you will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All your insides fall to pieces?? you just sit there wishing you could?? still make love???? They 're the ones who hate you?? when you think you 've got the world?? all sussed out???? Oh, they 're the ones who 'll spit at you?? yeah, you will be the one?? screaming out?? Do n't leave me high?? Do n't leave me dry?? Do n't leave me high?? Do n't leave me dry?? Oh, it 's the best thing that you ever had?? The best thing that you ever, ever had?? It 's the best thing that you ever had?? - The best thing you have? - had has gone away? [Sighs] What are you doing? Now, I know that you probably do n't wan na see me right now... You look terrible. Did you even sleep? Have you spoken to Kyle? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say to you. I think you said everything you needed to say to me last night. I know, I know. I was a total ass. I always am. I ruin everything. I told you that when you met me. And that 's what you say to make it okay. I do n't wan na hurt you anymore. All right, just tell me, what do I need to do to be the person that you saw in me? Because when you look at me like that, I... I know that 's who I really am. Karen, you okay out there? - Oh, okay. - Jimmy! Jimmy! No... It 's Kyle. Leave a message. Hey, it 's Tom. Um, I thought we were gon na meet up last night, but, uh, I never heard from you. Listen, if you 're not interested, uh, I guess I 'll understand, but just let me know. Ugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a teenager. [Elevator_dings] Oh, my God! I 'm going to delete this and re-record the message. Sorry! Sorry we 're late! The line at Starbucks was atrocious. Um, the line was fine. She had to stop and sign autographs and pose for pictures. She did everything short of bless a baby. - I did that yesterday. - [Laughs] Oh, good! You 're all here. Everyone ready to talk Tony? Yeah, yeah! Where 's Julia? Yeah, uh, how are you guys doing after last night? We 're fine. Let 's start without her. [Inhaling] What 's this? A declaration of war from Tom. It 's a move to dissolve our partnership. Really? It lists every name of every title we have ever optioned, including Gatsby. So he 's gon na tie it up for months, so you ca n't do it? For him to move this fast, he must be really angry. Well, do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, ' cause I need you to. If I pull this play, I 'll lose my job. I know. Look at this. Right back where we were 15 years ago... My fate in your hands. Not mine, Tom 's. You will talk to him, right? Reason with him? Look, I may have burned you 15 years ago, but I 'm not gon na do it again. And I wo n't let Tom do it either. As we get closer to the Tonys, things are looking up for Bombshell. Imitation of Life is closing, which is n't a very good omen. Uh, Harold and Maude is struggling to retain the magic it had on the West End. And if Road House gets a nomination, I 'm gon na retire. [Laughter] Drood and Pippin are contenders. No, not for best musical. They 're revivals. - I meant for directing. - Ah, ah, ah. What about Hit List? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end its run where it began last month... Downtown. So it 's official, sweetie. We 're the show to beat. And the key to staying that way is marketing. Subways, billboards... This fabulous ad that you took out in the times. I did n't place a full-page ad in the Times. Then who did? Jerry. Do n't get upset. We need all the help we can get. Not from him we do n't. That is a great ad. Look at that. You 're up there twice. Yeah, but supporting for Liaisons? We closed in a week. With glorious reviews for you. You were a bright light in a bad show. Do n't think the nominating committee wo n't notice. But that puts me up against you. That 's right. [Acoustic_guitar_ringtone] It would be embarrassing to beat my own daughter. Kyle, that was fast. Guess I still got it. [Indistinct_chatter] So are we gon na talk about what happened? Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your definition of " nothing. " He 's no good for you, you know that. And you are? Oh, God. What do we tell everyone? We do n't have to tell them anything. - Tom. - Hey! What 's wrong? Um... I called, uh, Kyle this morning. We... Well... Uh, he called me back, but it was n't him. It was the police. He got hit by a car last night. - Oh, my God. - Shh. He 's gone. [Soft_music] Smash 02x14 The Phenomenon Original Air Date May 4, 2013 Kyle : I wish I knew how to fix this. Because Amanda 's death does not work. - We 're missing something. - Like what? Like, um, like a chance for the audience to grieve. Um, a tribute or a candlelight vigil. Maudlin. She ca n't just die. You wan na know she mattered. What about dimming of the lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved that tradition. You do? When I was in school, we went to a show the night they dimmed them - for Wendy Wasserstein. - [Clicks_tongue] And I just thought it was such an elegant and beautiful gesture. Um, could she sing another number even though she 's dead? Ha, you know, I knew that was terrible, - even as I said it. - [Laughing] She ca n't. But he could. The song she stole from him. The Love I Meant To Say? She dies in the arms of the man who loved her, as he sings the song that brought them together in the first place. That would be incredibly moving. Yes, it will. You 're good at this, Kyle. You keep having ideas like that, they might just dim the lights for you yet. And that 's all we know for now. How you doing? [Groans] I do n't care about me. I 'm worried about them though. Has anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let ' em know that we 're here if they need anything. I can... I can do it. I 'll call them. No. We 'll do it together. Come on. Hey. I tried Jimmy. He 's not answering. Maybe you should try him. Yeah, if he 's not picking up for you, I do n't think he 's gon na pick up for me. Hi. So what do we do about tonight 's performance? We cancel, obviously. Are you sure? Uh, yeah, I think " The show must go on " is n't apropos at this particular moment, Scott. Sam has n't even had time to rehearse. Everyone 's devastated. I 'm not sure anyone is in a position to perform. But Hit List is Kyle 's show. I mean, I ca n't think of a... a better way to honor him. Absolutely not! I 'm not turning this into a bloody requiem. We are canceled, got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... let 's go call the ticket holders. Where are you going? There 's something I need to do for Kyle. Such a tragedy. So young. Too young. We need to be very sensitive about this. We do n't wan na be silent, but we do n't wan na look like we 're jumping on any kind of grief parade either. Tony Vot... Agnes, I think we need to take a break from the Tony campaign for today. Of course. [Knocking_on_door] Julia! I 'll leave you two. - I 'm sorry for your loss. - Thank you. [Sniffles] That 's why I 'm here. [Sighs] Kyle lived for Broadway. I wan na try and get him a little piece of that dream, get the lights of the marquees dimmed tonight. It 's only awarded to Broadway veterans. I know, I know. I can reach out to a couple of people, but... I know what they 'll say. Thank you. Still nothing? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still does n't know. - He 'll turn up. - He was wired this morning. He ca n't find out the wrong way. It 's okay, we 'll tell him. As gently as possible. And whatever he needs, we 'll be there for him no matter what. Thank you, Derek. Do n't thank me for doing the right thing. [Sighs] Jimmy. Yeah, yeah, it 's me. The guy that ruined your show. Well, wrote it, then ruined it. But who really cares about that part, right? Do n't freak out. I 'm just getting my stuff, and then you 'll never... have to see me again. I promise. God, you still do n't know? Know what? What, how much you guys probably hate me? Like, how disappointed Kyle is? ' Cause trust me, I know. He kicked me out. He wo n't answer his phone, and he was n't home this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? What is it now? Kyle 's dead. He was hit by a car last night. What? Okay, come on. That 's screwed up, Blake. Jimmy 's here. Come quick. Where is he? We told him, and he just left. You let him leave? What was I supposed to do, block the door? If he needs to be alone, he should be alone. No, that 's exactly what he should n't be. Kyle : What are you doing up? I was about to ask you the same thing. Ugh. I have this thing where when I have an idea, I have to write it down immediately, or it 's gone. And what idea did you have? Um, I always wanted to put these transitions between songs in Hit List. Sort of, um, social media subtitles to walk you through the story behind the story. Did n't you open already? Well, yeah, but theater 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does. You have to put the pen down at some point. I had to with Bombshell. Oh, really? ' Cause I have notes. [Laughing] Oh, do you, now? Well, one, actually. Okay, in At Your Feet, when Gladys takes Norma Jeane to the Chinese Theater, why does she have to just leave her there? ' Cause that 's the way it happened. Well but it 's sad, it 's, like, right there, the second number in the show, this melancholy chord. It 's the truth. And sometimes the truth is too hard. Sometimes, you wan na remember things better than they actually were. Which is what I think Marilyn wants to do when she remembers her past. Why do n't you come back to bed? I still have a little more. [Clears_throat] [Playing_upbeat_number] At Your Feet. Feel free to sing along. So you 're gon na try to pull my focus, are you? [Playing_Vienna]?? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're so ambitious for a juvenile?? but then if you 're so smart?? tell me, why are you still so afraid?? mmm?? Where 's the fire, what 's the hurry about?? you better cool it off before you burn it out?? you got so much to do?? and only so many hours in a day?? hey?? But you know that when the truth is told?? that you can get what you want or you can just get old?? You 're gon na kick off?? before you even get halfway through?? mm-hmm?? When will you realize?? Vienna waits for you?? Slow down, you 're doing fine?? you ca n't be everything you want to be?? before your time?? although it 's so romantic on the borderline tonight?? tonight?? Too bad, but it 's the life you lead?? you 're so ahead of yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see when you 're wrong?? you know you ca n't always see when you 're right?? you 're right?? You got your passion, you got your pride?? but do n't you know that only fools are satisfied?? Dream on, but do n't imagine they 'll all come true?? mm-hmm?? When will you realize?? Vienna waits for you?? Why do n't you realize?? Vienna waits for you??? You know, I 've never been serenaded before. [Song_ends] What did you think? Tom? Tom? [Sighs] Julia... I am so sorry. We all are. I really appreciate that. I almost did n't come here ' cause... Talking about business at this moment just feels... wrong. - Maybe we should postpone. - No. I mean, the sooner we get it over with, the better. I do n't know what 's happening to you, Tom. We have one fight last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that 's what we did last night, dissolve the partnership. If you 're trying to stop me from working... - Stop you? - I promise... I will fight you. This is gon na help you. Julia, if you wan na Gatsby, we have to dissolve the partnership, so you can re-option it on your own. Right now, thanks to you, I hold half the rights. But you do n't wan na be running every little decision you make through me. The sooner we separate it, the better. For you. And me. Oh. So... Was that everything, or is that it for today 's installment of " Tom the Monster "? Uh, no, that 's it. Thanks. All right, then. Cathie, can you find Linda for me? There 's something I wan na take a look at. Mmhmm. [Indistinct_chatter] Wait, wait, wait, wait. Whoops. Well... I can guess why you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes, I did. Oof. Should I duck? You know, I was n't very happy about that. I do n't appreciate these little stunts of yours. That 's not a stunt. I put a lot of money into Bombshell, and I have a lot more. I wan na do something with it, something that will make a difference. I knew you 'd say no if I asked. Well, you have n't even tried. All right. Do you want more money? [Chuckles] Of course not. I went into the wrong business. I should 've been a psychic. Bombshell is mine, Jerry. And I 'm gon na take it all the way to the Tonys without your help. Stay away from my show. Am I clear? And here I thought the ice between us might be melting. [Gasps] No, it 's as cold as ever. - I ca n't believe it. - It 's amazing. [Indistinct_chatter] - Julia. - What 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Yes, but they 're coming anyway. They want the show. - How did they even find out? - Who knows? Maybe we should go on tonight. Maybe it 's what everybody needs. I know I 'm probably the hundredth person to ask you this today, but how you doing? Are you holding up? Oh, I have to. Not with me. There are ticket holders lined up outside. We canceled the show, but they turned up anyway. What are you gon na do? I have no idea. [Scoffs] I 'm sitting in the kind of place that I never thought I 'd go back to ' cause of a sweet kid who ca n't be here to enjoy the rest of it. You know I 'm good at putting on a front, but... I 'm not good at caring this much. What if I were there? What, to hold my hand? Look, I know we left things in a weird place, but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter? It 's just a play, right? That play is the only thing he has left. You 're going to put it on, and I 'm gon na be there for you. have n't you got a show tonight? I think I 'm feeling a tickle in my throat. [Chuckles] You 'd do that... for me? I would. Okay, everyone. Can I have your attention, please? I think we 've all had a chance to honor Kyle in silence, and now, we need to honor him up on that stage. It seems it 's what the people want. So we 'll do a concert, okay? Just the piano, music stands. That way, you 'll know what you 're doing. Thank you. What about Karen? Is n't she here? Where is she? I do n't know. All right, okay. Just give me a minute. Excuse me, guys. Yeah. I ca n't find him. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible might happen. Karen... There 's just one last place I got ta check, somewhere Kyle told me he used to go.? It 's show time, let the dream begin?? with each star who 's ever been?? step inside the footsteps that you should? Fol... All :? fol...? -? low...? all :? low...? -? in? all :? doo wop?? so I leave you in the best of hands?? in this most Chinese of wonderlands?? your dreams will truly be complete?? when the stars that you 're wishing on are?? at? all :? at?? your feet?? ai n't she sweet? [Cheers_and_applause] That was a really nice change, by the way. - Yeah. - What made you think of it? - A friend. - Mm. What happened to Ivy? When did she call out? She went home sick an hour ago. Saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask me, she was fine at half-hour too. Ah. Of course. Jimmy! You 're not thinking of doing something stupid, are you? No. Then come down. Jimmy! Fine. I 'm coming up. What are you... no! What are you doing? You should n't be sitting up here. Yeah, well... [Scoffs] Neither should you. It 's my fault. You know, he 's dead because of me. No, he 's not. It was an accident. But he was coming to talk to me, Karen. I ca n't imagine what you 're going through. I ca n't even believe it happened myself, but... But what? What? You gon na try to make it better? Is that what you think you 're doing here? I 'm just trying to help. Why would I ever let you help me? Is this about Derek? Nothing happened. Okay, I stopped it before it did. I... I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm in love with you. I wish I was n't, but I am. I love you, okay? You should n't love me. I do n't deserve it. Come back with me. Come do the show. - I can't. - Yes, you can. - You need to. - No, no, I do n't. Jimmy, I know you. Do n't throw everything away. No matter what you do, it 's not gon na make it hurt less. Come and face what happened. We can deal with it together, you and me. I... I 'm already late. I have to... I 'm gon na go. Okay? I 'll see you there? [Indistinct_chatter] I ca n't believe everyone showed up even after you called to cancel. We didn't. - Did n't what? - Cancel. Scott said you changed everybody 's mind. He had me call the ticket holders back and tell ' em we would be putting on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, did you not do that? We 'll have to finish this interview later, okay, Frank? No problem, I wan na see the show myself. Julia, I was just coming downstairs to stand next to you. I know what you did. I 'll see you both downstairs. - You lied. - No, I did n't. Yes, you did. And you used me to do it. Saying I turned the cast around, so the show would go on? [Sighs] You exploited that poor boy 's death, and for what? For him, for his show. For yourself, to keep your job! It is not my fault that this happened. But if it keeps his work alive, why should n't we do this? You saw what was happening out there. We 're a phenomenon. People are going to remember this night forever. Julia... You know how much I need this to work. I hope it does. ' Cause now, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't wait any longer. He 'll be here. - Look, we 're late as it is. - Derek, five more minutes. Karen. He 's not coming. Okay. Okay, guys, um... Look, I know things are pretty intense right now, and, um... I know that going out on that stage might feel like a mistake. But I assure you, it is not. There 's a lot of people out there that wan na hear what you have to say. And more than that, they wan na hear what Kyle had to say. and you guys... you 're the only ones that have the power to tell them. So... do him proud. [Indistinct_chatter] Remember when this place used to be cool? [Scoffs] Now, it 's just a bunch of condos. - Focus on your work. - Why should I? It 's not like anything 's gon na come of it. Oh, my... Yes, it is! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a second act, and we 're on our way. How can you be so sure? I 'm not. I just pretend that I am. [Laughs] Hey. You know what? Maybe we should set a scene here. It 's kind of our place, you know? What about when they meet for the first time, when Amanda tries to kill herself and Jesse stops her by singing The Love I Meant To Say? Yeah. Yeah, and then when she gives it all up to be with him, they come back here right before she dies. Are you sure she has to die? Musicals usually have happy endings. [Scoffs] Not the ones you like. You 're right. Then she must die... Ha. So that your character can learn something.? I 'm high above the city?? I 'm standing on the ledge?? The view from here is pretty?? and I step off the e...? do n't do it! [Audience_murmuring] No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na do it. Okay, so let 's do it. Yeah. Okay. He wants to do the song. [Snaps] [Soft_guitar_music]??? Over?? I ca n't believe it 's over???? I ca n't believe the love I left???? to show some other day???? Listen?? I hope that you?? can hear me?? as I kneel down and pray?? with the love I meant?? to say???? Shadows?? You took away?? the shadows?? before you, life was black and white?? though tonight the room 's?? gone gray???? Golden?? all the love you gave was golden???? Gold that I would gladly pay?? to show the love I meant to say???? Oh?? music?? you made me hear such?? music?? without you here to guide me? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @???? Sorry?? that 's the word I wan na sing to you???? the other word is?? stay?? to hear the love?? I meant?? to say??? [Song_ends] Hey! what_do youthink? Ca n't wait for act two, right? Yeah, it 's good. It 's really good. I 'll just admit it 's a little strange for me. Um, ' cause she 's better? - Karen, I 'm kidding. - No, you 're not. - [Laughing] - That 's so rude. Hey, um, did Jimmy talk to you? I told him not to. I thought it might scare you away. - It didn't. - I 'm glad. Are you? ' Cause sometimes I feel like you think I 'm in the way or something. Maybe a little, at first. But then I saw how happy you make him. And, um... Look, I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about you. Maybe you can fix what I could n't. [Cheers_and_applause] [Indistinct_chatter] The show was amazing. Thank you. Technically it was n't all me. Wow. That might be the first time you 've ever said something like that. [Laughing] How does it feel? What happened with us? One minute, we were hanging out, and then you were gone. Derek, I do n't think right now... Please just... I need to know. The night of my birthday... I know the only reason you came to see me is because Karen rejected you. Karen? Wow, okay. Um, well, there 's nothing going on there. I was at her apartment the whole of last night, and I slept on the couch because of you. I just came as a friend. That 's it. Do n't walk away from me because of Karen. It 's not Karen. It 's you. You 'll always have a Karen. It 's just who you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Two minutes. - This was a great idea, Tom. You are definitely not a monster. Not today, at least. Jerry! What are you doing here? I saw Hit List tonight. Scott invited me. Did you like it? I think it 's a great story. So do I. And also, I was thinking what a lovely gesture that was, putting the ad in the paper. Thank you. You, thanking me? To what do I owe this? Well, the reminder that life is shorter than we think it is. Does this mean we 're friends again? [Scoffs] No. But you can be a friend to Bombshell... If the money 's still on the table. Oh, I 'm sorry. That money 's no longer available. I committed it to something else. - To what? - To Hit List. I 'm moving it to Broadway. We start previews at the end of the month. You 're right, you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This way, I can take that Tony away from you and not feel guilty. What are you doing after this? Do you wan na go somewhere to talk? Um... Y-you know, I ca n't. Okay. Maybe tomorrow? Yeah, I mean, I just have a lot to deal with. Are are you mad at me about something? No. No, of course not. What about what you said to me this morning? You guys do n't have glasses. Uh, actually, no, I 'm not drinking anymore, so... You can have one. Go ahead, celebrate. I mean, you 're going to Broadway, right? [Sighs], chuckles - Here we go. - Okay. Okay, can you hold this? Yep. [Soft_music]?? Tom : Well, we could n't get all of Broadway to dim but... they ca n't stop us from using our own house. To Kyle. All : To Kyle.
