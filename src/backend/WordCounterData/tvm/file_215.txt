5261241 What happened? Are you okay? Yeah. Nothing a little sleep ca n't fix. - Here, let me heal that. - No. - Come on. - I said no. Piper, this is ridiculous. We have to talk about this. Actually, what we need to do is find where the next demon attack is gon na be, and I think I just did. A pentagram, naturally. What do you want from me? What do I have to do to prove that I 've changed, that I 'm okay? Did Phoebe and Paige finish making the dye? You did n't answer my question. Oh, I have to answer your questions, but you do n't have to answer mine? What question? The same question I 've been asking you for several days now. What are n't you telling me? I do n't know what you 're talking about. Oh. Right. Excuse me. I ca n't get into this right now with you, okay? I 've got an invisible demon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be working with the Avatars. They 're not working with the Avatars. Oh, yeah? How do you know? I do n't! I mean, I just... I do n't think they 're the threat everyone thinks they are. Why? Because, if they 're so powerful, would n't they have attacked by now? Oh, sending a demon to possess you does n't count? Still, I think that was their way of communicating with me, with us. Why did n't they just try calling you, Leo? Are you hiding something? No. Yes. Are you sure those are gon na work? Yeah. As sure as I can be at 5 a.m. Before you go - Do you know where the demon 's gon na attack? They 're making a pentagram, and there 's only one point left, so we need to get there before sunrise. Piper, you ca n't walk out on this! You 're right. We should orb. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said : NO! What happened? Nothing a little sleep wo n't fix. It 's fine. Did n't you just say that? What? Nothing. I think I found where the next demon attack is gon na be. A pentagram, naturally. Did Phoebe and Paige finish that dye yet? I do n't know. Excuse me. Why did you do this? We did n't. You did. You need to be more careful about your new powers, Leo. Reversing time can be very dangerous. Charmed Season 7 Episode 09 " There 's something about Leo " Transcript : Intrepid. Synchro : Greatouille. Our powers are not meant to be used for personal reasons, Leo. You know that. I know. I did n't mean to. It just happened. Yes, because you wanted it to happen. You must be more careful in the future, learn to control your emotions. Control is the first discipline of an Avatar. Otherwise, our powers can become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. What do you mean? Reversing time the way you did requires great power. It drains the Collective, and it puts us at risk. And we must remain at full strength if we are to defeat the forces of evil, if we are to implement the change. I get that, but Piper 's my wife. She knows something 's up. I ca n't keep lying to her. We understand your position, Leo... But to tell her outright might cause her to overreact and mistakenly view us as a threat. As might her sisters as well. They must come to the truth in their own time and in their own way, just as you did. What if they do n't? What if Piper never sees the future you promised? You must help her to see it, Leo. You must gently guide her to it. This is the burden that you took upon becoming an Avatar. I 'm not just an Avatar. I 'm a Husband, and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that back. And you will get it back, Leo. You will, once we have ended this perpetual battle between good and evil, once we have brought forth a better way. Okay, it 's almost dawn, and nothing 's happening. Can we go home and go to sleep now? Shh. Just stay focused. Right, focused. Maybe you drew the pentagram wrong. I know how to draw a pentagram, thank you. Yeah, but did you use a felt marker? The thickness of the tip led us astray a couple of blocks, huh? We are not going home. What 's the matter with you guys? Do you wan na save an innocent or not? Of course we do. It 's just, uh... What? It 's just what? Now you 're not telling me something? Leo 's what. What? We just think that you may have been so eager to avoid Leo that you miscalculated the demon attack. What she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may be avoiding Leo, but that does not mean I am wrong about this. Why? Why are you so upset with him? He 's been an Angel lately. Yeah, well, that 's the problem. He 's been too perfect, even for him, and I just keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. Why do n't you just talk to him about it? I have, about a dozen times, and he just thinks I 'm crazy or something, which is why I am channeling my frustration into something useful. I just want this demon to attack soon, so I can make my breakfast date with Kyle. Yeah, see, breakfast is not a date. Dinner 's a date. Lunch is definitely maybe a date. Breakfast? Always just breakfast. As long as he does n't talk about the Avatars, it can be breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and I will consider it a date. Who is calling you at this hour? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? We 're about to find out. Get the dye. They have to become visible to attack. Let 's go. Who the hell are you? It wo n't matter. Kill them. Throw the dye! Energy ball! Heads up, guys. Well, that did n't go too well. They were a lot more powerful than I thought. He 's still alive. Okay, let 's get him to magic school, and we 'll find out who they are. And make more potions. The innocent has been marked and territory staked. Soon, every mortal within the pen will be ours alone to prey upon. But the innocent lives. Our rivals - Can no more easily kill than we can... now that The Charmed Ones are protecting him. Then how is the territory staked? As long as he lives, the Sokols could still try to claim it for themselves. And we want them to try... or, at least, make it look like they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Right. So we 'll put them on our rivals ' trail... by making them think the Sokols attacked them. So, this place is great. Yeah? Y-you sure? I mean, you - - you like the place? Well, I 've never had breakfast here, but I 'm... I 'm sure it 's terrific. I guess I should 've asked you out to dinner, huh? It 's fine. I 'm up this early anyway. Well, you know, I figured since we got the first kiss out of the way and everything... Out of the way? Sorry. I did n't mean that. I did not mean that. I... I... I just, you know, I 'm rusty. All Avatars all the time? Yeah, something like that. It 's just that I 've been chasing them for so long, you know? It has n't left much time for a social life. Well, um, maybe it 's time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes, I think. It 's just that they 're so close, Paige. I mean, I know it, you know? I-I can feel it. But... you promised. You 're right. You 're right. That 's it. No more Avatar talk, I swear. Good. That 's a good start. What? It 's, uh - - it 's vibrating. It just tickles a little, that 's all. It 's off. I promise. No more distractions. That 's my emergency line. I got ta take this. Sorry. Brody. What? All right, as soon as you get those numbers, you call me, all right? Intel just detected another unusual power spike in the area. Paige, this could mean some serious Avatar activity. Do n't you know what this means? Yeah... yeah, I do. It means that you eat alone. I 'm sorry. Paige, come on. Idiot! You know, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much you could get done. I mean, already today, I 've made demon dye. I 've saved an innocent. I e-mailed in my column, plucked my eyebrows If it was n't for sleep deprivation, I would be okay. What about the demons? Yeah, I could n't find anything in the book to help identify them. But I did get to read up on the family history. Did you know that Beatrice Warren only had one leg? What is this? You making spaghetti sauce? No. That 's, uh, demon blood. I got it from the salvage yard. I was gon na use it to scry for them after I make the vanquishing potion. Wow. Jacklebeet. So, exactly which state are you trying to blow off the map? I do n't wan na take any chances. We need two kitchens. Do you know where the beetle toe is? I think it 's up in the attic. Boy, when you 're avoiding something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? I seem to remember someone doing some avoiding a little while back. Yeah, if you 're talking about Leslie, you 're absolutely right. But my big sister gave me some advice that I 'm gon na give back to you. Stop dodging. Just talk to Leo. On the subject of dodging, who called this morning? Yeah. See, your " I 'm covering something " look has n't worked since the sixth grade, so spill. Ok, but you ca n't tell Paige, ' cause I do n't want her to get all paranoid. Why would she get all paranoid? Darryl actually thinks Brody had something to do with Sheridan 's disappearance. Yeah. That 's why I 'm keeping it low-key. Darryl 's on his way over. We 're gon na talk about it while Paige is on her date. Oh, he 's talking to us again? Kind of. Baby steps. I 'll be in the attic. Well, go talk to her, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this a good time to talk? Uh, actually, yeah. Paige is out on a date. What did you find out? Nothing. Nothing. Okay, well, nothing is good, right? No. I mean, I ca n't find anything. It 's like Sheridan 's disappeared off the face of the earth. What are you saying? I think that maybe Brody did something to make Sheridan disappear... Something bad, maybe. No. I do n't believe that. That 's because you do n't want to believe that. Brody may have saved your butts... I get that... but if he did something to hurt Sheridan... wrong is wrong. Okay. Well, maybe I can get a premonition and see where she is. No. No magic. I told you. I 've done some soul-searching. I wan na help again, but I do n't wan na go there anymore. Darryl, you got ta get over this. I mean, really, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good, can it? Hey, Paige. Hey, Darryl. Uh, I thought you were on your date. Yeah. So did I. Look, um... tell Piper I said hello, okay? Take care. Take care. We 're friends again? Yeah. Weird. Bygones. Leo, please, this is not the time or place. I just want my family back, Piper. I just want you back. I do n't wan na talk about this right now. Why not?! Because this is a little dicey here, okay? I know that, and that 's why we need to talk. No, not that, this. If I make one mistake, I can blow up the entire house, okay? So, this is a bad time. I just wish you 'd trust me. Yeah, well, maybe you should try telling me the truth. This is so frustrating. This ca n't keep happening, Leo. We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I ca n't keep doing this. You must keep up pretenses. There 's no other way. There is another way. I could tell her the truth. - Leo... - You do n't understand. I know Piper. She does n't wan na live like this any more than I do. She hates hunting demons all the time. She wants nothing but the best for herself, for her family, for all of us. She can handle the truth. I know she can. But if she ca n't, if she 's not open to our way, it would risk everything we hope to achieve, everything we covet. And cause her to lose perspective in the process, ignore what should n't be ignored. Which would put her at risk as well. There 's too much at stake, Leo. She can handle it. He needs to see for himself. But what of the risk? It 's no greater than that of him... tapping into the collective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes wrong, everything may be lost. Our powers are not inexhaustible. What is the matter? I, uh -- I need to tell you something. I 'm listening. Well, the reason I know the demons are n't working with the Avatars is... is because I 'm an Avatar. What? Oh, my god. Piper? No! You stay away from me. What happened? - Let me help. - Do n't! Piper, please. Can someone please just tell us what happened? The potion blew up, and, uh, Leo 's an Avatar. What?! What? Oh, you know, the gathering storm, looming threat, that would be Leo. We 're not a threat. We 're trying to save the world from itself. Wait... did he just say " we "? I think he just said " we. " You know, you wanted the truth, and I told you. They said you had to come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it. Handle what, that you 're what everybody is afraid of, even the Elders? They 're afraid because they do n't understand. They ca n't understand. The Avatars are beyond Good and Evil. They 're everything we 've been searching for, a life without demons. Okay, he 's cracked. Absolutely. No. I have never been more clear about anything in my life. Piper, I beg you not to be closed to this. It 's everything we 've been searching for, everything we wanted, I promise. I think you need to take the boys to Magic School. - But... - Please. I need time to think about all of this. Are you sure you can trust him? I can trust my husband with our children. Now, please, go. Do you think he 's telling the truth? It would be a really stupid lie if he was n't, do n't you think? Sorry. It 's okay. What are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a demon to vanquish first and an innocent to protect, so... Yeah, but - Look, just remake the potion for me, and I 'll go get cleaned up, and be careful of the beetletoe. Okay, we have bigger things to worry about than potions. I agree. We have to save Leo. Yeah. We 're gon na have to ask for Kyle 's help. Now what? Put them on. Why? Because we 're going to attack The Charmed Ones next. Malvoc, that 's suicide. Only if we die, but I only plan to fight long enough for them to identify us, as Sokols. Then our enemies becomes their enemies. Fine. They 'll vanquish them, but others will still come to challenge us for the territory. They wo n't be able to after we kill the innocent. Those ancient rules are etched in... brimstone. And after they vanquish our rivals, they 'll think the threat to the innocent has passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these. Something 's happened, Leo. Look, I do n't have time for this. I have to get back to Pip -- We 've detected a power surge, a time shift. That could only mean one thing. The Avatars are making their move. How do you know it 's them? Because no demon has this kind of power, not since the Source. So... What do you want from me? We want you to alert The Charmed Ones. We expect that the Avatars will be coming after them first. What is it? Nothing. I just do n't know how much we know about ' em, that 's all. We know they 're a threat. Why, because they have power? Yes. The kind of power that in the wrong hands could be a danger to us all. Ok, so, are we a threat? I 'm sorry. Elders. I mean, we have a great power, but we 're only a threat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that we do n't know enough about them to fear them. How do we know they 're not a benevolent power I mean, who are we to judge them before even meeting them? If they were benevolent, they would n't lurk, insidiously waiting to make their move. They would show themselves. This is no time to lose your faith in all that we 're about, Leo, despite all that 's happened in the past. We need you on our side. Have you seen Phoebe and Paige? Are n't they upstairs making potions? No. How are the boys? They 're fine. Miss Donovan 's with them. And the innocent? Sleeping, still under the effects of the potions. How are you? How am I? I mean, with all this. I do n't know. I have questions. Well, you can ask me. I can answer them now. What are they exactly? Or should I say, what are you exactly? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wants nothing but the best for his family. And the Avatars are gon na give us that how? By using their powers... our powers... to change what has always been, to remake what is. That sounds like a load of crap. I know it does, but it 's not. You know, for all we know, they 're exactly like everything else we 've been fighting. They wan na end everything we 've been fighting against, put an end to the struggle once and for all. That 's impossible. I know. I used to think it was, too, but now I know it 's not. They wan na make the world better for everybody. And those floating heads that tormented you, they made your life better? That was just a way to... get my attention, make me open to a new idea. Leo... Piper. Think about it. A demon-free world? It 's everything we always dreamed about. Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been through? Just a graze. They really want that innocent. I just wish I knew why. There 'll be more of them. Yeah, well, at least we have a way to find them now. I do n't mean just them, Piper. I mean demons. And they 'll just keep coming back, over and over, just like they always have, unless we let the Avatars stop it... Forever. Oh, Paige. I was, uh... Okay. I 'm sorry about breakfast. Ok, I did n't handle it well. And... and, look, I know what you 're gon na say. I 'm obsessed about the Avatars. I know. That 's not it! It 's just that -- Look, it 's not gon na happen again. All right? I promise. It 's not that! Leo 's an Avatar! He told us this morning. What? How? We do n't know. He... he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on us this morning. We do n't know exactly what it means. Where are you going? Parking sucks in this city! How 's he taking it? Hello? It 's Darryl. I 'm stumped. Maybe you could use a little hocus-pocus to find out what Brody did with Sheridan. Ok, uh, but now 's not really a good time, so can I call you back in a little bit? All right. Bye. What are you looking for? This. Does he know where the Others are? " Others " who? The other Avatars! No. He did n't say. Why? What is that? It 's a potion. For what? For killing Avatars. Where is he? Kyle, would you stop, please? We are not gon na let you kill Leo. You do n't understand. He 's an Avatar now. No, he 's actually our brother-in-law. How can you be so sure the potion 's even gon na work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why. One potion. That 's all you have. You can not get even with them all. Oh, the hell I ca n't. Their powers are all tied together. You kill one of them, it weakens them all. They become vulnerable. This is ridiculous! Leo did not kill your parents! If he 's one of them, he did. He just became one of them! Look, we did n't come to you so you can kill Leo. We came to you to help us get rid of them. This is the only way to get rid of them. When my parents uncovered this, they did n't just discover a potion. They discovered a battle that happened five thousand years ago over our very future. They fought the Avatars then, and we got ta fight ' em now. What happened in here? Piper? Upstairs! At least we know she 's okay. Well, looks like the demons did n't wait for us to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know the Avatars did n't do it, huh? You know, he 'll kill you first. You wo n't even be able to get that bottle out of your hand. We 'll see. Look, I get that this is about your parents. I do, really. Yes! It is about my parents, and, no, you do n't get it. The hell I do n't. My parents were killed, too, remember? Paige, my parents were murdered. Look... Leo is not the bad guy here. For all we know, he was... he was brainwashed or possessed or something. Just, please, give us a minute. Just wait down here. Please? Just do n't let him go, all right? I 've spent twenty years looking for the Avatars. I 'm not about to lose them now. Piper, what happened? Are you okay? No thanks to you. What is that supposed to mean? What it means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potion when we were ambushed, a vanquishing potion that you were supposed to make, by the way. Where the hell were you? I was at Kyle 's. What were you doing there? Frankly? Trying to save you. Trying to save me. I do n't need saving. I know what I 'm doing. Do you know Kyle 's parents were killed by the Avatars? That 's impossible. It goes against everything they believe in. Well, you 're gon na have to come up with a better argument than that if you go downstairs. Why is that? He 's downstairs? Why is he downstairs? You do n't wan na know. He thinks you 're a threat, Leo, to all of us. Well, he 's wrong. How do you know? Because! Look, I know this is a shock to everyone, but he did n't have to tell us the truth. He would n't have if it was a bad thing. Piper, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being bad. Even the Elders think so. Because they do n't understand. So, what, we 're just supposed to take your word for it? How do we know you 're not possessed or something right now? Come on. No, Leo, I 'm serious! How do we know? Because they have n't threatened anything we believe in! It 's all good. We at least need to think about it. Since when did you jump on this Avatar train? When I started thinking about what my kids ' lives would be like fighting the battles we 've been fighting our entire lives. But it 's what we do. It 's what we were born to do. That does not mean we have to die doing it. Yeah, maybe you should try to talk to Kyle, hear his side of the story. I do n't need to. I need to vanquish demons again. Now what? How is it you 're the only one who still lives? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what happened to them! Something... is not right! Why would Malvoc attack only to retreat? How would that help him get to the innocent? Lose something? What was that? All part of the package. That was a lot of power. Yeah, but it 's used wisely. See, the Avatars could destroy us or force us to change, but they do n't. Is n't that enough reason to trust them? How could you let him go? How could you let the Avatar go? Okay, he 's still Leo, so would you stop referring to him as " The Avatar, " please? All right, we got ta fix this, and we got ta fix it fast. Now, where did he go? I do n't know. He orbed out with Piper. But how do you know he did n't go to alert the others? How are we supposed to stop them? He did n't. I promise. How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure? I can not believe you guys let him get away! Okay. Something is wrong. He 's not acting like himself. I think you need to orb that potion away from him before he does something stupid. What if he flips out? I think he already has flipped out, Pai -- What did you do?! It 's just a tranq. She 'll be fine. What are you doing? I 'm killing an Avatar, and nobody 's gon na stop me. He should wake up in a couple minutes. Thanks, Piper. For? For believing in me. I always have. I always will. It 's the only way -- I know. Thanks for helping. What just happened? We vanquished them! No, we did n't. Yeah, we did. No, we vanquished the wrong ones. He had different markings. What do you mean? We were tricked. Yeah, well, we would n't have been if Paige and Phoebe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paige? She 's fine. You and I are gon na have a little chat. Let 's just take a deep breath here. We can talk this out. Leo... I do n't want to hurt her, but I will if I have to. Your kind is responsible for a nightmare that wo n't go away, for all those nights waking up in a sweat begging that the flashbacks were just a dream. Kyle, please. It 's not a dream, though, is it, Leo? You Avatars are as real as the air that we breathe and just as vacant. My parents were viciously murdered by them. So if I were you, Leo, I 'd do what I say. The Avatars could n't have killed your parents, Kyle. They believe in peace. I 'm gon na give you three seconds to summon one of your buddies here, so I can kill them. If you do n't, I 'm gon na kill you. I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Kyle. Two... Leo! Three! No! Leo? Piper, was n't supposed to happen like this. No, it 's okay. It 's okay. Not him, please. Leo? Leo, come on. I do n't understand. How did this happen? The potion is real, Leo. It kills Avatars. The Collective weakens with every last breath you take. We told you, the truth must come to them in their own time, not yours. But, Piper, she... Understood, yes, but the others were not able to, and so we became the enemy out of fear and ignorance. And an innocent was lost because of it. Everything was lost. I was just trying to make things right with Piper. Of course. But you 've learned, and now you can save yourself. You have it in you to rewind time to just before you told Piper the truth, if you hurry. If we all hurry. It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's happened has taken a great toll on our power. As it is, we may not have enough to implement our plan. To rid the world of demons, to end the duality requires all that we had. But if the sisters come to the truth, wo n't their powers add to the collective? Yes, but it may not be enough. You must not try this ever again, Leo. You can never tell Piper about us, not until she 's truly ready. Leo, please, this is not the time or place, okay? I do n't want to get into this right now. This is a little dicey. Okay. Thank you. You 're distracted. Please, do n't tell me how to demon hunt. I 'm not. I did n't mean to. Let 's just focus on getting the demons. Not too much beetletoe. You do n't want to blow up the place, do you? No. Why are you being so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I guess I just realized I ca n't force things on you. If you 're gon na trust me, you 're gon na come to it in your own time. Hmm. There may be hope for you yet. Bottle up the potions. I think I know where the demons are gon na attack next. Now! That was easy. Wait. All right. Now all we have to do is get rid of the other gang and we can bring the innocent back. All right, I give up. How did you figure all this out? You do n't want to know, believe me. What? Nothing. Just, uh, glad you gave me another shot, that 's all. You did n't think I would? Well, I did n't hear from you after I botched breakfast. Well, breakfast is n't really a date anyway, right? And dinner, much better. And dessert? Dessert, too. Dessert is good. You know, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any other secrets I should know about you? Other than my crazed obsession with Avatars... Oh, you 're not so crazed. No? Wait till I meet one. Forget that. Let 's, uh, rewind, and you can ask me the secrets question again, okay? Do you, Kyle Brody, have any secrets? No. They asleep? Yeah. Finally. Piper? Look, I know you think there 's something I have n't been telling you. Leo, not now. Just hear me out. There actually is something I 'm not telling you, but not because I do n't want to. It 's because I ca n't. What do you mean you ca n't? The Elders wo n't let you? Well, I ca n't even tell you that. I can tell you you 're gon na find out soon. You 're gon na be okay with it. Oh, yeah? How do you know? I know you.
