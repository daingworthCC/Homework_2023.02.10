Law Order CI 3x06 Stray ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC : 2003/11/02 My detectives, Gilman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undercover, doing a gun buy from the two punks. Where were their backups? They had to back off. They thought they were being made. By the time they caught up, this is what they found. But they had on a wire. They could hear what was going on in the car. The wire cut out. The equipment... The reception 's for crap out here. We 're sorry about your guys. How much was the buy money? Thirty-five hundred in marked bills. For five plastic guns. Yeah. We got set up. They had one or more accomplices waiting here to ambush us. They took the dough and scrammed, probably through those woods. We 're checking the bridges and ferries. We 'll need to talk to the backups. They 're pretty shook-up. Well, we 'll make it quick. Paint job, the attention to detail. Got a real weight to it. These are L.E.D. Light bolts. They use ' em on custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Detective... Price? - Yes / - Williams. I 'm Robert Goren. This is Detective Bishop. We 're sorry about your partners. - We just have a couple of questions... - We heard that they had a family, kids? Yeah. Gilman had a boy, and Lewis had two girls. Okay. We 'll keep that in mind. How 'd you hook up with the punks? Gilman put the word out he was in the market for firepower. Those two punks come up to him, sold him a.38 SW. They said they had five more pieces to sell. They wanted six grand. Gilman said he needed a day to get the money up. The punks said, " No, the deal has to go down right now. " So they came back with 3,500, bottom price. We jumped on it. We did n't even know who these guys were. - All we had were their street names. - Looks like Lewis was shot first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiating the deal. Single bullet, point blank to the back of the head. The shot came from outside. - Could I get a close-up of, uh, his hands? - Why? What do you see? I do n't know. Just some interesting ulcerations on his knuckles and finger webs. - He carries a backup piece? - Yeah, a.22 caliber. - Well, someone kept a souvenir. - Over here. We have a single set of tracks leading into the woods. There 's another road about a half mile through there. Oh, toe, knee prints. This is where he was waiting. There 's no pacing, no cigarette butts. He was concentrated on this. He drew it with his finger over and over again. They found a witness who was on a secondary road last night. Said he saw a male black come out of the woods with a bicycle. Now we know how he made his getaway. Well, can we go? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Underbrush. Even with a flashlight, how did this guy find his way back to the other road? After you, Detective. We got a pop on the prints of one of the dead perps, Darren Exree. Lived with his uncle. Uncle does n't know anything about it. We 're still trying to chase down Darren 's friends, but no one 's admitting to knowing him. Nobody wants to get too close to a cop killing. Ballistics confirmed the same gun killed Detective Lewis and the kid sitting behind him. A nine mil. Latent checked the casings. No prints. Thanks. Do you mind leaving it on my desk? - She does n't wan na get left in his dust. - I like her hustle. - You 're supposed to be on leave. - With two dead cops? This is the rest stop. This is where the suspect was seen coming out of the woods with his bicycle. According to the tracks that he left, he got from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, no path. But he found his way through the woods, underbrush, gullies, all in the dark. Just the stars to guide him. He, uh, drew it in the ground while waiting for the ambush. It 's a... a memory guide, uh, to orient himself in, uh... in-in three dimensions. It 's interesting how his mind works. We 'll give him a merit badge when we find him. Anything on surveillance tape? It was mostly inaudible. The sound kept dropping off. There was one thing. Yo. Who 's that? You got somebody on us? What are you talking about? You need to chill out. I just do n't like cars riding on my ass. - The cough. - The dead perp we have n't identified. This might explain the cough. It 's the labs on his hands. " Hexamethylene diisocyanates, acetate, chromium traces throughout the body, with higher concentrations in the lungs. " These are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands are chrome holes. Then the kid worked in a custom auto shop. How many of those can there be in Staten Island? I told you I 'd get you out. Took you long enough, baby. They were about to send me upstate. I got something for you. Check this. This you 'll like even better. No, no. Not here, all right? I got ta show you how to use it, then we 're ready. You always think of everything, baby. Well, just you. I just think of you. DIXON 'S CUSTOM AUTO STATEN ISLAND, NEW YORK THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 4 Yeah. That 's Levon. Levon Marcus. He started working for me last December. I did n't see this coming at all. - How about his friends? Do you know this guy? / - No. - We 'll need a home address. - He moved last month. I was supposed to redo his paperwork. We got busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Then we 'll take the old address. I think I threw it away. You know, when Levon used your paint booth, he... he always wore this gear? Oh, all my people do. I do n't like paying fines. Because he had a really bad cough. I 'm sure you noticed it. I mean, the autopsy found... What was it that was in his lungs? Diisocyanates, acetate and chromium in high concentrations. And he was only here for six months. He was always wearing his gear. So how 'd he get so messed up? I mean, it was like he was breathing fumes day and night. I do n't know. I 'm no doctor. What 's that up there? A sleeping bag? He said he needed the extra money, and I needed a security guard. If Levon slept here, who slept there? I do n't know. I told Levon he could n't have anybody up here. This must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his hands? - No, he 's got 10 thumbs. So the houseguest did the guns. He used this to shape a piece of metal. Make a tool. Put a lot of work into it. He did n't use it in the ambush. Maybe the killings were the first step. He 's got something else in the works. There were prints from a dozen individuals in the attic, none of which popped, and no usable prints on the spray can or the tape. That 's not good enough. This cop killer did not just fall from the sky. Somebody knows him. What do you got for me? I 'm not sure. The lab made it up using the form that was nailed to the attic floor. Our missing man, he made one just like it. Do n't spend all day on it. I 'm pretty sure that this is a handle. The rest of it... a burglary tool. Some kind of Slim Jim for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a window frame. Pop open a latch. But you 'd have to snake that end between the window and the frame... before you could slide it up. It 'd never go in. You 're right. The window would have to be open... for this to be set into place. A man rigging it on the inside for someone on the outside to use later. You 'd need two people. But if the killer had an accomplice, why not use him on the ambush? Maybe he was n't available. The punks insisted on bottom price. Thirty-five hundred bucks. You know, I have an idea where we can find those marked bills. NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 'S OFFICE QUEENS, NEW YORK TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 9 I 'm not surprised you found marked bills coming out of our office, with all the bail and fines we collect from drug cases. Happy hunting. If I 'm not scrolling fast enough, be my guest. / I 'm sorry. I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind. Eames likes to drive, so she drives. - You wan na scroll, scroll. - Thank you, no. Here 's one. A $3,500 fine for shoplifting from a pharmacy in Queens. " Tamara Bates, 19. Spent four days in Rikers. " The fine was paid the day after the killings. The gun from the ankle holster, it was a.22. A lady 's gun. Nice coming-home present. Home being her grandmother 's in Brooklyn. I did n't even know Tamara was arrested. - I have n't seen her since Sunday. - You were n't worried? I work nights over at St. Mary 's. She 's always gone by the time I get home. Do you know Tamara 's boyfriend? Who says she has a boyfriend? Uh, this does. If Tamara 's in trouble, you tell me now. It 's possible she 's gotten involved with a very dangerous man. It 's important we find her before she gets hurt. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... What about them? They beat her. She keeps going back, just like her mother. Fingertip moistener. She bought it last week. Do you have any idea why she uses this? She counts money at a check cashing store on Myrtle. She tries to be good. She gives me $50 a week for rent and groceries. SMOKEY 'S CHECK CASHING BROOKLYN, NEW YORK TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 9 I fired her three months ago. She kept running up my phone bill, calling an old boyfriend in Pennsylvania. - What about a current boyfriend? - What am I, PageSix? - We 'll take the Pennsylvania number. - I 'll check my records. So she 's still paying her rent. She 's still using fingertip moistener. She 's still counting money for a living, but not anyplace that she wants her grandmother to know. - A bookie. - Or worse. You 're late. A fire on the subway. Where you been? I paged you all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What? You want a note from the clinic? I have to use the washroom. This was a bank for one of our local drug entrepreneurs. Typically, there 's 300 or 400K. What 's your interest here? Did you know these victims? We might know the perps. - Twenty-two. - Yeah. It does n't match any of the weaponry in here. Do you know this girl, Tamara Bates? She 's a counter. It does n't ring any bells. These places go through a lot of girls. I can see how. - How 'd the perps get in? - Do n't know, but I can tell you how they got out. The fire escape 's right out there. It 's a perfect fit. So were Bonnie and Clyde. They killed 10 people. These two are up to nine. It 's rusted shut. They had to jump. These scuff marks... Someone took a tumble. Utica Avenue. There 's a subway station a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl to show around. One of them might be limping, probably the girl. These friends of yours? - It 's their money got stolen. - I just wan na talk to you! Look, we got ta have an understanding. The people that did this, they belong to us. They 're ours. If you have any questions or information, you just call me. A subway clerk made Tamara. She was limping hard, getting help from a male, black, in his 20s. The clerk did n't see which train they took. We have her photos out to the bus stations, Amtrak, airports, car rentals. Assuming they 're smart, they 'd be laying low. They do n't have a lot of options. The boyfriend was sneaking into the grandmother 's place to sleep. He bunked in the car shop. He 's a stray. He 's homeless. We have a unit sitting on her grandmother 's place. There 's an ex-boyfriend in Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months. He did n't sound too heartbroken. Here 's another boyfriend she might reach out to... Eugene Thomas. Tamara, uh, filed an assault complaint against him last year. She dropped it the next day. Eugene works for a private ambulance company. Tamara 's ankle 's got ta be hurtin ' pretty good by now. They would n't risk a hospital. When 's the last time you saw Tamara? Geez, you guys. About six months ago, at a club. I bought her a drink. I went on my merry way. Oh, so the two of you are on merry terms? Bygones are bygones. Your dispatcher said that you were... Do... Do you wan na meet her? Because I 'm sure... she 'd love to meet someone in the medical profession. - Wh-What are you goin ' in my bag for? - Because I can. You 're low on ACE bandages. Only one vial of solumedrol? One of fentanyl, one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Who 's that guy she 's with? That 's Manny Oliverez. He 's an interested party. But he keeps looking at me. What 's his problem? Well, his problem is that he 's a drug dealer, he 's short 400,000. Tamara stole it from him. What 's that got to do with me? Well, someone told him that you were her friend... and that you might know where she is. Where the hell did he hear that from? You know, uh, you can tell us what you know now, or y-you can deal with him later. Okay, look... But I can not lose my job over this. Look, I was just trying to help the bitch. She called me. She said she was hurt. And where was she? At the Gateway Inn near LaGuardia. Look, l-I was n't gon na try to take any money. I figured she could pay me some other way. You dig? But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two grand and to keep my mouth shut. - Was she alone? - Yeah. It was just her in the room. GATEWAY INN QUEENS, NEW YORK WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 10 The girl that was in here, was there anybody with her? No, sir. She was alone when she checked in last night. We 'll need a record of her calls. We do n't provide phones. There 's a pay phone at the corner. Thank you. We 'll need the LUDS on the pay phone. The room 's all yours. You done? He drew another one. He drew it over and over again. He drew a map of Times Square? Yeah. He 's trying to remember his way around, orient himself. It 's this area here. That 's where they 're heading. Times Square? What 's there for them? Well, for these two, uh, the whole world. Look at it. It 's all there. Right there. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cause it 's got you in it. It 's pizza. - Hi. Large Hawaiian? - Yeah. How much? - How much does it say? - It 's right there at the bottom. - You saying somethin '? - No, I was just... He does n't have his glasses. Here. Just give him this, sweetie. Baby, come on. No. That guy is nothing. You are a man, the man who 's taken me all the way to the penthouse. - No? Okay. - Keep an eye out, huh? The next one 's the Doric on 47 th. - You wan na take the car? - No. Why? It 's only a couple blocks. Well, your feet hurt. I noticed that you 're curling your toes in your shoes. Goren. We 'll be right there. Pancake house, three blocks down. What 's she doing? There. All right. Move in now. Pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please! They 're trying to kill me! Thank God you 're here. They were gon na kill me for sure. Thank you. Thank you! I was n't even there! After that shoplifting thing, Miss Hurst told me they 'd incarcerate me forever if I got in trouble again. So you were supposed to count money, but you did n't show up. What I 'm saying. And then all these people got killed. And I hear Manny 's looking for me, and I got scared. I 'm a good girl. I swear. I just got caught in a bad situation. Looks like your ankle got caught too. I tripped on the stoop outside my... That 's a great-looking bandage. Did you do that? My old boyfriend, Eugene, works on an ambulance, and he fixed it for me. He took me to a motel, he said, ' cause he did n't want nobody see him do work on the side. He told us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Okay, if Eugene Thomas is your only witness, you 're in trouble. We also have a subway attendant who saw her limp through his turnstile... the night of the murders, with a male accomplice. That was n't me! I do n't have no male accomplice! I do n't have nobody. We 're finished here. Tamara has suffered years of emotional and physical abuse. She 's in no condition to be... Is that what 's going on, Tamara? You 're being abused by this guy, and you 're afraid to talk? I 'm always hooking ' up with guys who end up beating ' on me. But I do n't got nobody now. There you have it. Do n't get your hopes up. They found the hotel room. Nothing left but the party favors. I do n't remember her. He prepaid the room for three nights. Jerome Davis. I.D. From Club 79 in Long Island City. You generally accept work I.D. ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have a driver 's license... / - And if they pay cash. Was the A.C. On or off when you came in here? It was off. Some people like a warm room. They unscrewed the fluorescent light and moved this table lamp in here. After a week of killings, nothing like soft lights and a warm bath. You know, Tamara 's shoplifting beef in... in Queens... was for extra-strength headache pills. Some people get headaches from fluorescent lights and air conditioning. She did n't seem to mind the lights in the interrogation room. They were n't her pills? Did... Did you, uh... Did you notice anything unusual about him when he checked in? He asked for directions. He asked me if I knew a martial arts store off Times Square... one with a big yellow sun on the outside. You remember that martial arts store, Happy Sun? Sure. Back in the bad old days of Times Square, every kung fu wannabe used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was right here. That 's what he was trying to remember... how to get there. But that place closed, what, 10, 12 years ago? Eleven. That 's probably how long Davis was out of town. That would explain why he 's not in the system. Well, there might be one system that he 's still in. NEW YORK COMMUNITY SCHOOL DISTRICT REGISTRATION OFFICE MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 15 Kids who transferred out of the school system. Jerome Davis.Transferred out in 1992 to Florida with his mother. Father is deceased. His records show a lot of medical absences. Maybe because of migraines. He repeated the third grade. Had disciplinary problems through grade four and five. He grew up in Sunnyside, Queens. It 's the same neighborhood as the pharmacy Tamara shoplifted from. Home turf. The one place he would n't need a map. - Hey, how long is it gon na take? - Okay, thank you. I ca n't fill this. There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your doctor in Florida. Just give it to me anyway. My head 's hurting. Sorry. I ca n't do that. But there are some over-the-counter medications... Jerome, welcome home. I did n't kill no people, and I do n't know no Tamara. You do n't know the girl that gave you 40 bucks for the pizza man? Does your head hurt, Jerome? Imitrex. That 's some pretty heavy-duty stuff. If your client is indisposed... - Nothing 's wrong with me. - Okay. Let 's talk about Happy Sun. You were asking around for it. Did n't you use to go there a lot when you were a kid? I went once with my pops. That 's a really cool place. You remember the wall with the throwing stars and the tanto knives? You wan na know what happened to it? ' Cause I found this article. You... You need your-your-your glasses? Nothin ' wrong with my eyes. I 'll check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1992... that 's after you went to Florida with your mom... and that it was on 40th, off of 7th. You know what? Let me show you on a map. It was right about here... on this map that you drew. - Do n't respond to that. - You like to draw maps. ' Cause you leave them all over the place. Like this one. About 20 feet from where these cops were killed. I got nothin ' to say to you. Jerome, you 're facing the death penalty. But if you say you did n't know that they were cops... Detective, he said he 's through. I want time with my client. Without the murder weapons or the money, the worst he 's facing is a gun charge. And I ca n't promise I can make anything at all stick against his lady friend. That might not be so bad. We cut her loose, she might lead us to where he stashed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him an opportunity to tell her. What do you think about this plan, Detective? It-It might be worth a shot. Davis 's rap sheet in Florida does n't include any violence toward women. - Not even one complaint. - Hmm. Abuse might not be what 's binding Tamara to Davis. Then what is? Love? Maybe for him. But Tamara 's an abused woman. She 's manipulative. She might be conditioned to only respect men that hit her. / Hmm. You know, when she was at that pancake house, she did n't eat anything, she did n't buy anything, she did n't leave with anything. - Where are you going? - Out for pancakes. I do n't see anything new here. Obviously, arresting Mr. Davis has n't brought you any closer to fabricating a case against my client. You 're free to bring a 210-40 motion. I plan to. This wo n't survive arraignment. Does that mean I 'm getting out? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire me. Let 's go. Here 's crossing my fingers she bought it. NEW YORK COUNTY COURTHOUSE 618 WORTH STREET MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 15 They 're not talking to each other. They 're not even blowing kisses. She might already know where he hid the money. - Then we follow her. - She wo n't go to it. She 's smart. She 'll disappear. She 'll send someone else to pick it up. - You 're overestimating this girl. - Hardly. These are the records from the pay phone at the pancake house. This line right here. Come on. Let 's go. Tamara, I messed up on your booking form. Your social security number did n't come up right. I got ta fix it before they call you in for arraignment. So if you could just write it here. I must 've inverted the numbers or something. You ever do that? Great. Well, your grandmother 's gon na be happy to see you, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you when you get home tonight. She did n't tell you? Sorry. I forgot. You guys, uh... You do n't know each other. The judge will probably drop the charges against her and send her home. Maybe she was gon na tell you later, Jerome. We were lookin'over your paperwork, and there 's a form that did n't get filled out. You need to read it, sign it. It needs to be filled out before we can transfer you to the Department of Corrections. - What is it? - It 's just a form. Read it. - Maybe my lawyer should look at it. - You 're kidding me, right? Come on. What 's the matter? You ca n't read? Come on, Jerome. Let 's go! Let 's go! Would you like one of us to read it to you? I mean, it 's like he 's a baby. Does n't know his ABC 's. Shut up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't. You can shoot two cops, but dumb as this bench! Leave him alone. He 's not dumb! He 's smart! He 's a man. Why do n't you take off his chains and see how smart you are? Oh. Oh, that 's it. You look out for him. Aw, you do n't let him feel ashamed. You do n't make fun of his problem. Your problem, Jerome. Hmm? Do you know what that problem is? Why you get headaches? Why, when you look at that form, all the letters, - they get jumbled in your head? - I 'm not dumb. Why you can look at a window frame once... and build this, have it fit perfectly? I did n't build nothin '. Draw maps from, uh... from memory? People that have your problem, they think in three dimensions. Some of them become rocket scientists. No? Yeah. Work for NASA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just dyslexic. It 's a learning disability. If you 'd been to the right school, you might 've been helped. Instead, they held you back, kids made fun of you, you got into fights. And girls... when they figured out you could n't read, they made fun of you. They laughed at you, did n't they? Made you feel like you were less of a man. But not Tamara. No, she saw your... potential, your rage. She identified your weakness, and she played you. I played him? She puffs you up, runs interference, right? Makes excuses for you, tells you what a big man you are. I 've never played anyone in my life! I 'm the one who 's always getting played! Did n't she give you what you wanted... respect? She used you to get what she wanted. The drug-money caper, whose idea was that? We do n't know anything about that. Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know those people. When you were in the hotel, and you woke up and she was n't there, what 'd you think? Did she say that she was going out for pancakes and that you should n't be troubled? Or did she wait till you were asleep and too drunk to wake up? Because when we picked her up, she was coming out of a pancake house. But she did n't eat any pancakes. What she did was, she made a phone call. That 's a lie! They are lying, baby. She called this number right here. It 's a number of an old boyfriend she 's been calling since he dumped her. Do n't listen to this bull! But this time, she asked him to pick her up. - That she had a surprise for him. - 400,000 surprises. She was skipping on you, Jerome, with the money. That 's not true. I 'm not like that. You know I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told us what she said. You know what? It does n't matter, because in five minutes, she 's gon na be leaving this building a free woman, and that 'll be the last time that you see her or the money. Never! Baby, never! These police are lying to you! Lying? Check it out. Here. Tamara will read it to you. Call it. Talk to her ex-boyfriend. Come on, Tamara, read it. Read him the number. Read me the number. Baby, do n't make me do this. Read me the damn number. You bitch! I 'm gon na kill you! I 'm gon na kill you! I perpetrated those murders for you, and you were playing me? Bitch, you ai n't never gon na be a free woman. I 'll tell you where the money is. I 'll tell you everything that bitch did! Shut your mouth! He... He made me do it! What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! You look at me! Look! They are gon na kill me for what I did for you! They are gon na kill me! Get off me! Get off me! I 'm gon na kill that bitch! I swear to God! I swear to God, I 'm gon na kill her! - How did it look on tape? - Damning. The girl pleaded to life without parole. As for Mr. Davis, the district attorney... has decided to seek the death penalty. Are you all right with that? Uh, now is the wrong time to ask. Ready? We have half an hour to get uptown. Eames is gon na meet us at the church. All right. Let 's go.
