5214441 [bell_ringing] Johnny, let 's go! I told you we have to leave by 9:00. I 'm finishing a deal. Can you give me a second? It 's a long drive. We need to go We 're not going anywhere if I do n't finish this deal. Hey. [kisses] You know I love you, right? That 's what I 'm saying. Like, why would you do it? Come on, let 's blow this town. Oh, so now you 're in a rush? You 're so rude. I just told you I love you. Come on. Hey. You know anybody who drives a black Tahoe? No. Why? What are you doing? [horn_honks] Well, you can at least warn me before you do that. Why would a government-issue SUV be following us, Vicky? - How would I know? - You 're hiding something. Is there something I need to know? - Of course not. - Ever since I met you, I feel like there 's been somebody following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business that you 're in. Uh, no. I 've been in this business a long time, and I 've never felt heat like this. Okay, can you please just slow down? - Why are they following us? - I do n't know, okay? I have n't talked to anyone. This is exactly why I asked you to stop dealing. - No. - I begged you. This is why. There is something else going on here. You know what? We 'll just drive all the way to L.A. tonight. We 'll see who runs out of gas first. Okay, we can not go to L.A. tonight. We have to be in Reno by morning. Okay, well, I 'm going to L.A. Well, I 'm not. - Oh, you 're not? - No. Okay, fine. Then you and I are done. Why do you have to be like that? Because I can not go back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huh? Who are these people? What do they want? Get out of the car now. Get out of the car. Johnny, you ca n't leave me here. Why? Because... I 'm pregnant. [scoffs] Okay, did you just hear anything that I said to you? - We 're gon na have a baby. - I do n't believe you. What you mean, you do n't believe me? Just get out of the car, please. Now, please! I thought you loved me. I do, but not enough to go back to prison. Out. Now. [sighs] Great. Where 's Victoria? Let her sleep. She 's been through enough. Oh, sweetheart! We were just about to come get you. Uh, come, sit. Have breakfast with the family. No, thank you. I 'm just gon na shower and get out of here. Victoria... Come on. Have breakfast with us. Or what? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are you staring at? I 'm not an alien. Could 've fooled me. Christian... So, how are things? I 'm pregnant. You 're what? I 'm with child. I know what pregnant means. You 're 17 years old. You 're a child. Yeah, well, I can vote in six months. Of course, I wo n't be voting for you. Why do n't you two leave the table? You 're excused. But, Dad... Go. Who 's the father? There is no father. The baby was immaculately conceived. - Pretty cool, huh? - Do n't be a smart-ass with me. - Who 's the father? - What 's the difference? The father 's not gon na be in the baby 's life, so -- The kid you were out with last night? Does it matter who the father is? Do n't tell me it does n't matter, Barbara. - It matters. - It does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Vicky is home with us, and she 's -- Shut up! I 'm talking to her! I wan na know who the father is! It 's fine. Mom, do n't you see what 's going on here? Daddy dearest is more concerned about his son-in-law being a criminal than he is concerned about her own daughter. - That 's not true, sweetie. - No, it is. It 's fine. What, Dad? Am I gon na put a dent in your run for D.C.? You are a spoiled, spoiled, impossible brat. You have no idea the sacrifice that has been made for you and for this family so that you can walk around with the [ring] in your nose and tattoos on your neck. Oh, no, Dad, I do know. Actually, that 's the thing. So much so that I do n't even know my own father. Get out! Get out of this house! Sir, your candidacy for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the media. You do n't think I know that? Let 's not discuss this in public. Close the door, please. [chuckles] Well... my daughter has suddenly become a problem. She 's pregnant. And the father 's rap sheet is a mile long. The media will be all over you if the father of your grandchild is a criminal. You can kiss your senate campaign goodbye. I wo n't let that happen. What do you propose? We ca n't force your daughter to abort her baby. I know that. I would n't do that. So you guys are sure about this? Oh, 100%. If we were n't, we would 've stopped the process a long time ago. We have filled out every piece of paper imaginable. A lot of bureaucracy and red tape to me. Oh, I do n't think so. I mean, you guys are literally acquiring another human being. I 'm glad they make you fill all of that out. Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're waiting for an independent closed adoption, That 's where the mother is willing to release the child 100%, no strings attached. That 's all nice, but did you put a limit to the age? Well, we 're hoping for a newborn. Well, yeah. You wo n't be able to sleep. We figure whatever age baby we get is gon na be a blessing. - Yeah. - Yeah. So when do you find out? - The call could come anytime. - We 're on a waiting list. Yes, it is. Honestly, I 'm surprised to see you here. I know. I... I just wanted to confirm 100% that I ca n't get pregnant. There is no such thing as 100%, Sarah. You 're certain I have PCOS. Yes, I 'm positive. Polycystic ovarian syndrome is the most common cause of infertility in women. It 's been researched backwards and forwards. Sarah, you 're doing the right thing. Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four months already. Yeah, but, you know, you 've got ta give it time. First, they have to plant the baby seeds and water them, and the baby will grow slowly out of the ground, then the stork has to pick the baby up. Very funny, Farmer John. Listen, it 'll happen. It takes time. And plus, it 's a long list. There are 6 billion people on this planet procreating. You would think that there would be homeless babies in need of love everywhere. Yeah, I mean, one 's bound to drop at any minute. Oh! Hey, what was that? I think I heard a baby hit the roof. Hey, listen. Come here. We 're gon na have this little girl for the rest of our lives. - Yeah. - Yeah. We just have to be patient. I promise you that phone is gon na [ring] any day now. [phone_ringing] See? See? [ringing_continues] Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the score of the game! I 'm recording it! Uh, it 's Jerry. We have a pool on the game at the office. All right, all right, shut up. I 'll turn it on. Bye. Oh, honey, it smells great. Thanks. [phone_ringing] [ring] [ring] [ring] Oh, stop that phone from ringing. [ring] - [ring] - Babe, it 's on your side. Who calls us at home anymore? I do n't know that number. - It 's probably a sales call. - Hello? - Yes, this is Sarah Martin. - Who is it? Really? Really? Oh, my God. Really? Today? Oh, my God. Sacramento, okay. - Yes, yes, we have a car seat. - Why do we need a car seat? Okay, right, and the paperwork. Okay. Do we need to bring anything else? No, no, no, it 's perfect. It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you then. Okay, wan na tell me what 's going on, honey? Oh, my God. The baby 's here. - She 's here. - Julie 's here now? The baby 's here. - How old is she? - One week. Your crop is ready to be picked, Farmer John. Honey, the baby 's -- We got ta go. Come on, come on! - We got ta go. Come on! - Yes, that 's what I said. Okay, get dressed. Be ready to leave in an hour. An hour. All right, uh, where are my car keys? Look, honey, it says here that fussy infants can be soothed by imitating the sounds of the womb. Good. You 'll be in charge of that. Okay. Yeah. Oh, and it also says that newborns have the desire to suckle, and that pacifiers can easily relieve them of this need. - D-Did we bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're forgetting I was a nanny in high school, and I worked at that orphanage in Thailand. - I 'm prepared. - I know, I know. It 's just the closest I 've ever come to taking care of a living, breathing organism was my pet lizard when I was a kid. And I 'm sure you did a very good job. No, no, I did n't. He kept dying every few months, but my parents did n't want to tell me, so they just replaced him. I thought I had the same lizard for five years, but in actuality, I killed about 15 of them. Sweetie, relax. We 're in this together. We 're a team. I love you. Hi. We 're the Martins. We 're here to... Pick up our daughter. Of course. Mr. and Mrs. Martin, we 've been expecting you. I 'm gon na call Melissa, and she 'll be right out. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you up. You 're a mess. I need to look good for the baby? No, for the agency. They do n't just give babies to anybody. Honey, honey, we 've already been approved. We 're gon na leave here with our little girl. Well, this is a lot easier than an epidural and heavy breathing, huh? - And no stretch marks. - Richard! Oh. Sarah, Richard, how are you? I know you must be exhausted. You 've been driving all day. Is that more paperwork? Just a little bit. I 'll tell you what. Let 's do this later. Why do n't we go meet your little girl? She 's here? She 's here. She 's beautiful. In fact, she 's perfect. - Ready? - Yes. Okay, let 's go.? I neverdreamed?? Thatonelittlelife??

Howyoumakemyheart sing? Congratulations. You 're the parents of a beautiful baby girl. - Thank you. - Thank you.? TheairthatIbreathe?? Youarethe sun? This is surreal. - You think? - Yeah. We drive five hours, and suddenly we 're a family of three. It 's incredible. You all right? Yeah, I... I just keep thinking of her mother. Well, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but... What was so terribly wrong in her mother 's life that she would give up something so perfect?? All right, guys, that was great. Seriously, really good for your first day. Now we 're going to break into groups. We 're gon na improv a little bit. And if you guys feel happy, jump up and down. If you guys wan na dance, you dance, all right? You guys can break. Thank you. Victoria. Hi. I 'm Jennifer Myers from the Omegas. Remember? We met the other day in psych class. - Oh. - So I was wondering if you would consider pledging our sorority. In fact, I 'd like to personally sponsor you. Um, can I think about it? Oh, I do n't mean to offend you. I honestly just do n't know anything about sororities. That 's totally fine. Take your time. - Thanks. - No problem. I 'll see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will. Bye. You actually fell for that? Excuse me? Uh, yeah. The whole superficial sorority stuff. You fell for that. Oh, you think it 's superficial? Yes, I know it is. Well, maybe that 's just because a fraternity has n't asked you to join them. Oh, really? And what makes you so sure they have n't? Oh, they have n't. Why? Because I 'm not a jock or something like that? Um, no, because you 're a dork. Oh. But I like dorks. - Really? - Yeah. And why is that? Because dorks are different. They 're free thinkers. They do n't follow others. They make their own path. Well, I guess I 'm a dork then. So what 's your major? Child development. Really? Very cool. Is that your group? It is now. Okay. [chatter]? Doyouknowthat I'mhere rightinfrontofyou?? Isit frighteningtosee whatyouputmethrough? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thedark butyourlightisstrong?? Andit is coldoutside tonight? So you were n't always such a good girl Oh, I was a very rebellious teenager. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - You 're surprised, huh? - Yeah, absolutely. Well, I came along way in a short amount of time. I would purposely hang out with the wrong crowd just to upset my parents. - Okay. - Yeah. What do your parents do, by the way? Uh, you sure you wan na know? That sounds like a loaded question. Well, are you sure? Yeah. Yeah, I wan na know. Lay it on me. Okay, well, my father is a US senator from California. Rogers or Worthington? Worthington. Why are you [laughing]? Because I despise that man. So do I. - Really? - Yeah. [laughs] Okay, his politics are atrocious. The way he handled the immigration bill was unacceptable, and the budget since he went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. How do you know all this stuff? I 'm a poly-sci major. - Right. - I have to know this stuff. Wow. You... I totally get you now. - You do? - Yes! I mean, if he was my father, I 'd rebel, too. - You kidding me? - Try living with him. Oh, it must 've been terrible. [laughs] Look, um... I really wan na tell you something, but you ca n't have any preconceived notions about me. And you have to promise you wo n't make any assumptions. And you have to promise you wo n't tell anyone. Yeah, sure, I... I promise. Before I came here... I got pregnant. Whew. Your dad must 've gone ballistic. He went nuclear. So what happened? Well, they holed me up for nine months until the baby was born. - He did n't make you abort. - No. My dad knew better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kinda would put him in some pretty messy legal issues. So where 's the baby now? Hey, no, no, it 's fine. You do n't have to tell me this stuff. No, I want to. Um... She was taken from me. What? What do you mean, she was taken from you? My parents convinced me that adoption was best for everyone. Why? How is that the best thing for you? I do n't know. I guess they thought I was too young. No, no. I mean, if you 're old enough to vote at 18, you should be old enough for motherhood. That 's exactly what I said. Uh... What about the paperwork? I mean, did you sign the adoption papers? Um... I do n't remember. I was so sedated from the epidural. I do n't remember signing anything. Come on, one last push. You can do it. Come on, baby. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come on, come on! - Oh, good job. - [baby_crying] Good job! Oh, my God, look at her! A beautiful baby girl! - [baby_crying] - Good job, Mom. [crying_continues] You did so good. [crying] Hi, baby. She 's beautiful. Hi. [crying] Shh... Wait. Wait, wait, wait! Where are you taking her? Oh, honey, they just need to take her and clean her and weigh her and make sure she 's healthy. Sweetheart, you need to rest now. You rest, sweetheart. It 's okay. Did you ever see her again? No. That was it. She was gone. - I 'm confused, though. - About what? The paperwork. I mean... Did you sign the paperwork? I do n't -- I do n't remember. I was so drugged that week. What, wait, wait, you were there for a week? Yeah. Most new mothers are in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were in the hospital for a week? They said I had a really difficult birth because I was so young, that I needed time to recover. Did you want to give your baby away? Hey, no, no, no, no. I 'm sorry, I 'm sorry, I 'm sorry. Look, you and I have n't been together long enough, and I should n't pry like this. No, no. I want you to know everything. [beeping] Hey, sweetheart, how you feeling? Do you think you can hold a pen? Okay. Great. The hospital needs you to sign in three places. Okay, there... there and there. Okay, that 's great. That 's all you need to do for now. I 'll be back to see you in a little while. Love you. I signed the adoption papers, but I was drugged. No, they ca n't do that. I mean, you were n't thinking clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby away? I was n't sure. I... I asked for my baby right after I gave birth, but they told me it was too late, and I believed them. Of course. Your father was running for senator. They knew if the word got out that his young daughter was having a baby out of wedlock that -- It would destroy his career. How can I be so stupid? I gave my baby away. Other people are raising my baby. You can get her back. How? I 've been apart from her for a year. She thinks those other people are her parents. It does n't matter, okay? It does n't matter who has been taking care of her. She is your child, your flesh and blood, your DNA. [line_ringing] [ring] - Hello? - Mom? IthoughtIrecognized thenumber. Honey, Vicky.

Or are you too afraid to talk to me because you gave my baby away? What are you talking about? - Andwhere'sJohnny? - Where'sJohnny? Where 's he? How 'd you get him to sign the papers? Johnny does n't care about you. He does n't care about the baby. He signed over all rights. Really? Areyousure youdidn'tofferhim - some kind of plea-bargain? - Listen to me. Legally, that child is not yours. Now I suggest that you get on with your life. You graduate from college. You 'll meet somebody. In a few years, you 'll have a family of your own. Dad, the adoption was not legal! Why do you keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we done? We did what was best for her. [line_rings] - [ring] - Come on, Vicky pick up. [ring] - Come on. - [ring] - So what happened? - They lied to me. They blatantly lied to me about the whole thing. Of course they did. Your father 's a US Senator. What do you expect? He 's not gon na let anyone get in his way. Even his daughter? No, not even you. Look, your father is a very powerful man. I 've been doing a lot of research about him, and it 's clear that he 'll run for governor after one term as senator. Look, you need to get in contact with a lawyer now. Okay? I mean, my dad 's best friend is a top family lawyer in San Francisco. - He can help you with this. - That 'll take forever. I do n't have time for lawyers. My little girl gets older and older every day. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's with those other people. So what then? I have an idea. Will you take me to the airport? Yeah, but where you going? Home. Come on. I booked a flight. So are you still mad at me? I 'm not mad at you, Mom. I 'm just... disappointed. I know you were just looking out for my best interests. [sighs] No, I was n't. You were n't? [sobbing] I 'm so sorry, baby. I 'm so sorry. I 'm so, so sorry. It 's okay, Mom. - No, it 's not. - Yeah, it 's okay. I 'm gon na fix everything, okay? And then you and dad are gon na be the best grandparents a child could ever ask for. Right? Oh. Right. Good. - Hello. - Hi. - How can I help you? - My name 's Jennifer Myers. I 'm here to interview for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. You can wait in the conference room, and someone will be out in a moment. Great. Thanks. Jennifer? Excuse me, are you Jennifer? Hi. I 'm sorry. I 'm Jennifer. Great, great. I 'm Carolyn. - Please, please have a seat. - Thank you. Jennifer, you have such an impressive resume - for such a young woman. - Thank you. So what makes you want to work at an adoption agency? Well, adoption is just the most wonderful gift a family can give to a child. To accept the child into your home and then commit to taking care of them and loving them for the rest of your life is one of the most powerful and thankless things anyone can do. Wow. Very impressive. You know, that 's exactly why I joined the adoption agency. I just ca n't wait till I get to match up a child with a new family. - I mean, what a gift to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is. Jennifer, tell me a little bit about yourself. Hey, Jennifer, how 's it going? You getting acquainted with everything okay? Yeah, yeah, I 'm doing great. Everybody 's been so nice, and I 'm learning bunches. Good. It looks to me like you 're settling in really well. Thanks. Will and I are gon na grab lunch. Can we get you something? No, that 's okay. I actually brown-bagged it today. All right. Well, you 're gon na be holding down the fort, so why do n't you let any calls that come in just go straight to the main voicemail, okay? Sure, yeah, sounds good. - Okay. We 'll see you in a bit. - Okay, bye. Thanks. Will, you ready? [footsteps] They 're perfect. - [knocking] - Honey, you in there? Uh, yeah. Hold on a minute. Okay, come in. - I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's so good to have you home. It 's good to be home. I 've missed everybody. Even Christian, that little brat. [laughing] I love you.

Please come in. Yeah. And this is Julia. Hi, Julia. She is just the sweetest little angel. We could not be more in love with her. And she 's doing so well. She 's beautiful. Are you okay? Yes, I 'm sorry. She 's just so perfect. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Adoption, it 's just so powerful. To see children brought together with families who love them unconditionally is exactly why I got into adoption. Believe me, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't our birth child, we kinda feel like it was fate that brought us together. Yeah. Well, you 're a beautiful family. - Thank you. - [phone_ringing] Oh, I 'm sorry. This has been going on all week. Will you excuse me, please? [ringing_continues] So she 's not quite walking yet. She 's scooting, and she loves to stand up, balance on the coffee table and then scoot around. Do you want to say hello? And she says " Mama " and " Daddy " and " ball. " Sarah, the contractor needs our final decision on the tile, honey. - Now? - Yeah. I 'm sorry. - Do you need me? - Yes, I do. - I 'm sorry. - It 's okay. Oh, gosh. - I hate to ask you -- - No, please. Would you mind holding her just a second? Sorry. It is so dusty up there. Hi, baby. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? I 'm gon na take you back where you belong. I love you, angel. Okay. Sorry that took so long. Hi, sweetie, hi. Did you say hello to Jennifer? Oh. Um... Well, um, can I give you a tour of the house? - Do you need to -- - No, no, no, that 's okay. I 'm sure the rest of your home is just as perfect as your family. Oh, thank you. I have good instincts, and I can tell that Rachel -- Julia - - is in good hands. Well, I better get going. I have three more families to visit. Thank you for letting me into your home. Feel free to come back anytime, okay? I will, thank you. Here, I 'll show you to the door. - Thanks very much. - Say goodbye! Bye-bye! I could n't believe it. I mean, five seconds left only, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. - [laughs] It 's crazy. - [line_ringing] - Pick up, pick up, pick up. - [phone_ringing] - Hang on. - Hey, Vicky, what 's up? - See ya later. I 'll see ya. Hey, areyoualone? Yeah, yeah, I am now. Is everything okay? Imether. You what? How? I went to her house. How did you do that? Look, I ' llexplainlater, but, Lucas, she is so beautiful. I mean, I touched her, I held her hand, Ilookedintoher eyes. Does she look like you? [laughs] Yes. Yes, she looks just like me. It was incredible. And I actually think she knew it was me. And the adoptive couple is so sweet. I thought for sure they were gon na be these dirty, creepy, scary people, but they 're not. They are the nicest couple ever. Okay, that'sgreat, but now you really need to contact my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help you get her back. - But they 're the nicest couple. - Vicky... I do n't know. Maybe... What? Maybe what? I do n't know. Maybe she 's better off with them. I mean, she 'll have a mother and a father and a beautiful home and a perfect family. Do n't say that, Vicky, please. Lucas, if I take her away from them, I 'm gon na ruin their lives. No, stop thinking about them! Thinkaboutyourselfhere! Think about Rachel. She 's your daughter, not theirs. I do n't know what to do. Look, you need to get in contact with my father 's friend, okay? He'llgetherbackforyou, Ipromise. Lucas says you specialize in family law. Is that right? That 's correct. And do you handle adoption cases? Yes. Why? What are your issues? Are you all right? No, not really. Okay. Now just take your time. Look, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It all started two years ago. I got pregnant when I was 17. Obviously, my parents were n't too happy about it. So your parents had you sign the release forms immediately after giving birth, and you had an epidural. Yes. Then we do n't have much of a problem. What, you think I can get her back? It wo n't be that easy, but I believe for certain that you can get her back. Now, thankfully, the courts do understand the need for expediency in these cases. That should work in your favor. Okay, and what about my parents? Will they get in trouble? They wo n't get in trouble criminally, but that wo n't stop the Martins from going after them civilly. Now, it 's a chance, but you 're gon na have to take it. Now, Vicky, do n't forget. Your parents are gon na gain a granddaughter out of all this. Do you want to move forward? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone too far? Me? You have got to be kidding me! We did n't think you would go through with this. And why not? She 's my daughter. Usually, mothers will do anything for their daughters. I ca n't. Why ca n't you? I just ca n't. Oh, God. Stop protecting him already. Have n't you had enough of being subservient to your husband for the last 20 years? Stop living for him and do what 's right. Mom, I am your daughter, and Rachel is your granddaughter, and she 's only been apart from us for a year. We have so many more years left with her. But if you do n't do this for me, I may never get her back. Hello, girls. What 's going on? Do the right thing, Mom. Barbara? Robert... we never should have... made Vicky signed those adoption papers when we did. You talking about the adoption? I 'm talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was born out of wedlock, and the father was a drug dealer. Please stop, Robert, please. Please stop putting a political spin on everything. It is not political, Barbara. I 'm being a practical. She made a mistake. But out of that mistake came a beautiful baby girl. And we gave her away. And it 's time for us to take responsibility for that. It 's already too late. The child has been living with another family for over a year. - It 's not too late. - Yes, it is. No, it 's not. She 's my baby, not theirs. I saw her yesterday. You saw her? How? It does n't matter how. What matters is she knew. Mom, she knew that I was her mother. - How? She 's only a year old. - I do n't know. I ca n't explain it, but she knew, and she knows I 'm coming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right and help me get her back. Dad, you became a politician so that you could help people. You 've changed, Daddy. I mean, what happened? Ca n't you see that I need you? Ca n't you see that this is an opportunity to right your wrongs, to help your daughter and help get back your granddaughter? Dad, please see this from my perspective, from our family 's perspective. Your father could lose his office. Millions of people depend on him. You 're right. I 'm sorry. I 've been selfish I 've been thinking about myself and about my reputation. I hope you can forgive me. I love you, Dad. I love you, too. I love you, too, Mom. [whispering] [phone_vibrating] Excuse me just a moment. Richard Martin. Yeah. I 'm sorry. Excuse me. Yes? No, no, no, no, this can not be happening. Richard, tell me this is n't true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please tell me this is not true. Honey, we 're gon na fight it. We 're gon na fight it with everything we got. She 's my baby, she 's my baby. They ca n't take her away from me. No one can take her away from me, Richard. No one! Why now... when everything 's perfect? Honey, listen, we are not gon na let this happen. I 've already contacted Len Shapiro. He 's the best lawyer for this kind of thing. He 's expensive, but I do n't care. I 'd rather be broke and have you and Julia, okay? How did it come to this? I mean, how, after we waited for so long to get an independent closed adoption? They ca n't. I know. They 're saying that the baby was adopted without the consent of the birth mother. How is that possible? - Julia... - I know. [baby_crying] I am going to be brutally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very difficult case. The courts could easily view the adoption as being completely illegal. The grandmother admitted under oath in her deposition that the mother signed the papers immediately following the birth of her baby, so she was still under the influence of the birthing drugs. In my opinion, you could sue the grandparents, the adoption agency, the hospital, but that still wo n't give you Julia. Someone should go to jail. Unfortunately, this is a civil matter, so no actual crime has been committed. There has to be something that we could do. Julia 's been with us for a year. We 're her parents. Unfortunately, according to the law, you 're not. It is possible that you could be considered foster parents. - Foster parents? - Yes, as you 're aware, foster parents are there to help care for the child until a permanent home can be found. But we 're her permanent home. Well, we can go around in circles with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the rights in this matter. What if we left the country? No, no, no, that would not be good. Virtually every country has extradition laws regarding children. You 'd be sent straight back to the States, and you 'd be in serious trouble. So what are you suggesting, that we just give her back? Just hand her over like a leased car? I 'm not saying that. I 'm just saying that the court gives the biological parent the benefit of the doubt in these cases. So I want to suggest that we meet with a mediator rather than go to court. A mediator? There 's nothing here to mediate. That little girl is ours. We 're dealing with a very high-powered family. I think it 's best to start this process in a more sensible environment. By meeting them in court, well, it could appear aggressive. [phone_ringing] [ring] Hello? Yes, this is Mrs. Worthington. Oh, okay. Tomorrow, 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Los Angeles for mediation. Please messenger this to the March firm. - Yes, Mr. Windsor. - Thank you. - Yes? - Yes. Mr. Klein. - Okay. There he is right there. - Thank you. [whispering] That 's the girl from the adoption agency. What 's she doing here? That 's the birth mother. No. No, she works at the adoption agency. She-- She came to our house. She met Julia. She said she worked for the agency. It 's good to see you again, Jennifer. Or is it Victoria? Mr. Klein, Victoria has already met Julia. She came over to our house. She told me that she worked for the adoption agency. She illegally came into my home. To see my child. And you would 've done the exact same thing if she was your child. - She is my child. - No. She is n't. She was illegally taken from me two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your parents! - Yes, by my parents, but what difference does it make? She 's my baby. She has my DNA. She has my face. Ladies, please calm down. Mr. Klein, may I please say something, please? Senator, with all due respect, we have n't even started the process yet. I understand that, sir, but before we do begin, I would like the Martins to know that we do understand, my wife Vicky and I, how difficult and painful this is for you. No, no, you do n't. You have no idea. Mrs. Martin, with respect, we do. We 're dealing with an incredibly unusual situation : one baby and two mothers. No! There is only one mother here! I am her mother! I 'm sorry, I-- I do n't care how powerful you are. You 're not taking my daughter. I will fight you with everything we have. Mr. Klein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up. You did. - No, I -- The adoption was completely and totally legal. There 's nothing to discuss here. I ca n't even believe we 're here. This should n't be happening! Okay, clearly this is a very emotional and heated situation. I think it 's best if we take a 24-hour cooling-off period, then bring the families in. It 'll give us the opportunity to discuss this in a more professional manner. That wo n't be a problem. - Not a problem, sir. - All right, counsel stay. The rest of you, we 'll schedule for the morning. [whispers] Maybe we should 've gone to court. No, no. We just got ta trust Len and be patient. Patient? How could I be patient when they 're trying to take my daughter away? You know, if you have another outburst like that tomorrow, the mediator could very easily decide against us. What if we 're doing the wrong thing? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't you? Yeah, yeah, I saw her. I saw her the first day she illegally came into our house. To see her daughter. Clearly, she loves her. They 're bonded by blood. Julia 's going to grow up one day, and she 's going to ask us about her birth mother. She does n't have to know she 's adopted. Does n't work that way. You know it. Children know. They pick up on everything. She 'll know when she grows up and she does n't look like us. She wo n't know, and we do n't have to tell her. And anyway, she looks like you. This is impossible. I ca n't believe this is happening. Hey, listen, Julia belongs with us. And did n't you say that Dr. Billings said that an emotional bond is stronger than a genetic bond? Right? I just do n't know anymore. Oh, honey. Everything 's gon na be fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure I understand the complexities of this case, and I appreciate your allowing me to make a judgment on this case. As you know, my decision is not final until both parties agree that it is. Now, I 've studied all the evidence in this case, and I believe that this adoption... is completely legal. Ms. Worthington, in my opinion, it does n't matter that you were under the influence of the birthing drugs when you signed the adoption papers. Now, Mr. Shapiro is giving me ample information to prove that this adoption was in the works weeks before you gave birth. It does n't matter! I 'm her mommy, and I want my baby back! Ms. Worthington, please. Sarah, please! You have to come to some conclusion, as much as you do n't like it, and recognize that her biological mother is sitting right in front of you. You ca n't deny me my baby. You have to find it in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment was made. And I-I know how you feel. I know that this is a horrendous thing to have to go through, but the fact is is that Rachel 's my baby, and nothing can change that. Ca n't you see that while you had her for a year, I was denied that very same opportunity. I know we ca n't go back in time. I know that. But we can go forward, and Rachel can be with her mommy for the rest of her life. Is n't that where she should be? But... I 'm her mommy. And you were a great mommy. I saw you with her. You love her like she 's your own flesh and blood. But she is my baby. And I 'm not saying that you ca n't see her again. I want you to be a part of her life, okay? I am not a bad person, and I 'm not mean-spirited, but I have to fight for my child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you. Please? Please, I am begging you. Please see where I 'm coming from. I mean, look at us. We 're sitting in a room full of lawyers, and we are discussing an innocent little girl. Please let her come home with me before too much time marches on. I do n't want to sit in court for the next two or three years. It 's only a disservice to Rachel. She 's the one that is truly gon na be hurt in all of this. What am I supposed to do, just... hand her to you and say goodbye? Yes. Before it 's too late. Before she 's three or four, and you have to hand her over when she knows what 's going on. The best thing you can do for Rachel is to give her back to me now. Please? Would you all give us a moment, please? I just do n't know what to say. It 's a shock. All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've never experienced this. Are you all right? I love Julia more than life itself. I do, too. But she 's -- She 's what? But she 's right. She is? Yes, Richard. Victoria is her mother. And I 'm not. No matter what I do, I could never be her biological mother. Look at the way she 's fighting for her. - Look at how desperate she is. - So are we, but... It does n't matter. If she had passed away, if she was a drug addict, if she was unfit, if she just did n't care, of course we would keep her, but she 's standing right in front of us, pleading for her daughter, and I ca n't in good conscience keep a mother away from her biological child. No, honey, honey, listen to me. We can fight this. We can win. - Really? - Yeah. How can we win, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep a mother away from her child? She 's the mother, and if she wants her child back, then she should be with her. It 's that simple. And she 's right. What if we fight? In two or three years down the line, we lose her. That 's two or three more years we get to spend with her. It 's her baby. You 're only thinking of us. You 're not thinking of Julia. That would destroy her. What are you doing? The right thing. Sarah, no. Just take a little time to think about this. No. I made up my mind. No, Sarah. Victoria. [whimpering] She is your baby. Maybe it was my job to take care of her... for a little while. Now it 's your job to take care of her for the rest of her life. Thank you. Thank you so much for understanding, Sarah. You have to promise me you 'll let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to be. Okay. Well, let 's take it slow. Of course. What do you have in mind? Maybe you could come stay with us for a while, while you two get to know each other. I 'd like that very much. You 're a good girl. Thank you. - So why Rachel? - It 's my grandma 's name. I just love and miss her so much. I 'm sure you do. I 've been thinking, and I do n't think it 's right to change Julia 's name. I mean, not only is it a beautiful name, but it 's the name that she knows, and it 's your grandmother 's name. That 's really important to me. That is so sweet. - You do n't have to. - No, I do. You deserve it. You have taken such good care of her. I can never thank you enough. You know, it 's crazy. Even though this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a better situation... or a better person. You are amazing, sweetheart. Richard and I care about you so much. If you ever need anything, we 're here for you. Well, thank you. So are you and Richard gon na adopt again? Maybe not just yet. My doctor says that there is this experimental procedure that I might be the perfect candidate for, and it could mean that Richard and I could try again for one of our own. Wait, really? Do n't get too excited. It 's still in the trial phases, but... Well, you 're gon na try it, right? - Why not? - Well, try it soon. Julia could really use a little sister. Did n't think of that. [laughs] What are you thinking? - What am I thinking? - Yeah. I do n't know, honey. It 's just every place we go reminds me of somewhere we went with Julia, you know? - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories. - Oh, yeah. Of course they are, yeah. Does this place remind you of anything? Uh, yeah, when we picnicked up on the beach that time. - Remember? - Yeah. It 's beautiful. So... it 's a happy place. Yeah, I 'd say so. Why? Good. ' Cause I 'm about to make you even happier. Yeah, how 's that? I 'm pregnant. - Honey, you are? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah! - [laughing] - Yes!? I neverknew? Hey. Have I told you I love you today? No. Well, I love you today.? Whatbeautywas?? NowIdo? - I love you today, too. - [laughing] - Whoo! That 's awesome. -? Through the cold?? Tothesun?? Nomatterhow far?? Nomatterwhatcomes?
