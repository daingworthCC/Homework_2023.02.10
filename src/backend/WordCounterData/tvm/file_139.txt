5236241 My father was an innocent man, destroyed by powerful people. The Graysons are behind this. They 're gon na pay. I 've dedicated my life to avenging his death. Eventually, someone 's gon na find you out. And I wo n't stop until they 've all paid the price. I pronounce you man and wife. I suspect you 're about as pregnant as I am. This photo proves that you 've been targeting my family and my son for years. Good-bye, Victoria. Two minutes and then fire. I heard everything. You set me up. - Why did you tell me I was gon na be a father?! - I 'm sorry. Oh, my God. Where 's Emily? She should 've beat me to the beach ten minutes ago. Emily Thorne is still missing at sea. Former governor Grayson and his immediate family are being questioned by authorities at the Hamptons Coast Guard facility. Now few details are known at this point, but what has been confirmed is socialite Emily Thorne has disappeared during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grayson family spokesperson says all parties are cooperating fully with authorities. And so far, there is no word yet on suspects or a motive. Oh, my God. Nolan, what happened? I... I do n't know. I just found out. Oh, God. Nolan, I 'm so sorry. What can I do to help? I do n't know. Uh, I 'm gon na go find Victoria. I 'll call if I get any... any information. Uh, keep in touch? - Yeah, I will. - Okay. All right. Here 's to you, Ems, and well-laid plans. No! Ugh! I had Emily 's signal for a moment. Now it 's gone. I thought you said you could track her anywhere on the planet? The transmitter may have been broken in the fall. I have to go find her. Hold on. The currents could have taken her anywhere. Do you understand that? You saw her dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to treat her wounds, so she 'll go to the channel marker, because we left an emergency case there. I do n't understand how this could 've happened. Emily plans for every last detail. I thought we 'd prepared for all the variables, but it turns out we were lying to ourselves in order to meet that damn deadline of hers. It 's all my fault. No. It 's mine. What are you talking about? I gave her that deadline. I told her that if she did n't finish this, I would expose who she really was. What? I just wanted her to stop. It 's her. She 's got it working again. Go to Ross, tell him what happened. You wait for me there. I may need both of you. Go! I was governor of this state, so do n't tell me what ca n't be done. I want more choppers in the air, and I want them now. Okay. We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using all the resources at my disposal. You know, I do n't get it. Someone close to us shot Emily. I know exactly where you were, and Daniel. But Mom? Just let the police do their jobs. All right, sweetheart? I hate to ask, Mr. Grayson, but I need to establish your whereabouts at the time of the shooting. He was with his family. We were watching a wedding video in the main cabin. I... I 'd be much obliged if you could offer this young man a moment alone. We 're gon na find her, son. My photographer and I were covering the honeymoon for Voulez. We were in the main room with the family when the captain sounded the alarm. And who was with you at that time? I do n't know. There was so much confusion. Uh, but perhaps these might help. They 're photos of the event. Hundreds of them. Am I free to go now? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't speak of this investigation with anyone. No, no. Of course. And why were n't you listed on the official manifest, Ms. Davis? I was a late addition. Conrad. Can you tell this overblown hall monitor that I was sitting with you when Emily was shot? I can confirm her statement. But thanks for your diligence, Officer. I had hoped that lying to the authorities was not gon na be a component of this relationship. Do you mind sharing where you actually were? I did n't do this, Conrad. Honestly. I was waiting for you in our cabin. But since no one can confirm that, I did n't want to risk telling that to the police. We finally have a second chance at a life together. I do n't want anything getting in the way of that. Neither do I. We found shell casings on the deck, Mrs. Grayson. That means somebody onboard shot your daughter-in-law. And yet, I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were when all this happened. I do n't appreciate your tone, Detective. Well, I 'm sorry, Mrs. Grayson. But when a witness refuses to cooperate, my antenna goes up. I am not the shooter. - Let 's leave it at that and move on. - All right. Let 's discuss the public feuds you 've had with the victim. Not without my lawyer. We need to get you to a hospital. Do n't take me back. Let 's just go. Like we wanted to. If I do n't get you help, you 're going to die. Do you understand? I just want... I wan na be with you. Okay. Okay. Emily. Em. Emily, you stay with me. Emily? Hmm? Oh, God. Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! Everything fell apart. Aiden said that Victoria even knew about the fake pregnancy. So Victoria shot her? She could n't have. He drugged her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this? We 're gon na find out. Emily 's alive. She 's at Suffolk Memorial. I found her on a boat. She was in shock. So I did n't have much time, but I made sure that the captain discovered her. You did n't bring her in? I could n't take the risk. Our connection would 've been revealed, and Emily would 've been exposed. You ca n't toy with her life like that. Your plan is over. Let it go! Who the hell are you to lecture me?! You were the one who drove her to this. So why do n't we focus on how we can help her? Because if she survives, she is still in danger, maybe now so more than ever. He 's right. Once the Graysons find out she 's alive, they 'll... They 'll panic. They 'll spin some cover story to protect themselves. Or they 'll finish the job. Not on my watch. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na get past the Graysons? They 'll turn that hospital into a fortress. Then it 's a good thing that I paid for half of it. You wan na help Emily? Go talk to that girlfriend of yours. She was there. Find out what happened. Mom? I 've been trying to get to you for over an hour. - What the hell is going on here? - Oh, my God. I 've become an official person of interest. And judging by the look on my attorney 's face, I have every reason to be concerned. Is there... something you wan na tell me? If there is, you know, I can handle it. No, I did n't do it, Patrick. But after learning the truth about Emily, oh, I wanted to. What truth? She has been targeting my family for years. She even faked her pregnancy to trap Daniel into marriage. I confronted her. She admitted it. But you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she were taunting me. Why would she come after you like that? I have no idea. It 's like an obsession. I should n't have left you last night. Do not punish yourself. You 're the only person I can truly trust. And I need you now more than ever. Well, then come here. Sit down, please. We 're gon na prove that you 're innocent. I do n't know how. I 'm in terrible trouble. I was with Emily just before she was shot. And then what happened? I do n't know. I, uh... I... blacked out. And then I woke up in the stateroom. I have no idea how I got there. You got ta tell the police that. A story that sounds like delusional ravings of a woman who 's trying to prove she 's innocent? No, Patrick. My only hope is that this never surfaces. Daniel, I need you to focus. Sorry. We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her problems with Emily? What has that got to do with anything? Well, I think it 's safe to say they do n't... get along. My mother did n't shoot her. Lydia Davis claims Victoria was upset with Emily right before the attack. Something about a photograph? Lydia Davis is one step above a call girl. Her word means nothing. Well, if I only took the word of respectable people, I 'd never solve a case. Detective, you have a second? Thanks. They found your wife. - Is she, uh... - Yes. She 's alive. Emily 's a very lucky woman. She suffered massive blood loss from the gunshots to the abdomen, and she sustained a cranial injury from the impact of the water. There 's been some bleeding on the parietal lobe, which we 'll monitor, but she 'll pull through. What about the baby? I think it would be best if I talk with Mr. Grayson alone. Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid the police have insisted that you not be allowed access to the patient. Daniel, we 'll be at the house if you need us. Daniel, I 'm afraid I have troubling news. Blood tests show your wife was... never pregnant. Um... I 'd like to keep this private. Okay? Mr. Ross, you may as well turn around right now. This is a family matter. Emily is my family, and I 'm gon na make damn sure that yours does n't harm her. How dare you speak to me that way, after what you 've been up to. What has Daniel ever done to you? Do you get off causing innocent people pain? I will let you know if I meet anyone innocent. So in the meantime, I 'm gon na go see Emily. You have no legal right. Without a family representative, you may not go beyond those doors, no matter how many wings you 've named after yourself. Well, let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that. Look, Nolan, it 's best if you just go. I thought that we said that we were n't gon na let the women in our lives get in the way of what we have? So just help me. Please. You did n't go to the city last night. You were with him. I told you these people could n't be trusted. How could you?! Oh, how could you? Mom. Get out of here. Go. Where... Where am I? You 're in the hospital. Why? What happened? You do n't know? What do you remember? Nothing. I do n't remember... anything. Mm. Please, tell me... Who am I? - I should 've come with you. - Yeah, believe me, there was no getting past either of them. I had no choice but to pull the ejector seat. Now we have no way in. Do really think that I did n't have a backup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I left a smart-phone behind to create a makeshift hot spot. Now I have access to the patient files. Well done. Where 's Emily 's? She 's stabilized, but those bullets really did some internal damage. Oh, no. " Transient global amnesia "? Aiden, that 's major cerebral trauma. She 's surrounded by the enemy. She 's faking her condition to buy herself time. Yeah, it does sound like my Ems. She just gave us the opportunity to move her out of there. To where? I know a safe house where she can get medical attention away from the Graysons. Now can you access the other hospital computer systems? You give me enough time, and I will make the toilets flush in morse code. - Margaux. - Hey. Oh, am I glad to see you. I got your messages. You okay? Uh, yeah. I 'm fine. I am so sorry about Emily. What happened out there? I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main room. And all the Graysons claim to have been there, too. Someone 's lying. Are these... Are these copies of the pictures you gave to the police? No, I hid these from them. They 're the ones taken at the time Emily was shot. After what you told me about Conrad, I could n't risk it. It 's a good move. Well, if Conrad is guilty, he 's done an excellent job of hiding it. Look. He 's in photo after photo at the time of the shooting. This means he had someone else pull the trigger. Or maybe he did n't do it. The press think it 's Victoria. She truly hates Emily. And she 's not in any of those photographs. She 's not the only one missing from these pictures. You 've spent more time out in this hall than in there with her. Well, she needs her rest. Even if she were awake, I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Daniel. None of this is your fault. I checked on Sara. - Wh -- - She 's okay. And do n't worry. Emily will get better. She will pull through. I know the police talked to you about Mom. They asked me, too. Well, she... She 's innocent, Charlotte. I do n't think she is. No one does. I never knew how uncomfortable this chair was. When I showed you that picture, Victoria, I simply wanted you to know the truth about Emily. I never expected for you to shoot her. You 're out of your depth, Lydia. You always have been. Cross me again, and watch what happens to you. Ooh. Your confidence is woefully misplaced, Victoria. You lack an alibi to substantiate your claims. And hiding from your lawyer instead of offering anything plausible reeks of guilt. Hmm. I 'm really enjoy remodeling Grayson Manor. I always thought this room could use a splash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Get out of my house! Well... You 're certainly behaving like someone incapable of murder. But I do look forward to your performance on the stand, my dear. I 've always enjoyed a good farce. Ross, I 'm here. I 'm going in. I just finished looping the security cameras. You can now move through the hospital undetected. There 's one more thing I need you to bring with you to the safe house. Engagement ring, perhaps? Yeah, few steps ahead of you, Mathis. Figured you wan na put that little trinket back on her finger. I 'll stand by until you are in position on Emily 's floor. We need to talk. Actually, I do n't think we do. See, I needed your help today. But instead, you decided to check back into the Bates Motel. And you know what, Patrick? Frankly, I 'm not into mama 's boys. Well, let 's continue to talk about you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just to get what you wanted. You 're no different than Emily. So now you 're going to attack a woman that is fighting for her life in a hospital bed? - That 's classy. - Oh, please! Let 's stop, all right? She 's not as innocent as you make her out to be, Nolan! And quite frankly, neither are you. You know what, man? I should 've bailed the minute I found out you bribed my ex-wife to get dirt on me. Well, do n't let me stop you now. All right, Mathis. Let 's do this. I 'm in. Shh. Shh. There 's an ambulance waiting for us downstairs. I 've arranged for medical attention to meet us at the safe house. Please do n't hurt me. Who are you? Emily? Emily? Em, what are you doing? Help me! Somebody! There was a man. He wanted to take me out of here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's okay. It was just a nightmare. - No. - You 're all right. You 're okay. What 's... What 's wrong? We tried to get Emily out. It, uh... It did n't go well. She did n't recognize me. All I saw in her eyes was fear. It 's bad. There 's... brain swelling. It 's neurological damage, but... I did some research, and her diagnosis is as psychological as it is physiological. So what are you saying? That it 's not just from her injuries? Her mind shut down. It 's a defense to deal with the trauma. Emily needs someone to just make an emotional connection with her, so she feels safe to be, well, Ems again. Ross, I was... I was with her. That does n't work. Yeah, well, you went in guns hot. Emily was n't exactly primed to find her happy place. Getting past the Graysons wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go talk to Charlotte. No. I did this to her. I pushed Emily, and now she 's... She 's like this. Seeing me may only make things worse. This is evidence that Margaux found. I thought you should have a copy. Take care of her. Just let him go. What is the matter with you two?! Emily needs us! Look, for all we know, someone is biding their time, waiting to finish the job! - You 're right. - What is our next move? There 's some things I need to do alone. Mom. Daniel. Oh, I 'm so grateful you 're here. You understand that these accusations against me are untrue? They say you 're gon na be arrested. Well, I 'll endure. But I promise you, nothing is as it seems. I know. I know everything. You 've been right about Emily from the start. I did it. I shot her. You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call about Sara. She tried to kill herself. I could n't breathe. I went outside. That 's when I heard you both. I did n't go up there to hurt her. I was just so angry. Daniel, where did the gun come from? I do n't remember. I was drunk. The gun was there. I picked it up, and... And it... Now they 're blaming you. And I know we 've had our problems, but I am not gon na let you go down for my crime. Daniel, you have to understand that Emily set you up. For all we know, she put the gun there. She is a monster. I will not allow you to sacrifice yourself - for her cruelty. - No, Mom. - Daniel, please. - No. No. My life is n't your problem to fix. Now I 'm getting a lawyer. And tomorrow, I 'm turning myself in, and this will all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see you. Coming here in the middle of this media firestorm may not be the smartest thing to do, but... I need an ally. And I could n't help but notice that you 've yet to take a public stance on my guilt. I like to know all the details of a story before I tell it. Jack told you what Conrad did to his family? Yes. - How did you know? - I did n't. But Jack is a man of principle, and I would think that he would want you to know the truth, given your long-standing history with my family. I was shocked to hear what Conrad is capable of. I think he 's trying to frame me. You want more than an ally, Victoria. You want an objective party to help prove your innocence. And expose Conrad 's guilt. You were there, Margaux, and yet, you do n't seem to buy the police 's theory. Is there something you 're not sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shot. Each guest claims to have been in the main room. Lydia. She 's not here. Which means she lied to the police. You look so beautiful. It was a like a real-live fairy tale. You 've got ta remember something. I do n't. I know you will. You 're my inspiration, Emily. I 've always relied on your strength to get me through tough times. I just wish I knew where you got it from. My father. You remember him? Yes. That 's good, Emily. What 's his name? Tell me. David. His name is David Clarke. These were taken in the yacht 's main cabin moments after the shooting. Lydia 's nowhere to be seen, which contradicts her official statement. If you 're trying to frame her, I assure you, your plan is as foolhardy as it is desperate. Oh, I wo n't be framing Lydia. You will. Well, now you can add " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that? To protect Daniel. He shot Emily. That 's absurd. Why would he? Because she is a sick and venomous liar who toyed with his emotions. She broke him, Conrad. And when he finally learned the truth about her, he lashed out. My God. You 're serious. As serious as Daniel 's desire to protect me. He will confess unless we act. And we can not let him throw his life away for that vicious woman. Ah. Which leaves us one course of action. Lydia goes. It 's a terrible feeling, betraying someone you love. I 'm so pleased that you finally get to experience the sensation yourself. Hey. I thought you 'd be getting Carl by now. So did I. But now I 'm not so sure. This thing with Emily has really... It 's really gotten to me. Yeah. Me, too. I 've been trying to help her, but the weirdest thing just happened. What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked what his name was, she said, " David Clarke. " Well, she... I mean, she probably... Saw you and then got mixed up, you know? Maybe. She seemed so sure of it. It freaked me out. Charlotte, um, I think it might help if I see Emily. Look, she 's obviously confused. I think I can help her remember that she 's Emily Thorne and not... someone else. There you are. Well... I know everything that 's happened has been a nightmare. But I feel safe knowing that we 're handling it together. What 's wrong? We 've been exposed. I have to revise my statement to the police. They 'll know I was lying. Yeah, well, Lydia, I have no choice. I mean, I 'm facing an obstruction of justice charge. Conrad, we 're talking about my life. Our life. I have n't done anything wrong. I need your help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you. Oh, come on. What do you have to be concerned about? After all, you 're... You 're innocent, right? So... All you have to do is trust me. That 's what you said to David Clarke. Oh, come on. This is an entirely different situation. Do n't you think? I 'm gon na look after you. So do n't do anything rash. And stay here, so... I know where to find you. I 'll get that for you. - Thank you. - My pleasure. It 's done. She 's gone. That 's an interesting tattoo. What does it mean? I 'm not sure. I saw you earlier. What 's your name? Excuse me. Could you give us some privacy, please? Sure. Emily, meet Jack. A statewide search is on for Lydia Davis, now the prime suspect in the brutal shooting of Emily Grayson. Police report the socialite was last seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you have any idea what you 've cost me? Daniel, I just allowed myself to believe that life could be something other than gray and cold. And I was forced to sacrifice all of it to protect you. Well, I did n't ask you to. I was handling it myself. You were? What, by admitting that you shot your wife? How very noble for you. It 's more than you would 've ever done. Have you lost your damn mind? I just offered you freedom at my expense, and you meet it with reprobation? Okay. All right, fine. But if that 's the case, the next time you find yourself in need of salvation, may I suggest that you drop to your knees and you pray? Because from here on, your only hope will be divine intervention from the heavenly father himself because your earthly father is finished with you! You do n't think I 've sacrificed?! All I have ever done is sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who meant anything to me, who never lied to me, who loved me. Sara? Well, there 's no accounting for taste. You say one more thing about her. I beg of you. Oh, you wan na take this out on me? You better think again, because I am this close to showing you what I 'm truly capable of. Do it, ' cause I 've got nothing left to lose. What are you doing here, Niko? Well, when I heard what happened to Emily Thorne, the news did n't mention anything about you. So I came to make sure you 're okay. Well, I had to go radio silent. You knew that. And why are you treating Emily? That 's too risky for you. I 'm the best doctor you know. I saved your life when you got shot. Did n't I? Yes. And for that, I owe you a debt. Which I plan on collecting. And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be easier to just stay close to Emily and hope you showed up. Well, you should n't have come. Well, I 'm here, so use me. Fine. You stay close to Emily. - But whatever you do... - Do n't trust the Graysons. I know. I remember. Do you remember what I told you? Yes. Nothing 's changed. You 're getting rid of it? It 's been tarnished, and thus lost its unique appeal. I 'm sorry for letting you down. I ca n't tell you how to live your life, Patrick, or who to live it with. Do what makes you happy. I know what you 're doing. Someone hurts you, and you run. That 's your M.O., right? I 'm not gon na let you push me away. No, I told you before, we 're a team. So I 'm staying right here. And together, we 're gon na take down everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nolan. He keeps this, um, box locked up behind the painting that he took from you. Uh, it 's got this design etched on the side of it. Two infinity symbols. They 're linked together. I swear I 've seen it before. Was it something like this? It was exactly like that. There 's something so familiar about you. Well, we 've known each other for a very long time. Sort of. There 's kind of a big gap there. What happened? I literally have no idea how to answer that question. I hate this. I feel so helpless. If it 's any consolation, you are the strongest person I have ever known. People keep saying things like that. I do n't feel it. Trust me. You are the toughest, most annoyingly bullheaded person on the planet. Emily, I 'll admit that there have been times I... Never wanted to see you again. But... Then you left me this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Amanda. She was wearing it when she died. And you were there. I know you do n't remember this, but we had a big fight about it. We 've... had a lot of fights this summer, actually. That 's my fault. I... I 've been holding on to all that pain and... And anger, and putting it on you. It 's not fair. I 'm so sorry. That 's what I wanted to say on the beach. Come back to us, Emily Thorne. Oh, my God. I 'm so sorry. Do n't be. Daniel. No. It 's Jack. Daniel. Daniel shot me. How did that gun get in your car? The person who killed Lou. You know who that was? Previously on " betrayal "... It 's delicious. You do n't like it. You do n't have to lie just to be nice. Is n't it crazy how women always do that? I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, too, dad. Do you remember that night when you called me asking for help to find the magic book? Lou mrozek was killed that night. Jack was standing next to me when I talked to you. I 'm here to make a confession. I killed Lou mrozek. I hear you have something to say about the mrozek murder. It was me. I killed Lou mrozek. Is that so? Start at the beginning. Lou was embezzling from karsten allied. It had been going on for a while. It was over $1 million before we figured it out. I confronted him one night. Things got heated. I did n't know he carried a gun. For protection? Well, he was paranoid, jumpy. It was stupid on my part. I should have anticipated it, but the gun surprised me. He pointed it at my chest. Without even thinking, I lunged, wrestled it from his hands, and shot him. It was n't... Rational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Karsten? Was he with you? I did n't tell t.J., but I followed him from the restaurant. Why? Well, ' cause t.J. Was emotional. Lou was under siege. I wanted to make sure things did n't escalate. But they did? But not until after t.J. Left. That 's when I approached Lou myself. And that 's when you shot him? Yes. Like I told you, it was in self-defense. So... To the best of your recollection, these are the events that took place on the night of September 27, 2013? Yes. I swear, I just wanted to talk to him. Uh-huh. And things got out of hand. Yeah. I guess you could say things got out of hand. - - Captions by vitac - -
