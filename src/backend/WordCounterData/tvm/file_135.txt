He 's just bad enough to actually hit somebody. GIRL : So, you guys, it 's totally true. I talked to Emily Paulsen, who saw it in P.E. Apparently, Sharon was just walking around flaunting it. She 's got like zero modesty. She 's got a tattoo? Yeah, it 's in the front. It 's way down low. It 's a butterfly. No way!

Mr. and Mrs. Bridges? Yes. Uh, would you come with me, please? Sure. Well, the bullet hit her here in the gluteus maximus, which is the largest muscle in the buttocks, and it stopped just short of the femur here. And it was a little tricky getting it out. Now if it had hit her here, it would 've pierced her coccyx, caused nerve damage and possible paralysis. Your daughter was lucky today. She was very lucky. Hi, baby. Hi, Mom. We 're here. Hi, Daddy.

Till I find something, or I 'm satisfied that I wo n't. I 'm absolutely mortified. I 've been here 18 years, and this has never... You read about it happening in the public schools, but it 's an anomaly here, I can assure you. Mr. Dunlap, every 90 minutes, a child dies in this country from gunshot wounds.

His, uh, classmates voted him " most likely to succeed. " However, the principal pinned him as the " biggest pain in the butt. " What about the gun? Yeah, well, they were part of a shipment that was hijacked last year on the way to some wholesalers in town. A couple of the guns have surfaced in felonies, and a couple more came up as evidence in that, uh, gang slaying in Potrero Projects last month. Did you get an address on the kid? Russian Hill.

She gets nothing out of my son going to jail. I know the best plastic surgeons in the city. Whatever it takes, just give me a number. I 'm a rich woman, Inspector. Do n't be shy. A hundred million dollars would n't even begin to cover it. Now I 'm gon na suggest you put that away before I misconstrue this as a bribe, okay? What is this, the silent treatment? Who sold you the gun, Brian? What gun? The one you shot my daughter with this morning. Should n't I have a lawyer around here somewhere? He 's coming.

He gives it to Cassidy, and suddenly, she 's feeling better now that he 's here. Yeah, yeah. And that 's the problem, huh? Oh. It used to be your job. Mm. Look, Cassidy 's getting ready to leave the nest, okay? She 's transferring her affections to somebody her own age. It 's... It 's natural.( @clicks_tongue) All right, look at it this way - - in a couple years, she 'll come around, man. She 'll be taking care of you just like you 're taking care of Nick. It 's beautiful.

Did a stretch in Soledad, and he knew his way around the Q. I do n't understand. If the guy is dead, that 's end of story, right? Nope. I found a bag of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pay stub from Gage 's Gun Shop on York Street in the Mission. Call Judge Pinter and get a search warrant, will you? I want to see what this guy Gage is all about. You got it. Some goof freshman was showing off a piece I sold him. Piece goes off, shoots some chick in the ass. Chick 's father happens to be this cop. Cop pulls my prints off the piece. Had to do something. What 'd you have to do? Give ' em Quick. I had to. Cop was out for my blood. I mean, come on. Guy 's careless, dealing out of the trunk of his car, a bunch of lowlifes - - please. Just a matter of time before he got busted anyways. " Why? " you ask. Because... I can do twice what he was doing. I can get more per piece, and, baby, I definitely got a better clientele. This all equals a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shoes? Piece of cake. So the cops grab you, you give up Quick. They grab Quick. What if he decides to talk, huh? What then? Guess I 'll just run the business for you while you 're gone. Just kidding. I 've got half a mind to let you run with it, half a mind to knock you down.( @phone_rings) Hello. Be right there. Cops are at the store. We 'll talk some more. In the meantime, you might want to polish the naive kid act. It 's beginning to tarnish.( **34;6977;TOOLONG) Who 's in charge here? That would be me. Inspector Bridges, SIU. And you are? Timothy Gage. This is my shop. Uh, Mr. Gage, we have reason to believe one of your employees has been running stolen weapons out of here. Who? The name 's Quick. Is that what he told you? BRIDGES : Unfortunately, he did n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Murdered? Now why would you think that? Was he? DOMINGUEZ : As a matter of fact, he died in a car crash running away from us. Now, why do you suppose he was running away from us? Beats me. You 're wasting your time here. Eh, what can I tell you. It comes with the job. Yeah, well... just put the place back together when you 're done. You can do that, ca n't you? You know, I do n't really like that guy. I do n't know him, but I do n't like him. Dot your " I " s and cross your " T " s, gentleman. We lock this guy up... I do n't want any hiccups. Just like old times, huh, Nash? What is? Oh, you, me, Lisa, Cassidy, back under one roof.

Nah, not really.( @door_opens) Hi, sweetheart. Where 's Freddie? He 's on his break. Union rules, you know. You 're very funny, Daddy. We do n't get many moments like this anymore, do we? No.( gentlelaugh)( sighs) Yesterday... when I heard you 'd been shot, when I saw you at the hospital... you looked so... small. So... It scared me so much. Your mom, too.
