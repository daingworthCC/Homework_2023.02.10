5231141 Ravens win! Mommy, Ravens win. Haley. That 's weird, I thought Mommy would 've beat us home by now. Hey. Nathan, hi. I 'm so sorry. You got Jamie, right? Yeah, yeah. What happened? Where are you? Oh, I got locked in the library with Lindsey and Peyton. I missed the whole game. I 'll fill you in on all the gory details as soon as I get home. I 'm on my way, okay? All right, well, I 'm just about to put Jamie to bed, and then I 'm gon na take a quick shower. Oh, and Haley, I love you. - I love you, too. - Bye. Do I really have to go to bed, Daddy? Yep. PJs, brush teeth, bed. Five minutes. - Come on, chop-chop. - Do I have to wear PJs? Ca n't I sleep in this? Okay, but just for tonight, all right? - Now, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Missed you tonight. - Oh, I missed you, too. Whoa, Carrie! Carrie, what are you doing? This is not okay. You have to get out of here. It 's okay, Nathan. I love you, too. What are you talking about? You think I love you? Carrie, you have to get out of here. Here, take this. Go. Get out of the shower. Carrie, get out of this bathroom right now. Haley, this... Oh, my God. This... This is n't this, okay? I swear to you, I did n't... Look, I have n't... Carrie, tell her. Nathan loves me and I love him back. I want you to get the hell out of my house. Right now! Haley, look, I know this must look... You get out, too. - Look, I did n't... - Get out! Oh, I 'm sorry, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait, that 's me, Peyton Sawyer, label president. Touch?. What are you doing here, John? The big corporate label finally fire you? I happened to catch this new artist 's live performance that just went completely viral online. Perhaps you know her? Mia Catalano? She 's my artist, John. It 's a pretty big office for such a small label, do n't you think? Well, I 've got a good act. And that 's one more than you 've got at your great big label. It 's good to see you, Sawyer. By the way, what are you feeling about the first single? Only Fooling Myself? John, stay away from Mia. Let me ask you something, Peyton. If a great song is recorded, but nobody gets a chance to hear it, does it really exist? Hey. Hey, Peyton, check it out. Haley made the finished version sound so much better than the demo. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fooling Myself is definitely the single. Mia, I need to ask you a question, okay? Were you approached by a record executive named John Knight? You mean that creepy old guy who said he used to be your boss? - No wonder you left LA. - No, no, this is serious. What did he say? Nothing. He said he saw my MySpace video and that he wanted to hear the whole record. Is that all he said? Mia, come on. What else did he say? He said I made a big mistake in signing with you, and you do n't have the experience to launch me. Hey, handsome. Peyton in her office? She was. Just took off. Looked like she was on a mission. She was n't armed, was she? I do n't think so, but I did n't get a chance to pat her down. Oh. Easy, tiger. Is it too early for a Brooke Davis on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. You know something, I think I missed my calling. Really? How 's that? Should have gone into the clothing design business. If you can run a multi-million-dollar company from a barstool, while sipping a. m. Cocktails, how hard can it be? Plenty hard. You have no idea. That your story? Do n't write checks you ca n't cash, buddy. I 'd be happy to whisk you up to New York anytime and show you how impressive and complicated it all really is, bartender boy, but, if I did, who would tend to the bar? Flights leave on the hour, so, I dare you. All right. You 're on, Brooke Davis. Okay. So you 've heard? Haley kicked me out. I need a place to stay. What is that? It 's Dan. He 's up for parole. Supposed to be a smiley face. - What? - Where 's Nanny Carrie? She knows how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and it 's probably gon na be a little while before she comes back. How long? I 'm not sure yet, sweetheart. Who 's gon na take me to school? I am. In fact, I got everything ready. I made your lunch and I packed your backpack. Yummy. You cut my PB and J sideways. Carrie cuts it in half. I like it cut in half. Well, it tastes the same both ways, I promise. Katie Brown 's mom cuts her sandwiches sideways and she 's always trying to kiss me. Yuck. - Daddy! - Hey. Jamie, can you go upstairs for a few minutes, sweetheart? - Why? - Hey, why do n't you go upstairs and fire up the PlayStation? Mommy 's gon na let you play for 10 minutes before you go to school. - Sweet. - Sweet. Look, I have to go to Dan 's parole hearing, but before I do, - I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for parole? He pled guilty to second-degree murder. He served good time and it 's been about five years, so, yeah. That 's not why I 'm here. All right, I 'm listening. There is absolutely nothing going on between me and Carrie. Did n't look like nothing. Haley, she 's got some kind of weird crush and she thinks the feeling 's mutual, but it 's not. There was some flirting and I let it go and I should n't have, but I swear to you, that 's all there was. - What else, Nathan? - Nothing. I just... I mean, I guess I knew that she was getting attached. I was gon na say something to you, okay? I was, but... I just need you to know that there is nothing going on between us. Damn it, Nathan. I really thought we were, like, rounding this corner of everything, you know? I do n't... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need some time to think and just be alone. Haley, please, just... Can you just... Can you just go to Dan 's hearing, and then we can find a time to deal with this later? Please? Okay. Nathan. There better not be more. I will be damned if I let you steal my artist, John. It 's not stealing if she wants it to happen. Did she say that? What did you tell her? A bunch of lies to make her feel that way? Like you did with that little actress out in LA? How 'd that go? Oh, admittedly, that could have gone better. See, I heard you convinced her to quit her hit TV show in order to tour for this record. But I guess your ghostwriter and your cool producer did n't really work out, did they? Because now, thanks to you, she does n't have a music career or a TV show. John, you forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? I watched you churn and burn all your artists in your corporate greed machine. And I will not let that happen to Mia. She deserves way better than that. Are you finished? That 's a nice speech, Peyton. The only question is, can you back it up? Huh? You got a lot of great albums on that wall. But the sad truth is, you would n't have heard of half of them without the support of a major label. I should know. I signed four of them. You know what? Mia 's gon na make it. We 'll be just fine. Are you sure? Just look at that wall again. All those artists have two things in common. Great songs and a major label. I 'll be honest, I 'd love to sign Mia. I wan na get her music out there into the world, because it is great. She deserves to be heard and you do not have the resources to do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just gon na kill her. Here. I 'm in town until tomorrow morning. Do the right thing, Sawyer. Mitchell, sub in for Q. Man, why you pulling me, Coach? Come on. Let me see your hand. All right, we 'll get a doctor to take a look at that. Grab some pine. Jamie. Jamie. Why are you sad, Nanny Carrie? Well, I 'm sad because I have to go away. But I do n't want you to go away. Why do you have to leave? I really do n't wan na leave you, it 's just... Your mommy does n't like Nanny Carrie. She wants me to leave. But I want you to stay. So do I. But your mom 's the boss and what she says goes. I wish you were my little boy. I always will. Goodbye, Jamie. Okay, you have 4,000 square feet on Central Park West. - Mmm-hmm. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good investment. And it doubles as a crash pad when I want to party in the East Village. Somebody 's here. - Rachel. - Brooke, get a shower running. Make it cold. I 'm gon na need some towels. Rachel. Rachel, can you hear me? Brooke. Shower. Now. - Okay. - Come on. Come on, Rachel. Come on. Come on, baby. Come on. Come on, baby. Baby, come on. Wake up. Rachel, wake up. Come on, come on. Wake up. Open your eyes. Open your eyes, sweetie. Come on. Come on. Wake up! Wake up, come on. Come on, wake up. - Please do n't let her die. - Come on, wake up! Come on, baby. Baby, wake up. Rachel. Rachel, open your eyes! Open your eyes! Wake up! Please, wake up! Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by " okay " you mean " she 's not gon na die, " then, yes. But, no, she 's not okay. Do I need to take her to the emergency room? Her color 's back, she 's breathing, she 's out of any immediate danger. Just let me keep an eye on her a little bit longer. We 'll see. Okay. How do you know her? She 's a friend from home. I hired her to model for the company. Have n't seen her in a while. I knew she had problems, but not like this. She started screwing up photo shoots, and Victoria insisted I let her go. I need to help her. What do I do? Start by getting rid of this. Do n't put it in the trash. Why? When she wakes up, that 's the first place she 'll look. Okay. Well, I 'm afraid it 's not good. You have a hairline fracture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Well, it means you need a cast on that wrist for the next four to six weeks. Man, I ca n't do that. I 'm gon na miss too many games, man, I 'm... You know what, this is my last season, okay? To impress the scouts if I wan na play college ball. All right? Help me out, man. You need the cast on. You do n't have a choice. I 'm sorry. Hey, baby. How was your day at school? What 's wrong, Jamie? Why did Nanny Carrie have to go away? Um... Little man, you know, with grownups sometimes they just need to move on with their own lives. And Nanny Carrie decided that it was time to move on with her life. That 's not what she said. She said you sent her away ' cause you hated her. - She did n't wan na go. - Wait, wait, wait, wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school. The man is a complete snake. I 've seen him do it a thousand times. He offers you the moon and throws you out there and the second you fall short he drops you just like that. Look, I do n't care about him. I love this record and I 'm sure we 'll be okay. No, we will. You 're right. We will be okay. We 'll be better than okay, and you know why? Because I 've got a plan. We 're gon na roll out your first single on college radio, we 'll get you out there on tour, then we 'll do guerilla marketing, like flyers and wild postings in all the mass markets. Oh, and I 've got a lot of street-team contacts out in LA that I know would love to work with you. That sounds great. No. No, it does n't, Mia. God, he 's offering you, like, a five-course meal up in first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. No, Peyton, do n't feel that way. I do n't. But it 's true, honey, okay? You made a much better record than I thought you could, and you deserve the spot on the big tour and the kind of airplay and big promotion that I just, I ca n't give it to you. No. It does n't matter. You 're the one who got me here and I wan na stay with you. - You really mean that? - Absolutely. Okay. - I need to get my stuff. - It 's in the garage. Boxes are marked " whore. " I 'll have the keys now. I 'm sorry, Haley. I never meant for it to turn out this way. Did you go by Jamie 's school today? Jamie looks at me as family. I was just saying goodbye. No. You are not family. I invited you into this home, and I trusted you with the two most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and you betrayed that trust. I know you 're upset. Just know that I never meant for Nathan to fall in love with me. Oh, honey. He 's not in love with you, I can promise you that. Did he tell you he kissed me? Hmm. He did n't tell you, did he? God, that is so Nathan. Well, he did kiss me and he watched me swim naked and he liked it. You see, he wanted me in that shower. I 'm sorry that it 's hard for you to face, but it 's the truth. I have told you once and I am not gon na tell you again. Stay the hell away from my family! I hate you! Jamie. Well, well. Am I dead? You OD'ed. You 're alive, but you 're really stupid. Rachel, what happened to you? I do n't know. Life happened, I guess. Drugs? Just made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did n't you come to me? Why did n't you let me help you? We were friends, Brooke. You fired me. Who is it? Brooke, lock the door. Do n't come out till I say. - Hey, man, come on in. - Who are you? Oh, it 's cool, Rachel said you were gon na be stopping by. Come on in, man. Come on. We 're all in the waiting room here. So, where 's Rachel? She 's... She 's right here. Let me go, man. I did n't do nothing to you. Yeah, well, my friend is falling out on your junk back there. - So, where is it? - I do n't know what you 're talking about. You ever come in here again, I will break your neck. - Do you hear me? - Yeah. Yeah. That bitch owes me a lot of money, man! Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of here. Owen, who was that? Nobody that 's coming back. So, how 'd it go with Haley? She 's gon na need more time. Well, give it to her. You owe her that. I just wish he would 've helped us more, you know? It would 've been really nice to have a father today. Someone I could actually turn to for advice. Yeah. You know, for the past four years, I 've pretended that Dan did n't exist. Then I get this letter and it hits me. That one day, we may have to face having him in our lives again. Let 's not let that be today. Hello, Son. Hello, Peyton. I was pretty sure I 'd be hearing from you. Well, I thought about what you said and I think you 're right about Mia. So the assistant to the assistant finally learns the business. Congratulations, Peyton. It 's about time. About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your best interest. That 's not what you said earlier today. You said that he was an evil snake that could n't be trusted. So, which is it, Peyton? In spite of what she said earlier, I think you should listen to her now, Mia. She 's making a lot of sense. Oh, really? She 's making sense now? Listen, you can do whatever deal you want with her. Just know that I will never play for you. Never. I 'm an artist, not a business transaction. You know, Peyton, I really thought we had something special. Thanks for selling me out. No, Mia. Mia, wait. Afternoon. When I was 17 years old, I fell in love. Her name was Karen and for a long time, she loved me back. We had a son, Lucas, but we never became the family we should have been. Instead, my brother Keith assumed that role. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here. There 's no excuse for the crime that I committed. And believe me when I tell you I spend every moment wishing I could take that fateful day back. Keith Scott is dead because of me. And that 's something I have to live with for the rest of my life. So I 'll just make one pledge here today. If at some time you decide to grant me my freedom, know that I 'll spend every living moment trying to mend the lives of the people that I hurt by my actions. Because I 've lost more than my freedom. I 've lost something far more important than that. A family. These young men stand at the dawn of their adult lives. So far, because of what I 've put them through, they 've had it pretty rough. They deserve better. They deserve a father. I hope someday you 'll give them that. Thank you, Mr. Scott. Does anyone else wish to speak at this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his son. Please, go ahead. My father abandoned my mother when she was pregnant with me. He left us to struggle on our own, even though he was a man of means. Growing up, I only had one person to look after me. Keith Scott. And this man killed him. His own brother, in cold blood at point-blank range. Next week, I 'm getting married. Keith would have been my best man. But he 's not gon na be there, just like he was n't there to see my state championship or see my first novel published. Dan took all that. He did it with malice and premeditation. Dan is an educated man and if he 's nothing, he 's very persuasive. Do not let him fool you. He has a very dark and ugly heart. And he should never be allowed to walk the streets a free man. So as you deliberate his fate, I ask you only one question. How can a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to see him? Never even once. Thank you. Actually, it looks here that, Nathan, you 've been to visit your father recently. Is that true? Yes. What the hell? You went to go see Dan and you did n't tell me. Why? ' Cause I was done with him and I wanted to tell him to his face. I did n't think it mattered. Well, it did matter. Just like getting up there and telling them who he really is mattered. - Do n't you get it? - Get what? If they think you still need Dan in your life, they might let him out. You know, it 's not me I 'm worried about. Or you. It 's Jamie. Dan 's gon na try to get to him. You know that. The only way to keep your family safe is if Dan stays locked up. Can I ask you something? How 'd you know who the guy was and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been there. You mean you had a problem? No. I 'm saying I 'm an addict. A junkie, Brooke. You ever wonder why you never see me take a drink behind the bar? Been sober eight years. How 'd you make it back? Had a friend. He helped me. I 'd be dead right now if it was n't for him, no question. He never gave up on me. See, Brooke, I can understand the whole cutting off Rachel on the business side, but I 'm struggling with the whole friendship side. You do n't know my mother. Victoria is relentless when she wants something, and it 's easier to just do it than to fight her. You ever wonder where you 'd be if at some critical moment when you needed it the most, your friends just were n't there for you? Can she ever be okay again? I do n't know. Maybe. You know, what Rachel needs right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that helped me. They 've got a facility here, it 's the best in the city. And I can take her there for you, if you need me to. I need to do it. I have to step up for her. She needs me. In that case, I 'm gon na go. Do not give up on her, Brooke. You are better than that. Some first date, huh? Is that what this was? You know, I have to say, your life is really impressive. The real estate, the business, the money... It 's just not what really interests me. What 's under all the clothes, Brooke Davis? Did n't expect to find you here. Oh, you know... Ai n't nothing like an empty gym when you wan na be alone with your thoughts, man. - What you doing here? - The same. What 's on your mind? Oh, man, just planning my big move on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season you had. Boy, that... That must have been something special. Truth be told, I took it for granted a little bit. I mean, breaking all those records and the scouts coming to see me play, the state championship... I wish I could go back. I 'd appreciate it more. I just want it so bad, man. You know? - Is that okay to say? ' Cause I... - Sure. And you 'll get there. And when you do, just be sure to enjoy it. ' Cause it only comes once. In the blink of an eye, it can all be gone. You got ta trust me, Rachel. This is the best rehab facility in the city and I 'm gon na take care of everything. I do n't care what it costs. Please, Brooke. Please, I do n't wan na be alone again, all right? I do n't wan na go to some strange place. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Honey, we both know that 's not realistic. You have a problem and you need to go. Brooke, you 're my only friend. If you leave me this time, I wo n't make it. Please do n't give up on me. Ca n't I just stay here with you? - Hey. - Hey. Look, man, I 'm sorry about what happened today with Dan. I let you down. I could have done better, I just... He got to me. You know? And I know you 're always looking out for Jamie, just... You got ta understand, I would never let anything happen to him. Then go be his dad. Work things out with your wife. It 's really bad, man. Just talk to her, okay? And remember it might be better to save your marriage than to be right on this one. Okay? I mean, besides, since Haley 's gon na be Lindsey 's maid-of-honor, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be getting along with her. Wow. Thanks, man, I know that was supposed to be Keith. I 'm honored. Miss you. Hey, Jim Jam. Time for bed, buddy. Here we go. Want me to read you a story? How about Go, Dog. Go! You like that one, right? Where 's Daddy? Mommy and Daddy are just having a little bit of a tough time right now. He 's staying with Uncle Lucas. Is Daddy gon na be sad again? Like last time? I do n't think so. Hope not. Daddy stopped being sad when Nanny Carrie came and lived with us. He liked Nanny Carrie. I know this is probably really hard for you to understand ' cause you 're so little. Nanny Carrie was n't a very nice lady and she needed to go away. I wish Nanny Carrie was my mama. So? Do n't freak out, okay? But what if I told you that Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your record will be distributed nationally in six weeks. You will stay on Red Bedroom Records, which John will now distribute worldwide. You have final say on touring, image rights and album art, and you get to keep your publishing, which means you own all your own songs. And? And we get to stay together as a team. - You did it! - No, you did it with that performance! That was incredible. Dude, did you see his face when you freaked out on him? It was awesome. He was practically tripping over himself to give us this deal. You know, it was n't that hard a performance. I meant every word. Except the part when I called you a sell-out, not that part. Well, I think you 've got ta go home and pack your bags now, ' cause you 're opening up in Houston tomorrow. - What? - Yeah, and for someone who I think that you know. Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's amazing. Wait, what? What 's wrong? Oh, it 's just... It all happened so fast. I 'm not sure I 'm ready to say goodbye. No, you 're ready. And it 's not goodbye. This is just the beginning of your dream come true. And I want you to know, I am really, really proud to be a part of it. Now go out there and be great. Okay. I ca n't be alone again. You 're not gon na be. You 're coming home with me. Come here. I love you, Keith. I just hope I can be half as good an uncle to Jamie as you were to me. I miss you. After careful consideration, we have come to a decision. Mr. Scott... Haley, I 'm sorry, okay? I 'm sorry for the way this looks, but before you say anything, just know that it 's my fault. I should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have said something to you from the start. She said that you kissed her. Did you? Daddy 's home! Hey, buddy. What 's up? Mommy and I need to talk right now, okay? So why do n't you go out back and shoot a round? You know what? Try to make five free throws in a row and I 'll be out there in a sec, okay? It 's a simple question, Nathan. Did you kiss her? No. But she kissed me. You looked me right in the eye and you said that there 's nothing else. You said, " There 's nothing more. " And I have been through a lot with you, Nathan. I 've been through better and worse, and sickness and health, but I will not do infidelity. It was n't like that, okay? I was n't into her. You call kissing Carrie and watching her swim naked not being into her? I did n't kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that? It was n't me. It was Carrie. Do n't you see? - No, it 's you. It 's always you. When are you gon na learn? When are you gon na stop making bad choices that threaten everything that we 've built? Everything I 've ever done was for this family, Haley. Well, excuse us for being such a weight around your neck. I did n't say that, okay? And you know I did n't mean that. Do n't put words in my mouth. Well, somebody needs to, because you have a really nasty habit of neglecting to mention important details. Haley, you know what? I 'm really trying hard to be honest about all this right now, but sometimes, for you, it 's just never enough, okay? And I ca n't take it anymore. Do not turn it around. Do n't you dare turn it around. You messed up, and it 's... And it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And the best part is, you screw the nanny and Jamie ends up hating me. I did not screw her! What... Where is he? - Jamie! Oh, my God. - Jamie. - Jamie! - Jamie! Oh, God! Please, please. Jamie! - He 's breathing, right? - I do n't know. Come here. Come here. Jamie. Jamie, open your eyes. Honey, wake up! Jamie, wake up! - Okay. - I 'm sorry, I 'm so sorry. I 'm so sorry. No, you stay away from us! This marriage is over! - Haley. - Oh, he 's going... I want a divorce. English - SDH
