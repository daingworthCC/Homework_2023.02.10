You 're the man. Okay. This is Colby 's therapy service. Here with my client Mikey... uh, who has just met a very lovely woman named Bijou. He 's not my usual type of guy. I 'm very pleased with the body. Um, the mind is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - I like my skinny rock-and-roll boys. Put it that way. - Okay. - I like my boys who are, you know-So maybe if you did n't feed him for a week. Maybe if I did n't feed him for a week, uh-She 's crazy. She is crazy. But I 'm kind of crazy too, so it makes for a good match. - Gorgeous guy, by the way. - You like that one? - Yes. Congratulations, young lady. - Good. Thank you. Before I met her, I 'd get up at, like, 5:00 every morning... - run two- two- like, two miles on the beach-- Okay. and then I 'd go in, you know, have some coffee... and then I 'd go out and surf for a couple hours. With Mandi, I do n't need that, uh, cardiovascular activity. I 'm just, uh, you know, using him for sex. So what you 're saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex is insane. It 's insane. - That 's great. It 's not how- how he comes across to the world. It 's - It's-It's-It 's kind of what he 's got going on kind of inside him, I guess. I 'm a butt man. And she 's got- she 's got-- Voluptuous is the word, I think. - Yeah. She 's banging. I have a nickname for his schlong. We 're pretty open, sexually. So, uh, you know, we do some role-playing. Open as in you 'd be open to me joining you? What? That? No, no. That wouldn't- That would n't be acceptable. So, do you trust him? Not more than I trust myself. But Bijou, on the other hand- she could jump in. Does he look good naked? - That would be fun. - I 'm okay with that, actually. I 'm not selfish. I share. You trust him as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I just made that up. - Oh. So - So, what 's this thing with Mikey and some guy in a bar? Mikey served this guy at a bar... whose best friend is a helicopter pilot. And he said that he was flying over New Guinea... and he spotted this, like, 7 0-year-old bearded white guy. There 's not a scratch here. Forget the lens. I want to hear about this Michael Rockefeller business. It 's just a- a theory. - Whose theory? Mikey 's? - Yeah. Mikey and I. He met this- this pilot at the bar whose friend saw... this 7 0-year-old man in custody of-Hey. He did n't say " in the custody of ' though. Oh. Whatever. With these New Guinean warriors on a riverbank. It all checks out. You should read about Michael Rockefeller on the Internet. There 's all kinds of books written on him. About time, Mikey. What up? You got it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Mystery of Michael Rockefeller. " You found it. - Taking care ofbusiness. - You stole-Dude, the card is still in here. All right. Now, here is the book... that I so thoughtfully procured with, uh, my accomplice Colby : The Mystery of Michael Rockefeller. - Procured. Good word. - Yes. Okay. There he is, Michael Rockefeller. - Can I see? - Check him out, girls. - He looks like a beatnik. - " 1961. " Twenty-three-year-old Michael Rockefeller... boat capsized off the coast of New Guinea. " - Uh, that 's right on. It 's right-- Yeah. And just to kind of throw this in there. There 's been a huge mystery, like, legend around the guy for the last 30 years. Multiple sightings in New Guinea, uh, of a white dude with a big beard. Sometimes spectacles. Yeah. It says Rockefeller family offered $1 00,000... for any- any whereabouts- any information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was- He was our age when he went missing. - Yeah. - Yeah. So he 'd be in his 60s now. Yeah. Sixty-five, 7 0. So, I think the most popularly held belief... is that he was captured by " cannibals " and eaten. No. That 's just one of the beliefs. I still think he 's alive and kicking it. They actually prefer the taste of meat... that is still on the flesh of a human that is living. Oh. I would too. They actually keep them alive. They go limb by limb. - Uh-huh? - I 've got good loin. - Be a shitty way to go. - Yeah. If you 're gon na eat something, keep it fresh. So, we gon na do this or what? Look. We 're all here. Right? We 're all having a good time. I do n't know why we have to pick up and move. Hey, you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... Hey, you know, this morning when you were surfing with Colby... I decided to check Michael Rockefeller out on the Internet. just sounds a little crazy to me. The Rockefeller family themselves have already claimed his death. Surviving 45 years out in the jungle? I - I do n't think so. They have more money than us. More manpower. More - More expertise. More knowledge. They hired the best anthropologists from the best universities in the U.S. Maybe - Maybe it 's not that implausible, you know. Maybe - Maybe he 's still alive. And even if he is, who says he wants to be found? I mean, there's- there 's people that- that live in really remote areas for years and years. Think about it. This guy was born into the lap of privilege. Maybe he did n't want to belong to it anymore. Maybe he wanted to pursue something a lot more simple... a lot more pure, a lot more precious. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still out there. Maybe it 's a mystery for a reason. Who gives a shit about Michael Rockefeller anymore? A lot of people. He was one of the biggest stories of the last century. - It 's one of the biggest stories of the last century. - He was in Life magazine. He was in Life magazine. There was three television specials. - Three television specials. - There 's, like, 1 0 books about him. - Ten books. - I think they 're making a movie in Hollywood right now. They 're making a movie about him in Hollywood right now. I guarantee you. We go there, we find him, we film him, we interview him-We can sell it to the tabloids for at least a million bucks. A million bucks? We divide it four ways? What 's that? $250,000 would be kind of cool, actually. I think our intentions are completely out of whack. I mean, what are we pursuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could buy that gold Trans Am I 've always been after. You know, the one with the- with the eagle on the hood. - I like it. - Now let 's take it for a test drive. Well, my instincts say no, but, uh-What does the crystal ball say, hmm? Let 's go to Papua New Guinea. I 'm in if you 're in. First off, we 're in the South Pacific. This is Australia. This is Fiji. And the island of New Guinea has two parts : - Papua New Guinea and Irian Jaya. - Mm-hmm. So one is independent, and one is Indonesian control. So we 're gon na sail across from Suva, Fiji... to Port Moresby, which is the port of entry. So, from there we 're gon na drive across to the border... to get to Irian Jaya. Now that we 're going on this trip together... we have to ask each other the five questions to truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to five. Five. - Three. - One. I do n't consider myself to have had parents. Do you think you 'll achieve your goals in life? If I make some. - Yes. - Definitely. - Yeah.

Have you ever had a satisfactory relationship with the opposite sex? - Not yet. - Yeah. - Do n't even try. - No. Not even close. Do you believe in God? - No. No. Yes. - Only if she 's a woman. - I believe that God is an excuse for weak people. - Okay. We 've got the mosquito repellant. Check. - The sunscreen. - Check. - First aid. - Check. - Uh, poncho we 're gon na need. - Check. - Where 's the second camera? - Here. Take this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, uh - Shit. - Oh. Here. Here.

Uh, " Criminals have been known to place children or other obstructions in the roadway... " to cause vehicles to stop. " Once stopped, armed men rob the occupants and steal the car. The risk of serious personal injury during such incidents is very high. " Why would n't we just keep driving if that happened? - What would you stop for? What do you mean? I definitely would be in agreement with Colby on this one. Yeah. Well, with that information. - In the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, he 's getting it. - How about we cross that kid when we come to it? Poor bastard. Do you see any bodies? No. - Oh, shit.

We have a plan, and we need to stick to it. - Go get some more sleep. - Ca n't do this every morning. I do n't know what you guys are here for. It was my idea. All right. just let me have a smoke. What did you just say to me? Searching for Michael Rockefeller. It was my idea. - Am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong. - Hmm? - Yeah. We 're gon na fuckin ' take this up later. What do you reckon? Do you think it 's in good shape? Ah, this one 's kind of old and brown, but... that 's like the fourth one we 've seen, and you know the natives are using this for transport. - I can make this shit in, like, 30 minutes. - Straight up? Bamboo? - Yeah. - There 's heaps up there. - What? - Let 's go. Fuck off. I 'm looking at the bamboo raft... we should be making now and floating down the river instead of walking. Mikey, we are not building a raft. Do you guys know anything about the Takreet River? - Let 's hear it, buddy. - Oh, you - I see you did your research. That 's good. You know about the crocodiles and the whirlpools... and the waterfalls that are around every corner. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they 're gon na come. That 's the best part. We are not building a raft. End of story. Let 's fucking go. You could start with the bamboo stick that 's up his ass. just be cool. Okay. Hey, guys. Um, let 's just be adults about this, you know?

She 's not my girlfriend. - It 's Mikey instigating it anyway. Fix it with Mikey. Why did you bring her? It 's like I feel I constantly have to justify myself to you... It 's like I feel I constantly have to justify myself to you... because you 're always ragging on me about smoking or drinking or... just being loose. And it 's, like, it does n't matter. It 's, like, we are the way we are. Why should we justify it? Why should I justify it? You do n't think of alcohol as a- a crutch? Um, perhaps. But why is that a bad thing? I mean, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use love as a crutch. Shopping. Fishing. Golfing. - But it 's a crutch. - And what 's wrong with that? Why is that a bad thing? We all need something to get through fuckin ' life. To stop, you know-Okay. To get our asses out of bed in the morning. Well, yours actually does n't get out ofbed in the morning. So sue me. Not everyone needs the bottle to be happy. I drink to make you guys interesting. Wow. And I 'm gon na smoke to that. - Mikey loves it. - Yeah. Loves this girl over here talkin'shit.

I do n't think you should have shared this whole thing with Colby. I think we should have just gone and done it ourselves. You know, I do n't think they wanted to catch us, to tell you the truth. I honestly- I think we did them a favor... because there would have been some ass beating... with another day of- of- of conflict. - Well, we actually solved a problem, plain and simple. Yeah. - Like, we made everyone happy. - I think so. And, I mean, personally, they can rot in hell... - and we can make millions of dollars. - Maybe. Off Michael Rockefeller. And, um, a few pilfered skulls. - With a good sale on eBay. - Yeah, that was pretty lame. Yeah. That was tight. And worst-case scenario, I mean, we got to kick it... in Irian Jaya. A guy fired an AK-47 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time. I do n't think I could, uh- I could ask for a better vacation. You know, you should put those glasses back on.

I thought it was pretty lame how you, uh, took that skull the other day. I thought it was pretty lame how you, uh, took that skull the other day. I did n't want to say it in front of the other kids, but-I do n't know who you were trying to impress, but-I can deal with your mouth, and I can deal with your aggression... but I just ca n't deal with your ignorance. Whoa, whoa, whoa. - See that? - Are you seeing that? See that? Holy shit. - What is that? - Mikey. - Get over here. I fucking told you. This is what I was telling you by that riverbank.

I ca n't deal with being followed, being watched. Are they aggressive? I do n't know, man. Stay down. I do n't know. You need to be cool. Fucking do n't come to me with that shit right now. Is there, like, a peace offering we can give them? - What are you talking about? - I do n't know. Are some of them friendly? Are some of them nasty? They ca n't all be fucking wack. We just left Colby and Mandi because they were being like this.Just stay chill. Look at them. They 're not even-There 's more. - They 're just the people that live here. It 's not a big deal. They 're armed, Mikey. They 're armed. Yeah. ' Cause they 're probably hunting for food.

Do you understand? It 's over. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should put it back. All right. That 's a- That 's an intelligent idea. - Why do n't we just go up the river-- I think it 's a smart idea. - Yeah.
