5232541 : Legend holds that buried somewhere in the Iraqi desert is a fabled book penned by ancient mystics known as the Akashic Records, believed to be a written account of all significant events throughout time. Powerful stuff. If someone were to get their hands on that, they could win the lottery. Or at least get tenure. [LAUGHING] To know the future brings, obviously, ultimate power. Which is why everyone from Herod to Hitler has been looking for the records. But to find them... To find them, one needs a map. This tablet, found in the lvory Coast last year, is believed to be the very map. Although the engravings are of a lost language so far indecipherable to even scholars like myself. But we 're close. Whoever can decipher them first will know the exact latitude and longitude - of the Akashic Records. - My God, that 's it. - Uh, excuse me? - No, no. Excuse me. If you 'll follow me, I 'll show you the next exhibit, which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the map, it was a transposition sequence, just like you said. And it 's all in here. The location of the Akashic Records. Now, they 're gon na come after me just like they came after you. But I 'm gon na be ready for them, Dad. - Hey. - Hey. - How 's he doing today? - The same. Thanks for always keeping his room so cheerful. I really appreciate it. Oh, do n't mention it. I mean, for all we know, he knows they 're here too. Is n't that why you keep talking to him? Eric, can I speak to you alone, please? Oh. Uh, yeah. Outside. [CLEARS_THROAT] - I 'm not moving him, Dr Stone. - Eric, it 's been six weeks. This facility is not designed for long-term maintenance. Maintenance? That 's my father you 're talking about. And he 's gon na get better. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Sorry. Eric, wait! Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. - I think Jack 's a warlock. - Who? Jack. Jack Sheridan, the Internet-auction guy - I met, remember? - Uh-huh. I went to go get coffee, he was standing in front of me, and then I went straight to the newsstand, and wham, he was right there reading a magazine. He went from one place to another in the blink of an eye. - You think he blinked. - Well, yeah. I mean, that 's what warlocks do, right? Where 's Phoebe? She 's volunteering at the convalescent hospital. Great. Wait. You have to know if there 's a warlock test. Me? Why would I know? Well, I... I mean, you are a warlock magnet. Am I never going to live Jeremy down? You know, you had that Rex-and-Hannah thing at work. Okay, you 've got them in your love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. - What 's up with the suitcase? - A little overnighter. Dan 's friend is getting married in Tahoe, and Dan invited me to come along. In-the-same-hotel in-the-same-bed sort of thing? That has yet to be decided. Oh, so then this is just tennis outfit, right? Give it. Thank you. I mean, you did test him, right? You know that he 's not a warlock? He 's not a warlock. No cats have hissed at him, he has not blinked, he has not tried to kill me or my sisters and steal our powers, which, as you know, is a key indicator. I need the Book of Shadows. Ah! [DOORBELL_RINGS] Oh, I 'll get it. - Hello, you. - Hi, um... I was wondering if maybe we could get an earlier start. You know, miss traffic, get there quicker so we could have enough time to... - Relax? - Mmm. " Relax " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ready in an hour? Yes, every chance. [CAT_GROWLS] I wonder what her problem is. I got ta go now. Bye. Prue! Did you find that warlock test yet? Nineteen warlock-specific death spells and not one test. What if it 's a conspiracy? Jack and Dan working together, sweet-talking, and the whole time, they 're figuring out how to kill us. - Okay, now you 're getting paranoid. - Well, how can we not, with warlocks and demons coming out of the woodwork all the time? - It 's a wonder we trust anybody. - We don't. - Here it is. - " To hear secret thoughts "? We can hear Jack and Dan 's thoughts just long enough to confirm or deny our suspicions. - No personal gain. - Purely for protection. [GROANS] Okay. As flame lights shadow And truth ends fear Open locked thoughts To my mind 's willing ear May the smoke from this candle Into everywhere creep Bringing innermost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wearing my lipstick. - What, I ca n't borrow your lipstick? - I did n't say that Prue, I thought it. - Whatever. Just learn to share. I heard that. - This could be very dangerous. - Stay calm. Calm down. Book of Shadows, needles and warlocks. And Eric 's in trouble. Find out who. Find out what. The hospital hottie? What? Uh, how 's Eric? Did you see him today? Uh, why is the Book of Shadows down here, girls? - Jack blinked. - And Kit hissed at Dan. Right. And we think that they may be warlocks, so we were looking for a test so that we could test them. - Hello, paranoid? - We are not. Able to find a spell in the Book of Shadows. Well, just prick him. Warlocks do n't bleed. So if there 's no blood, you got your answer. - Who knew? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her. - Should we reverse it? Not until we know if they 're really... - Are you two okay? - So how 's Eric? - Has he asked you out yet? - No, but he 's in trouble. I had a premonition today. A demon, or a warlock, maybe, with a needle thingy on his finger, and he was sticking it into Eric 's head. So I came home to see what we 're up against. You guys go deal with Jack and Dan, and I 'll look on the Internet, and I 'll tell you if I find anything. Great, we 're surrounded by warlocks. Next time, get your own damn lipstick. - I heard that. - I love you. Bite me. [KNOCKING] - Prue. - Jack, you actually wear that to work? Ooh, feisty, feisty. Well, when work puts me in front of an online server handling 5 million online auction hits a day, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emergency? - Verschwang. My what? Verschwang Publications, the German conglomerate. You handled their CEO 's bronze-miniature collection for the Internet auction, right? Be careful. She suspects. Yeah, of course. Well, I need some bronzes checked out. Who did your validation? Uh-oh. Validation? You do have people 's collections validated, do n't you? Mostly, I put people in graves, or I incinerate them. Oh, yeah. It was Walt Potock at Berkeley School of Design. He 's the best. If she finds out I 'm lying, she 's gon na die. Well, you know what, I 'm a little late. Got ta go. Good to see you again. You 're dying first. [DOORBELL_RINGS] You ready? Um, can you come in? - Uh, where 's your suitcase? - Upstairs. [CLEARS_THROAT] I see. Uh-oh. Cold feet. She 's backing out. It 's okay. Do n't push it. Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Okay, um, this is gon na hurt me a lot more than it 's gon na hurt you. Piper, we have to get to Eric. What 's the matter? He did n't bleed. He 's not bleeding. There 's no blood. There 's nothing. Uh, yeah. Of course he 's not bleeding. He 's frozen, his blood is frozen. - Yeah. Right. - Uh-huh. - Okay, go back upstairs. Go. - Yeah. Okay. Ow! - What the hell was that? - You 're bleeding. It 's... Just a little bit. Love her touch. If she does n't wan na go, it 's okay. Do n't force it. [LAUGHS] - Dan, listen. I really want to go. - But? - He 's bleeding. - He 's lucky. Hi. Listen, Dan, I have to borrow Piper for just a little while, but I 'll have her back soon, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, you hang in there. And I 'll be back in time. - Yeah, I hope so. - Later. Whew. [CAT_GROWLS] [BUZZING] Oh, that 's what 's scaring Kit. It 's... You got hornets. - It 's probably what stung me too. - Yeah, um, probably. Okay, got ta go. Um... Do n't leave without me. - Okay, got ta go, got ta go. - Uh-huh. [CAT_MEOWS] They 're called " collectors. " They 're a warlock... [CLEARS_THROAT] They 're a warlock breed that drains knowledge out of people 's brains with that weird finger I saw. The Book did n't say how to vanquish them? No, it just said, " Their hunger for knowledge is your ally. " Okay, whatever that means. Are you sure this is where he lives? That 's what the hospital record said. 5D, here it is. [GROANING] Oh, Piper! Oh, okey-dokey. Oh, my God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor. All right, let 's get him out of here. We 'll figure out what they want later. - Okay, ready? - Uh-huh. - You do a little thingy. - Okay. [POWER_WHOOSHES] [GRUNTS_AND_GROANS] Get out of here! Get him out of here! Get back. [GRUNTS] [SCREAMING] [YELLS] Oh, my God. [GRUNTING] Okay, let 's go, let 's go! They put my father in the hospital. They took his mind. - Who do you think they are? - NSA, CIA, who knows? Somebody in bulletproof vests. The question is, who are you? Friends. Yeah, right. They 're after the Akashic Records too. - What are the Akashic Records? - I knew it. Wait, what did you just say? The Akashic Records, what are they? - You tell me. - I 'll tell you. They 're a book of ancient prophecies. The future of the world, down to the smallest detail, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just a legend. How did you...? - You 're well informed. - I read a lot. How did you know that? - I 'll tell you later. So they want those records. And they want Eric because he knows how to find them, right? - Who are you people? - What if it 's not a legend? Say they 're real. What happens if the bad guys get these records? And they use the future against us? No more us, the bad guys win. - I got ta get my father out of there. - No, wait, Eric. He 's stuck in the hospital. Dr Stone 's in on it. Eric, it is not about your father anymore. It 's about you, especially if they think you know - how to find the Akashic Records. - Try and stop me. PHOEBEGRUNTS, ERICSCREAMS How? [LAUGHS] - Entertaining guest, I see. - Hi. Piper? Could you help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? It 's Eric, from the hospital. Two warlocks called collectors want what 's in his brain : the location of the Akashic Records. A lost text that predicts all future events. Collectors get it, the world 's a goner. - It 's a... - It 's a lost text that predicts all future events. The collectors get it, the world 's a goner, I know. Okay, does someone wan na tell me what 's going on here? Have to tell her now. Okay. Um, Phoebe, see, Piper and I did n't really know about the whole pricking thing to expose a warlock. So we sort of cast a little hearing- thoughts spell just to find things out. Oh, a hearing-thoughts spell. - Dan 's clean, by the way. - Glad to hear it. Jack 's not. Wait, are you guys thinking something about me right now? No. Does Eric know witches, warlocks? No, he thinks it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warlock? I heard his thoughts, and they are bad. Really bad. You know, graves, dead people, burnt bodies. - Did you prick him? - No, that 's why I need Piper. Freeze him, prick him and then vanquish him if necessary. Where did you get that? Remember the troubled priest with the warlock brothers? Well, they left this behind, and I 've sort of hung on to it, just in case we needed it for future warlock use. Wow, it 's been a while, but it seems like they 're everywhere. Okay, you two go to it. I 'll stay here. - What if the collectors show up? - Well, just get back before they do. And do n't lose that dagger. We have to go kill a warlock while she sits on some guy 's... Hey, hey, hey! You heard that? Like I need a hearing-thoughts spell to know what you 're thinking. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you gon na behave? Do I have a choice? No. - Did you find Eric? - No. Not good. He 's being protected by a time-freezing witch. And Bruce Lee 's little sister. The Akashic Records are within our reach. It 's going to be very difficult to drain his brain if they know what we 're after. Not to worry. We 'll get into his mind through his heart. Oh, very nice. [DOOR_CLICKS_OPEN] Ah, there she is, hard at work. - I 'm glad you called. Can I come in? - Sure. Stay focused. Get it over with. Freeze him. [POWER_WHOOSHES] - Huh. - The dagger, his hand, just kind of poke him. - He 's not bleeding. - He 's frozen. Oh, yeah. Okay, okay, okay. Wait a minute. Okay. - Ooh. - Hey, any survivors? [POWER_WHOOSHES] - Okay, there 's two of them. - Twin warlocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you unfreeze them. If that prick does n't bleed, - then that one 's dead too. - All right. All right, let them go. [POWER_WHOOSHES], THENJACKYELLS What? What 's the matter, she bite you? You should n't be here. Come on, man, I could n't let you take all the blame. He 's bleeding. All right, this is my sister Piper. Which one of you jerks is Jack? Uh, I 'm the jerk. This is my twin brother, Jeff. Hey. Nice to meet you. Look, sorry for the little tap dance earlier. Mmm. So, what exactly was it that you guys were trying to prove? It 's just a little something we used to do growing up. Yeah, so when one of us would take an interest in someone... Do n't get the wrong idea. So you 'd send the other one to check out the merchandise, - sort of kick the tires? - Crude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to kill me. Good point. So, uh, Jeff, what is it that you do for a living? Oh, great, this should be a conversation stopper. I own a mortuary. Actually, a whole chain of them. - Mortuaries. - Put them in graves, set them on fire. - Mm-hm. - Huh? You know, you two should be ashamed of yourselves. - Ooh. - That 's for thinking that you could get away with it. And that 's for thinking that you would n't get slapped. Piper. [LAUGHING] I approve. How did you know to be there to help me? - Uh, that 's a long story. - Wait. Shorten it. I have this gift. I sort of know when things are gon na happen, if there 's gon na be trouble. - How? - Just something I was born with. So you do n't work for some government agency? No. I 'm just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. This thing that you did, translating this ancient code or whatever why did you do it? - I did it for my father. - To finish his work? - People hurt him. And I wanted to find out who, and I wan na get even. - Even at the risk of them hurting you? - He 's my dad. I love him. And if I ca n't have him back, I want justice. - I envy you. - You 're not close to your folks? My mom is dead. - I 'm sorry. - And my dad is gone. You do n't know where he is? I 'm not really that interested. - I do n't understand that. - You do n't know my dad. Do you? Huh. No, I never got the chance to, unfortunately. Okay. I 'm a sucker for family. Follow me. - Jack 's not a warlock. - He 's a jerk. We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dad out of there and keep him someplace safe. Come on. [PHONE_RINGS] Where is everybody? - Did you bring that dagger? - Yep. - Dad! - Eric, wait! Dad, we got ta get you out of here. - Eric. - I 'm getting him out of here, Phoebe. [GROANS] - What 's going on? - Later. Get him. We got ta get out of here. Where did they go? Looking for that? He 's got the dagger. [GASPS] Piper! [GROANING] Move, and she dies. [GROANS] [POWER_WHOOSHES] [POWER_WHOOSHES] Dad? Eric. Eric, we still wan na help you. Nothing has changed. No, everything has changed. Some kind of monsters just took my dad. - They 're called warlocks. - Warlocks? What does that make the three of you? Witches. [LAUGHS] Forgive me, but what you 're saying is insane. Eric, you believe in the Akashic Records and all the power that they represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well, most people think that 's a myth. But you now know that it is n't. So is n't it possible that other things like witches and warlocks actually do exist? Maybe, but why would warlocks want my dad? They 're probably gon na offer you a trade : your dad for what 's in your head. And they can appear any time, anyplace. Which is why we need to get you back to the manor. You 'll be safer there than anywhere else. Okay, look, Eric, I am the same girl you met at the hospital a few weeks ago. The only thing that 's changed is, now you know our secret. - It 's one hell of a secret. - Yeah, and I trust you with it. So please trust me in return. Look, if we 're gon na save your father, we have to keep you safe until we figure out what we 're gon na do. You do that. I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get him, you two get home. - Do we have to protect him? - He is pissing me off. - Eric, what are you doing? - You 'll see. We should n't be out in the open like this. It 's not safe. Then go. I have something I have to do. What? What do you have to do? Get busted, Eric? That... Wow. That 's the map stone, is n't it? Yeah. My father thought it would be so wonderful translating it. A gift of knowledge to usher the world into the new millennium. Ooh. What are you doing? If the Akashic Records are everything you say they are, they 're not a gift. I mean, the warlocks should n't have that knowledge. Neither should the rest of us. With all knowledge revealed, we could have no free will. And no world as we know it. Maybe no world at all. Oh, my God! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to translate the map. The only place the longitude exists is in my head. I 'll get security. - Poor Eric. - He 'll be okay. We 'll figure this out. Yeah. In the meantime, warlocks have his father. I ca n't imagine how helpless he must feel. I can. Prue, a warlock did n't take our father. No, he left on his own. - Do you miss him? - I did n't say that. - Do you think about him? - Why? Because I 'm wondering if I 'm the only one who does. - No, you 're not. - So you miss him. I miss who he should have been, and I miss who he never was, but I do n't miss him. I do. All right, can we get to work? Okay, let 's save someone else 's father instead. All right, the only way to protect Eric is to take the information out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uh, but if we do that, Eric wo n't have anything to offer the warlocks, and they 'll be furious. And they 'll kill his dad. Well, Eric is our innocent. Our priority is him. Yeah, but they 're both innocents. Piper, I hope it does n't come to this, but we may have to make a choice. Why? I mean, there 's got ta be another way, with all the hocus-pocus we have. Still may not be enough. I mean, we 're talking about the future, everyone 's future. So we have to sacrifice Eric 's dad? For the greater good. Man, you can dress it up any way you want, it still stinks. You know what, it sucks. [SIGHS] [DOORBELL_RINGS] Oh, that 's Dan. I got ta go deal with him. You got ta figure out what we 're gon na say to Phoebe. Hey. You ready to go? Oh, man. She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wan na go, I really do. I 'm just not quite ready yet. Piper. Any word from the pizza guy? Hi, Dan. We ordered pizza. Would you like to stay for pizza? No, I wan na go. With her. But what 's the point? Okay, okay, I know what you 're thinking... Piper! - But I can be ready on time. - Okay. Well, I have to leave in an hour, I 'm gon na be late for this wedding rehearsal. So car 's gon na leave at 6. I hope to see you in it. Okay. Someday, some way, somehow, I 'm gon na make it through that damn door. Have the warlocks made contact yet? Uh, no, not yet. Where have you guys been? Well, Eric destroyed the map stone, so we 're covered there. Did you guys find anything in the Book? You tell her. I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her. Eric, why do n't you go check your messages at home. - Maybe they tried to contact you there. - Okay. What 's going on? Can we talk? You have no new messages. Wait, you 're willing to let Eric 's father die? We ca n't risk losing Eric and allow the warlocks to gain future knowledge. But not at the expense of his father. We have to save him. Phoebe, we have to save everyone 's dad. We have to protect the whole world from these warlocks. And we ca n't do it if they have the Records. So, what am I supposed to tell Eric, that we might have to sacrifice his father? I ca n't do that. I promised him that we would save him. - Phoebe. - You do n't even care. I 'm sorry. I did n't mean that. I do n't know why I even thought it. - Do you want us to tell him? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do. [PHONE_RINGS] - Hello? - Eric. I assume you know who this is. - Where 's my father? - Oh, you do know. Good. Say hello to Eric, Ben. - Eric? Son? - Dad? I feel so odd. Dad! Dad! Oh, he 's gone, Eric. But I can bring him back and give him to you. All I want in exchange is what 's in your head. - Where can I find you? - The oak grove, the west end of Golden Gate Park. Half an hour. Alone. Without the witches. Eric? - Any messages? - Uh, no, not yet. Eric... Before you say another word, I just wan na say thank you for everything you 've done for my father. I mean, everything you 're trying to do. You sure you 're not an angel? [LAUGHS] No, I 'm no angel. I could probably introduce you to one, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of your life. He would be so proud of you. Uh, Eric, I need to talk to you about you and your dad. Okay. Maybe we should have another cup of tea first. - Okay, I 'll go get it. - Thanks. Eric, where are you going? Uh, I 'm just gon na go out, get some air. The oak grove, Golden Gate Park. Phoebe! Yeah? - Where is he going? - He was thinking Golden Gate Park. Oh, my God, the warlocks must have contacted him. All right, there are oak trees everywhere. - What if we 're too late? - Phoebe, stop thinking that. Would you get out of my head, please? The Book of Shadows said that their hunger is our ally. So there must be a way to use the knowledge that they 've acquired against them. Or use their greed to trap them. Yeah, well, if all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them long enough to get Eric away. And save his father, right? Look, it just seems to me we should do everything we possibly can to reunite Eric and his father. I mean, imagine, a dad who actually wants to be with his child. Pheebs, we 'll do our best. Okay. Then we should split up. The first one that sees him hollers. BIRDCAWS, THENPRUESCREAMS - Dad! WARLOCK : That 's close enough, Eric. I can restore him, or I can kill him, Eric. That choice is mine. Restore him, or you do n't get what you want. That choice is mine. No, no, no, no, no, you ca n't bargain, Eric. We 're in control here. Let 's check again. Who 's got the upper hand? Have n't you been paying attention? That gun wo n't do anything to us. No, but it will blow my head off. And if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the map. [COCKS_GUN] Restore him. Now. - Dad? - Eric. Son, what are you doing? Dad! [GRUNTS] You 're mine now, Eric! Like I said, we 're in control. [GROANS] [GRUNTS] [SCREAMS] [POWER_WHOOSHES], THENWARLOCKSCREAMS Phoebe. [GROANS] PIPER : Prue, watch out! That 's right, witches. Come and get me. Do n't blink. Keep them focused on me. Let him surprise them from behind. - Wait, do n't freeze him. - Why not? Did n't you hear his thoughts? He 's playing decoy. Let him think that it 's working. [POWER_WHOOSHES] [GASPS] [POWER_WHOOSHES] [SCREAMING] You know, they really should n't have given us the finger. You read my mind. [GROANS] Prue? Piper? Are you okay? I think so. What are we doing in the park? [GROANING] Who are those people? - You do n't recognize Eric? - No. Why, should I? Should I? - What 's the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party. - That was three weeks ago. Oh. - Are you all right? - Yeah, I 'm fine. I 'm fine. Just a little confused. What am I doing here? You do n't recognize her? No. Wait, I think I 've seen you at the hospital. - Who 's the cute guy? - Shh. [GRUNTS] - Dad? - Eric. Oh, my God! You 're... You 're better! - What 's going on? What 's happening? - I do n't know. - Did we do something good? - You did something incredible. - Okay, what am I thinking? - Uh... That Dan 's gon na leave without me. - Nope. Good, the spell is reversed. - What a relief. I think we 've proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that man and, especially, woman are n't meant to hear each other 's thoughts. Definitely. Too much knowledge, whether it comes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just dangerous stuff. - So, what were you thinking? I was thinking what it shame it was that Phoebe finally met a nice guy, and she 's not even gon na remember it. [DOOR_CLICKS_OPEN] - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Uh, they 're gorgeous. They 're for you. The florist left them on the porch. But there 's no card. - They 're huge. - They 're expensive. [RINGING] They 're ringing. - Ooh. Hello? - Oh, no! Dan! He 's leaving. Without me. - Do n't just stand there, freeze him. - Oh, right. [POWER_WHOOSHES] I got ta go. It 's such a nifty little power. Oh, honey... Open. [LAUGHS] - Hello? - At last. I 've been calling you every 20 minutes for the last hour. - Did you like the flowers? - Jack, what do you want? You know, you are a very suspicious woman. No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Oh, come on, Prue, are you saying you 've been totally honest with me? [IMITATES_PHONE_STATIC] Jack, I ca n't hear you, the phone 's breaking up! I just... I wanted to apologize. Can I...? Can I take you for dinner? - I do n't think so. - Come on. Let me buy you a drink. - I do n't think so. - Can I at least get my phone back? I do n't think so. [DIAL_TONE_BUZZES] [LAUGHING] - Oh, I like it. - What are you doing? I 'm calling Tokyo. Konnichiwa. Excuse me. I 'm looking for a Dr Schlenzig. I need him to sign some insurance papers. I was told he 'd be in here. Uh, yeah, he actually just took Mrs Bruen to the sunroom. - You could probably catch him there. - Great. Thanks. You 're Phoebe, right? I 'm Eric Bragg. I think I saw you the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your father? Oh, he 's better, thanks. He 's almost back to his old self. I remember you were really sweet to him when he was in here. Not many people would have bothered. - You must be an angel. - No, I 'm no angel. But I could probably introduce you to one if you 'd like. You know, I just realized, I have no idea where the sunroom is. Um, it 's kind of complicated. Maybe I should draw you a map.
