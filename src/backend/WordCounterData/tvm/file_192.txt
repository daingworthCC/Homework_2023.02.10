Uh-uh. 500 in Brooklyn, 750 in the city. That 's what Coco said. 22 plus 44 plus 20 equals... Is... 83. Okay, we got 83k right here. My dad 's definitely gon na wonder how I paid off my student loans. $83,000. Maybe I 'll just do it slowly, like once a week. Is it bad that I do n't feel bad about this, like, at all? I felt way worse when I was waiting tables. Remember this moment. Everything 's about to change. Open up! Police! You 've got two seconds to open this door! Just leave it. Go, go, go. Open up! Do you wan na get caught, is that what you want? What the fuck is wrong with you? Coco 's gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Whoa, put that thing down. You scared the shit out of me!

I think so. Okay. Thanks. Shit. They took the stuff, all of it. It 's a fucking miracle we got away. Last night? About 80 worth. No, no, no, nobody saw us. No, we were just unpacking and weighing it. I swear, we had no time to sell any of it. Somebody 's in here! What? Good morning. Tickets, please. Uh... You look very familiar. I 'm a model and an actress, so you 've probably seen my face... No, I, uh... I do n't watch TV. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Okay, you can stop pretending like you do n't know me now. Goddess Vesper. Listen, my friend and I do n't have tickets. Your friend?

What the fuck you looking at? Lick it. Thank you, Goddess. Thank you. Watch where you 're going. You watch where I 'm going, asshole. Hey, are you sure she 's gon na be there long? Possibly. What if she got a caretaker? You always come back, you old witch. Coco called. Shit. What did he say? We have to be back here in two days, noon or sooner. We 've got 48 hours, starting now. So how do you wan na do this? Well, you know Daphne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that. We 'll need to search the whole house to find the safe. To do so, we 're gon na have to play the game. We 're doing the game we do every day. " Hospital. " We have to play. That 's boring. We have to play. That 's annoying. I hate it. I 'm Dr. Petula. Welcome to my doll 's hospital. Well, Doctor, this is my daughter Tilda, and she is n't feeling well. No wonder. We 're playing your stupid game. Lay down, daughter. I 'm not gon na let you two tell me what to do because you 're not my mom! Yes, I am your mom. You 're not! Yes, I am! Stop it! Once we get into the house, whatever she asks you to do, you 're gon na have to do it. No excuses. She says, we obey. Is that clear? Tilda, is that clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey, darling. How was school? It was good. They let us out early. I 'm hungry. Of course. Of course you are! I was just about to start cooking. Remember the rules. Rule number one : Everyone must play.

He 'll be here any minute. What are you still doing here? Because my nails are n't dirty. I 'll do it myself. Come here! Mom? Mom! Help me. Get in. Come on. Mom, the doctor 's here! How are you doing, ma'am? Welcome back, Doctor. Inhale for me. Exhale. Everything looks fine here. How strange. She 's been coughing all week. I 'll prescribe something for that.

Oh, darling, what do we say to the doctor, hmm? " Thank you, Doctor. " All done. She 's shy. Doctor, can I get you something to drink or a snack perhaps? I made some ice-cold lemonade... You forgot to measure me. I was just about to measure you. Where are you, tape? Tape. Did you forget it, Doctor? No, I 'm positive I put it in here. Rule number three : Nobody leaves. Shh. Doctor, is everything okay? Yes, ma'am, all 's good. Doctor? Could you please pass the salt? We have 41 hours left. There 's not much time. Doctor... you must be exhausted. Why do n't I show you to your room? Well, sleep well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to have you back. Tilda? Hello, Doctor. I just came down to get a glass to water. But of course. I ca n't sleep. I better get back to bed. Please stay. I feel safe around you. Are you trying to bounce, bitch? What the fuck is wrong with you? You scared me! Holy shit. Put that thing down. And do n't fuck with the mailbox until we 're done, okay? Okay, I was just checking my phone. Geez, are you fucking serious? You wan na get caught? Is that what you want? No, Petula. I do n't wan na get caught. I just wan na get this over with fucking ASAP, okay? What if she put everything in a bank account? What if she did n't? Well, how much did she give you for the physical? I do n't know. I did n't look yet. Shit. Are you fucking kidding me? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is wrong with her? It 's all right. Just relax. Coco 's gon na slit our fucking throats! We have 28 hours left. Plenty of time to find the safe. Then let 's get cracking, and let 's do it now, okay? God, you have no idea what fucking crazy cuckoo Daphne made me do last night. What? She made me, like... fuck her. What? God. Really do n't make me say it again. I fucking heard you. I fucking heard you! Shh! Oh, my God. Did she make you come? Did she pay you? Oh, my God. Poor Daphne. She 's fucking obsessed, man. Aw, are you okay, girl? Yeah. Yeah, I 'm perfect. Can I have some yum yum, please? Uh, I think you 've had enough. I thought we were splitting it 50/50? Yeah, we are, but I 'm not gon na share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binge on it now, Snow White. Just give it to me. Okay. Geez, have it. Thank you. The fucking big deal is. Just some Vicodin. Tilda, this is not Vicodin. What? How much have you been taking? What did you give me? Tilda, Tilda. Tilda. Tilda! Let 's go to the tree house. Tilda, Tilda. Hey, look at me. You 're really high right now. You 've taken a lot of PCP, like a lot. You have no fucking idea. Okay, make room, Tills, I 'm coming in. I 'm just gon na be right back, okay, Tilda? Just stay right there. We 're doing the game we do every day. We have to play. That 's boring. We have to play. I do n't care. I 'm Dr. Petula. Welcome to my doll 's hospital. Well, this is my daughter Tilda. She is n't feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game. I 'm not gon na let you two boss me around to play this stupid game because you 're not my mom! Yes, I am! You 're not! Yes, I am! Stop it, stop it! It 's not our fault. Remember that. I know. But if we do get caught lying, we 'll never get to see Daphne again. I know, I know. Hi. Hi. Hi. I 'm Detective Siegel. I came to find out what happened. We were playing in the tree house, and Daphne just fell out. How exactly did she just fall out? Um... Mrs. Peters? Yes. Your granddaughter 's doing fine. She just woke up. Ohh! But her lower abdomen has been critically damaged. Unfortunately, I doubt she 'll ever be able to conceive. Oh, my God. No! Tilda! Tilda! We got ta go! We got ta go now! Come on, we got ta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phones, please? Siegel, where the hell are you? Montpellier Police Station, Detective Siegel. Yes, ma'am. I 'll take care of her personally. My dolls. Shh, my darlings. It 's okay. Mother is here. Mother has always been here, but now you 're back where you belong. Oh, shh, shh, shh. All is well, my darlings. My dolls... Hey, stop it! My silly girls. You were never fit for the outside world. In this house, nothing has changed. Shh. I 've never changed. Here, everything is possible! You know, a mother must always forgive her children. We are a family. Shh! Quiet now, quiet. Reality will never keep up with our dreams. Girls? You stay put now. Mother will be right back. Detective. Can I help you? Good evening, Miss Peters. It appears your neighbors have been hearing unusual noises coming from your home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night. Oh, God. Oh, God, this is embarrassing. I, um... I 've recently changed my medications, and you see, I 've, um... I 'm still getting adjusted. I apologize for that. No, no, it 's okay. No need to apologize. Loneliness can make us do strange things. Well, I can guarantee I will do my best to make sure these... unusual noises end. Thank you so much stopping by, Detective Siegel. It 's so thoughtful of you. Goodbye. Do you mind if I just take a look at that leak? I 'm sorry? This leak here. How long has this been going on for? Um, I do n't know. When was the last time any maintenance was done on the house? Oh, I do n't know. My grandparents were the ones taking care of the maintenance. You 'll have to excuse me. I 'm just... I 'm still in mourning. My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they passed together and so suddenly. Oh! Do n't worry about that. I 've got it. I... I 'll get it. I remember these two. You girls were inseparable. Whatever happened to them? Well, I do n't know. You do n't keep in touch? No. Really? Why not? My grandparents believed them to be a poor influence on me. Yes, of course. They were on a TV show not too long ago. Did you see it? No. I did n't grow up with television. It 's odd though, do n't you think? After all this time, not a single phone call or an email. No, I do n't own a computer. Right. Probably for the best. Those girls... they 're no good, Miss Peters. They 're dangerous, let me tell you that. They 're not dangerous. They 're geniuses. Even my grandparents did n't understand poetry like they do. They 're brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't know them. Miss Peters... You do n't know them like I know them! I 'm not trying to upset you. No! No! The world never deserved them. The outside world always rejected them! Rejected? Now you 're going to see what it 's like... to live without them. Where are they? Where are they? I do n't... No! What? How 'd you know they went missing? Um... Their disappearance is n't national news, Miss Peters, so you could n't have read about it. You do n't have a TV, you do n't have a computer, you never leave the house. You just told me that they have n't contacted you in years, so how would you have known that they went missing? Miss Peters? Officer, may I see your search warrant, please? Because if you do n't have one, I suggest you leave. Right now. Unless you want me to call the police station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home of the town lunatic! You 're close to retirement, are n't you, Detective Siegel? If I were you, I 'd wan na retire with a little dignity. If I get any more complaints, Miss Peters, I 'm gon na have to come back with a warrant. But you wo n't mind. It 's not like you 're hiding two fugitives in your attic. Par... Pardon me? That 's right. They 're not just missing. They 're wanted, Miss Peters. But I understand your need to protect them. But in the end... who 's gon na protect you from them? Take care. Now no one can come in. I will always keep you safe. I promise. Now, please, sit. Oh, Tilda, go wash your hands first. Doctor. Doctor, I know what you 're here for. And I 've been dying to play. Into our rotting mansion 's halls, look for signs along the way. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mirror end your days. But caution, dear Doctor, for you 're not too far from hell. And the grave will open wide when you shatter time 's spell! Time 's spell? But, but... if you finish the game before me, I 'll let you go, and I 'll take the blame. The blame for what? What are you talking about? The grave will open wide! What? Whose grave? Our rotting mansion 's halls! Where 's Tilda? Oh, Doctor! Dear Doctor, it 's too late. What did you do? Tilda! It 's too late. Oh, my God, Tilda. The grave will open wide when you shatter time 's spell. What? Just listen to the riddle, and you 'll find the clues to the safe, okay? Just go. Daughter, where are you? Just go. Go find the safe. Go. We 're running out of time. Just go. Darling! Stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go waltz about with my dolls. Go waltz about with my dolls. Go waltz about with my dolls. Our rotting mansion 's halls. Rotting mansion 's halls. Rotting mansion 's halls, rotting mansion 's halls. Rotting mansion... Come on. Fuck. Into our rotting mansion 's halls, look for signs along the way. Look for signs along the way. And let the mirror end your days. Let the mirror end your day. Let the mirror end your day. " Shatter time 's spell. " Shatter time 's spell. What does that mean? Come on, how do you shatter time 's spell? Petula is still trying to escape. Daphne will get her. Daphne always gets her. I got it. I got it. I found it. What? The safe. I found the safe. No, it 's okay. She agreed to it. Agreed to what? To letting us go. We found the safe. We can keep the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on. Then we can commit her. But how? What do you mean, how? We can pay Coco back. We can move out of that shitty crack cave we live in. Come on, this is a new, fresh fuckin ' start, Tilda. Come on, get your shit. We are getting out of here tonight. Come on. Shit. Watch yourself. Petula, hold up! Slow down! Hey! Hey, hey! Stop! Are you fucking kidding me? Fucking asshole! No. Fuck! You wan na fucking help me? Not just sit there? What do you want me to do? What am I supposed to do? Help me! Help me flag down one of the fucking cars! It 's not gon na make a difference if I stand up or not. I 'm fucking tired! I 'm fucking tired, Tilda! Come on! Just shut the fuck up. Are you serious right now? Nobody 's fucking out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Where 's Tilda? Oh, she 's in bed. Would you like to see her? You said if we found the safe, then you 'd let us go. I said you could go. And I said you had to finish the game first, and you have n't. She 's awake. Would you like me to take you to her? No. There we are. Tilda? Daughter. Hello, dearest. Say hello, darling. Darling girl, do n't be rude. Oh, this night is so exhilarating. You know, it reminds me... of the night... that I poisoned my grandparents. They wanted to get me a caretaker. Like I was some kind of crazy person. No, Mother. Mother, please do n't. Mother, please, please do n't. Mother, please! You, keep your eyes open. I have n't taken those yet. Daphne, no. Take that away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Guy says he 's seen the missing girls. Oh, yeah? Outside the train station. They look mermaids on crack. You seen these two girls? You positive? Yeah. Them 's the mermaids. Now, where 's my reward? You also see flying cats, you quack. How long ago? Come on. You 're not a bum? No. Get outta here. Get him outta here. Hello, Tilda. Petula. I 've come to tell you that the game is over. So you can go now. It 's been fun. Oh. Before I go, a goodbye gift. Drug dealers, huh? You know, maybe they wo n't recognize you with the scars. Well, you wanted to leave so badly, so why do n't you just leave? Clear this room immediately! There 's lots to be done before the baby comes. These walls need to be repainted and... What the fuck are you talking about, Daphne? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitch. You ca n't be. You 're insane. You know that, right? I mean, you must know that. Please keep your voice down. The stress is n't good for the baby. What baby? There 's no baby. You 're barren.
