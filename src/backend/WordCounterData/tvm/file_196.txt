I just witnessed that boy chastise baby girl again. Oh. Oh, my goodness, Mother. You have outdone yourself this time. Now, soon as you are done with your lunch, baby girl, you can pick up a few things at the market. A loaf of bread, stick a butter, and a gallon of milk. Jesus Christ. Told you she was a freak.

Earlier today in Killsoma Park, two teenagers were found dead. Names have not been released to the public until family members have been notified. Authorities have stated there is possibly a wild animal on the loose and are warning folks that it is in their best interest to stay inside their homes until the animal is contained. Now, back to our regularly scheduled program. Somebody 's had a busy day today. It looks like Father put your gear back together. He 's always been so good at fixing things. Those mean children wo n't hurt you or anybody again. It 's a shame what happened. I wonder what sort of animal it was? Tomorrow 's a new day. Have I told you how much I love you? Yes, you have. I know what you did. Huh? Do n't be coy. I know what you did for princess. With that little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations. Those children had it coming to them and you took charge.

It 's his first day. Oh. Thank you. They do n't see too many new faces around here. You know, small town, everybody knows everybody. Ah, hot. And strong. I 'm Abby. Peter. Peter, you drink coffee all day or can I get you something to eat? Oh. What 's good? You look like a savory kind of guy. The Eggs Benny 's great. Okay. Eggs Benedict. Here you go. Thank you.

Okay. Take care, Peter. Bye. Abby. Finally. Coffee. Have a seat. I did n't think I 'd see you again. You do n't belong here, Peter. I did n't know where else to go. You do n't know what it 's like. I do n't know what it 's like? Throwing up all the time, shaking and trembling so bad I can barely get up off the floor. Sorry, Sam. I know. I just did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this alone. You are alone, Peter. What do I do? It 's making me so sick. I do n't know how to stop. The only way to stop is to end it. There 's no more help. You have to let it go. How? You want help, you need to be ready. You need to accept what it is and deal with it. If you want out you have to do what I did. Sam, I need you. Sam. Hey, I did n't thinkI 'd see your face again. Are you okay? Yeah. Do you want something else? You do n't belong here. Sir, I 'm sorry but I do n't know you. Billy, come on, go sit down.

They 're just trying to fatten you up a little. It 's gon na be okay, I promise. Now you have to tell me the truth. Did you do it? Mrs. Van derSloot, you may begin. Yes, Mr. Stonewright. You were at the scene of the supposed crime my client is accused of, correct? That 's correct. What were you doing that day? I was walking my dog. On the corner of 48th andMain, correct? Yes, that 's correct. And what did you see? I saw that man walking about 50 feet ahead of me. And the child? She was only a few feet in front of him. And then what happened? Well, the little girl was n't paying attention. Occasionally she would hop off the sidewalk into the street. And that 's when the incident occurred. That 's correct. I saw that man push her. Push her? Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malicious in nature? He definitely was pushing her with a large amount of force. Into oncoming traffic? That 's correct. Let me ask the question one more time. Do you feel that my client had malicious intent when he shoved the child that day? Absolutely, he had hate in his eyes. No further questions, Your Honor. Mr. Wrenson, you may proceed. Mr. Stonewright, would you consider yourself a moral man? Remember, you are under oath. No. No? I do n't consider myself moral. I cheat on my taxes, watch my neighbor undress through the window, occasionally shoplift. I even ate my dog later that day. You know, immoral stuff like that. Typical, right? Now, all that may be true. You may do all those very immoral things, however, is it true that you secretly donate food to shelters every month? Objection, relevance? Overruled. Is it true? Mr. Stonewright, we have plenty of evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes, yes, I do. You do what, Mr. Stonewright? Speak loudly so the jury can hear you. I donate food to shelters, on occasion. Now, would you consider this a moral act? Yes, but... But what, Mr.Stonewright? The food was poisoned, I swear to you. It should have made everyone in the shelter deathly ill. But it did n't, Mr.Stonewright. Now, since you are a self-confessed moral, do you honestly think the jury should believe what you saw that day? Answer the question. No. Did you see Mr. Booth shove the girl in front of oncoming traffic? Or was Mr. Booth being moral also? I ca n't be sure. Ca n't be sure. Could he have been pushing her out of harm 's way? You said the child was stepping in and out of the street carelessly. Yes. Would you say it 's possible that Mr. Booth saved the child 's life instead of attempting to end it? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Maybe. Yes. No further questions, Your Honor. Now, Mrs. Paddington, you were driving the car that fateful day, correct? That 's right. I was heading down 48th, about to cross Denver when I saw Mr. Booth shoveAllison Grove into traffic. And what did you do then? I accelerated. You accelerated? Yes. I hit the accelerator as hard asI could. I wanted to smear that kid. Okay, but you just missed her. Yes. Sadly. I agree, would have been nice and messy. Objection, she 's leading the witness. I 'll allow it. Now, since you were behind the wheel, how clearly could you see the defendant? Very clearly. He was most definitely attempting to push Allison with the intention of harm. No further questions. Mr. Wrenson. Mrs. Paddington, why did n't you hit Allison Grove with your car? You seemed very excited to do so. I just missed her. It was very disappointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. And yet there were obvious tire tracks matching your tires ' tread on your vehicle. Seems to me you were breaking and swerving. The evidence does n't lie. Objection, my witness is not on trial. Overruled. We were able to obtain Mrs.Paddington 's phone records for the exact moment of the crime. If it pleases the court, I would like to submit this evidence into testimony. Now, Mrs. Paddington, according to your phone records you were texting at the exact moment of the crime. I will remind you, you 're still under oath. Yes. And were you texting, or should I say sexting, a man by the name of Norman Davis? That 's correct. He 's my fuckbuddy. Now, if true, and you were texting at that exact moment, how could you possibly have seen the defendant push Allison Grove? I... Am I to assume that while you were texting your lover you were n't paying attention to the road? Yes. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl you swerved to miss her? Yes. No further questions, Your Honor. Has the jury reached a verdict? Yes, we have, Your Honor. On the count of failure to commit first degree murder, we the jury find the defendant, Nathan Booth, guilty. In keeping with the verdict, I sentence you, Nathan Michael Booth, to death by consumption. Sentence to be carried out immediately following this session. Court is adjourned. Nathan, be honest with me, did you do it? Yeah, I did. She was walking in front of a car and I pushed her out of the way. When did you know? Know what? That you were one of them. I 've always known. You know, there 's more of us out there than you think there are. He confessed. Remember our agreement. He 's to be given a quick death and no pain. I hope they choke on me. Our streets! Our streets! Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! Our streets! Congrats, Calvin, another winYou forgot your to-go bag, dear. He did n't have much meat on his bones. He had a lotta guts though. Why do you do it, defend them? Someone has to. I must say, I prefer you this way. I got ta make my clients feel comfortable somehow. The world needs me, you know. Got ta have some semblance of order in the chaos. What will you do when there are no more of them left? I 'm sure I 'll find a hobby. Though I think it will get pretty boring. This is a simple procedure with low risk of complication. You 'll be under for about three hours and you wo n't feel a thing. When you wake up, we 'll talk about it then. Do you have any questions? No, I 'm okay, thank you. Good. I 'm just gon na lower you down a little bit so you 're lying flat. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need you to count down from 10. Breathe. 10. Nine. Yeah, just breathe. Eight. Seven. Keep breathing. Six. That 's good. Five. Just relax. Four. Relax. Three. Two
