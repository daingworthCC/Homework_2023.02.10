5211241 VAMPIRES : THE TURNING up by SpringBay, thanks to friends. For centuries, Phii Song Neng have lived among the villages of the Far East. Blessed with eternal youth... we vow not to take human life. But long ago, I broke the vow and new vampires emerged. Jai tham : black hearts who feed on humans and kill for pleasure. Only I can end the curse... and the jai tham 's nightly attacks on the innocent. In doing so, I would end the entire bloodline... turning every vampire of Siam mortal. The only way my spirit can be free. Songkran, our New Year, approaches. The beginning and the end. Look at that! Did you see that? I ca n't take this anymore. Can we go, please? It 's almost over. Amanda. - What are we doing here? - I just wanted to see this. See what? Some guy get his ass kicked... for a case of beer and a carton of cigarettes? I 've studied and trained Muay Thai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the real thing while I was here. How can this appeal to you? All it is, is brutal fighting. There 's more to it than that. There 's a philosophy. I love you, Connor. I always will. But this is n't working, and it has n't for a long time. Let 's just finish the trip, all right? We 'll go see some temple ruins, ride the elephants. Whatever you want to do, okay? No, it 's not okay. You 've got plans, and I 've got plans. They 're just not the same. - Where are you going? - Home. Amanda. No, thank you. You look lost. I 'm looking for the Crown Topper Hotel. Crown Topper? Chiang Klan Road. It 's not far from here. I 'm heading in that direction. Can I show you the way? If you do n't mind. Bad choice. - Down here? - Yes. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastest way to your hotel. And it is very safe. You look sad. Someone as beautiful as you should never look sad. - My boyfriend... - Left you alone. And someone as beautiful as you should never be left alone. You should be with someone who can give you everything you desire. Please do n't hurt me. Never. Connor. Amanda! Amanda! What did you do to her? Where is she? What the... What the hell? Get out of here. - Who the hell are you? - I said get out of here. That just ca n't be happening. You 're in the wrong place at the wrong time. Take whatever luck you have left and go. - Leave! - Listen, please. - They took my girlfriend. - Do n't go after her. You 'll just get yourself killed. And do n't go to the police. - It 'll do no good. - What am I supposed to do? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just leave her here. You got ta help me. You follow me and I 'll kill you. Sorry for delay. Everybody here to celebrate Songkran. Biggest festival of the year. Very busy. What can I do for you, sir? My girlfriend was kidnapped by these bikers. - You saw this happen? - Yeah. - Where? - The Phang Nga Market. I was looking for her, she came out of this alley... and she was on the back of one of these bikes. And it looked like she was unconscious. And I ended up getting into a fight with one of these guys. Then this other guy came and he helped me out. I think he knows something but he would n't tell me anything. So I followed him to this house down in the Kong Sai District. Did you go in this place? No, I did n't go inside. I thought I should come here first. - So you and the girl were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We got into a fight. So she angry after fight. - She leave to make jealous, yes? - No. She did n't leave to make jealous. She was kidnapped. Look, I can show you where it happened! No kidnap until missing 48 hours. Just like in USA. Go back to the hotel, see if she 's there. Buy her some silk, go home together, and everybody happy. Look, I called the hotel. She 's not there. I 'm telling you, she 's kidnapped! No, your girlfriend fine, okay? No problem. Everybody fine. Hello? Damn. Anyone there? Hello. Hello? Settle down, Sparky. Any move will be your last. - Is he a bleeder? - Do n't know. Go inside, wake up Kiko and find out what the hell 's going on. And get me a blood panel on this lad. ASAP. Who the fuck are you? Why the hell am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no sign of infection. - You hear me? - And you say he 's just an outsider? That 's what Kiko said. He must have followed them to the Kong Sai House. He 's looking for a girl that Niran fed on last night. - He 's a liability. - He 's a tourist. He does n't know anything. Smart enough to find Sang 's nest and dumb enough to go there? - Now, that 's a liability. - You hear me? I 'm looking for someone who was kidnapped by them. Why the hell am I in here? The name 's Raines, and I want you to shut up and listen to me. You 're way out of your league here, my friend. And this search of yours will only get you killed. Now, we 're prepared to take you wherever it is you 're staying... help you pack up, and get the hell out of Thailand. Wait, please. They took my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have n't killed her, they 'll turn her. Then she 's fair game. Fair game? We 're Slayers. Pro Slayers. $10,000 a head. Every head. Girlfriend or not. Wait a second, you ca n't kill her! Can and will, if she turns. When will that happen? Depends on her. It 's her choice. If she fights it, they 'll bleed her dry. Either way, she 's dead. But you 're alive. Wait a second. Let me come with you. - There still may be time. - Out of the question, me lad. Look, I can hold my own. I can help you. If the Song Neng had n't saved you in the nick of time... you 'd be a dead man. Who are the Song Neng? Long story. One you do n't need to hear. Just take my advice. Go to the police and file a missing persons report. Look, I already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about us. One last thing. Never mention the word " vampire. " You do that and they 'll think you 're crazy. And crazy people kill their girlfriends, if you catch my drift. If they have n't killed her, they 'll turn her. You 're in the wrong place at the wrong time. Do n't go after her. You 'll just get yourself killed. Either way, she 's dead. This is n't it. It 's down a little further. - Far as I take you. - Well, it 's just down the road a little. No go there. This is good. Get away! These are for Song Neng! You make big mistake, farang. You should do like they say and go home. Are you one? What you think? You lucky. They are feeding. They pretty mad about you hurt Sang. You mean the girl? You get out while you can. You crazy for sure, farang. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Then maybe you leave and save your soul. Who is that? Niran. Master of the Dead one's. Many years ago, Niran was a young warlord. One day he saw the beautiful Sang... and wanted her for his own. So he killed her husband and son. What he did not know was Sang was Song Neng... a vampire who lives on animal blood and vow not to take human life. But in her pain and rage she attacked Niran. That night, during a Songkran eclipse... Niran became the first vampire of Siam... who feeds on humans. And from Niran came the many who kill for pleasure. How long ago did all this happen? Over 800 years ago. Jesus. Wait, I 've seen this place. It 's near the Phang Nga Market. Maybe this is where he took her. Hello? He 's going after her. That could cause us problems. He loves her. Amanda? Oh, Connor. Help me. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Baby, you all right? Come on, we got ta get out of here. Come on, baby. - It hurts so bad! - You got ta be quiet. Connor. - Where is she? - She 's mine now. You take a very big chance coming here! I kill you now and it 's all over. Time to go. Kill them! Hang on! We have to get out of the light! Make a left. Hang on! - Now where? - Straight ahead, into the building. - Are you sure? - Please, just do it! - Now what? - Turn here. - Through there. - You 've got ta be kidding. Follow me. Hurry. I told her not to go. We could n't take the risk. Now the sun 's up. She 's okay. Why did you come after me? You 're strong, determined, but you 're not one of us. That does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new enemy he must contend with. It may distract him. From what? What is going on here? How far would you go to get your woman back? I just walked into a nest of vampires. What do you think? - Would you die for her? - I almost did. But, given a choice, would you? Please, no more. Stop fighting it and the pain will go away forever. I can see it in your eyes. You 're thinking about it, are n't you? How easy it would be. How painless. The power, the endless pleasure. Decision. - Just end it, please. - End it? We 're just getting started. Leave us! Rest and get ready for what is ahead. I told you not to get involved. - I do n't have a choice. - We always have a choice. Our choices define us. Like your woman. It appears that she 's chosen not to turn, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very persuasive. And the pain she 's experiencing is great. It 's just a matter of time before she weakens and turns into one of them. Then help me. We have more important things to do. Give up this death wish. Look, whatever it is you 're gon na do has to do with Niran. Let me help you. And in return, you help me. I wish you could help us... but you 're no match for a vampire 's strength. Save yourself. Are you sure we can trust him? Kiko will keep his word. He knows he ca n't do it without us. By the way, how many Slayers did you round up? Four more. Two more just arrived from Hong Kong. Well done. So to speak. I was once a Slayer like Raines. Nine years ago, I was bitten in Lampang. We were taking out one of Niran 's nests, and I got careless. On that day, I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I embraced it. But unlike Niran... I had no desire to spread this disease. So I became Song Neng. And you never satisfy your hunger by taking human life? No. That 's not to say that we do n't have cravings for human blood. But we 've all sworn never to taste it... unless a human desires it. Some do, you know, crave immortality. Eternal youth. Yes. It 's quite seductive, believe me. So what is this all about, this thing between Song Neng and Niran? The Song Neng and Niran have been at war for centuries. But we 're about to end all that. How? Sang 's spirit was born in the darkness of an eclipse. She can end the curse by embracing the light of the sun... as it moves out of another eclipse. But only if this happens in the exact place where the curse began. It 's been 800 years since the last Songkran eclipse. She 's waited that long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die. Her spirit will be reborn in sunlight. Then all the vampires that were created from her first bite will become mortal. Yes. Alive. And all the killing will end. Niran will try to stop her. He has no desire for mortality. He lusts after human blood. That 's what makes him stronger than us. - So what are you going to do? - We 've made a deal with Raines. - Together I believe we can defeat Niran. - And if not? Then we wait another 800 years. I tell you all of this because I know what you 're thinking. I would think the same thing. I see the way you look at Sang. She 's very powerful, among other things. But do not mistake desire for courage. If I was to become one of you... I would have the strength. If you were to become one of us, you 'd be condemning your soul for eternity. Not if we win. Sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gown. It was so long ago I hardly remember. But I loved him, I remember that. I 've waited 800 years, cursed to live like this. 800 years is a very long time. A very long time to wait for death... and peace. What you are considering is very dangerous. And the more you 're around us, the more it will seduce you. But it is not life. It 's death. But if what Kiko said is true... I 'd get my mortality back if we were successful. And your woman. Choices. Would you die for her? Would you die for me? - What would it be like? - Everybody 's different. But to turn, you must embrace it without hesitation. Without doubt. - I do n't know if I can do that. - Think of her. And you? You and I are just a moment in time. A very special moment. Do it. Are you sure? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? She 's mine now. We always have a choice. Either way, she 's dead. What you are considering is very dangerous. - Come on, Connor. - What? If you really want to know, just ask me. Did you? Amanda! Would you die for her? It 's just a matter of time before she weakens and turns into one of them. It 's quite seductive, believe me. You 'd be condemning your soul for eternity. Amanda! Sang must die. Would you die for me? Amanda! Did you? It 's not life. It 's death. Did you? Think of her. The eclipse begins one minute after 3:00. Totality lasts 17 minutes, 28 seconds. - No more, no less. - That 's not much time. That 's what Niran 's counting on. So what 's your plan? This is the area where the curse began. We must get Sang in there. Niran has been checking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what Sang 's gon na do? - He 's always known, from the beginning. The Slayers will position themselves before the sun 's eclipse... all around the rooftops surrounding the ruins. The unnatural night will draw Niran out into the open. The Slayers will be waiting, as shall we. Are you sure you can trust the Slayers? Raines is a Slayer. No more, no less. We 're handing him an entire nest of vampires. Oh, yes. He 'll be there. Does n't seem right that you should have to pay for what Niran did. You 're a young soul, Connor. I 've lived many lifetimes, seen way too much pain. Value the gift that you wager. To live out life... to feel the sun on your face, to grow old with someone... and pray that you get it back. Tomorrow is our day, gentlemen. No mistakes! Heads on a silver platter! It 's time to do some killing. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of day! If she succeeds, you will know death! Maybe not tomorrow, or the next day, or for years! But it will come! Blood! - We 're upstairs, sir. - Perfect. - It 's already started. - How long do we have? About nine minutes. This is Raines. Do you copy? Position number one. Roger that. Position number two in place. Over. Number three set. Now we wait. Where are they? Moments away. Here we go, mates. - This is it. - You see anything? - Not a living soul. - How about a vampire? Song Neng have the farang with them. I can see that. If he gets in the way, take him out. - That 's the place over there. - How can you be sure? This is it. Time to play. By my count, I 've got about 20. That 's about right for this nest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I hope so. You know I ca n't let you do this, Sang. It 's over, Niran. I do n't think so. All you 've done is spread evil. But I like spreading evil. You 've got a farang with you. Hey, farang, you cause me more trouble than I like, guy. So you gon na be the first to die. Whatever you 've got, let 's see it. Your woman is what I got in mind. Now! - How about now? - Not now. Soon. Let the suckers tire out a bit. So Sang has tasted the real thing, has she? Where the hell are your Slayers? I do n't know. Made a pact with the devil, did you? Time is running out! Raines! Ready, lads. Now! Good. Sang. That pretty little head should fetch a pretty penny. What have you done? Killed a bunch of vampires. That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. You did n't think I 'd keep it, did you? - He did. - Kiko was a fool. If Sang ends the curse, there 's no more vampires. Every head we bring in is worth lots of money. We 're in the vampire killing business, lad. And business is good. Less than two minutes of totality left. Gather the heads together before they fry. Do n't waste any sympathy, kid. She 's a bloodsucker. Do n't you know? They killed your girlfriend. Niran did. - She had nothing to do with it. - Whatever. Let me put her out of her misery. I do n't want to see her suffer. Straight through the heart. And do n't flinch. Put them down! Put them down, do what the man says. He 's turned. - What do you want? - Pick her up. What for? Pick her up! Move. This way. This way! Hurry! There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll give you the whole take from this kill. Niran 's bloodline is spread all over Asia. - But we got ta hurry. - Put her down. Gently. Now back away. Back away! Thank you. We 're out of time. - You 're not going anywhere. - What? This is for Kiko. No! Amanda.
