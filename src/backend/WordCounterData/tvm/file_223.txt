Yes, mr. Garrison, have a seat. Mr. Garrison, some time ago you asked to be promoted From teaching kindergarten back to the 3rd grade. I 'm aware of that. I want to come clean with you and tell you that back then Some of us were uncomfortable with your sexual preferences. It was wrong of us, and i want to make it up to you. Wow, that 's really great to hear. As you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available, And we 'd like to offer you the job. Oh, for real?! You 're not kidding? We in administration see now that you are an individual With your own preferences, and we respect that. Oh, this is all just- A dream come true! Thank you, principal victoria! I 'll do a great job! I know you will! You 're sure this for real? I mean, i 'm not just gon na get fired again for being gay tomorrow? It 's for real, mr. Garrison. Oh, great! With all the new laws We could never fire you for being gay now-You 'd be able to sue us for millions of dollars. Right, i-What, what was that? Well, i was just saying that the policies have really changed. You know, if we fired you for acting gay next time, You 'd be able to sue the school district for lots of money. Oh, right, right. How, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the case out in minnesota Where the guy was awarded 25 million i think. You-You do n't say. Well, thanks, principal victoria. Holy moly! I 've got ta find a way to get fired for being gay! M'kay, kids, i know the past few weeks have been really hard With the death of your teacher, ms. Choksondik. That 's funny! But the principal has finally hired a teacher to take her place. So i want you all to give your best behavior To your new 4th grade teacher, mr. Garrison. Not him! Thank you, mr. Mackey. Good luck, m'kay. Okay, children, now for those of you who are new, My name is mr. Garrison. Where 's mr. Hat, sir? Well, i was informed that 4th graders Are a little too old for mr. Hat. Two-Year-Olds are too old for mr. Hat. But it 's okay, because i found a new teacher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, kids. Hmm. So that 's mr. Slave, the teacher 's assistant. Or, as i like to write for short - The teacher 's ass. Oh, jesus christ. Okay, mr. Slave, go sit until i need you. Ah! Dude, i think that mr. Slave guy might be a - Pakistani. I 'm not saying the rest of the school year is going to be easy. In fact, it 's going to be long and hard-Really long and really hard. Oh, jesus christ. The first thing we 're gon na be learning about Is communist russia. No, kenny - What are you doing, kenny? Now, stalin was a big silly when he... Kenny, no! Do n't do it, kenny! Eric, did you just throw a paper airplane?! No, it was kenny! Very funny, eric, kenny 's dead! Yeah, but cartman drank kenny 's remains And now kenny 's soul is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it! I will not put up with foolishness in my class! It 's time for punishment. Take it, mr. Slave! Oh! Oh, it hurts! I will not put up with tomfoolery In my classroom, children! Mr. Slave, put this rubber ball in your mouth. Take that, slave, take it! This should get me fired for sure! I really enjoyed the imagery In the last chapter of this month 's book. Yes, and i really saw the entire book, thematically, As a take on corporate america. I think in the fourth chapter, When nancy drew discovers the bloody glove In the cheerleader 's locker, That was just a brilliantly written passage. So full of metaphor! Hey guys, can we talk to you? Oh, hi, boys! How was school? Uh, not cool. Great. We 're having our book-Of- The-Month club meeting, So why do n't you boys go outside and play. Was it me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riddle of elephant mountain a little too easily? Oh yes. For sure. No, no, he said not cool. We got our new teacher today. It 's mr. Garrison, our old 3rd grade teacher. Uh-Huh. Well, he has this new teacher 's assistant, And they 're both- Totally gay. Kyle! You know better than to discriminate against homosexuals! Yeah, but these guys are really super gay. I 'm surprised at you, stanley. I really thought you knew how to accept people for who they were. Yeah, but, dad-No buts, stanley. We 're not raising our kids to be discriminators. That 's right, i think it 's time you kids took a little trip To the museum of tolerance. Welcome to the museum of tolerance. Here we try to educate you on the dynamics Of racism and prejudice in america. Ow! Now, did you know that words we use can show intolerance? Let 's begin our tour with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you what it can feel like To be discriminated against. Queer! Beaner! Chink! Nigger! Heeb! Faggot! Cracker! Oh man, this is awesome! Now you know how it feels. I wan na ride again! I wan na ride again! We are now entering the " hall of stereotypes ". These wax figures represent How some intolerant people have labeled minorities. Here, we see a black person eating chicken and watermelon, A stereotype that hurts the african-American community. What other stereotypes do you see here? Ah, here 's the arab as a terrorist. That 's right, but of course we know That not all arabs are terrorists, do n't we, kids? Well, there 's an asian man with a calculator. That 's right, not all stereotypes are negative. But even a positive one, like " all asians are good at math " Is harmful to society. Look! A covetous jew! Very good, young man. The idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Ah, here 's a good one. It 's the stereotypical " sleepy mexican ". Wha - What? Oh man, what time is it? I 'm sorry, i thought you were a wax sculpture. No, man, i 'm the janitor. I 'm supposed to be cleaning but i 'm so tired. Ooh, i so sleepy. This is our discovery wing. Take your time at the computer displays, because you see, Being tolerant you must also learn To respect people who are small, people who are disabled, Even people who are overweight, like this young man here. Ay! You other boys have probably called this young man names Like " tubby ", or " lard butt " or " fat tits ". Fat tits- That 's a good one. Yeah, have to remember that. But you must learn be tolerant of his differences as well. If he chooses to eat fatty foods, That 's his life choice. I 'm not fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't belittle you for eating Lots of cookies and cakes and pies. Dude, tolerance kicks ass! That 's our cartman. Well, that 's the end of our tour. Now do you see why tolerance is so important, boys? I guess. We have to accept people for who they are And what they like to do. Hey! What the hell are you doing?! I was just-There 's no smoking in the museum! But i 'm not in the museum. Get out of here, you filthy smoker! Yeah, dirty lungs! Go ahead and kill yourself, stupid tar breath! Dumbass! Get outta here! Well, have a great day, everybody. Now you boys can go and give your teacher and assistant The respect they deserve, right? Yeah. Okay, children, let 's take our seats. Apparently none of you tried to get me fired yesterday, So i guess we 're just gon na have to go on And learn more today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water When we heat it up in the bunsen burner? It evaporates! Good, butters. Now, if we take the glass tube of the bunsen burner, We can also see how other things react. Evaporation is an exothermic reaction-So now let 's look at an endothermic one. Mr. Slave, position 7, please. Now i 'm gon na put the glass tube into mr. Slave 's tight ass. The heat from mr. Slave 's ass Will act as our new conductor of energy. Ahh! Okay, now butters, Could you bring over lemmiwinks for me, please? Sure! Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. Newton was the first to discover that for every action There is a reaction- Thank you, butters-Now what do you think is gon na happen When i introduce the element of the gerbil To the endothermic heat of mr. Slave 's ass? Well, let 's see. Ahh! Oh, jesus. Jesus christ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, chef! How 's it going? Bad. Why bad? Chef, we 're intolerant. Intolerant of who? Gays, i guess. Now why do you wan na go be intolerant Of gay people, children? I thought you knew better! Well, we did n't think we were, But mr. Garrison has this new assistant, And we 're really uncomfortable around them. Children, a lot of times, The reason people get uncomfortable around gay people Is that they have some issues themselves. You have to ask yourself, " what is it about their behavior That for some reason makes me uncomfortable? " Well, i guess it 's mostly the way Mr. Garrison stuck a gerbil up mr. Slave 's ass. Right, and you see, children, That 's why you need to- Whoa, what?! Are we homophobes now? We do n't wan na be gay bashers, chef! Children, there 's a big difference between gay people And mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children just take your lunches. I 'm gon na have a talk with the principal. I 'll take three lunches today, please. You do n't need three lunches, eric, You 're fat enough as it is. It is my life choice, chef, And if you do n't tolerate it i 'll report you to the s.C.C. That was a brilliant idea Having me put a gerbil up your ass, mr. Slave! Now we 'll get fired for sure! Well, it was n't the first small animal i put up my ass. Mr. Garrison to the principal 's office, please. That 's it! They 're gon na fire me for being gay! 25 million, here we come! Do n't forget, i get half! Ooh! Ooh, jesus christ. Lemmiwinks, you must find your way out of this place Or you will surely die. This way has been closed off by the great sphincter. To escape, you must journey upward through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who am i? Just a friend. Heed my words, lemmiwinks, your time is running out. Make for the large intestine. All will be made clear then. * a great adventure is waiting for you ahead * * hurry onward, lemmiwinks or you will soon be dead * * the journey before you may be long and filled with woe * * but you must escape the gay man 's ass * * so your tale can be told * * lemmiwinks, lemmiwinks lemmiwinks, lemmiwinks * * doot doot doot do do doo * * doot doo do doo You wanted to see me, principal victoria? Oh, yes, mr. Garrison, have a seat. Oh dear, sounds like i 'm getting fired. * doot doot doot doot do-Do-Do doo * Mr. Garrison, chef has brought it to my attention That some of the students are a bit... uncomfortable About certain aspects of your teaching methods. Oh, no, you 're firing me?! Oh well, i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't help the way god made me. Guess i just have to go! No, no, no! We 're not firing you. You 're not? No, we 're sending chef to a tolerance seminar. Sending chef to a tolerance seminar?! You got to be crazy! You 've demonstrated a lack of tolerance For mr. Garrison 's behavior. In fact, i believe you used to words " sick queer " To describe his conduct in class. He is a sick queer! Yeah! I just wanted to give you an opportunity To apologize to mr.Garrison before i sent you away, chef. Kiss my black ass! Parents, i had to call you in here because your boys Have refused to attend class With their homosexual teachers, m'kay. We 're not staying in class another minute With those queermos! Well, i really thought you boys learned something At the museum of tolerance. But apparently all you learned Was new words to call your poor teachers! But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll speak when spoken to! Yes, sir. Mr. Mackey, we 've done everything we can To raise compassionate children. We do n't know where else to turn! Well, there is an intensive seminar camp. It 's a bit severe, but it might be the only way, m'kay. That sounds good to me. Me too! Then it 's settled. Boys, you 're going to tolerance camp! Tolerance camp? Velcome to tolerance camp. You are here because you would not accept people 's differences. Because you refused to accept the life choices Of your fellow man. Well, those days are now over. Here you will vork, every hour of every day Until you submit to being tolerant of everybody. Here, intolerance... will not be tolerated. God dammit! How 'd it go? This is unbelievable, mr. Slave! It seems no matter what i do i ca n't get fired! The principal did n't fire you? No! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Attend my class anymore That they want to give me the " courageous teacher " award This friday at the museum of tolerance! Oh, jesus christ. I mean, i stuck a gerbil up your ass And they want to give me a goddamn medal! Well, it sounds to me like the principal Is just hiding things from everybody. What you need to do is let the parents see What kind of demented faggot you are. Oh, well - Hey, that 's right, mr. Slave. The parents have to see for themselves. The award ceremony! We 'll put on a show they 'll never forget! Ooh, jesus christ. * lemmiwinks journeyed a distance far and fast * * to find his way out of a gay man 's ass * * the road ahead is filled with danger and fright * * but push onward, lemmiwinks with all of your might * Lemmiwinks!

It is my honor to present the courageous teacher award to-Herbert garrison. * dump de dump de dumpity dump de dump * * dumpity dump Get along, little slave. Oh my god. That 's what our boys were talking about? Ding ding! Ding ding! He is so courageous. Say, mr. Slave... Yes, mr. Garrison? I had a dream last night that you were a real dick. Really?
