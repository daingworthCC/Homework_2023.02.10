5244441 Previously on " Royal Pains "... Of course I 'm upset at situation. We 've been evicted. - Hello, Hank. - Hi, Charlotte. Rafa 's filed a lawsuit. He 's no longer asking for joint custody.( Sighs) Now he wants sole custody. Divya! Raj? Oh... -( Laughing) : Oh, my gosh. - Ah. So what did your lawyer say? She 's working on a visitation plan for Rafa, visitation on U.S. soil only. I 've got a brilliant divorce attorney, - if you need a second opinion. - Raj, I am so sorry it did n't work out. I am purchasing Hamptons Heritage. I would like all of you to serve on the hospital 's board of directors.???? - You ready? - I am.( Boris) : Hank? - I need you. - Boris, Charlotte - and I were just going to... - Now.( @overlappping_chatter) Where... where 's the attending? He 's over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball when it happened. Median sternotomy.( Whirring) Hank, I am so sorry, but I need you. Divya, I 'm kind of in the middle of something. Now! Hank? She was in the motorcade when it struck the basketball court. - Okay, uh, turn this way. -( Gasping)( Grunting) Thank you.( Paige) : Come on, stay with me, babe. Evan? What the hell happened? He was trying to talk his way into the motorcade, which is why it crashed into the basketball court. Really, Evan? Again? Why am I always cleaning up your messes? Keep pumping, babe. Oh, my God, such a beautiful ring. Charlotte! Charlotte? Charlotte! Charlotte! Charlotte!( Gasps) - Mm. - What 's wrong? Oh. Uh... I just, uh... I just had a really weird nightmare. Aww. About what? Um... The ER and, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved all that. Yeah, I thought so too, but... I do n't know, maybe I 'm more annoyed than I thought. What are you annoyed about?( Chuckles) About the fact that Boris called for a board meeting for tomorrow.( Chuckles) I want to be with you on your last day in town. All day. And I want it to be... perfect. It will be, as long as I get my eight hours of sleep, or else you 'll have a real nightmare on your hands.( Laughs) - Okay? - Okay.?? Do n't worry, the administrator here is insanely efficient. Like, Boris does n't even come to the meetings anymore. So it 'll be, like, an hour, tops. Great. Why are you so pressed for time, anyway? I want to spend every last second I can with Charlotte before she leaves. Oh, my God, she 'll be back, and you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very sweet and totally nauseating. Hey, hey, uh... I 'm sorry you and I have n't hung out much lately, which is why I have n't had a chance to tell you something important. Can we talk if and when this meeting ever ends? I can save you the time, Hank. I did n't forget what we talked about when you joined the board, okay? We will watch each other 's backs, and I will make sure you do n't get pulled any deeper into this commitment. - Thank you, Evan. - Yeah. Means a lot to hear you say that. Really, but that 's not at all what I wanted to talk to you about. Hmm. - Hey! - Hey. How was the new lawyer? I wish she was n't necessary. I wish that Rafa and I had been able to work it out when he was here last week, but the custody battle for Sashi is now in very capable hands. Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think of a better way to spend your money. Agreed. Where 's Jeremiah? He had to go to Philadelphia to interview research candidates for the lab, but he gave me his proxy. Why do n't I get his proxy? Why would he give you his proxy? - Because he and I are... - Both doctors? Highly intelligent? You know what, enjoy your voting power, Divya. Just do n't you dare use it against me. Boris, you 're here. Indeed, and I suggest we begin. There 's much to discuss. So the first order of business is to name an interim replacement for the hospital administrator. What? Yeah, what happened to the one we have? Had. He quit. Something about an opportunity closer to home. Huh... he seemed so committed to the job. We need someone reliable who is familiar with the inner workings of the hospital, someone... trustworthy. - Mr. Lawson? - Boris, before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you up to the challenge, Evan? Yes. Yes, I am. You are? I am sensitive to spreading HankMed too thinly. No, no, we can handle it. We 're HankMed. Congratulations, then. Ev, I 'm really proud of you. Seriously, Boris is not an easy guy to impress. Thanks, Hank. It means a lot hearing you say that. Really. Whoever would have thought I 'd end up with Jill 's job? Just try not to fall for me, okay? - That would be really weird. - Okay, I 'll try. It 'll be hard. - Hey, can we, uh... - What? Have that chat now? Yeah, sure. Yeah, just step into my interim hospital administration office, which is probably, uh, where do you think that is? I think it 's that one. It 's nice. It 's right next to the corner suite. It 's locked. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner suite.( @upbeat_music)?? So...( @gentle_music)?? You know, I still ca n't figure out the meaning of a motorcade crashing into a basketball court. I just, I do n't... Mm, no, that one would stump even Freud. - Yeah. -( Chuckles) Seriously, I... I have cherished every single day we 've shared. Even that very rough week we spent in the hills overlooking Monaco. Yeah, we have survived a lot together. Yes, we have. Charlotte, I wanted to, um... Thank you. For opening me up to feelings I have n't had in a very long time. For... making me look forward to something beyond just the start of summer. And, well, I 'd like to make that feeling last. For good. Charlotte... will you marry me? Um... Hank... Oh. You did what? You think it was a bad idea? I think remaking The Karate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited 25 years. What you did was... crazy and impulsive. I misread her. I misread us, and I blew it. Well, for good? We had a brutally awkward ride to JFK. And when we said good-bye, I could just... I could just tell. This time, she is n't coming back. What makes you so sure? She said she 'd just gotten her vision back, she was traveling nonstop to expand her business, and, get this, we had n't been seeing each other that long anyway. She 'd been seeing you even less. - Sorry. - Everything felt so good, Ev. And... and somehow I just... I made it all go bad. Well, look on the bright side. You 've been consumed by this relationship, Henry. Like, consumed. Now you have time to catch up on all the things you 've been neglecting. - Yeah. - Yeah. Like what? Like... Me. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh, my God, that 's awesome, babe! " Mozel Tav "! Close enough. Not really. We can pick up the keys right now. The keys to our new house. Congrats, guys. Owning your first home together is a huge milestone. Would you give us one second? We were just having a conversation. No, it 's okay, Ev. I 'm good. We 'll talk later. Go pick up the keys. " Mozel Tav. " - Okay, come on. - All right.( @phone_vibrates) Hi, Ms. Newberg. My favorite first responders. So good to see you. Please.( Hank) : Thank you. Oh, what 's this?( Newberg) : The next episode of 52 Parties. - No way, I love that show. - How many what now? What show? What are we talking about? It 's... it 's a new reality show on Bravo. And a big, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. There 's Aubrey Wolfhouse. She 's the anti-Martha Stewart. It 's not about making it perfect. It 's about knowing it wo n't be.( Both) : The party must go on. -( Chuckles) - Okay. Well, how did you get her to film here? Well, let 's just say Andy Cohen owes me a favor. Aubrey is helping me throw a welcome party for my new neighbor, Muggsy. His name is Muggsy? Did he move here from the 1920s underworld? Apparently, he 's very sweet. That 's all I know. That and the fact that he gave me and Aubrey a great excuse for a party.( Becki) : Let 's go in tight on the trimming. Here comes our Emmy. What exactly is wrong with her? She looks pretty healthy to me. Well, I did n't call you about her. Oh, you look very healthy too, Ms. Newberg. I feel healthy. Vigorous, even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your dad upstate during his book tour. I have a feeling I 'm not gon na want to hear too much more about it. Our time together is so special. Exhausting, really, if you know what I mean. We do, we do. But when I got back home, I realized there was pink in my tink. Huh. Blood in your urine. Ahh. Yes, um, any pain? Well, I am a little sore. I was up there for three days, and nobody goes to Buffalo for the sightseeing, if you know what I... Yes, we know exactly what you mean. Ms. Newberg, it 's probably a bladder infection. We 'll get a urine sample and prescribe you some antibiotics.( Screams) And this is why you should wear gardening gloves when you do this. You pricked yourself with a thorn? I trimmed myself with the shears. Can we get a first aid kit outside? I can do you one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Um, I 'm a doctor. Can I take a look? Okay. Not too bad.( Paige) : Okay. Ahh. Okay, put me down, so I can go run around.( Squeals) Do you believe this place is actually ours? Uh, financially, the evidence is pretty convincing, so yeah. Babe, do n't rain on this. I 'm not, I 'm not... I 'm sorry, I am not. I... it is amazing. It 's truly amazing. - Is n't it perfect? - And it 's ours. - This is our house. - I know. - I mean, look at our floors. - Look at our fireplace! Look at... oh, my God, loot at our wet bar! Yeah, that wet bar is going straight to wet bar heaven. I thought I 'd slip that one through while you were excited. Aside from that, this place needs so little work. Can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such an unexpectedly pleasant mood? Unexpectedly? Hmm? You know, ' cause of the... ' cause of the, uh... time of the month? I actually have an app. What kind of app? It 's, you know, it 's just... just tracks your, uh, cycles. It does what? It 's called Red Dragon.( Chuckles) Evan, I just... realized I 'm late. You mean the dragon 's still in the castle? Yeah, and I 'm never late. You 're saying you could be... I mean, we could be... I do n't know. Probably not. I mean, we ca n't be. Technically, we could be. Right, but what I 'm saying is that we just ca n't be. Yeah, ' cause that would be crazy. Yeah. But I think we should go buy a pregnancy test just to be on the safe side. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. - Oh, right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can do that with your phone too. I think that would probably void the warranty.?? Are... are you sure you want this on camera? Mm-hmm. Oh, I have had a lot more mishaps than usual lately. Fortunately, it 's all very on-brand. - Huh? - Welcome to reality TV. Thanks for being game. Welcome to medicine in the Hamptons.( Laughs) You know, you are super telegenic with that killer smile and hair that could lift a car. Just curious, are you single? Uh, I do n't want to bore your viewers with my personal life. - Hmm. - So why 52 Parties?( Whispers) : I did have a much cooler name, but the network made me change it. No, I meant the number, not the name. Ah, well, hosting is nerve-racking. Even just a dinner party or having a few friends over for some binge watching... bringing people into your home, you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I never looked at it that way. Do you host a lot of parties? Do staff meetings count?( Laughs) So you plan all week, wanting everything to be perfect, but inevitably, something will go wrong, and some people hit those hurdles and they give up. They think they 're not cut out for it, but you got ta make the mistakes part of the fun. The party must go on. And you go right into the next party and then the one after that... And then 49 more. Have one very fun year. And one very clever TV show. Aw. Although I 'm not sure overcoming life 's hurdles is that easy. Well, about 1.2 million 18- to 49-year-olds want to believe that it is. All right, sounds like you got a hit on your hands. I was just as surprised as anyone. Of course, now the pressure is on to deliver big for season two. Huh. What? No, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more accidents than usual lately... the nerves. - Huh. - Look what I 've got. And there 's plenty more where this came from. Please tell me that 's not your sample. Oh, no, no. I 've got that. No, this is the greatest ros? in the world. Want some? No. Bye, Divs! Hank, thanks so much again for coming so quickly. My pleasure, every single time. Now, I 'm going to insist that you charge me this time, at least until your father makes an honest woman out of me, so we are officially family. Sorry, no deal. Well, then, you and Charlotte must come to my welcome party, so I can spoil you both with champagne, caviar, and a TV camera in your face. Uh, I do n't think that 'll be possible, but I 'll see if Divya 's available. She 's a big fan of Aubrey. What happened with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my share of breakups, and even though I stopped counting separations and divorces when I hit double digits, it did n't mean it stopped hurting. They always hurt. Every single time. So then... fess up. Things between Charlotte and me ended last night. - Ohh, Hank. - Oh, look! I have my next patient now, but thank you so much for your concern, Ms. Newberg. You are the best. You know what, let 's do another. Just to be sure, yeah? That was another. That was the third another. Evan, we 're sure. Hmm. Do n't you have a meeting at the hospital? Yeah, but I also... I also have this. And, obviously, this is big news. Big. But you still have your job. Your big, new, very important job. Right.( Sighs)( Exhales) We 're not ready, uh, at all. We are not ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have a car seat. We do n't have a crib. I do n't even know anything about any of that stuff. We 're gon na have to read a lot of books. And the house is n't ready. And what about you, should n't you be eating kale? Or vomiting or both? I 'm pregnant, not bulimic. Well... what do we do? Hey, I 'm freaking out too, believe me. Let 's at least try to freak out together, okay?( Sighs) I 'm gon na postpone my meeting, ' cause I can do that when I 'm the one in charge. I appreciate that. The good news is, we 've got nine months to adjust to this. So let 's just take some time to process it. Okay.( @knock_at_door) Yeah. So this is really your office? You find it lacking in some manner? No, no. Just does n't seem... Boris-y. I assume you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chuckles) I 'll admit it 's unconventional, but I know Evan will do a great job. No, I 'm here to follow up on your dizzy spell during the meeting. Yes, that would have been my next guess. Any other episodes lately? Perhaps one or two. Okay, I 'd like to do a neuro exam. I imagine you would. Wait. Ahh, now there 's the Boris I know and love. You may proceed. Okay. Um, follow my finger with your eyes. Good... stand with your feet together, eyes closed. Palms up. Okay, good. I want to remind you that your clinical trial is only designed... To stave off symptoms, yes. I recall all the tedious fine print, Hank. Okay, look straight ahead. The treatment only works if you 're rested and otherwise healthy. Now I know this acquisition of the hospital is a major undertaking... I am not overworking, Hank. You 're personally handling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit hands-on for you. Boris, is there more to this acquisition than you 're letting on? You must n't be so suspicious. Says the man with opaque windows. With Evan at the helm now, I can afford to step back, knowing that things will run smoothly. Are we done? Yeah. Sure. - Thank you. - Yep.? So hush, little baby, do n't you cry?? Daddy loves you?? And so do I?( Whispers) : I love you, Sashi. Did Nate take the twins to the park? He did. Is your next patient still at 2:30? Mm-hmm. So what you 're saying is, we have lunch hour all to ourselves again. No kids, no patients. Actual privacy. It seems I have my answer.?? Okay, well, the antibiotics may need more time to help, but I do n't see anything else more concerning. Well, at least I 'm not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ms. Newberg, I am fine, I promise. Oh, Hanky-poo... my brilliant, brilliant, poor boy. Okay. You can put on a brave face, but I know you. You are too sensitive to be so fine so soon. It 's okay to be hurting. Luckily, I can distract myself with work, like this exam, which would be a lot easier if you would just relax and stop trying to console me, Ms. Newberg. Denial is not your friend, Hank. You have to wallow. Wallowing is a must. You can not just doctor your way around the wallow. Try it. What did you find in the ultrasound? The ultrasound 's clean. I 'm sad for Hank, not me. - Why for Hank? - Ms. Newberg, please. Because Charlotte broke his heart. Tell her, Hank. I realized what was missing from our signature cocktail... ginger. Wait till you taste it now, Ms. Newberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink? Beets and gin. Simple and sublime. Ms. Newberg, have you been tasting many of those? Beets are so healthy, and they make the cocktail so colorful. Yeah, they make other things colorful too. Ms. Newberg, I think we 've diagnosed your ailment. The pink in your tink is from your drink. Huh. Do we need to send you to penmanship camp? My handwriting 's still not big enough? It 's actually worse than before. How can your handwriting be getting smaller and smaller? It ca n't. That 's impossible. Aubrey, have you had any other recent injuries? Just the usual cuts and scrapes. Comes with the territory. You did mention that you 've been clumsier than usual lately. I have had a few more accidents. Aubrey, when you cut yourself earlier, do you think it was because your hand was shaking? I 'm not sure. Well, there 's an easy way to find out. Oh, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and focus in on that hand? You got it.( Divya) : Look, her fingers. - Pill-rolling tremor. - Mm-hmm. What does that mean? Maybe nothing, but we should do a couple of tests just to make sure. So I was thinking either, A, there 's electric... Hello, Ms. Lawson. Hi. Uh, I 'm just about to step into a meeting. What 's going on? Um, the news we got this morning? Yeah? It 's not news anymore. Meaning it 's old news now, or it was inaccurately news, or... Evan, this would be where you tell me you need a moment with your wife. - Thank you, Boris. - Right, yeah, I... Think I... yeah. I 'll just... I 'll meet you in there. I got my period. False alarm. Do you feel okay? Yeah, I 'm gon na make an appointment with the ob-gyn just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) Wow, um, what a relief, right? Oh, totally. Yeah, I-I freaked out all morning. I poured cream over my pancakes in the staff lounge.?? Um, I really have to go do this meeting right now. Yeah, yeah, we 'll still catch up tonight. I just thought maybe you 'd like to have the news right away. - I love you. - I love you. - Okay, I 'll see you tonight. - Okay. Bye. Uh, okay, um, I 'll send this to radiology to rule out any thromboembolic events or hydrocephalus, but your CT looks normal. That 's a relief. I 'll also draw blood to rule out vitamin deficiencies or any infection that could explain your tremors. Okay. Is that it? For now, yeah, but we 'll have to take this one step at a time. Okay. Uh, by the way, since it seems like we 'll be getting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should know that I was n't flirting with you earlier. Oh, that 's okay. I was feeling you out for Becki. - Becki? - Mm-hmm. Your producer, Becki? She thinks you 're hot. In case you did n't notice her checking you out. Yeah, no, I-I did n't notice that. You should get in there, Hank. She 's a lot of fun, she has a place out here, and she 's weirdly down to earth for someone who works in TV. Uh, listen, that 's flattering. It 's just really bad timing for me. Totally get it. I am sorry for overstepping. No, not at all. And, look, I appreciate that your " get right back on the horse " philosophy is n't limited to hosting parties. I just... I need a little more time. Of course, whatever works for you. Thank you. Oh, but I did already send you her number, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( Laughs) Huh, ' kay.?? - Hey. - Hey. Thinking about Charlotte?( Sighs) - Actually, no. - It 's okay. If... if you do n't want to talk about it, I-I totally understand. And if you do n't feel like partying either, I could check up on Aubrey. We ca n't do anything anyway until her blood work comes back. Aubrey 's blood work is back. It did n't pick up anything. It 's very unusual in someone your age, and it 's a diagnosis of exclusion. That means we arrive at it by eliminating all other possible causes. Okay. But given your test results and the distinctive tremor in your hand, Aubrey, it seems likely that you 're in the early stages of Parkinson 's disease. What? I do n't un...( Solemnmusic)?? Hello from the Hamptons, and welcome to another episode of 52 Parties, guest starring me. Aubrey helped me plan this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome party 's being filmed? Well, technically, dear, it 's my welcome party. Are you nervous? Have you never performed on TV before? Well, actually, I played 14 years in the NBA. Ohh, you 're sweet and funny! Well, you will be a very welcome edition to the neighborhood, Muggsy. Well, thank you. Oh, hi. Good to see you.( Both) : Hey. - Any luck? - No, but her car is in the driveway. Okay, I 'll check with Newberg again. Okay, good.( Popmusic)?? Hey, Hank. Have you seen Aubrey? I was just gon na ask you the same thing. Any idea where she could be? No. She likes to run around trying to find new blooper possibilities. Speaking of, I know Aubrey gave you my number, but I just want to say there 's totally no pressure. Oh, okay, thank you. Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I literally just got out of a... Oh. There 's Aubrey. Um, how about I talk to her, then you talk to her? Then you and I finish talking to each other? - Sounds good. - I 'll see you later.?? Hey. You must be feeling pretty overwhelmed right now. I am. That 's completely normal. Anything I can help clarify? To be honest, I did n't hear much after the word " Parkinson 's. " And that 's normal too. So how about we start from scratch? I 'd appreciate that. Okay. Parkinson 's is a progressive disorder of the nervous system that affects your movement. And there is no cure?( Softmusic) Not yet. Not yet. But there are medications that can help manage the symptoms, and new treatments are being made available as we speak. Like what? Like deep brain stimulation, stem cell therapy, clinical trials. I 'm not sure why I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means anyways. Listen, I 'll find you a great specialist and help in any other way I can. We 'll navigate this together. It just sucks that I have to quit the show. I barely started it. You do n't have to quit. We do n't know how your symptoms will progress. Maybe you could just take it one party at a time. I do n't think America wants to watch me shaking and trembling. It 's not why they tune into my show. Overcoming obstacles with a positive attitude. That 's why America tunes into your show. Right? Yeah.( Popmusic)?? I have to say, that Aubrey is pretty impressive. - Inspiring, even. - No question. And it looks like your pep talk got her back on her feet again. I think she would have gotten there on her own. That determination is just part of who she is. And she reminded me that it 's a part of who I am too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, exactly? I really thought Charlotte and I were ready to move forward, and when I found out she disagreed, I was crushed. But I realize now, she was right. Charlotte was n't the right person for me, because we were in such completely different places in our lives. She was discovering the world all over again, and I was ready to be in love, you know, ready to settle down. So I jumped in, both feet, with the first person I really liked. Sounds like you felt your biological clock ticking. And that is definitely not the right way to find the right person. But Charlotte helped me realize that I 'm ready to find that right person, whoever she is. I mean, the party must go on, right? Does this mean you 'll be going on 52 dates then?( Sighs) - If that 's what it takes. - Hmm.( @glasses_clinking)?? We 're christening the chimney now? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And why wait till the next polar vortex to find out it does n't work, right? What 's wrong?( Sighs) To be honest, um... I 'm having mixed feelings about our false alarm. I mean, I think about what we could be celebrating right now and... And you feel disappointed? Yeah. Does n't sound so mixed. And to be honest, I 've been having similar not-so-mixed feelings. Like when I went into the hospital for that meeting, I... I could n't concentrate on anything, I was just... I was flat-out sad.( Chuckles) So are you saying... I mean, I 'm... I did n't even know it until... until we were having one and then we were n't, but... I want a baby. I want a baby too. I really want a baby. Okay, do n't get competitive.( Laughs)( Laughing) : Oh, my God. So what do you say we take this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it even more perfect? Oh, I am totally down for that. And then this place will be heaven.( Thud) What the hell was that? Mm, okay, do n't freak out, but that was a snake. What? No.( Screams) - Hey, hey! - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I thought we agreed you were n't gon na freak out. You were calmer when you thought I was pregnant. Why is there a snake in our house? Um, I do n't know. Probably when you started the fire, he was like, uh, there 's a fire in here, I 'm out. Can you stop being such a sympathizer, please? This is a home invasion. There 's a snake in our house! On the count of three, we 're gon na walk calmly upstairs and call for help. - Okay. - Ready? One...( Whimpers) Two, three. All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I 'm out... hey, what 's going on? We 're so sorry to intrude, but could we spend the night? We 're having a problem at our new place. Uh, yeah, I guess you can. What kind of problem? Multiple problems. Long, slimy, slithering problems, falling from our chimney... our chimney, Henry. Nothing is sacred to these demons. Oh, are you expecting company? Uh, I am, actually. Yeah, I am expecting company. Oh. Wha... already? Is n't rushing into things what got you into this situation in the first place? I 'm not rushing into anything. It 's dinner, that 's it. I 'm having dinner tonight anyway. Why not have it with company instead of alone? I 'm moving forward at some point. Why not start right now? - Just do n't... - Do n't worry. I wo n't propose.??( Bicyclebellrings) So are the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their grandparents. As am I. Can you believe I slept till 7:00 a.m. today?( Laughs) : Well, enjoy every second of it. I hope you have good news by the time I return. Yeah, I 'm at my lawyer 's office now to drop off the custody agreements. Good luck. Talk to you later. Okay, bye. Be right back, Bunny.( Grunts) Hey, Sashi. Somebody needs Mama 's help. I 'll be right back, okay? I love you.( Caralertchirps)( Groans) Sir, I 'm a physician assistant. I 'm gon na take a look at your head wound, okay?( Choking) Okay, you 're choking on something, and I 'm gon na get it out. Come on. I 'll need to dislodge it manually.( @dramatic_music)?? Bubble gum.( Gasps, coughs) Sir? Sir, can you tell me your name? - Joey. - Joey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumped your head pretty hard. You 'll need a work-up at the hospital to check for a concussion or any other head injuries. Yes, hi, this is Divya Katdare. I am outside South Fork Historical Society. I 'm with a male in respiratory distress. I need an ambulance straightaway. Thank you. I 'll be right back. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me, what... Hey, what are you guys doing? That is my daughter. Then you must be the one who endangered her health and broke the law by leaving her unattended in your vehicle. What? No. I 'm gon na need to see some ID. - Okay. Okay. -( Sashicrying) Ugh, look. I... I 'm a physician assistant, and I was responding to an emergency right over there... Damn it, I told him to stay there. He... Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wait, you can not just take my child. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to take this up with Child Protective Services. Child Protect... what? Hey, hey, just get your... get your hands off me! Ma'am. Sashi, honey, Mama 's right here. - You 're under arrest. - What? -( @baby_cries) - Sashi, Mommy 's right here. Do n't worry, honey, I 'm right here.( @dramatic_music)??
