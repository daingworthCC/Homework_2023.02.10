5216241 Poppy! Come on, let 's get going. Where are you? Oh, for heaven 's sakes. Poppy, get dressed. Zeb will be here any minute. Oh. What 's all that for? The picnic for Nono and Barry - - their engagement. You have known about this for weeks. Well, I ca n't remember every wingding you... you got going around here. It is n't a wingding. It 's for Nono. You 're going to have lots of fun today, Peter. You know, my family throws parties for a living. My stepmother - - your soon-to-be step-grandmother - - well, nobody throws a party like Beck.( @phone_rings) Open Arms - - for all of... Oh, Zeb, where are you? Sorry. I had an emergency. I 'm going to be a little late. Want me to meet you at the park? All right. I 'll wrangle up Poppy. See you there. Oh. Come on. Help me get this stuff in the car. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy. Oh, yeah? Too heavy? Well, uh, I can make it. Oh, good. I 'll get the door. Ah. You all right?( glassclinking) Oh, Poppy, careful. There 's crystal in there. Crystal? At a picnic? Well, what better occasion than for my nearest and dearest? Oh. Well, how can you have a picnic without food? Biddy 's making the food. As always. Oh. Mmm - - snails in phyllo dough. Mom, ca n't we ever have hamburgers and hot dogs like normal people? Which? Uh, sneakers. Beck says she wants to organize a family baseball game. Oh, there it is. Ow! Oh!( chuckling)( @horn_honks) Hey. Come on, I 'm starving. All right, all right.( chuckling) Is there any food in there? No. It 's for the champagne. Oh. I hope Patch remembered the bats and balls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody was supposed to be here by 3:30. Uh... Well, I guess we 'll go for a jog then. Oh, go ahead - - just run away. Just like every other family gathering. Poppy, those are for Min Foo. Oh. Is she going to eat the whole jar?( chuckling) Well, when I was pregnant with Min Foo, I used to crave dills all the time. Mmm.( slurping) Oh, Poppy! Love it! Oh, I want more.( chuckling) Hey, Min Foo, I came... So, where is my mother? Oh, there she is. Oh. Let me get your bag. I 'm fine. I 'm fine. Hi! Hi. Hi. Oh, see? She does n't want to be here either. I do n't know why we have to celebrate Nono 's engagement to that... that corporate lawyer. Because she 's your sister. Oh, come on. Help me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here they are. Hi, Barry. Oh. Hi, sweetheart. Hi. And you have got to be Peter. I 'm Rebecca. Hey, you want to come with me and meet your new cousins? No. Oh, come on. Okay, a toast, everybody, a toast. To all of us gathered together in this glorious spring weather. Here she goes. To Zeb for scoping out the site. Cheers. Thank you very much. To Biddy, for cooking with all of her might, and Troy for helping her get it right. Um, to Patch and Jeep for suggesting the bats and the balls, even though we never use them at all. To Hakim and Min Foo. In August, they 're due. But most of all, to Nono and Barry. Oh. We are so delighted that they are going to marry.( laughter) Oh, and last but not least, a toast to Peter. Someone new in our family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To Peter. I 'm not in your family. Oh. Better go get him before he jumps in the river. BARRY : Peter, get back here right now!( peoplemurmuring) Peter, come on! REBECCA : Did you ever have the feeling you turned into the wrong person? ZEB : Mmm... well, no. I mean look at me - - after 20 years, still a widow planning other people 's parties. Do n't read no more, discuss important issues, do n't got no friends. You 've got friends. You got the girls. You 've got me. Yeah, relatives. And everybody else I know is some kind of repairman. Relatives can be friends. Repairmen, I 'm not so sure about. Listen, I 'm serious, Zeb. What, what happened to the friends I knew in college or in high school? I mean, for instance, Amy Darrow, the girl who had her engagement party the day I met Joe right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her wedding. Of course, I was married myself by then, and all three girls had chicken pox, but still. Okay, okay, to be continued. I 'm gon na make rounds at the hospital tomorrow. Okay. ' Night. ' Night.( **25;4061;TOOLONG)( @bell_clanging) REBECCA : I had the oddest dream last night. Were there any numbers in it? What? If you can recall any numbers, my friend Al is always after me for numbers to play the lottery with. He wants the numbers from my dreams, but I do n't have any dreams anymore. No, this was a, this was a dream about a boy. And he seemed to be... my son. I was on a train, and I could n't quite see his face, but... it seems that he was very handsome... and confident. Do you recall what number train it was? No. And I do n't know where we were going either.( chuckling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was lacking in plot. In fact, it 's sort of uninteresting. So, I 'd like to switch the subject to my birthday. Your birthday 's not till December, Poppy. December 11th. I 'm going to be100years old. Well, I know that, Poppy. I suppose you 're planning some big wingding for me. I mean, I mean bigger than usual, huh? Well, we 'll see. Maybe.( @phone_rings)( chuckles) : Yes. But it 's still pretty far away. And when we get a little closer... Open Arms - - for all of life 's occasions. Oh, yes, hi, Melinda. Here 's a list. The guest list for my birthday party. REBECCA : Oh, certainly. Oh, he... yeah, he 's a very good DJ. Yup, he brings his own sound system. Oh, I 'm sure he can play whatever anyone would like. Mom, it 's me! Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foo. If you dreamed you had a son and not daughters, and the boy was blonde and not dark, then you might have been dreaming how your life could be if you had chosen a different fork in the road -- if you 'd decided on some different kind of life. Or, it probably means my baby 's going to be a boy. No, Min Foo, this is not about you. And besides, he did n't have your coloring. He was blonde. I could have a blonde baby. Half my genes are yours, remember? Well, yeah, maybe with Joey 's father. But I seriously doubt that you could hope to have blonde genes with Hakim. I know where this is going. Before we start talking about my choices in husbands, I have an obstetrician to see. Oh, honey, come on. I was n't implying anything about your various husbands. Yeah, right. I got to go. Bye, guys. Bye, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. This is a graduation party. Those are wedding bells. Aw. Hey, why do n't we pretend they 're school bells? Yay! Okay. Let 's just make sure they all work. Ooh, pretty. Nice. Yeah. You know that these were strung across the room the first time I ever came here?? Hey, little woman, please make up your mind?? You 've got to come into my world?? And leave your world behind?? Come on, now?? Na-na-na-na-na-na...?( laughing) MAN : I see you 're having a wonderful time. Hi. I 'm Joe Davich. That guy you 're laughing at, that 's, uh, my kid brother, Zeb. I 'm Rebecca Holmes. I 'm Amy 's roommate. Are you a friend of Artie 's? Oh, no, no, my family owns this place. Oh. Can I get you some champagne? Oh. no, thank you, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find you some ginger ale, then. Oh! I am so sorry. Come in the kitchen with me. Joe, get the ham. Wish I would have known you were coming. Joe so seldom brings his dates home. I 'm not his... Of course, you know Joe 's children. Children? This is Nono and Patch and Biddy. And you 've probably heard the story. Their mother Tina escapes to New York City and dumps the whole crew on me. Mommy 's going to be a famous nightclub singer. So some would have us believe. Here, Mother. A little soap and water, and no one will ever know. Right. Let 's clean off those shoes, huh? Okay. Mommy has this beautiful dress where the straps are made of diamonds. Really? There. Good as new. Thanks. Come on. MOTHER : Where are you taking her? Do n't worry, we 'll see her again. Okay, guys. Oh, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raisins. Uh... we will be seeing you, wo n't we? I 'm gon na have love at first sight, too. Oh, I hope you do, dear. We finished just a few hours ago. Well... Is n't that lovely? Oh, yeah. Here 's the problem. Katie did n't graduate. She did n't graduate? No. I was laying out her clothes this morning and suddenly Katie turned to me and she said, " Oh, did I mention I flunked chemistry? " At the time, I failed to understand that flunking chemistry would keep her from graduating, but it-it did and... Well, listen. Is n't it fortunate that you already planned this party? It sends such a message. A message? Yeah, a message - - that you love and you support your daughter in spite of her failure. Oh. But my friends. How will I face them? Oh, did-did you read that report a few years ago? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually discovered that if you fake a smile that your, uh, smile muscles, they just somehow trigger a signal to your brain, and you start to feel the way you pretended to feel. Yeah, really. Happy.( chuckles) Well, I suppose it is kind of difficult to cancel at this late date. But I-I-I thought maybe... You know, Katie 's such a lucky girl. ZEB : Nice save, Beck. How do you manage to pull these things off? Well, it 's not like I ever had a choice. What is that supposed to mean? Oh, never mind. You know, maybe I should get myself a dog. I mean, if I had a dog to walk, it would be easier to meet people, right? Maybe you should just get away from the Open Arms for a while. Go somewhere, visit someone. Yeah, well that 's my point. Who would I visit? Surely you can think of someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing in the morning. But you just got here. Yeah, but I have a big anniversary party at the Open Arms. Oh, that place. Oh, darling, no. That place is how I make my money. What little there is of it. That 's the Daviches ' business. No, actually it 's mine. And there 's Poppy to think about. Oh, that old man. Is he still alive? Yes, he 's still alive. Exactly how are you related? He 's Joe 's father 's twin brother. You know that, Mother. Darling. You could have done so much better. Like how? Oh, you were such a brilliant student, Rebecca. Do you remember that paper on Robert E. Lee? Did n't the professor say that you could expand it into an honors project? Well, he suggested that I... And before you got started, bang, here comes Joe Davich and puts you to work. Mother... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit him. One day you were as good as engaged, and the next you up and married a man that nobody knew from Adam. I made a choice. Well, it was the wrong choice. You and Will Allenby were soul mates. You 've been a different woman ever since you jilted Will.( @bell_tolling) POPPY : Rebecca! Where were you?( @phone_ringing) You knew where I was, Poppy. I was at my mother 's. Oh, is she still alive? Is that Biddy? It 's not like I was n't gon na tell you. Why does n't anybody answer this? Hello? Uh, uh, Open Arms, for all of life 's occasions. You 've always hated my cooking. Yeah? That 's not true. Tomorrow night at 8:00. Besides, we just want you That 's right to be able to enjoy the wedding. All right, well, we 'll be very happy to see you then. Oh, please. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh, she 's mad because I do n't want her to do the food. Barry and I just want a more straightforward menu. And besides, Biddy 's never done a garden wedding before. Who 's having a garden wedding? We are. Here. Mother suggested it. I think it 's a great idea. Oh, Tina suggested it. Oh, is Tina doing the landscaping? Of course not - - Mother does n't arrive until two days before the wedding. Aha. I see. We can do it, Beck. I am a florist, after all.( @horn_honks)( cardoorsslam)( **26;4088;TOOLONG) Mother 's here!( alltalkingatonce) Oh, Rachel. Dear! Rebecca. Mother brought us gifts from London. Oh. Nice. Oh, Mother, please. Oh, Mother, I love them. For your chignon. Oh. Oh, thank you so much. It 's about 1812. All that tea with this instant family. Mother, this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found it in Capri. Mother, I love it. Min Foo, she 's not your mother. Oh, I-I just... Oh, Minerva, I 've always thought of you as my fourth daughter, have n't I? Rebecca, come, come, come. You have n't opened your present yet. Oh. Okay. Oh. An apron. I thought something useful. Thank you. Now, Barry, tell me all about the wedding plans. Well, we finally found a minister. Nono and I were at a restaurant the other night Mm-hmm. wondering who we could get to marry us, and our waitress said, " Well, I can do that. " So, what 'll it be? Do you, like, take this woman here to be your lawfully wedded wife? Oh, you 're joking. Turns out she has some kind of certificate she sent away for through the mail. You did n't tell me this. It 's... Perfectly legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Oh, well. Why not? It 's all a big charade, anyhow, I mean, my singing teacher was devastated when I married Joe, I mean, " My dear, you are throwing away a God-given talent. " I mean, marriage may be useful during those little child-bearing years, but, all that, " My darling, are n't you amazing? " gives away to blood pressure monitoring and hand holding when the man retires and he ca n't think what to do with themselves. And the wives, meanwhile, start longing to get free from this institution invented by males for their own benefit. It 's all a primitive tribal ritual, meant to make us forget we 're merely propagating the species.( manclearingthroat) She certainly knows the right thing to say to a bride and groom.( @phone_dialing) Oh, hello. Is this Alumni Records? This is Rebecca Holmes Davich. I 'm looking for a, um, an address of a classmate, Allenby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He teaches there? Ah. Okay. Oh, good. All right. Thanks very much. Okay, bye-bye.( sighs) I ca n't believe Uncle Poppy 's still here. He was always such a bore. I mean, all the Daviches, a bunch of mopers. How ironic their profession was throwing parties. I mean, just because your house has 14 foot ceilings does n't automatically turn you into a social butterfly. I do n't know how you 've managed all these years. I just put one foot in front of the other. You do n't have any, shall we say, man friends, I suppose. No. Well, of course not. After baby-sitting Joe Davich, why would you want one? Yes, why would I? Oh. Ah. This place is like a time machine. Same old sink. Same sticky wooden cabinets. Same scummy little drinking glasses. Same rusty screen door. Why, how American. Instant lawn! I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks a lot. Been working out every day.

The uniting of two people in marriage. Nono and Barry come before us here today to... be united in marriage. Theirs is a love that springs from the affection of those who loved them into being. And to that source, let us all turn and ask, who gives this woman? Oh. Me.( chuckles) London, well... Our mother 's actually flirting with her new son-in-law. Nono 's about to kill her. She was telling Barry they ought to take Peter on their honeymoon. Every time, you girls ca n't wait for your mother to get here. Now you ca n't wait for her to leave. Oh, I told Nono that Peter could stay here. Is that cake a little slanted? What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, what do you expect? First Nono does n't even want me to cater the wedding, then she does.

Well, I do n't feel that cakes are Biddy 's strong point, so I 'd like you to find somebody else to make my birthday cake. I 'll be 100 years old.( chuckling) : December 11. Mm... Taking that to your room, huh? Yeah, I think I will. Hey, how about you and I go out for some ice cream, huh? Get some fresh air? No thanks. How ' bout a game?

Oh, gosh, I, you know, I just h-happened to be home -- I mean, at... at Mom 's, and-and she and I just got talking about old times, and I thought to myself, " Gee, wonder whatever happened to...

Oh, no, I-I could n't do that, ' cause I 've got a tea dance, and then... Oh, boy. This weekend, I got a funeral, and I got, uh, an engagement party, but, um...

It seems so long ago, does n't it? You broke my heart, Rebecca. I mean, no warning. I mean, I thought everything was fine, and then, you just said good-bye without a reason why.

Oh, they 're putting in some azaleas. Oh.( @phone_rings) This is like running a plantation. The, uh, divorce was Laura 's idea. One day, she just announced that she wanted me to move out. Of course, she kept our daughter. Laura 's always had a better understanding of Beatrice. It 's only natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I. Not like you. Excuse me? I, I mean you were always so mature for your age, so involved with your studies, so... serious. I always regret that I did n't finish my education. Mmm. Do you remember this new theory that I had of, of why Robert E. Lee decided to cast his lot with the South? Lee? Mmm. Maybe I should finish that research. Th-there are other things you can do, too, uh... Museums could be particularly edifying. Gosh, I ca n't remember the last time I was in a museum. Perhaps we could go together. I 'm going down to Washington on Friday. Maybe you could join me. Wonderful museums there. Oh, I 'd love to do that, Will.( @phone_rings) Friday, then. Good. Your phone sure does ring a lot. Can we go in the other room? Rebecca... It 's occurred to me that this was very providential. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had just hit rock bottom. I mean, it 's so incredibly providential that you called me when you did, Rebecca. In the old days, ice cream places offered unlimited samples. Egg nog, pistachio, rum raisin - - any flavor. Well, hi. What are you doing here? We stopped for ice cream, but Poppy was so displeased with the service, he said he 'd just as soon have his dessert at home. Hi, I 'm, I 'm Will Allenby. Hi, I 'm Zeb, Rebecca 's brother-in-law. This is my uncle, Paul Davich. Sorry to barge in like this. I thought you were going to the movies. After that smart aleck in the, in the ice cream parlor, I, I did n't have the heart for it. Wh-What 's for dessert? Well, I remembered that Will did n't care for sweets, so I did n't make a dessert. POPPY : Oh. Well, I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in high school. " Our Rebecca "? Well, actually, um... kindergarten. Beck! Are you home?( sighing) He-here. Where have you been?

Go ahead, Peter, tell Rebecca what you wanted to ask her. What, honey? Um... at my school, they have this exhibit of these projects. And they have us invite our grandparents. It 's on Friday. Is it this Friday? Uh-huh. And, I know you 're not really my grandma, but since my dad 's parents are dead, I was wondering if... I 'd be honored to. Ice cream - - who wants ice cream? Super Chunky Chango ice cream.( laughter) I 'm so sorry about Friday, but, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappoint him. No, of course not. The museums will always be there. Yeah.

Well, how did a bee get in here? It 'll be okay. Let 's just go to the hospital. I 'll get some ice. I 've got Abdul. Dixon, you and Emmy take Lateesha to the backyard. Wait, I 'm coming. I 've got the ice. Beck? Oh, Poppy, please, not now. Beck, I... I do n't feel so good. Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's allergic to, uh, to penicillin and tomatoes. Is this a heart attack?

How are we doing? Well, he 's not feeling so... Zeb... they 're trying to finish me off. Nope, they 're letting you go. Turns out it was indigestion.( chuckling) : Oh. Indigestion? I spoke with the resident. He said you had three cupcakes at the baby welcoming. Well, what if I did? I 've eaten far more many a time. We should let them know at home. Poppy... They must be pretty worried. Yeah. Did Joey get his shot? He 's already back at the party, making up for lost time. I 'll go call. Oh, God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Yeah, well, I do n't know what the world is coming to if a man ca n't eat three measly cupcakes without folks calling an ambulance.( laughter) REBECCA : Oh, I forgot the dessert. You do like dessert, now, do n't you, monsieur? Whoa.( laughing) Thank you. How 's your father-in-law? My father-in-law? Mm-hmm. Oh, you mean Poppy. Uh, he 's not my father-in-law. He 's Joe 's uncle. Want this one? And you still live with him, even though you 're barely related. Well, I sort of inherited him. He came with the house.( chuckles) For a while I resented having to take care of him, but when I thought he might die, I... I realized how much he means to me. Do n't mind my asking, but... how come after your husband died you never remarried? I do n't know. I, I think what you look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was young, I wanted somebody " other. " The most wildly other person. Not... well, that 's why I was drawn to Joe, I guess. But now I just, uh, think the idea of being with somebody different would just... be exhausting. Well, look at you and me. We 're totally different, Rebecca. We are? Oh, well it might seem so now, but... well, I think of the old days, the things that interested us... well, I think, yeah, that was back... that was back when we were grownups. ' Course, you still are a grownup, but me, I... I feel like I 've been traveling in reverse.( chuckling) WILL : Robert E. Lee. Boy, things sure have changed since we were at MacAdam, huh? WILL : Go. REBECCA : Oh, wow! This was such a good idea, Will. Well, you said you wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Uh-huh. This one might be good. On special order. Oh, dear. No, no, it 's all right. Hmm? Wo n't take long? Uh-uh. No problem. Okay. Come on.( beeping) We 'll call you when it comes in. Great, thanks ; you 're done. Let me grab these. I 'll take some of those. No, no, no ; here we go.

Oh, my gosh.( laughing)( gaspingandchuckling) This is wonderful! I do n't know how you did this. What do... what do your teachers say? I think they kind of liked it. Oh, I bet they do. Is there a motor?( chuckling) : That 's a secret. Oh. Oh, then do n't tell me. Do n't tell me. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see the other projects? No. No, I... I just want to stay here and admire this one. Oh, no, no. That boy is brilliant. Yes. Everybody keeps telling me how bright he is. I just... I wish he could drive. Honey, did you see his project? I do n't know if it was music or art or science, but it is astounding. I was the one who had to ferry him to the back of beyond for supplies. Barry was away attending a conference, would n't you know? I know it 's hard. But I so wish that you could enjoy this boy, because he is going to be grown and gone in a flash. Easy for you to say. You do n't have the slightest idea what it 's like being saddled with somebody else 's kid when you 're still practically on your honeymoon. GIRL : No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought maybe you 'd like to meet my daughter. Oh, Will, I would love to meet your daughter. Oh, mm. Something I can bring? No, just yourself. What shall I wear? Anything... or-or maybe... no... just anything. No, Will, you can tell me. I mean, is there something special you want me to wear or not wear? Well, I... I-I-I do n't know, um...( clearsthroat) Maybe... something not too... hippie. Hippie? Well, it's-it 's just that some of your clothes tend to be a bit... exotic. Oh.

I used chicken stock, but do n't say a word. Oh. My lips are sealed. Hi, Beatrice. Hello, Beatrice. So, you told me to come here at 6:00. Here I am. Well, thank you, Bea. I 'm very glad you came. Are we eating supper or not? Oh, oh, do n't you want to sit around a while and talk? I... Talk? About what? And who is this lady, anyhow? Oh. I 'm, um...

I 'm here because he promised me my own cell phone if I came. Oh. Okay, we 've met. Can I go now? You-you-you have n't eaten. All right, if you insist, let 's eat. Oh.( clearsthroat) This is a complete, in one dish, whole grain meal. Oh. Entirely vegetarian. Actually, I eat meat now. You do? Well, we can all stand to eat some grain from time to time. Beatrice, pass me your plate. I 'm afraid I 'm not much of a chef. Oh, I think you were wonderful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoffs) So... do many men have you to supper, Rebecca? Oh. Well, I do n't... No. ' Cause, actually, you seem pretty normal on the surface. I 'm just wondering if you realize what kind of guy you 're eating with, here. Uh, he 's a pretty nice guy. The guy who kidnapped our dog when Mom asked him for a divorce. Your dog? Our little dog, Flopsie. I did not kidnap Flopsie Doodle. I borrowed her. He stole her while we were out, and we came home, and we called, " Flopsie. " No Flopsie. So my mom phoned my dad. We knew it was him. And she said that she was calling the police. Do you know what he did? He lied, and he said, oh, he had no idea what she was talking about. Then he opened up his door and let Flopsie run out all by herself, when everybody knows what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky she was n't killed. I was feeling sad, okay? I was having a difficult time. Like it was n't difficult for Mom and me? I went looking for her in the rainstorm. I was out half the night, and when I found her, all covered with mud, I-I put her in my brand-new car, and I brought her home. How many times can I apologize? Well, just so you know, you 're boyfriend 's a total perv. You 're getting me a cell phone tomorrow.( @door_opens)( @door_slams) Well, I guess this was n't very successful. Oh, well, it 's... You know what? Now that I 've met your family, I want you to meet mine. I mean, I already... Well, three or four you bumped into, but I... but I mean a proper dinner party with everybody there. Okay? That 'd be great. Good. Oh... Gracious.( chuckles) Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks very much. If I 'd known that Beatrice was back eating meat, I would have served my chili. Hmm. Mm-hmm. All right. Bye-bye. Bye. Hmm.( @crickets_chirping) ZEB : He kidnapped their dog? REBECCA : Oh, yeah. Oh, boy. Well, in a way, I think he 's still, um, in mourning for his marriage. You know, he 's been going through a really difficult time. He 's kind of an odd guy, and I just thought a party where he could meet all of you would... Rebecca, I 've met Will on a couple of occasions. Yeah, I know, but I-I 'd like him to meet everybody, all together, you know - - a more formal atmosphere. Formal? Yeah, just not some typical Davich free-for-all potluck where Will could be overwhelmed, but something... sedate and organized. You know, everybody arriving at a pre-arranged time, talking about civilized topics, you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grown-up affair. I want you to meet the man in my life. You have a man in your life? You never told me that. Oh, you know Will has been coming around now and then. I thought he was just a friend.( @baby_cooing) Why are you springing this on me now? I am not springing anything on you. This is not about you. Saturday night? You 're never free on Saturdays. Is the Open Arms going under? No more than usual. Well, have n't I already met this person? Yes, but-but I want this to be a more official introduction to the family as a whole. Okay, look, whatever. I 'm running late, okay? Okay. Bye.( @phone_rings)( sighs) Open Arms. How come you invited Min Foo to dinner and not me? Patch, I was just going to... Is this because she 's your real daughter? I hate you. You 're not my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sakes, I 'm inviting all of you. Oh, Beck, this is so exciting. A man in your life. I am making something fabulous. What is that you 're wearing? Oh, just something different than my usual hippie dippie color crazy thing, you know? Call it flight attendant casual.( laughs)( @doorbell_rings) Well, fasten your seat belts, me merry crew. Hi, Will. Am I late or early or... okay? Oh, you 're... you 're right on time. Come on. Okay. Yeah. WILL : Thanks. I trust you have nothing against hearts of palm. That what that is? I thought it 'd be a nice... symbolic touch. Hearts, romance, you know? Hmm. Palm trees are cut up for that?( grunts) Broccoli plants are cut up. Asparagus shoots are cut up. Do n't tell me you 're one of those food avoiders. No, no, no, I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an experiment. Hearts of palm is just a salad. So, you and Rebecca have-have known each other since you were kids? 50 years. Oh! Can I really have been alive that long? And now you 're reunited. That 's, uh... Must be complicated, though, living in separate towns. WILL : Oh, that 's exactly it. My odometer 's taken a huge leap, and my engine 's developed a cough, uh... Oh, well, you-you should give J.J. a call. WILL : J.J.? Yeah, J.J. does a lot of, uh, odd jobs around here, but, oh, he is a gifted mechanic. He 's the only one that can coax my Chevy along. J.J.

Look, see, um, they had, uh, themselves made up to look like Bonnie and Clyde, and then they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanic? Mm. Well, lately, though, Tanya 's had to increase her medication. Poor thing, you know, she 's just given to these sort of demented delusions, and, uh, oh, gosh, one day, she was walking across somebody 's front porch ; she was wildly flinging a-a souvenir Japanese sword. Ay-yi-yi. And, uh... J.J. said that that 's not the real true Tanya. He just still thinks that his wife is... amazing. That 's the man that repairs your cars.( door_opening) Oh. Hello.

It 's like... I 'm so useful. Well, do n't you think that all of us, I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their usefulness? Beck, love has nothing to do with it. There 's no use. Hakim is hopeless. Thanks. I can always rely on my family for emotional support. Oh, Min Foo... please, could you please just once try to resist dumping a husband once you 've had his baby? I gave you the name of Patch 's marriage counselor. Patch, you 're going to a marriage counselor? Thanks a lot, Biddy. Why does everybody in this family seem so unhappy? Thank goodness for you and Troy. Troy is gay, but we still argue just like every other couple, okay? How reassuring to hear that. Hey, everybody, Hakim took all of Poppy 's homemade movies and turned them into a tape. They only go up to 1971, but... Shh. " Celebrating Paul Davich.

How am I ever going to live on this planet? Come over here. Look, look, look.( dings) Miserable day? Yeah. Beck, you know that was just Patch being Patch. Oh, listen, what do I care? Before that, Nono asked me if Joe had married me for my usefulness. Oh, believe me, over the years, uh, that crossed my mind, too, especially after he just... up and died, leaving me to cope with all this. What are you talking about? Oh... You know, when I first met him right here, he said, uh, " Oh, you look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know, I was n't having a wonderful time. I should 've just said that to him right then. I was here, too, you know, and I remember you walking into the Open Arms that day, and you were having a wonderful time, and my brother saw in you this gift of joy. Joy? Yeah, joy. I 'm sure you know that 's something the Davich gene pool sorely lacks. Believe me, you give all of us such joy. Oh, well, it 's not enough. It 's more than enough ; how can we survive without it? You 'd survive. Not a chance. I do n't know. I know. I know you hold all of us together with your love, with your parties, with your funny Rebecca toasts. Mm.
