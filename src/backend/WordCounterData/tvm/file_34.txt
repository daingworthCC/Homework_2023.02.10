5215341 Woman : It started out as an experiment. The first change was in the eyes. The iris separated from the pupil and it followed movement like a motion detector. I 'd watch them hours on end and when they 'd see me, they 'd stare back, unblinking, unemotional. Sometimes I swear they were laughing at me. We did n't mean for things to go as far as they did, but in a world that 's mostly covered with water we needed a new kind of defense. Just another fish in the sea. But we made a horrible mistake. We meant to take the next step in evolution, but we created a monster.( @crickets_chirping)( imitatingcrickets) -( chuckles) - How do you make that sound? It 's a family secret. But I can tell you it 's one of the reasons Mom 's had so many rich husbands. -( @all_laugh) - Change your mind yet? It 's not too late. We can forget about the whole thing. - Yeah, sure. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in your place.( buoyringing) Let 's go.( allsnickering) Thank heavens for Home Depot.( @all_laugh) - What about the power? - It 's usually off. -( screams) -( @all_scream)( laughs)( @all_laughing) More government BS. Very professional. Crime runs in the family. Daddy 's a lawyer.( girlschuckle)( foghornblows) You know the drill : Swim out to the buoy and back. Could n't be any easier. The sign said the water 's polluted. Am I gon na get sick or something? We all had to do it. Do we look sick? Do you want to be a Delta Delta Chi or do n't you? Ready? I guess so. That 's the Delta Delta spirit!( girlsgiggle)( @bell_rings) You 're such a liar. We did n't have to do this. What if something happens to her? What does it matter? You want her in the sorority?( chuckles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out here! There 's something out here in the water! Nice try! I 'm not kidding! I felt -- What 's she doing? Screw it, let 's get out of here.( policesirenwails) Oh God. This is the Military Police. You are trespassing on federal property. - Stay where you are. - If I get caught my dad 's gon na have a shit fit. - What are we supposed to do? - Take the back way out. We ca n't just leave. What about my dad 's car? Good evening. -( screams) - Mel! Mel! Mel? - Mel? -( gasps) Oh God! Help!( screams) Mel?( gasps) Grab my hand!( shrieks) Grab it! Grab it! I 've got you!( screams) Way to go, Doc! You just tied the world record of 12 ringers in a row, held by none other than... your-rr husban-nnd! Ex-husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his office. Yeah, your record 's about to go down in flames. He sounded serious.( sighs) As always, your timing is sublime. Correct me if I 'm wrong, did n't they invent something called an elevator about 100 years ago? 1853, to be exact. Why would you know that? - It 's what you love about me. - Loved. And it still does n't explain why we ca n't use it. He thinks if we 're out of breath we wo n't argue with him so much. Is that it? Where do you get that information?( doorbuzzing) Morning, Dr. Collins, Dr. Collins. You wanted to see us? I did n't have breakfast. - You know what this is? - Our project. No. Not anymore. Over. - Over? - You 're kidding. Do I look like I have my kidding face on? Is this about the EKG test data? Because I told Dr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have three hysterical college girls in the hospital right now. No no, let me rephrase that. I have three and a half hysterical girls in there. The divers are still trying to locate the rest of the fourth one. That does n't make any sense. Even if the sharks could breach the steel net -- Which they did. There is no way into this compound past the 6,000 volts going through the perimeter fence. Is there? There have been budget shortfalls. We had to make up the difference somewhere. My God, you turned off the electric fence? - Intermittently. - You did n't, Larry. How many times have I told you, Dr. Collins, my name is Lawrence? I would n't have to make any cutbacks if you two had brought me some results that I could take to the oversight committee. I 'm sorry, you do n't consider genetically engineering a new breed of Great White sharks results? Capable of living in either fresh or salt water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was yesterday. What have you done for me lately? Okay, we have managed to increase their speed. Ah-na-na! I just want to know one thing : Are the subjects responding to commands? May I? All right, Doc. I 'm on it. Okay, there 's Avery now. It 's show time. He 's scared. I guess that 's a good thing.( @tires_squeal) Okay, here they come. My God! Carcharodon carcharias can smell blood in dilutions of one part to 500 million parts of water. Killer schnozzes. They 're bigger than last time. Groucho, Harpo, Chico, Gummo, Zeppo. " The Sharks Brothers. " And here 's the baddest boy in class... Red Dog. Okay, watch this. Avery? -( electronicbeeping) - Marla : Now. You got it, Doc. That was you? The monitoring implants in each shark are also transceivers. We issue the command and the shark receives a small electric jolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meat. Does it work the other way around? I mean, can the shark be signaled to attack? Well, they are predators. I guess they could be trained -- The purpose of the Blue Demon Project was to create an undetectable defense system, not another weapon. Of course. I 'm just thinking out loud. Comfortable? So it does n't work on all of them? It 's 50-50 with Red Dog. We do n't know why. Let me get this straight. You 've spent four years and millions of dollars on this project and all I have to show for it are a couple of big sharks with pretty eyes? 90 days! I have a show-and-tell with the big brass. It 's a funding review, so that we can all keep our jobs! I want concrete results, something that will hold water besides their lungs. It 's new science, it 's unstable. We have to examine it, understand it. We ca n't possibly make that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlling them. Hmm. I 'm glad to see you two agree on something. That 'll give you something to talk about when you 're in the unemployment line! Get out!( candiesrattle) That went well. I have nothing to say to you. That would be a first. Dr. Collins? - What? - What? - Which one? - Which one? - Dr. Nathan Collins. - Guilty. This is for you. - Sign here, please. - Sure. - Thanks. - Thank you.? I got a package...?( @phone_ringing) Yes, sir. No problem. Six weeks will be just fine. - I 'm looking forward to - - -( linedisconnects) Inga! Get me a box of cigars! You might have mentioned that was coming today. I told my lawyer not to send these here. I 'll just have them sent to your lawyer so she can take a look at them -- No need. You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put up a bit more of a fight? No, of course not. Of course not. And in return, I 'm only gon na ask for one thing. And what 's that? Nathan? I want the ring back.( @alarm_beeping) - It was my grandmother 's, remember? - Of course. - She gave it to my mother. - Absolutely. And then on her deathbed she gave it to me -- I know the story, Nathan. Thank you. I 'll be right back. Hey, Gummo, Groucho, Red Dog. Listen up, boys. Word of advice : Do n't get married. You see something you like, you swim up behind it and then eat it. Got it? Maybe she does n't really want a divorce. What? Psychologically, I mean. Maybe somewhere deep in her subconscious she still has feelings for you, and it 's causing her body to rebel against her own actions. That 's why she ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Oh, no, I have n't heard the story 50 times! Men. Stupid grandmother 's aunt 's uncle 's neighbor 's I do n't care whose ring - - Stupid-( ringrolling) - No! No! No! No!( gasps) Thank you, thank you, thank you. I never would have heard the end of that. Whoa! She 's still in love. Yeah. Oh shit! Marla! Holy shit! -( @gun_cocks) - Shoot, God damn it! Shoot!( gunshot)( @gun_cocks)( gunshot) -( gunshot) -( @gun_cocks) -( gunshot) -( @gun_cocks) -( gunshot) -( @gun_cocks) -( gunshot) -( @gun_cocks) -( gunshot) -( @gun_cocks) -( gunshot) -( @gun_cocks) Okay, I gotcha. Come on, okay. Okay, it 's okay.( crying) How you doing there, cowboy? You 're not looking so good.( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should never go shot for shot with me. Tequila is my middle name. Come on, get this stuff out. The sooner we get this done, the sooner you two ladies can go take a nap. Come on, we got about a five-hour window here. That fence is not going to fix itself.( indistinctmurmuring) Hey! Mr. Secretary. Mr. Secretary. Mr. Secretary. Felix, Mr. Secretary. Look at him. You 'd think he 'd given birth to the damn fish. We are so not ready, Nathan.( shoesqueaks) Ah, General Remora, what a pleasure it is to see you, sir! Remora : Nice pants! Pretty impressive, huh? All this fruit salad here just to see our little project. Even the top man himself. Makes you proud to be a scientist, does n't it? Is everything ready, Avery? As ready as it can be, Doc. You 're not dealing with a moron here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moron. Just so you guys know, nothing escapes my attention. Your fly 's open. Ladies and gentlemen, if you 'll be seated, we can begin. Thank you all for coming this morning for what is quite possibly the most important presentation you 'll ever see. Now, I 'd like to present General Remora, who would like to say a few words before we begin. General. What I 'm about to say to you... must be kept... in the utmost... confidence. That is why I had to get a Level Five security clearance for each and every one of you. And that 's why we 're meeting in this underwater... secured and protected bunker. In 1997, the Russian government informed us... that it may have lost at least 100 of their so-called " suitcase bombs. "( whistles) One kiloton... portable nuclear bombs, small enough and light enough to be carried in a suitcase. And very possibly a backpack. - What 's your name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avery Dashlow, sir. Right. For some time we 've been concerned about the possibility of terrorist threat. And as of three days ago, our intelligence has informed us that one of these bombs had been purchased by a splinter group from an ex-Russian agent. Nathan, I know this is n't exactly the time to bring this up, - but... - Yes? - Um... - Ahem! It can wait. Further intelligence has informed us that this bomb will more than likely be arriving by water. And its goal very possibly being a very important landmark on or near this coast. That is why Project Blue Demon is of the utmost importance to our government. And, as Mr. Van Allen already knows, as of yesterday, the President of the United States of America has personally asked me... to oversee this project. I 'd like everyone to put their hands in their lap. Very good. I will now turn everything back over to Mr. Van Allen. General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessible water in and around the country. You know I hate when you do that. Do what? Tell me you have something to tell me and then telling me to forget about it. Lawrence : So what is the answer? More military? More Coast Guard? It would take three times the current numbers of enlisted men and women just to make a dent. No, the human element has done all that it can. It 's time now to take the next step toward complete military preparedness. I present Project Blue Demon... a squadron of genetically engineered sharks, smarter and stronger than any other species on earth. Trained and controlled by our military and strategic experts to seek out and neutralize terrorist threats wherever they may be found. Maybe I do it because you never seem interested in anything I have to say anyway. Maybe if you 'd say things that were interesting, instead of dull scientific facts all the time, I would be. A bomb surreptitiously placed by an innocuous looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most watchful security system might miss. But Blue Demon misses nothing. Its natural and genetically-heightened territorial instinct. The shark locates the bomb before it can detonate. Now, if this sounds like science fiction, it 's not. It 's science fact. - So are you gon na tell me? - Not when you 've predetermined your response. Can you stop being scientific for one moment and start being a human being? Thanks. Thanks a lot. All right, I 'll tell you, but you have to promise that you wo n't be angry. - I 'm not - -! - Nathan! I 'm not angry. Open the curtain.( murmuring) Blue Demon. Okay. I... you know -- See, that 's exactly what I 'm talking about. Is this supposed to be some kind of a joke? Oh my God. -( tappingkeyboard) -( computerbeeps) Where the hell are my sharks? - Somebody opened the gate. - Do n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Who let the guppies out? - Apparently none of us. I do n't give a good goddamn who let them out! I want them back in here now! I got some very important people in there waiting, so I do n't want to hear the word rain check from any one of you. I 'll just send the command out to Red Dog and the others will follow him back into the lake. If he 's still out there. What are you talking about, Dashlow? Something 's wrong. I just sent out a return command and I 'm not getting a delivery signal. Did you try an alternate channel? I 'm on full frequency - - nothing! Let me try. Anybody got the time? Too damn late for this bullshit! That 's what time it is. Hey, did you guys hide my respirator? You dogs, I know you hid my respirator! What are those? We were scheduled to keep the sharks inside all day today. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Normal replacement of section of perimeter fence. Nathan : Maintenance, this is an emergency, do you copy? Maintenance, this is Dr. Nathan Collins. Do you read me? Maintenance, this is Dr. Nathan Collins. You need to get out of the water now! Do you read me? Over. How much longer are we gon na have to wait for these trained fish of yours? Just a few more moments, sir. There 's been a small miscommunication and they 've been moved out into an enclosed high-security lagoon. Part of our facility. But there 's nothing to worry about. Everything 's under control.( crunch) - Still not getting anything. - Well try another transmitter. I tried all of them. I ca n't seem to get a response. Dr. Collins, if you people screw this thing up -- Nathan : Marla, do you read me, over? - I 'm here, Nathan. - Give me some good news. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still doing in the water? Nobody 's answering the radio. We 're on our way out there now. Copy?( beeping) Oh my God. Nathan, the sharks, they 're in hunt formation. Nathan : Maintenance, this is an emergency, do you copy? Yeah, it 's always an emergency. Someone probably plugged up the toilet again. Maintenance, this is an emergency, do you copy? This is an emergency! Yeah, this is maintenance. What 's your emergency? There are sharks in the lake! Do you copy? Ed, Jimmy! Get out of the water! There 's sharks in the water! Get out! Ed, Jimmy, come on! Get in the - - no! Get out of the water! Katie : Jimmy! Ed!( crying) Oh, God!( @tires_screech) Oh my God! They were just out there! - It 's over. - No, it 's not over. This is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something. Every hard drive in the system 's up to speed. Not a crash, not a buzz. - Nothing. - Could have told you that. I know this lab inside and out and there 's nothing wrong with this equipment. I 've got six runaway sharks. Who would beg to differ? They 're moving towards populated areas. I thought you had this problem worked out. Whoever let them out sabotaged the system. Then I guess it 's time for the backup plan. You do have a backup plan? How ' bout a reboot? Maybe we should just shut the whole thing down - and start from scratch. - Brilliant, Sparky. - Worth a try. - It 'll take time. - Then you 'd better get on it right now. - What are you gon na do? What we should have done in the first place. I 'm calling the Coast Guard to let them know we got a predator problem on our hands. I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General! Thought you had left. As I stated before, we 've decided we 're not going to do the demonstration today. They 're not in the lagoon, are they?( coughs) We 've got the situation under control. -( @siren_wails) - Voice : T-minus 10, nine, eight - -( switchesoff) Does n't look like you have anything under control. They 're headed toward beaches. We have to warn people. Tell them. Tell them what? That a group of government sanctioned genetic experiments has gotten loose? No. If they found out that the military was behind this, we 'd be in a shitstorm of apocalyptic proportions! No, I think what we have here is just regular, everyday run-of-the-mill sharks. And the truth of the matter is sharks kill people, every day. But not in a freshwater lake. Minor detail. Are you actually willing to risk life just to keep the government 's involvement in this a secret? That is indefensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people will be killed. Every war has their casualties. I do n't see any reason the war on terrorism should be any different. Screw that.( @door_buzzes) Get me the number for the Coast Guard. Yeah. Hey, what the hell do you think you 're doing? Do n't worry, Doctor, you 'll get to make your one phone call. - What are you talking about? - Dr. Nathan Collins, - you 're under arrest. - On what charge? Conspiracy to commit a terrorist act against the United States of America. General, I understand what you 're trying to do here, but you have no evidence of anything like that. I have all the evidence I need. This is a log for all the security pass codes for the shark pool. And it has the number of the last code used - to open the gates. - And whose number is that? - Dr. Nathan Collins. -( snorts) Please. Which means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the lagoon, but you are responsible for the deaths of those two unfortunate maintenance workers. He 's doing this because he does n't want me telling anyone about the sharks. I 'm doing this because I love my country. Take him away. Get me a lawyer! This is not over! No, like this. You have to hook the worm through his body like that so he does n't fall off the hook. Here, now you try. I do n't want to. Honey, the worm does n't feel anything. It does n't hurt him. Yeah, how would you like it if I stuck a hook up your -- That 's enough, young lady. Why do we have to do this anyway? Ca n't we just buy fish at the store? No, we ca n't just buy fish at the store. That 's not a sport. This is a sport. Baseball 's a sport. Basketball 's a sport. This is murder! Roxie, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, did n't you? - Yeah. - And you wanted to go fishing with Daddy, too, did n't you? - Yes. - Now you got a 10-lb. test line here, with an eight-lb. leader. Just set it over the side right here. There you go. All right, now we 'll just see who catches the big one, huh? Hey, what 's up, doc? Oh, I guess I 'm just a little blurry here. Yeah, you gon na go somewhere? Just a little fresh air. Be right back. You want me to go with you? Avery, " fresh air " is a euphemism. I 'm going to the ladies ' room. - Oh. - Yeah.( reelspinning) Dad, I think I 've got something! Way to go! Reel him in! - Not too fast. - It 's really heavy. It 's probably a trout. They get pretty big in these waters.( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself a whopper here, girl! Let 's try to get him in now. Let 's reel it in. That 's it, bring it in here. Yeah, it 's a big one! Wowee! Okay, here it comes. Roxie : Oh my God! You got him! Let 's get him. Oh, yeah! Okay, good job! Oh, yeah! Look what you caught here! Hold it, I 'll get a photo. Slimy! - Let me get a photo. Okay, hold it up. - It 's wet! Attagirl. Hold it right there. -( gasps) - What the hell? - What 's the matter, honey? - It 's a shark! It 's a bass, silly. Dad! Dad! Shark! Hurry, swim! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! - Swim! - Dad, grab this! Swim, that 's right! Do n't look back! Swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me your hand. Dad, keep swimming. Please, hurry! Sharks, that way! There you go! I got you. Dad, I love you. I love you, Dad. Marla! Thank God, finally! Did you talk to the lawyer? Is he coming down to get me out of here? I 'm afraid not, Nathan. What, are you kidding me? They ca n't just hold me here without formal charges, without any evidence. Well apparently they can. Just the suspicion of you being a terrorist is enough for them to lock you up in here indefinitely. Wait, this is nuts. I brought you some food. I feel like I 'm stuck in some play by Kafka. Watch your language, sir. - What? - Your language. - I said Kafka. - I heard what you said. There 's a lady present. Appreciate it if you 'd keep it clean. I 'll take that, ma'am. Oh, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Doctor Collins. Please? - I 'll have to check it. - It 's nothing special, but it was all they had in the cafeteria.( chuckles) - All right. -( pistolfires) Christ, Marla, what the hell are you doing? Getting you out of here. I appreciate the thought, but should n't we wait to do this, I do n't know, the legal way? While I was rebooting the system I ran through the program logs and checked it against my private backup file. The reason the system crashed was because it was n't the real system. It was some shadow program - built of top of the original. -( keysjangle) It was designed to hide in the hard drives when we tried to fix it. Are you telling me that somebody tried to hack in from the outside? Not that kind of program, no. This came from somebody who had access to our entire system from the inside. - Avery? - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. He would never put himself out of a job. This came from higher up. I ca n't believe you just tranked that guy. I did n't know you had it in you. There 's a lot of things you did n't know about me, Nathan.( gasps) Sorry. Dr. Collins, I need an up - - where is she? - Ladies ' room. - How long has she been gone? - I do n't know, 20 minutes, maybe. - 20 minutes? Hey, chicks take forever in the bathroom. Idiot!( @woman_screams)( woman#2screams)( @toilet_flushes) This is Lawrence Van Allen to the holding cell. Come in. This is Lawrence Van Allen to the guard holding Dr. Collins. Do you copy? Holding cell, come in! Do something! My God. What happened? Where 'd they go?( grunts) Put security on full alert! Find Dr. Collins. Man : Which one? Both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. - Hi, Mark. It 's so lovely today I just thought I 'd play hooky. No problem, Doctor. I just got ta check out your car. - My car? - Yeah, it 's a new company policy. I guess there 's some stuff that 's gone missing - from a couple of the labs. - Really? Yeah, I know, who 'd want to steal a couple of test tubes, huh? Anyway, I got ta check every vehicle that goes out of here. It 's not your fault though. Of course not. - This is fine. - Oh, good good. - Well, have a nice day. - Trunk too. - The trunk? - Yeah. It 's a real pain in the butt, ma'am. Sorry. Man on radio : Gate Security, come in. - Excuse me. - Wait. Look, I 'm kind of in a rush, you know, to get to the beach so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check my trunk out first - and then I 'll get out of your hair? - Yeah, sure. I guess whatever they 're squawking about can wait a sec. Thank you so much. You 're the best. And just because of that, I 'm gon na give you the honor of checking out my trunk. What the hell? Now, I know this looks suspicious, uh...( groans) Nathan! See, I bet there are still things about me you do n't know. - Obviously you 're right. - Hey, come on! - It 's so pretty. - Not as pretty as you. Smooth. - The water looks great. - Uh-huh. We should go for a swim. I did n't bring my suit. You do n't need a suit. LC, are you crazy? We ca n't just take off our clothes. Why not? There 's nobody around. Right now. What if somebody comes? So what if they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So who 's gon na know? You 're a very bad influence on me, you know that? If you 're afraid to do it, I understand. - I 'm not afraid. - Oh yeah? Hey, you did bring your suit! - Coming? - Yeah. What are you doing? This water 's cold, baby. So who 's afraid now? What would I possibly be afraid of? You know, that was my first kiss. Really? Where are you going? To the moon! That was my first kiss, too. Well, ready or not, here I come. LC? Very funny, LC. Shark! Shark! Come on, I 've been called worse. Oh my God! Come on! Okay, keep your eyes open. If you see anybody - - cops, security, anybody - - take off. No, I 'm not gon na leave you. I was hoping you 'd say that. Hang tight, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guard? Okay good. I need to speak to whoever 's in charge of... well, sharks. Okay, I know this is gon na sound crazy, but, uh... My name? That 's not important. What 's important is that you need to send your boats out right now armed with everything you 've got. Why? Because... because there are half a dozen government-grown killer sharks on the hunt along the beaches of this city. And unless your people take action right now a lot of people are going to die. Hello? Aw, do n't do this. Hello? Hey, I 'm serious here! Hello! Goddamn bureaucrats! Shit! Marla! - Change for a 20? - No! Hey! You guys got change for a 20? Thank you. Unbelievable. Un-believable! - So how 'd it go with the Coast Guard? - Not great. - Well, I got something better, this. - Which is? The prototype to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough version, but it might work. The signal might be a little weak, but if I can tap into the lab 's transmitter and then into this -- You 're going to try to control six sharks with your laptop, a cell phone and a car radio? That 's your problem, Nathan. You 're always so negative. - Negative? - Negative, yes, negative. You might try seeing the cup half full for a change.( radioswitcheson) Reporter : In other news, police are on a manhunt this hour for Dr. Marla and Nathan Collins from Acro Marine with alleged ties to a terrorist organization working right here in Northern California. They are considered armed and dangerous... Hmm, you 're right. Things are looking up already. Now back to the music. I 've been at it for two solid hours. I 'm starving, dude. Well, do n't let our little emergency come between you and your Twinkies! How much longer before the reboot is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wait a sec. - What now? - There 's another signal here. Somebody 's tapped into the command frequency. - They 're trying to communicate with the sharks. - It 's them. Looks like they 're using a phone line to hack into the system. Probably a cell phone. Can you track the signal, find out where they are? Yeah, I guess. But that 's like totally illegal. Hello! Government. That 's what we do. Find them! Not cool. - Anything? - Still searching for a signal. Look, maybe you 're right. Maybe this is a stupid idea. Hey, do n't say that. - Why not? It 's what you 're thinking anyway. - No it 's not. It 's okay, Nathan. I 'm a big girl, I can take it. I was thinking you 're the smartest wom -- you 're the smartest human being I 've ever met. It 's what attracted me to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I thought it was my ass. Well, okay, maybe it was a little bit your ass. I watch you, you know? When you work. and you get that far away look in your eyes, and I wonder what it must be like to be in there with you. What was that thing that you were gon na tell me before all this started? Okay, um - -( computerbeeping) I got a signal! I found them! Oh my God. Okay, they breached the lake. They 're in the ocean. - They 're still traveling in a group formation. - Where are they? Well, according to this, just a few miles ahead. Okay good, this is a nice desolate area. Let 's just hope they find a nice long, lonely beach with nobody around for miles. - This is not good. - No it 's not. The noise, the splashing, this is like ringing a dinner bell for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can send the command and get them to return to the compound. If the uplink to the main transmitter holds, then I -- - Nathan, I 'm just not sure. - Hey! Think positive. Give it a shot. - What are you doing? - I did n't have much luck with the Coast Guard. Let 's see if I can convince these kids I 'm not crazy. Have you actually seen these sharks around here? No, not exactly, but we 've been tracking them from down the coast. My wife - - well, my ex-wife, she 's in the car with a computer... -( sighs) -... trying to send a signal to them - with her cell phone -- - Okay, look, Doctor... - Collins. - Dr. Collins. I know you 're probably under a lot of stress, but they have laws against drinking on the beach. Drinking alone, that is.( @girl_screams) Keep trying, Jen! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You need to step out of the vehicle, please. - I 'm sorry. - You need to exit the vehicle now, ma'am. Jesus Christ! It 's a shark! It 's a shark! Get out of here! Holy cow! Come on! Get out of the water! Come on! Everybody out! Hey, come on! There are sharks in the water. What are you doing? Come here! Come on! Hey, come here!( sobbing) Dr. Collins, look out!( @alarm_sounding) - Fuck it! -( computerbuzzes) Hi. Hi. How do you feel? Okay, I guess. My leg 's a little itchy. What the hell? No! Oh, God, no! No! Bad dream? Oh, God, okay. What happened? I um... overloaded the signal. Blew the chips. They 're dead? Oh God, Marla, I 'm sorry. This project... those sharks were your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're up. That 'll save me having to repeat myself. Lawrence, I think this can wait until after Nathan gets some rest. I had six very expensive sharks at the start of this. I now have none. Somebody has to pay. Take a hike, Larry. - Four. - What? There were only four sharks at the beach. I only saw four. Are you sure? Trust me, it 's not something I would forget. This is Van Allen. How many carcasses did you retrieve? I see. And did you -- Thank you. Four. Another one dead from an overzealous fisherman. No sign of the sixth one anywhere. Okay, they 've been traveling in school formation all along. What would finally make them separate? Maybe they did n't. Maybe they were never together in the first place. Hey, guys, great job with the sharks! I heard all about it. You guys deserve a medal. Stuff it, Avery. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Wha - - how 'd that happen? - Says it 's real time. - But it 's not monitoring anything at all. - This is a program he made, a decoy. - To throw us off track. You guys do n't know what you 're talking about. You know they 're dangerous. You were after them! They 're terrorists! All right, " dude, " where 's my shark? I believe I can answer that question for you. Ah, General. We did n't expect to see you.( @gun_cocks) Everybody up against the wall. Not you, Dashlow. Oh, yeah. General, I 'm not sure I understand. Of course you do n't understand, Van Allen. Because you 're nothing more than a patsy. This whole thing - - the computer shutdown, the sharks ' escape - - it was all you. He had a little help. Why, Avery? You ca n't buy Porsches with dreams. The money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? You 're a patriot, for God 's sake! That 's exactly why, because I am a patriot. This government of ours is weak. We were doing okay for a while there. We had our heads on straight about terrorism. But now they 're starting to divert money into social programs, schools, the homeless, the poor. Before you know it our military wo n't be more than a couple of Boy Scouts walking around carrying penknives. Well it 's not gon na happen on my watch! Then I thought this shark of yours... well, now if he can defuse a bomb, he sure as hell can deliver one. Red Dog. Smartest in the class.( grunts) - World record! - Nice toss.( groans) I 'm going to get him. No no come back! Forget about him! We need to find Red Dog. He said it could plant a bomb. Is that possible? If he 's programmed it outside our system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a separate lab somewhere else with a control program tapped into ours. - Avery. - Avery. Cheap, just like I suspected.( @engine_starts) Where are you going, Avery? Come here, you lousy punk! Avery 's been doing his homework. Okay. -( keyboardsclicking) -( computerbeeping) Charming. Okay, this is the original command program and that is the shadow program that he created. And here 's our missing shark. It 's Red Dog. Whoa whoa! What is that? I do n't know. It 's reading on the image. Oh my God. Plutonium. It 's the Russian suitcase bomb. Remora bought it for himself. What 's the target? Somewhere further up the coast. I 'm just getting the coordinates now. I 'll just bring it up here on the map. And I 'll try to reprogram Red Dog. You ca n't try, Marla. You can do it. Okay, and it should be right there. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remora 's not gon na pay. But I bet somebody else will for that. Nathan?( electricalzapping)( @engine_starts) Ow! What the? Avery! You dumb-ass moron!( @tires_screeching)( @tires_screeching) My God!( @tires_screeching)( shrieks) God!( shrieks) - Are you all right? - Yeah, I 'm okay, yeah. The command key!( bombbeeping) -( sighs) - Wait, where 's he going now? Without a command program the chip defaults... to the original setting. Hello, this is Lawrence Van Allen calling. Yes, I was wondering, is that teaching position at the university still open? Yes I 'll hold. You can forget about that tenure of yours, Van Allen. I 'll make sure of that. Another trumped-up charge, General? I do n't think so. It 's you alone who will be counting ceiling tiles at Leavenworth. I 've been through three wars, two invasions and one hell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be brought down by some goddamn fish!( alarmblares) Can you say sushi? -( lockbuzzes) -( doorseals)( explosion) Radio announcer : A nuclear accident at Acro Marine Laboratory was just that - - an accident. There 's been no evidence of foul play and absolutely no indications of terrorist involvement. Thankfully the facility is equipped with lead- shielded walls to handle such incidents and the repercussions, if any, are negligible to the public safety. There will be an investigation and a full hearing into the matter. - You ready for this? - All I can do is tell the truth. I 'll just tell them exactly what happened. - Wait. - What? You never told me. That thing that you were gon na tell me? Oh right, that. Um... Yeah, that, uh... so, what do you say? Right here, right now, before flag and country, what was it? The divorce papers. Yeah? I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean, after everything that we 've been through, I guess, I could still go and -- Remember you dropped this? Want to see if it still fits? Perfect. God, I missed that ass! Come on, kids. They 're waiting. Senator : All right, Dr. Collins, why do n't you all start at the beginning. Tell us how this all happened. Marla : As you know, Senator, with the airways relatively safe it was time to begin covertly securing our oceans and waterways. It started out as an experiment. The first change was in the eyes. The iris separated from the pupil and it followed movement like a motion detector. I 'd watch them hours on end and when they 'd see me they 'd stare back, unblinking, unemotional. Sometimes I swear they were laughing at me. We did n't mean for things to go as far as they did, but in a world that 's mostly covered with water we needed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea. But we made a horrible mistake. We meant to take the next step in evolution, but we created a monster. Senator : I see. And would you say it was possible for this sort of thing to happen again? Honestly, Senator, I do n't know.( jawscrunch)( @rock_music_playing)? Day in the life?? Of someone just like me?? Who walks on the straight line?? But still can not?? Still can not see that??
