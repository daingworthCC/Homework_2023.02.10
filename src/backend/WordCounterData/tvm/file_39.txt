The room will be gloomy. A time to smile! Now that all of us are graduating together... You are right! We owe you everything, Yankumi! You can say that again. eh? During this year, since we met, There are many things we had done together, Everything... all wonderful memories There is nothing more I can teach. Be sure to act in a dignified and mature manner. Yankumi! Where are you going?! I 'm so sorry! There is a place I must go by all means. All of you! I 'll never forget... Yankumi! Kumiko-san! Shinohara-san! Are you really sure? Yes. My life from now on, not as a teacher, but as a woman, together with Shinohara-sama, I want to spend. Kumiko-san! Shinohara-san! Ojyo=short form of Ojyo-sama or Ojyosan, which means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss. Ojyo! Stop it! Ojyo! Ojyo! Ojyo! Minoru! You bastard! I 'm innocent! Ojyo! What what... What 's happening? What 's this commotion? Minoru, you coward. Unfair to attack me while I 'm sleeping. Minoru, what have you done to Ojyo? You bastard! Just a blanket... she might catch a cold What? A blanket? She must 've been daydreaming. So cute, is n't she? Ojyo! Drooling... there... Dreaming about me? Shinohara-san was so cool... Kumiko-san! Good morning. Good morning. Yamaguchi Sensei! Yamaguchi Sensei, too formal... Call me K U M I K O. Kumiko? Kumiko. Yes! Oh! To Australia? Yes. You mean a prize trip to overseas? Though it 's an unknown 4th-grade university Mom and Dad, got so excited and happy. Great! Food is delicious. When do you go? 10 day trip from today. From today? Why are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school? Due to Dad 's business,( Oyaji=Dad, Father) We can only fly today. No problem, is n't it? No more classes for seniors. What do you do with our plan? Sorry, As parents are so happy, I could not refuse... What 's your secret talk? None of your business. As such, see to it, Yankumi. OK? Rats! Do n't forget my souvenirs! I 'll be happy with anything I can eat. I wonder why he came here today. See you at the Graduation Ceremony, Minami! See you, all! Today is the last day for the Senior Classes, We only have Graduation Ceremony and several attendance days. Many thanks should go to your efforts, We have great results on student 's accomplishments. Look at the board, please. My 3-A class has filled in all University spots. Great work! Ronin=a student who failed in entrance exams. My Class, though I have 3 Ronin students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I had some scared moments. But we filled in every spot last week. Vice Principal( Kyoto), we can have a peaceful Graduation Ceremony. You are correct. Except One Class... Yamaguchi Sensei, 5 students have n't decided. What 's the meaning of this? These 5 's exam results will be announced next week. Probably they all passed the exams. " Probably " can not cut it here. But 3-D has a dazzling victory winner. Sawada Shin Passed Waseda University( **29;760;TOOLONG) Keio University( EconomicsDept) Yes, yes, yes. Sawada passed Waseda and Keio University. On top of it, he is a Valedictorian! Is n't he something? He 's a proud student of 3-D... No, Shirokin Gakuin High School 's honor, His achievement shall become a legend here. Agree? Then, everyone tries hard until the Graduation Ceremony. Yes At one time, we worried a lot about them. But everyone can graduate from 3-D. I 'm happy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During this period, students go so easy. So it 's the most dangerous time. Japanese proverb. Yudan Taiteki Issun Saki wa Yami. Unpreparedness is one 's greatest enemy. A black hole might be an inch ahead. They grew up a lot. There is no worry, I 'm sure. You, stupid! Very bad... Idiot! Playing catch in the hallway. Is this a proof of " They grew up a lot? " Yamaguchi Sensei? I 'm sorry. Listen good. There is always a possibility that you shall be expelled Even on the very day of Graduation. Expelled? Of course, Yamaguchi Sensei. You must take a responsibility if such a thing should occur. What 's that? Yankumi must be fired, as well? Of course. A home room teacher must take a rap. Vice Principal, as you can see, they learned... They are still staring at me. Hey! I 'll overlook this time. I appreciate your noble act. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back. Go, hurry. Go back to the class room. You have a broad mind. A perfect deed as a Principal-to-be. Kouchou=Principal What did you say? A Princial-to-be? Do n't be so hasty, Washio, the Vice Principal-To-Be. Kyoto=Vice Principal Vice Principal? What is this? You did n't know? Principal Shirakawa has been promoted to be an Education Comittee Council from this April. Education Committee? Very sad to part from Shirokin Gakuin School. Since when were you there? Just right now. As such, Vice Principal will assume a Principal position from this April. Sawatari, the Principal-to-be... So I say, it 's too early, Washio, Vice Principal-to-be. You are right. One woman scandal can wipe off your promotion. Unpreparedness is one 's greatest enemy. A black hole might be an inch ahead. Was that Satsuki-chan of the Cabaret Paradise? Anyhow, Yamaguchi Sensei, up until the very moment of graduation, You take full control of all students of 3-D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that everyone will get a diploma. 3-D 's Graduation Trip To IZU Shuzenji " Gold Dragon Inn " Do n't forget to come at 8:00 A.M. Do n't be late! Amazing, you printed this, too? Why not? This is our Graduation Trip. But I envy Minami! Koala? Onsen is much better than that. Kouhei-kun, you are jealous. It 's so obvious. Hey, Is it really OK not to invite Yankumi? She might be very mad if she found out. You are right. I think it 's OK. She is a teacher, after all. We can not fully enjoy ourselves with a chaperon. What a rare statement from Shin-chan. " Fully Enjoy Ourselves ", etc. Is that right? So we must make sure. Yankumi never knows about it. Sure! Damn! I hate Vice Principal. What 's the matter? He declared that he would expel anyone if we caused any troubles. What? And Yankumi must be fired, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A School Rule Book does not regulate a trip. If it is only a trip. How about alcohol? How about cigarettes and girls? No girls involved this time. I ca n't think of a trip without alcohol and cigarettes No way! No way! It 's Ok as long as they do n't find out. You are right. Sure right! Yankumi wo n't lose her job, as long as school does n't know. Yes! Yes! This 'll be the last time we can do silly things together. Let 's enjoy our Graduation Trip! Yay! Oh, great! You finally understood the rule. " When a teacher came, you keep quiet. " It 's a reward that I had tried a lot for all this time. Yes! Yes! We all owe to Yankumi. We appreciate Yankumi from the bottom of our hearts. You... You grew up to be responsible adults. Why being tricked so easily? Today is the last day of the 3rd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are several more days you must come to school Anyhow, do n't do silly things, Especially no fighting. If you got hospitalized, you ca n't attend graduation You understood? Yes! Noda, Oishi, Shimazu, Maeda and Fujiwara! Next Monday is your verdict day. You must all come to report the results without fail. Yes. I do n't think I passed. Me, neither. Stop being a wimp. I have confidence in you. Got it? OK. 3-D. All of us are going to graduate together! Oh! I ca n't feel secured until I hear results from these 5. Hey, hey, hey! Do n't you want to go to a one-day trip to Onsen tomorrow? Onsen? I had a plan with my friends. But they canceled... You want to go? I have coupons for 3. Gladly. I 'm not in the mood for Onsen. I know how you feel. But what you can do is just to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look of a Home-Room Teacher is a bad omen. A bad omen?( Engi=omen) For your hard-working students, You must become a Goddess of Victory. A Goddess?( Megami=Goddess) A Goddess must be clean in mind and body. That 's where Onsen comes in! Yes, I 'm going, too. Onsen? With Fujiyama Sensei and Kawashima Sensei. 3 of us together. Can we tag along, too? No. There 's no need to come. I see. For Onsen, why do you need these weird things? Graduation is so close... I 'm busy for preparation... so I debated myself a little... That 's where relaxaton comes in. Yes, I think so, too. Yes. Students are graduating... Joyous occasion, is n't it? Yep. Ojyo, will you take a look at this? When it comes to Graduation Ceremony, It is a Gala Occasion for Ojyo. And your first students ' graduation. For that precious moment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Please! What is it? Prepare Yourself To Die. Where on earth can you find these? You did not... like it. You know... I appreciate it. I 'll put it in a candidate list of what to wear. Thank you! Do you think that they can really graduate? I 'm not so sure... Do n't jinx it. I 'm sorry. Meshi=Meals, food, etc. Asa-meshi=breakfast Hiru-meshi=lunch Ban-meshi=dinner Let 's eat dinner. Yes! Only myself going to Onsen,... My hard working students, I 'm sorry. We go on a Graduation Trip tomorrow! Yay! Nice bath... I want to use it. Let 's bathe together, shall we? Noooo!

You should die first. Get off the stage! They seem to be having fun. Thank you. I owe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, of course! They seem to enjoy themselves... but they have something deep in heart. Even they had decided what to do after graduation It might not be the same as they wanted or some problems of their home, What 's the matter? Actually, With that waitress, I 'm going out.( **31;791;TOOLONG) With Wakaba-chan? Then, hurry and go. But kind of difficult to sneak out... I have noticed all of you. If you want to leave this room, you must get approval from me. One minute for toilet. You understood? Be ready to leave at the cue. You are stupid, are n't you? Is it true? Yes. Sawada, I 'll leave everything to you. Shin, you are great. What did you say to Yankumi? Iwashita Shima is in the Women 's Bath House. Did you really? She is a big fan of Gokutsuma. Hurry up.

I ca n't eat any more. Help! Uchiyama-kun is in trouble. Only 3000 yen inside. Cheap. Student ID # 9226 Uchiyama Haruhiko Shirokin High School He 's just a high school kid. Just a kid... Uchii... You bastard! What did you do to him? Uchii, are you OK? You are from the same high. If it were so, what happens next? I wonder if it is OK to fool around at this time of the night. We should report this to school. And the teacher should be called. Get out of here. Stop it. Wan na fight? That 'll be great. Stop it. We ca n't just let it go. Hands off. Or you 'll be expelled, if they reported it. None of your business. It 's our business. Yankumi might lose her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Yankumi 's dream, is n't it? We ca n't break her dreams. Stop mumbling. They are late, are n't they? What should we do? You guys... You want to die now? I 'm scared. Where did they go? They might be doing some stupid things. It 's freezing cold out here. Help! Uchiyama-san and others are in trouble. Uchiyama and others... Stop. Listen you guys... You must not butt in at any cost. What a wimp! They are nothing. We can stop beating now. Stop right there! Yankumi... Who the hell are you? Hang in there. Are you OK? I 'm sorry. You... Why beaten like this? We ca n't break our promise. We must graduate all together. You... How could you beat up people with no resistance. What low life human beings! Hey you! Do n't you know who we are? Hey! Hands off. Did n't I tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who the hell are you? Me?

Now hand over the money you stole from them. Take it, Take it. I 'm returning it. You... I 'm sorry. My fault. Now they know Yankumi is a teacher. I 'm afraid you might lose the job. I ca n't be a teacher with a fear of " losing a job " You 've saved an injured buddy. On top of it, You did n't fight back only for me. What 's wrong with me protecting you? If that is not acceptable, I 'll be willing to quit teacher. Yankumi... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud of you! You, guys! We 're gon na graduate all together. Oh! Onsen... I have n't been there for long time. Why did n't you tag us along? Onsen is really great. Flesh is so soft and smooth. I 've never soaked in the bathtub. Maybe I should take a day off and go there. Then, how about going together? How about during a spring break? Spring break? After graduation, I am totally free. How about with me? One to one... I can go any time. I see, graduation is coming closer. Yes! A time to part from my students is just around the corner. It is kind of sad, kind of happy... Shinohara-san, I need your advice. What should I wear? A Formal suit? Or maybe... Hakama? More like costume play? I have not decided what to wear, either. Jersey is good for you. Jersey? There is no one like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love it. You just said you love? You love... Let 's go. How about a Woman Police Uniform? eh? Seibu Police... Costume Play! How about a play with me? No.... Only 5 days to graduation... Long time to wait... or short time... I 'm afraid I might cry in the Ceremony. Me, too. It 's the time to say goodbye to students. 3 years after their enrollment, Every single day... Like a revolving lantern, I can remember... You might remember every one 's face... Aogeba Totoshi( SongofGratitude) - In Tampopo, homeless sings this song to a former doctor. A climax is a song " Aogeba Toutoshi " by all students. It 's sad, is n't it? It 's great, is n't it? Is n't it sad? It 'll be a joyous day. On the contrary, I am happy. Thinking that I do n't have to deal with 3-D. huh? I understand. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... a nightmare. Is this really what he was thinking? Sawada, what 's up? I summoned him. Sawada, have you decided? Waseda or Keio? Not yet. Not yet? Decide ASAP. Hey, Sawada! If you can not decide, you talk to me anytime. Yes... You know, I... What is it? Sawada. I... Yes? What is it? Never mind. No reservations. I 'm alright. Anytime, you hear? Oishi-kun 's result should be in already. Shin Nippon Hei Sei University and Noda 's Mikado Art Collegeshould have announced names of successful candidates at 10. a.m. It 's high time the phone rang if they had passed. Probably they want to come directly to a teacher 's room. I see. Maybe so. How was your result? Ca n't you tell? Then, you, too? That 's right. I did it. I passed the exam. I passed! Me, too. Shin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Shimazu? They took the same university exam, did n't they? They were not admitted. That 's bad. How about Noda? Noda failed, too. I ca n't believe it. It 's tough. You... Noda Oishi Shimazu Good morning. Ahhh... Noda Takeshi failed in Mikado Art College. Well... I flunked, too. Shin Nippon Heisei University. Me, too. I became a Ronin. Cheer up somehow. Cheer up. Kuma, you brought that, did n't you? eh? Do n't eh me! Pictures from our Graduation Trip. Yeah, yeah... Let me see, let me see... You are always eating something. Japanese delicacy-Some are baked, some put on sticks, some are made with sweet rice( mochi) and some made with rice powder. They are often filled with a sweet bean paste called " An ". This manju was tasty. I want to go again. With everyone. Why not? As a class reunion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Week in May? I 'm coming! Sure. Look! Hey, pictures turned out to be great. I do n't wan na. I ai n't have time for this. I 'm sorry. Hey! You did n't have to be so nasty. Kuma just wanted... to cheer up this situation. Is n't that what we call, " Mind your own business? " What? What did you say? Chill. I pass. eh? I ca n't join class reunion trip. I also start getting a job. No more easy going student. I am a Ronin... So I must study harder. I wish I were a Ronin, too. Sarcasm? No, that 's not it. Our household can not afford to have a Ronin student. I only have to go to a university that I really did not want to go. You are better... you can go to university, any way. There are some who can not go to universities due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, why not work and go to Night School? Stop talking like a king. You passed the 3rd class university. Why you get excited? Do n't be so happy, will you? 3rd class university? Stop it! Everyone has his own problems... There are some who could not advance to the track they wanted to take. You just show some considerations to those people. Consideration? Apparently, you have no problems. What?! Sympathy? No, that 's not it. Then, what? Uchii just worries about you. You understand? No I wo n't. Unlike Shin, I am not clever. Why do you have to say such a thing? You guys, stop this already. What do you want from quarreling? It 's bad to quarrel, is n't it? Yankumi might lose the job. A honor student is different from us. He thinks highly of teachers. Hey, Noda. Yankumi has nothing to do with us once we graduated. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own courses. That 's not tue. That is true. You are an elite and we are drop-outs. What 's it got to do with this? We are buddies, are n't we? Buddies? You are laughing at us, anyway. You think we are lower than you are. You 've been thinking that way. Yeah. That 's right. What are you doing? Stop it! Break, Break up! What are you doing? Break up, I say. Break up! Hey! Noda! Sawada! Stop it. What are you doing? Noda! What happened here? Nothing. Sawada! Shin! What had happened to them? Yamaguchi Sensei, a call for you. Thank you. Yes? Minami? Hey, Shin! What 's the matter? You are acting funny. I 'm sorry. Do you think they can understand how we feel? Buddies? What a lie! Damn! Ouch! Rent/Sales/Reform Inquite within. What are you doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @?! You are students of Shirokin High. So what? Help! Call police. I need the police. Hey. we got to run. Quickly! Why on earth, at this time? Police got involved. I 'm very sorry. They were a bit too hyperactive. They do n't make it a big issue as long as students show regrets. I 'll leave the rest to school. You need not come to school any more. Expelled? No, I wo n't expel them. I want them to be confined at home until they graduated. House arrest? If they can do so, I promise that they can graduate. Of course, They can not attend the ceremony. Vice Principal! We ca n't afford to have them go bad on that day. Wait a moment. As they can receive their diplomas. They must be thankful. I understand. I wo n't be coming. Hey, Noda. You... Let 's ask again to Vice Principal. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to beg the Vice Principal. You must attend the ceremony. Why the hell? What do I care? You 're right. We can graduate anyway. That 's not right. That 's not correct and you know it. You understand how much Yamaguchi Sensei worries about you. Your friends worried, too. Friends? What the hell is that? Minami gave up university. Why? He studied so hard to pass the exam. There was a phone call from him. His father 's company went bankrupt. I can feel how much shock he got from it. But his voice did not show it. Exactly the same as before. He is forward looking. I understand your feeling... You feel irritated... You have complaints, too. But there is no one in life who has no complaints. Everyone is equal. You are just 18. Exams or hunting jobs, which forces you to decide your future. But it is n't so easy like that. You shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go somewhere else, and come back again Is n't that how we live our lives? Is n't that how we find our own ideal lives? Please do n't give up so easily. Do n't run away from the hardships. Please do n't answer the most difficult question in life. Let 's go. Noda! Oishi! Shimazu! You shall go off track, struggle and then you stop, and go somewhere else, and come back again Is n't that how we live our lives? Ojyo 's students are lucky. What are you saying? As I am not so dependable, these things had happened. Ojyo, you still do n't understand. eh? If there is someone who shows concern, that person can live a straight life. Ojyo 's thinking or feelings do reach them. Your students can feel one 's kindness or pain. You may be right. Their hearts are well-built that way. Hello? Vice Principal... Yamaguchi Sensei, what is going on? Huh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keio. Sawada said what? Sawada! Vice Principal called me. He was very upset. Are you in trouble? No, but... You decided it by yourself. Any particular reasons? I 've been... uneasy and irritated lately.. eh? I hit Noda because of that. I 've been jealous about the others Yes! I am trying to get into Art Universities. In future, I want to build up my own brand. That 's my dream. I want to turn my restaurant into an Authentic Chinese Restaurant. In future, I 'll get an Architect License. Then, I can build your houses. My friends have their own dreams and yet, I realized that I had no dreams. Just to show disposition to my father, I studied and took exams. Last night, I apologized to my father for the first time. I wo n't attend universities. Please accept my decision. Then my father said OK. I was full of rebel-energy, but He accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good understanding father he is! Do you think so? What 's your plan after graduation? In Africa, there is a job opening to build an Elementary School. There is no pay, but Meals are to be provided 3 times a day. Other than that, there are... jobs to dig up wells, and many more, I heard. Volunteer work, I 'm sure. Nope. It 's less than that. At places I 've never been to, I want to try out something that I 've never done before. I see. There 's always a possibility that I might find things I really want to do for the rest of my life. Maybe not. I bet you can find it, As long as you look straight forward and keep on searching. I remember your words at that time, eh? Life is not so easy to decide. You never know how it turns out to be. You can try again and again. That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want. Sawada... But... Graduation Ceremony comes only once in life. I wish... With my buddies, I want to graduate together. Do you want to join me? Gladly. Students are still not in good terms with each other. Still that way. They say they are not attending the ceremony Is that so? A man is not so clever. A man just forgets what 's really important to him, Distracted by silly things. Silly things? Yeah. Disposition, appearance and something in that nature. And these stuffs are difficult to handle, One can not take them away by oneself. I could n't do so myself, either. eh? There would n't be a situation like this. I could n't agree to your mother 's wish of normal marriage. She disappeared from my sight. We could never see each other again. Kumiko... You must make sure your student must not go through what I had gone through. Grandpa... Thank you. Fight! Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wearing a Body Con Wear. What do you say? It 'll be scary to see Yankumi in Body Con Suit. Why scary? I look great in it. Coming to a Game Center is good, but Graduation Ceremony is much better. Fujiyama Sensei is gon na wear a mini skirt, I heard. You girls want to date us? We could n't get those girls. I got you. You fool. Wait a minute. I 'll teach you 100 successful ways to date girls, if you attend the Graduation Ceremony? I 'll be expecting you. You must come! We all graduate together. Tomorrow is the Graduation Ceremony. What 'll happen to 3-D? Matsudaira! eh? You... Why are you in a hurry? Well... I... I must be going. I am not hiding anything. So you are hiding something. Yes. If you need me for something, you must tell me so. We are kind of busy. I wanted to apologize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduation Ceremony, I want you to attend. Do n't call me for such a stupid thing. We want to graduate together. How long do you want to play buddies? We got tired of such kiddy stuff. Kiddy stuff? Stop it! We want to receive diplomas together. It does not really matter. We do n't wish to attend. Shut up. We all graduate together... Have n't we promised? That 's the last time we can be a member of 3-D. What do I care? I have other appointments. Cut it out. Shin, let 's leave it that way. No, we ca n't. Hey, you! What are you doing? Nothing. Hey, you. Stop right there. You think you are OK to be separated from other classmates? Like you ca n't communicate with each other Like bouncing balls, bouncing away from buddies Who cares? We are separated anyway. To you, a relationships with 3-D is that much only. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just? After graduation, we just say goodbye. That 's all there is to it. That 's not it, is n't it? Yankumi! Forget it. Everyone has his own mind. You... Every one is different, any way. A way of living is different. A way of thinking is different. We can not be in the same league any more. Noda... We were together in the same school for 3 years. That 's all. Buddies, Relationships... Do n't impose on us any more. Noda! These are your buddies, are n't they? Are n't these your buddies that you can trust? Because of your ego and disposition Are you really OK to lose the life long treasure? What do you say? What about you, then? Murata, when you were at the bottom, Everyone got together and solve your problem. When Sawada was deep in trouble, Everyone got together to back him up. When I was almost fired, You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there, I can be here as I am here today. We crawled up so many obstacles together. That 's... That 's what buddies are meant to be. I met Minami today. Why do you think he lied about Australia? His father 's company went bankrupt. He could not even think about a Graduation Trip. But he did not want us to worry, He wanted us to enjoy a Graduation Trip. You understand why he lied. Still you do n't understand this? You still do n't get it? He regards us as his important buddies. Minami is still thinking We all attend the Graduation Ceremony all together. You... Noda! Shut up! Tomorrow Is Your Graduation. Congratulations! WAKABA There is no way that I can attend the ceremony after all this. What 's up? eh? Graduation Ceremony Heisei 14( 2002) Shirokin High School Hey! Minami! Hey, you seem to gain weight again? They are not really coming... I 'm afraid so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am late. What on earth are you wearing? Do n't you know Today is a Graduation Ceremony? I 've been dealing with students like this for this past year. But Graduation Ceremony means... It really shows what Yamaguchi Sensei is all about. I bet students like this way. There is no need to dress up... just for Graduation Ceremony. Yankumi is Yankumi to students. Thank you. A Big Trouble! Hishiyama Construction Company called Uchiyama 's tentative job offer was revoked? Tentative job offer had been canceled? Why? The store they destroyed the signboard was a good customer of the company that offered me a job. What are you doing? They regard me as a member of the same gangs. Any graduates from Shirokin must be eliminated. Damn! I ca n't forgive them. Uchiyama Is that true? You knew it already, Yankumi. But do n't tell them anything, please. They may mind. If someone I do n't know had done it, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my buddies Yankumi! Where are you going? I can not let it go. Hey, you. Where are you going? Today 's the Graduation Ceremony. Kuma! Hishiyama Construction Company I beg you. Kindly not to cancel Uchiyama 's job offer. We did it. He has nothing to do with us. I can not accept it still. If he is a friend of such violent students, our customers regard him the same bunch. Thus, we had no choice. Though we are low life students, Uchiyama is different. He loves his parent more than anybody. He wants her mother to reduce her load of work. He says he would become a carpenter. He thinks of his buddies first. He does not talk well but he is a warm hearted guy. Please reconsider. Please. I beg you. I beg you. Today is your Graduation Ceremony, is n't it? How come you sneaked out? Because he is our buddy. Because we are buddies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Please reconsider. Please reconsider. Uchiyama 's future life depends upon this job. Please reconsider. Please reconsider. Please reconsider. Please reconsider. Finally at last, every single one had gathered. Uchiyama-kun, what 's the meaning of this? I 'll do my best. I wo n't give up any jobs no matter how difficult it may be. So kindly let me work for you. Please reconsider. Washio Sensei? Where is the Principal? He just disappeared. Where did he go? You win. Uchiyama-kun, I 'll depend on you. Yes. He did it! Uchii... Everyone... Hey, you! Now we head back to the Graduation Ceremony. They have not shown up yet. Principal! What are you doing out here? I thought we can wait a little bit more. No, we can not. It 's time we gave out diplomas. 3-A Hurry up or you wo n't make it! Congratulations on your graduation! 3-B 3-C Well... As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absent from the ceremony. They could n't make it in time. As such, We shall go on to the next program. Followed by What is the meaning of this? I 'm very sorry. Get out of here. Diplomas will be later... 3-D 3-D Yes. You stand in line. Quick! Hurry up! Graduation Ceremony Shirokin High School This is to certify that you had duly finished the course at this school. We, hereby, certify your graduation. March 07, Year of Heisei 15th( 2003) Shirakawa Genzo, Principal at Shirokin Gakuin High School Congratulations on your Graduation! Valedictorian 's Speech by Sawada Shin of 3-D. Sawada, read this. You have n't prepared anything good, I 'm sure. I can never trust teachers. Schools are all the same. That 's what I thought. I was wrong. Here at this school, There is only one, one and only though, that I could trust whole heartedly. Here, I found real buddies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly things, Together, we shed tears, There were buddies here. Instead of winning in fist fights, I 'd rather be beaten together. There were buddies here. I 'd like to be a life long buddy with them. Everyone goes on his way from today. That has no impact on me. We are buddies. Graduation gives me this much sadness... I did not know that. From tomorrow, I can not walk through the Shirokin 's Gate. I can not go to 3-D 's dirty class room. I can not hear Yankumi 's scolding voice. There would be no more... I feel really sad. Yet, I might meet various people. By meeting many people, We shall learn many things. These are very important factors in life. It is Yankumi who had taught us that way. Yankumi! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much! You... We hereby promise With a memory of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a pride of being Graduates of Shirokin High School, With all our might and desires, We look and live straight on this day forward. For these 3 years, We thank you very much. GOKUSEN Do n't cry. Do n't show tears. OK. We got you! She never learns. You... Blackboard : Grate Graduation!( should 've been Great Graduation!) Who can not learn already? Still Wrong Kanji. I feel terrible... What have they learned? Yankumi... I am afraid... I had... imposed the meaning of buddies... or Fist Fights... as if I knew everything in life. but every single move was a trial and error and I was not so confident on what I was doing Yet... You guys had taught me If I tackled the problems with all of my heart You could open your heart to respond. Like you..., something so undoubtedly straight... and so honest,... It might be rare to find, possibly I would face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why, I think... I was so blessed... to have you in my class. Whole heartedly, I think I was blessed to have you as my 1st students. Thank you, all. My term as your home-room teacher expires today. As a teacher, there is one thing I must tell you last. A buddy means... No matter how far you live apart, No matter how many years you could not see It 's a life long treasure. Cherish it. Never, ever forget about it. Yankumi, I decided to go to Night School, while working. Good luck, Minami. I 'll pass the Art College next year. I know you can do it, Noda. Come and eat my Ramen. Sure! Yours is a 4-star Ramen, Kuma. When you feel lonely, call me at any time. Make sure to take care of your Mom, Uchiyama. Yankumi, You said you could be our teacher up until today. You 'll be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... All together, Greetings! So long, you guys! Come and show your face some time. See you! Sayonara! Genkidena!( Genkidena=Takecare) Bye... I hope you enjoyed Gokusen Special so far. If you laughed a little, shed some tears here and there, my task was completed. Enjoy the rest of the show. Kumiko! Old Japanese customs-Striking 2 pebble stones 3 times behind one 's back to get rid of bad fortune on special occasions. Wait a minute. I 'll be off to school. Take care. A new semester begins today. Yes. I wonder what kind of students are coming this time. Looking forward to meeting them? Yes, very much. Kumiko-san! Should you need anything, Just remember that I am always beside you... Do n't forget about it... Shinohara-san, How about going to the movies with me? Sure. I 'd love to. Really? Now that I, Sawatari, became a principal, We must make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UP, The ratio of acceptance at national and famous private universities are going UP Up Up... so noisy. You are in charge of the Senior Class this year. I feel pain in my stomach since I woke up. I found a cute boy in the freshman class. You are too quick. You two should tone down. Yamaguchi Sensei, Are you listening? Yes, I was... I 'm sorry. Fight! Oh! Good morning. Attention! Silence! Ca n't you hear what I just said?! Listen. Listen good! When someone is talking, you be silent and listen to him. That 's the etiquette. For 3 years from today, I 'll take good care of you. No matter what. I 'll lead you. I 'll make sure that All will graduate together. Well, then, Let 's begin our lesson. This drama is fictitious and bears no resemblances( exceptfornames) to any real person. END
