5212041 - I need a doctor! - I 'll get you a vet, you son of a bitch! You should have shot him first. We have two clowns headed south on Route 51 and 4 miles from the border. And stop bleeding ' on the money! All units be advised : suspects are armed and are dangerous. What the fuck... Well, hello, boys and girls. There 's nothing worse than a sad clown. Unless it 's a clown bleeding internally, and coughing it all over your money. Well, I suppose a summer vacation with a big haul south of the border was out of the question now. But like my old mother always told me Fuck off, Loser! Damn! - Holy shit! - The circus came to town! - Vasquez... tell you what, we 'll take care of this. - You better! You know the paperwork involved. - We 'll say they landed on your side, okay? - No problem. Commander. - We might have to book them ourselves. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not the way I see it, Bill, they 're on Mexican soil. You 're a piece of shit, Vasquez! There 's no way you 're taking ' these clowns! You 're not in a position to bargain. I paid for our little arrangement every second Tuesday of the month, to... Fuck you, Vasquez, you thinking ' about blowing ' the whistle on me or something, huh? Yeah! If I need to. - Is that a threat, Capron? - Look. you 're corrupt, we 're corrupt. There is one difference... we are honest about it. You 'd best bury them in that god damned I do n't give a fuck slap on the wrist beanery system in your... You win, Bill, you wo n't be hearing from them again. Hey! What did they do? Rob a bank? You figure it out, Genius! Come. - What 's your name? - I 'm Bozo, he 's Frosty with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dennis? Ah! Fuck! Ruben? Do n't worry, we 'll give him a nice burial, relieve you of your money troubles and find you a nice place. You 'll be happy there. Ah! Prison! I lucked out, it could a been a hole in the desert. And since I did n't have any cash, I guess they were forced to charge me. God only knew where my cash was, but at least I knew who had it. That 's been playing for six fucking hours. Tortured by the Mariachi. Ah, what 's this? Oh! Inmates with guns... now that 's kind of new. I got a lot to learn about this place. Dancing with the Stars... I see. Get your mind right, soften you up in a whole new cell with loud music, deprive you of sleep. Oh, well, I guess I was going to have to take my lumps sooner or later. - Shoes? - Huh? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have really small feet and these are size 11. Ah! Fucking ' ouch! Jack, you work too hard. The consulate is closed. I just came to pick up the files. I think you may be forgetting to report an American citizen, that 's a serious offense, Armando. Honest mistake, Jack. Come see me tomorrow, we 'll sort it out. Oh, boy! 5000 songs or so later we were let out of the holding cell. and transferred to the general prison populace. Now, I 've been in the joint before, but this was kind of different. Is this a prison or the world 's shittiest mall? If I was going to survive in this place, it was time to do what I was good at. Anyway... I was outta cigarettes. Holy Rolex! Shit! Thank you. Well, it was bed time at El Pueblito. It looked like all the good pieces of dirt were taken. Ya know, ya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pinch on you. Somebody was running this place... and it was n't the Warden. Now he looks like Somebody... people showing ' him respect. Yeah, he 's Somebody... he 's yelling ' at people. Though the little guy in the Bad-Taste clothes is working for ' I 'm, because he 's making his life miserable. And the... Wait a minute!. 12 o'clock! Guy in a bathrobe, in the Penthouse. Well, he must be El Hefner! No, no! Those two guys are both working for him. He does n't even have to get dressed and he 's making BOTH their lives miserable. We need a bathrobe like that! I had to improve my social standing around here. It was simple, really. Two bits bought you a day off work so you could focus on doing a real job. Need some heroin? Make tracks to the Smack Shack, where business was always booming. You got a cigarette? Yeah. Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? - 18! - Get lost! - I 'm 10, can I have one now? - No! You probably want me to keep my mouth shut. When Manolo 's taco stand caught on fire, and Rodrigo, the doctor, says there 's some misplaced cash, - when I talk, the shit 's really going to hit the fan. - Cigarette? Light? - So, you 're a Watcher? - You learn a lot from watching. - What are you in here for? - Very funny! - I 'm only 10, Man, my father was a dealer. - He was? Yeah, I live here with my mom. You speak pretty good English, Kid, where did ya learn. Sesame Street? What 's with all the school kids going ' back and forth all the time? If you 're not a inmate, you 're free to go in and out. - What! They live here? - Yeah! If you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live with you. - While you 're serving time. - That 's a new one! - How come you do n't go to school? - I 'm special. Yeah! How ya special? Most Gringos are in worse shape after a few days in El Pueblito. - Some vacation, huh? - I bet you 'd like one of these. - Oh! Would I! - Oh, yeah! Well, your... your file does n't have a name, do you have a name? Yes, Richard Johnson. Dick Johnson, huh? It 's unfortunate. Anybody I can contact for you, Dick? Wife, sweetheart, - No! - boyfriend? - No. - I did n't think so. Says here you were caught buying valium in a drugstore downtown without a prescription. That does n't quite fit... What 're you doing in here? You 're right, it does n't fit, that is bullshit. They 're making this up! Two cops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I ended up in here. - You got to get me outta here. - Just misunderstood, huh? Yes! That 's right. You do n't have any fingerprints. A guy who burns off his fingerprints is a career man, even I know that much. - Are you going to get me out of here or not? - Seems to me somebody 's trying to bury you in here. No shit. Sherlock! What do YOU want? I mean, maybe I can help YOU? Like I said, I ca n't help you without any information... You 're not giving me any information! You spring me outta here, I 'll give you plenty! You know, it 's... it 's a lot easier to end up dead in here, than to survive... A Gringo without money in a South-of-the-Border jail. Nah! It 's not so bad... you know. At least it 's a shithole. All right! You 're not going to tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can respect that! But I will find the truth out for myself, ya know. I know even a blind pig has to find and acorn now and then. You called me fat. Be careful, My Friend, you 'll hurt my feelings. Let me tell you something '. There 's a little, skinny guy inside o ' me. And you know what that guys is saying? He 's saying ' something ' stinks about you. And I 'm going to find out what it is. - Nice meeting you. - You, too, thanks for coming by. - Yeah, do n't sweat too much. - Aw, I never do. The Ugly American... I thought it was me until he turned up. I did n't like him sniffing ' around my business. - Hey! You speak English? - Yeah! I 'm looking for a place to live and you look like the guy that knows. Real estate is a high commodity. What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are! Nothing special! There is a common bathroom for ten on the south side TV and cable are additional if you want it. Fan, blanket and towel are complimentary. Welcome. Perfect! Well, this must be Cell Block A. Gives a whole new main ' to doing ' " Hard Time ". A special wing for special inmates. I guess you had to know someone to get in. What the FUCK are you looking at? Fuck! Okay, so escaping is frowned upon. It 's harder than it looks, Handsome... breaking out. I do n't know, it looks pretty easy to me. You can buy anything in El Pueblito... except your way out. - Even Java has to come back when he goes out. - Who 's Java? He runs the Joint. He lives up there, where the rich people live. Ah, the guy with the cheesy bathrobe and the cell phone. - Yeah! Cigarette? - No! What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... dinner, soccer matches, whatever. But even HE has to come back. Wow! He 's really got a good thing going for him in here. Oh, yeah! He 's going to die, the worthless asshole! - Hum? - I 'm going to kill him. - Okay! Why? What did he ever do to you? - It 's personal. - Oh, remind me to never rub YOU the wrong way. - Cigarette? - No, Kid, your mother has a vicious right! - She asleep! - She worked late last night. - Yeah, I know. What does she do? She works for Java. Last night was Casino Night. - Hey! Who are those two guys? - Ren and Stimpy? The big guy, Caracas, - that 's Javi 's brother. - What about the little real estate cat? Carnal? He 's a cousin. He 's a useless prick. Even they hate him. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they took blood from me, I 'm figuring it 's not a health thing. No shit! Can I have a cigarette, for fuck 's sake? You know, the other day, you told me you were special. - How are you special? How are you special? - Fuck you! You 're so special, get your own fucking ' cigarettes. Quit mooching ' off me, I 've got a 40 year habit, get lost! Ah! Sunday. Visiting Day at El Pueblito. Bring the whole family to crapiest place on earth. Enjoy out ever popular, world famous, cavity search. At twenty bucks a pop, they were making ' a killing. Hey, Kid, that 's more than a toothpick you got there? - What 's your plan? - Stab him in the heart. Oh! It 's the aorta, the human cava. Those are pretty deep blood vessels, chances are you 'd miss. - How about the stomach? - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. A quick treatment 's probably save his life. - The neck? - Yeah, good thinking ', the carotid. Now, too high for you, Kid, you 'd need a ladder. Typically, if you want to kill someone instantaneously you go for the central nervous system or the brain. Lights out. Can I have a smoke? I really need one. No. Not until you tell me why you 're so special around here. - Fuck, you ca n't touch me! - Why? If I do this, these guys are going to kill me? - You 're holding out on me, Kid, spit it out! - Fuck you, you fuck! Just knock it off! Is that guy Java is your father? Is that 's why they protect her, huh? You 're a mosquito! Sit the fuck down! A man who wo n't level with you, that 's a man you ca n't trust. You do n't ever talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed my father. I was seven when I came to live here. My parents were doing 15... drug trafficking. Java needed a new liver, and my dad was a perfect match. Same rare blood type. He has my father 's liver. I want to cut it out of him and bury it with my dad. Okay But what 's the deal with you? - He 's going to need another liver. - Fuck! Marked as you ARE... special. That 's why they took my blood. - Bingo, Gringo. They test everyone, but I 'm the only match. I got put on the Inside at 14. I tried to fuck-up somebody I really hated... my dad. I wish someone would a killed him, I would a given him a cigar! He 'd been beating ' up on my mom... the 3rd time that week I snapped finally and went to work on him with a baseball bat. The only mistake I made? I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Shitter the first time. So, ya got to be careful, Kid. If you 're going to do this thing, do it right, otherwise they 'll fry your balls off. And although you 're not using ' em at the moment, trust me, someday soon you 're going to want those puppies working '! You do n't want to kill Java. You NEED to kill Java... before he kills YOU. Here, look at this. I was a sniper. Snipers work in two-man teams. - I need a spotter, you know, for the gig. - Why, you going to shoot him? It 's not about that, it 's about watching and waiting. We 'll see, we 'll get ' I 'm. Yeah, fuckers live too long. Come here. What did ya find out? Hey, fellas! Who the fuck are you? I 'm with the U.S. Consulate in Tijuana... really. - Are you a cop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. - So, what do you want? No, what do you want? The man who drove this car or the guys who 're spending the money? Both. One-stop shopping, welcome to Costco. - Yeah, here 's my membership card. - Aw, come on. take it easy, Cowboy. All I want is the joy of seeing justice done, it 'll be for the right price, I 'm not greedy. Hell, I 'll get you a picture. I 'll take it to him... personally. Huh? How do you like them apples? That 's Magno, he 's running in 4th. There 's no way he can beat Blue Demon Junior... he 's a champion. For him, it 's... Tzaltar 's like the best. They 're like the shit. Man. Before my dad got locked away we were supposed to see this match. Hey, give me that, you... you got to knock this shit off, Kid. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here, get yourself an ice cream. - All right! Thanks! - Bring me back the change. - Hey! - Hey! Play the money? Well, ya know, he worries too much, and he needs to be a kid for a while. Why, you going to hit me again? He does worry too much. Today he looks happy. He talks about you, told me about your dad, and how you talked him out off something stupid. - That 's not easy. - No, he 's smart, he listens. - He does n't talk to many people. - No. Want a beer? Okay. Oh! I have a visitor. I 'm sorry. I 'll take you up on that beer later. Thank you. Well, howdy, Buckaroos! You all! You look sharp! Thank you for your financial contribution to our families. Do n't mention it. We took care of Frosty, by the way. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Oh, I did n't know him that well. We have a serious problem. Is this something I can help you with? Well, the thing is, two of the cops who were with us when we first met, turn up dead. Cops die all the time, it 's part of the trade. What is troubling is the fact, they were tortured. Badly! So, we wanted to ask you where you got the money. We are just concerned that someone might be looking for you. - And of they are, we need to know who it is. - I see. Two million bucks is a lot of money. Two million dollars is a lot of money, you 're right. Why, it says here they were found in a brand new Mercedes. Which model was it? Listen! Things can get better or worse for you in here. Well, let me guess, you got friends in here, too. Well, I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean, he knows about the money you stole from me, huh? - I mean, you gave him his cut, right? - Listen, you fucking Gringo. You may think you have this BS figured out, but you do n't know shit! - Just tell us where you got the money. - I 'll tell you what... Whoever tortured those cops, surely knows you 're in here. If you tell us, we could help. Because otherwise, it 's just a matter of time before they come get you. I know. You 're right! And... and here 's the thing, and I 'm sure the two of you will agree with me... they 'll be coming to get you two first, so here 's my advice, Stop spending my fucking ' money, put it someplace safe and then go and hide yourselves, okay? Because when they find you, they will kill you, and then I 'll never get my damn money. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Yeah! Take it easy out there. You 're have no idea who we are. You 're Vasquez, badge No. 9-0-3-4-8-9, and you 're Romero, badge No. 1... Ah! Fuck it! - Ya ever been fishing? - Never been outta the Joint. No? Well, you got a treat in store with a scheme like this. There he is. You know what to do, divide and conquer. Sorry. Bang, bang. - Heart shot. - Yeah, well, you spot, I 'll shoot, come here. We did better than I thought. Here, here 's your cut. - Here, I got these for you, too. - What is it? - Nicotine gum. - What 's it do? Stops the craving. Do n't flash it around, do n't spend it in big chunks, that 's how you get bonged, okay? Hey! How about that beer now? - Now? Twist my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you. I was a user, that 's how we met. Then I help him out cutting the shit, packing it. We got busted with 3 kilos. - Cup of ginger? - Thank you. At least I got cleaned-up in here. You got a cigarette? - Yeah, you remind me of someone. - Yes. If you tell him, I 'll kick your ass. - Again? - Worse! Where is he? Is he around? - I think he went for a beer. - What? Oh, you bum! - So, are... you married? - Easy, Mamacita, you 're moving a little fast. It 's a very sensitive subject for me, I... I was. She ran-off with a former business associate of mine, one Reginald T. Barnes. We were doing a job, I got away, he got caught. He ratted me out for immunity, and I did seven years in the Slammer. She ended-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? You know, I still have recurring dreams about it. Yeah... there 's a knock on the door, Reginald 's opens it he 's wearing ' underpants and eating a bowl of corn flakes, weird, huh? Yeah, not a pretty sight, there 's milk spilling ' down his chin and shit. and my wife 's making ' coffee over behind him. And these two goons at the door whip-out these massive canons and guh-guh, guh-guh, guh they start filling ' begin his chest full of holes, He hits the floor, dead as a mackerel, she drops the coffee and starts screaming ' her ass off. And then? Then I wake up. - The resentment will kill us all. - But them first! Well, here 's to resentment. - I know you know about the liver. - I know. - How rare can blood be? - Very. It 's called " Bambi Blood ", one in half a million. - And Java @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son. I never know when they 'll come for him. Yeah, well, we 're not going to let that happen. Are we? Caracas... I saved your brother 's life. I saved your life, too, I protected the Kid and the liver. Terminated two troublesome employees. Do n't tell me you were n't thinking about killing him already. I saved you the embarrassment of having family blood on your hands. And if he was willing to kill your brother, he was coming ' to kill you next, in about a minute and a half, to be precise.. So, I saved your fucking ' life twice. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Okay, okay, give me a minute, I got to change my shorts. Got to wait! Which one? Yep! Hey there! - Oh, hey, Butter Balls. - Yeah, " Butter Balls ". Just checking ' - in, wanted to see how ya were doing '. Fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see you 're still hanging ' in there, so... So... I know there 's money, I can still help you out, all I want is a piece of the pie. Talkative as ever, but that 's okay. Say, it was nice knowing ' ya. Sorry, if we got off on the wrong foot. Good luck, then, you 're going to need it. Butter Balls was putting ' the squeeze on me, sooner than I thought. It was time to play a card I 'd been holding back. Trying ' to get my cash a little closer. Good day. What do you want? I have some information for you that you might find valuable. Two cops, Vazquez and Romero, badge number 9-0-3-4-8-9... - We know our cops. - Oh! You know them? Well! In that case, you 'll find this really interesting. They took a sizeable amount of money from me when they brought me here and I figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder if they gave you your cut. - What? - What 's in it for you? Nothing ' now, probably since I told you, but I... look, I think a finder 's fee would be fair. - How much? - Oh, I do n't need much, 10% maybe... okay, 8. - How much money? - Oh... You know, I only stole it, I did n't have time to count it... but, I... ballpark? 10 million, maybe a little more. You know what will happen if you are pushing my leg? Yeah, I know, I know. I would n't push your leg. See you later. The Boss rejects it... one million seven. - Where the fuck 's the rest? - I... I swear to God, that 's all there was. - That 's bullshit. - No bullshit! It 's true. Hello, can you see me? Uh... yeah, Boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all there? No, there 's only one point seven and a couple new cars out front. - Where 's the rest? - It 's all there... except for what we spent. - The cars, some hookers... - We bought them shoes and tacos, that 's all. - Friends, where is the rest of my money? - That 's all there was. Talk to the gringo that stole it. - Cut the toe off. - But... we already did that, Boss, two of ' em. - Cut another off. - No, please. I swear. That 's all there was. Mr. Vasquez, listen very carefully. You see, I 'm missing four million dollars, you 're missing three toes, so far. I 'll give you a moment to do the arithmetic, then it 's up to you if you want to talk. - What did he say? - He said what does " ritmaticks " mean. Ah, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! Hey! No! No! No! Hey! - I swear! No! Please! - There were only two! - Last chance, Vasquez. - No! Do n't! Do n't! No! - I swear, - Are you sure? I Swear! Who the fuck are you? Hey! That 's my money! Java. Java, you motherfucker, I 'm going to fucking ' kill ya! Ah, Jesus! I 'm going to kill ya, Java, with my own fucking ' hands. - You Buffet? - You got it. If you 're hungry, try the fish tacos, it 's their specialty. There 's something coming ' down to me and I do n't want you two to get caught in the middle of it, so... - So, if you do n't see me for a week... - Okay. There is something you 're not telling us. This gun belonged to Doroteo Arango. Do you know who he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead, because you have his gun. He was better known as Pancho Villa. This is the same gun he fired in The Opera Restaurant in Mexico City. - Have you ever been there? - No. The hole 's still there in the ceiling. They auctioned this gun off a few years ago in the States, they thought that was the original. During the revolution there was a shortage of bullets, and Pancho was well aware of that, so he made sure that every bullet counted. - Who the fuck are you? - If you really need a name, it 's Barnes, Reginald T. And I 'm sorry about the mess, I did n't mean... You 've been spending time with the Kid and his mother... Keep away from them, and this is the last warning you 'll get.. - What name? - Barnes... Reginald T. Barnes. Java... - Welcome to the United States. - Hey. - What 's your citizenship? - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Chicago, Illinois. Good morning, Warren Kaufmann 's office. Oh! Ah!
