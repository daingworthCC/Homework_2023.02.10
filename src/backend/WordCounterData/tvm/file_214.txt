He 'll be okay. Kelly, I wish I knew you were stopping by. I told dad I was coming. What are all you people doing in my office? Sir, you have n't been in this office for seven years. Hi, Jules. Give your father a hug. Ben can return in limited capacity overseeing your career. So, the first time he gets high, starts disrobing... brandishes a gun or any other lethal weapon, he 's out. There used to be trust and respect between us, Eddie. If I decide to help you, I expect that to be restored. I 'll do any job you have. Eddie, bring your medical gear. She needs a transfusion. - No. No hospital. I want justice for this girl. How did you meet her? A car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where did you sleep with her? In her car.

What are you doing? - You ever gon na talk to me again? This is not the time or the place. - Yeah... You 're not returning my calls, you wo n't let me see the boys... what the fuck else am I supposed to do? I 'm working, there are children here. I understand. Hey, guys. Just officer Friendly, you know, trying to be friendly to Mrs. Battaglia here. Yeah, get off! - No! I have to take these kids to school, they 're gon na be late. It 's alright. - Kenny. Nobody is going anywhere until you talk to me. You are such a bully. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into my life? Fucking bullshit, Amy, alright? I 'm your husband and I 'm sorry. I said it a hundred times. I 'll say a hundred more! How many more times can I apologize? - Until she forgives you. You know what, kid. Just a second. Fine. Six pm tonight. Okay. Thank you. Can I have the goddamn key? Hey, remember, kids. Do n't do drugs, alright. Be there. Ooh, careful, boys. I got those from the old Stardust theatre in Baton Rouge. Ben! What are you doing? I 'm creating an environment. In which to do some very important work. Hey, you immerse yourself in beauty, you 're one step closer to creating it yourself. Good luck selling this to accounting. You have a meeting this evening, Ben. With the board of directors. I do? - No big deal, it 's just You 're getting nervous. They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you changed, but they are at Defcon 5. They 're very skittish morons. They 're fascinated that you 're interested in breaking out new artists like Panic here, and they 'd like to hear how exactly you intend to make that happen. Along with all your other plans for the company. I am sorry, to spring this on you last minute. If there 's anything I can do to help, you just let me know. You 're my father, and I love you. As Regan loved King Lear. Do n't you mean Cordelia? Is my sperm glorious, or what? Come on, man. That 's nasty. But true. What are we gon na do, man? What is your master plan? Do you really have one? The only master I have is in Heaven, but if you give me a fucking minute to think, here... I ca n't fucking work here. It 's too stuffy in here, look at those fucking drapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, let 's go out in the fucking streets, man. Come on, let 's go! Get in the street! I want my lawyer. Now. He 's not in there? Nope. He 's not in there. Check your pockets. Wait, you ca n't, you 've got cuffs on. I thought you were one of those guys who gets what he wants, when he wants it. But it 's a new day. Take a seat. What 's Park doing here? Well, he raped a young girl. Why is Cooper working it? This is our shop. - I do n't know. Maybe it 's connected to your shooting? I 've been working a case against Park for nine months. Narcotic distribution, human trafficking, money launder... I have a C.I. that took me forever to develop. He could be killed because of this. I did n't know you were working... This bucket head is the key to my case in K-town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up. Keep an eye on this before he kills my case. Please. Okay. Anything you need. Put these on and come with me, amigo. So, how long you 've been here? A few days. From Guatemala. Coyote bring you over as well? I made it on my own. Wow. Are you the boss? No, I 'm just a captain. I 've been here the longest. I just get paid, you know, for driving the cars out. So I have a job? - Yeah. Come on. Just remember... Pretend you do n't speak English. When you call a customer, hold the keys tight. Keep drying spots till you see money. If they start making demands, just say " No habla Ingles ". And what if they do n't speak Espanish? No, home, believe me, all Americans understand this. Ah, that 's just great. I ca n't wait to tell the boys about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's good, right? - Kenny, get the fuck off me. Get off me, Kenny! You 're not even convincing yourself. What are you doing? Come on. - Just stop. I 've had better sex with vegetables. Oh, wow. - This is just not dangerous anymore. It 's just boring. It 's boring? What, you want me to grab the cuffs, huh? No, just, uh, wake the fuck up or something. The most attractive thing about you was your wedding ring. Be a minute. - Take two. Hey, everything alright? - Peachy. So, listen, we still on for tonight? You know, I was thinking maybe we could grab a couple of steaks, we throw them on the grill... Kenny... This is n't a date. Yeah, alright. It 's alright. I get it. You do n't get it. What? What is it that you want me to get? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenny... But, I want a counselor present. What kind of counselor? A marriage counselor. What the fuck? Get out of here. Are you crazy? We have a lot to talk through, you said so yourself... and I do n't want to get caught up in accusations and emotions. You wan na put me in front of some stranger? Two against one? I mean, talk about how I mistreated you? How I 'm the demon and you are the martyr? I mean, fuck that. I mean... How is that going to help? It helps because, no counselor, no meeting. Yeah, well, we 've never needed one before. Think about what you just said. Alright, fine. Fine, but no one can know that we 're seeing a shrink, okay? Well, I 'm willing to go through behavioral sciences at the department. Oh, man. I made a couple of calls, your benefits cover it. What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! Amy, you know cops, alright? They smell one tiny weakness... I mean, you put my job on the line. Well, all the more reason to go and get it over with. But, it 's up to you. Fine. Alright, you happy? Fine. They can see us at six. Do n't be late. That was the wife. She wants us to go to marriage counseling. Really? - Yeah. You know, talk about our feelings, our problems. Group hug. Very married. You know, very unavailable to any other woman. My client is highly regarded in the Korean community. A line of people waiting to testify on his behalf will be a testament to that. And after they find out what he did to that little girl? All you have is the allegations of a fourteen year old girl. Thirteen. She 's thirteen. You pay him? Whatever the age is, the allegations are totally false. Imitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat. You wan na know why? It looks like crab meat. They even put that red shit, uhm, who the fuck knows what it is... Probably dye number, whatever the fuck it is. Either way, you know it 's not good for you. Is there a point here, detective? It even tastes like crab meat. That is, if you do n't know what crab meat is supposed to taste like. Now, I know what crab meat tastes like. So it pisses me off. When they try to pass that fake white shit of and expect me to enjoy it. As interesting as you may find yourself, I can assure you that no one else does. You walk like you care about Korea town, you even talk a good game. You 're imitation crab meat. You are a fake piece of white shit. With a red line down your back. You help young girls come to this country with hopes of helping their poor families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm to your community than the fucking communism in the north ever could. Here it is, here 's the bill of shit. I want him. Okay. Detective. What 's going on? Oh. Who 's asking? You, or your boyfriend? I 'm asking. Look, I know you 've got a hard on for Axel, but I wan na make sure that Parks pays for what he did to that little girl. Yeah, I got him. He 's gon na get it. I need a little bit more time. What, you think I 'll let a pedophile back out on the street? Well, I would never let that asshole back out there, he sickens me. I 'll make sure he hears hello Frisco every morning for the rest of his fucking life. Okay? Christine Emory? - Yes. Emily Muriel, Santa Barbara Sheriff 's Department. I 'm here about your husband. Why do n't you come in? Sorry the place is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ma'am, we found your husbands ' car. It appears to be abandoned. Where? Cold Springs Bridge. Santa Ynez valley, wine country. And we found this inside. What is it? It 's a suicide note, Mrs. Emory. God. The confusing thing is, we have n't found a body. I do n't understand. It 's a 220 foot drop into a wooded ravine. We 've got search parties down there round the clock, but so far nothing. What are you saying? In 44 cases, we 've found 44 bodies. It 's possible, since your husband was experiencing financial difficulties and he is a suspect in the Antelope Valley arson... What, that he faked his suicide? When was the last time you had contact with him? Are you accusing me of something? It 's just a question, ma'am. I have n't heard from him since the day he left. You do n't want to get yourself involved, in something like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband, do yourself a favor, call. I need inspiration. This is how I did it with Billy Joel. Fucking Cold Spring Harbor. You wan na bounce some ideas off me? They 're still marinating. You have n't mentioned anything. Well, it 's not exactly like we 're married. I do n't share everything with you. But there is a reason the music industry is dead. There 's no new ideas on how to sell. There 's new formats. There 's new ways for people to steal songs. But there 's no new plan to convince people that they have to have what we have. It 's a nice job, little man. Here you go. Yo, chill out, dog, I 'm gon na tip you. No habla Ingles. You better hurry up and learn. You 're gon na be shit out of luck. He 's probably only been here two days and he already knows that blacks do n't tip. You better give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regard, kid. You see, he 's probably gone all the way from Guatemala... maybe El Salvador, but certainly, he 's more Mayan than European. Look at that, look at those noble features. Salt of the Earth. You have no idea what his people suffered to get here. Unlike my people, who came over in chains on a ship. Yeah, but look at you, you 're driving a big stretch limo and he 's wiping it down for you. And you 're riding in the back. Hey, it 's Darwin at work. Young man, I do n't know what it is, I do n't know the answer, but you 've got something. You clearly need to come with us. Uh, no habla Ingles. What are you doing? You know how you 're always want answers and you 're always breaking my balls... Paco here has the smarts enough to keep his mouth shut. Here 's five big ones, buddy. For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not gon na try to fuck you, man. We 're in the music business. Come on. This is a good thing for you. Could n't have picked a bridge over water? You have no idea what happened. Maybe his body is stuck in a tree somewhere, or, carried off by a wild animal. He could n't even burn down his own housing development. The man fails at every single thing he sets his mind to. He got you. I was pregnant. Was n't that hard. You never believed in him. I mean, look at... You do n't even believe he 's dead. I need to end this. I need to get out, start over, find some kind of life for myself. What would you do? Get a job. Sell the house. The house is a mess, nobody 's gon na buy it like this. I 'll fix it up. I 'll sell it for half price in Brentwood. Trust me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started this was to take care of dad. Right. And, now that I 'm not gon na be here, I need you to take care of him. No. No way. What, I ca n't be around him anymore. What, and you 're just realizing this? No! Neal would never let us move him into the house. No. Do you know what he said to me this morning? He told me that his life is a failure because he never taught me how to be happy. Well, he did n't mean that. I was a good daughter, a dutiful wife and now I 'm alone. committed suicide or faked his death to get away from me. And my father tells me his life is meaningless because I do n't know how to be happy. I got ta figure out how to live with all that. Either escape, like Peter did. Or figure out what I should 've been doing all along. Chris, what Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to take care of myself. And Megan. We arrested Park. He 's in our custody right now. Good. Yeah, but it feels like this case has a potential to fall apart. Oh. He molested a little girl who 's already identified him. We need to throw everything we can at him. Which is why I want you to come down and make a statement to ensure he gets locked up. You told me the girl would be enough. I ca n't have this fall back on my family. My grandmother is sick, my father has a business. He 's too easy to find. Work with me on this and I 'll make sure that they get into protective custody. They ca n't leave Korea town. And now they ca n't live there. You told me you wanted justice for this little girl. - I do. So grow some hair on your Asian balls and man up for Christ 's sake. Fuck you! Look, your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little girls ' hospital room. And your family is already in danger. And so is Ji Sun. You need to follow through with this. That 's the only way to guarantee that Park goes away and that everyone stays safe. What 's up? The meeting 's not for a few hours. Yeah, I 'm just checking in. Concerned about my dad. He really ca n't afford another embarrassment. No, it 's all good, he 's he 's got a lot of ideas. So, what are you guys doing? Buying fruit. So he has nothing. I 'm surprised you 're not at a titty bar. You know what would be so helpful? If you could call me every hour, keep me posted. Where he goes, who he meets with, what they say. We really need to make sure he stays focused. You 're asking me to snitch, Ben 's my boy, I ca n't do that. Can you honestly tell me you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben 's promise of one? But hey, if you feel totally secure in Ben 's hands, then by all means, dump all your eggs in that basket and do n't answer my calls. Alright, well, what do you suggest? Give him a plum cod. He loves those. You ready to go? We got ta pull our shit together, man. You call this a peach, huh? Look, here, try this. Ah, a plum cod. A genetic abomination. Should n't you be calling like, Madonna or something? Does she like fruit? No, I mean the relationships that you have, man. Can you call favors in? Now this is fucking embarrassing. Do n't you see what 's happening here? Jules is setting you up. Making sure you make an ass of yourself in front of the board, so they can fire you and then her hands are clean. Yeah, I see that. Uhuh. When in doubt, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, let 's go look at some titties. Uh, hemorrhage? - Yeah. Is that it? One more thing. What do you know about this? Anything. What does this have to do with the molestations case? It was part of it. I 'm just trying to find out if you 've ever seen these two guys together. Sorry, detective. Are you sure? Hey, I 'm just fucking with you. You do know these two guys though, right? That 's Mr. Park and he 's a detective in this division. And you do n't know his name? My bad. I 'm sorry I kept you longer than officer Arcel promised, I 'm just... having a hard time dealing with the fact, that... you 've never seen these two guys together, as much as you used to run the streets of K-town. Guess I 'll take your word for it. Thanks for coming down to help us, though. You 're gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm. Could n't matter if she cries, screams, yells. You 're her rock. Oh, God. Hey! Look at me. Do n't mention my name, okay, that makes me real. Talk about the good times, put those pictures in her head. High school sweetheart, first date, prom. Oh, come on. You got ta be... - Do n't argue. Look at me. Just listen. Let her know she 's been heard. That 's what women want. Now get out. What are you talking about, get back here. Out. You ca n't leave me like this. Oh, yes I can. Oh, you 're cruel. Oh, you 're a fucking... You 're gon na go in there minding your wife and show her you mean it. Alright. Detective Finet. Hey. Wow! That 's some shirt. I tried one of these shirts like those, they never seem to fit me right. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too small or do you just wash them in really hot water? This room is for interrogations, you can use the..... room to figure out the word for 10 across, huh. What are you doing here? With detective Finet? His client wants to make a statement. It 's some case regarding Mr. Park. Something about a girl. I thought you represented Mr. Park. I represent many people in the Korean community, detective. Hey, detective, do you mind if I sit in on this interrogation? Mind? I actually prefer it, detective. Come on in. You Kenny Battaglia? Yeah, you doctor Zack? No, I 'm detective Gill. We need to take you into custody. For what? Making criminal threats, unlawful detention. Unlawful det... Kidnapping? Yeah. Did you hold up a school bus this morning and then refused to let anyone go? Oh, come on. You know what, I was just talking to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complaint. - She did what? Nice, so, this is all a setup? There 's no shrink? Come on, let 's go. - Alright, I 'm going with you. Is this necessary? You know what, man? I did n't hurt anyone. Alright, this is just a marital spat. Come on, buddy. Jesus Christ. Nothing. I 've got nothing. No ideas. No erection. We 're running out of time, Ben. Anthony... I have searched the breath of this world. And try as I might, I 'm sorry to say... that you have bet on the wrong fucking horse. You ca n't even put me out to pasture. Come on, girls. I think I have an idea. I raped that little girl. Ji Sun. It was me. Look, the girl already IDed someone else. No one else was involved. I brought over Ji Sun from Korea, against her will. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke. The girl got it wrong? Does n't know who raped her? It gives more than reasonable doubt to the Park case. Yeah. Take him to lockup. And get his statement down, and signed. Motherfucker! - Ah! What the fuck! - Get off me! I 'm gon na help you solve a case and that 's the thanks you get? This is n't about solving shit! - It 's my job. You fucked my case! If you were a better detective, you would 've solved it yourself! I 've got a witness against Park. Oh, please, a thirteen year old abused girl who does n't speak English? You think this is over, do n't you, huh? - Hey, why do n't you hit the bar, pal? And do a few lines of blow while you 're at it? Cause that 's what you do best. Let me tell you something. Working narcotics cost me a lot. It cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My kids. And through it all, no matter how far I fell, I never, Officer, I never compromised my duty. As a police officer. Now, can you say that? I do n't think so. Enjoy your freedom, motherfucker. You need an espresso, Ben? I know you 're not at your best during cocktail hour. Which is exactly why you scheduled this meeting so late. Oh, do n't get rattled. You can do this. I have n't had so much fun since I got a flock of seagulls to crash your sweet sixteen. Again, your other daughter. Oh, let me introduce you to Twister. Our new vice-president of dance movement. Yeah, and Cyclone, executive vice-president of marketing, sales and planning. And off course you all know my prot? g?, Panic. Thrilled to meet you. Well, I know how excited we all are about my fathers ' sudden return from the wilderness, accompanied by his new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, new ideas about to re-invigorate the music industry. A revolution. We all know the problems of our dying business. Ben 's here to give us the answers. I 'm old. I 'm used up. I 'm irrelevant. And so is everyone else in this fucking room. Even my daughter. Thirty two. - Thirty six. See. Ancient. We do n't know what people want. How could we? I 'm supposed to give you some magic answer. The phantom Holy Grail. Now, these ladies, they used to be exotic stripper dancers. And they gyrated for free, while excited men stuffed dollars in their panties. Just to keep them dancing. Anything to keep them dancing. And if we like what we get for free, we will pay for it to continue. A Utopian meritocracy. What if music were free? Pay for what you think it 's worth. When Radiohead released their new album on the net, 75% of the people who downloaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people who listen to Radiohead are guilty white liberals. And who do you think listens to hip-hop? It 's one thing we iTune song of the week, it 's another to rely on generosity for an entire album. One album? I 'm talking about the entire CMG catalogue. The whole thing, everything. Fuck, I 'd even put..... alternate takes out there. Put our entire music library on the net for free? What about paying the publishers? - Fuck the publishers! We 'll create enough interest to make ten times more on the..... Put a time limit on it, send out an e-mail... - Or a text. One hour, any CMG song you want. A shoplifting spree. A ticking clock. Grab everything you can. Go! Think of the publicity we 'll get. We 'll promote new artists, we 'll stir up the heat of the classics. We 'll rediscover one hit wonders. We 'll create demand. Generate a market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future is free! Okay, who 's with me? Come on! Congratulations. I see you felt inspired. Why do I doubt? Going out there works every time. What did I tell you about the time I spent with Dylan, we went to visit Woody Guthrie at Greystone. Who 's Woody Guthrie? Who 's Woody Guthrie? She knows. You 're relieved of duty. With pay. This is got ta be a joke. Is this a joke? - Watch your tone. Look at you, you 're a mess. Listen Battaglia, if I were you, my first stop on the way out of here... Bed Bath Beyond. What the hell are you talking about? That you need to pick up a mirror. Cause obviously, you do n't have mirrors at your house. If you did, you 'd know you 're not that good looking. But your wife, she 's beautiful. Which makes you one lucky bastard. Who mucked up this whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. You need to calm your penis down, my friend. Pussy 's pussy. For every hot broad out there, there 's a guy who 's tired of fucking her. That 's not the broad 's problem. It 's the guy 's. I know. So you 're suspended. You wan na come back to work here... I need smart cops. Get it together, Battaglia. Now. Yes, sir. Park won. What? Dae.... says he raped the girl, not Park. Fuck! Yeah, he came in, wrists up. Ready to confess. He 's taking the fall for Park. Why would he do that? Why do you think? Money. I 'm sure Mr. Park promised Dae... his family would never have to worry about money again. Look, I want my family protected. Round the clock. It does n't work like that, Eddie. I gave a statement. I put my family at risk. I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on something else? What else? I did n't make the connection until I saw the picture. What are you talking about? Mr. Park hired someone to kill my friends Rock and Shin. How do you know that? I was there. He tried to kill me too. But I got away. Do you have a name? Detective Finet. The one in the picture with Mr. Park. What? No, you have to be mistaken. He 's working on taking Park down, too. He killed my friends and he 's tried to kill me. You do n't wan na believe me. Fine, I 'm out of here. No. If that is true, you have to come down... Look, I do n't have to anything except protect my family. Eddie. I can help you. I 'll call you. Fuck! Hey. They took away my gun and my badge. I 'm suspended. Welcome to the club. What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't. They 're kids. They got scared. You were cursing. Yeah, what did I say? That 's fucking bullshit, for starters. Yeah, one of the kids called his parents, told my boss. Ted hates me already, he was happy to have a reason to see me suspended for a day. I 'm talking about a lot more than one day. Amy. I lose my job, I do n't have a pension. Benefits. I mean, that could not be smart. You know what, I really do n't give a shit. I can sell this house. You do n't think I can take care of myself and the boys? They 'll be embarrassed by their unemployed, ex-cop father. Right now, the only thing they 're embarrassed by is the fact that their dad ca n't keep his dick in his pants. You know, I am willing, Kenny, to help you through whatever it is that 's going on. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake up. That 's why I 'm here. I 'm not letting you in. Sure. I just came by to tell you, I got the message. I heard.
