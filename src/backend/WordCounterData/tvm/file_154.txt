5239441 - Previously : - I love you. Oh, my God. Here lies the warrior of the people. Let her cross over! I think I was in Heaven. I was torn out of there by my friends. They can never know. We ca n't ignore this behaviour. Something needs to be done. I 'm glad you 're here to take care of it. We 're getting married. Willow, you 're using too much magic. - Can we not do this now? - Forget it ever happened. Forget. Every single night, the same arrangement I go out and fight the fight Still I always feel the strange estrangement Nothing here is real, nothing here is right I 've been making shows of trading blows Just hoping no one knows That I 've been going through the motions Walking through the part Nothing seems to penetrate my heart I was always brave, and kind of righteous Now I find I 'm wavering Crawl out of your grave, You 'll find this fight just - Does n't mean a thing - She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty well with fiends from Hell, but lately we can tell - That she 's just going through the motions - Going through the motions Faking it somehow She 's not even half the girl she... Ow! Will I stay this way for ever? Sleepwalk through my life 's endeavour? - How can I repay... - Whatever I do n't want to be Going through the motions Losing all my drive I ca n't even see If this is really me And I just want to be Alive - Good morning, Buffy! - Did Dawn get off to school all right? What? Oh, yeah. I think so. Respect the cruller. And tame the doughnut! That 's still funny, sweetie. So, uh, no research? Nothing goin ' on? Monsters or whatnot? Good. Good. So, did anybody... Last night, you know, did anybody... burst into song? Merciful Zeus! - We thought it was just us! - I had my guitar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was like... - You were in a musical. That explains the huge backing orchestra and the dancing room-service chaps. - We argued, then it rhymed... - An entire verse about couscous. - It was very disturbing. - What did you sing about? I do n't remember. But it seemed perfectly normal. But disturbing. Not natural. Do you think it 'll happen again? We should look into it. - With the books. - Do we have any books on this? We break it down. Look at the factors before it happens again. I for one... I 've got a theory That it 's a demon A dancing demon No, something is n't right there I 've got a theory Some kid is dreaming And we 're all stuck inside his wacky Broadway nightmare I 've got a theory we should work this out It 's getting eerie What 's this cheery singing all about? It could be witches! Some evil witches Which is ridiculous cos witches they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'll be over here I 've got a theory It could be bunnies - I 've got a... - Bunnies are n't just cute Like everybody supposes They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses And what 's with all the carrots? What do they need such good eyesight for anyway? Bunnies! Bunnies! It must be bunnies! - Or maybe midgets - I 've got a theory we should work this fast Because it clearly could get serious before it 's passed I 've got a theory It does n't matter What ca n't we face if we 're together? What 's in this place that we ca n't weather? Apocalypse? We 've all been there The same old trips Why should we care? What ca n't we do if we get in it? We 'll work it through within a minute We have to try We 'll pay the price It 's do or die Hey, I 've died twice - What ca n't we face if we 're together? - What ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we ca n't weather? - If we 're together There 's nothing we ca n't face Except for bunnies - See, OK, that was disturbing. - I thought it was neat. So what is it? What 's causing it? I thought it did n't matter. Well, I 'm not quaking in my stylish-yet-affordable boots, but there 's something unnatural going on. And that does n't usually lead to hugs and puppies. Well, is it just us? I mean, is it only happening to us? Cos that would probably mean a spell. They got the mustard - out! - They got the mustard out! It 's not just us. Oh, my God. You will never believe what happened at school today. Everybody started singing and dancing? I gave birth to a pterodactyl. Oh, my God. Did it sing? - So you guys too, huh? - So what 'd you sing about? Math. That 's right! The volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... text. - You know. The mmummrfugh report. The what now? There 's a few volumes at the house about mystical chants, bacchanals. - Might be relevant. - Yeah, we could... I 'm a hair 's breadth from investigating bunnies, so I 'm open to anything. Great. We 'll check it out and we 'll give you a call. Yeah, this could blow the whole thing wide open. Do we have any books at all at home? Who wants to be cooped up on a day like this? The sun is shining, there 's songs going on, those guys are checking you out... What? What are they looking at? - The hotness of you, doofus. - Those boys really thought I was hot? Entirely. Oh, my God. I 'm cured! I want the boys! Do I have to fight to keep you? Cos I 'm not large with the butch. I 'm just... not used to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't imagine what they see in you? I know exactly what they see in me. You. I lived my life in shadow Never the sun on my face It did n't seem so sad though I figured that was my place Now I 'm bathed in light Something just is n't right I 'm under your spell How else could it be Anyone would notice me? It 's magic, I can tell How you 've set me free Brought me out so easily I saw a world enchanted Spirits and charms in the air I always took for granted I was the only one there But your power shone Brighter than any I 've known I 'm under your spell Nothing I can do You just took my soul with you You worked your charms so well Finally, I knew Everything I dreamed was true You make me believe The moon to the tide I can feel you inside I 'm under your spell Surging like the sea Go to you so helplessly I break with every swell Lost in ecstasy Spread beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete You make me complete You make me... - I bet they 're not even working. - Who now? Willow and Tara. You see the way they were with each other? The get-a-roominess? I bet they 're... Singing. They 're probably singing right now. I 'm sure they 're making every effort. - Oh, yeah. - Xander. Buffy, it 's OK. I do know about this stuff. - Besides, it 's all kinda romantic. - No, it 's not. Come on! Songs, dancing around. What 's gon na be wrong with that? Aargh! Argh! That 's entertainment. You want some breakfast, baby? - You do n't have to go to work? - Nah, I shut the crew down for the day. My guys start dancing around me, I do n't know if I can deal. It 's a flab thing. So... waffles? Will you still make me waffles when we 're married? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but by California law you will own half of them. Hey, how about omelettes? I could do an omelette... This man that I plan to entangle Is n't he fine? My claim to fame was to maim and to mangle Vengeance was mine But I 'm out of the biz The name I made, I 'll trade for his The only trouble is... I 'll never tell She is the one She 's such wonderful fun Such passion and grace Warm in the night when I 'm right in her tight Embrace, tight embrace I 'll never let her go The love we 've known can only grow There 's just one thing that... No, I 'll never tell Cos there 's nothing to tell - He snores - She wheezes Say " housework " and he freezes She eats these skeezy cheeses that I ca n't describe - I talk, he breezes - She does n't know what pleases His penis got diseases from a Chumash tribe The vibe gets kind of scary - Like she thinks I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like her toes are kind of hairy - But it 's all very well Cos God knows, I 'll never tell When things get rough, he Just hides behind his Buffy Now look, he 's getting huffy cos he knows that I know She clings, she 's needy She 's also really greedy - She nev... - His eyes are beady This is my verse! Hello! She... Look at me! I 'm dancing crazy! You know... - You 're quite the charmer - My knight in armour You 're the cutest of the Scoobies With your lips as red as rubies And your firm yet supple... tight embrace! - He 's swell - She 's sweller He 'll always be my fella That 's why I 'll never tell her that I 'm petrified I 've read this tale There 's wedding, then betrayal I know that come the day I 'll want to run and hide I lied I said it 's easy I 've tried But there 's these fears I ca n't quell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I look good when I 've gotten old? Will our lives become too stressful if I 'm never that successful? When I get so worn and wrinkly that I look like David Brinkley - Am I crazy? - Am I dreaming? Am I marrying a demon? We could really raise the beam in making marriage a hell So, thank God, I 'll never tell I swear that I 'll never tell My lips are sealed I take the Fifth Nothin ' to see, move it along I 'll never... tell - It 's a nightmare. It 's a plague. - It 's like we were being watched. - I did n't wan na say things but they came out. - Like a wall was missing from our apartment. - My toes are not hairy! - My eyes are not beady! - You got ta stop it. - I am looking into some leads... Of course, our number is a retro pastiche that 's never going to be a breakaway pop hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to point it. - As ever, it 's not quite that simple. - But I have learned some disturbing things... -.. put that pad away I 'm asking you, please no It is n't right, it is n't fair There was no parking anywhere I think that hydrant was n't there Why ca n't you let it go? - I think I 've paid more than my share... - Somebody set people on fire? That 's nuts! I do n't know. One more verse of our ditty and I 'd have been looking for a gas can. Well, clearly emotions are running high. But as far as I can tell these people burnt up from the inside, spontaneously combusted. I 've only seen the one. I examined the body while the police were taking witness arias. But we 're sure the things are related, the singing and dancing and burning and dying. We 're not sure of much. Buffy 's looking for leads at the local demon haunts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... she does n't seem to... She 's easing back into it. We pulled her out of an untold Hell dimension. Ergo the weirdness. The important thing is to be there for her. I 'm helping her as much as I can, but, er... The sun sets and she appears. - Come to serenade me? - So you know what 's going on. I 've seen some damn funny things the last two days. A 600-pound Chirago demon making like Yma Sumac, that one will stay with you. I remain immune, happy to say. Drink? A world of no. So any idea what 's causing this? Oh. So that 's all. You 've just come to pump me for information. What else would I wan na pump you for? I really just said that, did n't I? Yeah, well... do n't wan na bore you with the small talk. Do n't know a thing. - What 's up? You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could stop by. - It 's nothing! - What? I died So many years ago But you can make me feel Like it is n't so And why you come to be with me I think I finally know Mm-mm You 're scared Ashamed of what you feel And you ca n't tell the ones you love You know they could n't deal Whisper in a dead man 's ear It does n't make it real That 's great But I do n't wan na play Cos bein ' with you touches me More than I can say But since I 'm only dead to you I 'm saying stay away And let me rest in peace Let me rest in peace Let me get some sleep Let me take my love and bury it In a hole six foot deep I can lay my body down but I ca n't find my sweet release So let me rest in peace You know You got a willing slave And you just love to play the thought That you might misbehave But till you do I 'm tellin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest in peace I know I should go But I follow you like a man possessed There 's a traitor here beneath my breast And it hurts me more than you 've ever guessed If my heart could beat it would break my chest But I can see you 're unimpressed So leave me be And let me rest in peace Let me get some sleep Let me take my love and bury it In a hole six foot deep I can lay my body down but I ca n't find my sweet release Let me rest in peace. Why wo n't you Let me rest in peace? So... you 're not staying then? - Lot of homework? - Math. It seemed cool when we were singing about it. Willow said they have a lead on the whole musical-extravaganza evil. This demon that can be summoned, some sort of lord of the dance. But not the scary one. Just a demon. - Do they know who summoned it? - They do n't even know its name. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type. - I 'm glad you guys made up. - What? That fight you guys had about magic and stuff? It gives me belly rumblings when you guys fight. Dawn, Willow and I never fought about... It 's OK. It 's just... You guys are so great together. I just hate it when you... But that was the only fight I 've seen you guys have anyway. But I 'm still glad it 's over. Dawn, I... There 's something I need at the shop. Will you be OK for a little while? Yes. The 15-year-old can spend half an hour alone in her locked house. I wo n't be gone long. Does anybody even notice? Does anybody even care? Why 'd you run away? Do n't you like my... style? Why do n't you come and play? I guarantee a Great big smile I come from the imagination And I 'm here strictly by your invocation So whaddaya say? Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm the twist and shout When you got ta sing When you got ta Let it out You call me and I come a-runnin ' I turn the music on I bring the fun in Now we 're partyin ' That 's what it 's all about Cos I know What you feel, girl I know Just what you feel, girl So you 're, like, a good demon? Bringin ' the fun in? All these melodies They go on too long Then that energy Starts to come on Way too strong All those hearts laid open, that must sting Plus some customers just start combusting That 's the penalty When life is but a song You brought me down and doomed this town So when we blow this scene Back we will go to my kingdom below And you will be my queen Cos I know what you feel, girl No, you see, you and me would n't be very regal I 'll make it real, girl What I mean, I 'm fifteen So this queen thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still have time to get a soft-shoe in Well, that 's great, but I 'm late and I 'd hate to delay her Something 's cookin ', I 'm at the griddle I bought Nero his very first fiddle She 'll get pissed if I 'm missed See, my sister 's the Slayer - The Slayer? - Yuh-huh. Find her. Tell her... tell her everything. Just get her here. I wan na see the Slayer burn. Now we 're partyin ' That 's what it 's all about Good. Good. I feel like I should bow, or... have honour, or something. It may seem hokey but we need precision and concentration as much as power. - We 're not sure what we 're facing. - Oh, you 'll figure it out. I 'm worried this session 's gon na turn into some training montage from an ' 80s movie. Well, if we hear any inspirational power chords, we 'll just lie down until they go away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work that much on your strength. Yeah, I 'm pretty spry for a corpse. Have you spoken to Dawn about that incident at Halloween? Oh. I thought you took care of that. - Right. - What would I do without you? OK. I 'm ready. You 're not ready for the world outside You keep pretending, but you just ca n't hide I know I said that I 'd be standing by your side But I... Your path 's unbeaten and it 's all uphill And you can meet it, but you never will And I 'm the reason that you 're standing still But I... I wish I could say the right words To lead you through this land Wish I could play the father And take you by the hand Wish I could stay here But now I understand I 'm standing In the way The cries around you, you do n't hear at all Cos you know I 'm here to take that call So you just lie there when you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay your arms down And let you rest at last Wish I could slay your demons But now that time has passed Wish I could stay here Your stalwart, standing fast But I 'm standing In the way I 'm just standing In the way Did you just say something? I 'm under your spell God, how can this be? Playing with my memory You know I 've been through hell Willow, do n't you see? There 'll be nothing left of me You made me - Believe - Believe me, I do n't wan na go And it 'll grieve me cos I love you so But we both know - Wish I could say the right words - Wish I could trust that it was - To lead you through this land - Just this once, but I must do - Wish I could play the father - What I must. I ca n't adjust to this - And take you by the hand - Disgust, we 're done and I just Wish I could stay Wish I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lookie lookie what I found. - Is this the demon guy? - Tara! Works for him. Has a nice little story for the Slayer, do n't you? Come on, then. Sing. My master has the Slayer 's sister at the Bronze because she summoned him. At midnight he 's going to take her to the underworld to be his queen. What does he want? Her. If that 's all you 've got to say, then I 'm... Strong. Someday he 'll be a real boy. So, Dawn 's in trouble. - Must be Tuesday. - I just left her for a few minutes. It 's not your fault. So what 's the plan? - Plan, schman. Let 's mount up. - No. Dawn had the wrong idea in summoning this creature, but... I 've seen some of these underworld child-bride deals and they never end well. - Well, maybe once. - We 're not just gon na stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone. - Do n't be a stupid git. There is no... - If I want your opinion, Spike, I 'll... I 'll never want your opinion. - A little confusion spell could... - No! I mean, I do n't think it 'll help. Forget them, Slayer. I got your back. I thought you wanted me to stay away from you. Is n't that what you sang? Spike sing a wittle song? - Was it a pop hit or more of a book number? - Let it go, sweetie. Fine. I hope you dance till you burn. You and the little bit. You 're really not coming? It 's up to you, Buffy. - What do you expect me to do? - Your best. I touch the fire And it freezes me I look into it and it 's black Why ca n't I feel? My skin should crack and peel I want the fire back Now through the smoke, she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To save the day Or maybe melt away I guess it 's all the same So I will walk through the fire Cos where else can I turn? I will walk through the fire And let it... The torch I bear is scorching ' me And Buffy 's laughin ', I 've no doubt I hope she fries I 'm free if that bitch dies! I 'd better help her out Cos she is drawn to the fire - Some people never learn - She will never learn And she will walk through the fire And let it... Will this do a thing to change her? Am I leaving Dawn in danger? Is my slayer too far gone to care? What if Buffy ca n't defeat it? Beady-Eyes is right, we 're needed! Or we could just sit around and glare We 'll see it through It 's what we 're always here to do So we will walk through the fire So one by one, they turn from me - I guess my friends ca n't face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I froze, not one among them knows - If we 're together? And never can be told - She came from the grave much graver - So one by one - First he 'll kill her, then I 'll save her - They come to me - Everything is turning out so dark - The distant redness as their guide - No, I 'll save her, then I 'll kill her - That single flame - I think this line 's mostly filler - Ai n't what they had in mind - What 's it going to take to strike a spark? - It 's what they have inside - These endless days are ending in a blaze - She will come - And we are caught in the fire - To me! The point of no return So we will walk through the fire And let it Burn Let it burn Let it burn Showtime. - I love a good entrance. - How are you with death scenes? You got a name? I 've got a hundred. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be my brother-in-law. Buffy, I swear I did n't do it. Do n't worry. You 're not going anywhere. - I am. - What? Deal 's this. I ca n't kill you, you take me to Hellsville in her place. - What if I kill you? - Trust me. Wo n't help. - That 's gloomy. - That 's life. Come, now, is that really what you feel? Is n't life a miraculous thing? I think you already know. Life 's a show And we all play our parts And when the music starts We open up our hearts It 's all right if some things come out wrong We 'll sing a happy song And you can sing along Where there 's life there 's hope Every day 's a gift Wishes can come true Whistle while you work So hard, all day To be like other girls To fit in in this glittering world Do n't give me songs - She needs backup. Anya, Tara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to sing about - Ahh-ahh-ahh - I need something to sing about - Ahh-ahh-ahh Life 's a song you do n't get to rehearse And every single verse Can make it that much worse Still my friends do n't know why I ignore The million things or more I should be dancing for All the joy life sends Family and friends All the twists and bends Knowing that it ends Well that depends On if they let you go On if they know enough to know That when you 've bowed You leave the crowd There was no pain No fear, no doubt Till they pulled me out Of Heaven So that 's my refrain I live in Hell Cos I 've been expelled From Heaven I think I was in Heaven So give me something to sing about Please give me something... Life 's not a song Life is n't bliss Life is just this It 's living You 'll get along The pain that you feel You only can heal By living You have to go on living So one of us is living The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Now that was a show-stopping number. Not quite the fireworks that I was looking for... Get out of here. Mm, I smell power. I guess the little missus and I should be on our way. That 's never gon na happen. I do n't make the rules. She summoned me. I so did not. He keeps saying that. You have my talisman on, sweet thing. Oh, but, no, I... This... at the Magic Box, on the floor. I was cleaning, and I... forgot... - But I did n't summon anything. - Well, now, that 's a twist. If it was in the shop... then one of us probably... - Xander?! - Well, I did n't know what was gon na happen. I just thought there were gon na be dances and songs. I just wanted to make sure we 'd work out. Get a happy ending. I think everything worked out just fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your queen? It 's tempting. But I think we 'll waive that clause just this once. Big smiles, everyone! You beat the bad guy. What a lot of fun You guys have been real... swell And there 's not a one Who can say this Ended well All those secrets you 've been concealing Say you 're happy now Once more, with feeling Now I got ta run See you all In Hell! Where do we go From here? Where do we go From here? The battle 's done and we kind of won So we sound our victory cheer Where do we go From here? Why is the path Unclear? When we know home Is near? Understand we 'll go hand in hand But we 'll walk alone in fear Tell me Where do we go From here? When does " The End " Appear? - Bugger this. - When do the trumpets cheer? The curtains close on a kiss, God knows We can tell the end is near... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big group sing. Get your kum ba ya-yas out. I do n't want to. The day you suss out what you do want, there 'll probably be a parade. 76 bloody trombones. - Spike... - Look, you do n't have to say anything. I touch the fire and it freezes me - I died... so many years ago - I look into it and it 's black - This is n't real, but I just want to feel - But you can make me feel Where do we go from here?
