Does that mean he Beatin ' up the coochie? That 's what " new friend " mean to me. Hold on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! I just had to slap the [bleep] out of somebody for no reason. Now, what was it you were trying to say about your special friend? His name is Jesse. And he 's a good Christian man with benefits. Benefits?! Shoot, girl, why did n't you say so? Good mern-ting! Hell, you can get me for no extra charge. Oh, honey, this booty is still good. You can go ahead and check the expiration date on it. I ai n't lying! Unh! Dip it low! Unh! Unh! Unh! Unh! Unh! Heller! Granddad, why are we watching a Winston Jerome play? Ah, shut up, boy. Stop hating. It just so happens Winston Jerome is holding an open casting call for the leading man in his new play, and I 'm preparing for my audition. Audition? Like an acting audition? Acting audition of a lifetime. But you do n't act. Do n't act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thespian! Oh-ho-ho-ho! But this was long before the days of Terrence Howard. See, Hollywood did n't have room for a young, handsome, light-skinned black man with good hair in those days. And action. They call me Mr. Pibb. What 's so funny? Mr. Pibb. That 's a soda 's name. Oh, is it " ribs "? They call me Mr. ribs. He is so bad. Bull [bleep] Mr. handyman! Oh! My foot! My foot! Oh! Ooh! Cramp! Cramping real bad! Oh! Maybe you 'd like to see a real man. I bet you stay up late dreaming you had a real man. I pity the fool. Thank you. That 's enough. We 'll call you. Thank you for the opportunity. Breaking into Hollywood at your age? He 's looking for mature men. See, look right here. " Casting for a black leading " man, 50 and older. Light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not " allergic to baby oil. " That 's me all day. Do n't you ever think you 're too old to do some of that stuff you do? Why ca n't I be a sex symbol? Why ca n't I be a heartthrob? I say do it before it 's too late. And it 's gon na be too late real soon, so, uh, yeah. Hurry up. Thank you, Riley. I 'm gon na really let him have it, show him my stuff, give that man everything I got. Pause. Pause? Pause what? You said something gay, so you got to say " no-homo, " or else you 's a homo. What did I say gay? You said you was gon na give this dude everything you got - - no-homo. That 's not gay. I said I was gon na give the man everything I got. Pause, granddad. If you sound gay, it 's gay, and you got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a homo, granddad, if you do n't say " no-homo "? I 'm not saying " no-homo. " Okay. You want to be a homo. Stop calling your granddaddy a homo! Then say " no-homo. " I do n't want to say " no-homo. " I 'm gon na homo your ass, you do n't stop saying " pause. " Pause. The typical Winston Jerome story starts with a beautiful, educated, professional black woman trapped in a troubled marriage with the brown-skinned bald dude from " law order. " How can you do this to me? Get out! I 'm gon na marry this white hussy because you are too virtuous and strong and might make me a better man. Then a dude who looks like Shemar Moore shows up as the shirtless light-skinned gardener who just got out of jail. Excuse me, uh, may I rake your leaves? At first, she acts like she does n't like the light-skinned gardener. But eventually she gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I know that to you, I 'm just a poor light-skinned gardener who ca n't even afford a shirt, but I love me some Jesus, and I love me some you. Oh, lord, thank you, Jesus! I never thought I 'd ever be with a man so loving and light-skinned. And I will always be light-skinneded just for you. Being a good Christian woman, she gives her marriage one last chance, because Jesus said so. I am dark-skinned and bald, so I hate you, and I hate Jesus. Just when the brown-skinned dude from " Law Order " is about to hit her, here comes the shirtless gardener. Hold it right there, bald-headed dude from " Law Order "! The woman and the gardener kiss, having found true love through Jesus. Which role are you auditioning for? Oh, no, no. You ca n't get her. I did n't think there would be this many people here just for a play. Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts with the play, but if he like you in the play, now you in the movie of the play, and if he like you in the movie of the play, now you in the TV spin-off of the movie of the play. Wait a minute. You 're Kadeem Hardison, star of TV 's " A Different World. " What are you doing here? I do n't know if you know this, but there ai n't exactly a bunch of other [bleep] We could be doing right now. I mean, what, I 'm supposed to wait for the next " Akeelah and the bee " to pay my mortgage? Huh? No, thanks. It 's him! Back this way, man. Shh! Mm-hmm. Mnh-mnh. Mr. Jerome would like to see you. He would? You wo n't be needing that shirt. Jesus told me in my next play Ma'dukes should find herself a man. So I 've decided to call this play " Ma'dukes finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man enough for Ma'dukes, Robert? Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Try this line. " Ma'dukes, you are a strong, " intelligent black woman who will " make me a better man. " Ma'dukes - - wait, wait. Something 's off. Lotion! What flavor you want, man? I got tropical peach, sunrise orange, minty mango, and apricot. Or I can just take two flavors and swirl them together. Just tell me which ones you like. You want me to pick one for you? Minty mango it is. Hmm. Turn around. Hey! You want me to pop these bumps? Uh, no. All right. You good, then. Okay, Robert. Again. M'dukes - - that 's it! Breathtaking! You know, I remember when I sat down to write my first play. I asked Jesus, " will you cowrite with me? " And he said, " yes. " And I told Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What do women want to see? " And Jesus said, " sexy men. " Since that day, I 've searched the world for the sexiest black men alive. And I found them - - my shirtless men. And Jesus was pleased. I did n't know religion worked like that. Then I asked Jesus, " how can I further spread your message on " earth? " And he said, " cross-dressing. " And so I put on a dress and a wig, and Jesus was pleased. With that dress, that wig, and these beautiful, muscular gifts from God, I have built an empire. And soon I will crush ice cube, and my supremacy of black Hollywood will be complete! Ice cube? We do n't allow just anyone on this journey. Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your lord and savior, Robert? Yeah, uh, I-I guess. Get on your knees, Robert. Ow! On your knees, Robert! Okay! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus Christ as your lord and savior, Robert? Yes. Do you accept me, Winston Jerome, as the representative of Jesus Christ in the TV and movie business? Sure. I guess. Do you renounce ice cube and all his works? Well, you know, I kind of like " Friday " - - do you renounce ice cube and all his works?! I renounce ice cube. Louder! I renounce ice cube! And all his works! And all his works! Including " Friday "? Yes! Including " Friday "! Yes! Rise! Rise, my new leading man! We 're having a fondue shindig at the compound tonight. You should come. Tom, thanks for agreeing to watch the boys tonight. No problem, Robert. I mean, this is your big break. So, what is he like? Who? Winston? Uh... Nice guy, down-to-earth. Nothing strange or freaky or bizarre about him at all. Nope, nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best! That 's what people need more of - - positive entertainment, without all the cursing and people saying the n-word all the time. Hey, are there gon na be some steamy scenes to look forward to, huh? Who 's the lucky leading lady? Uh, actually, um... They have n't cast her yet. Probably, uh, Sanaa Lathan, maybe Halle Berry... You know, somebody hot. Man, stop lying! Granddad 's leading lady is a dude. What? Shut up, boy! You do n't know nothing! We read the script, granddad. How dare you read that script?! That 's top secret! It was really, really terrible, by the way. Do n't front, granddad. You playin ' a dude 's boyfriend. It 's that Winston Jerome guy in a dress! Ha! You mean Ma'dukes? You 're playing Ma'dukes ' boyfriend? There are no love scenes. Granddad 's gon na need to have " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no love scenes! I think that 's great. Robert, you 're a real actor now, completely dedicated to the part! I say do the love scenes! But there are no love scenes! Well, I think it 's gay. Dude wear a dress! Jesus told him to wear that dress! You just mad ' cause Jesus does n't love you. Hello, Robert. We 're so glad you decided to join us. Come in. I do n't mind if I do, cupcakes. Hello, how do you do? We 're so glad you joined our crew. Welcome to our lovely compound, where it all goes down. * Hot oil, bananas and cream * * bananas and cream * * white unicorns and wet dreams * * rainbow and lace * * oh, it makes me want to scream * * anything is possible with Jesus on our team * * it 's all right to cross-dress for Christ * * Whoo * * Jesus gave me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * to wear corsets and real fine linen * * big bras with a lot of padding in ' em * * am I feminine? * * I know you have suspicions * * but I 'm all man, trust me * * we could switch positions * * it 's all right to cross-dress for Christ * * it 's all right to cross-dress for Christ * * Whoo * Wow. Is that in the play? No, we just do that for fun. Come, let me show you the compound. The cast and crew of my plays are like family. We work together, eat together, pray together. Now, let me show you where you 'll be staying. Um, did you say " staying "? Oh, yes. You 'll live here at the compound during the run of the play. I want everyone totally immersed in the production. And we do n't allow outside calls here. We must remove all distractions. Oh, it 's just my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to their sole legal guardian. Tell them you wo n't be coming home for a while. Best to make it a clean break. Uh, I 'll just call ' em back. Answer it! Hey, boys. Hey, granddad, we were just wondering how late rehearsal was gon na go. Tom had to leave, and we 're getting kind of hungry. Well, uh, I 'm not coming home for a while, so do n't wait up. How late? Uh, maybe a week or two or more. We got a lot of rehearsal stuff to do. Uh, there 's some cash in my sock drawer. Praise Jesus. This is a great day, brothers and sisters. The first day of rehearsals for " Ma'dukes finds herself a man "! Let us pray. Lord Jesus, you are a wonderful savior and an excellent producing partner, as well... Waa waa waa-waa... [thinking] I ca n't believe I 'm here. I made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might already be at the top. Man, look at these broads in here. The big ' ol zesty-chesty on that one.... In Jesus ' name we pray. Amen. Yes, amen. Yeah, boy! We 're so happy you 're here with us, Robert. Jesus is so good. I 've been working with Mr. Jerome for nearly 10 years. Oh, your family must be very proud. Honey, I do n't talk to my family anymore. This is my family now. Soon it 'll be yours, too. I 'm gon na get me some kool-aid. Well, this is my first Winston Jerome project, but I 've been in the business for almost 12 years. Oh, that 's nice. Anything I might have seen? Let 's see. I was in " do the tight thing, " uh, " lady sucks the blues, " " new crack city, " and then my last film was " six dicks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that was before Winston saved me. All that time, I was giving up the ass for me. Now I only give up the ass for Jesus... And his homeboys. Mm-hmm. Praise Jesus in the name of Jesus. Robert, would you join me in my study? Beautiful, is n't it? I had the sweater put on him because he just looked so cold up there. I just wanted to warm him up... Because I love Jesus. Do you love Jesus, Robert? Oh, yes. I love me some Jesus, mm-hmm. He 's my copilot. Lord, we thank you for... Well, it appears you love ta-tas, too. Yeah, uh, I 'm, uh... It 's okay, Robert. You love women more than you love Jesus, do n't you? It 's hard to say. I mean, it 's kind of apples and oranges. If women are what you desire, Robert, then Jesus and I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind you want. Well, now, since you put it like that, I want some of them, uh, Alicia keys and a couple them Beyonc? s and something Spanish and a big-ol ' - tittied white woman that look like Lynda Carter. Then Jesus will provide them. But you must give yourself to Jesus first, Robert... and to me. You know how I feel about the [bleep] phone! It 's my grandkids. They 're probably just worried. You must choose, Robert, between your old life and your new one. Hey, boys. Uh, no, everything 's good. Look, please do n't call me again. This is my family now. Uh-huh. Okay. You made the right choice, Robert. I do n't get it. They his new family now? It 's worse than I thought. Granddad 's in a cult. A cult? That 's gay. Well, he 's in trouble. We got to save him. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm a big-shot lawyer. Cut! Frown! How are they gon na know you 're mad if you do n't frown? More! More, more, damn it! You want me to put something nasty in your mouth to help you frown?! Ugh. Okay, continue. Well, at least I have Jesus and the strong love of a black, African, beautiful, independent black woman - - cut, cut, cut, cut, cut! This is n't working! I can not work like this anymore! I 've worked with Jesus! Damn it! Let us pray. Jesus, Holy Jesus... Help us with this scene. It seems to be a little flat. Wait - - Jesus is trying to tell me something. Hold on. Praise Jesus! Yes, Jesus. Uh-huh. Right, right. Hey, you 're the boss. Jesus says the scene would have more impact if you grabbed Ma'dukes and kissed her deep on the lips. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that we need to kiss passionately so the audience can feel our love. Change it in the script! Praise Jesus ' rewrites! Are you sure he did n't say " kick "? I should kick you? Or maybe " kill "? Let me kill you. Nobody 'd ever see that coming. No! He said " kiss "! Kiss! There was no ambiguity at all. Chapstick! Robert, it 's okay. I totally understand your concerns. Winston Jerome would never, ever kiss a man. That would be homosexual and against my Christian faith. Whew! Exactly! Mine too! But Jesus wants us to be actors first and heterosexuals second. Now, Winston Jerome is a very, very straight man that loves the ladies. But Ma'dukes is a woman, and when I go onstage, Jesus wants me to become her, inside and out. I ca n't just have a woman 's clothes. I need a woman 's thoughts, a woman 's movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on! Excuse me, do you know where I could find Robert Freeman? Just walk in the path of Jesus. You 'll find him. Uh, excuse me. We 're looking for Robert Freeman. Oh, he 's on the rehearsal stage. Y'all remind me of my grandsons. But they like ice cube movies, so I ca n't never speak to them again. Excuse me. I 'm gon na get me some kool-aid. Well, at least I have Jesus and the love of a strong, black, African, beautiful, independent black woman! And that 's all I need. Aah! Oof! Boys! Stop that! Get his legs! His legs! I rebuke you in the name of the lord! Get them! Ow! Get them out of here! These niggas is too glisteny. Did you think you could just take him? It 's too late. Your granddaddy is one of us now. It 's okay, guys. I 'm sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus want them out of here, Robert - - pronto! Granddad, snap out of it! Ow! Damn it! Ow! Nigga, have you lost your [bleep] damn mind? Granddad, you 've been brainwashed. You 've been sucked into some bizarre homoerotic Christian theater cult! Yeah, you was about to kiss that dude, no-homo. Boy, I 'm just acting. I know it 's a homoerotic Christian theater cult, but if it gets me into Hollywood, who cares? It ca n't be worse than Scientology. Do you really want to be famous that bad? Yes. My whole life, I 've been normal. Normal sucks! I want women half my age to throw themselves at me! I want people to treat me better than they treat other people. And Riley was right - - I do n't have much time left. Maybe it 's a stupid dream, but this is the last chance I 'm gon na get at it. Remember that TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat goat rectums and monkey testicles and whatever else to win the big prize? Well, this is my " fear factor " and Ma'dukes is my monkey testicles and I really want the big prize, even if it means kissing a man. No-homo. And when you get home, go in my clean-underwear drawer. There should be $200 in quarters. That should be enough to get you through the week, and I 'll be home soon, okay? All right, granddad. If this is really what you want, we 'll get out of here. Good luck with that. Thank you for saying " no-homo, " granddad. That really meant a lot to me. No-homo. * Uh-huh, uh-huh * Well, at least I have Jesus and the love of a strong, black, African, beautiful, independent black woman! And that 's all I need. Kiss me, Ma'dukes! And now it 's time for me to get my big prize. * Groupies, groupies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! Huh? Uh-uh-aah! Oh, you look just like your pictures on MySpace! Oh, my goodness! Mr. Jerome would like to see you... Alone. Robert! You were amazing. Jesus and I were so pleased. Do n't give me that bull [bleep] This is the big prize? Where are the Alicia Keyses? Where are the Beyonc? s? Where 's wonder woman? All I see is Florida Evanses! I can get a big bitch on my own! I had to kiss you onstage in front of everybody, and all I get is them mud ducks out there?! That was n't the deal! Robert, Jesus never said it would happen overnight. Well, how long do I have to suck lips with you before the women out there become hot? Look, Robbie, I 've just sold " Ma'dukes finds herself a man " as a movie. And guess who 's my leading man? Really? I 'm gon na be in a movie. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only have one request. Look, man, all bull [bleep] Aside. Can I please just have some ass? Okay. Wait a minute! You mean to tell me you made up this whole cross-dressing Christian-cult crap just so you could sleep with men? Uh, pretty much, yeah. [bleep] you! Now stick that up your ass! No-homo. Pause. Pause again. Pause again, granddad! Pause again. Pause again. Pause again, granddad. Pause again, granddad.
