5225341 That 's me. Jane Quimby. My life is a little complicated right now. I landed my fashion dream job working for her, Gray Chandler Murray. The only problem, they think I 'm an adult. Now I am juggling two secret lives, one in high school and one in high fashion. Two months is a long time. What if Billy 's different? What if he does n't want to see me? BEN : You two will figure it out. You know why? You guys are like this. Jane, I see you 've met my nephew, Eli. Yeah, we... Nephew? I 'm pleased to introduce our newest designer, Eli Chandler. That 's a " no " on kissing at work. You and I both know that someone on the inside would like to see us fail. I ca n't do this anymore. Remember. We must impress this Harrods style director at any cost. Hello, losers. Where 's Jane? Hey, guys. What 's going on? Hello, Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my time here at Donovan Decker, I have taken rather quickly to Harrod 's. And they to me. Which is why I 've been given complete creative control over your collaboration with my store. I wish I could say that you 're all capable of Harrod 's caliber, but you 're going to have to prove it. Keep in mind, of course, that I will be very, very thorough. Now, in addition to supervising the new collection, I will also be overseeing your contribution to its newest, celebrity face. Who is that? Oh, my God, it 's... Aiden Chayse. I 'd like you to meet your design team here at Donovan Decker. How y'all doing? Who 's Aiden Chayse? - Are you kidding me? - Blasphemy. As I 'm sure you 're all aware, Aiden is Hollywood 's most promising young talent. He 's on billboards across the country and the bedroom doors of girls in every country. How 'd I get there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be right there with him. For the world to see. This is so cool. That is if I, and Mr. Chayse, of course, approve what you 've come up with. It 's up to you to impress. Do n't let us down. JANE : Mr. Chase, so nice to meet you. Something you 'd like to say, Gray? India. You were one of my top designers. You know what it takes, the hours, the hard work, that they put in to get here. Now I realize that you 're still angry, but treat them with respect. I am living proof that hard work does n't merit respect in your eyes, so save me the noble leader crap. Oh, and Gray? What was it that you used to say? Ah. I expect perfection.? I 've my heart where my head should be? Light up the rest of me? ' Cause your dreams, they wo n't fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life is a work of art Jane By Design 1x12 - The Celebrity Original air date June 12, 2012 Evil, secret leaking sabotager India... is the new Harrod 's style director. Yes. Bummer. Bummer? This is like an asteroid striking Earth, Billy. How big an asteroid? Just when I thought to calm down at work, India bursts in, bitchier than ever, stomping around Brian Atwood pumps. Which were actually super cute, which only makes me more annoyed. But, you know what makes me feel better? What? The thought I 'll be in a cemetery watching Creature From the Black Lagoon with you. Are we really going to that again? Come on! It 's tradition. Do n't you think doing something every year sorta runs the risk like, wearing it out? Um, no. Are you worn out on Thanksgiving? Or your birthday? Yeah, kinda. We 've gone together every year since we were seven. We 're not gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grumpy. BOY : Lowlife. GIRL : He 's a juvie loser. Yeah, I do n't wan na go anywhere that makes me feel like I do here. Do n't worry. It 'll be dark.( CHUCKLES) People wo n't even recognize you.( MOCKLAUGHTER) Funny, Jane. Please come. It 'll be fun. You, me, a cemetery and I 'll bring extra Sour Patch Kids. All right, fine. What is this? This is Renny the teddy bear. I combined our names in honor of our eight week anniversary. I thought we did the anniversary thing last week, Ben? Did we? I do n't remember that. Yeah. We had seven layer dip. You made us watch that Brad Pitt movie, Se7en. Well, I did n't make us watch. And it 's a great movie. Powerful ending. And the dip was pretty amazing. Ben, look. I thought we talked about this. I need us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? Absolutely. The kids rely on me to be a steady guiding influence. I ca n't be running around with teddy bears and eating candy hearts like a teenager in love. Say no more. Loud and clear. And no candy hearts. Ah, special delivery. Scrap those, we need to regroup. Okay. Hear me out on this. Rita said she wants to keep things " under the radar, " in the whole romance department, but does she really mean it? I 'd go with a " yes " on that. Yeah, normally, even I 'd say just go for it. But I think Jane has a point. Right. But every relationship I 've ever been in, has n't worked out because I did n't do enough. And I do n't want that to happen with Rita. She 's too special. I just want her to know what she means to me. I think she knows. Yeah, you do n't need 800 candy hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Is he serious? - No way. - Cancel it. - Cancel it. - A gorilla-gram?( CHUCKLING) - I know. But it 's so cute, my brother 's in love. Yeah, you know, I guess I do like them together. Me, too. All right. I 'm out. Seriously? Yeah, I have to get to work. I mean, I can stay. If you want me to stay. Do you want me to stay? No, it 's fine. Look, If you need me to, I totally will. No, you know, it 's fine. I 'll just eat lunch with Carl again. Carl? Carl, the janitor, Carl? Look, I 'll call in sick and we can hang out. No. It 's cool. Really. Okay, but only if you 're sure. Are we still on for the movie tomorrow night? Yeah. All righty, then. I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The vertex centroid is the intersection of the two bimedians. Surprise, surprise. PROFESSOR : As with the polygons, the X and Y coordinates of the vertex centroid... Really, Harper? You seriously think I 'm gon na take your purse? Unbelievable. Hey, nobody panic, all right? I want you all to know I 've been completely rehabilitated. Your valuables will be safe and sound right where they are. Dude. Relax. Oh, thanks for your input, Harper. Do I not look relaxed to you? Mr. Nutter, when you 've done being disruptive, I 'd like to get on with the class. This is ridiculous. That 's enough. I did n't do anything! Office. Now. Wow. I know what you 're thinking. Is that right? Yeah, you 're thinking Gray gave me this job just because I 'm her nephew. And you 're still a little upset because you feel like you deserved the job more than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired you. Look, I 've never actually been that close with my aunt. That fact actually helps less.( CHUCKLES) Jane. Look, I love design, okay, I really do. And I 'm good at it. So, the last thing I want is for you to feel like this was handed to me undeserved. Then prove it. I 'm serious. Prove to me that you deserve it. Well, I will. Well, you 'll have to do a whole lot better than this, then. Amateur. Immature. Undisciplined. This is not what Donovan Decker is about, my friend. Maybe we should be. We? Yeah. Maybe it 's time this whole company was a little less, uh... I do n't know, stuffy? Did you just call me stuffy? Oh, come on, man. That can not be the first time you 've heard that. Okay, boys. Look, you 're both very handsome. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. So why do n't we all just agree to disagree here? This is gon na be fun. I know what you 're thinking. You 're a mind reader? Cool. I 'm not gon na steal your purse. What 's wrong with my purse? Nothing. It 's fine. If I was looking to steal a purse, which I 'm not, yours would be the first one I 'd go after. You 're just saying that. - So what did you do? - Which time? Let 's start with the most recent one. I kinda lost it in class. Lost what?( SIGHS) My temper. My mind. I do n't know. What about you? I told my calculus teacher I do n't believe in pop quizzes. Rebel. Too bad you 're not a mind reader. We almost had something in common. Oh, so you read minds? Palms. Let me see your hands. - Seriously? - Mmm-hmm. Nails trimmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into sports. And a loner, but not entirely by choice. You just got out of juvie? Where does it say that? It does n't. I just heard it from someone. So we 're basically just holding hands right now? Sorry. Billy, you 're up. Zoe, do you mind if we discuss your transcripts tomorrow? I 'm kind of swamped today. Definitely, Miss Shaw. Transcripts? Pop quiz crusader sounded cooler.( EXCLAIMS) Billy. Miss Shaw. You 're a good kid. I know that. But the fact is, you have some strikes against you and you ca n't afford any misbehavior right now. One unexcused absence, one more time getting sent down here, and... But it was n't my fault. I know that, Billy, but the judge only agreed to release you early on the condition that he sees your weekly progress reports. All it takes is one slip up, and you could end up back in Newhall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to see that happen to you. Do you?( SIGHS) What 's the difference? Difference is that you are not that kid, Billy. I 'm not giving up on you here. You 've got to work with me, okay? Okay. Hmm. I have to say it 's... it 's not bad. I 'm actually impressed. Thank you, India. We 're rather proud of it. You should be. Well. I 'm going out to greet Mr. Chayse. He should be here momentarily. Excellent. We 're ready.( CHUCKLING) Here you go, non-fat latte. Mmm. Uh-uh. India. Okay, such a beautiful face should never look so sad. What 's the matter? I have to apologize in advance. For what? I 'm not gon na pretend that you 're gon na love the collection. Oh. Because you probably wo n't. The Donovan team wrapped a separate account yesterday and that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to know this is not how we operate at Harrod 's. Well, let 's have a look. - Okay. - All right. Of course if you like it, we can move forward, but if you do n't, please do n't hesitate for a second to be vocal. Let 's just say, it 'd mean more coming from you. Fair enough. - Mr. Chayse, how are you? - Gray. Hi. We 've come up with a line that we think you 're really going to respond to.( WHISPERS) - I think it looks great. - Wow. This is a disaster. I 'm really sorry, I ca n't put my face on this. - We 're screwed. - Hold on a minute. We 're not screwed. He just came in here and shot everything down. How are we not screwed? Okay, let 's just think about it for a minute. Okay. Maybe we are screwed. - Eli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aiden 's on the phone with his agents. Tell me we 've got something. Do n't everyone jump in at once. - We have... - Some seedlings. - We just... - We do n't need seedlings. We need something that he likes and we need it now. Well, it seems Mr. Chayse wants to move in a different direction. Meaning? Meaning you lost the collaboration, Jane. Guys, look. It 's nothing personal, I just think, creatively, this might not be the best fit. You should never compromise. Well, I appreciate it, thanks. Actually, Mr. Chayse. If you would n't mind taking a look at this, it 's a slightly different direction. Sure. GRAY :( WHISPERING) What are you doing? It 's a side project I 've been working on. Figured it ca n't hurt to show him, right? He was walking out of here, anyway. We have nothing to lose. This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look amazing. Good enough for a billboard? Perfect for a billboard. It 's magnificent. Well, thank you. You saved us. We need to talk. Sit down. I said sit down. I know what you did, Jeremy. How did you find out? I had security cameras installed. I 've seen everything. And I mean everything. - I 'm so sorry, Gray. - And you should be. Do you think this is how I wanted to find out that you and India were an item?( STUTTERING) And when were the cameras installed exactly? - Eight months ago. - Eight months? Right. - Everywhere? - Everywhere. We had fun. Yeah, we 're adults. This is true. And while I find your transgressions to be vile, and in some states illegal... You have cameras in the copy room? And audio. But I 'm beginning to think this could actually do us some good. Clearly, nothing positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her presence here gives her power to work against us. Which is why I want you to smooth things over with India. Get close to her again. Find out what she 's up to. Are you asking me to... I 'm saying, do what you need to do. Well, I 'm sorry, but yeah, I 'm a little busy with the Harrod 's collaboration, and... Eli can handle that. That 'll be all. You... So they walk me into the back room of the Roosevelt, mind you, I still think I 'm just going to meet Leo, and out of nowhere, a hundred people jump out screaming " Happy birthday. " Was Leo really there? Of course he was. He 's a great guy. Ah, that 's so nice to hear. Then they bring out this huge birthday cake, and it 's great, but the whole time, I 'm thinking, " God, I wish Scarlett was here. " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris, and I missed her. - Aw. - Aw. This is all going through my mind, I bend down to blow out the candles, and out of the cake pops Scarlett. - No. - I could n't believe it. That is so cute. It was amazing.( SIGHS) I wish it had lasted with her. We 're famous by association. Own it, girl. Jane, has anyone ever told you, you have an Audrey Hepburn quality? Totally. Oh, no, I... You do. It is uncanny. That 's so nice, Mr. Chayse. Call me Aiden. Thank you, Aiden. In her time, Audrey had this certain authenticity that you just do n't see these days. It 's so refreshing to spend time with someone so real. Real as can be. I mean, all you guys, you 're just so much more grounded than all my Hollywood friends. Thanks, man. Hey, what happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah, that 's the one. Yeah. He had something pressing to handle back at the office. I can still see you, Jeremy. Hello, India. How 's life been treating you? You mean, life since I was unjustly fired and kicked to the curb? It 's been spectacular. Just spectacular. Buzz off, Jeremy. Thank you so much, Aiden. You guys took me out. Thank you. REPORTER : Hey, over here, Aiden.( @reporters_clamoring) WOMAN : Over here, Aiden. Hey, who 's that girl with Aiden? I do n't know. But she 's gon na be famous tomorrow. MAN : All right. I thought we talked about you being discreet, Jane. Hmm?( CHUCKLES) Oh, boy. Seriously? This is not being careful. If you 're gon na live a double life, it 's probably a good a idea to try and stay off of Perez Hilton. First of all, It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody even saw this picture. Although they did get my good side. Jane. What? Did you cancel the gorilla-gram? Yes. Do n't try and change the subject. You 're not gon na let this go to your head, are you? It 's just part of my job, Ben. And I 'm not going to let some silly little picture affect me. Can you believe it? - Hey, Jane. - Hey, Harper. So, I was thinking maybe we could do lunch today? You in? - Totally. - I love your glasses. Thanks, Harper. That 's so sweet. See you later, Jane. Hi. What 's going on with you? What? - What do you mean, what? - Hey, can I ask you a question? Do you think I have an Audrey Hepburn quality? A... who... what? Jane? Can I speak to you a minute, please? Now. - We need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photo. Uh-huh, I know. - I do n't know what to say. - Well, I just... You need to be straight with me. Do you think you could get me an autograph? I 'm such a huge fan. Anything for you, Miss Shaw. JANE : So, then he told them with a completely straight face, " I do n't need a parachute. "( @all_laughing) So, anyway, at this point, Aiden thinks he 's just going to meet Leo. And he walks in and like a hundred people... like super famous actor people, and they jump out and surprise him.( @all_laughing) HARPER : You were there? Well, not technically. Oh, Billy! Uh, hang on just a second. Hey. Oh, you 've become quite the celebrity around here, huh? Please, me? Do n't you have work to get to? Of course not. I took the day off. Oh, so, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No, silly. I canceled. For our movie night. Everyone is going. It 's gon na be super fun. Everyone? Jane! Oh, what time are you picking me up? I 'm not. What? Why? ' Cause, I 'm going alone. What are you talking about? I 'm talking about me going alone to the movie tonight. Why are you being this way, Billy? I 'm not being any way. I just want you to have fun. With everyone. Billy... I 'll be fine. I just want to be alone, okay? Rita Shaw?( SCREAMS) What are you thinking, Ben? Rita, hold on, I can explain.( @all_laughing) I canceled you, man!( SIGHS)( DIALING) BILLY : Leave a message. I 'm just going to keep calling you. We ca n't not go together. We 've gone together every year since we were kids. Just call me back. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. ELI : Uh, changed my mind about what? Oh. Eli? Hey. What are you doing right now? Hmm, nothing. Not anymore, you 're not. We are going to a party. Uh, is that right? Yeah, Aiden just invited us. It 's, uh, VIP only, and he wants us there. You and me. Can you believe it? That sounds great, but I ca n't. I mean, I 'd love to, I just...( @doorbell_chimes) Right on cue. Hey, open your door. What is going on? Your limo awaits. And I do n't want to go to this party alone, so... You got anything fancy to wear? I think I can whip something up. - You made it. - Hi. And you look spectacular. Thank you. Uh, new suit? Why do you think it 's a new suit? You think I do n't own suits? Oh, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... I assumed... Yeah, it 's a new suit.( CHUCKLES) You look great. Thank you. I 'm sorry this is so last minute. No, I 'm glad you called. So am I. Listen, I 'm going to go get a drink. Can I, uh, get you something? I 'm okay for now, thanks. - Do n't go anywhere. - I 'll be right here.( WHISTLING)( @doorbell_chimes) Are you ready for a romantic movie night and picnic under the stars...? As ready as I 'll ever be. I thought you were Rita... Uh, Miss Shaw. Dude. I saw her in your T-shirt the other morning. I think I can handle hearing you call her Rita. I thought you and Jane left for the movie already? - She 's not here? - No. What 's going on? I do n't know. She must 've left. That does n't make any sense. Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her I was going alone. And why is that? Because, Ben, I 'm a liability, okay? I 'm the guy people move their purse away from now. It 's exactly how they used to look at my brother. But, you know, that 's just who I am now, and I have to get used to it. But Jane? She 's starting to find her place in school. Her star is rising and mine? Well, it 's crashing and burning. Sit down. - Oh, dude... - Now. - Look, Ben, I think it 's better... - Stop talking and listen. You have to get over this thing. I know your brother, okay? You 've never been like him, you never will be. As far as everyone else is concerned, people make stupid assumptions, and it 's really up to you what you 're gon na do with that. I suggest, suck it up. You go get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane. Because you guys have been a team for as long as I can remember, and I 'm not gon na let you ruin that because you 're going through a tough time. You 've always been there for her. You need to let her be there for you. You need to think more global, youthful, you ca n't let Eli own the new market angle. If you do, you 're dead in the water here. I 'm confused, India. Are you here to help me or sabotage me? I 'm trying to help. I do n't know why I want to help you, but I do. We 're in the same boat, you and me. Is that right? You ca n't see it now, ' cause you 're too close. But it 's perfectly clear what Gray 's doing to you. And what might that be? She 's turning her favor and her focus towards Eli. It wo n't happen all at once, it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will happen. It 's already started. He wo n't last.( CHUCKLES) He 's her nephew. He 's not going anywhere. Whatever, all right? I 'm not worried about some kid. Hmm. That 's exactly what I said about Jane. But as soon as she was Gray 's favorite there was no place for me. What happened to you, it was n't right. But it had nothing to do with Jane. And what happens with Gray, will happen because of me, if it happens at all. You do n't get it. We 're just interchangeable pieces in Gray 's climb to the top. You do n't want what happened to me to happen to you. Humiliated. Disgraced. I 've never felt so small. We walk into the back room at the Roosevelt. Now keep in mind, I still think I 'm just meeting with Leo, right? When out of nowhere, all these people jump out and scream, " Surprise! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The people... And they were behind the curtains, and other places. Anyway, as I was saying... - Having fun, huh? - Not really. This night, it 's... it 's a total mess. Sorry about that. Oh, no, that 's not what I meant. You were the only good part of it, Eli. It 's just... I realized this whole celebrity friend thing it 's... Yeah, it is n't real. No.( CHUCKLES) And I have a real friend. And I let him push me away because I was so swept up in all of this. I should really be somewhere else tonight. For him. Well, the night 's not over, you know. What 's stopping you? Get out of here. I am sorry. I know... Can we just not talk about the gorilla-gram anymore? - Please? - No. I mean, yes. We can not talk about it forever. Billy! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben bought enough popcorn to feed everybody here. Uh, no, thanks, Miss Shaw, but I am looking for Jane, actually. Totally. You should do that. Go surprise her. She 's around here somewhere. Yeah. What? She is. Say what you like, India, at the end of the day, you 're here to kill whatever we come up with, right? I 'm not here for that, Jeremy. Then what are you here for? I 'm here for Gray. I 'm going to ruin her. And I wo n't stop until she 's out on the street with Jane there beside her. India. I want them to crawl. Have you completely lost your marbles? Listen to yourself. No. You listen. And listen very carefully. I 'm going to take down Gray and Jane. Once and for all. And you are going to help me do it. And why would I do that? Because I know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. You were the one feeding Beau Braun our ideas this whole time. You are the reason I was fired. - India... - And if you do n't help me take them out, I 'm going to take you down instead. We could run this place, Jeremy. You and I. All of this can be ours. No Jane. No Eli. No Gray. Just you and me. Complete control. Well? What do you say? Did you do that because you wanted to? Or because Gray told you to keep me close? Does it matter? Not really. - Ben... - Hold on.( SNEEZES) Oh, my God, that is uncomfortable. Ben, we need to talk. All right. These last few weeks, I could n't ask for anybody more attentive. And I really, really appreciate it, but it 's a little too much. The flowers, the bear... Renny. The giant ape-man in my office. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just a bit overwhelmed, Ben. Okay. I just think we need to slow things down a bit. That 's all. Look. I realize I might come on a little strong. But that 's just because I care about you and I want to make sure you know that. So, I 'm sorry, but I do n't want to slow things down. I do. I do n't. Then I 'm not sure where this leaves us. I think... What? I think we need to take a little break. Hey. Hey yourself. I thought that was you. You creature-featuring solo tonight? I was. That is unless you 're down for some creature action. I do n't know about that. I usually prefer my solitude for this sort of thing.( CHUCKLES) Do n't stay on my account. It 's okay. I 'm in it for the Sour Patch Kids. So what do you wan na know about me? How long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you were in prison. Okay, It was n't prison. It was a juvenile detention center. Super scary. I mean, it 's not like it was a country club. No, I was n't allowed to leave. There were some bad guys. Were you one of them? Depends on who you ask. Here. Take my hand. Okay. Now tell me what you observe. Just give me a fact. It can be any random fact you notice. This is weird. Okay, okay. Um... your fingers are extremely cold. - What else? - Hmm. You have unusually tiny knuckles.( CHUCKLES) Okay. Now make two statements about me. One based on what you observed, and the other just on instinct. You like to do cartwheels. And you 're nervous to be at a new school because you think no one can relate. So, how 'd I do? - Beginner 's luck. - Oh, come on. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? - Yeah, it is. Okay. Okay.( CHUCKLES)? I 've got a secret? I 've got a secret to tell? I 'll never keep it? It does n't hide here very well? I 've got a treasure? I 've got a treasure chest? I 've got it buried here forever Hey. I thought you were n't coming. I changed my mind. Billy 's over there if you want to sit with him. Yeah, I did n't want to interrupt. Looks like he 's, uh, made a new friend. How are you two doing? Fine, I guess. Just, uh, trying to get back to normal. Back to the way things used to be. And what about that whole " it 's you " thing? You ask him what it meant? Yeah. Did n't get the answer you wanted? Honestly, I 'm not sure what answer I wanted. All I know is, I saw my best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and that 's a really good thing. Maybe your timing 's just off? Trust me. I know all about that. Wait, where 's Rita? Long story. Know how you warned me not to come on too strong? Lesson learned. You know how you warned me not to let the fame thing go to my head? Lesson learned.? I 'll never keep it? It does n't hide here very well? Another melody? I 've got a treasure( CHUCKLES)? I 've got a treasure chest? Another story to tell? Another secret dream? I 've got it buried here forever? Thrown into a wishing well? In my head? Tonight, tonight, tonight? Tonight, tonight, tonight
