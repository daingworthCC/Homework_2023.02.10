3058441 <p> If Disney 's imagineers ran the place, one of their robotic Abe Lincolns might greet you at the door spouting a snippet of the Gettysburg Address or a snappy " please wipe your feet. " <p> But no high-tech hijinks are needed to invigorate Lincoln Home National Historic Site with the palpable presence of the 16th president and his family. Visitors blessed with even the slightest historical imagination can readily picture Lincoln in the flesh and blood, back inside the only house he ever owned. <p> The sturdy clapboard residence, Downstate Illinois ' most-visited historic site, sparkles these days in the afterglow of a thorough 1987-88 renovation. The work included a fresh exterior paint job of rich Quaker brown, along with new wallpaper and carpeting in brightly colored patterns that 1992 eyes may find positively gaudy. <p> Beginning with Lincoln 's black stovepipe hat hung in the alcove beneath the front staircase, it is easy to imagine the two-story house at Eighth and Jackson full of family love and laughter on a typical December evening in 1860. <p> Lincoln, president-elect of a nation divided, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tousling the hair of youngest son Tad in the sitting room while the maid readies dinner under Mary Todd Lincoln 's vigilant eye. Older sons Robert and Willie are finishing a chore out back. Upstairs, packing is already under way for the impending rail journey to Washington for the inauguration. <p> The Lincoln Home, just a block away from the National Park Service Visitor Center, makes an ideal starting point for a circuit of the so-called Lincoln Shrines. The humanity that echoes from everyday objects such as his shaving mirror and lap desk offers a bracing antidote to any notion that following the Lincoln trail must be a dutiful chore rather than a stimulating pleasure. <p> It 's true that the Lincoln sites suffer from an image problem. Many Illinoisans remember the Springfield-New Salem circuit as a grade-school rite of passage, a slightly musty civics-class obligation - and a bit of a yawn compared to say, Disney World. <p> With only a little preparation and effort on any tourist 's part, however, Lincoln comes to life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tableau could hope to achieve. That should be no surprise, given his enduring appeal as the ever-so-human savior of the Union. <p> Among America 's greatest presidents, it may be hard to identify with the remote and august figure of George Washington or the patrician mien of Franklin Roosevelt. But Lincoln 's character presents a down-to-earth bundle of " skepticism, anxieties, self-doubts, contradictions, loves, laughs, enlightenments, failures and triumphs " - in the words of Stephen B. Oates ' superb biography, With Malice Toward None. <p> Lincoln is said to be the most studied person in American history, and his worldwide stature must be the main reason Springfield ranks in the top 10 among U.S. cities for internationally sponsored visitors. Presumably, he also is Illinois ' best advertisement for itself, because our state 's license plates perennially tout the " Land of Lincoln. " <p> From Springfield, which can honestly bill itself as " Mr. Lincoln 's Hometown, " there are Lincoln sites worth visiting as far as 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and 20 miles northwest at Lincoln 's New Salem State Historic Site. <p> The future president came of age in New Salem, where he arrived as a gangling young man of 22 in 1831 and left for Springfield in 1837 to embark confidently on a career of law and politics. <p> New Salem 's living-history village of two dozen log homes and shops, staffed in season by interpreters in period dress, is the most youngster-friendly of the Lincoln sites. There 's a spanking-new visitor center, where this summer 's productions by the Great American People Show troupe are scheduled for June 19-Aug. 16 on an indoor stage. <p> Two miles north of New Salem, the village of Petersburg was surveyed by Lincoln in 1836. Oakland Cemetery, on the southwest edge of Petersburg, contains the grave of Ann Rutledge, Lincoln 's legendary sweetheart. Her tombstone bears an inscription by Spoon River Anthology poet Edgar Lee Masters, who is buried nearby. <p> Until this spring, a worthwhile stop on the Lincoln circuit was Mt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courthouses where Lincoln appeared before the bench. But this state historic site is closed for the foreseeable future because of the Illinois budget crisis. You still might want to drive past the striking Greek Revival building by taking Illinois 54 northeast from Springfield ; you can then head north on Illinois 121 to Lincoln. <p> The only city ever named for the 16th president during his lifetime with his consent, Lincoln sports a downtown monument in the shape of an ear-to-ear watermelon slice. The melon memorial stands near Lincoln Depot Restaurant, which relates the city 's birth in a menu notation : <p> " On Aug. 27, 1853, Abraham Lincoln witnessed the first sale of lots for the new town of Lincoln, named by the town proprietors in his honor. After the lots were sold, Lincoln christened the new community with juice of a watermelon. " An outdoor plaque tells the same story. Postville Courthouse, open Friday and Saturday afternoons on the western edge of Lincoln, is a replica of another venue where Lincoln tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Dearborn, Mich. <p> If statues strike your fancy, the Abraham Lincoln sculpture in the town square of Clinton( 21 miles east of Lincoln) commemorates an 1848 speech that contained his famous declaration : " You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you ca n't fool all of the people all of the time. " <p> It 's 22 miles straight south from Clinton to Decatur, where another statue in downtown Lincoln Square marks the spot on which the future orator of the Gettysburg Address made what is thought to have been his first public speech. Then 21, he mounted a stump one afternoon in 1830 to make an impromptu speech for Illinois Whig candidates. <p> Back in Springfield, the magnificently restored Old State Capitol displays an original copy of the Gettysburg Address. Lincoln delivered his " House Divided " speech in the old statehouse 's Hall of Representatives and argued more than 200 cases before the Supreme Court. It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150 years ago, it was at least much smaller : The executive, legislative and judicial branches of Illinois government all shared this single building. <p> The degree of your zeal for Lincolniana will determine whether you take time to visit the Lincoln-Herndon Law Offices, where Lincoln hung his legal hat from 1843 until his departure for the White House ; Lincoln Pew, where the family worshipped in First Presbyterian Church, and Lincoln Ledger, his original account ledger with Springfield Marine and Fire Insurance Co., on display at Bank One. <p> But Lincoln Tomb, in Oak Ridge Cemetery north of downtown, is a stop virtually all tourists make. Many of them rub the shiny nose of the Lincoln bust by Mt. Rushmore creator Gutson Borglum outside the circular memorial. They enter to stand respectfully before the red marble sarcophagus, and they may be surprised to learn that Lincoln is not buried in Lincoln 's tomb - strictly speaking. <p> His remains lie a full 10 feet below the floor of the tomb, in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ransom in 1876, 11 years after his assassination. The thieves failed and got 12 months in prison for their conspiracy. But worried officials removed Lincoln 's coffin from the sarcophagus. The public was not informed in 1887 when his body along with wife Mary Todd Lincoln 's was interred in a brick vault beneath the tomb floor. <p> When the tomb was rebuilt in 1902 because the site had settled unevenly, Lincoln 's body was put in a new steel-and-concrete vault 10 feet below the burial chamber. The coffin was opened then, and several former friends and associates signed affidavits that the body was actually his. <p> Lincoln is clean-shaven in Borglum 's bronze sculpture, as he was for most of his life until after the 1860 election. He was growing the beard when the family left for Washington on Feb. 11, 1861, on a train from the Great Western Depot. The restored depot contains exhibits on Springfield 's Lincoln era, including a copy of the resonant farewell remarks he made to a thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> " To this place, and the kindness of these people, I owe everything. Here I have lived a quarter of a century, and have passed from a young to an old man. Here my children have been born, and one is buried. I now leave, not knowing when, or whether ever, I may return. " <p> He did return, in a casket on a funeral train, 4 1/2 years later. Specifically <p> For details, call the Illinois Tourist Information Center,( 800) 223-0121, or the Springfield Convention &; Visitors Bureau,( 800) 545-7300. <p> In Lincoln 's Footsteps, by Don Davenport( Prairie Oak Press, $ 12.95), is a useful guide to the Springfield area 's Lincoln sites, as well as those farther afield in Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky.
