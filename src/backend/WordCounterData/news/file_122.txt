3026041 <p> For a generation that has lived with the legacy of Vietnam, victory in the Middle East may prove satisfying - but disturbing. <p> People are awash in emotions as they see U.S. troops and tanks chewing through the sand in triumph. Some admit to new-found patriotism. Many agree with Rosemary Bowles ' confession : " My ambivalence reigns supreme. " <p> " I was a flower child, " says the 41-year-old psychologist. " I lived in a commune. And that thinking is just the hardest thing to give up. But I 've found a new insight. You have to use your( military) strength.... Listen to me. I ca n't believe I am saying this. " <p> The Vietnam generation " always connected war with everything negative, " says Charles Figley, director of the psychosocial stress research program at Florida State University, Tallahassee. <p> Figley, 46, who served as a Marine in Vietnam, says that experience made us see our country as " flawed, tainted. " But now he sees us shedding that perception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory, he says, will " transform us. We will have a new self-concept as a country. " <p> But for some, victory brings as much confusion as congratulations. " I am under as much stress with the victory as I was through the fighting, " says Steve Preister, 45, of the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy. <p> " I have been mesmerized and anxious through this horrible drama. Now, in victory, what will our role be? How will humiliating Hussein help build the new world order? " <p> The ambivalence reflects the diversity in society, says psychologist Marilyn Ruman, Encino, Calif. " When you feel really committed to something, you have to examine it, " she says. " Most people believe a value worth holding is a value worth examining. This has been a time of examining our values. " <p> While the majority believe U.S. action in the Persian Gulf is justified, she says, " there are still people who believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm glad we live in a country where you can do that. " <p> Michelle S. Coon has her doubts. " The war went so fast, and we did n't lose that many people ; the U.S. is coming out smelling like a rose. No one is really questioning why we 're over there anymore, " says Coon, 21, Cleveland. <p> " Americans are so patriotic and want so badly to believe in the U.S.... When I get scared is when we stop questioning what we 're doing. " <p> But for others, victory is indeed sweet. " We 've come out from underneath the stigma of the Vietnam era, " says Scott Anderson, 25, Missoula, Mont. " We thought we could n't win a war again, but we 've more than proved the fact we can. " <p> He feels his generation has a new reference point - a victory. " We have our own legacy to uphold now. " <p> It is, he says, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to World War II. We won this time. " <p> Television images of the enemy, up close, surrendering, have heightened the sense of ambivalence. Preister says Tuesday 's footage of four Iraqi soldiers giving up " brought tears to my eyes. In their eagerness to kiss the hands of their captors, I was afraid they were going to be shot. That was the human face of the war. " <p> Others say that they feel sympathy - but that death is the price of war. " I really sympathized a lot with them, but it has n't changed my view on what we 're doing over there, " says Laura L. Broderick, 28, Bethlehem, Pa. " If people must die, then that is what has to happen. " <p> Many say this victory will help the nation deal with its nagging guilt about not separating the Vietnam War from the warriors - about not treating returning troops well. <p> " We have had this hangover of guilt, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Association of Boomers. " I have heard a lot of baby boomers asking, ' Why did we blame the troops? How could that have happened? ' " <p> " There will absolutely be a change from Vietnam, " says Shad Meshad, of the Vietnam Veterans Aid Foundation. " These guys will come back winners. They wo n't have to fight two wars - the real war and the postwar period. " <p> But it will be a time of angst for some Vietnam veterans, says Patience H.C. Mason, author of Recovering From the War( Penguin, $ 9.95). " No Vietnam vet will begrudge the welcome home for these troops. It just hurts to remember what Vietnam veterans did n't get. " Baby boomers will regard gulf veterans differently than Vietnam vets, Meredith says. " The boomers are thrilled to death with this victory. And I think they realize there are certain things in life that are worth fighting and dying for. " <p> Ross Goldstein says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shades of gray. " <p> " Psychologically, as you get older, you 're capable of making more subtle distinctions, " says Goldstein, 45, psychologist and author of Fortysomething( Tarcher, $ 18.95). Along with other boomers, Goldstein says, " Early on in our political evolution we took an anti-military position, and now we find ourselves in a pro-military position. That 's new ground for us. " <p> Barry Sherwin, 49, of Media, Pa., worries he 's also waffling. " My Vietnam vet friend called me the other day and said, ' Are you a hawk or a dove today? ' I guess it is much simpler if you just choose, but I find it so difficult. " <p> Robert deMayo, 34, Santa Monica, Calif., psychologist, agrees. The victory " has definitely changed our view of conflict, and our view of military solutions. They are more acceptable to me personally than before Vietnam. " <p> That 's because this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world where things are complex, we rarely get to have a guy in black trunks who 's really wrong, and a real victory. This comes as close as you get. " <p> But when the guy in black trunks is subdued, the ambivalence will continue. The sense of victory " is going to be momentary, " Ruman says, " because we 've got major problems in that part of the world that need to be resolved. " <p> When the guns are silenced, the country will need to celebrate this victory for the sake of its mental health, Figley says. " The bigger the bang( of celebration), the better. We must separate the past -- from the present and the future. We need to acknowledge this has been a very different experience. " Contributing : Robin DeRosa
