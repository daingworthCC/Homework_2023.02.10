3005241 <p> IN her home here the other day, Roseanne Barr was drinking warm hazelnut coffee and talking with her son Jake Pentland about the reality of a man named Ted. This man, Ted, whose last name is Jessup, is a producer Ms. Barr hired to help her create a cooking show. This might seem to qualify Ted as real, if less than cautious in his choice of employers. <p> But Mr. Jessup is also a character in a television series, which is where things get a little meta. And this is where Ms. Barr has come to question whether he is exactly what you and I might call real. <p> Mr. Jessup, who has spent most of his career behind the scenes, will appear as a producer named Ted Jessup on " The Real Roseanne, " a reality show about Ms. Barr 's attempt to create and sell a cooking show. The reality show, which Ms. Barr created with a company called Actual Reality Pictures, goes on the air Aug. 6 on ABC. The cooking show, " Domestic Goddess, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, begins Sept. 20 in the witness protection program called ABC Family, where an actor can disappear. <p> In other television eras, the inverted relationship between the two shows, in which the show is secondary to the show-about-the-show, might have been described as the tail wagging the dog. But in these late days of reality television, it is simply grounds for metaphysical intrigue. Specifically, Ms. Barr wondered whether Mr. Jessup might be a plant placed by a producer of the reality show to sabotage the cooking show -- and thus make good reality television. <p> " They hired people that they thought I would scream at, " Ms. Barr said. " And we did n't see that we were played till we ended up with the unairable pilot show. We 're like : ' Oh my God, I see now why the people they hired were all pretty much incapable. ' " Ms. Barr also used other epithets to describe the pilot, but you will not read them in this newspaper. <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ms. Barr freely hiring Mr. Jessup, even after he says that her cooking show should be about " war and, you know, poisoning the earth and child abuse and class consciousness and racism, " is Ms. Barr 's first adventure in network television since the hugely successful run of " Roseanne. " That sitcom, broadcast from 1988 to 1997, broke ground for its depiction of imperfect blue collar characters and earned Ms. Barr a reputation as a human death star. <p> Without giving too much away, what you see on " The Real Roseanne " is Ms. Barr( who in real life is a smart, driven, possibly vainglorious woman with a prime-time reality show) as an insecure, tentative woman trying to return to television through a low-budget cable cooking show. <p> And what you might see if you went to her home, in a gated community outside Los Angeles, is a woman in a red dress with a puff of doughnut sugar on one shoulder, describing a cast : <p> * The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " including a Beverly Hills matron, a punk rocker and an imperious celebrity. <p> * The Roseanne on the cooking show as leading a below-the-radar search for God. <p> * The woman in the red dress as a new Roseanne, tamed through decades of therapy and meditation inspired by the cabala. <p> * Her co-producer on the reality show, R. J. Cutler, as just the sort of guy who would throw chaos and an incompetent staff at her to watch her react. <p> In a telephone interview, Mr. Cutler, who is producing both shows with Ms. Barr, said that of course he did not deliberately try to yank Ms. Barr 's chakras. " No, absolutely not, " he said. " Sometimes I wondered how happy I was that there was somewhat of a train wreck going on on the cooking show, even though I knew it was giving material for great television. " <p> Mr. Pentland, 25, who is a producer of the cooking show, said one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really existed. During development, he said, people would say to him : " Look, tell us. Tell us right now. Is there really a show? Or is this like a ' Joe Millionaire ' thing? " <p> Such ontological questions are not new to Mr. Pentland. For much of his youth he was asked whether John Goodman, who played Ms. Barr 's husband on " Roseanne, " was a good father. <p> Of course, if you were party to the conversation at Ms. Barr 's home and were a member of the press, it might occur to you that it, too, was a performance -- because that is the nature of celebrity interviews, even when they are presented as real conversations -- and that Ms. Barr has the same motivation for manufacturing conflict that she attributes to her co-producers. That is, six years after her exhibitionistic, often tyrannical behavior wore out both the television industry and the audience, the potential for more of the same is precisely what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, which thrives on showing people at their worst, some people are betting that the promise of Ms. Barr 's worst is still something special. <p> Sitting at a table off the living room, Ms. Barr discussed the question of tyranny with her son. <p> When he was growing up, Mr. Pentland said, he never saw his mother as a tyrant. " It was just hard that her reputation was tyrannical, " he said. Whenever he met people, he said, they felt compelled to remark that he seemed... well, normal. <p> " I 'd love to make a big story out of it, " he said, " but it was n't that bad. Now it 's bad. " <p> " Why? " Ms. Barr asked. <p> " Well, working with you is bad because now you 're tyrannical. Somehow everything 's my fault. " <p> At 50, divorced, the mother of a 5-year-old-son, Ms. Barr negotiated this exchange with a combination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most popular on television, looks chiseled on the site of its former self, reflecting extensive cosmetic surgery undertaken, she has said, to obliterate the image of her father. Her conversation smushes salty profanity with the language of recovery. " I just do n't want to go to hell -- that 's my goal, " she said. <p> It has been more than a decade since being Roseanne meant grabbing her crotch after singing the national anthem at a baseball game and publicly accusing her parents of molesting her as a child, which they denied. Now she described those years in terms germane to reality television. <p> " I could n't tell what was inside or out, " she said. " I could n't tell if it was outside me or inside me or private or public. I just did n't have any boundaries at all. And I do now. " <p> About five years ago, she said, after progress in therapy, she dropped in on her parents, breaking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to a peaceful place with it, " she said. " Some things you ca n't fix, though. " <p> The characters she " does " on the reality show, she said, are the same ones that she once described as multiple personalities and that she said used to torment her against her will. Because she gives no indication that she is " doing a character, " it is impossible to tell where one ends and another begins. <p> The decision to use the characters on the show involved counsel with a higher power. " My shrink said, put them all on there, " she said. <p> Since " Roseanne " went off the air, chased at the end by poor reviews and plummeting ratings, Ms. Barr has tried unsuccessfully to create an American version of " Absolutely Fabulous " and was the host of a syndicated talk show that lasted through two years of middling ratings. <p> For ABC, which previously declined Ms. Barr 's offer to create a " Roseanne " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrea Wong, who gave a green light to " The Real Roseanne " last September, said it was an easy decision, notwithstanding Ms. Barr 's reputation. " Look, she has a legacy on ABC, " said Ms. Wong, who is the network 's senior vice president for alternative series and specials. " She 's a great brand. Everyone thought it made sense. " <p> Ms. Wong said no one at the network had warned her away from Ms. Barr. " I personally have never seen her as a raging tyrant, " she said. Though she would not discuss Ms. Barr 's compensation, Ms. Wong said the show was consistent with the no-star economics of reality television, and cost the network about as much as its other reality shows, including " The Bachelor. " <p> Since the success of " Who Wants to Be a Millionaire " on ABC in the summer of 1999 and " Survivor " on CBS in the summer of 2000 -- both became No. 1 shows -- the networks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedules. But so far this season there have been no reality hits on such a scale. Among the new shows introduced this summer, NBC had a modest success with " The Restaurant " last week, which ranked No. 31 in the Nielsen Media Research ratings, as did CBS with " Cupid, " which ranked No. 34. Both shows were outperformed by reruns of " Friends " and " Will &; Grace. " <p> Ms. Barr 's late arrival to the reality game is an odd fit for the genre. Since she has already exceeded the public appetite for revelation, what is the value of a show that promises to reveal more? <p> " The goal here is not revealing, " Mr. Cutler said. " It 's about telling a story. Here 's a woman who was at the height of the entertainment industry. Now she has a strong need to be in the public eye. What does she do now, and why does she do it? "( Though of course what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, courtesy of a reality show that she runs and that bears her name.) <p> If the essence of reality television is shame, the subgenre of celeb-reality programming relies on playing familiar figures against type. The bat-eating Ozzy Osbourne appears as suburban dad on " The Osbournes " ; the self-deluded M. C. Hammer proves the voice of reason on " Surreal House " ; Private Coolio takes orders on " Celebrity Boot Camp. " For Ms. Barr this means making nice. With " The Real Roseanne, " she said, " I wanted to come back to work and see if I could do it and if it would push my buttons and I would fall into all the old satanic behavior that I used to display. " <p> " But now, " she said, " I 'm like, O.K., I 've got meditation and relaxation, and I just want to live through it and not have my buttons pushed and see if I could do it. " <p> She allowed that this was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or as the, shall we say, force behind the two shows. " You pay a price for being nice -- that 's what I learned, " she said. " You get your choice of being a tyrant and having success or being nice and not. " In three hours of conversation, she described niceness exclusively as a personal quest, not as a solace to the people around her. <p> But reports of her good behavior may be somewhat exaggerated. Mr. Cutler, who described his working relationship with Ms. Barr as smooth, referred only obliquely to the artist formerly known as Satan. " There were some things I heard about Roseanne through her legend, but also we found true during the making of the show, " he said. " Some days she wins her battle, and some days she loses it. On days she loses, it 's less pleasant. " <p> On one of those days, Mr. Jessup joined the long and very real list of producers she has dumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Real Roseanne " faces a bigger conceptual hurdle than the niceness gap. Because Ms. Barr is both boss and subject, the storyteller and the story, there is little space for the crossed purposes that distinguish reality television from professional wrestling. The action feels performed rather than observed, stage-managed even if not scripted. And in Ms. Barr 's case, performed by a professional. <p> In the matter of the reality of Ted, then, it is worth considering some more possibilities : <p> * That when Mr. Jessup, who is very funny, says, " I 'd do a show just making fun of Mormon women, " he is auditioning not just for a job on a Podunk cooking show but for a role on a network reality show. <p> * That Ms. Barr, in hiring him, is not unaware which show pays the bills. <p> * And that the lady-in-red Roseanne, complaining at her Palos Verdes table, did not get to be a former big star by missing tricks. <p> Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar is real. <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
