3051141 <p> Tuesday : Talk about frazzled nerves. Three new designers show premiere collections at Anne Klein, Calvin Klein and Bill Blass today. Also, Vogue 's Andre Leon Tally is spotted at Grand Central Station. <p> In the calm before the storm( Isabel is due to hit New York on Thursday), the weather lightens up, and we get to shed our rain gear for a little while. And out of the closets of the victims come cocktail dresses, gold shoes and more lame than legally allowed in Vegas, all at 10 in the morning. <p> The trend toward pretty continues on the runway -- there is lots of color, shimmer and shine, inventive use of fabrics by almost everybody, including Catherine Malandrino, Peter Som and Narciso Rodriguez. At this point, if I do n't buy a shimmery something very soon, I will just die. <p> 11 a.m. : There were real kisses, not just air ones, backstage for Michael Vollbracht at Bill Blass, who stepped back into fashion after 15 years. On the runway, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Diane Dewitt, have a total blast, especially Cleveland, who twirls and shimmies. She has n't been on an American runway in 17 years, she says, postshow. " I 'm glad girls are wearing skirts again. You feel so businesslike in pants ; there 's less fear in a skirt. " <p> Channeling Blass, Vollbracht puts on an elegant, very pretty show that stays true to the Nancy Kissingers of the world with fluid daywear suits with pleated pants, but does n't forget a younger clientele with a series of beautifully draped and embellished evening gowns. <p> Noon : San Francisco native Peter Som plays up his way with fabric, showing little jackets and mini dresses in hammered satin, crinkle cellophane chiffon, graphic mod florals and flocked-dot chiffon. I like his shrunken jacket made of Guipure lace worn over white cotton canvas stovepipe pants. He and several other designers, like Marc Jacobs, are accessorizing with fabric flower pins. Remember those from a year or so ago? <p> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ebullient than at Blass ; Women 's Wear Daily reports that designer Michael Smaldone is still toughing it out in the fashion world. <p> 1 p.m. : Upstairs at an empty gallery space on West 27th, I take in VPL( Visible Panty Lines), the first collection by the well-known New York stylist Victoria Bartlett. On the set, skateboarders zoom up and around a roller-coaster track, in soft red and blue warm-up clothes. I spot one of Bartlett 's compatriots, Anne Christensen, fashion stylist for the New York Times Magazine, in a swingy pewter satin( note the satin part) mini, a shrunken black denim jacket, white tee and studded high black heels. She is, of course, absolutely up-to-the-minute. Must. Find. Satin. Skirt. For. Self. <p> The show is a kooky collection of underwear that includes Ace bandages on the knees, soft jersey shrunken tees, sheer bikinis worn over thin tees and soft, jersey shorts in reds and blues. <p> 2 p.m. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacobs shows his secondary collection. The AC seems to be on this time around, and the crowd is less rambunctious than Monday night. <p> One skirt, two ways : Vogue editor Anna Wintour arrives early, as always, in a thin tan long-sleeve sweater over a black/pink/blue William Morris printed, softly pleated skirt and high tan heels. Also in the front row, the same skirt goes downtown ; this woman pairs hers with black tights, pink and black high-tops, and a black cap-sleeve tee. <p> Jacobs shows a whopping 56 looks, the first one, a green sweater with scattered hearts, is paired with watermelon satin hot pants, a red scarf, a brown tee and pewter metallic combat boots. There is lots of color here, lots of layering ; the models ' eyes are heavily sparkled and shadowed, and glitter dust falls over their foreheads. There are cute jackets with decals, patchwork jackets, striped tees, pleated minis, Western satin shirts. He mixes metallics with corduroy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Headache coming on from the ear-splitting music at the Marc show. I stay downtown and stroll over to the Fashion Institute of Technology a few blocks away. Got Jacobs on the mind. I ask a group of students what they think of him. Albana Mujaj, a fabric design student, wearing low, low Seven jeans, a pink lingerie top and tan flats, says she does n't see what all the fuss is about. " I love Armani, " she says. Her friend, Rob, an FIT graduate, in a multi-print shirt, a small diamond double C Chanel earring, AG jeans and yellow and black Pumas, pronounces Jacobs " too mainstream. " <p> One after-hours party I 'm glad I missed was the one after Jacobs ' Monday night show, which was, according to student Erika Mercado,( students try to crash as many after-hours parties as they can, she tells me) too crowded, too celebrity-driven and not fun. " The Hilton sisters, " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least a dozen pairs of those cheap Chinese mesh and beaded slippers on the students. I score some at a little shop near the Fashion Institute, three bucks a pair. " You are lucky, " the proprietor says. " These just came in two hours ago. We were completely sold out. " <p> 5 p.m. : Check out the first collection by Allegra Hicks. I like the soft drape of her scoop-neck, knee-length, abstract, heart-print chiffon dress, and the skinny, buttonless teal suede coat. <p> 5:30 p.m. : Twenty-two-year-old Zac Posen holds a small preview of his spring show to be held on Thursday. There 's a camisole with pailettes the color of abalone shells, a celadon stretch leather bolero and a Grecian-style white cocktail dress made of silk ribbon appliqued onto chiffon. There will be no black on the runway this time, he says. I notice that other designers are also using less black than usual. <p> 6 p.m. : A big crowd assembles for the Calvin Klein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big crowd, but less celebrity-driven than in years past, when Dustin Hoffman sat in the front row. This is the first collection Klein did not design ; he was in the audience at the show, which featured the work of Francisco Costas. The girl/woman model, Natalia, opens the show -- smiling -- in a loose brown linen/rayon jacket, a silk knit top and linen short shorts, and tangerine high, high heels( the liner notes say this is a " karung " pump, but nobody seems to be able to tell me what that is.) <p> There are some pretty things, and some strange things, such as a series of papery " cattleskin " leather pieces that were so fragile, one ripped up the back while still on the runway. There were a leather skirt softly pleated like silk, a loose-fitting lambskin coat dotted with laser-cut cutouts, and the final ball gown, the only black piece shown, is very pretty, with fluttery organza leaf-like strips. Colors are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swingy ponytail, faces and lips pale. <p> 8 p.m. : I am " not on the list " at the Narciso Rodriguez show, though I requested a ticket. Neither is most of the out-of-town press, I learned later. I protest, but the staffer with the all-important clipboard of names and the bouncers at the door stand firm. <p> 8:20 p.m. : Dejected and annoyed, I console myself at Grand Central Station 's Oyster Bar, one of my favorite New York places. Surprise! Across the counter is one of fashion 's most respected leaders, Vogue 's Andre Leon Talley, finishing up a piece of pecan pie with whipped cream. He 's on his way to the Narciso show.( Shows always start at least a half hour later than posted.) I fantasize that I can enter the show on his arm, so I tell him my tale of woe. " I 'm so sorry, " he says. And off he goes, in his custom-made Manolos. <p> P.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all around for his slim, corset tops, beautifully tailored crisp linen and silk twill suit with elegant collarless jackets and lingerie-inspired evening gowns with sexy, strappy backs.E-mail Sylvia Rubin at srubin@sfchronicle.com.
