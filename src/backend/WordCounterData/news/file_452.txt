4027441 Now that it has taken over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the federal government owns or guarantees more than half of the nation 's home mortgages - including mine. // To which I say : If Uncle Sam is going to start giving people breaks on their mortgages courtesy of the taxpayer, I 'd like one, too. And so would a lot of other people. Therein lies the slippery slope the government is about to slide down as it decides who will and wo n't get help on their mortgages. On Thursday, just four days after the government said it would take over Fannie and Freddie and guarantee their debt, four Senate Democrats asked the companies ' new overseers to halt foreclosure proceedings on loans in their portfolios for at least 90 days. " The ' timeout ' would give the two companies an opportunity to modify those troubled loans, " they said in a letter. What the senators have in mind is something like what the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is doing with troubled home loans owned by IndyMac Bank, according to New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized IndyMac in July, its chairman, Sheila Bair, immediately halted foreclosure proceedings on loans owned by the Pasadena thrift. On Aug. 20, it announced a plan to " systematically modify troubled mortgages. " // If this is to serve as the blueprint for modifying Fannie and Freddie loans, it 's worth a closer look : To qualify for modification under the FDIC ' s plan for IndyMac, the loan must be a first mortgage on the borrower 's primary residence and it must be owned or securitized and serviced by IndyMac. The FDIC says borrowers must be able to demonstrate financial hardship by documenting their income and must be " seriously delinquent or in default. " It is also willing to work with borrowers who ca n't pay their mortgages due to " payment resets or changes in their repayment capacities. " // Eligible mortgages will be modified into fixed-rate mortgages at the current average rate for conforming mortgages based on a weekly survey by Freddie Mac, known as the survey rate now around 6 percent. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments - including principal, interest, taxes and insurance - do not exceed 38 percent of the borrower 's income. This can be done by : -- Reducing the interest rate, potentially below the Freddie Mac survey rate. After five years, it would go up by no more than one percentage point per year until it hit the survey rate. // -- Extending the term of the loan, perhaps beyond 30 years. -- Principal forbearance. This means " we calculate the payment based on reduced principal, but the full principal is due " when the home is sold, refinanced or paid off, says FDIC spokesman David Barr says. The FDIC will not recoup the interest it foregoes by temporarily reducing the balance. // -- Some combination of the above. The FDIC charges no fee for modified mortgages and is waiving unpaid late charges. // That 's a pretty nice deal for homeowners who qualify. Although I 've never been behind on my mortgage and can handle my payments for now at least, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my servicer owns my mortgage would cut my rate or temporarily lower my balance. // But there 's no help in the offing for people who did n't get into trouble with their mortgages. The FDIC says it is cheaper in the long run to modify mortgages than to put them into foreclosure, and the Democratic senators agree. // " Foreclosures are more costly than loan modifications, according to the administration 's own regulators. It does n't make any sense to rush to foreclosure on people when homes could be saved, and money can be saved to boot, " Schumer said. I hope they know what they 're talking about because every dollar that Fannie and Freddie lose from here on out will be borne by taxpayers. Kevin Stein, associate director of the California Reinvestment Coalition, favors a blanket moratorium on foreclosures. He says many borrowers were victims of predatory lenders and do n't deserve to lose their homes. Nor do tenants living in homes subject to foreclosure. He says all homeowners will benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, which hurt people who need to sell or refinance. But what about people who sat on the sidelines, waiting for prices to come down to a level they could afford? Would n't they benefit from a substantial decline in home prices? " We are also about promoting homeownership for families who can afford it, " Stein says. But he thinks it 's mainly investors who swoop in on foreclosed properties. Realtors oppose it Joel Singer, executive vice president of the California Association of Realtors, opposes a blanket moratorium. " We think a modification is a good solution for that segment of borrowers that could afford a loan if it was modified back to something looking like its original payment, " he says. " But you really need to look at it on a case-by-case basis. In many cases, no modifications could legitimately keep the borrower in the home. They are so far overextended it just ca n't be done. In other cases, people who are in delinquency and foreclosure have made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth less money. Some moratoriums will do nothing other than increase the outstanding indebtedness on the property. That just creates another burden for taxpayers. " Singer says a moratorium will simply prolong the housing market reaching the bottom it must hit before prices can begin going up. " You want to move foreclosures through as fast as you can, " he says. Tom Deutsch, deputy executive director of the American Securitization Forum, also opposes a blanket moratorium on delinquent loans. " It provides an incentive for every borrower to go into delinquency, " he says. " If you know with 100 percent certainty that a loan is going to foreclosure, it make sense to modify if you can get to the point where the borrower can afford it. But it 's very difficult for servicers to gauge whether a loan will go into foreclosure. Every borrower who calls in and says they need to have their loan amount reduced does not necessarily need it, " Deutsch adds. He also believes it simply delays the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Deutsch, whose association members include companies that issue and package mortgage-backed securities among others, admits that investors who bought bonds backed by Fannie- and Freddie-guaranteed loans, stand to gain the most from the government takeover because it transfers potential losses from them to the U.S. taxpayer. However, he says, when investors bought these securities, they expected the U.S. government would step in if they got into trouble. And it did.
