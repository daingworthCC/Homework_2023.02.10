4023341 San Francisco school district officials have pledged to evaluate a dozen schools for seismic safety and to make improvements if they are found to be necessary. // The action was triggered by The Chronicle 's recent discovery of a 5-year-old list that state officials produced after surveying the stability of all California public schools. The state Department of General Services named 12 San Francisco schools that needed inspection based on their architectural plans and construction dates. // While state records show that the San Francisco Unified School District obtained the list in 2005, the schools were never evaluated for their earthquake safety. School officials said last week they had not been aware of the list 's existence. // And although San Francisco school officials say they do not believe the schools pose any danger to students, the district has never completed a comprehensive seismic study of its more than 120 schools - many of which were built decades ago before building codes were changed to reflect modern seismic standards. // Several other local school districts, meanwhile, have conducted thorough assessments and some have passed bonds that set aside money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have this list, which I did n't have in my hands a little while ago, I 'm going to take some action on it, " said David Goldin, chief facilities officer for the San Francisco Unified School District. " Now I will go back and have an engineer look at the buildings and ask is there a concern with it. " Follows city move // The decision to inspect the schools follows a July announcement by the city Department of Building Inspection that it will study San Francisco 's stock of privately owned structures to determine which building types are at the greatest risk of collapse and damage in a major earthquake centered close to the city. // In tandem with that announcement, Mayor Gavin Newsom introduced legislation to waive fees and expedite retrofit permits for owners who voluntarily repair " soft-story " buildings. // The wood-frame structures have weak ground floor walls and are ubiquitous in San Francisco. While their potential danger has been known for decades, city leaders and engineers largely ignored them until recently. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before building code changes in the mid-1970s. Some of those structures do n't have enough steel in their columns and beams to withstand major temblors. // According to Goldin, all of San Francisco 's public schools comply with the Field Act, a 1933 law requiring that school buildings adhere to the codes in existence at the time they were constructed. But that does not mean that all schools meet today 's seismic safety standards. // The Field Act also does not apply to private schools. However, separate state laws enacted in 1986 mandate that newly constructed private schools meet current building codes. In addition, the laws demand that all local governments direct a structural engineer to review school building plans. // Goldin said he does not know why no one in the school district provided him with the state 's list of questionable schools sooner. He noted that he began working for the district in 2005. // School district Superintendent Carlos Garcia declined to comment on the matter and deferred inquiries to Goldin. Other districts took action // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Services, said that a law approved by the Legislature in 1999 led to a statewide survey of public school nonwood frame structures built before 1978. // That year is important because national building codes went through major revisions in the mid-1970s, specifically requiring concrete-frame buildings to include more steel reinforcement in and around their beams and columns and stronger walls. The new codes were adopted for new school construction by 1978. // Lamoureux said the survey was intended to give legislators an overview of the condition of the state 's public schools. In 2006, voters approved Proposition 1D, a $10.4 billion bond measure, intended in part, to help pay for earthquake retrofits. // About five years ago, the state sent each school district a letter to inform them about the survey and invited them to request the lists of their local schools. Lamoureux said that so far, only 100 out of approximately 1,000 California school districts have asked for the list. // But several East Bay school districts - including Berkeley, Piedmont, Alameda, Livermore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed seismic assessments. Berkeley stands out as a model because the school district used local bond money to retrofit all buildings in need of seismic upgrades. // Goldin said that during the next six months he would, at minimum, direct engineers to visit the buildings on the state 's list, review their architectural plans and perform " risk calculations. " // The list of schools is not limited to any particular neighborhood and includes everything from elementary schools to high schools. Other improvements // The school year begins in San Francisco on Monday. Goldin said he is confident students would be safe. // " There is no cause for alarm or hysteria, " Goldin said. " I would put my own children in these schools tomorrow. " // The school district also is undergoing a 90-school renovation to comply with a federal court decision regarding disability access and safety requirements, Goldin said. Any seismic trouble spots identified in that process will be remedied, he said. // Goldin noted that recent renovations at San Miguel Child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for steel brace wall earthquake retrofits. San Miguel was not on the state 's list of schools that should undergo more thorough seismic inspection. // David Bonowitz, a local engineer and seismic expert, said it is a good idea to earthquake-retrofit school structures while performing other repairs because it makes the work less expensive and more time efficient. But he cautioned the school districts not to rely on renovation work to reveal a building 's seismic flaws. // " To find seismic problems you have to be looking for seismic problems, " Bonowitz said. " Making sure that stairways and restrooms are accessible for disabled students does n't mean you 're going to identify a seismic weakness. " The Field Act What is it? On March 10, 1933, scores of brick school buildings collapsed in the Long Beach earthquake. One month later, California Assemblyman Charles Field spearheaded legislation that still requires all new schools to adhere to building codes in effect at the time of construction. State authority : The Field Act and subsequent revisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and approve all public school plans, taking that authority away from local jurisdictions. Code strengthened : The act is not a fail-safe, however, according to structural engineers who focus on earthquakes. Codes are continually revised to make structures safer. As a result, buildings that complied with codes when they were built sometimes are deemed vulnerable later. An example is nonductile concrete buildings constructed prior to major code revisions in the mid-1970s. Although they complied with codes when they were built, many do not have enough steel in their columns and beams to allow them to bend and twist in earthquakes. Instead, their supports can crumble and even explode under too much pressure. Building code changes demanded more steel reinforcement in and around beams and columns, and stronger walls. Therefore, buildings with concrete beams. " " // David Goldin San Francisco school district chief @ @ @
