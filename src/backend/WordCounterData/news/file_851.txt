5023541 <p> So it was surprising to many observers when things got ugly a couple of weeks ago between two of Macomb County 's most well-known politicians, as they threw accusations against each other during dueling news conferences held only 30 minutes apart. <p> " I 've got no animosities. It 's not personal, " County Executive Mark Hackel told the Free Press, after he announced that he was going to ask the state Attorney General 's Office to investigate county Prosecutor Eric Smith. " I 'll continue to have a relationship as long as he 's willing. " <p> Smith, a decades-long friend of Hackel 's, is facing scrutiny over how he spent some of the $1.8 million in four forfeiture funds that have been under his office 's control for many years. <p> Smith, for his part, said he wants the county Board of Commissioners to approve forensic audits of " millions of dollars in contracts " he says Hackel 's office has handed out without " legislative oversight or approval. " <p> Smith passed last week on discussing what happened that led up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagreement and we are seeing eye to eye now. " <p> " Mark and I are seeing eye to eye. We 've always been friends and I consider him a good friend of mine, " Smith said. <p> Smith said he 's like anyone else and has had arguments with friends and relatives, including his brother, Bob Smith, who is chairman of the county board. <p> " We 've always been friends and allies, and nothing has changed, " Smith said of Hackel. <p> The public bickering between the two Democrats surprised several political observers contacted by the Free Press because of Hackel and Smith 's long-standing friendship. <p> " Why this? Why now? " said Ed Sarpolus, founder and executive director of Target-Insyght, a strategic consulting, public opinion and market research firm. <p> Sarpolus said some insiders are thinking there could be more to this than an audit or investigation. <p> Some observers speculated the sparring is political or power politics, but Hackel said he " takes great offense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> He said if there is a problem or there 's information that he needs to pass along, he 'll do it. In this case, he said, the funds are public money and Smith writing checks was in violation of the law. <p> " I will do my job, " said Hackel, adding " the people hired me to do my job... What would you do if you were in my position? It it 's brought to my attention, I have to act on it. " <p> The county board approved a forensic audit of six years of expenses from Smith 's drug and alcohol forfeiture funds, an examination that could take 90 days or longer depending on what receipts are available. <p> The money in the funds is generated from assets from convicted drug dealers and repeat drunk drivers and is supposed to be used for law enforcement purposes. <p> But checks from the funds -- released after two lawsuits related to the Freedom of Information Act were filed -- show tens of thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a security firm, holiday parties, and to churches and nonprofits, in addition to money given to law enforcement agencies. <p> Smith has repeatedly said that all of the checks are law enforcement-related, and that he welcomes the audit. While he said the funds are state funds, he agreed to move them under the county 's umbrella after meetings with state officials last year. <p> Days before the Smith and Hackel news conferences, commissioners agreed on UHY Advisors to perform the audit, but the firm was nixed the next day when they learned that members of the firm had ties to Hackel 's campaign. <p> Four days later, Hackel 's office called a news conference to request the AG 's office to investigate. Smith also called a news conference 30 minutes earlier, where he questioned $9 million in overruns and contracts for a renovation project of county buildings in Mount Clemens without county board approval. <p> The overrun was first raised in a response to a lawsuit Hackel 's office filed last year against the county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens advisory committee. The board fired back in a counter-complaint, questioning the overrun by Hackel 's office for a building contract it did n't approve. <p> There has been tension between the board and the executive 's office in the past as the two have squabbled about financial matters since the executive form of government took effect in 2011. A separate power struggle in 2012 landed both sides in court. <p> At his news conference, Smith said he was calling on the county board to audit the executive and treasurer 's offices. As of Friday, the board has not received any request from Smith. <p> The county board decided to go with Michigan-based firm Yeo &amp; Yeo to handle the forfeiture fund audit at a cost of up to $100,000. Bob Smith abstained from the vote, and the firm is not known to have any ties to any politicians in Macomb County, officials said. <p> Kelly Rossman-McKinney, communications director for the Attorney General 's Office, said Friday that her office does n't have any official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request to investigate the forfeiture funds. <p> County Corporation Counsel John Schapka said an email was sent, but more detailed information is to be forwarded. The county board also sent a letter, indicating a firm was being selected and upon completion, the outcome and findings report would be forwarded to the office to review. <p> Hackel said he and Smith have been friends for decades, and their two families have always gotten along. <p> They 've been out socially and together have publicly supported political candidates, including Steve Bieda, who ran in the Democratic primary for county clerk, and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, with the two appearing in a Facebook video endorsing her at a doughnut shop in Warren last year. <p> Hackel, who formerly served as sheriff, has thought about running for governor in the past, but last year won re-election as executive for four more years. <p> Smith has been prosecutor since being first elected in 2004, and last year reportedly declined a request to run for attorney general, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his young children 's lives and activities. <p> His office, as well as several other countywide offices, will be up for election next year in a county known as the home of the Reagan Democrats, but one that political observers believe is changing -- including in the areas of demographics and politics. <p> Macomb County went for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election and several other Republicans were elected to countywide offices. Separately, the county has been under the microscope of federal investigators in a wide-ranging, pay-to-play corruption probe that has targeted officials and others across the county. <p> " I 'm not looking to gain anything from it professionally, politically or personally out of this. I 'm just trying to do my job, " Hackel said, adding that he ca n't ignore something because of friendships or relationships or because " it might go against the grain politically. " <p> " If I 'm not doing something I should be doing, it does n't settle well with me, " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship with myself. " <p> Hackel also was vocal about a court filing against now-ousted County Clerk Karen Spranger, also a Republican. Last year, a St. Clair County judge ruled that Spranger lied on paperwork to run for office in 2016 and removed her from office -- an office that was under constant chaos during her reign. <p> Target-Insyght 's Sarpolus said the recent public fighting between the two officials told him they 're " stepping on each other 's toes. " <p> He said that he believes the two can be friends again -- if they want to.
