3070341 <p> As soon as Heather Wright bundles Cage and Fenno into the car, their hoots and howls of excitement grow giddy and urgent. " All right, all right, I 'm going as fast as I can boys, " grumbles Wright, a 37-year-old technical recruiter. Cage whimpers and tries to climb into her lap. When the car finally pulls up to Mile High Mutts in downtown Denver, the 2- and 3-year-old chocolate- colored Weimaraners frantically yank on their leashes. <p> Once freed, Fenno and Cage bolt inside and do n't look back. <p> A welcoming chorus of playmates darts and circles about them. <p> Then the door closes. <p> In the past two years, doggy day care has become one of the fastest growing pet-related services in Colorado. <p> Facilities are popping up everywhere along the Front Range - answering a need in a pet-friendly state where 44 percent of households own at least one dog. <p> " If I need to, I know( day care) will tolerate me calling if I want to know how they are doing, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Denver Tech Center. " They let me call as many as two times a day when I 'm out of town and worried about them. I 've only cried or got weepy once. " <p> Nineteen full-time doggy day cares are now licensed in Denver ; eight opened this year, said Diane Milholin, vector control coordinator with the Denver Division of Animal Care and Control. <p> Downtown Denver 's doggy day- care market is close to saturation. <p> Nearly 50 doggy day-care facilities operate from Fort Collins to Pueblo, with more planned in the southern suburbs from Centennial to Castle Rock. <p> To meet the demand, the nation 's first doggy day-care franchise, Camp Bow Wow, plans to open five new centers in the coming months - one each in Cherry Creek, Fort Collins, Vail, Loveland and Greeley. <p> Bells and whistles such as Web cams( where watchful pet owners can go online to check on their dogs), outdoor pools, obedience training, and even dog-oriented movies and classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " We love our doggies here in Colorado, " said Heidi Flammang, owner of Camp Bow Wow, 1221 S. Cherokee St., in Denver. <p> " Our customers do n't blink an eye at spending $25 to $35 for a day or overnight stay, " she said. " We are selling franchises all over the United States, but they are really taking off in certain pockets of communities like Denver where people humanize their pets and believe that leaving them at home is neglectful. " <p> Primarily, doggy day-care clients are single or are DINKS - dual-income earners with no kids - who have disposable cash to spend on luxuries. Their pets are the " kids " they nurture. <p> " I do n't have children ; it just has n't happened for me, " said Wright. " My maternal instincts are for my dogs. " <p> Wright takes her dogs to Mile High Mutts, 2450 Larimer St., twice a week. <p> Most clients send their dogs to day care two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $22. That 's a monthly bill of about $200 to $300, said Deb Steinberg, who opened the first doggy day-care center in the metro area. <p> Those who choose to have their dogs in day care five days a week dole out $500 a month. <p> That 's compared to the average $600 a month parents pay to keep children ages 2 and up in child care, said Kathryn Hammerbeck, executive director of the Colorado Child Care Association. <p> Doggy day care might have been a laughable concept for many people in 1991 when Steinberg opened Doggy Day Camp, 15141 E. Fremont Drive, in what would later become Centennial. <p> Steinberg was lucky enough to have 10 clients after mailing 2,000 fliers. Then, pet owners tended to take a more casual view of their dogs. Today, dog owners care for their pets as extended family members. <p> Americans in 2004 spent $34.4 billion on pets, from faux mink coats to ID-protecting microchips, according to the American Pet Product Manufacturers Association. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. City Bark-Denver, 370 Kalamath St., has a waiting list, but owner Nicole Delmoro said traffic will ease when she opens a third center closer to downtown this month. <p> Pet owners understand there are alternatives to allowing a bored, unsupervised dog to stay home alone, suffer from separation anxiety, bark all day, dig in the yard, eliminate in the house or destroy things in search of something to do. <p> " Cutter would escape out of his crate, eat shoes, tear up the carpet, " said Katie Kraskey, a 27-year-old real estate agent who owns the 2-year-old Swiss mountain dog and beagle mix. " He has more energy than I know what do with. " <p> A behaviorist recommended doggy day care as an intermediary step because Kraskey did n't have time to extensively train with Cutter. <p> " Dogs are social animals, and being by themselves for a large part of the day can be a big stressor, " said Suzanne Hetts, a certified applied animal behaviorist with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office space in Den K9 9 Daycare, 8700 W. 14th Ave., which opened this year in Lakewood. <p> Doggy day care can be a positive experience if the dogs are properly supervised to prevent fights and bullying, she said. <p> " It 's great for puppies to get them socialized and help with house training, " Hetts said. " The dogs tend to come home tired, and they can rest when their owners are ready to come home and rest. " <p> " When Polly gets home, she sleeps all the next day, " said Jeff VanderMolen, 28, a construction worker in Denver who owns the 21-month-old black Lab mix. " When I come home from work, I literally have to drag her out of her crate. " <p> Colorado has some of the strictest and most detailed licensing regulations imposed by any state to keep doggy day- care facilities safe, said Dr. Keith Roehr, an assistant veterinarian with the state 's Department of Agriculture. <p> The animal welfare committee of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and animal care facilities program as a national model, Roehr said. <p> Colorado also is the only state that has an association devoted to doggy day-care facilities, said Cristal Newell, owner of two Mile High Mutts centers, in Lower Downtown and Park Hill. <p> Because doggy day care is hot, traditional service providers such as veterinarians ' offices and kennels are adding day care to their service packages. <p> About 30 vet clinics and kennels in the metro area now include some form of day care or scheduled play time for pets. <p> " The whole industry is being changed by this day-care concept, " said Jim Krack, executive director of ABKA, formerly known as the American Boarding Kennel Association, an international trade association for pet-care service providers. <p> The association just added day-care businesses to its active membership a year and a half ago. <p> " It 's not nonsense, " Krack said. " It 's a reflection of what people expect and want for their pets in today 's society. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Savvy entrepreneurs also have discovered that the new trend in doggy day care is training others how to create one. <p> Books and informational DVDs are being sold about starting a doggy day care with an initial investment of $30,000, compared with the $1 million often needed to establish a boarding kennel. <p> Professionals - mostly women - are turning away from high-powered careers to start their own day-care services. <p> The financial awards are n't great. Regular dog handlers make $7 to $9 an hour, while facility managers pull in between $10 and $14, said Newell, with the state dog day-care association. <p> Those salaries are comparable to what child-care workers make. Lead teachers earn an average $8 to $12 an hour, while their aides make $6 to $7, said the child-care association 's Hammerbeck. <p> Flammang left a career in sales and financial planning to open the first Camp Bow Wow in Denver in 2000. <p> Nicole Delmoro was a public accountant who could n't leave behind a childhood love of animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I dreamed about becoming a dog walker and spending entire days just playing with dogs, " said Delmoro, who quit her job to open City Bark. <p> " When I became aware of doggy day care in 2000, I liked the fact that for very little more money than you 'd pay for dog walkers, your dog could get a lot of exercise, and owners would n't need to feel guilty about working long hours, " she said.
