3067641 @ @ was 7 when we went to Ireland together in 1986, to walk the bogs of County Mayo in the west. His maternal great-grandfather, Martin Carey, had been born and grown to ruddy manhood there. And there he 'd built a two-room cabin from the stones that lie thick as farmers ' curses on the land. <p> Sean stood in the doorway of the roofless ruins of the cabin, under the stone lintel where Martin had chiseled the date 1913. <p> And he listened to his cousin Michael Moran tell the story about how, one day 73 years before, Martin had shut that door. About how he 'd struck off north through the heather, rucksack on his back( " and he 's whistlin ', says his wee sister Annie, who was runnin ' behind "), to the rail line on the low ridge( " and the tracks that carried dead men to their graves and live men to their futures, the tracks are gone long since now "). <p> About how, as the train slowed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 20 miles to Westport and the boat that 'd take him to England, to the ship that 'd take him to the United States " and never came back home. " <p> At age 7, Sean seemed at home there in the stones and purple heather of Mayo. A thick Irish wool sweater, sweetly redolent of lanolin, warmed him against the wind and misty rain that blew off Clew Bay. <p> The freckles that lay thick across the bridge of his nose and spread to round, red cheeks marked him as one of them - as some part of Martin who, in the end, had returned. <p> Michael put his hand around Sean 's shoulder and led him inside the cabin 's crumble. He pointed to a linden tree growing in a corner. <p> " After your great-grandfather left, " Michael said, " this was the place your cousin Father Tom lived for a time, grew up here, prayed every night here in this place that was his bedroom. Right there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed where he knelt and prayed t'God and got his vocation t'be a priest. <p> " And the tree grew right there, like some sign. A miracle, it is. Just a wee miracle. The family 's miracle. And that tree 'll never be cut, I 'll tell ye. When ye come back home here again, ye 'll see. Ye 'll see. " <p> OUR FAMILY 'S traveling has filled Sean 's life with little miracles : sights and smells, sounds and feelings, and stories that have shaped his personality and formed his understanding of the world - and of himself - no less than a miracle of biblical proportions might have. <p> His burning bush may have been the eye of a humpback whale staring at him from less than 10 feet away in the waters of southeast Alaska, and the greasy, fishy smell of its breath that washed over him in the spray of its spout as it dived. <p> His manna has taken many forms : the habaneros chiles we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mixed with tomatoes, onions and lime to make xnipic, or " dog 's nose, " the incendiary Mayan salsa. There was the marzipan bear that a round, rosy Bulgarian woman gave him at a stall in Sofia 's marketplace ; the walnuts we cracked and shared for lunch with beet-field workers in Transylvania. <p> Just as miraculous have been the papayas and mangoes and coconuts we 've eaten right from trees in Hawaii - not to mention the berries we 've foraged and feasted upon in the Cascades and Olympics. <p> Sense of humanness <p> Traveling has taken him " home " many times over since he was 6, to 10 different countries and 17 states so far. <p> It 's that broad definition of home he 's nurtured - a sense of humanness that stretches the boundaries of cultural and geographical identity - that 's probably the most heartening lesson of his experiences. <p> Certainly, in Ireland, the sense of homecoming was immediately palpable. And in the Hungarian village where his paternal grandfather was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that seemed to rise less from a conscious acknowledgement of our roots than from something deeper, more primal : as if in our bodies there was buried a memory of the place and the people who embraced us. <p>( He was 6 when we visited Hungary. And after a week in the village, as we drove away back toward Budapest, he cried and said he did n't want to leave. And when he talks about the place now, it 's with something much like homesickness.) <p> But he seems to have laid roots in most places we 've traveled - a network of entanglements that will always tug and connect him to places and people far from the taproot he 's sunk, deep and permanent, in the Pacific Northwest. <p> Travel a legacy <p> It 's become as important for me to foster and watch and try to understand that process as it is for me to cultivate my own system of roots and tendrils. <p> I am, after all, a father - with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Sheila and I are building for him. From weekend trips to the mountains, the rain forest and the coast to longer trips across country or overseas every couple of years, we 've begun to build a sense of family, of community, that he, in turn, will pass on to whatever children he may have. <p> The time and money we 've spent, even the sobering debt we continue to accrue to feed that trust, already are accumulating dividends far beyond what we imagined when we began traveling as a family. <p> For us, traveling is less casual recreation or leisure time than a priority, an important thread in the fabric of our lives - a seam even. It joins us to the world. <p> Freckles have faded <p> Sean 's 15 now. Traveling with him has changed. The freckles have faded and the round cheeks have been absorbed into a long, slender and even sometimes sullen adolescent 's face that no longer tempts affectionate pinches from motherly merchants, much less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead in an Irish wool sweater. <p> At night in hotel rooms or in our sleeping bags, our talks about history and culture and plants and animals often segue mysteriously into discussions about rap and grunge, movie plots, the friends he 's missing, and girls - wee miracles of a different sort. <p> An acceptance of wonder <p> As we lie there, I often fall asleep wondering what he 'll really remember of all this, how he 'll remember his father after all the secrets we 've shared, his secrets and mine - about my fears, my disappointments, my doubts and dreams, all the things I 've always wanted to do but never have and, maybe never will. And I wonder what kind of man he 'll be. <p> I think I have some idea. There 's this quality about people who travel. Innocence is one word to describe it - not naivete, but innocence : a comfortable acceptance of wonder, perhaps. The kind of curiosity that replaces surprise at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling at home. The quality of accepting miracles as they come. <p> We were diving together in the Caribbean off the island of Cozumel last year, in shallow water where a small reef had begun to disperse into a wide shelf of sand that stretched toward shore. <p> Isolated in meditation <p> As I was busily exploring crannies for lobsters and puffer fish and scaring up small sting rays along the bottom, I watched him hover, motionless about 10 yards off for long minutes, isolated in a kind of meditation. <p> Finally, I swam over and saw next to him, hovering at the same angle, a yellow and blue knife blade of a fish, about 8 inches long. He pointed to it and smiled. <p> When we left the water, he wore the same kind of dreamy, contented expression that I remembered seeing when we walked the rolling moors of Devon in southern England when he was little, and when we lay on our backs looking up at the stars on a clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand tilefish, " he said. " It was n't afraid of me. We just floated there together next to each other, looking at each other. I felt as if I belonged there, as if it felt I belonged there, too. <p> " I love feeling like that, being in a place I 've never been before, someplace totally strange, and feeling like I belong there. " <p> He 'll be that kind of man, I think. <p> Jim Molnar was named the Lowell Thomas Travel Journalist of the Year 1991-93 by the Society of American Travel Writers Foundation.
