4186141 <p> Oregon offensive lineman Zach Okun was taken to a Springfield emergency room Wednesday after an ambulance was called during the Ducks ' morning practice in Eugene, but Okun has since left the hospital. <p> A nursing supervisor at PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center at Riverbend said late Wednesday evening that Okun is no longer a patient. Okun arrived in the emergency room in the morning and stayed until late afternoon, but a hospital spokeswoman added late Wednesday that the redshirt freshman lineman was never eventually admitted to the hospital. <p> Because Okun was not formally admitted, his condition was never released, but his apparent departure from the hospital suggests the injury was perhaps a scare. <p> Okun 's family declined to comment Wednesday evening. <p> An ambulance was called to Oregon 's athletic department at 11:29 a.m. and transported a football player to Riverbend for " precautionary " reasons, UO spokesman Todd Miles said, and hours later after the Ducks ' second workout of the day, offensive line coach Steve Greatwood told reporters Okun had undergone an MRI.
