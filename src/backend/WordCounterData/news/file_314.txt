3053541 <p> The challenge of attacking a Japanese submarine carrying a high military leader fell to PT boat skipper Jack Searles. <p> U.S. code breakers eavesdropping on enemy radio transmissions learned the exact time and place planned for the sub to deliver the leader to Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific. <p> The only U.S. naval vessels available then to attempt to liquidate the enemy leader were PT boats stationed at the nearby island of Tulagi. This would be one of the most notable missions carried out by these storied craft during World War II. <p> PT stood for " " Patrol Torpedo. " The Navy would deploy about 800 of these swift, mahogany-hulled boats, using them in every theater but most notably in the Pacific. One would carry Gen. <p> Douglas MacArthur to safety from besieged Corregidor in the Philippines. John F.Kennedy, later president, would command one, PT-109. <p> Under normal circumstances the operation Searles headed would have been led by a squadron commander scheduled to make a patrol that night of Dec. 9, 1942. But, Searles explained, that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sub. <p> This officer, an U.S. Naval Academy graduate and career Navy man, feared that failing to liquidate what the top Navy brass had described as a " " big( Japanese) SOB " would mean low efficiency ratings and seriously hamper his chances for advancement. <p> He explained these concerns to Searles and asked him to take the job. Searles, then 27, a reserve officer with no such worries, readily agreed. <p> That night, Searles ' boat and a second boat commanded by Frank Freeland were at the spot designated by the code breakers, one mile off Cape Esperance on the northwest corner of Guadalcanal. <p> Right on time, Searles recalled, the massive submarine surfaced. Freeland, forgetting he was n't supposed to break radio silence, blurted, " " Look what I see. " The sub immediately dived. <p> At that point a Japanese barge, clearly sent to meet the sub, approached. As Freeland 's crew raked the barge with machine guns, Searles moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resurface. <p> As Freeland 's men reloaded their guns, the submarine came up between the two PT boats. " " What do I do now? " Freeland radioed. <p> Searles said he replied, " " Put cotton in your ears. There are two fish( torpedoes) on the way. " <p> One torpedo slammed the sub, causing it to explode and sink. <p> The other passed under Freeland 's boat. Searles, of Davenport, Iowa, said he thinks only one member of the sub 's crew survived. He could never learn the identity of the high Japanese military official. <p> But he sent Adm. William F. " " Bull " Halsey this message : " " Met and sank sub with torpedo. One less Big( Japanese) SOB. " He received the Navy Cross, and the other nine members of his crew each received the Silver Star. <p> There is a sad footnote because Freeland was killed the night after the sub encounter. <p> Jack Searles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served on two of the first four PT boats sent to the Solomons, arriving there in October 1942. Their crews had much to learn. For instance, said Bob Searles, then 23, a skipper like his brother, " " No one had trained us to attack a cruiser or a destroyer in the middle of the night. " <p> On his first night patrol, Bob Searles said, he fired two of his four torpedoes at a Japanese cruiser. One struck home. He immediately ordered the firing of his other two torpedoes, but for some reason, maybe the tropical climate, they stuck in their tubes. <p> He was concerned that the torpedoes ' arming mechanisms might be priming them to detonate. Only seven pounds of pressure could set them off. He directed his torpedoman to find a way to stop the arming wheels from turning. <p> The torpedoman, assisted by gunners, accomplished that in a unique fashion -- by stuffing toilet paper in the projectiles. <p> Another PT boat commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his torpedoes would n't fire, his torpedoman " " would hit them with a hammer to awaken them. " <p> Prescott, a retired chairman of the art department at the University of Texas at Austin, still marvels at the speed and maneuverability of PT boats, powered by three Packard aircraft engines that could generate top speeds of about 45 knots, or more than 50 mph. <p> " " I can not describe the pleasure and pride that steering those fast boats gave me, " he said. " " Outside of racing speedboats nothing on the water could touch us. " <p> In the main, said Prescott, then 22, his crewmen " " were kids just out of high school. Many had been football or basketball players. We knew we were good. We knew we could win. We thought we were invincible. <p> " " At the same time, we were floating firebugs in midships carrying all this aviation gas. Get a bullet in there, and it was bad news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " <p> Clyde Combs of Houston, like virtually all who served on PT boats, volunteered for that duty. His newly formed squadron was heading for the Pacific when diverted to England for the D-Day invasion of Normandy, June 6, 1944. <p> In some later night actions, said Combs, then 19, his boat duelled with the German version of the PT boat. Bigger and more heavily armed, they were called E-boats. Once an 88mm shell fired by an E-boat knifed through the bow of his boat just above the waterline but luckily did n't explode. His boat sped to a floating dry dock for repairs. <p> Tom Tenner of Houston, a quartermaster, also loved taking a PT boat 's wheel. " " I 'd do it any chance I got, " he said. " " To be in control of that much power was pretty neat. " <p> During night missions in the Philippines, his boat often went after barges the Japanese used to transport troops. After sinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used pistols and submachine guns " " to pop heads in the water until they were all gone. " <p> Once an order came to capture a prisoner for interrogation. <p> " " We waited until there was just one left in the water, and I was assigned to pull him in, " he recalled. " " Everybody was concerned about making him comfortable. Then somebody decided we better search him. We found he had about five hand grenades strapped to him. " <p> Still, by this time, Tenner said, the prisoner 's main aim appeared to be surviving, not blowing up Americans. <p> Jack L. Fons of Casper, Wyo., recalled a night that two Marines asked to go along on a night mission of his PT boat in the Solomons. As his boat headed for a couple of barges off the coast of Bougainville, Japanese artillery on shore opened up on it. <p> Later, 164 shrapnel holes were counted in the vessel, but only one slight wound to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PT boat got close to the barges. <p> " " We actually were so close to them that our machine gunners were pointing their guns downward right into the barges, " said Fons, the vessel 's executive officer. " " We killed quite a few Japanese and sank the barges. The Marines with us were wide-eyed watching this operation. " <p> In 1945, Jack Fons, then 25, helped oversee the decommissioning of PT boats in the Philippines. A few that were in perfect condition were spared, he said, but the rest were destroyed. <p> " " After the engines and other equipment were taken out, the boats were pulled over on the beach and set afire with flamethrowers, " he said. " " I can still see some of the PT boaters watching their boats burn with tears in their eyes. " <p> TYPE : Series
