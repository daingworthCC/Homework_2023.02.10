3027041 <p> Cincinnati Reds manager Davey Johnson returned to Shea Stadium Memorial Day weekend and saw new Mets skipper Dallas Green playing catch near the mound. <p> " I know what he 's probably going through, and I do n't know whether to offer him congratulations or condolences, " said Johnson, who had Green 's job for six-plus years. <p> New York : <p> It turned Bobby Bonilla 's smile to a scowl in three months. <p> It sent Jeff Torborg, the perfect Mets manager 18 months ago, to the help-wanted ads in 200 games. <p> It chewed up New York Giants coach Ray Handley for two years before he was mercifully fired. <p> Is it the toughest place to play? Do New York teams need players/coaches with a certain mentality? And does that make it harder to win there? <p> " It 's an extra layer to the job, " said Mets general manager Al Harazin diplomatically, himself often a talk-show target these days. " Some people thrive on it, some do n't and most are in between. " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, aggressive media corps. <p> A powerful 24-hour sports talk radio station. <p> Knowledgeable fans who exemplify the city 's toughness and cynicism. <p> And you must win because you are n't the only game in town : The metro area has nine pro sports teams in four major leagues. Each has a same-sport rival within 30 miles. <p> " Any time you 're in a two-team city, you 're going to have competition, " Green said. " Winning is maybe more of a focus point here. " <p> Players and managers who have been successful in New York say it 's just a matter of blocking out the distractions. <p> " If you 're going to play in New York, you need to be able to let some water run off your back, " Yankees first baseman Don Mattingly said. <p> Added Mets pitcher Dwight Gooden : " If I 'm a GM or whatever, when a player comes here, I 've got to get the total package. Not just the stats, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that more needed than with a millionaire free agent. For the most part, New Yorkers show more patience to out-of-town motorists on Seventh Avenue. <p> " There 's so many expectations put on them( incoming stars). Then they try to do too much, and that 's when they really mess up bad, " said former pitcher Ed Whitson, who joined the Yankees in 1985 with a five-year, $ 4.3 million contract. <p> Whitson knows - his is the most prominent example of New York meltdown. The pressure of pitching amid the boos in Yankee Stadium became so intense in 1986 manager Lou Piniella decided to start him only on the road. <p> Whitson 's case was an extreme, but the scenario is not uncommon. Bonilla, who boasted upon signing about the fun of playing in New York, was wearing ear plugs by midseason last year. He said it was to block out noise from the low-flying jets, not the high-volume boos. Then, he called the press box from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - and got caught trying to cover it up. <p> He broke two of the cardinal rules of surviving in the Apple : do n't get preoccupied with the media or fans and do n't try to snow ' em. <p> " The big key here is to be straight-forward, " said WFAN talk-show host Mike Francesa. " When you run and hide is when things fall apart. " <p> Added Giants GM George Young : " The best way to keep a secret in New York is do n't have any. " <p> Gooden said some some players give too much attention to the media and fans " instead of being more concerned with the team in the other dugout.... You start taking that out on the field, now you 're playing against three teams. " <p> Some of it can be hard to ignore ; the city can be cruel. Whitson said he received so many threats from fans he feared for the safety of his family. Indiana Pacers rookie Malik Sealy, from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone booth at JFK Airport and the fireman who found it turned it over to WFAN - and thousands of listeners. And the back-page headlines of the tabloids are about as subtle as a chainsaw. <p> " This city gets too full of itself sometimes, " Yankees broadcaster Tony Kubek said. <p> But most players and management say it really does n't make it harder to win in New York. It just makes it worse when you lose. <p> " They accentuate the negative when you start struggling, and because there 's so much coverage, everything gets magnified, " said former Met and ESPN analyst Ray Knight, now a coach with the Reds. " Reading the stuff day in and day out creates a negative atmosphere... and it ends up killing you. " <p> It is n't necessarily tougher than Boston or Philadelphia, just louder. <p> " I think the biggest thing here is there 's more of us. We 're everywhere you turn, " WFAN 's Chris " Mad Dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans in this town will not support a bad team. " <p> The effect of it all? Opinions vary. <p> Some, like Young, feel too much is made of it : " Everything seems bigger than life in New York. I do n't know if it 's that much different. " <p> " It 's only as tough as you want it to be, " said Mets reliever John Franco, a Brooklyn native. <p> Mattingly said most of his teammates over the years have enjoyed playing in New York. The fans can be just as much a positive influence ; when you 're winning, the atmosphere is charged. <p> Even Bonilla, for all his problems, has started to hit and is on a 40-home run, 100-RBI pace. <p> " You wo n't be happier than when you 're beating people 's brains out here, financially, emotionally, mentally, " Johnson said. <p> He wo n't discuss his rocky return to his hometown. But it 's unlikely he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frown. <p> " You 'd better not say it 's not going to affect you, like Bobby did, " said Knight. " It is going to affect you until you learn to deal with it, because you have no clue what it 's like. You can imagine, but until you 're there, you have no clue. " <p> Some regrettable quotes The promise of stardom in New York, and the pressure of performing there, can make even the most polished player or club executive say things he 'll regret. A sampling of infamous quotes from the last few years : <p> " I know you all are gon na try, but you 're not gon na be able to wipe the smile off my face. I grew up in New York. I know what it 's all about. " - Bobby Bonilla, Dec. 5, 1991, after signing a contract with the Mets. <p> " Do n't make me shut you all out. You just do n't give a( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go about your business the right way, fellas. " - Bonilla, March 11, 1993, threatening a boycott of reporters after a story quoted unnamed teammates criticizing his spring-training work ethic. <p> " I 'll hurt you. I 'll show you the Bronx. " - Bonilla, April 10, 1993, to New York Daily News reporter Bob Klapisch, upset with a book by Klapisch and John Harper, " The Worst Team Money Could Buy. " <p> " Our biggest mistake was not doing a better job of keeping it out of the papers. " - Mets general manager Al Harazin, April 27, 1993, after pitcher Dwight Gooden missed a start because of a bruised shoulder suffered when outfielder Vince Coleman accidently hit him while practicing swinging a golf club. <p> " It looks like it 's become paranoia, and maybe it is. " - former manager Jeff Torborg, April 27, 1993, on the club 's attempt to cover up the incident. <p> " If I play well in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " - Coleman, Dec. 5, 1990, after agreeing to a four-year contract with the Mets. <p> " You 're going to write what you want anyway, so why are you asking me? Why do n't you ask me about baseball one time? " - Coleman, April 27, 1993, to reporters questioning him about the Gooden accident.
