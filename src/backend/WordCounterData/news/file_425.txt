3071541 <p> The butt bruises were still fresh in the Cubs ' clubhouse one day after the Arizona Diamondbacks punted them from their three-and-out playoff series. But as they headed out to their winter homes Sunday, players said this core group is n't done contending for a World Series title. <p> Maybe even next year, in the 100th-anniversary season of the Cubs ' last one -- whether general manager Jim Hendry adds reinforcements over the winter or not. <p> " The time off with the family will be nice, but I look forward to getting back to Mesa for spring training, " second baseman Mark DeRosa said. " The young guys got a taste of winning a division and being part of high-pressure games, and the nucleus of leadership that 's here is only going to get better. Everyone is upset, but if you look at the big picture, this is definitely on the right track. " <p> As manager Lou Piniella said Saturday night : " This is just the start, fellas. We 're going to get better. " <p> How? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sale of the team plods through a process that might take until February or longer. <p> Hendry did n't offer a lot of answers Sunday night on what he thinks he 'll be allowed to do or even what he wants to do. The club 's organizational meetings, in which some of that will be hashed out, are almost three weeks away. But he agreed with DeRosa 's view of the core. <p> " I definitely like the nucleus, " Hendry said. " Just by how we played from June 1 on -- we were second in baseball behind the Yankees from June 1 -- showed enough talent to compete and showed the character of the guys we 've got. <p> " With Lou 's guidance, they certainly came out of a rough start and won the division. Not that that 's the end-all and what you strive for, but it was an accomplishment. " <p> Even if a big move is not on the Cubs ' winter horizon, plenty of changes could be coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff more than anywhere else. What will the rotation look like? Who 's the closer? <p> " We have a lot of good problems to worry about, even if they do n't make many moves, " DeRosa said. <p> 1. Who will buy the team, and when, and how much wheeling and dealing will Hendry be allowed to do one year after the biggest offseason spending spree in major-league history? <p> The " who " is n't nearly as relevant as the " when " in determining whether Hendry 's hands will be tied. Count on more restrictions than he has had in the past( see $300 million outlay last winter). On the other hand, he does n't have nearly as much on his to-do list this time around and might have enough financial latitude to do what he needs. <p> 2. Does closer Ryan Dempster get a shot at the starting rotation, and if so, does that mean setup man extraordinaire Carlos Marmol gets a shot to close? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday night he has yet to be informed of any such move and has n't asked, but he also said he 'd like a shot and is ready for the challenge. <p> Dempster, who was told to get ready for such a move in May, said again Sunday that he 'd love to get that opportunity next spring. <p> " Absolutely, " said Dempster, who pitched 200 innings as a starter three times before moving to the bullpen after Tommy John surgery at the end of 2004. " I enjoy closing.... I 'd love to start. I think I could do a good job of it. " <p> If he joins the mix for a starting spot, it gives the Cubs even more options in a rotation that already returns intact after going all season without missing a start for injury and ranking second in the National League in starters ' ERA( 4.19) to San Diego( 4.11). <p> Right-handers Kevin Hart and Sean Gallagher, who showed promise in cameos as rookies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> One intriguing possibility that a Dempster move could open is the freedom to shop Jason Marquis, in whom Piniella lost confidence down the stretch, chancing a three-man playoff rotation rather than include Marquis. <p> Dempster said he has n't had a conversation with team officials about the possibility since the move was called off three days after it was hatched in May. He said he plans to find out in the next two weeks or so which role he should start preparing for this winter. <p> 3. Hey, what about Wood and Prior? The annual Cubs question that finally was pushed into the margins with the overhaul that took place since last season might be answered for good this offseason. <p> Mark Prior, who made $3.575 million this year, is coming off shoulder surgery, unlikely to be ready for full participation in spring training and is eligible for arbitration again. Among other things, that means the Cubs are allowed to pay him no less than $2.86 million next year because major-league rules forbid cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that makes it especially unlikely that the repeatedly injured Prior will remain in the organization. <p> Kerry Wood, who signed a one-year, $1.75 million deal to stay with the club and attempt a comeback in the bullpen, eventually pulled it off and looked strong the final two months. The questions now are whether he wants to start again( he 'll have to do it elsewhere), how much the Cubs are willing to commit in years and dollars to keep him, how much he is willing to accept and, most intriguing, does he or anyone else envision him in a closer role? <p> 4. Soto rooter or catcher on the fly? Maybe the most impressive evolution of the Cubs ' season took place behind the plate. They opened with Michael Barrett, who became one of the team 's biggest liabilities until being traded in June ; wound up using six starting catchers ; and eventually looked within to find the solution in Geovany Soto, who all but earned next year 's starting job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5. What do you do with Alfonso Soriano? Move him out of the leadoff spot? Move him out of left field? <p> Forget it. At $136 million for eight years, he 's staying in left, and he 's all but assured of staying in the leadoff spot -- although it might be tempting to give that Ryan Theriot guy a look next spring... <p> DOLLARS AND SENSE <p> The Cubs enter the offseason with almost $96 million in guaranteed base salaries committed to 13 players for next season -- representing $21.7 million in combined raises for those players. Considering the uncertainty over team ownership and a 2007 payroll of about $100million, one of the biggest questions this winter will be how much room that payroll has to grow. <p> Pos. Player 2008 <p> RHP Carlos Zambrano $15 million <p> 3B Aramis Ramirez $14 million <p> 1B Derrek Lee $13 million <p> LF Alfonso Soriano $13 million <p> LHP Ted Lilly $7 million <p> RHP Jason Marquis $6.375 million <p> RHP Ryan Dempster $5.5 million <p> CF Jacque Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob Howry $4 million <p> LHP Scott Eyre $3.8 million* <p> C Henry Blanco $2.8 million <p> LHP Will Ohman $1.6 million <p> 13 players $95.825 million <p> * Player option expected to be exercised. <p> Free agents : RHP Kerry Wood, RHP Steve Trachsel, C Jason Kendall, OF Craig Monroe, OF Cliff Floyd, OF Daryle Ward( $1.2 million club option). <p> Eligible for arbitration : RHP Michael Wuertz, RHP Mark Prior.
