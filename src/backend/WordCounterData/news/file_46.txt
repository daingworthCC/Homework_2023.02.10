3006341 <p> LIFE is a serial adventure. It can not be packaged between covers. It requires patience : It proceeds at its own pace, can not be rushed to its denouement, and reveals its meaning only after years of themes and variations. Thoreau wrote that he went to Walden Pond because he wanted to " live deliberately, " as if everyone else 's life were somehow accidental ; yet accident is the antithesis of what most people live. Time passes, people make choices : The fruit of their labor is the opening of another chapter of life. <p> The way we live contrasts oddly with the way we commonly read. We often accept the premise that art should imitate life, but our art - or at least our literature - does not imitate life in at least one very specific way. Literature comes into our hands fully formed. It comes as a book, an object, with a beginning and an end, a coherent spectacle that allows us to believe we can hold an entire life, a family saga, or a history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening, after reading a few dozen pages of Gibbon 's " Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire " or Proust 's " Remembrance of Things Past, " with perhaps a thousand or five hundred pages to go, a reader can still take a certain pleasure in knowing that the end is quite literally in sight. The time it takes to read the rest is a purely private matter, strictly up to the reader. If he lacks patience, he can skim, read a bit here and there, move to the last pages in a matter of hours. He has the pleasure of knowing that the book is his : In owning it, he controls it, and nothing beyond the sphere of his private life affects his relationship with it. <p> Life is never this way - never entirely private, never something we own, never simply a matter of our personal will or control. How strange that we should seek this from our literature! And yet there is one form of literature which evades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our lives. This is the serialized work of fiction or nonfiction, which first appears, not in book form, but in sequential issues of a magazine or newspaper. <p> Accustomed to relatively cheap paperbacks on almost every subject, we tend to think of serialized magazine publication as quaint : It almost never occurs in contemporary America. True, magazines like the Atlantic or Harper 's publish excerpts from forthcoming books - the Atlantic, for example, recently excerpted a chapter from Paul Fussell 's " Wartime, " and other issues have contained selections from other serious works of fiction or nonfiction. But none of these is spread over several issues : Each is a one-shot deal. The only consistent exception is the New Yorker, which has run such books as Jamaica Kincaid 's " Annie John " and Jonathan Schell 's " The Fate of The Earth " over several issues. <p> The 19th century had a different approach to all this. Magazines and newspapers reigned in a way that seems hardly imaginable today. " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, manager of the Columbian Magazine, in 1843. " They are the field, chiefly, in which literary reputation is won. " Rather than slicing up the market into relatively tiny special-interest groups - agriculturalists, industrialists, hobbyists, sailors, and so on - the publishers produced as many general-interest magazines and newspapers as they could : They competed with each other for provocative essays and fiction. The 19th-century lineup included not only the Atlantic and Harper 's Weekly, but also Putnam 's, Lippincott 's, the Nation, the North American Review, the Galaxy, the Independent, Scribner 's Monthly, and a host of others. And one of the mainstays of all these publications was the serialized story or novel. <p> Harriet Beecher Stowe 's " Uncle Tom 's Cabin " appeared in serialized form in Putnam 's ; Henry James 's first novel, " Watch and Ward, " was serialized in the Atlantic Monthly in 1871. Two installments of Edgar Allan Poe 's " The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and Mark Twain 's " Innocents Abroad " first appeared in 1867 in the columns of the San Francisco newspaper Alta Californian. Surrounding the work of these authors were countless other stories and novels, potboilers and period pieces, from authors who worked to fill the magazines ' voracious appetite for serials. <p> The most celebrated serial author was not American, of course : Charles Dickens even began his own magazine, Household Words( the name was changed to All the Year Round), to publish his and other authors ' serialized novels. Most of Dickens ' greatest works, including " David Copperfield, " " Great Expectations, " " Bleak House, " and " Hard Times, " appeared in sequential issues of the magazines. In fact, Dickens began to write " Great Expectations " specifically to rescue his magazine from the slumping sales caused by Charles Lever 's dull serialized novel, " A Day 's Ride, a Life 's Romance. " Chapters of " Great Expectations " supplanted Lever 's book ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted audiences is not hard to imagine. Like life, serialized literature was more than a private matter. The next episode was cause for speculation, discussion, anticipation : It was a public event. The chronology of publication required patience, inviting readers to reflect on what they had read, on its relation to what had gone before, and on its promise for what was still to come. Readers could not own the story in the way they could own a book, because the story as a whole did not exist until the last episode ; thus they concentrated, not on the commodity of books, but on the possibilities of character and plot and theme. In this somewhat unexpected way, the serialized novel bound up literature in the very act and motion of living, offering readers a level of engagement that a single book, read once and quickly, did not necessarily provide. <p> Yet there were problems. As magazines increasingly anticipated the taste and social class of their audience, stories became formulaic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Visiting Nathaniel Hawthorne in 1851, after the disastrous publication of " Moby Dick, " Melville lamented the state of writing - particularly magazine writing - in America. Americans, he said, were too ready to be coddled and stroked in their reading, too unwilling to take risks. Desperate to make a living, Melville tried with decreasing success to fit his stories into the image-conscious constraints of the popular magazines. His own decline vividly illustrated the danger of the publishers ' tendency to follow an audience rather than lead it. <p> While serialized novels were largely a 19th-century phenomenon, the problems of triviality and popularity were clearly not. They recur today, in magazines and books, where frequently the latest fad is the biggest bestseller, and the fine art of distraction supercedes all other arts. What would happen, in these circumstances, if the serialized novel or story were to make a new debut? What if it made a promise to imitate life not only in its words but in its intervals? What if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it became a communal event? I suspect publishers of magazines and newspapers would laugh it off as a gimmick. Yet a small voice in me says it might succeed. What could make it work is a simple, tripartite courage : a writer writing a little closer to life, a publisher willing to take the risk, and a group of readers who know that reading, like life, is a matter of episodes whose ends and answers are never final. Today the Home Forum introduces something new to our pages : A serial story, written by the Monitor 's feature editor, David Holmstrom. It recalls the days when newspapers and journals serialized an entire book or article. ' The Last Horse ' concludes tomorrow.
