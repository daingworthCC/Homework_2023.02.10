3051741 <p> President Bush has gone from threatening Democratic lawmakers that they 'll suffer politically for not supporting his Social Security overhaul to cajoling Republican lawmakers with promises of campaign help if they do. <p> Neither tactic is working. Bush 's poll numbers continue to sink, driven in part by his plan to add private accounts and reduce benefits in the giant retirement program. <p> Democrats appear on the verge of scoring a huge political victory over Bush by defeating what had been the centerpiece domestic policy of his second term. <p> Bush 's hopes of salvaging even small private accounts now rest entirely on the two Republican leaders of the committees in charge of Social Security : former college professor Rep. Bill Thomas of Bakersfield, the shrewd and unpredictable chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee who is a master of the tax code and entitlement programs, and blunt-spoken Iowa farmer Sen. Charles Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. <p> Both men face unbroken Democratic opposition and disagreement and resistance within their own party. <p> Nonetheless, the White House is relying on Thomas to craft a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican leaders can then push through the House, where they control the agenda. <p> Grassley faces the filibuster rules of the Senate, where Republicans hold 55 votes, but need 60 votes to overcome the blocking maneuver by Democrats. <p> As bad as the polls look, Bush shows no sign of backing off. <p> " I spoke with several people at the White House this morning, and I just got off the phone with an aide to a senior member of the House leadership, all of whom assure me that the House is moving forward, " Michael Tanner, a leading private-account advocate at the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank, said late last week. <p> " As far as the White House goes, the White House is not seeking an exit strategy. The president still plans to be out there at least once a week, forever if necessary, to talk about this, " Tanner said. " They are not pulling back any of their intentions at all. " <p> White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush has scheduled another conversation on Social Security for Thursday. <p> Thomas has promised a sweeping retirement security package, including everything from measures to buttress pensions to tax breaks for savings. <p> Republican strategists hope to meld the Thomas package with a Senate bill, which might not even have private accounts. The final product would shore up Social Security 's finances at least somewhat and contain the small beginnings of private accounts -- far short of Bush 's plan but enough for the president to declare victory. <p> " I think the real concern is that as crafty as Thomas is, he 'll write a 500-page bill, and privatization will be included in a footnote, " said Brad Woodhouse, spokesman for Americans United to Protect Social Security, an umbrella group leading the national campaign to defeat Bush 's plan. <p> Thomas has used this tactic before. <p> Rep. Jim Cooper, a conservative Tennessee Democrat, recalled that last year Thomas rescued a corporate tax bill that had languished for years. It was initially supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $150 billion measure with provisions that swept in dozens of Democrats -- including a tobacco farmer bailout, a tax holiday for multinational corporations, income-tax deductibility for state sales taxes and even a provision aiding domestic makers of fishing tackle boxes. <p> " That was a $10 billion problem, and he asked us to vote for a $150 billion bill, " Cooper recalled. " You know, when I tell folks that back home, they get sick. " <p> But Cooper voted for the bill. " I did, " he said, " because it had tax relief for Tennessee in it. " <p> Cooper, a deficit hawk, called last year 's tax bill classic legislative log rolling. He strongly opposes private accounts and believes a bipartisan commission is the only way to resolve the issue. <p> Thomas is plowing ahead with Social Security hearings, at the rate of two a week. Rep. Jim McCrery, R-La., who chairs the Ways and Means subcommittee on Social Security, insisted last week that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped to focus on shoring up Social Security 's solvency -- the system is projected to start running in the red in 2017 -- as a way to skirt opposition to private accounts. The only area where the White House has scored points in public opinion polls is calling attention to the program 's looming financial shortfalls as the Baby Boom generation begins to retire. <p> But Grassley has been stalemated by one of his own Republican colleagues, Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine. <p> Snowe opposes private accounts and efforts to reduce benefits for all but the poorest seniors -- the progressive indexing that Bush reluctantly embraced two months ago at considerable political cost. <p> Snowe is running for re-election in 2006 in a state that voted Democratic in the last presidential election and has a large proportion of elderly voters. <p> More than a dozen meetings with Republican senators on the Finance Committee have failed to produce an agreement, and some have said publicly they doubt a Social Security bill can be enacted. <p> The problem with a solvency-only bill is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require pain for the middle class. The menu is limited : raising the retirement age or indexing it to gains in life expectancy, and reducing benefits. <p> The one option favored by Democrats, to lift the $90,000 threshold on income subject to Social Security taxes, is anathema to Republicans because it would amount to sharp tax increases on incomes above that threshold and essentially roll back Bush 's signature income-tax rate cuts. <p> Moreover, many conservative Republicans say they will not support a Social Security bill that lacks private accounts, arguing that the purpose of taking on the battle would be lost. <p> Conservatives are coalescing around the idea of using just the Social Security surplus to fund private accounts -- creating what they call the " ultimate lockbox. " <p> Since 1983, the program has collected more in payroll taxes than it pays in benefits, and the government has been spending the money on operations. <p> This is the one area of Social Security that angers a wide swath of voters in both parties. Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Social Security lockbox a major campaign theme. <p> The Social Security surplus is expected to total roughly $2 trillion over the next decade. <p> Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., plans to introduce a bill to use the surplus to fund individual accounts, with investments limited only to Treasury bonds. The idea was first proposed in April by Alex Pollack, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, who argued that it " will deliver all of the benefits of personal accounts with none of the costs or risks cited by opponents. " <p> The big political problem is that using the surplus for Social Security accounts would increase the deficit in the rest of the budget by about $160 billion this year. <p> Woodhouse, of Americans United to Protect Social Security, said his group is warning opponents not to become complacent just because Bush is foundering. <p> " The people who want to privatize Social Security control the levers of power in this town, " Woodhouse said.
