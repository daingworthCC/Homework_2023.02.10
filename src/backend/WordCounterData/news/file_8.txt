3001341 <p> The inmates on Rikers Island readied for battle last November by scouring for weapons : plexiglass broken from light fixtures, razor blades attached to toothbrushes, metal wrenched from radiators. Thousands refused meals to protest cuts in services. Correction officers went on high alert. The nation 's largest jail complex braced for a riot. <p> But the explosion of New York City 's nearly 20,000 inmates never happened. The coalition of inmates weakened. The tension dissipated, like a fog lifting. This year, slashings and stabbings by inmates have declined sharply as jail officials herald an era of relative peace and control. <p> Just as last fall 's prediction of an uprising was overstated, however, this season 's calm masks the daily drumbeat of violence on Rikers. The same volatile ingredients that nearly boiled over six months ago still exist. The number of inmates is rising, the number of officers is declining, and inmate services, including counseling and classes, have been sharply cut. The Giuliani administration 's anti-crime drive and its push for austerity are colliding at the jails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " said Sal F. Albanese, a member of the City Council 's Public Safety Committee. " I 'm sure the hierarchy of the department gets up every morning and prays that there 's no problems. " <p> The mundane daily catalogue of violent incidents is jarring : slicing fights between inmates who store razor blades in their mouths ; vicious, seemingly unprovoked attacks on correction officers by inmates ; officers subduing inmates with their fists. <p> It is a gauge of the gulf between jail and the free world that such violence persists in an atmosphere touted by officials, and some inmates, as dramatically improved. <p> " Before you could n't live in jail, " said Efaim Torres, a prisoner in a crowded dormitory of metal beds and cold-eyed inmates. " Now you can go to sleep and not worry. " <p> But even with this year 's drop in slashings and stabbings -- 251 for the first quarter compared with 324 for the last three months of 1994 -- the level of violence is considerably higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the entire year. <p> This year 's trend, said Eric M. Taylor, the jails ' top officer, is the result of clamping down hard on the inmates -- more frequent weapons searches, computer analyses for pinpointing violence-prone areas, and added restraints on the most dangerous. <p> Yet the long-term trend continues. The inmates are more violent and better armed, reflecting the tenor of the street. The jails are increasingly strapped for resources, reflecting the state of the city government. Logging the Violence Single-Edge Razor : Weapon of Choice <p> The internal daily logs of the city 's jails read like a script of violence that ebbs and flows between seasons and sometimes between days. <p> Two weeks ago, in a seemingly typical incident, a correction officer at the James A. Thomas Center was punched by an inmate, " knocked to the floor and rendered unconscious, " according to an internal report. When officers tried to strip-search the inmate he attacked again. " Officers exchanged punches with the inmate, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled a razor from his pants pocket. " <p> " Inmate refused to comply with the orders to release the weapon, " the report said, " so the captain kicked at the inmate 's hand until the inmate released the razor blade. " <p> The previous day, three inmates at the Thomas jail had been stabbed by four fellow inmates. <p> " We 're just a reflection of the street, " said Ralph McGrane, an assistant chief of the Department of Correction. " People get into fights over basketball and softball games on the street. It 's no different here. " <p> In that same jail, officers conducted a search on Jan. 20 and within three and a half hours found 59 razors and 11 homemade knives. Two months later, an inmate directed officers to a telephone where they unscrewed the mouthpiece and found a stash of 40 razors. During February and March, officers recovered 1,436 weapons from all of the city 's jails. <p> " The single-edged razor, that 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security officer on Rikers Island. " It 'll cut you open like a hot knife going through butter. These guys have more weapons than they do on the street. " <p> To catch smuggled weapons, visitors are searched before entering the jails and employees pass through metal detectors, or magnometers. But in October, when Correction Department investigators conducted a surprise check of the staff entrances at nine Rikers jails, they found the magnometers were not on at three of the jails, according to a report on the examination. At six of the jails, investigators noted, the staff members were not accustomed to regular searches. Officers have since been retrained in security procedures, an official said. <p> Only the inmates have the weapons in the jails, but the aggression on Rikers goes both ways, and beyond. <p> The department is investigating a March 25 incident in which a Rikers pharmacy assistant, Vincent James, was apparently mistaken for an inmate on the grounds of the island as he arrived for work. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. In a statement released by Local 1199 of the National Health and Human Services Employees Union, Mr. James said the captain " took her nightstick from her belt and struck me three times perpendicularly directly into my abdomen. " <p> Even after Mr. James identified himself, the statement said, one officer " put a thick glove on his right hand and forcibly held my face with his gloved hand. He pressed my face in a downward position. I felt as though my head was about to be pushed through my chest cavity. " Mr. James was eventually released but told by the officers to remain silent about the incident, the statement said. <p> The logs report daily conflicts between inmates and officers. Often officers respond by punching inmates. <p> On April 4, an inmate assaulted a correction officer and the officer " responded with several punches to the face and body. " <p> On April 5, two inmates " refused to cease fighting " and when officers " employed body holds, the noted inmates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> On April 8, when an officer told an inmate to hang up a telephone " the inmate refused and pushed the officer in the chest area. " <p> " The officer responded with one punch to the facial area " and then put the inmate in a cell with the help of other officers. <p> Jonathan Chasan, a Legal Aid Society lawyer, who has brought several successful lawsuits charging brutality by officers at Rikers, said officers are supposed to use the least injurious form of restraint necessary, but the guideline is often ignored. He said the department lacks adequate internal monitors on staff actions. A 6th Borough A Neighborhood Of Jails <p> Rikers Island is like the city 's sixth borough, an island between the Bronx and Queens, populated by the accused and the convicted. <p> The majority are detainees, legally innocent and awaiting trial, some locked up for lack of a few hundred dollars in bail money. There are parole violators serving short sentences, and others are recently convicted, awaiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About 15,000 city inmates are at Rikers, with an additional 400 to 500 at borough detention centers. The island is a haphazard collection of 10 jails, each its own neighborhood. <p> The Rose M. Singer Center, the women 's jail, for example, is such a cheery version of incarceration that one wonders if the metal mesh on the windows is meant to keep people in or out. Women march to lunch singing about bettering their lives. Searches for contraband turn up " basically excessive clothing, " said the warden, Jannie Poullard. <p> More places are like the James A. Thomas Center, which looks every inch a jail. Its long, narrow cell blocks with 75 cells apiece stacked three tiers high reverberate with the dull murmurs of idle inmates and the sharp clang of metal gates. On a crisp spring day, the air inside stings from a morning shower of disinfectant. <p> The inmate traffic across the sloping bridge from Queens to Rikers Island is reaching record proportions -- up 20,000, to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, counselors and teachers on the island grows thinner. <p> With the crush of prisoners and cuts in resources, the Giuliani administration is trying to rally its corps of correction officers. <p> On a recent tour of the jails, arranged for The New York Times after six months of requests, signs of morale boosters were evident. They range from the substantive -- a new emphasis on cleanliness -- to the symbolic -- Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani now visits injured officers in the hospital -- to the simplistic -- the staff entrance of the Otis Bantum Correctional Center displays the " 11 Commandments for an Enthusiastic Team. " <p> Commandment 5 : " Speak positively about each other and about your organization at every opportunity. " Commandment 11 : " Have fun. " Budget Squeeze Economy Moves Anger Inmates <p> Just as violence is an immediate threat to inmates and staff, the continual budget squeeze threatens the equilibrium of the jails. <p> Last fall 's food strikes were prompted by reports of planned reductions in classes, counseling service and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " time to 9 P.M. from 11 P.M., all changes driven by the city 's budget crisis. Only the change in the lock-in time, a volatile issue among inmates, was dropped. <p> For next year, the mayor 's budget proposal calls for a $56 million decrease in the department 's current $761 million budget and cuts of 749 officers and 228 civilian employees. <p> No correction officers have been hired since 1991, and the number has fallen by more than 1,000 in the last two years, to 9,529. Meanwhile, annual admission to city jails is rising, 18 percent in the last year. <p> With the officer-to-inmate ratio diminished, said Stan Israel, the president of the Correction Officers Benevolent Association, inmates, and particularly leaders of jailhouse gangs, have become more powerful. " The price of peace is to let the gangs flourish, and I think one day they are going to pay the price, " Mr. Israel said. <p> The strain is obvious. The city is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The overtime budget last year was $88 million and this year is $89 million, with a planned decline to $72 million next year. <p> " These are guys who are doing a thankless job, " said William Booth, the chairman of the Board of Correction, which oversees the department. " When they have to work double and triple shifts their efficiency goes down. They ca n't be as alert or effective. " <p> Inmate services have been cut sharply. About 900 drug treatment beds were eliminated by the Giuliani administration in the last year, although some are now being restored, and even larger jails, with more than 1,000 inmates, have just one inmate counselor each. <p> At the Anna M. Kross jail, inmates in a crowded dormitory said that other than one hour of outdoor recreation early each morning, they are locked in the dorm and the adjacent television room all day, sleeping, listening to cassette players, talking. They said they even eat meals on their beds. <p> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee, in jail on weapons charges, lives with a group of inmates on a clean, sunny cell block that has regular meetings to discuss substance abuse and self-esteem problems. The inmates set rules for the living area and even vote before switching the television channel. While his cell block is peaceful and productive, he knows much of the jail is not and that idleness can breed unrest. <p> " We understand that a lot of the cuts are for budget reasons, " Mr. Lee said, " but you ca n't just lock up a lot of people and not give them anything to do. " More With Less Seeking Ways To Cut Expenses <p> The correction problem has fallen to Michael P. Jacobson, who was appointed acting commissioner in January, after Anthony J. Schembri resigned during an inquiry into whether he met the city 's residency requirement. <p> It 's among the most difficult budgeting tasks in city government. The department has little say over the size of its population. The Police Department controls the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are rising. The courts and district attorneys control the flow out of the jails by disposing of cases. <p> But to meet its tight budget for next year, the department is counting on the city to cut the average time in jail for accused criminals by 6 days, to 40 days. <p> Speeding up the city 's criminal case system has long been a concern of various agencies, and there has been some success at doing so in recent years. But without significant success soon to reduce the jails ' average daily population, the department could face even deeper cuts in staff. Mr. Jacobson fears that could threaten security. <p> " I do n't think we can afford to lose much more uniform staff with the current population, " said Mr. Jacobson, who is also the probation commissioner and a former Dinkins administration budget official. <p> The department is reviewing all of its operations, searching for ways to save money. Paradoxically, that may mean restoring some inmate services, like drug treatment, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reducing overtime costs, Mr. Jacobson said. <p> He said the department will use 600 new jail beds, due to open in the summer, as drug treatment centers, replacing two-thirds of the treatment beds cut over the last year. Mr. Jacobson said running the new jail units as drug treatment centers requires fewer officers, and will save money. <p> Some changes save money and reduce violence. For example, a new telephone system ends inmate calls after six minutes, cutting down on fights over phones and saving a projected $2 million in telephone bills. <p> In making some changes, the department is likely to face a fight from inmate advocates. Officials want relief from court orders and consent decrees that govern all aspects of jail life, from the schedule for window washing to the time inmates are locked in for the night. <p> " My concern is they might attempt to undo 15 or 20 years of work aimed at insuring the humane treatment of inmates in city jails, " said John Boston, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " People who are incarcerated should be treated humanely. If the city says it does n't have enough money to treat them humanely, they should have less people in jail. " <p> One challenge is expected to come when the department seeks to increase jail space by housing sentenced inmates in a part of an old jail that a judge has already found unfit for detainees awaiting trial. <p> Another court ruling likely to be challenged requires a full medical exam, including chest X-rays, on any new inmate, even if the inmate is re-entering jail after having left a few days before. <p> But rules more basic to the operation of the jails are to be reviewed, including staffing levels and other security matters. <p> Mr. Jacobson said the city is not trying to evade constitutional responsibilities, but it simply wants to operate the jails within its means. <p> " We 're not saying that 's it, we 're just going to feed them corn dogs, " Mr. Jacobson said. <p> Yet others, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear that a new round of cuts and adjustments could revive unrest, threatening what he called Rikers Island 's " relative quiet. " <p> " I hope it continues, " Mr. Booth said, " but I do n't think it will.
