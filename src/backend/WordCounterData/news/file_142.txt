3029541 <p> Eastern Conference <p> Elbow room : Atlanta C Dikembe Mutombo and his razor-sharp elbows had quite a weekend. He broke the noses of Cavs F-C Vitaly Potapenko and Nets F Jayson Williams on back-to-back nights. Potapenko 's nose bled profusely after catching an elbow Friday in the third quarter of the season opener in Atlanta. "( Cavs trainer) Gary Briggs put it back in place and moved it over, " Cavs coach Mike Fratello said. " He 's a tough kid. It 's not a big deal to him. " Briggs pulled a clear-plastic mask out of his bag of goodies and Potapenko came back to the game in the fourth quarter. " It was in the heat of the battle, " Potapenko said. " It 's been a bad start for me. I got cut( under the eye in the second preseason game, which needed six stitches). It 's just part of the job. " Williams will not require a mask for the broken nose he suffered Saturday in Atlanta. Williams said he would not retaliate in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NBA my money? I 'm trying to put another pool in, " he said. But when asked what if Mutombo hit him again, he said, " I can always go to the beach. " <p> Young blood : Indiana rookie F Al Harrington is the fifth player in the last four years to be drafted in the first round out of high school. But after three games, the personable yet high-strung 18-year-old from Elizabeth, N.J, does n't feel like a teen-ager on a team whose average age is 32. " I 've been playing with these guys, and I feel like I belong now, " Harrington said. " I do n't feel like I 'm 18 anymore. We just all have fun together. They do n't treat me like I 'm a little baby or anything like that. " C-F Sam Perkins, who at 38 is more than twice Harrington 's age, marvels at the youth 's skills but cautions that the road ahead still is treacherous. " First of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's in store for him, " Perkins said. " Al has a lot to learn. He has a lot of talent, and he could be one of the premier stars in this league after three years. " <p> Magic man : Philadelphia 76ers President Pat Croce has gone from a physical trainer for the NHL 's Philadelphia Flyers to a successful head of a physical rehabilitation company to his current challenge of trying to lead the Sixers to an NBA title. If he reaches that goal, Croce has his next occupation lined up. " After( a title), I do n't think I would stay. I 'm goal-oriented, " said Croce, who convinced the Sixers ' owners, Comcast Corp., to spend $ 160 million this month to lock up G Allen Iverson, F Theo Ratliff and C Matt Geiger to long-term deals. " But I want to be a professional magician. In fact, I told( coach) Larry( Brown) the other day that once we have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magician. " Brown 's response to the man who got a corporation to fork over the big dollars for the three contracts? " He said, ' You already are a magician. ' " <p> Missing muscle : The early returns are pretty decisive as to who benefited the most when New York traded F Charles Oakley to the Raptors for F-C Marcus Camby last June. Oakley refuses to gloat, but the ex-Knick has seen New York struggle without his intimidating presence. " Personally, the way I see it,( Knicks general manager) Ernie Grunfeld and( President) David Checketts made the trade, " Oakley said. " I 'll let them lose their sleep at night. I get my sleep. " Oakley figures friend and former teammate C Patrick Ewing, 36, wo n't be able to handle the rebounding load for the Knicks, an area Oakley relished during his 10-year tenure in New York. " When you 're an elite team, you need some guys who can do the dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " Oakley said. " The Knicks thought I could n't play anymore. " <p> Western Conference <p> Wurst performance : Dallas rookie F Dirk Nowitzki averaged 28.3 points and 9.9 rebounds last year while playing for Wurzburg, Germany. After his first NBA game, it was obvious he had left his game in Germany. " There 's not much to say other than I have to play much more aggressive on both ends and get more rebounds, " Nowitzki said of his poor effort against Seattle. " For a 6-11 guy to get no rebounds in 16 minutes is unbelievable. " Nowitzki 's punishment for his lackluster showing in the 92-86 overtime loss to Seattle? " The coaches made me watch 45 minutes of tape of the game in Seattle so I could see what I did wrong, " he said. " They told me to play much more aggressive on both ends and to just play my game. I was so disappointed after the Seattle game because I know I can do better. " Nowitzki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his next two games. <p> Rookie razzing : Though he hit a game-winning shot against Golden State and is averaging 13 points, Houston rookie G Cuttino Mobley still gets the rookie treatment from Charles Barkley. Mobley dressed casually after the Denver game Monday in a striped pullover, jeans and tennis shoes. " What 'd I tell you about dressing like that? " Barkley bellowed. " You 're in the pros now. This is not Rhode Island. The girls here have all their teeth. " Barkley said it did n't matter that Mobley hit the big shot against the Warriors. " He was open, he was supposed to hit it, " Barkley said. <p> Growing up : The physical development of Minnesota G Stephon Marbury is obvious in the biceps rippling beneath his tattoos. But his development as a leader, and a more mature practice player, has been a favorite topic of coaches and teammates. So far, coach Flip Saunders has given the keys to the Wolves ' offense to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past. It 's a reflection of his faith in Marbury 's decision-making and an effort to make Marbury enjoy his stay in Minnesota up to and beyond free agency this summer. " I used to call everything, pretty much, " Saunders said. " But he 's getting to the point where he knows what I 'm going to call. He anticipates it. " <p> Role model : Vancouver rookie G Felipe Lopez is the first player from the Dominican Republic to be drafted by an NBA team, and he takes his responsibility as a role model seriously. " It means a lot, " said Lopez, drafted No. 24 overall by San Antonio last June before being traded to Vancouver. " Because being a youngster and being able to watch the Celtics playing the Lakers in those ' 80s series, I could have never imagined myself being there. But to this moment now, I can see myself playing against these guys and probably making all the youngsters back in the Dominican Republic, or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too. " Lopez, whose family moved to New York when he was a teen-ager, does summer basketball clinics in his homeland and spent part of the NBA lockout helping to muster aid for victims of Hurricane Georges. In his first two NBA games, he has averaged five points and 14.5 minutes off the bench.
