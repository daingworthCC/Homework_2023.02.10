3057641 <p> At Wheatley High School, time stands still. A deep pride that took root when the school opened 78 years ago has not waned. <p> It 's apparent in the way fans show up in droves at Wheatley basketball games. It 's visible on faces young and old. It 's heard in their whoops and hollers. The royal purple shirts and Wildcat emblems have spanned generations. <p> Now, those fans have a new team to carry the tradition. Wheatley will play San Antonio Houston at 8:30 tonight in Austin, and a victory would put the Wildcats in Saturday afternoon 's Class 4A boys championship game. A victory Saturday would bring a sixth University Interscholastic League basketball title for the school. <p> More impressive than that, however, are the 12 state basketball championships the school earned from 1942 to 1966. <p> But none of those titles appears in UIL records. That 's because all 12 came in the Prairie View Interscholastic League - the former governing body of black public schools in Texas. <p> Wheatley 's titles went virtually unnoticed. Because major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the days of segregation, Wheatley 's accomplishments were all but forgotten once HISD schools were integrated in 1968 and the Wildcats joined the UIL. <p> " I think it was hard for the black schools to work like they did and not get recognized, " said Charles Herbert, a former Wheatley principal who also worked with the basketball programs and graduated from the school. " It 's not that they did n't want to be included with the white schools and show what they could do against any kind of athletes. They just could n't. " <p> Coach searched archives <p> The PVIL records those coaches and athletes set all but disappeared in the shadows of a state looking to overcome the growing pains of integration. That was until former Fort Worth Terrell coach Walter Day spent seven years traveling the state and compiling the Prairie View records. <p> After digging through what little archives newspapers had on the black teams, Day published a series of five books, Remembering the Past With Pride, in 1993. With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> And with an organized recount of the records in hand, the still-active PVIL executive board - a group made up of former coaches and players for the league that officially folded in 1970 - is working with the UIL to have its records included. <p> The lost years are 1940 to 1970. <p> " Both sides are working to get all the records validated, " UIL athletic director Charles Breithaupt said. " We want them to be recognized, and it 's kind of an ongoing process to get everything accurately recorded. The records would be included alongside the UIL records for the years that the leagues competed separately, and this is a project we feel strong about and are continuing to work on with the Prairie View executives. " <p> The efforts the UIL and PVIL board have made in preserving the records set at black schools are encouraging to those who participated in the Prairie View league. Because they can remember a time when they were told the records did n't matter, formal recognition helps - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " When you have the opportunity to let someone know that what you did is viewed as important, then it 's good to take it, " Day said. " And the UIL has been a part of that. We 've worked hard to get things organized. The next steps are falling into place. " <p> That 's so people such as John Codwell Jr. can forever be honored for their accomplishments. A senior on Wheatley 's 1950 PVIL state championship squad, Codwell knew success from an early age. He grew up under the careful eye of his father, John Codwell, who was a principal at Wheatley and the team 's first basketball coach. His dad made sure he had every opportunity available to him while living in the Houston area. <p> Remembered his roots <p> While he played for Wheatley, Codwell revered the Wildcats ' tradition and was thrilled by the home crowds. But it was n't until he enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1951 and joined Grand Rapids, Mich. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Wolverines ' basketball program that Codwell realized just how secure his Wheatley upbringing made him feel. <p> " I did n't know the feeling of not being accepted when I was in high school. We grew up segregated, so we knew we were n't treated equal, " Codwell said. " But I was never in the midst of being different or an outsider or however you look at it. <p> " So that background( at Wheatley) and upbringing was something I held on to. " <p> It 's clear Wheatley players and supporters have always held their heads high and never stopped believing that the Wildcats had something special. Something that would one day make everyone - regardless of race or background - take notice. <p> That day came when HISD integrated its schools. With integration came the beginning of the end for the PVIL as most black schools joined the UIL. In its first year of UIL competition in 1968, Wheatley won the Class 5A state basketball title. <p> The Wildcats repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1973 and set the UIL Class 5A record for the most championships when they claimed a fifth crown in 1978. <p> " It was from that first year that all schools took the black schools seriously, " Herbert said. " They paid attention. I know many of the white schools never doubted that we had great athletes. But they always said they could outcoach a black coach. But from 1968 on, that was n't a problem. " <p> The accomplishments of coaches such as Codwell Sr., who led Wheatley to its first title in 1942, and Collin Briggs, who coached the Wildcats to 11 more PVIL titles, might not have been taken seriously by some, but the men are legends in the halls of Wheatley. <p> The Wildcats have never lost sight of their decorated history. And Wheatley always believed it could find the same success in the UIL as in the PVIL. <p> Jackie Carr is one of the most decorated coaches in high school basketball after leading Wheatley to its five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, first as an assistant under Briggs, to 1985 before retiring. He came out of retirement in 1993 and coached for 10 more years, taking the team back to the state tournament in 1997. <p> " What I can say is that coaching in an environment like Wheatley is enjoyable, " Carr said. " The tradition is rich. And the kids know that. It 's the overall tradition that keeps the team winning. " <p> It 's that tradition that has Wheatley back in the state tournament looking for state title No. 18. With a new head coach, Chester Smith, and a group of quick, talented players, the Wildcats play their first state semifinal game since 1997 tonight. With them go a powerful sixth man - the heroes of the past, coupled with community support that has never wavered. <p> " We 've had those 17 titles and the accomplishments of the past pounded in our heads this year, " senior guard Mitchell Fields said. " We want to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's remembered like the past ones. We owe that to everyone who has always believed in us.
