3046641 <p> We met Roger the Spy in 1989, a few weeks before the collapse of the Soviet bloc, on the Orient Express. <p> This was not the fabled Simplon Orient Express of Agatha Christie fame, just the routinely shabby rail line that links Western Europe to the East, changing little beyond conductors ' uniforms and preferred currency as it clicks across the landscape. Nor was Roger himself an obvious candidate for intrigue. Middle-aged, looking a bit harassed and confused, he joined the train one golden midafternoon at the Westbahnhof in Vienna. <p> It was n't shaping up to be a good compartment. Fast on Roger 's heels came two 50-ish schoolteacher sisters from Connecticut ; the sixth seat remained empty. Roger himself, who looked like 10,000 rumpled polyglot businessmen my husband and I had seen in the last few months, was saying little in an unidentifiable accent. We could n't place him ; we did n't recognize the passport. All in all, not the companions of choice for a first foray into communism. <p> For we were going to Budapest. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same unstellar reasons -- some time to kill, some faint curiosity. Scarcely two weeks before, Hungary had opened its border with Austria, allowing thousands of East German " tourists " to flee to the West ; the crumbling of the Soviet bloc had begun. If it were going to disappear or explode, we figured, we might as well go see it first. <p> So here we were, swaying through a flattening and darkening countryside with Roger and the schoolteachers, into the great plain of Central Europe. <p> At the border, when the train stopped to change crew and guards, a large and emphatic Hungarian woman, laden with bags and bundles, clambered into the compartment. She waved her papers at us and broke into immediate voluble complaints -- about the Soviets, as near as we could tell, and having to carry an internal passport. She brushed aside English, which we 'd been speaking, as well as French and German ; the monologue went on in uninterrupted Hungarian, ceasing only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a cursory glance at passports and visas, a look at tickets, a second passport check( this time, long comparisons of passengers and passport photos, with running commentary), an investigation into baggage and currency. <p> As we drew closer to Budapest, the land flattened still further and the sky grew dark ; it was clear we were already running late. Periodically, in the deeper darkness of forests, the train slowed and stopped and ground into silence ; the lights went out. Now and then, Roger lit a match to check the time. We talked quietly or not at all, except for the Hungarian woman ; she grew louder still, waving her papers and shouting at the other Hungarians who had crowded into the corridor at the border. Their untranslated anger, feeding so purposefully on itself, seemed real, a faint danger. Even complaining about the lateness seemed injudicious ; at some point, we had all become wary. And later, when it appeared we might finally be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @!, we feared even to disagree. If we ever got there, we muttered to ourselves, we 'd skip the subway and stick to taxis. <p> Roger said nothing at all. <p> But finding taxis was n't easy, at least at first. After Vienna, Keleti station was a shock -- poorly lit and dirty, with vaguely threatening knots of Gypsy kids breaking up the emptiness and Red Army troops lounging against the walls. Out front, a few dim cabs hurtled by and the street lights were so faint you could n't see across the avenue : a city dying ominously at 9:30 on a Friday night. Finally, around the corner, we stumbled onto a small cab queue. And Roger. <p> Roger, looking more harassed than ever, had -- like us -- failed to change any money into forints. But he had suddenly become talkative. Would cabs take francs, or dollars? Dollars, certainly, we thought, and probably not very many, either. Roger dithered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came. Such a tourist, our Roger, wherever he came from. Why travel if it caused such anxiety? <p> Roger had not yet become Roger the Spy. <p> Finally, $ 2 and one grateful cab driver later, we reached our hotel. We had n't planned to stay in anything like a Hyatt -- Budapest has plenty of elegant old hotels -- but we 'd made the reservations in Madrid, where the Hungarian tourist office had specialized in saying nem : booked, a busy time, all booked. OK, fine, Hyatt, we 'd agreed ; and none had ever looked better. <p> But who were these people? Cuban gynecologists on convention? Polish engineers? Soviet black-marketeers? The Hyatt was a swirl of light and bustle, an island of noisy unreal prosperity where a bowl of soup cost a week 's wages, a plate of goulash a month 's pension. <p> Numbed by the contrast, we ate well, and went to bed. <p> English-language guidebooks to Central Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to find just one, published long ago, thrown away the sections on Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria and avidly read the outdated material on Hungary. And decided, the next morning, on a city tour. <p> And met Roger once again. Two million people in Budapest, 10,000 tourists, and Roger? <p> But there he was at Engels Ter, wandering in obvious confusion among the shiny phalanxes of Ibusz coaches. We sighed, shoved open the window and called to him. Which tour did he want? Ours. Of course. <p> He greeted us with delight and climbed aboard, clutching a bright oversize hardcover guidebook( in English). We had reached our hotel? The cab driver had not abused us? He, Roger, had given his driver a $ 10 bill and was not at all sure it had been enough. We 'd done fine with $ 2, we said dryly. No! Roger -- loudly -- could not believe such a thing to be possible. It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning, crumbling and elegant, the sun glancing off the shellfire pockmarks from one war and another invasion, while the multilingual tour-guide lady switched languages( " Soon, dear friends, we shall be being driven past clinic of most famous Professor Ignaz Semmelweis, which will be being on left side of street -- Professor Semmelweis, who is being renowned throughout world even today for work he shall have been doing in 1840s, when he is discovering these great principles of antisepsis "), we talked to Roger. <p> And Roger, imperceptibly, began to assume a new visage. <p> We had read our Le Carre. We knew you needed cover, we knew you should n't look like much, we knew you ought to fumble a bit and make mistakes. And we knew if you were going to be a tourist, you should look like one, taking boring city tours, clutching guidebooks, being obvious. <p> Roger was tall, with thinning hair and a strong dark face ; one of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a businessman from Mexico City, long resident on the Continent. But his past and present -- told insistently, without prompting -- was more complex than that. <p> As Budapest unfolded around us in the thin sad sunshine, he told us his story. <p> One story, anyway. <p> He lived, Roger said, in Paris. His mother had been Swiss, his father Moroccan. He 'd had a business but sold it recently, after his wife had died. He liked art. Now, he said, there was leisure to travel -- and many museums with very fine paintings in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. So he had signed up for a two-week tour this fall to Moscow and Leningrad, and was now preparing for it. First, this trip to Budapest ; next, Warsaw. This would provide practice in travel to such countries, did we not agree? <p> We agreed. We told Roger of a recent encounter with a chile pepper in an otherwise unremarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authentic places. He wrote down two, and his phone number ; we still have the paper somewhere. His writing was soft and spidery. <p> When the bus stopped at Heroes ' Square, Roger wandered far from the group, head deep in his guidebook, and we lost sight of him for a time. But after we crossed the Danube to Buda, he stuck close. On Castle Hill, when I went into a shop selling embroidery to tourists, Roger strolled the ramparts with my husband. When we had coffee at the Hilton, Roger sat with us on pink plush chairs. When my husband found a bathroom, Roger kept me talking. <p> At Matthias Church, a vaulting Gothic loveliness, he again stayed nearby. And when we saw flyers there for what appeared to be a performance of the Mozart Requiem, he eagerly fetched the tour-guide lady to translate. " Yes, " she said, " such famous Mozart shall be being played and sung tomorrow here, which is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Roger thought this a very good idea and so, briefly, did we. Roger thought we should meet and perhaps dine afterwards. Perhaps, we said, perhaps : We were n't yet sure of our plans. Roger waved happily when we got off the bus. Tomorrow, he called, see you tomorrow! <p> I do n't know if Roger went to the Requiem. We did n't : The next day we walked the city and took a magnificently orchestrated country tour to a collective horse farm and listened to addresses on civic friendship from a suburban mayor and drank barack( gift of the mayor) on the bus with inebriated West Germans. And came back, in a twilight thickened by river mist, tired and sleepy -- and just nervous enough, after a day weaving webs of intrigue around Roger 's inoffensive person, not to go to the Mozart. <p> Roger had given us no packages, no letters, no one to call when we got back to Vienna. The closest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband lit a cigar, in whether we collected match boxes. He himself had such a collection, Roger said, a fine one, already with several from Hungary. Perhaps we had some to trade? <p> Alas, we did not. <p> None of it had felt right, none of it. Le Carre aside, of course, we were more than ready to entertain a small frisson of fear. We 'd been traveling for weeks, mostly in out-of-the-way places, cut off from news except for an occasional Herald Tribune and whatever our shortwave radio could pick up in English. Heads bent to catch the fading voices, we 'd listened to Deutsche Welle and BBC World Service, to Radio Moscow and( so curiously similar) the Voice of America. The BBC was best, but it was hard to get. Things were moving that summer, and we were n't sure how fast. <p> But Roger -- he was a problem, too. That shy, engaging, curiously hopeful smile : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehearsed. And strange. Had he met someone when he left us in the square? Gotten a message? Given one? We 'd been foils, we decided ; Roger had been avoiding something that would n't happen as long as he clung tight. Or proving something. Or simply playing out a charade after the job was done. <p> Back home, as that amazing hopeful year ended, we thought now and then of Roger The Spy, taking his city tours, queueing at museums, overpaying and over-tipping, going ever farther east, into the heart of a darkness that was not perhaps so dark anymore. And scattering, as he went -- what? Dissension? Freedom? Hope? Our own Roger Revolution-Seed. It was a nice idea. <p> Or maybe we had it backward. Maybe Roger was working for the other side. Maybe he was n't Roger Revolution-Seed at all, but a messenger of fear, an envoy of repression, complete with a cover story so glaringly plausible that only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't decide. <p> Like most fantasies and conceits, this one played itself out quickly enough. We read eagerly about the new freedoms, hoped that the kind and frightened people we 'd met in Budapest were prospering, and got on with our lives. It was all very far away. <p> Now, though, as confusion and fear return to the world, I find myself thinking again of Roger. I need Roger now, as I needed him then, to deal with events that seem to be moving ahead blindly, without human purpose or control. Good or evil, he has become my unlikely deus ex machina ; good or evil, he has at least a human face. If he is evil, logic suggests a counterpart ; somewhere, perhaps, someone knows what is going to happen to us all. <p> So now I take him out -- often -- when the news becomes troubling. And I think about him. Has he found museums to visit in Riga and Vilnius, a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see again? Did he miss a bit of sculpture in Leningrad? <p> And where was he last July? Baghdad? Riyadh? I can so easily see that dark face, unremarkable but unforgettable, on crowded streets in Amman or Tunis or Tangiers. He would n't need to be a tourist, there. He could move freely, there. <p> What side was he on, when we met him? What side is he on today? <p> He is on a train somewhere, when I think of him now, smiling faintly out a dusty window into a gathering darkness, seeming not to notice as the train picks up speed. But I ca n't tell which direction the train is traveling, not in the dark, and I feel cold.
