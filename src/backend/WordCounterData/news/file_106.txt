3019841 <p> Former general manager Ron Wolf said Thursday that the Green Bay Packers have what it takes to make a Super Bowl run even without injured safeties Antuan Edwards and LeRoy Butler. <p> " I would think so. They still have their quarterback. They ca n't take any more hits, though, " Wolf said. " And they have to get Wayne back. They have to get him back, not just three-quarters of Nate Wayne, all of Nate Wayne. " <p> Wayne played the first half last week against the New York Giants in his first action since breaking a small bone in his back Dec. 9. When he got hurt, he was the team 's leading tackler. <p> The Packers ' run defense fell apart without Wayne and with the other starting linebackers - Na'il Diggs( elbow) and Bernardo Harris( hand) - playing through injuries that have affected their tackling abilities. <p> " Those linebackers have to play, " Wolf said. " There 's too much running going on there now. " <p> The Packers have allowed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards. <p> Wolf, who retired last summer, said he was impressed by the job Mike Sherman has done juggling the dual job as coach and general manager. <p> " I think what he 's done is remarkable, " Wolf said. " That 's an incredible job he 's done. Considering the pressure he 's under and to go 12-4, that 's unbelievable. " <p> In an interview from his retirement home in Annapolis, Md., Wolf said he expected nothing less, however, when he left the team in Sherman 's hands. <p> " Now, they 're a little beat up at linebacker. It hurts them. But they 're probably no different than any team going into the playoffs from an injury standpoint, " Wolf said. <p> Wolf said he likes the way rookie cornerback Bhawoh Jue has stepped in and played safety with Edwards and Butler sidelined by injuries and Chris Akins cut for insubordination. <p> Still, Wolf said having to play a rookie cornerback at safety " is part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So, what do the Packers have to do to make another run at a title? <p> " I think they just have to play to their capabilities and they 'll win it, " Wolf said. " You do n't go 12-4 and do it with mirrors, and you can think of two games they should have won. They should have been 14-2, so this is a really good football team. They 're just hurt. <p> " You lose three key players in this era of free agency at one position, that 's devastating, particularly when you lose Butler and Edwards. Akins, I mean, he 's not in that class, but at least he 's experienced at knowing what 's going on. " <p> Wolf said he was n't surprised tight end Bubba Franks made the Pro Bowl but he thought cornerback Mike McKenzie deserved to the same honor. <p> Also, Wolf said that quarterback Brett Favre should have beaten out St. Louis ' Kurt Warner as league MVP. <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the league? Yes, I do, " Wolf said. " Did he do more with less? I do n't know. I mean, Bubba Franks is certainly better than whoever the tight end is with St. Louis. You know, I ca n't say Ahman Green is better than Marshall Faulk. But I think( Torry) Holt and( Isaac) Bruce are better( than the Packers ' receivers). I guess. So, yeah, I think he 's the best player in the league. People who vote do n't. " <p> Favre took a distant third in the MVP balloting this week. <p> Wolf also said he did n't think Michael Strahan 's easy sack of Favre on Sunday to break Mark Gastineau 's record will harm Favre 's legacy. <p> " I do n't think so. I do n't think it did anything, " Wolf said. " No, it 's just like whoever threw the 70th home run ball to McGwire, whoever threw the 70-whatever-it-was home run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to know who. I do n't know if anybody knows whether those were, what do you call them, lob balls, or not. They just went out of the park. No one knows that. <p> " No one will know this, either. If in fact that was a setup or anything else. " <p> Wolf also reiterated that he does n't foresee himself returning to the NFL despite constant speculation that the Washington Redskins will try to lure him out of retirement. <p> JUE &; JENKINS : @ All of the Packers ' injured players practiced Thursday, although safety Bhawoh Jue shared snaps with Billy Jenkins. <p> Jue, who turned his right ankle in practice last week, sustained a concussion and bruised ribs last Sunday. So, the Packers are playing it safe with him. <p> He 's listed as probable on the injury report, as are nose tackle Gilbert Brown( foot), linebacker Na'il Diggs( calf), quarterback Brett Favre( side, back) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's a little bit of soreness in the ribs, " Jue said. " There 's no need in going out there and aggravating it the week before the playoffs, so just taking it a little easy. <p> " I 'm at practice without any tape or anything today( on the ankle), and I find my way home at night, so it 's not the concussion, " Jue added. " It 's just the ribs are a little sore right now. " <p> Although secondary coach Bob Slowik said the Packers are counting on Jue to play, Jue was noncommittal about his availability for Sunday 's game. <p> " It 's tough to say right now, " Jue said. " We 'll see. I do n't want to go in there and jeopardize the team 's ability to win the game by going out there and not being mentally prepared and knowing what I 'm doing. I 'm going to give it as much as I can tomorrow and we 'll see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a possibility was sharing snaps with Jenkins on game day. <p> " No, man. We ca n't do that in a game, " Jue said. " You ca n't do that and expect somebody to get in any kind of a flow. It 's tough to do that, play two people. So, if I ca n't do it, I 'll tell Coach Sherman I ca n't go. And Billy 's started in the NFL before, so there 's not going to be any kind of dropoff. " <p> Jenkins was signed late in the season but has n't played much despite the Packers losing Antuan Edwards( knee), LeRoy Butler( shoulder) and Chris Akins( attitude) at safety. <p> Jenkins is a seasoned veteran, starting in St. Louis and Denver over the last several seasons. <p> " I 'm very familiar with the Packers ' scheme, " Jenkins said. " It 's the same scheme we ran last year in Denver, so I have no problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I 've played them a lot over my career and they have n't changed a lot. " <p> Jenkins said he was eager to face the 49ers Sunday. <p> " It 's a chance for me to prove to all my teammates that have n't really had the opportunity to see me play and to prove myself to the coaches and to everyone who really does n't know about me, " Jenkins said. " Or forgot about me. " <p> Slowik also said he was impressed with Allen Rossum 's work as the sixth defensive back. The Packers need Rossum to be able to play in the secondary for them to activate him as the punt returner Sunday, coach Mike Sherman said. <p> " It looks like he 's pretty much full speed, looks like he 's ready to go, " Slowik said. <p> EXTRA POINTS : @ Should the Packers make it to the Super Bowl, the bulk of the team 's ticket allotment will go to season ticketholders, and those recipients already have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account was eligible for two tickets, at $400 apiece.
