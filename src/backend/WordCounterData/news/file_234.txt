3044041 <p> During the countless drives she made through the heart of the Poncey-Highland neighborhood just east of downtown Atlanta, Lynda Idleman shared a similar experience with thousands of other commuters who find themselves in traffic along North and Ponce de Leon avenues. <p> Few realize they are on the edge of a mushrooming residential area with one of the city 's largest green spaces and some of its most affordable intown housing. <p> " I used to drive through and not pay any attention to the neighborhood at all, " said Idleman, " even though I had followed the fight over the( Freedom) freeway and had friends who actually chained themselves to equipment and trees before the settlement. " <p> The battle through the 1980s and early 1990s to stop construction of a major thoroughfare that would have cut a path through neighborhoods from downtown to the Carter Center and beyond may be the only mention people recall of Poncey-Highland. <p> Its proximity to the presidential center and its closeness to downtown put it squarely in the middle of the planned highway, which eventually became the Freedom Parkway. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy the winding trails of Freedom Park may be unaware of the burgeoning community around them. <p> " The biggest change here is all the new building and the loft construction throughout the neighborhood, " said an amazed Bob Hanes, who has lived in Poncey-Highland since 1986. <p> " There 's hardly any vacant land left, and property values have gone sky-high. When I bought, I paid $40,000 for a pretty typical brick bungalow with two bedrooms and one bath. It recently appraised at $150,000. But people are moving in here and thinking nothing of paying $350,000 for a house. " <p> Hanes, a past president of the neighborhood association, said the rediscovery of the area 's affordable housing stock, potential loft properties and open space by numerous newcomers has given the community a new energy. <p> " We have a lot more participation in the neighborhood association, and a lot of people moving into the lofts have gotten active, " said Hanes. <p> " There 's usually a core group that winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very interested in and protective of the neighborhood because of the huge investment they 've made. And that 's been a very positive impact. " <p> One of those newcomers making an impact is Idleman, a marketing-research consultant who moved with her partner, Mark Smith, from Lake Claire to Poncey-Highland more than a year ago. She recently took over the helm of the neighborhood association. <p> " We wanted to live in a neighborhood where you could walk. We did n't want to use our cars at all, " said Idleman. <p> " There are 30 restaurants within a 15-minute walk, and there are grocery stores, dry cleaners and banks nearby. Of course, that also brings a lot of traffic and people into the area, but when you move here, you know what 's going to happen. " <p> Idleman also became an owner of one of the new housing developments in the area. Her four-story townhouse near the corner of North and Bonaventure avenues offers 180-degree views of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at renovated industrial buildings in Copenhill, where 40 new condos priced from $200,000 to $400,000 came with concrete floors, granite counters, solid wood cabinets, stainless steel appliances and oversized windows. <p> They 're buying up converted units in the 1920s building at 653 Bonaventure, where one- and two-bedroom units have been updated with new systems, baths, kitchens and front porches. <p> And they 're awaiting the arrival of condominiums in the Freedom Lofts, where 60 units are being carved out of the former National Linen Service building. The property 's hardwood floors, 25-foot ceilings, upgraded kitchen appliances and sealed concrete floors are helping sales from the high $100,000s into the $300,000s. <p> " I 've looked at a lot of lofts, and this one has a location that 's really nice, " said Freedom buyer Troy King, whose two-bedroom, two-bath unit will have 30-foot ceilings and concrete floors. <p> " It 's very central to about everything in Atlanta, and within five minutes of good bike-riding distance to Midtown, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and having the park there is a big deal. " <p> The neighborhood 's new popularity amuses Lee Echols, a past association president who has lived there with his family since 1995. <p> " This has always been a ' passing-through ' neighborhood, one you 'd drive through going from one area to the next, " he said. " People are now realizing that there 's lots to do here and that it 's a good place to raise a family. " <p> Echols ' family is the second to live in the 1921, red-brick Craftsman cottage on a secluded street near the Freedom Parkway. <p> " It 's a very quiet, out-of-the-way street that 10 years ago bustled with buses and people going to downtown, " he said. " Now, because of the parkway, it 's no longer a cut-through. It 's quite pleasant. " <p> But the thing that makes the area most attractive, said Echols, is Freedom Park, an X-shaped swath of land that meets at the Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The park has crystalized the Poncey-Highland neighborhood in a way we have n't seen since the parkway battle years ago, " said Echols. <p> " It 's ongoing development is really the foundation of the new Poncey-Highland neighborhood. It 's also an enormous amenity, and we feel a great sense of responsibility to carrying on the work that has been done with it. A park always has to be nurtured and cared for, and that 's, to a large degree, the responsibility of the neighbors who enjoy the park. " <p> Part of that responsibility involves planning. The neighborhood association is involved in studies looking at development in the area, from new projects to renovating older industrial properties along the community 's western edge. <p> Though residents are split over whether future development should focus on single-family housing or high-density projects, most agree protecting the area 's green space will continue to be an important objective. <p> " We 're small geographically, but nearly 50 percent of our land is anchored by green space, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " said Echols. " That alone is going to make us a very desirable neighborhood for many years to come. " <p> History <p> During the Civil War, Union forces overlooked Atlanta from the hills of what is now the Poncey-Highland neighborhood. Today, these hills also are home to the Carter Center and Freedom Park, two of the city 's largest green spaces. <p> The oldest section of the neighborhood was built along Moreland Avenue and, in the early 1900s, residents of the vicinity could commute to jobs downtown by riding the city 's trolleys. <p> As cars became the more popular mode of transportation, the neighborhood grew west, where modest Craftsman bungalows and business establishments were built. <p> In the 1980s and early 1990s, residents of the area rallied against plans to build a major thoroughfare through the community from downtown to the Carter Center and beyond. Since the major thoroughfare was abandoned and a smaller parkway built, the neighborhood has worked on plans to revitalize the area, including the construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Households About 600 <p> Property taxes About $5,067 on a $300,000 house with homestead exemption <p> Landmarks The Carter Center Freedom Park <p> Amenities Proximity to Midtown and downtown Walking distance to shopping, restaurants and entertainment venues <p> Schools Mary Lin Elementary, K-5 ; 404-371-7185.
