3005741 <p> The Boston Globe, one of the few large American newspapers that remain under family control, is to be sold to The New York Times Company under a $1.1 billion merger agreement approved yesterday by the boards of both companies. <p> The deal provides that The Globe will retain its management and editorial autonomy. Yet it would add to the decades-long centralization of American communications, under which many independently owned news organizations have been sold or closed down. It would also considerably expand the role of the Times Company and its controlling family, the Sulzbergers, in the country 's media. Purchase Price a Record <p> The purchase price, to be paid largely in the stock of The New York Times Company, is the highest ever for an American newspaper, securities analysts said this week as rumors of the proposed deal spread in Boston and on Wall Street. <p> The companies valued the offer for The Globe 's parent company, Affiliated Publications Inc., at $15 a share for each share of Affiliated. The stock of Affiliated declined 25 cents a share yesterday, to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Times Company 's class A stock fell 62.5 cents a share, to $26.875, on the American Stock Exchange. What the companies called a " definitive agreement " was signed early today. The deal remains subject to approval by shareholders of both publicly traded companies. <p> The Taylor family of Boston has run The Globe since 1873. Two family trusts that control Affiliated expire in 1996, and it had long been expected that the company would sell before then to avoid the danger of a hostile takeover or a battle among the heirs. ' An Extraordinary Opportunity ' <p> The merger would bring The Globe, the largest newspaper in New England, into the Times Company. It would extend the company 's reach in a broad corridor from Maine to Washington, D.C., giving it a huge new advertising market in New England. <p> Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the chairman of The New York Times Company, called the deal " an extraordinary opportunity that we could not let pass. " Ownership of The Globe, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of information and a conduit for advertising. <p> William O. Taylor, the fourth generation of the Taylor family to be publisher of The Globe, called the agreement " a superb opportunity to protect the franchise. " <p> In a joint telephone interview from Boston with Mr. Sulzberger, Mr. Taylor, who is also Affiliated 's chairman, added : " We think their long-term commitment to journalistic excellence is exactly what we are for. It 's a good deal for our shareholders and for the community. " <p> Under the agreement, The Globe 's current management is to remain in place for at least five years. After that, Mr. Taylor said last night, he had received a " moral commitment " from The Times that members of the Taylor family could have the chance to run the newspaper. Mr. Taylor, 60, also said he had won a promise to select his successor when he retires. <p> In the joint interview, Mr. Sulzberger said, " We 're not going to come in and shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Globe, which has prized its independence for more than a century, would also retain what the companies ' statement called " full editorial autonomy, " although the details of the agreement were not released yesterday. " There will be no editorial policy changes at The Globe resulting from this alliance, " Mr. Taylor said. <p> In the interview, Mr. Sulzberger said : " The New York Times Company will own it. But the newspaper will maintain its editorial independence. " <p> The Globe, with a weekday circulation of 504,869 and Sunday circulation of 811,409, is by far the largest newspaper in New England and is one of the 15 largest newspapers in the United States. It dwarfs its combative Boston competitor, The Boston Herald, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch 's News America Publishing Company. The Herald has a daily circulation of 337,543 and a Sunday circulation of 233,507. <p> The New York Times is the largest metropolitan and Sunday newspaper in the United States, with daily circulation of 1,230,461 and Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Times, the Times Company, with $1.8 billion in annual revenues, owns 31 regional newspapers, 20 magazines, 5 television stations, 2 radio stations and other businesses. It also has a half-interest, with The Washington Post Company, in The International Herald Tribune. <p> In addition to The Globe newspaper, Affiliated owns 33 percent of BPI Communications, a publishing company with 19 magazines, including Adweek, Billboard and The Hollywood Reporter. Option of Taking Cash <p> Under the agreement announced yesterday, the Times Company will exchange all of Affiliated 's stock for New York Times class A common shares. Holders of Affiliated 's class A stock will have the option of receiving cash for up to 15 percent of their Affiliated shares. <p> This week, as word of the possible agreement spread among financial and newspaper securities analysts, some were enthusiastic about the prospect that the Times Company might establish a firm hold on such a densely populated region. Others expressed skepticism about a strategic decision to invest the company so heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in recent years even though it still produces substantial profits. <p> Mr. Sulzberger said yesterday that he believed analysts who predicted the death of the newspaper business were wrong. He said that The Boston Globe could become an attractive part of the company 's offerings to advertisers and that there could be joint advertising sales. Even if newsprint is eventually replaced by electronic delivery of information, Mr. Sulzberger said, businesses like The Times and The Globe will remain viable because of their information-gathering abilities. <p> " I think it 's going to be a very, very long time before newspapers disappear, " Mr. Sulzberger said. " Anyway, we 're not buying just a newspaper. We 're buying an organization that gathers the news, transmits the news. And if it turns out in 50 years that it 's all electronic, we 're ready for that too. " <p> Mr. Sulzberger also dismissed concerns that have made a ripple at The Globe in recent days : that the newspaper might be vulnerable to cost cutting or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retain its own news operations, including a separate system of news bureaus, and he said the Times Company had not interfered in the news operations of its other newspapers. <p> Under the agreement approved at separate board meetings in Boston and New York yesterday, The Globe will have three representatives on the Times Company board. The Times Company will have 60 percent of the votes on a new Globe board. <p> Lawyers for The Times said they had reached a " lockout " agreement that would make it difficult for another suitor to purchase The Globe at this point. <p> If the sale of the Boston newspaper is completed, it will mark the end of one of the most complex -- and private -- corporate dramas in recent years. Since 1873, two families have controlled the Boston newspaper. The heirs of Eben D. Jordan, the founder of the Jordan Marsh stores, who was one of the original investors, shared the ownership with the heirs of Charles Henry Taylor, Mr. Jordan 's business manager. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expire in 1996, the two families own a third of the stock of Affiliated, which became a public company in 1973. But together, the trusts control 68 percent of Affiliated 's voting power. <p> Affiliated has two classes of stock. Each class A share entitles the holder to one vote and each B share entitles the holder to 10 votes. <p> The Jordan heirs drifted away not only from the newspaper, but from America as well ; Eben Jordan 's youngest daughter married Queen Victoria 's personal chaplain and settled in England. <p> Several branches of the Taylor family remained involved in The Globe through the generations. Benjamin B. Taylor, 46, a cousin of the current publisher, appeared to be moving toward taking over the newspaper himself. Just three weeks ago, The Globe announced that Benjamin Taylor had been made president of the company, the same job his father, John I. Taylor, assumed 30 years ago. <p> There are about 100 Taylor heirs, many of whom are not involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some of them, and some of the Jordan heirs, were growing impatient with their ties to the newspaper. A Balancing Act <p> It was an open secret in the newspaper business that William O. Taylor, the current publisher, was involved in a balancing act, trying to keep the heirs in line while planning for the inevitable expiration of the trust in 1996. <p> Mr. Taylor insisted that the newspaper needed its independence, but he worried about what might happen when the trusts lapsed. His fear, people who talked to him said, was that The Globe could become the object of a hostile takeover attempt from a company that would not maintain its journalism standards. <p> Even worse, in Mr. Taylor 's mind, some who talked to him said, was the possibility that the heirs might begin to battle one another. Michael C. Janeway, who was editor of The Globe for a time in the 1980 's, said Mr. Taylor was especially upset as he watched the Bingham family of Louisville, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale of The Courier-Journal to the Gannett Company in 1986. <p> " He was really rocked, " Mr. Janeway said this week, remembering a conversation with The Globe 's publisher. " And he said to me, ' We have to reassess all of our assumptions. ' " Previous Suitors <p> Over the years, various companies made passes at The Globe. The Times Mirror Company, The Washington Post Company, the Tribune Company of Chicago and the Newhouse family newspaper organization were among the companies that newspaper people said had made themselves available as possible suitors. <p> Against that complicated backdrop, executives of The New York Times Company and William O. Taylor began talks that led to a buyout proposal last winter. Many of the details of those negotiations are not known. But it is known that during the winter, at the last minute, on the verge of a sale to The New York Times, Affiliated 's board said no to its latest suitor. <p> New negotiations this spring involved a detailed agreement over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Last night, William O. Taylor said that as he presented The Times 's latest offer there were no special pressures among the heirs. " No pressure at all, " he said. " But there was a recognition that the world is changing.
