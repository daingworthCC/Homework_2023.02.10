3014241 <p> The harvest has been abundant this year - fat tomatoes, sweet potatoes, melons, pecans and purple-hull peas. The rains came, as farmers gathered in a spring field prayed they would. <p> " We were blessed, " produce grower Louis Lazzari said. <p> At Thanksgiving dinner in Annie White 's house, the grace her ill 80-year-old husband Jack plans to say will be simple : " He 'll say he hopes it continues. " <p> By that, she meant not just the fecundity of the good earth here by Mobile Bay, but the sharing of its riches between farmers like Lazzari and families like hers, families in need, through people known as " gleaners. " <p> From bean-growing time in the spring to the gathering of mustard greens, turnips and broccoli in cool weather, farmers invite the gleaners into their fields to take what 's left behind after harvest. <p> On one afternoon this summer, 200 hands picked 16,220 pounds of tomatoes. Altogether last year, the gleaners, organized by a local group called Ecumenical Ministries, carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickers must be needy. They can not sell anything they glean. And they must share it with someone else in need - such as the Whites, who can not pick on their own because they 're disabled. <p> The rules are as simple as the verses from the Old Testament that underlie the 10-year-old project. <p> " When thou cuttest down thine harvest... and hast forgotten a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it, " enjoins Deuteronomy 24:19-21. <p> " It shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow. That the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands. " <p> Mrs. White, who at 69 has heart trouble and more other ailments than she can name, and whose husband has cancer, learned of Ecumenical Ministries about eight years ago, on a day she was desperate for food. " That day, I really did n't have anything to cook, " she said. <p> " Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were out with boxes and bags of groceries, " she said. <p> After that, gleaners brought regular deliveries of whatever vegetable was in season. Without the food, she said, " I guess I 'd starve. " <p> The program began a decade ago with Dot Threadgill, who saw a television news item about people from a California senior citizens center who supplemented their diet by picking leftovers in the fields. <p> Mrs. Threadgill 's energy seems to keep the gleaning operations going - and growing, from about 300 pounds of food distributed during the first year, " about half of that out of my garden, " she said. <p> Now, 15 farmers call her or she calls them as harvests near. And she 's learned tricks over the years. <p> " Mechanical harvesters ca n't pick where they turn, at the end of the rows, " she said, referring to potato picking machines. " So we know where to be. " <p> She scouts the fields, estimating how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want them to use their gas money and not have sufficient for several days. " Then she quickly goes to the " telephone tree " to mobilize pickers before the farmer plows the field under to prepare for the next crop. <p> Suzanne Zellner got a call when a turnip patch was offered recently. She and her husband have five children, the youngest 2 -year-old twins. Besides improving nutrition and stretching grocery money, gleaning has an educational value, she said, teaching children " how to pick, how to know when something 's ready or when it 's too ripe. " <p> Another regular in the fields is Gussie Winston, 53, who first went gleaning because her family had nothing to eat, but now makes ends meet with housekeeping jobs and gleans and cans vegetables for herself and a list of mostly elderly people unable to get out themselves. <p> " When you become a gleaner, you 're an emissary, " she said, looking across a sunny field to pickers stooped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one goes hungry. " <p> For Mrs. Threadgill, that requires judicious juggling of her phone list. For instance, she said, " I know that Mary Jones has 10 or 15 people under her ; so I know that if there 's only enough for 10 or 15 I do n't need to call but Mary... <p> " And if we get peas for Mary this week, we call somebody else, and kind of divide around the wealth. " <p> And the wealth keeps blooming. <p> Around the Fourth of July, one farmer makes sure to call the gleaners to gather ripe watermelons. <p> Just before Christmas last year, a rare spell of extreme cold brought a call from another farmer who said he could n't protect all of his broccoli crop. The gleaners cut 1,200 pounds. <p> A grower who has a U-pick operation, with tomatoes planted in a staggered schedule, offers the gleaners what 's left in " dead-ripe patches " that his paying customers picked through the week before. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his farm, 60-year-old Louis Lazzari said the vagaries of the market sometimes open his fields to the gleaners. <p> " This year, one day I sold my broker 240 bushel boxes of beans and he wanted the next day 340, " he said. " I had the beans, some of the prettiest I ever raised in my life. " But the going price would n't have covered expenses. " After I paid the help, I paid for the box, I paid the freight to the place of business, I do n't know honestly but I may have went backwards. <p> " I could have plowed ' em under, " Lazzari said. But really he could n't. " It hurts me so bad to see something... go to waste, " he said. And he knows there are plenty of people here who have n't had his good fortune. <p> " I was born in the Depression, " he said, " but I never had to go to bed one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm thankful to say. " <p> Instead of plowing those pretty beans under, he phoned Mrs. Threadgill. <p> Once, a few years ago, Lazzari spontaneously called and offered sweet corn, 30 big croker sacks full. <p> Mrs. Threadgill went back a few days later to thank him with a cake. " He said, ' You know, I had that big field of corn, and it was n't moving. After I gave you that 30 sacks, that evening a man came and bought the whole field from me.
