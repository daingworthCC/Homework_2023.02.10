3030541 <p> NEW YORK -- Trish Straine caught herself thinking about that word, widow, while shopping in an athletic shoe store last week. <p> Her husband Jimmy, 36, a rising star at Cantor Fitzgerald bond trading firm, perished in the terrorist attacks Sept. 11 on the World Trade Center. <p> After almost a month of wallowing in that nightmare, she decided it was time to get out of the house and into the gym to work off her pent-up emotion as well as firm up her body. Just 6 days before the attacks, she had given birth to the couple 's second child, Charlie. <p> " There I was, buying sneakers, when I suddenly thought, ' I 'm a widow! ' " Straine says. " Then, I said to myself, ' A widow? That 's an older woman, who 's dressed in black. It 's certainly not a 32-year-old like me. ' " <p> Straine, whose other son, Finn, turns 3 next month, is n't the only young widow -- or the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster. <p> According to USA TODAY 's compilation of those dead and missing at the World Trade Center, 81% are men, and their median age is 39. Mayor Rudy Giuliani estimates that as many as 10,000 children have lost a parent in the tragedy, but no one is really sure if the number is that high. And at least a dozen men left behind pregnant wives, according to the newspaper 's compilation. <p> These young widows are maneuvering through unfamiliar territory. Some are filling out death certificates, setting up memorial funds for their children 's college educations and applying for financial aid from the Red Cross. Some are contacting credit card companies to explain why they ca n't pay this month 's bills. Some are seeking counseling to help with their grief. <p> They 're deeply hurt. <p> And they 're mad as hell. <p> " How many people had to screw up on Sept. 11 for something like this to happen? " says Nancy Moroney, 39, whose husband, Dennis, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was n't just one plane, it was four. This was a major screw up. <p> " I always thought that our country was the best, that we had top-notch intelligence. But if that 's true, how come nobody figured this out before it happened? " <p> Moroney had spent the summer planning a surprise birthday party for her husband, who would 've turned 40 on Nov. 7. Instead, she hosted a reception after his memorial service at their Eastchester, N.Y., home. She 's now raising two children, Elizabeth, 11, and Timothy, 9, on her own. <p> ' So senseless, so brutal, so evil ' <p> " This was all so senseless, so brutal, so evil, " Moroney says. " Our lives will never be the same. And it stinks. " <p> Trish Straine is mad at the U.S. government, too. <p> " I think it 's unbelievable that they knew 24 hours later who all the hijackers were, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence. I ca n't believe we did n't know it was coming. " Then, she catches herself. <p> " When will the terrorists strike again? What will they come at us with this time? " Straine says. " It makes me so sad that more lives will be lost, but we have to get Osama bin Laden. I just hope that 18 years from now my two sons wo n't be called into the military. " <p> But Straine is even angrier at the 1 World Trade Center building, where Cantor Fitzgerald had offices on floors 101-105. The company lost more than 700 of its 1,000-plus employees. The 320 survivors were not in the tower that morning. <p> " I always thought it was a death trap, " Straine says. " They were 110-story buildings built purely for ego. The stairwells were only two-people wide. It should 've taken 3 minutes to get down from the top. <p> " It made me sick to my stomach to visit Jimmy 's office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a beautiful view? Look, we 're higher than the helicopters. ' They gave each other gas masks for Christmas. Another guy kept a parachute at his desk. After the 1993 terrorist attack, you think somebody would 've done something to make that building safer. " <p> Moroney admits she never felt comfortable in the twin towers either. <p> Only 2 weeks before the attacks, she and the children had gone to a country music concert in the plaza area of the buildings. While they were waiting for Dennis to join them, they went to the observation deck at the top of 2 World Trade Center. <p> " When we were waiting for the elevator that day, Timothy asked, ' Why ca n't we take the steps? ' " she says. " And I remember explaining to him that it would take hours and hours to climb to the top. <p> " We used to tell all of our friends, ' We 'll take you up to Dennis ' office. It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever. ' But the truth was, Dennis was afraid of heights. He could n't go to the window and look out. It gave him the creeps. " <p> Many widows say they are taking life one day at a time, focusing on the short term. <p> " Who 's going to hand out the Halloween candy this year? " says Nancy Shea, 45, who lost her husband Joe, 47, a Cantor Fitzgerald executive. " That was Joe 's job. " <p> The Sheas were married 16 years and had four children( Patrick, 14, Peter, 12, Casey, 10, and Danny, 7). <p> ' An extremely hands-on father ' <p> " Four children, nine teams, 18 games a week, " says Shea, who was in charge of transportation, while Joe coached the various soccer, hockey and basketball teams. " On weekends, he 'd get his schedule from me. He was an extremely hands-on father. " <p> Shea, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raise her family, could best be described as the Superwoman of Pelham, N.Y. Her weekdays started at 6:30 a.m., when Joe went to work, and ended at 11:30 p.m., when the homework was done and the children were in bed. <p> She volunteers at each of her children 's schools and is active in the Junior League and other charities. Now, she 's adding on financial decision-making, paying the bills and taking out the trash. <p> " I used to tease Joe... ' You do n't know where the pediatrician 's is. You ca n't find the orthodontist 's office, ' " she says. " Every December, I 'd take him down to the basement and say, ' If I die, you need to know where all the presents are hidden. ' " <p> At the Moroneys, on the other hand, it was dad who ran the show. <p> " Dennis did everything, " Nancy Moroney says. " He mowed the lawn, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You should know how to do this. ' I 'd say, ' No, you 're doing such a good job. ' <p> " Dennis was the fun one, the life of the party, charming to perfect strangers. This is the first year Timothy will camp out with the Boy Scouts. My husband 's brother will go with him, but Timothy said, ' Mom, I hardly know him. It 'll be so sad without dad. ' What do you do? I ca n't ever take away their sadness. " <p> And Moroney, like many other widows of the disaster, worries about other insurmountable hurdles. While her husband had life insurance, Moroney does n't think the money is enough to support the family beyond 2 years. <p> " I ca n't even see telling the kids we 're going to have to move, " she says. " I ca n't even think about getting a job right now. I do n't want my kids ' lives to change so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest concern <p> In the Straines ' household, dad was the swim coach, sandcastle builder, fisherman and sports fanatic, all rolled into one. <p> " I 'm worried about not having a father for them, " Straine says. " Jimmy balanced me so well. He was the better parent, more patient and understanding. <p> " Kids who are raised by one parent can obviously grow up happy, well-rounded, and be fine. But if you have two loving parents, it makes such a difference. I do n't know how to fish. I do n't know how to raise boys. I had two sisters. But Jimmy had three brothers. " <p> How the deaths will impact their children, emotionally, intellectually and spiritually, is probably the biggest long-term concern. <p> Jeannine Baron, 36, lost her husband Evan, 39, an energy broker for Carr Futures. Now, she 's trying to raise two children, Ethan, 6, and Julia, who will be 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions, having already gotten him into counseling at his kindergarten in Bridgewater, N.J., and at the local Jewish Community Center. <p> " When I picked him up from the center the other day, they told me I did n't have to pay anymore, " she says with relief. " I could n't have afforded it otherwise. " <p> A few days after the attacks, Baron told her son there 'd been an explosion in his father 's building and that a lot of people had died, were missing or in hospitals. <p> A few days later, after Ethan became agitated, she explained that his father had died and assured him that she and every other relative would be involved in his life, that he 'd never be left alone. <p> " Why did n't you tell me he was dead before today? " Ethan asked, angrily. " Because I wanted to make sure he was really dead, " his mother replied. She 'd waited until his body had been recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ethan said. <p> " He will always be around, " she told her son. " He 'll visit you in your dreams. " <p> Straine waited several days after the attack before telling Finn what happened. <p> But he knew something was amiss because their home in Oceanport, N.J., had been overflowing with family and friends. <p> " Where is my dad? " he asked one morning. Straine said her son told her he 'd seen his father at his grandparents ' house. She figured he 'd had a bad dream. <p> " Daddy 's an angel, " his mother told him. " He 's with Jesus, up in heaven. Tonight, we 'll go outside, look up at the stars and talk to him. " <p> Finn raced to the window. <p> " I ca n't see him, " he said. " But he can see you, " she told him. <p> Later that morning, Finn 's teacher reported that he had cried during class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But that 's OK, " Straine says. " I do n't want him to lose his memories of his father. " <p> And after trying to soothe their children 's fears and concerns, the widows struggle to find their own understanding. <p> Although their husbands have been called patriots and heroes, they 're haunted about their loved ones ' final minutes. <p> " I 'm very, very disturbed by how gruesome this was, " Moroney said. " The psychiatrist with the Red Cross told me it does n't matter how he died. The end result is the same. But I ca n't stop thinking about it. I need to know he died instantaneously. I ca n't bear to think that he suffered. " <p> And because most of the bodies probably wo n't ever be recovered from the site, there may be little, if any, closure. <p> " Jimmy was such a history buff, and it 's comforting that he 'll go down in history, " Straine says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this vicious attack on the United States as opposed to a car accident. " <p> She pauses. " I just need to see him, " Straine says softly. " All I want to do is touch him. " <p> Baron, who says she believes in the supernatural and reincarnation, can sense her husband 's spirit around her. She 's not convinced that he 's completely gone. <p> " I felt him in bed with me the night after the attacks, " Baron says. " I could hear the pillow crackle, feel it on my arms. The other day, I was standing in the bathroom, and I could feel him rubbing my back. I said, ' Can I hug you, Evan? ' I turned around and hugged the air. And the hair on my arms stood up. "
