3004641 <p> On the day that Enron Field made its debut in April 2000, its " Diamond Club " was a portrait in power. <p> In the state-of-the-art baseball stadium 's most exclusive section, behind home plate, there were the George Bushes -- a former president and a president to be -- along with the younger Mr. Bush 's running mate, Dick Cheney, and his successor as governor, Rick Perry. Nearby was Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, whose husband, Ray, is a lawyer with Enron 's chief law firm, Vinson &; Elkins. And then came the executives of Houston 's biggest companies, who had vied to become the younger Bush 's most prominent fund-raisers, just as they had jockeyed to buy the prized luxury seats. <p> And at the center of it all, down on the pitcher 's mound, was Kenneth L. Lay, the man responsible for building Enron into an American powerhouse, throwing out the first ball. <p> If the cozy intertwining of business and politics at Enron Field is not unique to Houston or to Texas, it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day. Now, in the company 's spectacular collapse, the relationships are starkly visible once more, as Congress and the Justice Department ask whether that closeness, a part of the city 's heritage, was at least partly to blame. <p> " It 's a classic example of the circle of influence and inside connections that this entire case typifies, " said Scott Harshbarger, president of Common Cause. " And it 's not only about these guys. It 's what has been happening in Washington for so long now. " <p> Investigators are questioning whether Enron 's outside auditors and lawyers abandoned their function of providing checks and balances against corporate excess. They are looking at Arthur Andersen, which so thoroughly blended its corporate DNA with its client 's that a steady stream of Andersen employees came to work for Enron at the trading company 's futuristic downtown tower. Similar questions are being asked of Vinson &; Elkins, another recruiting depot for Enron, which reviewed internal accusations of wrongdoing and cleared the company. Enron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andersen $52 million. <p> The culture in which Enron flourished blends politics, business and social relationships so thoroughly that the distinctions sometimes lose their meaning. The internal pressure applied to employees at Enron, at Vinson &; Elkins and at Arthur Andersen to contribute to the companies ' political action committees was heavy, according to interviews and documents. Each of the companies ranked among the Bush presidential campaign 's 10 largest contributors. <p> According to one employee, when a participant in Enron 's official online chat room brought up the support for Mr. Bush, Mr. Lay responded that Enron would do well with or without George W. Bush, but that the corporation would benefit from his election. <p> For Mr. Lay, that day at Enron Field, when his company stood at the center of power and influence, was especially sweet, because just a few years earlier, he was an outsider planning a revolution. <p> " They kind of burst on the scene in the 90 's, " said Bob Lanier, who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a sharp rise. " <p> Mr. Lay started in Houston with an unglamorous natural gas pipeline company. In moves that are now well known, he hired a brash young consultant, Jeffrey K. Skilling, away from McKinsey &; Company to transform the energy business from a sedate, regulated world of public utilities to a more free-for-all market. <p> " This is the future, " Mr. Skilling told The Houston Chronicle at the unveiling of the company 's trading floor in 1994. " The utilities do n't have this. This is what the utilities fear. " <p> A bitter rivalry took shape here between Mr. Lay 's Enron and the old energy establishment, most prominently Houston Lighting and Power, the local utility, led by Don Jordan. The enmity between the two men was known from Houston to Washington, where they testified on opposite sides of the deregulation debate. <p> Enron won those fights to open up natural gas and electricity to competition, and it became Houston 's signature company. Mr. Lay, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business association, the Greater Houston Partnership. Along with former President George Bush and former Secretary of State James A. Baker 3rd, he became one of Houston 's leading statesmen. He helped raise more than $100 million for his alma mater, the University of Houston, and pushed for new stadiums for Houston 's professional sports teams. With his wife, Linda, he supported the symphony, the ballet and seemingly every other institution in town. He also opposed efforts to roll back affirmative action programs. <p> " He did so many things that were helpful to the city -- that 's a hell of a way to get some followers, " said Mr. Lanier, himself independently wealthy. " My experience is they laugh at your jokes more the richer you get. " <p> Mr. Lay was only the city 's latest kingmaker. A generation before, the leadership had been a close-knit group of financiers and businessmen known as the 8F Club because of their meeting place at a local hotel. These were the executives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and built the stadium of yesterday 's future : the Astrodome. <p> " Ken Lay came as close to being the 8F Club and having the room to himself as anybody I know, " said Rodney Ellis, a local state senator. <p> As Enron took the lead in the deregulation movement, the company showered millions of dollars on state and federal politicians in both parties whose support was critical in forcing open the energy markets. Foremost among the beneficiaries was George W. Bush, whose presidential campaign was taking public shape in early 2000. <p> As far back as February 1998, Mr. Lay was among the two dozen wealthy and influential Texas fund-raisers who gathered for a get-acquainted session with Mr. Bush on a 10,000-acre ranch outside the small town of Wheeler. Mr. Lay would later be considered among the most important of Mr. Bush 's financial supporters, along with Joe B. Allen, a partner at Vinson &; Elkins. They would be among the first of Mr. Bush 's " pioneers, " the fund-raisers who each raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Joe were some of the earliest supporters, and their support was crucial because they lined up others in Houston and Texas to give and to raise money, " said a longtime Republican strategist. He described how Houston 's political and fund-raising community adhered to the principle of " if I was going to help you with this political effort, or this charitable effort, you 'd be willing to help mine. " <p> If Houston does not rival New York or Los Angeles as a source of political dollars, it is still considered a big pot of riches, and one where nearly all the major corporations play the game. One prominent fund-raiser, Sue Walden, who in the last eight years has raised nearly $50 million from Enron and other energy companies, said elected officials often courted the companies to play host to $1,000-a-plate dinners at the Four Seasons Hotel. No one was in greater demand than Mr. Lay. <p> " Sometimes we would say Ken is overused and let 's not do any for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Vinson &; Elkins, political giving often seemed voluntary in name only. On June 15, 2000, Enron 's political action committee sent a memo to employees suggesting " voluntary " contributions for Enron employees, from $500 for a low-level manager to $5,000 for a top executive. The memo said the money would assist the company as it faced numerous legal and regulatory challenges and a variety of environmental and tax issues. <p> One Enron employee, a Democrat, said the company 's aggressive canvassing of employees helped explain why the company gave money to three-fourths of the senators and half of the House members for a total of more than $6 million since 1989. Enron and its political action committee contributed $113,800 to Mr. Bush 's presidential campaign. <p> " The request is given to you by the managing director, " the employee explained. " He encourages you to do it, knows if you 've done it. The higher you go, the more pressure there is to give. I think it 's distasteful. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Mr. Allen, one of three " pioneers " among the firm 's partners, led the political action committee. He is known at the firm for keeping careful track of the partners ' and associates ' contributions in what is called " the mystic book, " a fund-raising ledger that got its name from Mr. Allen 's predecessor, a man who had a ponytail and a tiny earring. <p> Joe Householder, a spokesman for the firm, said he was unaware of intense pressure brought to bear for contributions, noting that Mr. Allen " does n't like to talk about it in great detail. " As for the $202,850 that the firm gave to Mr. Bush 's campaign, an amount trailing only MBNA America, the credit card bank in Wilmington, Del., Mr. Householder said such support should not be considered surprising. <p> " There is a lot of hometown pride here, " he said, " and a lot of people in the firm thought he was a fine governor and he 'd make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political fund-raising was the cross-pollination of employees between Enron and its lawyers and accountants. One Enron vice president, who was laid off in December, said Andersen often had as many as 250 employees working inside Enron 's 50-story skyscraper. " They were involved in about everything there, " the vice president said. <p> This physical proximity was accentuated by the fact that so many Enron employees had once worked at Andersen ; at Mr. Skilling 's old firm, McKinsey ; and to a lesser degree at Vinson &; Elkins. Enron 's general counsel, James Derrick, had once been a Vinson &; Elkins partner. The company 's chief accounting officer, Richard A. Causey, had started at Andersen. <p> " I remember them saying that once you got to a certain level at Andersen, they would suggest you tried to get hired by a lot of clients like Enron, " the former Enron vice president said. " This would provide them with access to more accounting jobs. " <p> Well beyond Enron 's circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said M. Ray Perryman, an economic consultant. For self-conscious residents of this city, the nation 's fourth largest, Enron offered a new kind of thinking that had an innate appeal : it was an entrepreneurial, high-tech company of the future in a town eager to grow beyond the booms and busts of its oil industry past. If Houston business leaders loved the technology gloss that the hometown computer maker Compaq gave to the city, Enron was loved even more. <p> " Enron was a real symbol to the city of the best of what Houston wanted to be, " Mr. Perryman said. " It 's starting with the old, taking the new, and you 're building something huge and, seemingly, fantastic. " <p> The rise of Mr. Lay and his company, Mr. Perryman said, typified the changeable nature of power in Texas, where old money does not have the monopoly on influence, and even outsiders like the older George Bush and Kenneth Lay, who is from Missouri, can rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People, " he said, " do judge you more by your actions than by who your daddy was. " <p> Most Texans would argue that the intermingling of politics and business here is typical. One attorney for Vinson &; Elkins argued, " Do you think it 's any different from anything going on in L.A., or in Reagan 's crowd? Or in Clinton 's crowd? <p> " Folks are folks, " he said. <p> But the story does have a larger-than-life local flavor, said Paul Burka, the senior executive editor of Texas Monthly magazine. " Maybe it 's a classic Texas story, " he said, " to push things to the limit. " <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
