4195441 <p> CLEVELAND, Ohio - Many analysts think Texas A&amp;M defensive end Myles Garrett is a " no-brainer " pick for the Cleveland Browns, who hold the first selection in the 2017 NFL Draft on Thursday. <p> To which I say, " Have n't we seen enough brainless picks from the Boys from Berea? How about a full-capacity brain pick? " <p> Have n't we heard that no-brainer thing before? <p> Well, yes, in fact we did, for Braylon Edwards Scissorhands, in fact, No. 3 in the 2005 NFL Draft, but No. 1 in the heart of then captain of the Good Ship Full o ' Fools, Phil Savage. <p> " This is a no-brainer pick, " the Browns rookie general manager said at the time. " It 's the best player. You take your highlighter and say, ' We just got the No. 1 player in the draft. ' " <p> Edwards had one record-breaking season. He then began to react on game days as if allergic to all pork products, including pigskin. <p> The end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if such a thing existed, to Courtney Brown, the Browns ' pick as overall No. 1 in the draft in their second year back in the league. Brown was a defensive end from Penn State, known as the " Quiet Storm " who, even before being reduced greatly by injuries was sort of the " Brief Drizzle, " rarely demanding double-team blocking. <p> Still, Ohio State coach Urban Meyer, in whom I do believe, thinks the defensive end is typically the best player on defense, which was certainly true when he had Joey Bosa( passed over by the Browns, only to become the AFC Defensive Rookie of the Year) on his national championship team. <p> Given what a crap shoot quarterbacks are, and given that Johnny Manziel, my choice, sailed off on a swan boat with his reputation in tatters, I 'm going with the consensus pick, Garrett, even if he went to the same school as Johnny Gin Mill. <p> Defensive end is one of the premier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left tackle. <p> The QB pick <p> If there 's a quarterback the Browns like at No. 12 in the first round, when their next pick arrives, take him. <p> I would not trade up. <p> If Deshaun Watson is there, take him. <p> If not, Mitch Trubisky. <p> Trubisky <p> I 've been down the local yokel road with Brian Hoyer and also, in the more distant past, Charlie Frye. They press. They increase the burden on themselves because of the hometown angle. They 're overrated on geography, not ability. <p> Only Bernie Kosar beat the hometown hex, and he did n't last long at his peak. <p> There are problems with Trubisky, including only 13 games as a starter. Seriously, do you think North Carolina coaches intentionally did n't play the better quarterback? <p> Also, Trubisky, a graduate of Mentor High School, was n't blow-your-socks-off good against the handful of good teams he played. Florida State, against whom he played well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watson <p> Watson had two great games for the national championship against the best defense in college football, Alabama. <p> He is one of the biggest winners in college football history. <p> He also looks good in orange as a Clemson guy. <p> Does he have a weaker arm than Trubisky? Ask Ohio State. Watson made all the throws in dismantling the Buckeyes in the national semifinals. <p> Why go against the dominant player at the most important position in college? Do n't overthink it.
