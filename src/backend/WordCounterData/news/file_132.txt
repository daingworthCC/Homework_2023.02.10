3027441 <p> In May, daycare workers in Monticello, Ky., found bruises on Daniel Reynolds. <p> In June, doctors said the toddler 's broken right leg appeared to have been twisted until it snapped - and Daniel was put in foster care. <p> In August, with case workers ' consent, Daniel was sent back home with his stepfather and mother. <p> And in early December, police and prosecutors say, Daniel died from a fist to the side of his head. <p> " It makes you sick when you see this, " says prosecutor Robert Bertram, who has charged both parents and four case workers in the death of the 22-month-old. <p> Yet with sickening persistence, reports of child abuse and neglect pour in - about 3 million cases in 1993, says a report released today to USA TODAY by the National Committee for Prevention of Child Abuse, including 1,300 children abused and neglected to death. <p> Some of those deaths might have been prevented : Of every 10 children who died, at least four already were known to child protection workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes - only to be returned and abused again. <p> The nation 's child abuse crisis is as tangible as the welts on a beaten child, as vast as society 's capacity for violence. It thrives where children are born into the same poverty, addiction and abuse that cradled their parents. It thrives when underfunded agencies send overburdened case workers into wretched homes, to " save families " that may barely exist. <p> It is this cycle of abuse and neglect - the one-third of reports that cite " repeaters " who 've mistreated kids before - that sparks particular outrage. <p> " If I go and rape or beat up the kid next door, social workers do n't come out - cops come out, " says Patrick Murphy, whose Cook County( Ill.) Public Guardian 's office represents mistreated kids. " But if I rape my own daughter or beat up my own son, social workers come out and talk to me about my own parenting or how my mother dealt with me. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Association of Homes and Services for Children, says, " People are tired of reading about an innocent child being brutally beaten to death when the family was already involved in the child welfare system. <p> " You think, ' Protect that child. ' " <p> The alarming rate at which children are n't protected drives home both the intractability of the problem and the insufficiency of current efforts to treat it, experts say. <p> And the latest abuse figures may reflect only " half the number of cases that actually occur, " says Philip McClain of the Centers for Disease Control. " It 's a helluva bad problem. " <p> Changing battle plan <p> Since a 1962 study first identified " The Battered Child Syndrome, " the battle plan against abuse has changed repeatedly. <p> " In the late ' 70s, the social worker went in on a white horse and she took the child out, " says Baltimore Juvenile Court Judge David Mitchell, who sees hundreds of abuse cases every year. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contesting, " ' Who does speak for the child 's rights? ' " <p> By the ' 90s, he says, " we moved to a ' parents ' rights ' model, " with a premium placed on leaving kids with parents. <p> But that emphasis is fading, he says, as it becomes clearer " we may have insoluble problems with( some) parents. " <p> Whether it 's physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse or neglect, high-profile cases haunt the public memory. <p> The 19 Chicago children found in one squalid apartment. The Schoo girls, left " Home Alone " while their parents vacationed in Mexico. Lisa Steinberg of New York City, beaten by her adoptive father until she died at age 6 of brain injuries. <p> " That 's what the public is outraged over, " says NCPCA 's Joy Byers : " The fact that they seem to read the same stories over and over and over again. " <p> Families beyond help <p> In March 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Terry Jean Garcia-Ortiz of Minden, Nev. - who recently regained custody she had lost for biting one of her four children - charged with killing 4-year-old Letisia by repeatedly hitting her on the head with a glass baby bottle. <p> -- Donita Jo Artis of Pittsburgh sentenced to prison for beating her 3-year-old son Jason so severely that he was left blind, deaf and unable to walk. <p> -- Brittanny Whitlow, a 3-month-old Milwaukee girl, found dead of malnutrition and dehydration after her mother reportedly left her home alone over a weekend. <p> -- 4-year-old Shayna Bryant found beaten to death in her Bronx, N.Y., home, her body covered with burns and bruises. Charged : parents Orlando and Sherain Bryant - whom child-care officials had been investigating for seven years. <p> As abuse and neglect cases recur and multiply, police and social agencies pursue only the worst of the worst, says Susan Zuravin, an ex-Maryland social worker now studying abuse. <p> " By the time many families get through that threshold, they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God could n't come down here and do much with these families. " <p> However flawed the families, many social workers try to leave children at home - as a matter of policy and belief, and because they do n't have the resources to do otherwise. <p> But since the advent of crack cocaine in the mid-1980s, there 's been " an explosion " of kids placed in care outside their homes, says Nordlinger - up to about 500,000 this year. <p> Foster parents abuse much less often than parents re-abuse, studies show. But foster care is costly ; homes are hard to find, especially for troubled and minority kids ; and some experts say separation hurts more than leaving kids with parents. <p> With the aim of rehabilitating families while keeping kids at home, the federal government will spend nearly $ 1 billion over the next five years on intensive " family preservation " programs - one worker assigned to one family, as much as 30 hours a week for at least six weeks. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because " it 's the cheapest way to go. " Keeping a child at home instead of in foster care saves around $ 27,000 per case, the National Research Council estimates. <p> But the council finds only " equivocal evidence " that such programs work. A 1987 review of some intervention programs found that one-third of parents kept maltreating their kids while in the programs - and more than half were judged likely to resume abuse after the programs ended. <p> Understanding the impact <p> Though roughly a third of abuse reports concern families that have been cited before, many states ' record-keeping is so inadequate that these " repeaters " never get singled out. <p> The initial judgments on removing kids are made by case workers, hundreds of thousands nationwide. As a rule they 're underpaid, burdened with heavy caseloads, prone to burnout. <p> And they often land in no-win situations : accused of overreacting when they remove some kids, but slammed for inaction if they do n't remove kids who end up hurt or dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February, the worker who 'd been assigned to their case was fired.( The kids remain in foster care as the parents seek to regain custody.) <p> NCPCA director Anne Cohn Donnelly knows that when " people are outraged, they say, ' Reprimand the social worker! Jail the parents! ' " A better approach, she says, are programs that counsel potential abusers from the time kids are born, in hopes of " preventing mistreatment in the first place. " <p> A society that prefers to think of kids as resilient - little survivors who can bounce back from almost anything - " has not fully understood maltreatment 's major impact on kids ' lives, " says Cathy Spatz Widom of the University at Albany. <p> To gauge the effects, psychologist Widom studied about 1,100 childhood victims, now ages 23-33. Compared to those not abused, they have lower IQs ; less job success and more unemployment ; more failed marriages and suicide attempts. <p> " It really affects all spheres of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the ones that survive. " <p> A child left unprotected <p> When Daniel Reynolds died, " What broke my heart is that it could have been prevented, " says Alice Parmley, the daycare director who reported the boy 's injuries to the state. Despite complaints from her and from doctors, case workers said the boy could safely be sent home, court documents show. <p> Now Daniel 's stepfather, Bobby Parker, is charged with murder. Four case workers are charged with complicity to murder, as is Daniel 's mother Brandy Michelle Parker - who, two days after Daniel died, gave birth to another son. <p> " In the end, the issue is not, ' Did an agency screw up? ' " says child death expert Dr. Michael Durfee. " The issue is, ' Did a kid die, and did people fail to protect that kid? ' " <p> Child abuse deaths on the rise <p> Experts say that 43% of the children who die suffered at the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
