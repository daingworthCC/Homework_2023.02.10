3029041 <p> I t 's 63 years this month since pitcher Joe Cascarella won the first and only major league game played on the Chinese mainland. <p> Not that the game was a huge success. A team of barnstorming American Leaguers, including Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth, played a team of U.S. Marines and missionaries. <p> Only a few hundred braved a cold Shanghai mist to watch the 22-1 rout Dec. 6, 1934. The game did not cause baseball to take root in China, as it had in Japan and would in Taiwan. And Cascarella, a Philadelphia Athletics rookie and perhaps the least-known player on a team that included seven future Hall of Famers, did not go on to fame and fortune. <p> But the Chinese baseball game produced remarkable fallout. <p> A one-of-a-kind autographed baseball, given by the players to a Chinese fan and hidden away for more than a half century, has made its way to the Hall of Fame. As a direct result of the All-Stars ' visit, the Chinese-American softball leagues of San Francisco now have an umpire named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was handed down like the baseball from his father -- the Chinese fan of long ago. <p> And I have a tiny souvenir bat the players left behind, passed from an old Washington Senator to the Chinese fan to me in a 63-year relay. Collectors have told me it 's priceless, but its value ca n't compare with the rich friendships that came with it. In researching the Chinese baseball story, I got to know the fan, Li Bao-Jun, who died last July at 91, and Cascarella, the last living member of that barnstorming team. <p> " The ball is great, " says Ted Spencer, curator of the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. " But the story that comes with it is even better. " <p> The Shanghai game was added as almost an afterthought on the All-Stars ' ambitious touring schedule. They already had played and won 18 games in Japan and needed to make a refueling stop as their ship traveled to the Philippines. " Most of us just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cascarella recalled. <p> Lunch invitation <p> Enter Li Bao-Jun. Li, then 28, had been a catcher for <p> St. John 's Christian missionary college in Shanghai. He sent a note to the ship inviting players to lunch at a restaurant and a city tour with himself as guide. Earl Whitehill, a pitcher with the Washington Senators, his wife, Violet, and A 's trainer Doc Ebling showed up. <p> As thanks, they gave Li two tiny souvenir bats and a pair of balls autographed by the team : Ruth, Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Charlie Gehringer, Lefty Gomez, Earl Averill, Connie Mack and seven others. <p> The game is a blur. Ruth wore a sweater and hit three out. Moe Berg -- lawyer, linguist, World War II spy -- was the catcher. Cascarella 's overhand curveball was unhittable. The American Leaguers lent the Shanghai all-stars a couple of players. Shanghai scored. <p> Years later, what Li remembered best was batting practice -- Ruth 's long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullet speed. <p> " I 'd never seen a baseball hit like that, " Li said when we met in Shanghai at Christmas 1990. " It seemed not to be so real. " <p> Cascarella has a memory of Christian missionaries, some who had walked two and three days to reach Shanghai for the game, embracing the All-Stars at game 's end and weeping. <p> " I was embarrassed, " he says today. " I felt like I had n't done anything but pitch a ballgame, and they were acting like I was bringing them the sacraments. " <p> Hidden treasure <p> Half a century passed. China was invaded by Japan, then suffered a four-year civil war that brought Mao Tse-Tung and the Communists to power in 1949. Li married his college sweetheart and fathered three boys and three girls. He used the little bats to teach them baseball. When sporting goods became scarce, Li used one of the autographed balls to continue the baseball lessons. The other one he hid away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawer in the apartment he shared with family members. <p> That was a good thing. During the " Cultural Revolution " of 1966-76, rampaging youths called Red Guards stormed across the countryside seeking to weed out Western influences. They broke into Li 's house and smashed pictures taken at the pregame lunch he hosted. At age 65, Li was sentenced to four years digging rice in the countryside. <p> " Like all other elder intellectuals, I was sidelined during the years 1966 to 1976, " he wrote me, in the baseball vernacular he often used. <p> The Red Guards never found the ball. <p> Joe Cascarella, then 27, went home to Philadelphia and took an offseason job singing on the radio. That winter, he drew the notice of a young socialite, Gertrude " Jerry " Shapiro of Baltimore. They eloped during the 1936 All-Star break over the objections of Jerry 's father, who was certain, as Joe remembers it, that " ballplayers never amounted to anything. " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anniversary. <p> Career stopped short <p> Joe Cascarella blew out his right shoulder in the spring of 1935 and never lived up to the promise of that rookie season, when he won 12 games for an awful A 's team. He retired after the 1938 season and went to work with his brothers-in-law operating Maryland 's Laurel Race Course. Other than the odd lunch with Moe Berg, Cascarella had little to do with baseball. <p> " I felt like I had n't accomplished anything, " he recalled years later. <p> Fast forward to 1989. Li, working as a translator for the Shanghai sports institute, presented the long-hidden ball to a visiting American coach with instructions to take it to the Hall of Fame. As he neared the end of his life, Li believed that the ball that meant so much to him should be returned to its home. <p> The Hall doubted the ball 's authenticity. For one, Li did not remember the correct date of the game, making it hard to research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And, alerted by a wire story, I found a book in the National Baseball Archives that contained the game 's linescore. The home plate umpire, John Quinn, had kept a diary and published it once the tour had ended. <p> I began to correspond with Li. He sent me letters rich in detail about the game, his life and the history of western sports like baseball and basketball after they were transplanted to China. <p> He wrote of how he kept the memory of baseball alive among his children, using the surviving ball as a symbol of " friendship and what is best about sports. " On assignment in 1990 in Shanghai, I took Li a souvenir, a baseball signed by Cascarella and Gehringer, then the 1934 team 's two surviving members. <p> In return, he gave me the surviving souvenir bat, dyed brown by time, and a memorable image. <p> " I threw a ball across the ocean, " he said. " And you threw it back. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were regular correspondents until his death. And he did get to watch baseball again, in a way. In his mid-80s, the Chinese government hired Li to write narrations for major league highlights to be used in news programs. After 55 years, Li wrote, it was a joy to simply run the tapes and let baseball " wash over me. " <p> ' A true friend ' <p> Joe Cascarella is a different story. The 90-year-old right-hander has become a fast friend. We meet regularly for dinner, where the conversation leans toward history, politics, business -- but seldom baseball. However, he admitted to being tickled when Li, at my prompting, wrote him a fan letter 50-plus years after the Shanghai game. <p> Li 's son, Francis, emigrated to San Francisco in 1991. He works for the post office and umpires softball games. <p> The ball remains in Cooperstown, where it is insured for an undisclosed sum. It 's in remarkable shape, no doubt the result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Spencer says the ball is one of the best-preserved examples of signatures from its era. <p> The little bat is in my den, not far from the signed and framed publicity shot of Cascarella, warming up on the sideline in 1934. <p> The inscription reads : " Always a true friend. " But the last time we spoke, Joe indicated he was thinking of adding a postscript. <p> " How about ' He went 1-0 in China? ' " he said with a wink.
