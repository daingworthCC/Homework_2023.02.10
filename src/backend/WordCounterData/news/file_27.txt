3004341 <p> Judge Lance A. Ito, struggling to control intensive publicity about the O. J. Simpson murder case, asked three television broadcasters to delay interviews with the author of a new book about Nicole Brown Simpson. He also indicated that he planned to sequester the jury for at least part of the trial. <p> Responding to Judge Ito 's request, CBS News and Maury Povich, the host of a syndicated talk program, said they would exercise their First Amendment free speech rights and broadcast the interviews. A third network, CNN, said in a statement that " in light of the court 's fair concerns " it would delay broadcasting an interview between Larry King and the author of the book, Faye D. Resnick, a close friend of Mrs. Simpson <p> Later in the day, in an unscheduled courtroom session, Robert L. Shapiro, Mr. Simpson 's lead lawyer, asked Judge Ito to release his client on bail and delay his trial for at least a year because of the sensational publicity. <p> " This is an unprecedented case where greed, the desire for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has replaced the right to a fair trial, " Mr. Shapiro said. <p> Judge Ito denied the motion, saying a grant of bail is not an option for a person facing double murder charges. <p> In letters sent to the broadcasters on Tuesday and made public today, Judge Ito, who is presiding over the trial in Los Angeles County Superior Court, said, " I hope you will find it in your conscience, corporate and otherwise, to cooperate with this request and delay this program 's broadcast until after the jury in this case has been selected and sequestered. " <p> In her book, " Nicole Brown Simpson : The Private Diary of a Life Interrupted, " Ms. Resnick said she believed Mr. Simpson killed his former wife after stalking and threatening her for months. The book. published by Dove Books, was written with the assistance of Mike Walker, a columnist and senior editor for the tabloid National Enquirer. <p> Judge Ito suspended jury selection on Tuesday, telling potential jurors that Ms. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fair trial. He ordered the 80 people in the jury pool not to read newspapers or magazines, watch television or listen to the radio. He also told them to stay out of bookstores. <p> Judge Ito 's letters were addressed to Eric Ober, president of CBS News, Mr. Povich and Mr. King. A CBS News program, " Eye to Eye, " anchored by Connie Chung planned to broadcast an interview with Ms. Resnick on Thursday night. <p> Responding to Judge Ito, Mr. Ober said in a letter made public today that while the network " appreciates and respects your commitment to safeguarding Mr. Simpson 's Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial, we believe that broadcasting Ms. Chung 's interview with Ms. Resnick is fully consistent with responsible journalism. " <p> Ms. Chung is married to Mr. Povich. <p> Judge Ito 's letters were the latest of many instances in which he has wrestled with the issue of sequestering the jury in what is expected to be a long trial. Judges in high-profile cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be challenged because of exposure to news reports or to outsiders who might influence their judgment. <p> It was unclear from Judge Ito 's remarks, however, whether he intended to sequester the jury for the entire trial, part of the trial or during deliberations. And a court spokeswoman, who talked to the judge after the letters were made public, said a final decision had not been made. <p> " There are several types of sequestration, from partial to full, and the court has not decided to what extent jurors will be sequestered, " said the spokeswoman, Marcia Skolnick. <p> It is not known whether Ms. Resnick is among the list of potential witnesses in the trial, but in her book she said that Marcia Clark, the lead prosecutor, asked her in July to appear for the prosection. Publication of her book, however, is likely to taint her usefulness as a prosecution witness. <p> Lawyers for Mr. Simpson said in court documents today that the publication of Ms. Resnick 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial in progress. " <p> " If Faye D. Resnick were called as a witness in the trial, nearly all of her allegations would be excluded as unreliable hearsay evidence, or as simple irrelevant, " they continued. " Her credibility would have been seriously challenged by showing her motive to fabricate, her frequent use of cocaine and other drugs throughout the events she purports to describe, her bias, her pecuniary interest in profiting from the tragedy of Nicole Brown Simpson 's murder, and her elaborate efforts to avoid being interviewed by the defense. " <p> In her book, Ms. Resnick says " lawyers and friends " of Mr. Simpson made her the " target of bizarre gambits " in an effort to prevent her from testifying in the defendant 's trial. <p> Ms. Resnick acknowledges in the book that she has twice been admitted to the Betty Ford Clinic and was using drugs during most of the period she describes in her book when she was, in her words, Mrs. Simpson 's " best friend. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have produced an intriguing constitutional sideline to the Simpson murder trial and may ultimately break new ground on the limits a trial judge faces in controlling events in the courtroom. <p> The immediate issue is whether Mr. Simpson can get a fair trial if the interviews with Ms. Resnick are broadcast. The larger issue involves a criminal defendant 's Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial, decided on the basis of evidence presented in court, and the press 's First Amendment right to pursue vigorously and publish and broadcast freely all it defines as news. <p> The press and the courts have clashed over the two constitutional issues for years. News organizations and press advocacy groups have argued that, rather than barring the publishing or broadcasting of potentially prejudicial information, courts can insure fairness by delaying a trial, sequestering a jury or moving the trial to a city where jurors are less likely to have been tainted by pretrial revelations. <p> Judges, in turn, have said that in an age of nationwide broadcasts, delaying or moving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Judge Ito must resolve this impasse. <p> On the sequestration issue, lawyers for Mr. Simpson, while deploring the sensational publicity surrounding the trial, have argued vigorously against separating jurors from their friends and families and the rest of the world. <p> At one point in the pretrial hearings, Johnnie Cochran, one of Mr. Simpson 's lawyers, told Judge Ito that " a sequestered jury is almost like giving a defendant a year in the county jail. " <p> Judge Ito responded, " I think the food 's better. " <p> Mr. Cochran then said, " The food may be a little better, your honor, but the privileges are still somewhat constrained, and I think we should keep that in mind. " <p> Explaining its decision to honor Judge Ito 's request, CNN, specifically saying that it was " exercising its First Amendment right " by acting voluntarily, agreed to delay broadcasting two planned interviews. Mr. King had been scheduled to interview the book 's co-author, Mr. Walker, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ms. Resnick next Wednesday. <p> Steve Haworth, a spokesman for CNN, said on Tuesday that CNN executives decided to accede to Judge Ito 's request both because there was some shared concern about the interviews ' impact on prospective jurors and " because we are pursuing our own investigation into the book 's allegations. " <p> Mr. Ober said in his letter to Judge Ito that the contents of the book had already been widely publicized. Indeed, CBS itself led its evening newscast on Tuesday night with several disclosures from the book, and used some excerpts of Ms. Chung 's interview. <p> " We believe broadcasting Ms. Chung 's interview with Ms. Resnick is fully consistent with responsible journalism, " Mr. Ober wrote. <p> But executives from other networks said CBS has been struggling with its prime-time programs this year, with Ms. Chung 's program among the lowest rated on the network 's schedule. The interview is expected to give that program its highest rating of the year. <p> Mr. Haworth said that despite its decision to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to discuss the contents of the book in its news reports. " We have done extensive reporting on the allegations in the book, " he said. <p> He also denied that the network was influenced by a charge of contempt of court that the news network is fighting. That case concerns CNN 's broadcasting of a 1990 conversation between the former Panamanian leader, Manuel Noriega, and his lawyer in prison. A Federal district judge in Miami has yet to rule on the contempt charge. <p> Mr. Povich, who taped his hourlong nationally syndicated show with Ms. Resnick last Thursday, said he read his letter from Judge Ito on Tuesday morning, gave it " serious consideration " along with his producers and Paramount Television, which syndicates the program, throughout the morning, and decided by midafternoon not to change the scheduled broadcast. <p> " We decided to go ahead because of the widespread availability of the book, the huge media coverage the book has received and the other interviews she agreed to do, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anything else, we believe that when Judge Ito alerted and warned his potential jurors not to read the book, not to watch television and not to read newspapers and magazines, that he basically solved his own problem. " <p> He said his program did not pay Ms. Resnick for her appearance. Asked if there were First Amendment considerations in his decision, he replied, " There are, but I do n't think we have to hang our hats on that. "
