3025341 <p> Terry Anderson, the last American hostage held in Lebanon, walked free into a different Middle East than the land he disappeared from 2,455 days before. <p> Indeed, those differences are what brought freedom for Anderson and eight other hostages in the past five months. <p> When the hostage saga began in 1984, Beirut was a militia battleground. Now the militiamen have put away their weapons, and the city is struggling to recover from a 15-year civil war. <p> Iran, in the early 1980s, was exporting revolution and listening to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini brand the United States " the great Satan. " Now it finds that it needs Western technology - and Western good will - to recover from its long, devastating war with Iraq. <p> In 1984, Syria was trying desperately to build an arsenal of Soviet weapons to match Israel 's powerful arms. Today, Syria is cozying up to the West and is making tentative steps to talk peace with Israel. <p> Israel, anxious to retrieve seven missing servicemen in Lebanon, cooperated with U.N.-mediated efforts to free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed over the bodies of nine guerrillas, and allowed a deported Palestinian to return to the occupied territories. <p> In exchange, Israel received word that three missing men had died and the body of one of them, while the whereabouts or fates of three others remained unknown. <p> Through the hostage saga, the Americans, Britons, French and other Europeans held in dark rooms often got only hints of the Middle East 's tumult. <p> They knew Lebanon 's tangled militia wars too well - artillery fire was heard sometimes as a distant roar and at times explosions shuddered nearby. <p> But the larger events the hostages learned of only through occasional newspapers provided them by their captives and, in later years, through radio newscasts. <p> " Time stopped, " Anderson said a day after his release. " I 've been in a closet, so to speak, for seven years. " <p> Their captors were Iranian-backed fundamentalist Shiite Muslims. They hated the West, especially America, for its power and wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil. Now there was kidnapping, a new way to gain publicity for their cause, to hurt the Americans and Europeans. <p> Only now is the horror of the hostages ' captivity becoming known. American Alann Steen has permanent brain damage from being kicked in the head. Another American, Joseph Cicippio, suffered permanent effects from frostbite after being chained on a balcony. All the men have dental problems from lack of decent food and dental care. <p> Freed hostages have talked of their struggle to survive boredom and uncertainty. When they were allowed to be together, the hostages talked politics, prayed, invented games and fantasized about the future. <p> Jean-Paul Kauffman, a French former captive, tried to remember all the wine vintages he knew. Anderson made a rosary out of string and bits of paper. Thomas Sutherland, an agriculture professor, gave lectures on farming. <p> They were trapped in their cubicles, captives to turbulent events they may not have known of or understood. <p> In April 1986 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bomb Libya, the hostage holders announced they had killed Britons Phillip Padfield and Leigh Douglas and American Peter Kilburn. <p> President Reagan once said that as events kept shifting, the United States had to devise new methods for trying to free the hostages. <p> " Many times we have felt we were on the track and that we were almost going to be able to set a day when they would be free and then it would disappear in the sand, " he said. <p> Reagan had promised no deals with " terrorists. " But it turned out his administration was selling weapons to Iran and using the profits to supply guns to Nicaragua 's Contra rebels. <p> The resulting scandal threatened Reagan 's presidency and made any negotiations to free the hostages a political hot potato for years afterward. <p> The events that perhaps affected the hostages most happened far from their stuffy cells - Khomeini 's death on June 3, 1989, the collapse of Soviet power and the Gulf War against Iraq. <p> When Khomeini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Associated Press who was kidnapped on March 16, 1985, had already been a captive for 1,540 days. <p> He had become a father to a daughter born after his kidnap. He would not see her for 2 more years. His own father and an older brother had died of cancer. <p> With Khomeini dead, his radical backers lost out in a power struggle with more moderate leaders who saw they would have to stop alienating the West if they wanted to rebuild their country. <p> Late last month, with the last three American hostages still imprisoned, the United States agreed to free $ 278 million owed Iran from before Khomeini 's revolution in 1979. <p> Meanwhile, Syria, which holds sway over Lebanon with its 40,000 troops there, saw its hopes of gaining parity with Israel in weaponry disappear with the Soviet Union 's collapse and Moscow 's new friendship with America. <p> When the Gulf War followed Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait, once-radical Syria joined the American alliance. It, too, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost land as better through diplomacy than war. <p> Suddenly, the Lebanese hostage-holders and the men they kept in dark holes were an embarrassment, not an asset.
