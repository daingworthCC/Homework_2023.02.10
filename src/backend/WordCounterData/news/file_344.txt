3058541 <p> It was a long time coming, but former Cub Rick Sutcliffe finally found the right music for his 150th victory. <p> Sutcliffe had n't won for the Orioles since June 30, but after his last losss in New York, he went to a concert in New Jersey. A concert by good friend Bruce Springsteen. Sutcliffe once loaned The Boss $ 500,000 for a down payment on a home from another good friend, actor Mark Harmon. <p> Now the story goes to Tuesday in Baltimore, where Sutcliffe started for the Orioles. <p> " Instead of getting tight and mad, I think that was the first time I ever smiled on the mound, " Sutcliffe said. " I had to laugh at that. " <p> Sutcliffe beat the Tigers. <p> WATCH OUT : Boston is the slowest and least exciting team in baseball, but former Cub Billy Hatcher added some excitement when he stole home Monday. <p> " He 's not a great player, but he busts his tail, and around here that sticks out like a sore thumb, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stole with Tom Brunansky at bat. <p> " I thanked him for not swinging, " Hatcher said. " My head was on a tee. He could have knocked it off. " <p> SPACE CADET : Seattle 's Randy Johnson had a wild time of it against Milwaukee last week. In five innings, he allowed eight hits, eight runs and six walks, threw two wild pitches and hit a batter. <p> But he has an excuse. <p> Seems Johnson visited a record store in the afternoon and bought an Iron Butterfly album, listening to it in the afternoon. <p> " I started thinking I was three years old when that( record) came out and I guess I just never came back, " he said. <p> COMEBACK GONE : Brewers Teddy Higuera, trying to come back from rotator cuff surgery, will have to wait another year. Or maybe forever. <p> After five minor league rehabilitation starts, Higuera complained of neck and shoulder pain and was shut down for the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next year, since the Brewers are paying him more than $ 6 million for the next two years. <p> " I ca n't help the team this year, " he said. " It 's frustrating but I tried my best. I do n't think my career is over. " <p> LOOKING UP : The Indians have improved every month this season, from 8-15 in April to 11-16 in May, 12-15 in June and 13-13 in July. <p> They might not even finish last, which manager Mike Hargrove says would be a major improvement. <p> " When you 've been down where we are for as long as we have, moving up would mean a lot to anyone, " he said. <p> A NEW SPARK : The big purge in Detroit - which cost 43-year-employee Jim Campbell and Bo Schembechler their jobs - was called " the most disappointing thing that ever happened in my career " by manager Sparky Anderson. <p> There is talk that Anderson might be next, but at least he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I win or I win, " he said. " I am not in a position where I can be hurt. " <p> YANKEE TALK : It was just more than a week ago that the Yankees were talking about being in a pennant race. Then they were swept by the Blue Jays, prompting Randy Velarde to admit, " We 're going to need to reach into our hats and pull out a rabbit. " <p> Going into the weekend series, the Yankees had lost nine of 11, with Curt Young winning both those games. Young, a two-time castoff, was 3-0 in the Yankee rotation. <p> But reliever John Habyan suddenly was a bullpen flop. For the first time in more than three years, Habyan 's ERA has climbed over 3.00. " It 's killing me, " he said. " Mentally I 'm cooked. I 'm not a quitter, I 'm just trying to catch my breath. " <p> ROYAL RAMBLINGS : Gregg Jefferies has down so well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will probably stay there when Keith Miller returns from the disabled list. <p> When Jefferies was moved to the No. 1 slot, Wally Joyner was moved to No. 2. Joyner immediately went 12-for-27. <p> As for one-time phenom Tom Gordon, he will probably forever be a middle reliever. As a starter, Gordon is 24-32 with a 4.27 ERA, but as a reliever 19-13 with a 2.89. <p> In the first 108 games, George Brett had 109 hits, which means he needed 55 more in 54 games to reach 3,000. <p> A MOUTHFUL : Baltimore 's No. 1 draft pick of a year ago, Mark Smith, is a southern California kid. And he stuck a foot in his mouth when giving an interview with a Pasadena newspaper. <p> Smith said Class A Hagerstown, where he played, was " brutal and I think they just got electricity two years ago. The joke around here is that if you can find a girl with a full set of teeth, you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Smith said he was kidding. But the team took advantage, holding a dentist 's night. <p> Anyone with a receipt from a dentist got in free, those with dentures got in for half price, and those with a full set of teeth got half-price concessions. <p> QUOTES DU JOUR : Milwaukee 's Chris Bosio, who has walked only one batter in his last 62 innings, on his theory of pitching : " Throw it over the plate and take your chances. It makes the guys behind you know they 're not going to be on their heels. It keeps them ready. I do n't like three hour games any more than anybody else. " Indians ' Jack Armstrong, now in the bullpen, on his problems in the rotation : " I was over-processing as a starter. " Mariners hitting coach Gene Clines, on the league 's No. 1 hitter Edgar Martinez : " He 's probably the best kept secret in the American League, but people are starting to realize who Edgar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for real. " <p> NOTES : On departing Comiskey Park, Twins Kirby Puckett and Kent Hrbek had only one home run between them since June 28. That was Hrbek 's. Last season, Puckett had 11 homers in the first half, four in the second. In their first 21 games after the All-Star break, the Rangers scored 65 runs and had one or no runs in seven games. Their record in those games was 7-14. The Indians ' Charles Nagy did n't lose back-back games in the first half, then started the second half 0-3. Toronto starters Juan Guzman, David Wells and Todd Stottlemyre, in the three-game series at Boston, allowed 18 runs in 12 innings. The Tigers were swept in seven games at Camden Yards, hitting just.192 and being outscored 45-13. Detroit shortstop Alan Trammell wo n't be back until Sept. 1 and might not be back at all. He broke his right ankle May 15.
