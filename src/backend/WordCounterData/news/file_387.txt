3066141 <p> IT may seem early to start talking about City Council races, but prospective candidates can start raising money next month, and they 're already lining up for the five seats that will be open. <p> Forbidden by city term limits from running again are council members Ada Edwards of District D, which includes the Third Ward and Montrose ; Addie Wiseman of District E, which consists mostly of Kingwood and Clear Lake ; Carol Alvarado of District I, which encompasses downtown and East End neighborhoods ; and Michael Berry, who holds at-large Position 5. <p> The Position 3 at-large seat is vacant since Shelley Sekula-Gibbs resigned in November for a brief stint in the U.S. House. She would have been term-limited had she kept the council seat. Here 's how things are shaping up based on interviews with candidates and others plugged into the city political scene : <p> No shortage of interest <p> The prospective lineup for District D includes developer Gerald Womack, whom Edwards beat in 2001 after a heated campaign. <p> Also looking at that race are the Rev. Michael Patrick Williams, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real estate agent ; Wanda Adams, a city employee ; and Lawrence Allen Jr., director of special projects for the Houston Independent School District. He is a state Board of Education member and son of state Rep. Alma Allen, D-Houston. <p> So far, the District E race is a Kingwood-versus-Clear Lake fight between Annette Dwyer, who lives in Clear Lake and is on Wiseman 's citizens advisory committee, and Humble school board member Michael Sullivan. A narrow strip of incorporated area connects the far-flung suburban communities on Houston 's northeast and southeast. <p> Alvarado 's former chief of staff, James Rodriguez, announced his intentions to run for the District I seat late last year, as many expected - making it clear to others who may be interested that they 'll face a long and expensive race. He spent the past year working for an engineering company. Union leader John Marron, a retired Southwestern Bell employee, also has expressed interest in running. <p> The race to succeed Sekula-Gibbs is complicated by the possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the November election for the term that begins in January 2008. Mayor Bill White is seeking a change in state law that would let the city wait until November 's regular election to fill the seat, avoiding the cost of a special election required in May to fill the final six months of the term. <p> However that shakes out, prospective candidates include Melissa Noriega, wife of state Rep. Rick Noriega ; retired Air Force officer Roy Morales, who ran for an at-large position in 2005 ; Andy Neill, a business consultant ; Noel Freeman, a city employee ; and Tom Reiser, a businessman who used almost $1.2 million from his own pocket in a losing 2002 congressional race and who said he is about " 75 percent committed " to the council race. <p> As for the at-large seat Berry is leaving, the only candidate so far floating an interest in running is lawyer, civic leader and former Kemah Mayor Bill King, who has moved to Houston with an eye on the 2009 mayor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King 's interest in a council seat is transparent. <p> While a citywide race would give him name identification and possibly a council seat, the steppingstone strategy will be scrutinized. <p> On one hand, individual council members, especially under White, typically do n't have much power or visibility. <p> While White leads by consensus, that leaves little room for public dissent on council because members like to remain in the good graces of a popular mayor. Of late, council members have n't been able to make a name for themselves, unlike the raucous years of Lee Brown 's administration. <p> As a private citizen, King can talk in theory about a variety of issues ; if he 's on the council he 'll have to take votes and create a record. <p> Remember, no council member has successfully made the jump to the mayor 's seat since Jim McConn in the late 1970s, and several have tried. <p> A time to grow <p> On the other hand, as a council member King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more credentials, sit through two budget cycles and have the opportunity to get to know neighborhoods and civic association presidents. <p> A council term also might give King a leg up with the money crowd since donors tend to contribute to incumbent officeholders. For someone with personal wealth - King has said he 's willing to spend $1 million of his own money in a mayoral race - the key is keeping money out of the hands of his opponents. <p> King told the Chronicle last fall, " if I 'm not the mayor of Houston, my life will still be complete, " quickly adding, " No other office has the slightest interest to me. " <p> Seems he 's already had a change of heart, or at least he 's using one seat as a means to an end. At 55, King has retired as the managing partner of Linebarger Goggan Blair &; Sampson, a firm that collects delinquent taxes for the city of Houston, Harris County, the Houston Independent School District and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract as a consultant to the firm until June 2008. That puts a wrinkle in his plans because it presents a potential conflict of interest. <p> There 's no perfect path to the mayor 's seat. But if your end game is well-known, then every move will be viewed in that context. <p> King has to be careful that he does n't wear people out long before they really care about the race. <p> NOTES : kristen.mack@chron.com
