3033741 <p> Separated at birth. That 's long been the motto of this wickedly surreal place. This rich land where life is cheaper than labor, where evil hangs thick and palpable in the air, multicolored and infinitely dimensioned. Sometimes it whispers, sometimes it shouts. There are so many forces, so many uniforms, so many weapons, so many rifts. <p> Here is the ultimate system of affirmative action, where most whites -- unless their minds or their karmas are incredibly impaired -- thrive. And where most blacks are lucky merely to survive. <p> Black South Africans have always fought the system. They 're also fighting each other these days too. " Tribal warfare " is often the simple explanation cited for such suicidal divisiveness on the eve of South Africa 's first democratic elections next week and amid such hope for national unity. But the simple answer is nearly always the wrong one in this land. <p> This is a country of contradictions. Of dazzling beauty and incalculable squalor. Of dizzying plenty and dire need. Where privilege and pain are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, to speed along a smooth superhighway that any Californian would envy, and spot at one turn a squatter camp where desperately poor blacks are concentrated, and be confronted on the next stretch of road by a huge billboard advocating animal rights. <p> It 's also a place where a drugstore hires a half-dozen black workers to stand shoulder to shoulder in an aisle, their only duty seeming to be precisely aligning -- not stocking, but making minute adjustments -- goods that are already on the shelf. <p> Where, at other times, things seem so deceptively normal that rounding a bend to encounter an armored vehicle designed and deployed for race wars gives a fright, followed by the bone-chilling realization that this is normal here. <p> South Africa -- more of a twilight zone than a 20th-century state. <p> It was a medical breakthrough that first brought this country into the consciousness of many Westerners in 1967 in the person of Christiaan Barnard, a white South African surgeon who performed the world 's first successful human heart transplant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Now, another groundbreaking operation is about to be performed on this soil. This time, however, the surgeon is an African American -- Benjamin Carson, head of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore -- who is preparing to separate black South African twin girls who were born six months ago in the Northern Transvaal joined at the back of their heads and sharing the same vascular drainage system. <p> Carson plans to use hypothermia -- lowering the babies ' body temperatures -- while attempting the delicate procedure, which has been performed only once before with this technique. That was in 1987, when Carson separated 7-month-old German-born twin boys at Hopkins. <p> The surgeon arrived Sunday, ready to make medical history, bestowing independent existence to the twins in tandem with the freeing of their country. But, alas, things often do n't go as planned in this place. And the twins -- Nthabiseng and Mahlatse Makwaeba -- have contracted chickenpox. <p> " The operation has been postponed by fate to take place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, chief neurosurgeon at the Medical University of Southern Africa, who together with Carson will lead a team of 40 doctors when the 22-hour operation is rescheduled. <p> When Barnard performed the first heart transplant nearly 30 years ago, it was a terrific feat for this backwater nation that aspired desperately to First World status. It reflected excellence and enlightenment that many hoped would overshadow outdated hallmarks of the Afrikaner regime, such as the well-known wartime sympathies for the Third Reich held by some of South Africa 's foremost leaders. Celebration of the medical marvel did not, however, advertise the details of apartheid, or how that system of modern slave labor bankrolled its scientific breakthroughs. <p> Then, as now, health care for the masses of black South Africans was abysmal. <p> Winnie Mandela, an African National Congress candidate for parliament, pounded the health care issue home Saturday while campaigning in the Botleng township, the black area at the outskirts of a small white town called Delmas in the Eastern Transvaal. Its shantytown is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contain 7 million blacks. They sprouted up over the years as whites pushed blacks off farmland and grazing plains, forcing them to live in small designated areas. <p> Since September, Mandela says, 19 people have died of typhoid fever in Botleng 's shantytown, which has no running water or sanitation system. <p> " In the 20th century, in a highly industrialized country, we have all the facilities to combat such fatal diseases, " she says. " This is one of the biggest crimes of apartheid -- the poor health conditions for the majority of the country.... We die daily, not only from violence, but from treatable social illnesses that are a legacy of our poverty. " <p> Drawn by big signs announcing a closing sale, a white woman pauses in front of the Guy Laroche boutique in Roseland, a sparkling conglomeration of shops to the north of Johannesburg that resembles Washington 's Mazza Gallerie in its more fantastic formative years. The owner of the shop, like so many whites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to England. <p> Inside the door, a young black woman wearing cheap-looking, ill-fitting clothes receives a nod from the manager to push a button that disarms the electronic lock on the shop 's discreetly solid iron gate. <p> The white woman enters. She is monied and matronly. Her features are as coarse as her skin is pale and powdered. She is also beefy, as are many Afrikaner women here. She browses briefly through a rack of drastically marked-down Parisian designs before realizing they are much too small for her frame. Then she heads for a display of Fendi handbags that are also reduced. She chooses one and heads for the cash register, where the manager is installed. There, the matron opens her new bag to examine its insides and shrieks when she discovers it has no organizing pockets, snaps or zippers. <p> " Oh, everything will end up lost at the bottom, " she says distressfully. <p> " Well, one must simply learn to cope with these things, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss her imminent retirement, as well as what other whites they know are going to do after the denouement, after South Africa 's first " all-race " elections are held next week. <p> As they talk, the young black clerk 's face is inscrutable. They talk as if the changes to come have nothing to do with her. Even though the New South Africa, as it is often called, will restore power to her people. For the first time since its founding in 1910, the country 's government will be chosen by a mixture of its blacks, so-called coloreds and Asians, who together constitute 87 percent of the population. And for the first time since European colonialists began to settle here nearly 350 years ago, whites have agreed to submit to majority rule. From now on, the 13 percent of South Africa that is white must learn to share. Or leave. Or so it appears. <p> This blood-soaked soil is accustomed to alternatives to justice. It is used to unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Take Cold Warrior Henry Kissinger, who brought a distinguished delegation to Johannesburg last week to broker an agreement among the warring Inkatha Freedom Party( IFP), the African National Congress( ANC) and Fredrik W. de Klerk 's lame-duck government. Within 48 hours of arriving, Kissinger was out of here, out of Africa and out of touch. He had done what he could, which was nothing in this intractable situation. <p> Despite Kissinger 's bargaining efforts, the IFP, a party dominated by Zulus, South Africa 's largest ethnic group, remains the biggest threat to peace at the polls next week. It is attempting to deny legitimacy to the elections by refusing to participate in them, hopefully holding out instead for constitutional changes that would grant Zulus permanent control over land in the Natal region, where the IFP is based. <p> In its latest protest against the election, the IFP 's Youth Brigade is threatening to march through the streets of Johannesburg this week to create a work stoppage. In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence and is preparing to encircle parts of the city with the razor-sharp type of barbed wire that is liberally used here to draw lines between colors, classes and politics. <p> On March 28, the last time the IFP marched in downtown Johannesburg, 58 people died. Power struggles between the IFP and the ANC, which is dominated by Xhosa people, are blamed for the violence. But the de Klerk government is widely believed to instigate a fair amount of the strife behind the scenes, and is known to have provided funds in the past to the IFP. These unseen government powers are referred to ominously as the Third Force. <p> Meanwhile, TV is broadcasting " Donahue " -type talk shows that pit members of right-wing white groups with names such as Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging( which when referred to by its acronym, AWB, brings to the minds of American boomer journalists, of whom there are thousands here, the Average White Band) against members of left-leaning black groups such as the Pan-Africanist Congress( PAC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their land, while the whites say things like, " If it were n't for us, you 'd still be running around the veld half-naked. " <p> That 's at night. It 's advisable to have coffee before attempting to take in earlier fare, such as " Good Morning South Africa, " which is stunningly cheerful and often mindlessly muddled as it flashes set after set of anchors who vary by sex, race, ethnicity and tongue. Sometimes they follow one another, reading the same segment of news to viewers in different languages, and other times they carry on conversations with each other while speaking different languages. Which perhaps partly explains why people are at loggerheads here. <p> You can also find Zinzi Mandela -- daughter of ANC leader Nelson Mandela, who served 27 years as a political prisoner here during the worst years of apartheid -- judging a body-building contest of mostly white men. Another shot is of an actor in a new production of the play " Sophiatown " being staged here making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to laugh again in this country. When somebody laughs, everyone turns and says as if scolding, ' He 's laughing! ' We are people. Laughter is important. " <p> Yet it 's hard. <p> During the prime-time televised debate here Thursday between de Klerk and Mandela, which the South African media proclaimed to be " American-style, " each candidate seemed to give nearly as good as he got. Mandela, who was an amateur boxer in his youth and who is fully expected to be elected president of the new government, may have had a slight edge to his jab, however. More important, as de Klerk as much as admitted, Mandela has justice on his side. <p> The studio audience seemed shocked into silence when de Klerk said : " We wo n't have peace before we have real reconciliation. This election is about the future ; it is not about the past. And until we bury the bitterness of the past -- " <p> He stopped abruptly, as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was asking. <p> " One can never forget injustice, " de Klerk continued, backing down a bit. " But you can forgive. And we need forgiveness. "
