4190441 have a contract with Verizon for a phone and DirecTV. It has been charging me for a phone since March 16, but I 've had no phone service since then. <p> To make matters worse, it is charging me $4.25 a month for a non-published number. <p> I called numerous times, and it also has my name misspelled. <p> Now most of my mail is in my new name. <p> I 'm 83 years old and I would like to have my phone before I die. Any help would be appreciated. J.T. <p> Dear J.T. I 've called Verizon on your behalf. Let 's see if I have any better luck than you have had. <p> But let me say one thing to everyone who writes to me for help : You have to send me details, especially phone numbers of the people you 've been dealing with and account numbers. <p> In your case, I ca n't call you because you have no phone. But it becomes much harder to get results when I have to start from scratch. <p> Anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our motto. <p> Dear Readers : Your letters to John Crudele are streaming in fast and furiously, asking Dear John to right the wrongs you 're facing.
