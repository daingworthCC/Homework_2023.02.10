3038341 <p> Troubled ABC is through trying to be NBC Lite and will instead focus on family sitcoms from 8 to 9 p.m., Monday through Friday. <p> The Disney-owned network, which plunged this season to third place( fourth place in its target young-adult demographic), will add seven new series to a fall schedule that is noticeably " Who Wants to Be a Millionaire " -less. <p> Also out are urban, childless sitcoms -- NBC-esque stuff that ABC developed for several seasons, such as " Dharma &; Greg " and " Spin City. " <p> In are " lighthearted " family sitcoms like a new John Ritter comedy, " 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter, " leading into the return of " According to Jim " on Tuesdays, and the return of " My Wife and Kids, " with Damon Wayans, " The George Lopez Show " on Wednesdays, plus shows such as " Dinotopia, " based on the miniseries, on Thursdays and " America 's Funniest Home Videos " on Fridays. <p> All will air between 8 and 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABC Happy Hour. <p> " Millionaire, " the game show that shot ABC to first place before it collapsed, along with the network 's ratings, will be back only occasionally as a stunt that will air for a few consecutive nights, then go away. That 's the same format in which it was launched in 1999. <p> " The core goal is to stop the downward trend in our ratings, " ABC Entertainment President Susan Lyne told reporters today at a news conference held at the ungodly hour of 8:30 a.m., before the network 's " upfront " presentation of its new fall schedule to advertisers. <p> " We need to stabilize and move the needle a little upwards. Nobody is expecting us to jump into first place next year, " acknowledged the refreshingly candid Lyne. <p> She pleaded with reporters to hold off on calling a show a flop if it does not open to big numbers. " Advertisers are much more patient than the press, " Lyne chided. <p> So desperate is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay them to watch one of its new shows, Thursday night 's " Push, Nevada. " The show, from Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, is about an FBI agent who investigates the theft of a whole lot of money from a casino in the strange town of Push. Over six weeks, viewers will be given clues and the first to solve the case will win the " missing " money. <p> According to Lyne, test audiences paid more attention because of the game element. Imagine how many more young viewers would watch Ted Koppel if ABC only offered a watch-and-win incentive. Why, he 'd cream Letterman -- maybe even Leno. <p> By the way, Koppel showed up at ABC 's presentation this afternoon at the New Amsterdam Theatre to tell advertisers that his show 's new motto is " More Relevant Than Ever. " He kidded that when he went to the Middle East recently, Yasser Arafat told him he was sending " one of his kids here " to do a show to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is replacing Bill Maher in the post-Koppel time slot, had taken the stage ages ahead of Koppel and begged advertisers, " Do not breathe a word of this to anyone " lest the " Nightline " anchor find out about the deal and try to squash it, as Koppel had done with ABC 's campaign to get David Letterman. <p> Kimmel, now host of Comedy Central 's " The Man Show, " promised advertisers that his ABC show would be much more ad-friendly, though he predicted he 'd get Barbara Walters onto a trampoline. <p> ABC will debut Kimmel 's show in the best time slot in all of television -- immediately after the Super Bowl on Jan. 24. Until then, ABC announced today, it will air the half-hour " Nightline Close Up, " anchored by Koppel and Chris Bury. Each broadcast will look at a compelling personality. <p> After football is over in January, ABC will air a Dick Wolf-produced remake of " Dragnet " on Monday nights, Lyne announced. <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save the network? " Kimmel asked. <p> Beige is the new black. <p> WB, the too-hip-to-live network, has decreed it. <p> WB unveiled its programming lineup to advertisers this morning. It included a new post- " 7th Heaven " drama that had even the most cynical ad execs wiping tears from their eyes, a totally overhauled Thursday that starts with a remake of " Family Affair, " an all-sitcom Friday that looks just like ABC 's old " TGIF " lineup, and an expanded Sunday filled with drama reruns. <p> But the most impressive thing about WB 's presentation was its beigeness. <p> WB dressed every single show star and even its executives in coordinated beigy, taupy, ecru outfits. <p> Imagine the embarrassment of the hundreds of ad execs who attended, dressed in the old black -- black. Right now hundreds of ad campaigns are no doubt getting emergency makeovers, in beige. <p> " Everwood, " WB 's new Monday drama, appears to be ad execs ' fave new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual eavesdropping on female ad execs who were waiting in lines in bathrooms after the NBC, WB and ABC presentations. The other networks have yet to unveil their new programs. <p> " Everwood " stars Treat Williams as a famous brain surgeon who is too busy saving lives in Manhattan to spend time with his family until his wife is killed. He decides to move his two kids to Evergreen, Colo., which has mysteriously been renamed Everwood for reasons that are never explained. <p> WB 's new schedule looks very much like the old ABC schedules, with family programming skewing young in early prime time each night, including the " Family Affair " remake, starring a pudgy Tim Curry as the very English butler. <p> Curry, wearing a beige suit, told advertisers that he had not seen the original and was " resisting " doing so, but nonetheless thinks he 's perfectly cast because he 's a Brit, he has " impeccable " taste and " small children annoy me immensely. " <p> Actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world, ABC and WB are each doing a show for fall about a guy in his thirties whose life is totally messed up because of high school. That 's right, two really pathetic guys on TV -- what are the odds? Anyway, in each case the guy is given the opportunity to travel back in time to the ' 80s and fix his high school years. ABC 's version is a Friday drama series called " That Was Then, " and WB 's is a Thursday sitcom called " Do Over. " <p> WB also will attempt to clone the success of this season 's drama on Superman 's early years, " Smallville, " with a new series called " Birds of Prey, " which stars a now-paraplegic Batgirl, who partners with the love child of Batman and Catwoman. <p> CBS will announce its schedule Wednesday morning at a media breakfast at Black Rock. CBS is the best at keeping its schedules under wraps until network CEO Les Moonves gives the go-ahead. That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who confirms a time slot to anyone outside the network. That 's according to staffers. <p> But the network does have to let the studios know ahead of time that their shows have been picked up, so that the stars can hop on a plane in time for CBS 's presentation this afternoon at Carnegie Hall. Those calls went out today. <p> Jerry Bruckheimer, executive producer of CBS 's hit drama " CSI, " has a sure thing in " CSI : Miami, " given that it actually had its debut last week as an episode of " CSI " and scored the show 's second largest audience this season. David Caruso, the luckiest guy in Hollywood, gets another whack at stardom as headliner of this one. Sources say CBS also has ordered Bruckheimer 's " Without a Trace, " which is about missing persons. <p> They also report that the thumbs-up went to " Hack, " starring David Morse as a crime-fighting taxi driver. And doc drama " Presidio Med " starring Dana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on the schedule. <p> " Queens Supreme " is considered a lock since executive producer Julia Roberts actually showed up at the William Morris " upfront " party at 21 Club on Monday night. It 's a comedy-drama about court justices in Queens, N.Y. <p> There 'll be another blue-collar comedy on CBS 's fall schedule, sources say, called " Still Standing, " as well as a comedy about a woman who gets to know her writer dad, played by Alfred Molina.
