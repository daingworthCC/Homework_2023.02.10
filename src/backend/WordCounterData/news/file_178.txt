3034341 <p> The Dodge Durango was the first big hint. He won the car for his improbable selection, at age 38, as the most valuable player at this year 's all-star game. He said he had won close to 17 cars during his career, and he had given every one of them away to family and friends. But this one he was keeping, because he wanted it as a souvenir. <p> The sticks were a hint, too. Everywhere he went this season, he 'd sign a few extra sticks, just to make sure the people he knew in that city would have something to remember him by. Looking back it all makes sense, but it was hard to see then, almost impossible, really. <p> Who could have imagined Wayne Gretzky was actually going to retire? <p> Even now, as Gretzky prepares to play his final game Sunday afternoon at Madison Square Garden, it is hard to believe. For the past 20 NHL seasons, you could always count on No. 99, gliding along with that crooked grin. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acrobatics with the puck, and then just when you thought he 'd transfixed you, he 'd disappear. By the time you found him again, the goal horn would be ringing in your ears. <p> This time, when he ducks out of sight, he wo n't be back. " The next time you see me skating will be with my kids, " he said. <p> " Of course I 'm sad. I 've played hockey for 35 years -- since I was three years old I 've been playing hockey. Then all of the sudden, it 's give me your skates, you 're done. I hate the fact that I have to retire. But I know I 've made the right decision. " <p> He 's been thinking about this moment for months. He almost announced his retirement in February, when the Rangers played in Edmonton, but his wife, Janet, convinced him to wait. He is at peace with the decision, he said. He is waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " There 's going to be an enormous hole, " Rangers winger Kevin Stevens said. " It 's a hole no one person can fill. It 's going to be empty. " <p> It rained the day Gretzky announced he was retiring. The sports news Friday already was distressing : Yankee Darryl Strawberry had been charged with cocaine possession and soliciting a prostitute, Dallas Cowboy Leon Lett failed another drug test and the Los Angeles Lakers waived Dennis Rodman because he had broken yet another team rule. And then came the official word that Gretzky was leaving ; one of the good guys was slipping out the back door. <p> Perhaps it 's hard to imagine hockey without Gretzky because he 's been a part of the sport for so long. He 's no longer at the top of his game -- that passed maybe as long as six years ago when he took the Los Angeles Kings to the Stanley Cup finals. But he has played professionally for 21 years( one year in the now-defunct World Hockey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forefront of the sport for more than 30. <p> When he was just 8 years old, he made headlines across Canada for scoring 104 goals in 62 games of pee-wee hockey. At age 10, he had 378 goals in 82 games. And it was n't just the numbers. Even then, people knew. The kid saw holes and plays that men decades older missed. <p> " I heard about Wayne when I was in the minors " in the late 1960s, said Rangers Coach John Muckler, who had met Gretzky 's parents years earlier. " My mother would call me and tell me about this kid from Brantford, how good he played. She did n't know how right she was. " <p> The only concern about Gretzky was his size. Although he eventually grew to 6 feet tall, he has remained slight and almost delicate. In a sport where men regularly take out their teeth to play and the hits they deliver can break the glass that surrounds them, many thought Gretzky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. At the age of 17, his year in Edmonton 's WHA franchise was so dazzling it was one of the main reasons the NHL absorbed the struggling league. He introduced himself to the NHL the next year by winning the Hart trophy as the league 's most valuable player. He 'd go on to win 10 scoring titles and nine Hart trophies and set 61 major NHL records. He even won four Lady Byng trophies, awarded for gentlemanly play. <p> But it is the four Stanley Cups Gretzky won in Edmonton that he will be best remembered by, even to himself. <p> " When you make it, there 's no feeling like lifting that Stanley Cup, " he said. " It 's the greatest thrill in the world. I guess it 's like your first-born child. You always remember it like it was yesterday. It 's very clear in your mind. " <p> The Edmonton years were heady times. The style of play was open and the game was Gretzky 's. He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in 1985-86 he racked up 163 assists. But just when it looked like nothing could stop a team that also included Mark Messier and Jari Kurri, Gretzky was traded to Los Angeles for cash, some players and a handful of draft picks on Aug. 9, 1988. <p> He cried, even though he had promised Messier he would n't. Canada cried as well, but his home country 's loss was the gain of the United States and eventually the NHL as Gretzky brought ice to the Sun Belt. By the early ' 90s, the Kings had supplanted the NBA Lakers as Los Angeles ' team to watch, with celebrity neophytes and hard-core hockey fans mixing to create an electric atmosphere. <p> " I think his years in Los Angeles exposed the American people to hockey, " Rangers forward John MacLean said. " He transcends the game, which no one before him could do. When he was in L.A. and with the TV exposure there, whether you knew anything about hockey or not, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major influence on expansion, especially on markets such as Nashville, Florida and Anaheim. " <p> Gretzky 's greatest moment with Los Angeles was in 1993, when the Kings played the Toronto Maple Leafs in the Western Conference finals. Scoring a hat trick in Game 7 of that series, Gretzky simply willed them ahead. The Kings lost the Stanley Cup to Montreal that year, and in 1996 the Kings lost Gretzky to St. Louis, choosing to trade him for some value before he became a free agent the following summer. <p> When Gretzky finally had his pick of teams a few months later, he chose New York. He never won a Cup here -- the closest he came was in 1996, when the Rangers lost the Eastern Conference finals to Philadelphia -- but he seemed rejuvenated by the life of the city and the raucous crowds. <p> That was three years ago. Since that shining performance in 1996, the Rangers have failed to qualify for the playoffs. This year, the whisper wondering when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he missed 11 games in February and March with a neck injury, New York actually played better without him in the lineup, the questions surfaced louder. But despite growing evidence that his 38-year-old body was acting its age, no one actually thought he 'd leave. <p> He had looked so sharp in January at the All-Star Game, after all, playing one shift toward the end of the game as if the laws of gravity were his to command. After that performance, Muckler thought Gretzky definitely would stay another year. Even if he had decided to keep the Durango. <p> " I do n't think he 's thinking about retiring, " Muckler said at the time. " I just think it was important for him to go down there and let people know he is still one of the best in the world. And he is. " <p> Muckler was speaking in the lounge outside the Rangers ' locker room, where a few minutes earlier Gretzky was asked where he fit into the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke into the NHL he told people he 'd retire by the age of 30, because " 30 is old. " <p> " When you get to 30, you realize it 's not quite that ancient, " he said, laughing. " In a lot of ways I wish I was Teemu Selanne and Eric Lindros and Paul Kariya right now, with 15 years of fun ahead of them. The other side of it is that I wish I could play in an era now like I did in the ' 80s, where it was more wide open. Then you could really see how the 38-year-old version of me would rate. <p> " But I do n't regret anything. I 've had such a good time. I love playing the game every day, and no matter what happens I 'll still love it. Always. " <p> Someone then asked Gretzky what he considered old these days. He dropped another hint, although of course no one was listening. <p> " Thirty-nine, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gretzky prepares to play his final game today. " Of course I 'm sad.... I hate the fact that I have to retire. But I know I 've made the right decision. " Wayne Gretzky, with Rangers assistant coach Keith Acton, left, will be best remembered for the four Stanley Cups he won with the Edmonton Oilers.
