5024941 <h> Case Keenum knows he has a short leash as Washington 's starting quarterback <p> The life of a journeyman quarterback is n't always easy. A constant QB-carousel keeps you on the move, and diminished expectations can often lead to luke-warm receptions from fanbases. <p> For Case Keenum, who was recently named the starting quarterback in Washington, it has been a modest reception, to say the least. Many in the fan base want rookie QB Dwayne Haskins to lead the team, even though he is young and inexperienced. Others want Colt McCoy to be the guy, but until he is completely healthy, that wo n't happen. <p> That leaves Keenum, who is playing for his third franchise in as many years. His stock rose to an all-time high in 2017 when he led the Minnesota Vikings to the NFC Championship, but it has gradually fallen after a year spent in Denver was shrouded in disappointment. Now he is in Washington, where he has been named the guy more out of circumstance than desire. <p> " I 'm going to be who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Keenum, via NBC Sports Washington. " I assure this team, I assure the fans of this team, I assure anybody that cares that I 'm going to give everything I got, no matter what. " <p> If there 's anyone in the NFL that knows how quickly things can take a turn for the worst, it 's Keenum. After his breakout season with the Vikings, Keenum was signed by the Broncos where he went 6-10 and was later traded to Washington. By happenstance, he was named the starting QB again, and he knows it could be taken away at any moment. <p> " I 've learned from what I 've done well in the past and I 've learned a lot more from what I 've not done well, " said Keenum. " That goes with everything, with being the job of starting quarterback. " <p> It will be his job for the first few weeks of the season, at least. Should he succeed, it could stay his job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the conversation that comes after that. <h> Gallery <h> Cutting Room Floor : 6 Redskins who are playing for their jobs this week
