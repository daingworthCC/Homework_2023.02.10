K. Chesterton noted during his speaking tour in America in the 1920s that " America is the only nation in the world that is founded on a creed. That creed is set forth with dogmatic and even theological lucidity in the Declaration of Independence ; perhaps the only piece of practical politics that is also theoretical politics and also great literature. " <p> July 4 marks the 243rd anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. Most Americans can probably recite by heart the Declaration 's ringing phrases that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. " <p> Likely less familiar is that Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr. and -- perhaps surprising to many -- Clarence Thomas have been the leading voices about the Declaration in American history. <p> Scott Douglas Gerber is a visiting professor at Brown University 's Political Theory Project and a law professor at Ohio Northern University. <p> According to John Adams, when Jefferson came to the Continental Congress in 1775 he " brought with him a reputation for literature, science, and a happy talent for composition. Writings of his were handed about, remarkable for the peculiar felicity of expression. " Indeed, as Chesterton understood, the " peculiar felicity " with which the Declaration was written plays no small part in the power of its message. Jefferson( and Adams) died 50 years to the day after the Declaration was issued. <p> Abraham Lincoln, America 's only true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader in the history of the United States. " Let us revere the Declaration of Independence, " Lincoln proclaimed in one of his many speeches about America 's founding document. " Let us re-adopt the Declaration of Independence, and with it the practices and policy which harmonize with it. " <p> Lincoln 's most famous speech, 1863 's Gettysburg Address, championed the Declaration as the foundation of the republic : a foundation that had been undermined by the apologists for slavery. Lincoln said : " Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth, on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. " <p> The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. echoed Lincoln 's thoughts about the centrality of the Declaration to the origins, purposes, and ideals of America. In the most celebrated speech of the 20th century, 1963 's " I Have a Dream, " King said : " In a sense we 've come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men -- yes, black men as well as white men -- would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. " <p> If Jefferson, Lincoln, and King were the leading voices on the Declaration of Independence in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, respectively, Clarence Thomas occupies that role in the present century. <p> For example, Thomas wrote in a law journal article more than 30 years ago, while he was chairman of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, that the " founding principles of equality and liberty " set forth in the Declaration " dictate the policy of action towards Black Americans, " and he quoted the Declaration in a U.S. Supreme Court opinion as recently as June of this year in support of the proposition that our founding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are both knowable and objectively true. " <p> Obviously, Jefferson, Lincoln, King, and Thomas frequently differed on questions of public policy. To mention the most consequential area of disagreement, King was the leader of the traditional civil rights community 's political campaign for racial justice in America, and Thomas is the most prominent critic of their color-conscious approach. <p> These four men shared a commitment to the Declaration of Independence as the unalterable expression of the pre-eminence of individual rights in the American republic, however. <p> " To secure these rights, " the Declaration proclaims, " governments are instituted among men. " When Jefferson wrote the Declaration during the summer of 1776, he was inspired by the prevailing individual rights political theory of the day( most notably, the political theory of 17th-century British theorist John Locke). <p> When Lincoln condemned slavery in the 1850s and 1860s, he was doing so on individual rights grounds( slaves were people, Lincoln insisted, who were entitled to enjoy the rights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When King delivered his " I Have a Dream " speech, his " dream " was that his children would one day live in a nation " where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. " <p> And when Thomas writes opinions as a Supreme Court justice criticizing racial preferences in civil rights cases, he anchors his opinions in the individual rights philosophy of the Declaration. <p> Of course, people are free to disagree with what Jefferson, Lincoln, King, and Thomas have said about America 's founding document... again, they frequently differed with each other about what policies would best effectuate the Declaration 's concept of equality. <p> But it is important to understand why they said what they did. I ca n't imagine a better day to try than the Fourth of July. <p> Scott Douglas Gerber is a visiting professor at Brown University 's Political Theory Project and a law professor at Ohio Northern University.
