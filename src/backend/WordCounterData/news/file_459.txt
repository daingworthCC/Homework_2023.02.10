4060541 The resplendent French-bordello touches that make Napoleon bistro romantic and Local 16 the picture of pretty? All the chandeliers, expansive mirrors, banquettes and the ubiquitous use of ebony that are seemingly synonymous with any new bar in Washington? <p> You can thank designers Mick Mier and Joe Steger for that. <p> The pair, partners in the design firm Mier Steger Browne, have launched a place of their own, 1905, a cozy new Ninth Street restaurant and lounge that bears all their unmistakable decadent touches, with other elements that they could have put only into a place of their own. Joseph Belcher and Phil Rodriguez( from H Street 's Sticky Rice) are also partners in the project. <p> For one thing, they 've built nearly everything themselves : handmade tables, chandeliers -- even the framed mirrors -- that fill the space, along with a couple of gorgeous sconces that look like lotuses. A large trunk functions as a table, and a few quirky paintings dot the walls. <p> " It 's a different kind of labor, " says Mier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work they 've done for others.
