3049241 <p> Meteors, surly simians and Manhattan-stomping monsters are n't the only fare coming to local cinemas this summer. Even as blockbusters dominate the movie landscape, the summer also brings the rare crop of independents, imports and assorted oddities. <p> So, when the malls fill up with wretched excess and you 're starving for something that does n't turn the brain into taffy, consider the alternatives and remember that " Mrs. Brown, " " Lone Star, " " Eat Drink Man Woman, " " The Adjuster " and " Prizzi 's Honor " were all summer releases. Here are some to look forward to. <p>. <p> -- " Under the Skin, " June 5. <p> Two sisters compete for their mother 's love. Rose, played by Claire Rushbrook of " Secrets &; Lies, " is married and pregnant. Iris, played by Samantha Morton of the recent BBC version of " Tom Jones, " is an angry hellion who loses herself in sexual promiscuity when their mother( Rita Tushingham) dies unexpectedly. <p> " I wanted to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that represent women in lead roles, " says British writer-director Carine Adler. " A bit like the David Thewlis character in Naked. ' I wanted that complexity in a woman 's role. <p> " Iris is quite an aggressive, angry character. It 's hard for me to describe the film as dark. Despite the subject matter, I find that there is humor in the film. When I see Claire and Sam together, the sibling rivalry makes me smile. I understand it. " <p> Much of Adler 's research came from " Mother, Madonna, Whore, " a book about promiscuity and the ways in which women act out anger differently from men. " It 's by Estela Welldon, a forensic psychotherapist who 's dealt with sexual perversion in women and was a consultant on the script. <p> " But the film is not an intellectual film, " Adler says. " It 's a very, very emotional film that affects audiences emotionally and often divides them. " <p>. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes her feature debut with this gritty teen drama, set in 1981, which was inspired in part by Susan Sontag 's statement that high school is the most informative experience of our lives. Liza Weil plays Anna, a vulnerable 17-year-old New Jersey girl who walks on the wild side with her flashy best friend Brenda( Chad Morgan). Frederic Forrest plays Anna 's art teacher and mentor, and Kathyn Rossetter is her divorced mother. <p> " I called the film Whatever ' because( in high school) we all tried to maintain the facade that nothing mattered when, in fact, it did matter, " Skoog says. " It all mattered very much. <p> " Some people have called this the prequel to Welcome to the Dollhouse ' because the characters are a bit on the outskirts, and they 're both dark stories about girls having trouble. Stylistically it 's very different : Welcome to the Dollhouse ' is satirical, and mine is more social realism. " <p> Skoog says she " wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it is to be an adolescent in this country, which I felt I 'd never seen onscreen. The Breakfast Club ' and Sixteen Candles ' did n't really portray that truth : They did n't show drinking and what you do when you get off cocaine ; they did n't show the kids who are n't worried about going to the prom. " <p> Everything that happens in the film, she says, " is stuff I saw people do or what my best friend and I talked about doing and never did. " When her best friend saw the film, Skoog says, " She said, Boy, it 's pretty tame. ' She thought it was pretty rugged for a film, but we did a lot worse stuff that you really ca n't put in the film. " <p>. <p> -- " The Opposite of Sex, " June 12. <p> Writer Don Roos( " Boys on the Side ") makes his directing debut with this Sundance Film Festival hit about Bill( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gay couple whose bliss is ruined when Bill 's teenage half-sister Deedee( Christina Ricci) runs off with Matt. Lisa Kudrow plays the sister of Bill 's deceased lover, and Lyle Lovett is a local sheriff with a crush on Kudrow. <p> " Matt becomes bi for a few weeks, " Roos explains. " It 's a temporary attack. " He calls the film " an equal opportunity offender " and thinks its greatest hook is the Ricci character : " She 's tough-talking and rebellious and offensive, and she 's absolutely the most politically incorrect person you would see in a movie nowadays. Gidget she ai n't. " <p> Recalling Ricci 's early role in " The Addams Family, " Roos calls Deedee " Wednesday Addams with breasts, " and says, " It 's fun to see a former child star behave so badly. " <p> Like Patty Duke in " Valley of the Dolls "? <p> " I hope to aspire to that level of artistry, " Roos says. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small role as a waiter, used to write TV shows( " Hart to Hart, " " The Colbys ") before creating such screenplays as " Love Field, " " Single White Female " and the " Diabolique " remake. <p> His training occurred at the University of Notre Dame, which he calls " a finishing school for depravity. My movie is actually very conservative. It 's about the consequences of sex : It 's an anti-free-love movie. " <p>. <p> -- " Marius and Jeannette, " June or July. <p> Directed in French by Robert Guediguian, this is a warm, middle-age love story, set in Estaque, a small port district in Marseilles that inspired several paintings by Cezanne. Marius( Gerard Meylan) is a shy, lonely laborer who works as a guard for a cement factory, and Jeannette( Ariane Ascaride) is a fiery checkout clerk with two children. <p> Guediguian, who was born in Marseille of a German mother and Armenian father, places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a trace of Marcel Pagnol. The neighbors, including an old couple who grudgingly fall in love, all know each other 's business. <p> Ascaride spoke by phone from France : " Gerard and I have made all Robert Guediguian 's films, and Gerard has known Robert since they were little boys in the same school. We are very, very good friends. To play with Gerard is like a game, a great pleasure. He has a great heart, and it 's very simple to act with him. " <p> Ascaride calls the film " a miracle " and says it draws the same warm response in every country where it has opened. " I was in Spain last week, and the audience is the same. It 's like in France, and that is the miracle of Marius and Jeannette ' for me : We have made the film in the little corner of the world, this little port of France, in a little house, but the problems that are developed are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> -- " Billy 's Hollywood Screen Kiss, " July 31. <p> Billy( Sean P. Hayes) is a struggling Los Angeles photographer who ca n't find the right guy. Along comes Gabriel( Brad Rowe), a sexually ambiguous hunk who may be the answer to his dreams. On the other hand, he may be a dead-end fantasy. <p> Shot in lush CinemaScope and inspired by such cinematic sources as " Gidget " movies, Doris Day romps and filmmakers Douglas Sirk and Russ Meyer, " Billy 's Hollywood Screen Kiss " was directed by Tommy O'Haver. O'Haver has parlayed this first feature into a contract at Universal : He 'll direct " Archie, " a musical version of the comic book. <p> " I wanted Billy 's ' to look like an old ' 50s melodrama, " O'Haver says. " I had the director of photography look at Tarnished Angels ' and also at L'Avventura ' and La Dolce Vita ' because I really love wide-screen black and white. But David Moseley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder to sell. He was taking a big financial risk, and I wanted to honor that. <p> " The way I like to pitch the film is William Wyler 's The Heiress ' meets Russ Meyer 's Beyond the Valley of the Dolls. ' Structurally, it 's very similar to The Heiress ' : I basically see Billy as the protagonist of a women 's melodrama, and Gabriel as the Montgomery Clift character. It 's never clear if he 's in love with Billy or just in it for the money. <p> " I did n't really have a political stance with this film. It was really just a matter of expressing emotions in a cinematic way, and wanting to tell a story where it did n't really matter whether the protagonist was gay or straight. "
