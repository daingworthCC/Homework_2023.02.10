3070741 <p> Last week, president Keli McGregor assumed a different role with the Rockies. In an exclusive interview, McGregor became more boss than friend to his general manager and manager, admitting " there 's no excuse for the way we 've played. " <p> There 's no question McGregor likes Dan O'Dowd and Clint Hurdle. But McGregor realizes everyone must be held responsible for this disappointing start. It does n't take a translator to read between the lines and know that Hurdle 's seat on the bench is simmering. <p> McGregor admitted the front-office frustration is not fiction or a media creation. <p> That is the most encouraging development of this difficult stretch. Those in charge - and as the president, McGregor speaks for ownership - are upset. Since the club embarked on an unannounced youth movement during the 2004 season, the Rockies have asked for patience. Let the kids develop. <p> When the plan was criticized, McGregor spoke correctly about the importance of staying the course. <p> That 's what made his remarks Wednesday so important. McGregor made it known for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that it 's unacceptable. Because of their plan to build from within, the Rockies have not in recent years measured their business by baseball 's bottom line, the standings. McGregor 's remarks represented a significance shift in that regard. <p> For a team to win, winning must be the top priority. Certainly payroll is a reflection of a team 's desire to win, and if that payroll does n't go up, the Rockies will always be challenged to succeed. <p> Beyond the money, there needs to be an attitude, a zero-tolerance for mediocrity - or worse - at all levels. Here 's why : Players feel singled out for the franchise 's recent failure. Since 2004, Hurdle has talked about accountability and responsibility. <p> Three years later, he remains in charge, but players who failed or became too expensive were discarded. That sends a strong message in the clubhouse, creates a dynamic in which the players want to win more for themselves than the organization. Baseball breeds selfishness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However, when a team struggles, as the Rockies have this season, that lacking bond between players and organization can cause a quick unraveling because there 's no greater good at work. <p> Those not around this team every day refer to Hurdle as a " players ' manager. " Truth is, he has n't filled that role since he left his hitting instructor post. This season, Hurdle recognized the need to adjust his approach, admitting he wanted to walk " not out in front of the players, but side by side. " <p> If the Rockies were going to win, they needed to be in this together. Hurdle, to his credit, has been less vocal, less overbearing. During the recent Diamondbacks series, for instance, a scout who has seen hundreds of Rockies games said it was the first time he could n't hear Hurdle from the dugout. <p> Hurdle has also stopped bouncing the ball in the dugout, a practice that annoyed some players. More important, he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, something they have noticed. <p> Hurdle 's challenge is to regain the feel he had as a hitting coach, where he would become a chameleon to extract the most out of each pupil. He 's unbelievably intelligent. He has to trust his gut, avoid the temptation to overmanage and put his fingerprints on a game. He has nothing to lose - except for you know what. <p> The first step was in the right direction : All parties( McGregor, O'Dowd and Hurdle) took responsibility for the start. Now, they have to follow through and remember it 's the finish that counts. Nothing else matters at this point. <p> Jake the Ace <p> Jake Peavy, stardom. Stardom, Jake Peavy. After a perplexing 2006 season, one that went sideways following his participation in the World Baseball Classic, Peavy has returned to his throne as the National League West 's most dominant pitcher. Peavy starts today against the Brewers, looking for his seventh win. He owns a 1.63 ERA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rival executive who predicted Peavy would win the Cy Young before the season said : " His mound presence is a combination of David Cone and Kevin Brown. " And, oh, he has a breaking ball that turns knees to custard. <p> Footnotes <p> Miguel Cabrera 's size - he 's about 250 pounds - is becoming a concern. The Marlins slugger can still rake, but he ca n't continue at third base at that weight. Look for him to adopt a better offseason approach.... The Yankees are highly unlikely to trade for Todd Helton for two reasons : They need to get younger, and they appear stuck with Jason Giambi, who has become untradeable recently... Some of the best trades are the ones never made. The Rockies wanted to pluck away Carl Pavano from the Yankees last winter. Now, Pavano will undergo season-ending elbow surgery.... GM Brian Cashman and manager Joe Torre are on the hook if the Yankees ' fortunes do n't turn around. Why should Rockies fans care? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a strong candidate to replace Torre, as is Don Mattingly.... O'Dowd was in California a few weeks ago scouting infielders Mike Moustakas, who has chosen Scott Boras as his adviser, and Matt Dominguez. Other names to file away as candidates for the eighth pick of the draft : pitchers Ross Detwiler of Missouri State and Phillippe Aumont, a towering( 6-foot-7) prep standout from <p> Quebec. <p> Troy E. Renck can be reached at 303-954-1301 or trenck@denverpost.com <p> EYE ON. <p> SS J.J. HARDY, MILWAUKEE BREWERS <p> Background : As the Rockies were celebrating the spring-training arrivals of Mike Hampton and Denny Neagle in the spring of 2001, J.J. Hardy was putting together quite a rsum across town at Tucson Sabino High. The Brewers noticed, drafting him in the second round. Hardy suffered a shoulder injury in Triple-A three years ago that nearly derailed his career. He became depressed, leaning on his brother Logan, who served in Iraq, to help restore his confidence. <p> What 's up : Consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J.J. is a legitimate candidate to win National League MVP honors. His 15 home runs in 194 at-bats exceed his career total in his first two seasons. Entering Saturday 's games, Hardy led the league in RBIs with 43. Most remarkable about Hardy 's resurgence is the fact that he was always known for his glove. That 's why general manager Doug Melvin so staunchly supported Hardy while he struggled to hit his weight during his rookie season. " A lot of young players usually do n't make it. But we thought that we had a chance for two to three to be all-stars in Hardy,( Rickie) Weeks and( Prince) Fielder. We believed they would do it, even though we were n't sure it would be this soon, " Melvin said. <p> What 's next : The Brewers are no longer a baseball synonym for " witness relocation program. " Folks know about Milwaukee this season - several players recently appeared on the top-rated soap opera " The Young and the Restless, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the focus in opponents ' meetings before a series. <p> Renck 's take : At his current pace, Hardy would hit 51 home runs and drive in 145 - and presumably chase his nickname to J-Hard, or something clever. A 30-HR, 100-RBI season would be terrific and is possible for two reasons : Hardy has protection in the lineup, particularly with the menacing presence of Fielder. And he has good plate discipline. That 's what gives his start roots. As long as Hardy continues to be selective at the plate, he will be Milwaukee 's most valuable shortstop since Hall of Famer Robin Yount. <p> -- AT ISSUE FATHER 'S LAWSUIT MISSES POINT IN HANCOCK DEATH <p> What : With normalcy slowly returning to the St. Louis Cardinals, Dean Hancock, the father of late pitcher Josh Hancock, filed a lawsuit Thursday, claiming the restaurant continued serving his son even after he was intoxicated. Dean Hancock, right, also claims the driver of the tow truck his son hit and the driver of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disabled vehicle more swiftly. <p> Background : No one wants to bury a son or daughter, so I wo n't pretend to understand Dean Hancock 's pain. His son was a likable teammate, Cardinals players told me, who did grunt work as a middle reliever. But he had issues. That 's why the Cincinnati Reds released him in spring training two years ago, citing his poor conditioning. <p> Renck 's take : It 's true that any Cardinal who walks into Mike Shannon 's high-end restaurant a few blocks from Busch Stadium will be treated like royalty. It 's good business to have players around. Of course, the bar staff is responsible for cutting off a patron who gets too inebriated. Still for me, it comes back to the fact Josh Hancock was 29 years old, not 21. Personal responsi- <p> bility and accountability come with age, and, frankly, his profession. Josh Hancock made decisions that night that, according to the police report, left him impaired. He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cellphone, arranging for an acquaintance to meet him at another bar, when the accident occurred, police said. The court case will determine if the vehicle he struck could have been moved more quickly. Still, that misses the point. Hancock would n't have hit the vehicle, in my opinion, had he not chosen to drink that night to the point at which his blood-alcohol level was nearly twice Missouri 's legal limit. Shifting blame sends a wrong message as much as drinking and driving. <p> THE RISE AND FALL <p> ROYALS STARTING <p> TO PLAY BETTER <p> THREE UP <p> 1. Royals : At a recent banquet, team president encouraged fans to come see the team - and did n't follow it with an apology or punch line. <p> 2. Padres : First baseman Adrian Gonzalez is making a bid for the All-Star Game. <p> 3. Marlins : SS Hanley Ramirez is chasing a batting title in his sophomore season. <p> THREE DOWN <p> 1. Pirates : During Cardinals ' sweeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " <p> 2. Reds : Other than Ken Griffey Jr., the team has become hard to watch.
