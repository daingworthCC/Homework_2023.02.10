3033441 <p> David Dwares was born in 1963 but describes himself as a New Deal liberal, one who believes that " government can do good. " He is a young associate at a high-powered Washington firm, but devotes hundreds of hours a year to volunteer " pro bono " work. He is a litigator, but has zeroed in on one of the least glamorous and most heart-rending fields of poverty law : winning Social Security benefits for people with AIDS. <p> On Wednesday, Dwares will receive the D.C. Bar 's Pro Bono Lawyer of the Year award. He sounds slightly embarrassed by all the fuss. And that 's not false modesty. <p> " A lot of us who work with him call him ' the saint, ' " said Dinah Wiley, legal services director at the Whitman Walker Clinic, who nominated him for the honor. " But do n't say that. He would be mortified. " <p> For all the criticism of young people who flocked to the law in the 1980s for big money, Dwares is proof that some young people wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And his employer, Ross, Dixon &; Masback, a 58-lawyer litigation boutique, has shown that with creativity and commitment even a mid-size firm can harness lawyers for a big impact in volunteer, legal work -- known as pro bono, from Latin meaning " for the good. " <p> One of the firm 's founders, Harold " Skip " Masback, developed a concept in which the firm would have " institutional pro bono clients, " just as it has corporations as a paying clients for all kinds of work, according to partner Kevin LaCroix, the firm 's pro bono coordinator. That way, the firm could become expert in handling the pro bono client 's problems and involve more lawyers, from first-year associates to partners. <p> Ross, Dixon 's idea is only one of many refreshing approaches to pro bono in town. Washington and San Francisco " have no peers " when it comes to commitment to pro bono, according to Esther Lardent, an American Bar Association consultant. When the ABA started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big firms to commit to pro bono work up to 5 percent of the time they rack up in billable hours, 17 D.C. firms quickly joined up. <p> Meanwhile, D.C. lawyers are inventing new approaches to volunteer service. <p> In 1989, Jeffrey Keitelman went to partners at his firm of Shaw, Pittman, Potts &; Trowbridge with an idea that would enable folks with demanding schedules to do community service : Administrators would search out service needs, then assign teams to these projects, with an eye to overbooking volunteers. That way, if a volunteer canceled, it would n't hurt the project or leave the volunteer " feeling guilty, " Keitelman said. The volunteer could return for service later. His brainchild, backed by Shaw, Pittman resources, has grown into D.C. Cares, a full-time organization that now has 5,000 volunteers on its books. <p> In another twist on pro bono, Crowell &; Moring plans to trade in its lavish, biennial retreat, held at West Virginia 's Greenbrier resort in 1989 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inc., which rehabilitates homes for the needy. On Oct. 23, 400 Crowell lawyers and staff will descend on various Jubilee projects. The idea was raised at a partners ' meeting and " just swept around the room, " said partner Brian Elmer. <p> At Ross, Dixon, founded in 1983, pro bono was a priority from the start. In 1992, the firm spent nearly 6 percent of its time on pro bono. <p> In 1988, the year Dwares joined Ross, Dixon, the firm voted to work with Whitman Walker, which serves clients with AIDS. Dwares 's first pro bono client was C.W. Johnson, who had worked his way from dishwasher to head cook in a D.C. restaurant during 27 years of employment. But Johnson was denied Social Security disability benefits when, suffering from AIDS, he became too ill to work in February 1988. <p> Dwares set out to appeal Johnson 's case. But in what Dwares later described as a " comedy of errors, " Johnson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and to Wilkes-Barre, Pa., for typing. Ultimately it was " lost, " and Dwares had to argue the case a second time. <p> More than 27 months after he applied, Johnson got his first benefit check for $ 747. A month later, a check for $ 7,927 arrived at Johnson 's house. By that time, Johnson was dead. <p> But Dwares would n't let the issue die. In an outraged, 12-page letter to the Social Security Administration, Dwares detailed the bungled Johnson case and argued that " there is a chance to do after Johnson 's death what was not done while he was alive -- assure that justice is done. " Dwares got the lumbering Social Security Administration to establish new procedures to speed disability claims filed by terminally ill applicants. <p> " In typical David-style, " said his colleague David Perry, no one knew about what he 'd done until a story hit the front page of The Washington Post. " I could not believe if they federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd want this to happen, " Dwares said last week. " It was the perfect opportunity to do something. " <p> Dwares also has developed a training manual on Social Security cases and trains other lawyers. He sits on Whitman-Walker 's legal services committee, and according to staff lawyer Philip Fornaci, Dwares 's " enthusiasm has attracted other firms " to tackle this dry, thankless work. Fornaci also commended Dwares 's habit, one he has passed on to others, to visit each client at his home. " These attorneys make six-figure incomes, " said Fornaci. " They are not used to going to areas like Southeast or dealing with a really sick person. " But, said Fornaci, Dwares insists a home visit is vital to gain the client 's trust and to present each case more effectively to a judge. <p> Even after several years of representing AIDs victims, Dwares said, it is still troubling " to work with someone sentenced to death. " <p> But Dwares believes that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduces a client 's stress, perhaps he can prolong a life by a few days or weeks. " This becomes just so important, " Dwares said. " You are in a unique place to help people. " <p> Two New Ms. Presidents <p> The D.C. Bar has elected Pauline Schneider president-elect -- the first black woman elected as leader of the 42,000-member Bar. Mark Tuohey, of Reed Smith Shaw &; McClay, takes over the presidency Wednesday from Jamie Gorelick, the Defense Department 's general counsel. Next June, Schneider succeeds Tuohey. <p> Schneider, of Hunton &; Williams, will become the fourth woman to lead the bar since 1984, when Marna Tucker spoke of the excitement of being the Bar 's first woman president. " I knew I was not going to be the last, " she said Friday. " Now, I think... race or sex is not a hindrance, as it used to be. It is, I hope, irrelevant " in choosing bar leaders. <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Fite and O'Brien, is installed as president-elect of the Virginia State Bar, the first woman to lead Virginia 's 18,500 lawyers. <p> Victory for Virginia Bar <p> After a bruising intra-bar battle, the Virginia Supreme Court last week ordered that interest earned on client " trust accounts " be funneled to the Virginia Law Foundation for legal aid and other good works. <p> Ruling 4 to 3, the court sided with the Virginia State Bar, mandating that lawyers put settlements and other client funds they hold for short periods into interest-bearing accounts. <p> Bar President William Rakes argued that the system makes good use of money that had been interest-free, benefiting only the banks. <p> But small-firm lawyers protested it will cause bureaucratic headaches : About 83 percent of 930 lawyers answering a Virginia Lawyers Weekly poll opposed the rule. The Virginia Bankers Association also argued that it was unconstitutional. <p> Rakes said the bar will work to educate the opponents. Still, the bankers are talking about a possible challenge in federal court.
