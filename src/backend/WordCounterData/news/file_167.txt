3033141 <p> " I 'm under the false impression that if I do n't do my will and do n't get life insurance, I wo n't ever die, " confessed a friend in his thirties who lives in Maryland with his wife and young daughter. " Seriously, it 's hard to face, " he added. " That 's where my longevity lies. " <p> Undertaking the paperwork of one 's own demise is n't a cheery prospect, as most people who 've done it know and those who have n't might suspect. One estimate puts those who do n't do wills at three-fourths of all adult Americans. Through my first 40 years, I was one of those truants. Making out a last will and testament never made my short list of things to do. <p> Since then, occasionally " do will " would get scribbled in somewhere between " look up meaning of zazen " and " clean out refrigerator. " Which is only to say that divvying up postmortem earthly possessions, the ones you ca n't take with you, still did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their distance. As novelist John Updike observed in an American Heritage magazine article titled " Facing Death, " in this country, especially, the big chill has been " rendered increasingly abstract -- a choreographed plunge on the television screen, the punch of a red button in a bomber or a computer game, a statistic in a column of print. " <p> Meaning the D-word is hard to take personally -- until it 's too late. <p> Something changed that for me -- the birth of my son. <p> Not initially though. My theory goes that infants change everything by reconnecting us to forgotten feelings of our own early childhood. But those birth-and-being impulses attached to the beginning of life 's continuum are opposite from death and dying at its other end. Only when babies grow into walking, talking, thinking little mortals do we painfully envision fleeting images of them without yours truly in the family portrait. <p> " Do will " moved up on the list of chores. " Plant perennials " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another trip to Hechinger could provide a reprieve from the inevitable. But one thing was clear : Just as there are no guaranteed everyday low prices in the afterlife, there are no guarantees your will will be done once you 're gone -- unless your will is done before you 're gone. <p> Then one day someone mentioned what he 'd heard on the now blessedly departed " thirtysomething " TV show. You remember, the whiny one that used to pit husbands and wives and friends in bitter struggle over the channel changer every Thursday night? Seems there was a silver lining to that show after all. " If you and your wife die without wills, " he said, " your choice of legal guardian for your child is n't legally recorded. So you 're leaving it up to the state courts to decide who will raise your child. " <p> This bothered me. Chances are good, of course, that my wife and I wo n't take leave of the planet simultaneously. And even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the right choice of guardian for our child with the help from our next of kin. <p> Or would it? What if the unthinkable happened and the court did n't make the right decision? What if the judge had a migraine and was n't thinking straight? What if, for even one single night, at the most traumatic time of his young life, the son who means everything in the world to me was placed in a foster home with total strangers? <p> The what-ifs smacked me backside the head. If all the other arguments for doing a will had n't been convincing enough, this one was : Why in my wildest dreams would I knowingly entrust the future of my children to a government bureaucracy? <p> Soon after, paging through a copy of Jane Bryant Quinn 's recent bestseller, " Making the Most of Your Money, " I ran into one more nudge : " You would n't go out at night and leave your youngsters without a babysitter. Why would you go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time to take care of business. <p> Which proves to be precisely the best way to view writing one 's will : unpleasant business. If you personalize it too much, you do n't do it. So think of it in the same terms as paying the mechanic $ 600 no matter what 's wrong with the car. Or figuring your federal taxes. Car repairs, taxes, or death -- you hate to have to deal with it, but there are few certainties in life and these are them. <p> The next hardest thing once you 've decided to write a will is to make an appointment with an attorney. Dying and lawyers both rank low in popularity polls. Neither comes cheap, and lumping them together only seems to inflate prices. For an uncomplicated joint will, plus living will and durable power of attorney documents for each of us( there 's convincing reasons to have these, too), my wife and I paid just over $ 500. <p> That buys a lot at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's typical of such wills. Probably there are cheaper lawyers around. Some legal chains advertise that they do wills for simple estates for as little as $ 75 a person. There are also inexpensive legal forms at stationary stores for making wills, and workbooks and software products designed to help do-it-yourselfers produce a legal will at a fraction of the price. But we were comfortable with our lawyer ; he knows our family and has handled transactions for us before. And since discomfort is the major obstacle to doing wills, having him guide us gently was worth the cost. Not to say it was n't an ordeal nonetheless : <p> To make a will, you need an estimate of your net worth, the dollar value of your existence -- equity in your home, property and possessions, savings and investments -- plus what you 're worth dead from life insurance policies, etcetera. Nothing else short of running for president or getting a mortgage forces this kind of materialistic introspection. And a sticker price on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheapened -- so keep in mind that the best things in life are free and not factored into this equation. <p> You will be required to name an executor, the person you appoint to carry out directions in the will. Suddenly, you must size up candidates -- close family and maybe friends -- by standards of competency far different than whether they remember to return garden tools they borrowed or whether they 're congenial guests at parties. Preferably the person has agreed beforehand to perform the task, which also means you must broach the subject beyond the walls of your lawyer 's office. <p> Biggest decision is who gets the kids if the worst-case scenario goes down. This pushes to the limit envisioning life as it might waltz along despite your absence, and that 's kind of depressing. Even if the choice is clear, there remains the matter of the trust. Estates of certain sizes( and we 're not talking Rockefeller size here) require establishing a trust for under-age beneficiaries. Is the named guardian-to-be willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you pen in the name of a local bank as trustee and put your progeny 's inheritance in the hands of a paid professional with no emotional attachment? <p> Small decisions over unlikely scenarios weigh heavily in writing wills. At our lawyer 's suggestion, we decided that if dire circumstances create a trust, besides the financial maintenance for education, clothes, and other daily needs, the big payoff( as it were) would come when the youngest child turns 24, or once all children graduate from four-year colleges, whichever comes first. But that night one thought jammed my sleeping mechanism : What if one of our children is an " artiste " who wants nothing more than to go to Paris looking for answers? Do I want to interfere from the grave with such an honorable quest? <p> The best part of doing a will is having done it. It 's like the **34;143;TOOLONG analogy ; walking away from the final sign-off, with witnesses and notaries and everything legal and tidy, feels far better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straightened out a horrible mess long before it happens. As if you 'd given lots of people you care about one less reason to be sore at you at the end of the line. Best of all, I think much less about wills now -- except when someone past a certain age, someone with a spouse and children, mentions offhand that he does n't have a will. <p> A phone conversation with a California friend last week turned to finances : Proudly she said that when she turned 35 earlier this year, she decided time had come to be a grown-up about money, 401(k) plans and investment matters, and even planning for retirement. She 'd bought Jane Bryant Quinn 's book. " That woman is God, " she said. " I 'm following her advice word by word. It 's like the 10 commandments of personal finances. " <p> " Did you get the commandment about wills yet? " I asked. <p> " Uh, wills? " she said. Of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the sixth, sooner or later. " I have n't got to wills yet, " she sputtered. " Do I need to? " <p> As the mighty Quinn puts the bottom line on wills : " You own stuff. You will die. Someone will get that stuff. "
