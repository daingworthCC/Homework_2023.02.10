3003241 <p> In the end, the full truth about Luc Jouret may become known only after Swiss pathologists determine whether he chose to die alongside members of his esoteric sect here this week or whether he slipped away after arranging a mass murder disguised as collective suicide. <p> What is already known, though, is that well before 48 bodies were found dead in two Swiss villages this week, things had started to go wrong for Mr. Jouret and his secretive Order of the Solar Temple. <p> Former sect members say there were growing tensions within the group. Others say there was a power struggle between Mr. Jouret and his shadowy associate, Joseph di Mambro. Canadian reports said the sect may have engaged in paramilitary activities, arms trafficking and money laundering. The Swiss police say they have found documents suggesting an internal squabble over money. <p> The image that Mr. Jouret presented to his 300 to 400 Swiss, French and Canadian followers was that of a charismatic preacher obsessed with the coming apocalypse and certain he had the answers to all the mysteries of Nature, spiritualism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a far darker side, one that drew him to money and may have led him to carry out murder. On Friday, convinced that some of the sect members found dead on Wednesday did not commit suicide, the Swiss police issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Jouret and Mr. di Mambro. The police in Quebec, where five more bodies were found in the ruins of a burned out house owned by Mr. di Mambro, also suspect murder. <p> Yet there is no certainty that the two cult leaders are still alive. They may have gone into hiding, but one or the other may also be among 10 badly burned bodies taken from a fire-ravaged Swiss chalet that have still to be identified. And if Mr. Jouret is dead, the image that will remain will be that of a deranged man who came to believe his own doomsday ravings. <p> At first sight, the idea of a collective suicide does not seem remote, since Mr. Jouret spoke endlessly of " the final end " brought on by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to his followers. " We are in a circle of fire, " he wrote in the 1980 's. " Everything is being consumed. We are about to make a leap in macro-evolution. " <p> On the other hand, he had learned to use his charm, good looks and apparent passionate faith in his beliefs to build his own little empire in which, even more than controlling the considerable wealth accumulated by the sect, he controlled the minds of his followers. <p> The tragedy was of course unexpected. Dozens of religious, New Age and spiritual renewal sects operate quietly in Switzerland, and hundreds more in Quebec and throughout Europe, rarely noticed even by the press. Now suddenly, all available information about Mr. Jouret 's life is being scrutinized in an effort to understand what happened. From Colonial Africa To Medical School <p> He was born on Oct. 18, 1947, in the Belgian Congo -- now Zaire -- to Belgian parents. Mr. Jouret later boasted that he was only 4 when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doctor. And indeed, in 1974 he graduated as a physician from the Free University of Brussels. <p> Little is known of his early years, although his older brother, Bernard, told a Belgian newspaper this week that he had been a gifted child. <p> " He was sociable, intelligent and athletic, " Bernard Jouret said. " He loved sport. For him, life was competition. " He said that Luc had not been a strong child, but that as an adolescent he followed a strict diet and emerged as a good alpinist. <p> In his late teens and early 20 's, he apparently had some ties to a group called the Walloon Communist Youth in the French-speaking region of Belgium. When he later did his military service with the Belgian paratroopers, he reportedly told one friend that he would help " communism to clean out the army. " <p> After briefly working as a surgeon, general practitioner and obstetrician, he was soon attracted to homeopathy. Recognized as a medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that uses small doses of medications that produce the same symptoms as the disease being treated. By 1976 Mr. Jouret was practising alternative medicine in the Belgian mining region of Borinage. <p> Around 1977, he visited the Philippines to study psychic healing and came away impressed. " My brother never stopped talking about the Filipino healers, how they did remarkable things with only their hands, " Bernard Jouret recalled. " I was dismayed how someone so intelligent could be taken in by these stories. " A Doctor Drawn To Foreign Lands <p> According to some versions, Mr. Jouret also visited China, India, Mexico and Argentina to study nontraditional medicine. By 1981 he had set up a homeopathic practice in Leglise, a small town in eastern Belgium. His landlord at the time, Michel Simon, a local butcher, remembers him warmly. " He took care of his patients for nothing, " Mr. Simon said this week. <p> Mr. Jouret married a French woman in 1980 -- only her first name, Christine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who died as a baby. The marriage apparently did not last, and there is no evidence that he lived or traveled with any particular woman in recent years. <p> His interests were reaching beyond homeopathy. In 1982, Mr. Jouret moved his clinic to Annemasse in the Haute-Savoie region of France near the border with Switzerland, drawn, it seems, by his new links to the Renewed Order of the Temple. <p> This was one of at least 30 groups claiming to be the successors to the Knights Templars, a powerful and secretive Catholic military order that emerged from the Crusades and flourished in the 12th and 13th centuries. <p> Swiss sect experts say that when Jacques Origas, the Renewed Order 's founder, died in 1981, Mr. Jouret tried to take over the group. But he failed, and in 1984 he either resigned or was expelled. <p> By then, though, he had already begun to make his name as a lecturer on homeopathic, ecological and health topics. And he was ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years that followed, the respectable -- homeopathic -- side of his public image and his growing interest in the occult became increasingly difficult to separate. By 1984, Mr. Jouret had already come in contact with Mr. di Mambro, and together they founded the International Chivalric Organization Solar Tradition, headquartered at the offices of Mr. di Mambro 's own Foundation Golden Way in Geneva. <p> Most significantly, Mr. Jouret began to operate at different levels. He formed the Amenta Club to serve as host to his paid lectures on topics like " Medicine and Conscience " and " Love and Biology. " Those won over by his message might then be introduced to a set of beliefs, rituals and a hierarchy by joining the Arcadia Club. <p> Only a few entered the secretive and mystical world of the Solar Order, and to join they had to contribute money and accept severe discipline. Cult Headquarters Moved to Quebec <p> Around 1986, Mr. Jouret moved to Quebec, accompanied by a handful of loyal followers. He and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 miles north of Montreal, which served as a headquarters for what is now called the Order of the Solar Temple. <p> At Ste. Anne de la Perade, halfway between Montreal and Quebec, Mr. Jouret established an organic farm that is still in operation. <p> Rose-Marie Klaus and her former husband followed Mr. Jouret to Canada from Switzerland and, she said, her husband provided the $500,000 needed to set up the organic farm. <p> " Jouret told people that a great cataclysm is going to take place and only the elected will survive, " Mrs. Klaus told Radio Canana in an interview in 1993. " He persuaded several people to leave Europe, to sell everything and invest in his projects. Jouret thinks he 's Christ. " <p> Perhaps his most notable success was to infiltrate Hydro Quebec, the province 's electrical utility. Through Jean-Pierre Vinet, a sect member who was the company 's projects manager, Mr. Jouret was invited in 1988 and 1989 to give a series of paid lectures to executives on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Self-Realization and Management. " The utility says that 17 of its employees are still linked to the sect. <p> In 1993, Mr. Jouret, Mr. Vinet and another sect member were charged with possession of illegal weapons. They pleaded guilty, but Mr. Jouret was only ordered to pay $1,000 to the Red Cross after persuading the judge that he needed a weapon for his own protection. <p> The Canadian police suspected him of worse. Soon after he arrived in Quebec, they had asked Swiss police for information about him. By 1992 they believed that Mr. Jouret was behind a paramilitary group known as Q-37, which threatened to kill the province 's Public Security Minister, Claude Ryan. <p> The sect was also investigated for possible links to bombings of two Hydro Quebec transmission towers in March last year. <p> Mr. di Mambro 's name did not surface in police inquiries. But press reports in Canada now assert that he operated an arms trafficking ring that included money laundering through Swiss banks. Some former sect members say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Jouret, though, remained its inspirational figure. A Return to Europe, And Greater Power <p> Once he began attracting police attention, Mr. Jouret returned to Europe. During his years in Canada, he had frequently traveled to France and Switzerland, not only to give lectures and seek recruits, but also to preside over regular meetings of sect members. Even from afar, it seems, he maintained his hold over his followers. Once he was back in Europe, Canadian members would visit him here. <p> In Switzerland, the group had rented a mansion and owned several houses in Geneva as well as a farmhouse at Cheiry, 48 miles to the north, and several chalets at Granges-sur-Salvan, a mountain hamlet 45 miles to the east. This week 's deaths occurred at Cheiry and Granges-sur-Salvan. <p> In France, the group reportedly owned a health center on the Riviera and some property near Carpentras. <p> The source of the money to pay for this had to be sect members. There were some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Geneva businessman who paid for the farmhouse at Cheiry where he was found dead this week. But even less affluent members were instructed that the privilege of being a member of the order had a price tag. In Chalet Ruins, Glimpses of Rites <p> This week brought some insight into the sect 's rituals. A hidden meeting room and chapel at the farmhouse in Cheiry was decorated with symbols variously inspired by Catholicism, astrology, Spiritualism, Templarism and Rosicrucianism. A golden chalice was used to burn incense. Members wore white, red or black capes, depending on their rank. A painting of a bearded Christ-like figure, with a rose above his head, presided over the area. <p> The front for the sect in Cheiry was that it engaged in macrobiotic research and, one former member said, belief in the sanctity of Nature was paramount. He recalled that members were frequently required to wear plastic bags over their heads as a symbol of their alienation from Nature. The bodies of 10 of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads. <p> Another former sect member told the Swiss daily 24 Heures that drugs were used as one control mechanism. " They had the habit of putting drugs in coffee or soup, " he was quoted as saying. " That 's how they forced me to sign papers I did not want to sign. We were often given coffee before the rituals. " <p> In Mr. Jouret 's writings and cassette recordings, his sayings sounded transcendental : " I have learned to face death or at least to make it sweeter, more welcoming, " and, " The present chaos is the chaos of reorganization from which a beautiful rose will grow. " ' Cosmic Marriages, ' And Endless Orders <p> Jean-Francois Mayer, a Swiss expert in sects, said at least two-thirds of the members were women and recalled that when he met Mr. Jouret in 1987, he was told that the plan was for " cosmic marriages " to unite " the 100 familes that would survive the end of time. " <p> Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, though withholding their names for fear of reprisals, describe Mr. Jouret as authoritarian, paranoid and at times messianic. <p> He would order, " Wash the lettuce seven times before serving it! Walk on the grass with bare feet! " recalled a Geneva woman who spent two years with the group. " People would obey him like machines, " she said. <p> But as always, there was another side to Mr. Jouret. In Granges-sur-Salvan, where he was last seen on Tuesday buying plastic bags from a shopkeeper, he was popular with locals. " He was a handsome man, " a young waitress at the Cafe des Alpes said. " He gave a copy of his book, ' Medicine and Hygiene, ' to my mother. " <p> Pierrot Jacquet, a carpenter who built the chalet where Mr. Jouret lived, said he knew the man well. " He was full of spirit, friendly, well built, " he said. " We 'd chat or he 'd wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The following morning, Mr. Jacquet helped to remove 10 charred bodies from Mr. Jouret 's house.
