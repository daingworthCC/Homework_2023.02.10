3051541 <p> Governor 's dollar haul not ' clean money ' <p> Editor -- Regarding your article, " Governor sets money-raising record "( Nov. 17) : Reading about the record-setting contributions accepted from special interests by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger made it really hit home how desperately California and the whole country needs " clean money " -- publicly financed public elections rather than privately financed public elections -- and for all the obvious reasons. <p> But the one word that keeps running through my mind is " lies. " The extent of the subterfuge perpetrated by Schwarzeneggar upon the trusting but often ignorant people of this state is mind-boggling. It 's abhorrent and disgusting. <p> Worse, the people who believed him and voted for him still believe in him, in spite of his attack on their best interests, and on the disabled, and his plunging California into massive debt to relieve just one year of financial problems. <p> He is doing everything he accused former Gov. Gray Davis of -- and more. California has been duped. <p> The only way to stop this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, who may not be rich, can have a fair chance to run for office and to represent the people of this state. <p> I hope everyone will support the California Clean Money Campaign. It 's working in Maine and Arizona. And it can work here. It has to! <p> LUCILLE MOYER <p> San Jose <p> -- -- -- <p> Editor -- The fact that our governor has surpassed all fund-raising records( why did we get rid of Gray Davis again?) shows how corrupted our system of campaign financing is. <p> It prompts me to ask what kinds of special favors Arnold Schwarzenegger 's biggest contributors will get in return. Who will win and who will lose? <p> The ability to raise such astounding amounts of special-interest money from a few wealthy donors calls out for a new way to finance our elections. The time has come to implement a clean-money system of publicly financed campaigns. <p> Clean money allows for a greater diversity of candidates by creating a level playing field. Candidates can spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars. " <p> Is n't it time that we stop asking our politicians to sell their souls so they can be elected? California deserves better. <p> ANGELA ONORATO <p> Sunnyvale <p> -- -- -- <p> Editor -- Your article on Gov. Schwarzenegger 's fund-raising bonanza is no surprise -- it 's politics as usual. But the outlandish $26.6 million he collected will raise the bar and exclude more qualified people from running for public office -- people concerned with issues that affect ordinary citizens like you and me. <p> Those who do n't think it 's our place to control the political pockets of our government probably do n't realize that large campaign contributions are considered investments by special interests, because they make huge profits via relaxed restrictions, favorable legislation and a multitude of other " thank yous " that cost the state and Californians millions in paid-out or uncollected tax dollars. <p> And what benefits a special interest rarely benefits our state economy, our communities, our families, our environment or our quality of life, while taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. We need to take our government back! <p> KARLA BEAN <p> Richmond <p> -- -- -- <p> Editor -- The issue is much bigger than whether or not Arnold Schwarzenegger can resist the temptation to legislate in favor of special interests that contributed $26.6 million to him in his first year in office. At stake is the very principle on which our democracy rests : one person, one vote. <p> Only by implementing " clean money " elections, as they have in Maine and Arizona, can we make California 's government accountable to Californians once again. <p> ADAM SMITHLINE <p> Cupertino <p> Amend for Arnold? <p> Editor - The campaign to amend the Constitution to allow Arnold Schwarzenegger( and other foreign-born citizens) to run for president may be the most stupid, shortsighted idea in the history of the United States. <p> The framers of the Constitution recognized the potential for grave harm to our national security that could stem from infiltration of our highest office by a citizen originally from another country and sought to prevent it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to natural-born citizens only. <p> At a time when we are at war with terrorist groups that have long-term and deeply imbedded cells in the United States, Canada and territory of virtually all of our Western allies, one would think that we could see beyond the spotlight shining on one man to the very real danger that lurks just beyond our view. <p> I wonder how eager Schwarzenegger 's supporters would be if a Chinese-born governor, an Iranian-born congressman or a Saudi senator from Boston were waiting in the wings to run for the U.S. presidency. <p> ELIZABETH SMITH <p> Half Moon Bay <p> -- -- -- <p> Editor -- It might be a good idea to amend the Constitution to permit naturalized citizens to run for president. What would not be a good idea is to amend the Constitution specifically to favor one individual. That trivializes the Constitution. <p> Furthermore, I find it disturbing that Republicans, who generally claim to support " original intent " would change the rules simply for the purpose of running a candidate whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They also just changed their own rules to protect House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Texas, in case he should be indicted. Is that their new strategy : Now that we are in power we can write the rules to suit ourselves? <p> PETER PERSOFF <p> Piedmont <p> Message in a cigarette? <p> Editor -- The arresting photograph of the Kentucky Marine corporal is a piece of art( " Dogface from Kenucky just wants his smokes, " Nov. 18). <p> Unfortunately, it belongs to another era -- an era where war was something entered into only when necessary, when the perils of smoking were unknown. <p> A young man smoking a cigarette in a role perceived as heroic, idolized by young men and women alike, sends out a strong message. <p> Tobacco executives must be rejoicing at this free publicity and " positive " picture of a man smoking. <p> Need you aid and abet this message? <p> PATRICK FITZGERALD <p> San Francisco <p> -- -- -- <p> Editor -- Great! Not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more years, but Bush 's illegal and immoral invasion in Iraq has now become an advertisement for cigarette smoking? <p> The much-lauded photo of a Marine with a cigarette dangling from his mouth must have tobacco companies howling with glee. Talk about product placement. <p> Maybe these fighting men( and women) feel their chances of death negate the harm done by smoking. But we certainly do n't need to be glorifying smoking after many years of hard-fought battles to reduce this health scourge. <p> Shame on the media for extolling one of the top health risks and sources of rising health-care costs for people around the globe. <p> NOELLE ROBBINS <p> Alameda <p> -- -- -- <p> Editor -- What could have prompted your newspaper to print an article that is n't entirely censurious of an individual smoking? <p> Are you trying to give Stanton Glantz( UCSF anti-smoking expert) an apoplectic fit? <p> MARTY PULVERS <p> Mountain View <p> -- -- -- <p> Editor -- A Marine is not a " dogface. " A dogface is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leatherneck. " <p> Why does n't The Chronicle have a third-grade boy or girl in a red county to ask about such things? <p> ED GROSSMAN <p> San Francisco <p> Joyride in red ink <p> Editor -- With America 's " acceptable debt " level now at $8.18 trillion( " Congress agrees to raise federal limit on borrowing, " Nov. 19), it feels as if a pack of drunken teenagers have emptied out our savings accounts and stolen the nation 's credit cards and are joyriding with our grandkids in the backseat. <p> I tremble to think about the enormous bill we will be forced to pay for letting those who claim to lead do so with unchecked power and arrogance. <p> APRIL NEILSON <p> Woodside <p> -- -- -- <p> Editor -- I 'm old enough to remember when the Republican Party was the fiscal watchdog. I remember conservative Sen. Everett Dirksen, R-Ill., and his famous quote, " A billion here and a billion there, and pretty soon you 're talking about real money. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his saying would have to be, " A trillion here, a trillion there... " <p> Where is this disastrous policy leading us? I see no good signs. The value of the dollar is steadily declining. The amount of U.S. debt held by foreign countries is escalating. A huge amount of the federal budget goes to service this debt, much of the debt payment leaving this country. <p> I even have to wonder how much the dollar-denominated price of oil has to do with the decline of the dollar, as opposed to the true price of oil. <p> Managed and reasonable debt is a proper fiscal tool. What 's happening now is gross irresponsibility, and we had better wake up regardless of political party. <p> M.H. PAGE <p> South San Francisco <p> Grandmother 's stuffing <p> Editor -- The Open Forum article on buying locally produced foods for the holidays( " Homegrown for the holidays, " Nov. 19) would have met with hearty approval from my late grandmother. <p> She would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaf of Columbo sourdough bread, which she would buy days in advance and leave on top of the refrigerator until it reached an appropriate level of petrification. <p> On Thanksgiving morning you could hear Grandma from the street below her Marina District apartment as she attacked this formidable bread brick with a meat cleaver, a claw hammer and a colorful outpouring of blasphemous oaths. <p> It 's the best stuffing I ever ate, and I continue to follow her recipe exactly, except that I find that it saves time to smush the petrified bread brick with a few well-placed blows from a cast-iron skillet. <p> KURT TRUE <p> El Cerrito <p> Bush 's pick for education post <p> Editor -- In naming personal friend Margaret Spellings to succeed Rod Paige as secretary of education in his Cabinet, President Bush has shown just how little he cares for education. <p> Spellings has n't spent a day in the schools as a teacher or administrator. She has no academic background in education. And she has done no research in education. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close as she ever got to working in a classroom. <p> In short, Bush could n't have found a less-qualified person to replace another inept educaton secretary, a man who called the National Education Association a terrorist organization for pointing out just what a dismal failure the administration 's underfunded " No Child Left Behind " program has been. <p> Bush 's contemptuous attitude toward the work of the people in the public schools is blatantly evident in this appointment of a totally unqualified person to head the Education Department. It is the equivalent of appointing a hospital orderly to direct the surgery department of a hospital -- something the public would n't stand for. <p> On second thought, why hope for anything better from Bush? <p> MAURICE <p> ENGLANDER <p> San Francisco <p> -- -- -- <p> Editor -- Let me see if I have this right : Margaret Spellings, whom President Bush has nominated to be secretary of education, has only a bachelor of arts degree from the University of Houston. <p> So she probably is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a school district. <p> But now she is being put in charge of all the school districts in the United States. Only in the Bush administration can someone start at the top and then work their way down. <p> JUDY TROY <p> San Rafael
