3073441 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tough-guy ex-boyfriend, Clint Eastwood, could n't keep this actress-turned-director down. <p> In 1977, she fell in love with Dirty Harry and became his sidekick. They moved in together( " I washed dishes and I went to the market, " Locke says) and made six movies together - including Every Which Way But Loose( 1978) and a Dirty Harry installment, Sudden Impact( 1983). <p> Then, last year, when Locke was filming the most difficult scene of her second directorial venture, Impulse, she was handed a letter from Eastwood 's lawyer. ##Do n't go home, it said. And if you try, you 'll find the locks have been changed. Clint had kicked her out. <p> " When... you find yourself in an unfurnished apartment with not one thing that represents what you thought you 've worked for in the last 13 years..., " says Locke now, her voice rising slightly. " You wake up one morning and like the Twilight Zone, somebody says, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start over. " ' <p> She was " hurt and devastated, " but mostly " shocked... I never really thought this would happen. " <p> Forced to rent an apartment, she bought new furniture. And she threw herself into Impulse, a dark cop thriller that opened Friday in New York, L.A. and Detroit. <p> " I 'm pulling myself together, " says Locke, 42. " Professionally, it 's my attempt to sort of get my own self out there, and say : ' I know that most of you have already forgotten I did anything before Clint, but now I 'm trying to start over in so many ways, so the film means a lot. ' " <p> Ratboy, the first movie she directed, fell flat. Impulse has met with better reviews. <p> At first, it was n't easy to convince anyone in Hollywood that she could pull off directing a movie. The only credit to her name, it seemed, was Clint Eastwood. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " You can get people on the telephone but what good is it if they only view you as a girlfriend? Sometimes you 're better off being Jane Doe. " <p> But, she says, eating about three bites of her Polo Lounge chicken salad : " I 've had my days of being angry.By nature, I 'm not a bitter person. I generally do n't live in the past. " <p> Since her childhood in Tennessee, Locke has been " in love " with films. Her first role came in 1968 's The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter : She was chosen over hundreds of other promising young actresses and wound up with an Oscar nomination. <p> " I love acting, " she says, " but there 's a few great roles and they go to a few actresses, and beyond that it 's just jobs. Directing is just much more exciting. " <p> Impulse was the right movie at the right time, allowing her to focus on something other than being jilted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't faint or break down or miss a day of work. I talked to her and said, ' Maybe in a way it 's good that the film is obsessing you. Maybe it 's a good distancing thing. ' It seems to have worked out because she 's basically a strong person. " <p> You tend to believe it as she calmly tells the tale. She says there are things she ca n't talk about, yet gives the impression she likes getting it off her chest - that maybe talking about the breakup, even talking around it, helps her understand it. <p> It broke last spring, when Eastwood changed the locks on his lavish Bel- Air estate. Locke retaliated with a palimony suit asking for unspecified financial support and a second house in the Hollywood Hills, claiming breach of contract, emotional distress, possession of her property and more. <p> She filed papers saying he forced her to have two abortions and to undergo sterilization. Eastwood denied all of that. Further complicating things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, whom she wed in 1969 - though she says the marriage was never consummated. <p> The brewing legal battle made headlines until Eastwood took it into secret arbitration with a private judge. " It 's still pending, " Locke says. " And I personally am hoping that it could be very quietly and gently resolved. <p> " But by the same token, " she adds, " if the only way I can have it over with is to become non-existent and disappear and say that I deserve nothing for the last 13 years... I ca n't do that either. " <p> Ask what prompted the split and she says, " I wish I knew. Only Clint can really answer that - maybe it 's all the pressure of having so much power for so long, maybe it 's the pressure of life goals, maybe a person reaches a certain age. He came to that point and I think, unfortunately, the sad part is that it could n't be dealt with in a friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " Sadly, we do n't talk. " <p> She wishes him " no harm, in spite of everything. " And she insists she 's " not interested in a lot of money from him. I never was. My objective has really been more to be treated with some kind of respect. Not to be without my home, my books, my records, my fairy tale collection - everything that defined me for 13 years. I do n't think that 's fair... so I have to go through this horrendous process to stand up for myself. " <p> Throughout the afternoon, as she winds around the questions, she keeps coming back to what kind of person she is. <p> " By nature, I have always been a pleaser. " <p> " In life in general, I 'm a terrible worrier. " <p> " There are two things I can never remember : One is a joke and the other one is specials in a restaurant. " <p> " I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I 'm a quiet person. I 'm an easy person. " <p> " I 've always thought of myself as a talented, intelligent individual, but did n't accept responsibility for myself. " <p> And while clearly struggling to step out of Eastwood 's shadow, she brims with enthusiasm over having molded a movie. " When I 'm directing, it 's the one time I absolutely feel the most myself, the most confident, that I know exactly, specifically what I want. " <p> Impulse took in $ 471,126 on 155 screens its opening weekend. For it to make millions would be swell, but " I do n't want a lot of money, " she says. " I do n't want a lot of power. I do n't want a lot of fame, because I think those things do absolutely corrupt. What I would like is to be able to work, to be able to have some respect, to make some films I think are interesting, to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life. <p> " It 's scary when everything in your life collides in one instant and so much rides on it. It 's like being in Las Vegas and putting all my chips out there and the wheel 's spinning. " <p> She adds, " I 'll be happy if the film goes out there and does good business and people like it and say, ' Look what she did. She has some talent. She has something to say. She has her own style, her own point of view. ' <p> " And then I can be Sondra Locke, who 's just Sondra Locke. And I 'll be happy. " ##
