Ryan on Tuesday offered a full-throated defense of nuns who will challenge Obamacare 's birth control rules before the Supreme Court this week, saying there is " no good reason " to force people who embody public service to violate their faith. <p> The Little Sisters of the Poor, a charity that cares for the elderly poor, says the administration did n't go far enough in carving it out of regulations that require employers to cover a series of FDA-approved contraceptives or else pay crippling fines. <p> " The last thing the federal government should do it make their jobs harder, " Mr. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, said of the sisters. " But that, unfortunately, is exactly what the administration is doing. " <p> After lengthy negotiations, the administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object to contraceptives to submit a form to the government or their insurers to earn an exemption, so that insurers or third-party administrators can then step in to provide the controversial coverage. <p> The sisters and other nonprofits say the mere act of signing the form makes them complicit in sin. On Wednesday, they will ask the justices to fault the opt-out mechanism as an infringement on their religious liberty. <p> In a floor speech, Mr. Ryan said the accommodation is a " fig leaf " that falls short, particularly since the administration fully exempted houses of worship and employers with grandfathered plans. <p> " There is no good reason for any of this, " he said. <p> The case, Zubik v. Burwell, will be the fourth time the court has weighed in on President Obama 's signature law -- the Affordable Care Act -- and the second time it 's refereed a dispute over its so-called " contraception mandate. " <p> The rules have been controversial from the start because some religions hold that artificial contraceptives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pills that they equate with abortion. <p> The Justice Department argues that if the nonprofits prevail, it would set in motion a slippery slope in which objectors refuse to support government policy, then bar officials from getting someone else to fill the gap. <p> The nonprofits lost most of their cases at the lower appeals court level, though one circuit court did side with them. <p> The faith-based charities and colleges say if the government really wants to provide contraceptives, it can pay for the drugs and devices themselves through Obamacare 's exchanges.
