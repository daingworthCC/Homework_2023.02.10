3061841 <p> The sport-utility is the sexiest vehicle in the light-truck field, which is capturing nearly half the total vehicle market. <p> No wonder. Other light trucks -- minivans, pickups and regular vans -- are not as colorful as sport-utes. <p> For instance, minivans lack the power and macho image of larger sport-utes and the cuteness of smaller ones. And pickups have become much more carlike, but are still mainly workhorses. <p> There is a wide range of sport-utilities. The most alluring to younger drivers are small ones, such as the Toyota RAV4, and larger sporty models, such as the Jeep Wrangler and Isuzu Amigo. Older, more affluent buyers are snapping up big, luxury sport-utes, including the Lincoln Navigator. <p> Here are the 2000 sport-utilities with their base prices : <p> BMW X5( $ 49,400) : The new X5 is a luxurious compact sport-ute with blazing performance and permanent four-wheel drive. It 's more carlike than trucklike. <p> Cadillac Escalade( $ 46,225) : This is Cadillac 's answer to the successful Lincoln Navigator. It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The big, posh, 255-horsepower Escalade has a simple, effective four-wheel-drive system, but it could use a third-row seat. <p> Chevrolet Blazer( $ 18,970) : The mid-size Blazer offers lots of room and a 190-horsepower V-6 for lively acceleration. There are three different suspension setups for various types of driving. The design is getting old, but it gets the job done. <p> Chevrolet Suburban( approximately $ 27,000) : This is one of the biggest sport-utes. It has been revamped inside and out and is based on the rugged chassis of Chevy 's new Silverado pickup. <p> Chevrolet Tahoe( approximately $ 25,000) : Also based on the Silverado platform, the Tahoe is smaller than the Suburban but larger than the Blazer. It has a better ride and stiffer structure for 2000. It gets new nine-passenger seating. <p> Chevrolet Tracker( $ 13,925) : This is one of the small, cute sport-utilities. It 's based on the rugged Suzuki Vitara and comes as a two-door convertible and four-door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two four-cylinder engines could use more power. A manual transmission is needed for the best performance. <p> Dodge Durango( $ 25,975) : The big Durango looks sporty and has plenty of room and power. It also has above-average handling. The third-row seat is cramped for adults but OK for kids. Fuel economy is low. <p> Ford Excursion( $ 33,460) : This is the world 's largest sport-utility. It drives so well that it feels smaller than it is -- although it can haul nine people and plenty of cargo. The Excursion is based on the rugged Ford Super Duty F-series pickup truck, but its size makes parking and fitting it into a garage awkward. <p> Ford Expedition( $ 29,655) : This big sport-ute offers plenty of cargo and passenger room. It also has power-adjustable pedals and a new Reverse Sensing System that warns of unseen objects when backed up. The Expedition is loaded with equipment, but it needs the optional 5.4-liter V-8 for good performance. <p> Ford Explorer( $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top-selling sport-ute, partly because a wide range of models offers something for everyone. A 210-horsepower V-6 is among the best engines and is more economical than the 5-liter, 215-horsepower V-8. The roomy Explorer can be had with a permanent four-wheel-drive system, although the part-time system makes more sense in the Chicago area. <p> GMC Jimmy ; Envoy( $ 19,295 and $ 34,695) : These are upscale versions of the Blazer, with the costlier Envoy being especially well-equipped with such items as heated front seats. The Envoy 's ride may be too stiff for some luxury sport-ute buyers. <p> GMC Yukon( about $ 30,000) : This big sport-ute has been redesigned and refined for 2000 and is similar to the Tahoe, with a new body and stiffer frame. The new V-8 engines are more powerful, and there 's a clever automatic electronic suspension damping control. There 's a new third-row seat for nine-passenger capacity. <p> GMC Yukon Denali( $ 44,185) : This is the equipment-loaded luxury version of the Yukon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather seats and wood trim. It 's similar to the Cadillac Escalade, but there is only five-passenger seating. <p> GMC Yukon XL( about $ 27,000) : It 's the GMC version of the new Suburban and thus has undergone the same major redesign. Interior improvements, including larger, more comfortable seats, should be appreciated by luxury sport-ute buyers. Horsepower of the V-8s go up to 300, but fuel economy is poor. <p> Honda CR-V( $ 18,550) : This is the most comfortable small sport-utility, and its 146-horsepower four-cylinder delivers spirited acceleration. Too bad a V-6 is n't offered. It has good handling and a comfortable ride, although it is n't as nimble as the Toyota RAV4. <p> Honda Passport( $ 22,700) : The mid-size Passport is attractive and roomy, and it has solid acceleration with a 205-horsepower V-6. It is nearly identical to the Isuzu Rodeo, but you ca n't use its four-wheel-drive system on dry pavement. <p> Infiniti QX4( $ 35,550) : It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The 170-horsepower V-6 is underpowered, but this sport-ute otherwise is easy to live with. <p> Isuzu Amigo( $ 15,810) : Forget this compact truck 's underpowered four-cylinder and go with the strong 205-horsepower V-6. It has a roomy interior, and it does well in off-road driving. The interior could use better-looking trim. <p> Isuzu Rodeo( $ 18,180) : A strong V-6, especially roomy back seat and crisp styling are highlights of this mid-size sport-utility. Minor cosmetic changes and interior upgrades make it more attractive for 2000. <p> Isuzu Trooper( $ 27,100) : The big, refined Trooper looks rather bland and is n't meant for sporty driving. But it 's comfortable and has an advanced four-wheel-drive system and a very roomy interior. <p> Isuzu VehiCROSS( $ 28,900) : Derived from an auto show concept vehicle, the sporty hot rod VehiCROSS is fast and looks racy. But it 's hard to get in and out of it. <p> Jeep Cherokee( $ 16,445) : The mid-size Cherokee has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is n't terribly refined. But it 's solid, fairly roomy and fast with a 190-horsepower inline six-cylinder engine. Avoid the underpowered 125-horsepower four-cylinder. <p> Jeep Grand Cherokee( $ 26,570) : This mid-size sport-ute is the BMW of the American sport-ute crowd, with crisp styling, an available new 235-horsepower V-8 and above-average ride and handling. But fuel economy is low with either the six-cylinder or V-8. <p> Jeep Wrangler( $ 14,460) : While much improved over earlier versions, the small Wrangler remains rather crude and uncomfortable. But it has great off-road ability and looks sporty. <p> Kia Sportage( $ 14,795) : This small, cute sport-ute comes with two or four doors and as a semi-convertible or hardtop. It has nimble handling but a rather tight interior and needs refinement. The engine is loud when pushed, and acceleration is average. <p> Land Rover Discovery( $ 34,150) : This mid-size sport-ute has a magical nameplate but is heavy and underpowered. There 's good interior room, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle. And fuel economy is terrible. <p> Lexus LX 470( $ 59,005) : It 's terribly expensive, this upscale version of Toyota 's big, ultracompetent Land Cruiser. The interior is luxurious, and it has a powerful V-8 and great grip on slippery roads. <p> Lexus RX 300( $ 33,905) : This mid-size sport-ute has been the best-selling vehicle for Lexus, outdoing its upscale cars. The very carlike RX 300 has good acceleration, handling and a comfortable ride. But it 's not for off-road use. <p> Lincoln Navigator( $ 42,750) : This is the luxury version of the Ford Expedition. It has plenty of power but is quite heavy and not meant for spirited driving. It 's a great highway cruiser, but fuel economy is very low. <p> Mercedes-Benz M-Class( $ 35,300) : This mid-size carlike sport-ute has a terribly designed flip-forward rear seat, but rides and drives well. The interior should have a higher-class look for a Mercedes. <p> Mercury Mountaineer( $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ford Explorer and thus is above average in most respects. <p> Mitsubishi Montero( $ 31,807) : The full-size Montero has a spacious interior and a strong engine, but it 's hard to get in and out of and has just average ride and handling. <p> Mitsubishi Montero Sport( $ 22,527) : The mid-size Sport is a lot more fun to drive than its big brother. It 's rugged and has lively performance. Off-road performance is good, but getting in and out of the back seat calls for athletic moves. Fuel economy is decent. <p> Nissan Pathfinder( $ 26,399) : This mid-size vehicle needs more power than its 170-horsepower V-6 provides, and more rear seat room would be appreciated. But the Pathfinder looks good and is generally competent. <p> Nissan Xterra( $ 17,349) : The ruggedly handsome mid-size Xterra has turned out to be a hit. Based on the Nissan Frontier pickup, its 170-horsepower V-6 could use another 20 horsepower, but handling is good and the ride is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five in a pinch. <p> Oldsmobile Bravada( $ 31,398) : This luxury version of the Blazer has an innovative four-wheel-drive system. There is a long list of standard equipment. <p> Subaru Forester( $ 20,095) : This compact sport-ute 's standard all-wheel-drive is time-proven, and fuel economy is above-average. Ride and handling are good, but the rear seat is rather cramped. <p> Suzuki Grand Vitara( $ 18,299) : The 155-horsepower V-6 is n't as strong as it should be, and there 's limited rear seat and cargo room. But the compact vehicle is handsome and has nimble handling and a good ride. <p> Suzuki Vitara( $ 13,499) : This small sport-ute comes as a semi-convertible and hardtop and is similar to the Chevy Tracker. But it offers a V-6 -- along with four-cylinder engines. <p> Toyota Land Cruiser( $ 50,828) : The Land Cruiser has legendary off-road prowess but is also a very fast, roomy, comfortable, refined on-road sport-ute. But fuel economy is poor, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Toyota RAV4( $ 16,668) : This was one of the first " crossover " sport-utes, built on a Toyota auto chassis. It thus delivers very carlike ride and handling. Tall adults will wish for more room in the back seat. <p> Toyota 4Runner( $ 21,938) : The highly polished mid-size 4Runner does just about everything extremely well, although the available V-6 provides much better performance than the base four-cylinder. It 's pleasant to drive, although getting in and out calls for extra effort.
