3046841 <p> Two years after the Loma Prieta earthquake, dozens of local governments, charities and other agencies are still fighting with the Federal Emergency Management Agency over $ 245 million they seek in federal-state money for earthquake-related costs. <p> About 175 projects hang in the balance, but most of the money in dispute involves several massive, multimillion- dollar repair jobs, including San Francisco City Hall, the Pacific Garden Mall in Santa Cruz, the San Francisco and Oakland ports, and Stanford University. <p> Evaluating FEMA 's two-year performance, critics say the agency has been slow and overly bureaucratic -- problems exacerbated by the agency 's decision last April to halt most post- quake public assistance because of a lack of adequate financing from Congress. <p> FEMA argues that it has done an excellent job, given the magnitude of the quake and the billions of dollars in ruin the temblor triggered across several Northern California counties. <p> But the critics are steaming, and they are many. <p> Brent Ventura, the mayor of Los Gatos, says his city has yet to hear formally that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs for its quake- depleted coffers. <p> " FEMA is a chaotic organization -- one totally unprepared to deal with a catastrophe of this magnitude, and rather than try to reorganize, they continued on their same bureaucratic path, which resulted in Los Gatos and dozens of other institutions left hanging waiting for their money, " Ventura said. <p> FEMA 's performance has even been questioned by state disaster officials who have much of the responsibility for doling out FEMA-approved funds and, under a post-quake state law, provide 25 percent matching funds along with FEMA 's 75 percent share of repair work. <p> " The federal process spends a tremendous amount of time nickeling and diming these applicants to death when the emphasis should be on getting the assistance out there, " said Paul Jacks, manager of the State Office of Emergency Services ' public assistance branch. <p> " There are still labor and other emergency equipment costs for the Cypress overpass collapse that have n't been covered yet. Something is wrong that this is the state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this say about our readiness for the next one? I am not heartened by my Loma Prieta experiences when I think about the next big quake. " <p> FEMA defenders say the 11- year-old agency never had to cope with an urban disaster as big as Loma Prieta. They also say FEMA has to protect taxpayer dollars from being wastefully spent, and they argue that FEMA must cope with a financing squeeze because it does not have enough money to cover grants until Congress appropriates additional funds. <p> In Washington, FEMA experts estimate that about $ 700 million is needed to cover costs from Loma Prieta, hurricane Hugo and other disasters. In the meantime, FEMA stopped giving money for most public assistance projects because it did not have enough to make such grants and also continue making grants to individual disaster victims. <p> Critics say that although the decision blocks the flow of FEMA grants for the time being, FEMA 's bureaucracy-bound ways existed long before and continue to impede the decision-making on agencies ' legitimate money requests. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FEMA 's performance very high, " said Roy Gorup, chief of FEMA 's public assistance branch for California, Arizona, Nevada and Hawaii. " We take a beating in the press regularly, and it 's uncalled for in many cases. Somebody has to wear the black hat and be the bad guy and since we are providing the funds, who are they going to point the finger at? " <p> DEFENDERS <p> Some agencies that have dealt with FEMA say that, regardless of any flaws in its performance, the agency plays a crucial role in disaster relief. <p> Jack Ness, Santa Cruz 's finance director who is still negotiating with FEMA over millions of dollars in projects, said, " FEMA is an agency that people are n't happy about, but if there were n't programs like it, where would local agencies be? It would be pretty bleak. " <p> The critics, on the other hand, feel the finger pointing is justified. <p> Oakland Controller Lance Bateman, who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The bureaucracy and the bean counting is just ridiculous. I have been frustrated, and my anger has gone up talking to individual inspectors, but it just does n't do any good. You end up working your way up the ladder until you find someone who can make a decision. " <p> As State Senator Henry Mello, D-Watsonville, puts it, " If I was to give FEMA a grade like you and I got in school, I would give them a ' D. ' " <p> Here is a rundown of some major projects bogged down in the FEMA process : <p> PORT OF OAKLAND <p> At the Port of Oakland, engineers place Loma Prieta damage at $ 60 million -- of which they say FEMA has agreed to pay about $ 13.5 million. However, the port has received only $ 750,000 from FEMA and has had to spend money from its own financially strapped general fund to begin some needed repair work. <p> The port tried for 18 months to get a clear answer from FEMA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reply did n't come until the beginning of this month, port engineer Imee Osantowski said. She added that FEMA said the port 's request was more than $ 3 million too high, and its plan for the work was entirely different from what the codes require. <p> " We are going to appeal, " said Osantowski. " This is already two years past the disaster. It 's not a timely response from our viewpoint. " <p> PORT OF SAN FRANCISCO <p> Across the bay at San Francisco, port officials report similar problems -- in particular with repairs on Pier 45. According to the port, FEMA 's changes in policy and staff have been frequent and have delayed work for more than a year. <p> " Our major problem with FEMA is that they have posed unreasonable difficulties in terms of processing the paperwork, so we have had to go out on our own and risk making the repairs without FEMA fully acknowledging their responsibility for paying for those repairs, " said Carol Brown, a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked for repairs costing an estimated $ 8 million, but FEMA has approved only $ 1.3 million, Brown said. <p> STANFORD <p> At Stanford University -- where 30 buildings were damaged -- the campus is seeking about $ 60 million. So far it has received $ 4 million from the federal agency. <p> Fouad Bendimerad, a civil engineer who is heading up Stanford 's repair work, says the university is fighting FEMA over whether the agency should be paying for earthquake safety work, and if so, what type of work is acceptable. <p> " Along with the lack of clear regulations, FEMA is represented by private consultants in the field, " he said. " Those consultants have the responsibility to decide what is eligible, and we have seen, in some cases, three different determinations of eligible costs. " <p> SANTA CRUZ <p> In Santa Cruz, where Loma Prieta wrought some of its greatest damage, projects still being negotiated include the $ 10 million reconstruction of the Pacific Garden Mall and $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police, fire and parks and recreation offices. <p> Santa Cruz finance director Ness said meetings continue on what FEMA will pay, and the mall construction is not expected to be done before October 1992. The three public buildings do n't " even have an estimated start date on construction yet, " he said. <p> SAN FRANCISCO <p> San Francisco has not reached agreement with FEMA over how much of the $ 117 million in City Hall repairs the agency will pick up. About $ 94 million is for earthquake safety work the city says is needed to meet existing codes. <p> Mark Primeau, the city 's assistant architect, said FEMA and the city are also fighting over damage to another 190 public buildings. The city puts the amount FEMA owes at about $ 30 million. FEMA has only agreed to about $ 12 million, and San Francisco has received only $ 4 million in cash for the buildings, Primeau said. <p> One of the problems Primeau has found dealing with FEMA is that the agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " It 's difficult when new people come in. You have to bring them up to speed, " he said. <p> With all the delays, Primeau says the major City Hall earthquake repair work, for example, wo n't even begin until 1993 -- in part because short-term, cosmetic fixes to the building were studied and rejected as too costly to be done at this point. <p> While Primeau wrestles with a multimillion-dollar squabble, other San Francisco bureaucrats have tussles with FEMA. At Golden Gate Park, an arch in the Japanese Tea Garden needed rebuilding, but FEMA turned down the $ 386 cost because the arch was a work of art and had a religious symbol on it. <p> OAKLAND <p> In Oakland, city bureaucrats are poring over employee ledgers trying to justify $ 1.8 million in labor costs the city submitted to FEMA -- 30 percent of the total $ 6 million the city sought for fire, police and other emergency labor work immediately after the quake. <p> Oakland Controller Bateman says, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many emergency situations, the individual fireman or policeman or any other kind of city employee does n't have the time to document each and every thing that FEMA is requiring. " <p> Of the $ 75 million-plus that Oakland sought from FEMA, the city has received $ 12 million for fighting emergencies, he added. FEMA has promised City Hall an additional $ 33 million as work takes place, he said. <p> In response, FEMA officials say the agency 's earthquake relief efforts were hampered at first by a lack of personnel needed to process claims and evaluate damage. The Loma Prieta quake occurred during changes in FEMA regulations that caused confusion in processing requests. They say the continuing delay in completing many projects stems in many cases from disagreement over how much FEMA should be asked to pay for earthquake safety work. In some instances, delays have been compounded by the fact that the buildings involved have special historical status that limits the ways in which they can be rebuilt, they say. <p> CONTINUING CRITICISM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the 1989 earthquake, the agency has not streamlined its policies enough to avoid continuing criticism. <p> When California 's Central Valley was hit by a freeze last winter that cost $ 500 million in damage to crops and left thousands of agricultural workers jobless, FEMA was a major source of emergency assistance, particularly for unemployed families who could not afford housing. But state officials said FEMA red tape caused endless problems. <p> " We thought they were slow in reacting to the problems in the area, " said Jody Fujii, a legislative aide to the Assembly Committee on Agriculture. " A lot of the rules and regulations were very restrictive. They made it very difficult to get relief. " <p> Later FEMA did streamline its process, but by that time, many of the families that had originally sought federal aid in paying for housing had been evicted, she said. <p> Those who have to deal with FEMA say that, despite the agency 's efforts to improve its response to emergencies, it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiations with FEMA over reconstruction of Goodwill 's Howard Street store have dragged on so long that city authorities are threatening to condemn the building. <p> " They have their rules, but you 'd think there 'd be a faster track to get things approved, " said Mary Edington, a Bay Area Goodwill Industries executive. " There always seems to be some unending problem and some reason why they ca n't help you. " -- <p> AGENCY AT A GLANCE <p> The Federal Emergency Management Agency was created in 1979 and combines the tasks formerly shared by several different federal agencies. After a disaster, the agency 's principal mission is channeling federal funds into recovery efforts. <p> * HOW FEMA OPERATES : <p> With state disaster experts, FEMA dispenses millions of dollars in out- right grants to state and local governments, private nonprofit organizations and private individuals. It also administers other relief programs, including National Flood Insurance, national fire control policies, and the Civil Defense program. <p> * AFTER A DISASTER : Relying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by hundreds of employees within days of a disaster. In the Loma Prieta quake, for example, the FEMA office responsible for California, Arizona, Nevada and Hawaii went from a staff of 11 to more than 1,000 employees within two weeks. That hiring task was difficult because so many specialists were already on the East Coast coping with the after-effects of hurricane Hugo. -- HOW IS AMOUNT OF AID DECIDED? <p> A federal-state team of inspectors prepares a damage survey report that is used by FEMA to calculate how much is owed an agency under the law. After Loma Prieta, FEMA received 762 applications for assistance -- 330 from private nonprofit agencies. FEMA picks up 75 percent of the tab, and in the case of Loma Prieta, the state Office of Emergency Services picks up the remainder. -- HOW MUCH MONEY DOES FEMA GIVE OUT? <p> On Loma Prieta, FEMA estimates it will provide about $ 629 million in grants to state and local governments and private nonprofit organizations. FEMA estimates it will give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state takes over the job of dispensing the money.
