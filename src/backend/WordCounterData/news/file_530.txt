4116841 The NFL draft has n't yet arrived, and already Thomas Dimitroff has contracted a special strain of fatigue. " I 'm sick of saying, ' Explosive player, ' " he said. # " Explosive " has become the latest buzzword to hit Flowery Branch.( " Process " was beaten to death in 2008, and " urgency " and " consistency " were the twin themes of 2009.) Dimitroff is, among other things, a wordsmith, and the general manager hates it when he ca n't find a synonym. # Trouble is, there is n't one to describe what the Falcons lack. Repetition be hanged, they need explosive players. # In other offseasons, they 'd have found one by now. That 's the Dimitroff Way : Build through the draft, augment via other means. In 2008, the Falcons signed Michael Turner as a free agent, and he led the NFC in rushing. In 2009, they traded for Tony Gonzalez, the All-Pro tight end, ahead of the draft. In 2010, they signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cornerback. # This year : nothing. The NFL lockout locked things down. Quoth the well-spoken GM : " Our incredibly narrow focus on building our team through the draft would not have been as narrow this year.... The last three years we 've been active in trades and free agency. This has caused us to focus even more on what we can control. " # Meaning the draft. The Falcons own the 27th pick. Most mock drafts have them exercising that choice on a defensive end -- - a high-yield pass rusher meets the definition of " explosive player " -- - and this could be one time when external consensus mirrors internal thinking. # Not that Dimitroff is saying. But it seemed instructive that in a 45-minute conversation he took pains to review how defensive ends chosen in recent Round 1s have fared as pros. CliffsNotes version : Results are n't encouraging to those teams in such a market. # Dimitroff : " A lot of teams getting mass production from pass rushers are getting it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LaMarr Woodley with Pittsburgh in the 3-4. " # Does this mean the Falcons, who do n't employ the 3-4, wo n't draft a defensive end in the first round? " I 'm not saying that at all. What I 'm saying is that you, me, our owner and our entire fan base has to be realistic about the production you 're going to get from a defensive end. " # That said, Dimitroff also offered this : " There 's no question that if you 're drafting someone in Round 1, you want to get production and need to get production. " # The Falcons were 13-3 and the NFC 's No. 1 seed. They were routed in their first playoff game by eventual Super Bowl champion Green Bay in large measure because they could n't pressure Aaron Rodgers or cover his receivers. Does Dimitroff see his team being one explosive player from a Super Bowl title itself? # " Because we were 13-3 does not mean we were one more step from the coveted game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team we need to address. " # It has been speculated that the Falcons are working to move upward in the hope of landing Georgia 's A.J. Green or Alabama 's Julio Jones.( Wide receiver also fits the definition of " explosive player. ") To do that the Falcons would have to leap into the top 10, if not the top five, which would be a mighty bound when you 're sitting at No. 27. It makes sense to try, and it would be the coup of coups if they succeed. But we should n't hold our collective breath. # What we should do is do as we 've been doing : Look for the Falcons to draft a defensive end. They can find a receiver to complement Roddy White in Round 2 ; they might not find John Abraham 's pass-rushing bookend so low. # The guess is that the Falcons would be delighted if Adrian Clayborn, the Iowa defensive end, is there when they pick.( In light of revelations that Justin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, it would be a surprise if they chose him.) As much as Dimitroff might try to drive down expectations, the guess is that he 's hoping for a defensive end in Round 1, hoping even harder he 'll become that explosive player. # Where Falcons pick # Rd Pick in round Overall # 1 27 27 # 2 27 59 # 3 27 91 # 4 27 124 # 5 27 158 # 6 27 192 # 7-x 7 209 # 7 27 229 # 7-y 28 230 # x - from Detroit y - from New England # Round 1 : Today, 8 p.m.( ESPN) # Rounds 2-3 : Friday, 6 p.m. # Rounds 4-7 : Saturday, noon # Five players on the Falcons radar in the first round # The Falcons have nine picks in the draft, which runs today through Saturday, including the 27th overall. # A couple of prospects who might be available to them at No. 27 can be eliminated. # Ohio State defensive end Cameron Heyward, from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme and likely will go to a 3-4 team as a defensive end. # Iowa 's Adrian Clayborn would have trouble in Atlanta 's defense because the Falcons like to rotate their ends. Clayborn has a condition called Erb 's Palsy, which limits him to playing on the right side. The condition in his right arm resulted from his head and neck being pulled to the side as his shoulders passed through the birth canal. # Falcons beat writer D. Orlando Ledbetter gives you five players who are on the Falcons radar screen for the first-round pick : # Brandon Harris # CB, Miami # 5-10, 191 # He started all 13 games for the Hurricanes last season and led the team with 10 pass breakups. The Falcons have heavily scouted Harris and spent some time with him in Miami on March 30. # Akeem Ayers # DE/OLB, UCLA # 6-2 1/2, 253 # He was a first-team All-Pac-10 pick last season. He recorded 68 tackles, 10 tackles for loss, four sacks and two interceptions. He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college career. # Brooks Reed # DE/OLB, Arizona # 6-2, 262 # He started 34 games for the Wildcats. He ran the 40-yard dash in 4.65 seconds and lifted 225 pounds 30 times at the NFL scouting combine. # Torrey Smith # WR, Maryland # 6-1, 205 # He might be a slight reach at 27, but the Falcons are looking to add some big-play threats in this draft, and he ran the 40-yard dash in 4.41 seconds at the combine. He visited the Falcons earlier this month. # Derek Sherrod # OT, Mississippi State # 6-5, 319 # After taking over as a sophomore, he became a fixture at left tackle for the Bulldogs. He has good feet and is considered a left tackle prospect, but he could start his career on the right side. # #
