4061041 As a cash-for-clunkers program is considered by Congress, European carmakers say they are worried about the impact of weaning themselves off similar incentives when they expire this year. <p> The payments have proved to be a huge success among consumers across Europe since they were introduced in late 2008. In Germany, they have helped increase sales by about 40 percent from a year ago. But for car companies, living without them will not be easy, said Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive of Renault and Nissan and chairman of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. <p> ' ' The incentives have given us some breathing room and obviously we are worried about what happens when they end, ' Mr. Ghosn said in an interview in Brussels. ' ' We are worried because we know it will have a negative impact. Hopefully, the economy will have improved enough by then so that the impact will not be too dramatic. ' <p> Halting the incentives is proving much more complicated than introducing them. Germany has already extended the deadline of its program once, and French automakers want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2009. <p> The demand for new cars, however, is not expected to improve by then, leaving automakers wondering how they can tempt consumers to buy cars. <p> While Mr. Ghosn said that the American market could begin recovering by the end of 2009, he asserted that an upswing in Europe would take much longer. ' ' I do n't see any improvement before 2011, ' he said. ' ' It would take a miracle for the car industry to see growth in Europe before 2011. ' <p> Mr. Ghosn acknowledged that the incentives could not last forever, but he and other European auto executives argued that other government support was still critical, especially access to loans for the industry itself to help it survive the fallout of the financial crisis. <p> The American version of the cash-for-clunkers plan is much more complicated than the German package. The plan in the United States allows only drivers of cars that get 18 miles a gallon or less to trade in their vehicles. The vouchers will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the car purchased. <p> Under Berlin 's rules, eligible cars just have to be at least nine years old. Drivers get 2,500 euros( $3,462) for a new car, regardless of its size or fuel efficiency. <p> Perhaps because of that, the German offer quickly exceeded expectations. But for all its success, it also serves as a warning on how quickly government-financed trade-in incentives can grow in size and staying power. <p> When it was introduced in January, Berlin envisioned spending 1.5 billion euros to get 600,000 clunkers off the road. But as demand mounted in March and April, politicians raised the budget to 5 billion euros for two million cars and extended the deadline through the end of 2009. <p> As a result, new vehicle registrations in May grew at their fastest pace since 1991, according to figures released Tuesday by the German Automotive Association. <p> ' ' The scrapping plan is only a bridge to get us to next year, when we hope exports pick up, ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Of course it 's temporary but it gives us time. ' <p> Despite the environmental benefits of getting gas-guzzlers off the road, some experts say it only postpones the pain. <p> ' ' It effectively transfers the downside risk from 2009 to 2010, ' said David Arnold of Credit Suisse in London. ' ' They will not be able to simply end market incentivization -- it has to be done gradually. ' <p> Even a gentle reduction of incentives, Mr. Arnold said, could cause ' ' a material drop in sales to transpire next year. ' <p> The American version of the plan is part of a broader military spending bill. The House on Tuesday passed legislation allowing consumers to use vehicle trade-in vouchers worth as much as $4,500 to buy new vehicles. The provision now goes to the Senate for a vote. It would cost $1 billion and Congressional backers said that it could spur the sale of up to 250,000 cars and trucks. <p> Mr. Ghosn 's gloom about any quick global recovery stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flurry of deal making in the auto industry. This month, Chrysler exited bankruptcy, while General Motors started what promises to be a relatively quick trip through bankruptcy court. <p> Magna International, a Canadian auto parts maker, reached a tentative deal to acquire most of G.M. 's European business, while a Swedish carmaker agreed Tuesday to buy Saab, which is also owned by G.M. <p> Renault was rumored to be interested in buying G.M. 's Saturn unit as part of a return to the American market after a two-decade absence. But Mr. Ghosn said neither possibility was under consideration, with other, more promising regions commanding his attention. <p> ' ' We have so many other priorities to deal with, like Russia, ' he said. ' ' We have a new plant in Morocco, we have the projects in India. The priority is to weather the crisis and prepare for the postcrisis era -- returning to the U.S. is not on the agenda. ' <p> Mr. Ghosn said that he had discussed supplying parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penske Automotive Group, but ' ' this was business as usual. ' <p> As the head of both Nissan, which derives the majority of its sales from Japan and North America, as well as the Europe-focused Renault, Mr. Ghosn has an unusual perch from which to judge the global industry. <p> In fact, his decision to oversee two companies simultaneously has been cited by some observers as a model for Sergio Marchionne of Fiat, who is now also running Chrysler. Does he have any advice for Mr. Marchionne? <p> ' ' I 've learned a lot of things, obviously, ' he said with a laugh. ' ' This is competitive knowledge which I can not share with my competitors. ' <p> On a more serious note, he said he was skeptical that all of the current and new companies could survive. ' ' I do n't think the movie is finished, what we 've seen are chapters, ' he said. ' ' I 'm not sure that at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. ' ' <p>
