4116041 The most exciting car yet from South Korean automaker Hyundai is the 2012 Veloster, on sale since September. # The Veloster( ve-LOS-ter) is an oddball, three-door hatchback that fills a niche not apparent to most folks. The small car has a big door on the driver side and two smaller ones on the passenger side. The styling is show-car wild. The $18,000 starting price and 40-mpg highway rating are tantalizing. # Hyundai calls it " playful " and says it 's a " reverse-halo " car -- a low-price model, instead of the more typical high-price one, that casts a glow over the whole brand. Hyundai says Veloster is aimed to attract " a new generation of Hyundai customers. " # It 's also a billboard for Hyundai 's first use of a direct-injection gasoline engine mated to a dual-clutch automatic transmission( DCT). # Ford Motor and Volkswagen also use similar gearboxes on small cars, with mixed success. Veloster 's version, while flawed, seems the best-tuned, so far. # Also known as " manumatic " or " dry-clutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but are automatically shifted by the car 's computer. The driver has no clutch pedal and does n't need to move the gear lever to shift. # The gearboxes eliminate the fluid coupling, called a torque converter, that 's used on conventional automatics. It 's a source of fuel-using drag, but also is smoother in traffic and from a dead stop than the manumatics. # One Veloster test car had the DCT and was aggravating in traffic. As is the case with a pure manual, it 's hard to creep gently ahead. You 're on and off the brakes a lot to keep the DCT Hyundai easing forward. # It works fine once up to speed, though. # The other test car was a base model with manual transmission. It was easy to shift, satisfying the hand and head doing so, and was abetted by a clutch pedal neither too light nor too firm. It seemed to be no problem, either in traffic or on the open road. # Veloster 's manual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage than several other small cars with manuals tested lately. # Also worth noting : # The three-door design is unusual but not unique. # General Motors now-defunct Saturn brand sold a " three-door coupe. " Mini Cooper 's Clubman model has two doors on one side, one on the other. # Veloster 's rear door is hinged at the front, like most doors, and opens without requiring you to open the front door first. # The design gives the presumably hip young owner of the car an eye-pleasing view of a graceful coupe when approaching the driver 's side, and supplies riders with easier access to the back seat as they approach from the other side. # The optional 18-inch-diameter wheels, and their tires with very short, stubby sidewalls, are a huge mistake unless you live in the Land of Always Perfect Pavement. The 18s will slam you hard over even small bumps and road patches. # Standard 17s, by contrast, are smooth-riding, and handle tight corners well. # Space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal for a car this size, but rear headroom is also iffy. There 's even a sticker warning that closing the hatchback could whack taller rear passengers noggins. Hyundai puts just two seats in back, rather than dishonestly trying to convince you there 's room for three across. # Plenty of standard features mean you 're getting not only an unusual car but also a nicely appointed one. # You get a 7-inch touch-screen( pretty big, especially in a little car), power **29;14540;TOOLONG, of course. Bluetooth hands-free connectivity, a USB hookup for your iPod rather than just an " aux " jack. Remote-control locks, defrosting mirrors, adjustable steering column. # Remarkably comfortable front seats. # A regrettable gutlessness. # The 1.6-liter four-cylinder is OK in town, but could n't hold 60 mph on modest hills in sixth or fifth gear under wide-open throttle. Had to shift the manual transmission test car down to fourth to maintain speed. The DCT 's automatic shifts mask that, but it 's still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accent, lost its highway liveliness along the way. # Unexpected highway composure. # More than 200 miles in heavy rain at highway speed never felt dicey. Veloster has the road presence of a bigger machine. It resists wind buffeting better than some other small fry, and that contributes to a feeling of stability. # If all we 'd driven was the base model with manual gearbox and 17-inch tires, we 'd rave about the smooth, easy-going, inviting, crazy-looking car that far exceeds expectations. # But Hyundai expects 70% to take the DCT. And those dreadful 18-inch wheels are packaged with other features you want. So most Velosters are unlikely to merit the rave. # List # 2012 Hyundai Veloster # What?
