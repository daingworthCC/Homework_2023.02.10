3034141 <p> After the Baltimore Orioles turned a $ 45 million player payroll into a 71-73 record last season, majority owner Peter Angelos wanted a better return on his investment and cleaned house. Phil Regan was fired after his rookie year as a major league manager. Roland Hemond resigned under pressure after eight seasons as the club 's general manager. <p> Angelos wanted new leaders with winning resumes, and he got them. He hired Davey Johnson as manager and gave him a three-year, $ 2.25 million contract. He and Johnson lured Pat Gillick, the architect of back-to-back World Series champions in Toronto, out of semi-retirement. Gillick accepted a three-year, $ 2.4 million contract. Johnson and Gillick overhauled the roster and opened the season with a $ 47 million payroll. All seemed well when the Orioles won 11 of their first 13 games. <p> Too little has gone right for them since then, however. Now they find themselves with a record hovering just above the.500 mark and without a clear direction for the future. Orioles sources say Angelos is bitterly disappointed, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired. Angelos has little to show for nearly $ 100 million worth of a commitment to winning over the past two years. And suddenly there 's an NFL franchise in Baltimore, perhaps a major league team on its way to Northern Virginia and more empty seats than usual at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. <p> Johnson and Gillick apparently have waged a power struggle with shortstop Cal Ripken all season and have alienated many Orioles players in the process. Gillick and Johnson were ready to begin the rebuilding process as last week 's major league trading deadline neared, but Angelos did n't want to give up on this season. He took pitcher David Wells off the market and set the asking price high for outfielder Bobby Bonilla. Gillick had his first significant squabble with Angelos late last week over that intervention by the owner, although the two spoke again on Monday and apparently smoothed over any differences they 'd had. <p> How did it all go so wrong? Things would n't be so turbulent, of course, if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 47-52 record since their 11-2 start, even with a 7-2 start on their 13-game road trip. <p> The bottom line in baseball almost always is pitching, and the Orioles have n't had enough of it. Last winter they permitted Kevin Brown to escape via free agency and he signed a three-year, $ 12.9 million contract with the Florida Marlins. Now he leads the majors with a 1.94 earned-run average. The Orioles made Ben McDonald a free agent in part because of fears about the soundness of his right shoulder. He signed with the Milwaukee Brewers, has been healthy for most of the season and has pitched well. The Orioles also cut loose Jamie Moyer, and he pitched well for the Boston Red Sox before being traded to the Seattle Mariners. They decided, however, to retain Scott Erickson, acquired in a midseason trade with the Twins last year. <p> The Orioles retooled their starting rotation by trading for Wells and Kent Mercker and handing a job to rookie Jimmy Haynes. Wells has a 9-10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was traded to the Cleveland Indians last month for Eddie Murray. Haynes has been a bust in what was to be his first full big league season, and he 's back at Class AAA Rochester. <p> " It becomes economics, " Johnson said last week. " Obviously we would have liked to have brought Ben back and Kevin Brown back. But with Ben, we did n't know whether he was healthy. With Kevin Brown, could we afford to pay him $ 5 million a year for three years? We already went over budget as it was. " <p> Gillick and Johnson had wanted to limit the Orioles ' 1996 payroll to $ 40 million. A free agent spending spree authorized by Angelos -- in which the Orioles signed second baseman Roberto Alomar, third baseman B.J. Surhoff, utility infielder Bill Ripken and relievers Randy Myers and Roger McDowell -- pushed it far higher. Yet Wells, Mercker and Erickson have a combined guaranteed 1996 income of $ 8.6 million -- compared to $ 5.9 million for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources, Johnson pushed for Wells, who had pitched for him last season with the Cincinnati Reds, and for Mercker, who had pitched against Johnson 's clubs in the National League while with the Atlanta Braves. And Gillick -- perhaps because Johnson had been hired first by the Orioles while Gillick did n't arrive until late November -- complied, sources say. <p> The Orioles have had other problems, though, particularly in the area that Johnson calls one of his strengths -- establishing young players. Johnson entered the season wanting to establish Haynes and outfielders Jeffrey Hammonds and Tony Tarasco as regular major league contributors. All have been failures. The Orioles tried to trade Hammonds, who spent six weeks at Rochester and just returned to the majors last week. Tarasco, who was obtained from the Montreal Expos in a spring training trade, was the Orioles ' Opening Day right fielder. But he faltered, was demoted to Rochester and underwent shoulder surgery. <p> " Nobody worked harder last winter than Pat Gillick, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great. Alomar 's been great. Surhoff too. We did n't really plan on having Hammonds struggle and Tarasco struggle and get hurt. I love this team. There 's a lot of talent on this team.... But the bullpen and depth, we 're just a little short. " <p> One veteran Orioles player faults Gillick and Johnson for failing to create an atmosphere in which Hammonds and Haynes could succeed. In spring training, Gillick and Johnson threatened to return Hammonds to the minor leagues if he did n't begin playing up to his capabilities, and the veteran Oriole said last week : " There was no patience and no instruction. That 's what young players need. " <p> Virtually all season, it has seemed as if it was the Orioles ' decision-makers vs. their players, not everyone working together toward a common goal. The club let Harold Baines go last winter and failed in its bid to sign free agent Paul Molitor, so Johnson made Bonilla the team 's regular designated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't like the job, and he did n't hit well while doing it. Gillick said early in the season that perhaps the nucleus of the team did n't know how to win. Johnson clashed with Mercker and has treated Ripken far less gently than previous Orioles managers. <p> Johnson, Gillick and assistant GM Kevin Malone have spent the year trying to perform a next-to-impossible task -- winning at the major league level with an aging nucleus of players while, at the same time, rebuilding a depleted minor league system. By the July 31 deadline for completing trades without players having to clear waivers, the trio seemingly was ready to begin adding young players and retooling. Gillick and Malone had shopped Bonilla and Wells for weeks. <p> But Angelos blocked the moves, just as he 'd vetoed some earlier trade proposals by Gillick, Malone and Johnson. Johnson has talked about going with younger players and cutting the payroll to about $ 40 million, but Gillick said on Monday : " At this point, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce the payroll by very much. <p> " From a real young standpoint, I think we 've done a good job in getting people like John Stephens into the system, " Gillick added, referring to the 16-year-old Australian pitcher signed this summer for a $ 500,000 bonus. " As far as players who are close to playing in the major leagues, I do n't think we 've done as good a job as we could have.... It 's going to be a challenge. But I think we 're going to be able to do it. " <p> These are turbulent and intriguing times indeed for the Orioles. Some in the organization say they suspect that pitching coach Pat Dobson could be this year 's fall guy if the Orioles do n't make the playoffs, with broadcaster Mike Flanagan, a former Orioles pitcher, perhaps being asked to return to the job he held under Regan last season. <p> Angelos apparently wants to re-sign Bonilla, who 's eligible for free agency this winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orioles if he receives assurance that he wo n't be relegated to DH duties. <p> The pitching staff will have to be rebuilt for next season. The Orioles will have to sign pitching ace Mike Mussina or risk a salary arbitration hearing. They have a 1997 option on the contract of center fielder Brady Anderson for $ 4.5 million( or a $ 250,000 buyout). <p> In the meantime, the club has pulled itself back into the race for the American League 's wild card playoff berth -- and the Orioles ' first postseason appearance since 1983. " We 're still in this, " Alomar said. " We can go after the wild card. We just need to play better baseball. "
