3033041 @ @ in their attempts to keep fights and weapons from invading public schools, local education officials are increasingly looking to students to settle conflicts among their quarreling classmates. <p> Across the Washington area, schools are empowering students to mediate disputes between their peers. More than a dozen high schools in the District, Maryland and Virginia regularly deploy teams of trained students to smooth the sort of frictions that once landed classmates in the principal 's office or got them suspended. <p> The move toward mediation has not been limited to high schools. Some middle and junior high schools in the District and Prince George 's County offer lessons in conflict management as part of their regular curricula. At several elementary schools in Prince George 's and Fairfax counties, pupils are appointed to patrol their playgrounds and bus stops as pint-sized peacekeepers. <p> " Peer pressure and what kids think about other kids is important. They listen to their peers and probably give them more of an ear than they would their parents or other authority figures, " said Vanessa Collier, the coordinator of a two-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " You are helping kids work out their own problems so they develop a skill for it, rather than having an adult always be the heavy, " said Mary McNamara, principal of Princeton Elementary School in Suitland, where 30 third-, fourth-, fifth- and sixth-graders were recruited this year to mediate scuffles during recess. <p> Most of the schools follow programs similar to those used by courts as alternatives to litigation. Students in conflict may not be forced into mediation, but rather have to be willing participants. The mediators promise to hold everything they hear in confidence and to remain neutral. The goal is to get adversaries to come up with their own solutions and to sign an agreement stating what they will do to avoid future conflicts. <p> Sometimes, the cures can be simple. On the Friday before spring break, Michele Carter, 9, and John Dowdey, 8, were on duty as PALs -- playground assistant leaders -- at Princeton Elementary when they spotted two first-graders pushing each other by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Curtis, 6, had picked up a stick and poked it at one of Joey Nowlin 's friends. Reggie was upset because the day before, Joey, also 6, allegedly had punched and kicked him. <p> After leading the first-graders to a quiet bench on the edge of the playground, the two assistants got the boys to sign statements in which they promised to tell a teacher the next time they had trouble. John, according to custom, then ordered them to shake hands. <p> Although 12 secondary schools in the District have offered peer mediation training since the late 1980s, only in the last two years have such programs found widespread acceptance in suburban schools. Facing ever more brazen acts of violence involving weapons on school campuses -- such as the March 13 shooting in a chemistry class at Potomac High School in Oxon Hill -- school systems have begun promoting student intervention with a new sense of urgency. <p> A local coalition of conflict resolution trainers estimates that about 50 schools in the District and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have peer mediation teams. Nationwide, there are about 2,000 such programs, according to the National Association for Mediation in Education, an organization based in Amherst, Mass. <p> At Prince George 's DuVal High School, student mediators find plenty of opportunities to put into practice the skills they have acquired during 20 hours of training. An average of four or five disputes are brought to the two-room mediation center every day, said Collier, the program coordinator. <p> One day earlier this month, two girls nervously sat in the center waiting for their mediators to arrive. One was a junior who had just had a baby. The other was a freshman whose 17-year-old boyfriend is the father of the junior 's child. The girls had never spoken to each other before, but each thought the other wanted to fight and had assembled her friends to start something. <p> The girls were ushered into a tiny conference room and seated at a round table. A senior helping oversee the session asked each to give her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the problem started because the freshman " thinks I want her boyfriend. " Other students had told her that the younger girl " was supposed to be jumping me. " <p> " I 'm not trying to get kicked out of school, but I ca n't stand people walking around talking about me, " she said. <p> The freshman explained that another student had warned her that morning that the junior was waiting outside school with a relative and wanted " to know if anyone wants to fight her. " She said she did not plan to start a fight, but was not sure how to interpret the other girl 's message. " <p> Collier, who helped mediate the session, asked the freshman what she wanted the junior to do. Without hesitation, she said she wanted the older girl to stop calling her boyfriend and " to leave him alone. " <p> The junior looked startled and said she never calls her baby 's father, then gave the younger girl a list of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the end of the session, it became clear that the two girls had less of a problem with each other than with the young man. <p> The senior mediator helped them work out details of a contract that is supposed to guide their actions toward each other. They agreed to communicate directly instead of through intermediaries and refrain from gossiping about each other. <p> Afterward, the junior said she found the session helpful. " I looked at her angrily because I jumped to conclusions, " she said of her former foe. " She seems like a nice person. " <p> DuVal 's student mediators said most of the arguments they help resolve begin as this one did -- with rumors and ruffled feathers. " Ninety-nine percent of it is ' he said, she said, ' or girlfriend-boyfriend problems, " said Natasha Walker, a senior who has been a member of the mediation team since its inception. <p> Tremayne Cobb, a mediator who is in 11th grade, said that although many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from physical confrontations because they fear it will make them look " soft. " <p> " People will get into a fight, even though they do n't want to fight, because they do n't want to back down, " he said. <p> The advantage of mediation, according to Cobb, is getting the warring parties away from the encouraging taunts of their friends. Although some students initially are reticent about the process, few refuse to go through with it, he said. Once they leave the mediation room, they are advised to tell curious classmates who may be gearing up for a big showdown simply that the matter has been settled. <p> DuVal 's principal, Frank Stetson, said peer mediation has improved the climate at his school. Since the program started, the number of fights at DuVal has been reduced by half, he said. <p> At the same time, he and other school officials readily acknowledge that they do not expect mediation to eliminate weapons and fights entirely. Unfortunately, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably will be the most resistant to finding peaceful alternatives to violence, they say. At some elementary and middle schools, students with a history of behavior problems have been recruited as mediators on the theory that they would benefit from both the training and the increased responsibility. <p> " It does n't solve problems. It helps bring problems to the surface and helps you deal with them, but everyone understands the limitations, " said Pam Latt, director of student services in Fairfax County, where about one-third of the elementary schools have peer mediation teams. " But if you get people to recognize conflict at a trivial stage when they are not so vested in the conflict, students feel very good about resolving things. "
