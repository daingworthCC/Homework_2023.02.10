5024341 <p> No Division I or II schools were willing to give Derrick White a full scholarship coming out of high school. Johnson &amp; Wales in Denver, an NAIA school best known for its culinary arts program, wanted White to play. <p> So it 's no surprise the San Antonio Spurs did their scouting and research and took White with the 29th pick -- second-to-last in the first round -- of the 2017 NBA draft. <p> And it 's no surprise White is a major reason why the Spurs have a 2-1 series lead against the Denver Nuggets in the first round. <p> In San Antonio 's 118-108 victory against Denver in Game 3 on Thursday, White had a career-high 36 points on 15-for-21 shooting, five assists, five rebounds, three steals and one block, and he limited Jamal Murray 's offensive production. White made 12 of his 14 shots near the rim. <p> " Derrick White came out like he had n't eaten in two days, " Nuggets coach Mike Malone said. " He came out hungry, he came out pissed off and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a hell of a performance from a young player. " <p> Malone added : " We could n't stop him. I mean, they had 62 points in the paint. We gave up 16 blow-by, 1-on-1 containment, not game-planning or anything. It was just the ability to guard one-on-one, or the lack thereof. He was impressive. From jump street, he attacked, he got wherever he wanted, and he finished. He was into us defensively. " <p> White, 24, is in his second NBA season, playing just 17 games as a rookie in 2017-18 with 24 games in the G League. But an injury to Dejounte Murray prompted Spurs coach Gregg Popovich to give the 6-4 White a shot at the point guard position. <p> He averaged 9.9 points, 3.9 assists, 3.7 rebounds and one steal and shot 47.9% from the field during the regular season. In three playoff games, he has scored 16, 17 and 36 points. White 's 3-point shot is a work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his defender and get to the rim. He 's shooting 69% from the field, including 76.9% at the rim this postseason, according to nba.com/stats. <p> " I just have a chip on my shoulder, " White told reporters. " This is the way I would play since I was young. I am just trying to get out there and compete and have fun. " <p> This is what the Spurs do. The front-office staff, led by Popovich( president and coach) and general manager R.C. Buford, often find these kinds of players late in the draft. Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, Cory Joseph and Murray were all either late first round or second-round picks. <p> It speaks volumes to the Spurs ' scouting and player development operations. After identifying prospects, the Spurs believe they can turn them into productive pro players after they draft them. <p> Popovich claims he did n't know who White was when the Spurs drafted him. <p> " I never even saw him, never even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ESPN 's Michelle Beadle. " Did n't know he was on the planet. " <p> Joking, he said, " I 've got other stuff to do. I ca n't watch this guy. I do n't know who these guys are. I 'm at dinner. I 'm ordering wine. I 'm relaxing. " <p> It 's up to Buford to find the talent. " And he does it very well, " Popovich said. <p> White spent his first three years of college at Division II Colorado-Colorado Springs after the Johnson &amp; Wales coach accepted a job there and offered White a stipend to play. White then transferred to Division I Colorado and began to attract the attention of NBA scouts with a strong senior season.
