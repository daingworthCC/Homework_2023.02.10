3058041 <p> Daniel Johnston, the outsider artist that insiders love, teeters into his Waller garage and sits down in front of an out-of-tune piano littered with Diet A &W; cans. At the dirty keyboard, he comes back to life. <p> His eyes are wide, clear and focused for the first time in nearly an hour. His arms move with the short, sharp movements of someone being chased. His left hand pumps out a sturdy bass line, while his nicotine-stained right bounces with mischief, stirring up some sort of ragtime from Mars - the kind of music that first earned the manic-depressive 45-year-old an underground following. <p> Johnston stops, smiles for the first time since waking up and says, That 's the Devil 's Eyeball ' theme. " <p> He quickly retreats, slumping into his baggy uniform - a stained white sweat shirt, gray sweat pants and tube socks - and assumes his lost face. <p> He returns to his kitchen, sits down and fields a few more questions, but at this point he 's done. He says he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms wobble noticeably, the way they have since December, after he woke from a coma. A kidney infection had nearly killed him, and Johnson was taken off the drugs prescribed to treat his manic-depression. <p> Johnston 's dad, Bill Johnston, a spry man in his 80s, says the shaking is the only lingering effect from his son 's illness. His mind is clean, and his memory is good, " he says. <p> According to Johnston 's brother and manager Dick, doctors believe the shaking could be either a result of the trauma or a reaction to medication. Either way, they expect it to fade. <p> Still, Johnston is n't his old self. When I saw him only two years ago, he looked large yet still vaguely boyish ; his diminished presence now is unsettling. He says a new album will come out Feb. 28 ; it 's late March when we speak. <p> Bill says his son has been slower than usual in creating his highly gestural drawings, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $60 a pop at concerts. Back then, he used the money to finance his staples : comic books, cigarettes and soft drinks. <p> But since December, when Johnston was named one of the 100 artists in the Whitney Biennial, his drawings have begun fetching hundreds, sometimes thousands, of dollars. Sales of his drawings bring him steady money - more than the recordings that first made him half-famous. But on his kitchen table, a stack of 8-by-11-inch card stock, his canvas of choice, sits blank. <p> Johnston 's brand-new house, built on the lot next to his parents ' home, already smells like a decade 's worth of Marlboro red 100s. The house already hosts a few of Johnston 's little nests of detritus : pens, markers, full ashtrays, random packs of cigarettes, paper, empty soda cans. <p> He 's only been in the house about a month, " father Bill says. It did n't take him long to mess it up. " <p> Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now he 's living both the best and worst days of that life. <p> The same year that nearly killed Johnston has also brought him the fame he 's long dreamed of. An A-list group of musicians - Tom Waits, Beck, the Flaming Lips - covered his songs for The Late, Great Daniel Johnston, " a tribute album released last fall. Then there was the Whitney thing. And now he 's the subject of the new documentary The Devil and Daniel Johnston "( opening in Houston April 21). <p> As if that were n't enough, this month also sees the release of Welcome to My World, " a new compilation CD, and The Electric Ghosts, " a side project. And in June, Houston-based experimental theater company Infernal Bridegroom Productions plans to produce a new musical based on his music. <p> Johnston 's fans all know the details of his strange, mythic life. Born in Sacramento, Calif., he was raised in northern West Virginia, the youngest of five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music, and in 1981 he recorded Songs of Pain, " which he wailed into a boombox with clench-fisted piano accompaniment. The album documented his infatuation with a woman who ended up marrying an undertaker. There was no sheen, no pretense, and there was an occasional guest spot by his mother, reprimanding him for being lazy. <p> Soon after, his life began to read like a comic book. He ran away from his parents with a traveling carnival to work at a corn-dog stand. Later, he operated the River of No Return ride at AstroWorld. <p> His cult following started in the mid- ' 80s when he began handing out his homemade recordings( with homemade artwork) around Austin. He would give them free to pretty girls, or to customers at the McDonald 's where he worked. Austin 's music community embraced him for his outsiderness. " His reputation was only bolstered by periods of drug abuse and breakdowns, fits of aggression and concerts where he 'd mutter on about Satan. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time worming his way onto a segment of Cutting Edge. " His Jeremiah the Frog drawing graced a T-shirt that Kurt Cobain wore regularly. <p> He flitted between periods of productivity( on his meds) and the throes of manic-depression( off them). <p> Jeff Tartakov started managing Johnston in 1986 and did things like file for his song publishing rights. He was never easy to work with, " Tartakov says. It was always a labor of love. " <p> He says Johnston fired him frequently back in the day. In 1993, he dismissed him for good. <p> About a decade ago, Johnston 's family stepped in and put an end to his years of drifting and institutionalized living. Since then, his father and brother have guided his career. <p> Two years ago, Johnston was in the middle of a comeback of sorts, with a new album, tour dates and a productivity absent in the late ' 90s after a breakdown. When I talked with him then, he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Beatles. <p> For The Devil and Daniel Johnston, " director Jeff Feuerzeig creatively fused interviews with Johnston 's family and friends together with hours and hours of Johnston 's own nonmusical video and audio footage. <p> Johnston, says Feuerzeig, does n't remember half of his story. And he does n't tell it very well. " <p> He found Johnston 's audio diaries to be more frank and revealing than interviews with him. It was an unprecedented archaeological find for a single artist, " Feuerzeig says. I do n't think there 's ever been a more self-documented artistic life. " <p> The film naturally hits on all the touchstones of Johnston 's fabled life : the flood of songs, the Austin years, corn dogs and carnivals, the freakouts when he believed people were possessed by Satan, and subsequent arrests or periods in institutions. <p> Johnston perks up at mention of the movie. <p> It was kind of depressing, " he says with a smirk. I told them it would be cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny. It was so serious : Daniel goes to jail, Daniel goes to mental hospital. It was really a documentary about all the cold, hard facts. " <p> Johnston has always leavened the cold, hard facts with humor. Awakened by his father at 11 a.m. for our chat, he scrawled a shaky, three-headed duck later in the day. <p> It 's early, " one head says. <p> You think it 'd be easy to keep coming up with those sayings, " says Ron English, an artist and longtime friend of Johnston 's. They will share a visual-art exhibit at Houston 's Station Museum of Contemporary Art in June. But try it. After about 20, that 's all you got. The fact that he keeps doing it amazes me. He 's got a gold mine. " <p> Johnston 's funny-sad drawings are linked to his funny-sad songs. They come from the same place, " he says. The same iconography informs both, and they 're both populated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly ghost. Through the songs and drawings, he grapples with his manic-depression( heads with the top of the skull removed), his Christian faith and the fight against evil( the boxer, Captain America), his lack of reciprocated love( headless, armless female torsos). <p> He 's a product of his illness and his faith, " Dick says. <p> Over 25 years, Johnston 's visual and aural work has certainly attracted those naturally drawn to the art of a tormented soul. But he 's also entertained a gently swelling mass of enthusiasts who look past its manic eccentricity and find something basic and human in its essence : love, endurance and humor. <p> Johnston 's music ignores rules and regulations about tempo. It includes made-up words and mispronunciations( mediocrisy, " grievances " with a fourth syllable). His pronounced lisp, helium voice and hurried delivery are unorthodox. <p> You can understand why it 's an acquired taste, " says Eels frontman E, who covered Johnston 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnston is a musician 's musician. He 's worked with members of Sonic Youth and Butthole Surfers, and more than 150 people have covered his songs. <p> The body of work, it 's touched people all over the world, " says Feuerzeig. And with no corporate agenda. The power of the music and the art is there for anyone who wants to enjoy it with an open heart, ears and eyes. " <p> Via the Internet, Tartakov, Johnston 's old manager, continues to sell handmade cassettes from Johnston 's early period for $5. Johnston 's family would like to get control of his work. <p> Tartakov also has an extensive collection of Johnston 's art. Much of it he purchased from comic-book stores where Johnston traded his drawings for merch. That 's mine to do whatever I want with, " he states. <p> He also says he 's received some drawings from Johnston, not given as a gift, but specifically to place in art galleries. " <p> Those drawings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuse Tartakov of driving from Austin to Waller on Sundays last year to get Johnston 's art while they were at church. <p> Tartakov flatly denies any wrongdoing. Daniel 's a lot more career-oriented than people realize, " he says. <p> Don Goede, who became Johnston 's tour manager in 1999 and edited a Johnston biography, concurs. Daniel needs people around him, " he says. I keep saying over and over again, he 's no dummy. He 's an extremely clever man. He 's resourceful and determined. <p> There 's always a reason for everything he does. He was his own art dealer for a long time, giving away those drawings to reporters and friends. It 's promotion, the best marketing you can do. " <p> English the artist also thinks Johnston 's relationship to his old manager is complicated. Without Jeff, Dan would be nothing, " he says. Of course, Jeff 's ripping off a crazy guy. " <p> Death turns up plenty in Johnston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all, married an undertaker. <p> The subject weighs on his father 's mind, too. Johnston 's mother suffers from Parkinson 's disease. She 's frail and has fallen three times in a week, Bill says. <p> Several times he talks of leaving something behind for Daniel. Bill says he cashed in an IRA to buy his son 's house. <p> And he 's worked hard to keep Johnston from running through what cash he can lay his hands on. Bill buys art from him, giving him money for day-to-day essentials, and is letting the market create a nest egg. <p> Manic-depressives, one thing they do is spend money, " he says. They do n't know what else to do with it. " <p> After seeing Johnston 's condition, I worried that Bill need n't fret about money, that Bill might outlive his son. But Johnston has rebounded before from death 's door. <p> His family thinks he 's back in the game. Johnston, says Bill, continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My electric bill is always up. Dan 's always up through the night. " <p> He played two new songs for me the other day, and it was like the rest of the world went away when he did that, " Dick says. It was as if he had n't been sick. " <p> Johnston will fly to London for a performance next week, and his brother is trying to schedule a gig in Los Angeles. Dick has n't ruled out a tour, though those have proven fragile in the past, given Johnston 's health, energy and inclination. <p> In the kitchen, Johnston humorously deflected a question about the spike in interest in his work. It 's not that much attention, " he says, smirking. I 'm not sitting here with screaming fans outside. " <p> He looks out the window and smiles just a little. Not yet. " <p> Daniel Johnston 101 <p> Daniel Johnston creates at a manic pace, and his body of work can be daunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind would be disastrous, " his brother and manager Dick says. We just try to pick and choose what represents him best. " <p> Here 's a quick guide to some of Johnston 's work, characters and other projects. <p> The Devil and Daniel Johnston " : Jeff Feuerzeig 's feature film, opening April 21, is a stirring document of Johnston 's troubled and creative life. <p> Welcome to My World " : For newbies, this aptly titled new collection is a fine introduction, featuring some songs from Johnston 's fertile ' 80s period. For longtime fans, there are some unreleased goodies. <p> Jeremiah the Frog : Johnston 's best-known image, this google-eyed creature graced a T-shirt regularly worn by Nirvana 's Kurt Cobain. Johnston painted a mural of the frog on the side of Austin 's now-closed Sound Exchange record store. Baja Fresh, the restaurant that now occupies that building, planned to tear down the wall, but fans rallied to have it preserved. The restaurant now incorporates Jeremiah into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pain " : Johnston 's first recording, made in his parents ' basement in 1980, is Spartan and amateurish. It 's also painfully passionate, curiously melodic and as good a musical document of unrequited love as there is. <p> Hi, How Are You " : The best known of Johnston 's ' 80s recordings. The album 's name, one of Johnston 's catchphrases, also shows up in lyrics, drawings and T-shirts. <p> The Late, Great Daniel Johnston " : A very good primer, this two-CD set includes a disc of Johnston 's originals and a disc of covers by acts like the Eels, M. Ward, Sparklehorse and others. <p> Speeding Motorcycle " : Local theater troupe Infernal Bridegroom Productions ' musical, a collaboration with Johnston, opens in June. The biggest impression he made on me was that he was DIY without being punk rock, " says Anthony Barilla, the artistic director at IBP. He was just handing out his own tapes. " <p> Fear Yourself " : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Mark Linkous provided an interesting sonic background for some of Johnston 's best songs. <p> - Andrew Dansby <p> NOTES : andrew.dansby@chron.com 1., 2., 3., 5., 11., 12.
