3026141 <p> Eye contact comes slowly with Geena Davis. <p> When she speaks, it is in barely audible short sentences. The actress fidgets, spinning a chain on the table into intricate spirals. Then slowly - methodically - she unspins it. <p> Sometimes, while talking, she wipes invisible crumbs with a linen napkin from the area in front of her. <p> Long, lanky, beautiful and Oscar-winning, Davis is surprisingly shy. But kooky, campy, eccentric and off-center - the usual Davis perception? Surprise again. She 's not. <p> " People have a tendency to underestimate how smart she is because she has to deal with that wacky label, " says Susan Sarandon, Davis ' co-star in Thelma &; Louise, opening today. It 's the story of two friends - a sure-of- herself waitress and a candy-addicted housewife - who take to the road after a tragedy sends them fleeing from the law. <p> The dynamite role catapults the much-watched actress from Goddess of Odd to serious player. <p> Director Ridley Scott was n't thinking about Davis when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think of Geena more as an actress very much in the direction of comedy. She did n't jump to mind. " Sarandon 's first thought of Davis in the role : " an interesting choice. " <p> Scott says he reluctantly met with Davis after she called him about the role. " I got a mental lock that anybody else but Geena was not right. " <p> What sold him : " Geena 's very smart - I think seeing the other side of Geena Davis. What you see onscreen is another side of her persona. " <p> Says Sarandon : " There 's nothing in her work to prepare you for what she does in this film. " <p> So do n't look for Davis ' Thelma to be wacky, either. There 's humor, sure. Her scatterbrained character evolves into a high-on-life, gun-slinging outlaw. <p> But Davis pooh-poohs her kooky image. " It 's something that people want to latch on to. It 's appealing to want to put a label on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " she says, bleary-eyed at an all-too-early-morning chat for a jet-lagged actress who has n't yet had her daily glass of cranberry juice. <p> Well, she concedes, her role in Earth Girls Are Easy applies. <p> Earth Girls is one of three films - along with Transylvania 6-5000 and The Fly - she did with ex-husband Jeff Goldblum before their three-year marriage broke up last fall. " It 's something we 're both sad about, " she says. " We went into it with high hopes, but it 's just the way things go. " They 're still friends, and yes, there is a new man, but she 's not naming names. <p> She got her film start in 1982 with Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie as the soap- opera actress who shares his dressing room. But it was her part as dog- trainer Muriel Pritchett in The Accidental Tourist( like Thelma, it was a part she just had to have) that landed her with a 1988 supporting-actress Oscar and new-found respectability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looks for an unusual mix of comedy and drama - Davis chooses parts that " surprise. " So far, she says, she 's been " spoiled, " but she does n't know what she 'll do next. <p> Hollywood 's offerings, she says, are slim pickings. " Most movies are about men 's stories, and women are sometimes there to be supportive or to be abused or used in some way, but not to be a fleshed-out character that goes through changes. " <p> Thelma " explores a couple of women going through major life changes, and the men in the story are sort of supporting and serving our story, instead of the other way around. " <p> She calls the " terrible dearth of great parts for women " a shame. " It 's too bad that the bottom line is the money factor. If only a movie starring a woman could make money. " <p> This weekend - one of year 's biggest box-office weekends - Thelma goes up against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kurt Russell and William Baldwin in Backdraft. <p> With her dissatisfaction, Davis has gone a familiar Hollywood avenue for actresses : She created her own production company, Genial Pictures. - Today she 's developing her own picture, but becoming an actress was a lifelong dream for Davis, 34. <p> Massachusetts-born, she graduated from Boston University in 1979 with a degree in theater arts. Then, it was the model/ waitress/aspiring actress route through Manhattan.( At 6-feet tall, she used to lie on applications and say she was only 5-foot-10). <p> It 's her statuesque demeanor at the annual Oscar bash that draws attention - along with her drop-dead gorgeous dresses she designs with Bill Hargate. <p> At this year 's gala, Davis not only dazzled with a slit-to-the-waist gown, she flounced in with her long auburn locks shorn to a bob and dyed blond. The new color, she says, was " just for the heck of it. " The new length, unfortunately, was n't her choice : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today in New York, in an olive-green jacket over a dime-store white T- shirt and sheer green miniskirt, Davis is void of quirky extravagance. There is no glitz, no Annie Hall get-up. <p> She wears simple earrings, and one ring. Her nails are clipped short and unpolished. Her face - porcelain-white without strokes of color - holds the exception : those red-painted, puffed-to-the-max lips that curl slowly to a wide smile that reveals a generous overbite. <p> When Davis can finally comfortably smile, her liquid-brown eyes smile, too. And when she 's done being coy and is moved to passion, her eyes lock into a powerful stare. <p> Like when she talks about the violent rape attempt in Thelma, the catalyst that sends both women on the road. The unsettling scene was filmed over three nights. <p> " It was a little more grueling than I anticipated, " she says, noting the filming left her bruised and battered. <p> " It 's a really, really unfortunate thing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to want to blame the woman, or make her seem the one that 's being scrutinized. <p> " The plain fact is, " she says slowly, with exaggerated enunciation, " a woman does not have to do anything she does n't want to do, and you can pick any time to say, ' No, I 've now changed my mind and I want this to stop, ' and be perfectly within your rights as a human being not to be violated. " <p> If it happened to Davis, she says she 'd report it to the police. The alternative : " Become a vigilante, and hunt this person down yourself, " she says, noting with a knowing smile, " If it ever happened again, I 'm sure that 's what Thelma would do. " CUTLINE : GEENA DAVIS : ' Thelma ' reveals differet side CUTLINE : GEENA DAVIS : She battles the perception she 's only a comedic actress with ' Thelma &; Louise, ' opening today. Davis calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' hero. '
