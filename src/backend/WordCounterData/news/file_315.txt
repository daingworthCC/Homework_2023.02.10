3053641 <p> " THE AGE OF CONSENT. " <p> By Geoffrey Wolff. <p> Knopf, $ 23. <p> THERE was a moment of optimism in this country after post-World War II reconstruction and the conformist ' 50s, a moment when the economy had boomed for so long it seemed that hardly anything but boom was possible. " " The moon, " President Kennedy said, and people fervently believed it was possible. <p> Riding the crest of this wave of optimism, this wave of surety that nearly anything was possible, was the baby boom. The ' 60s. <p> Suddenly, like the shimmering globe that bears the Good Witch of the North in " " The Wizard of Oz, " the world was reborn, and it was the children who bore it. Or so popular myth wanted it. <p> That shimmering globe of optimism and possibility is the heart of Geoffrey Wolff 's splendid new novel, " " The Age of Consent. " It is the ' 80s now, and on a hot Independence Day in upstate New York, 15-year-old Maisie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water of the local swimming hole and, in plain sight of most of the townspeople, who are cooling off after the celebrations, strips off her one-piece black bathing suit and dives into the water. <p> Her plunge into the sluggish Raven Kill River begins as a swan dive, but she folds her arms in and hits the water head-first. <p> The town and her family freeze in mute amazement. Doc Halliday, carpenter, builder, infectious dreamer - the primary mover of the little post-hippie community - plunges into the water and draws out the naked, nearly lifeless body and resuscitates her. <p> Her stunned and adoring 13-year-old brother, Teddy, covers her nakedness with towels. <p> Maisie 's dive and the mysterious circle of reasons surrounding it become the motivating force in Teddy 's life, and the centerpiece of the novel. A willful, occasionally troublesome but vivacious and beautiful teen-ager, Maisie is rendered a comatose paralytic by her dive. <p> The town - part old-timers, part ' 60s urban refugees looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maisie 's act. <p> Her parents, Ann and John " " Jinx " Jenks, are mystified but not entirely surprised. But they do not dwell on what provoked her. They 're caught up in the turmoil of their own relationship, and the ripples from Maisie 's dive have nearly a tidal-wave effect on them, upsetting whatever uneasy equilibrium they 've achieved in a marriage founded in their ' 60s ideals. <p> But Teddy - a serious kid, in many ways older than his years would suggest - knows his sister, and he knows that nearly everything she did was calculated for some kind of effect. <p> What on earth could have made her do it? <p> His drive to understand is complicated by his love for her. It is not simple filial love, but love tinged with a desire Maisie never did anything to quash. It was a love she even, foolishly, encouraged. <p> Miraculously, Maisie emerges from her coma, damaged but not wholly irreparable. Slowly she regains use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk with a cane and a limp. She moves from hospital to rehabilitation center, and her parents move downstate to be with her. She is different now, and she rarely returns to the home her parents built, to the place that once was as magical as any real place could ever be. <p> In a third-person narration that moves between the key players in this drama - Teddy and Maisie -we learn the history of their family, the history of their idealism and the places it took them. <p> In the late ' 60s, fed up with the bleak urgencies of urban living, Ann and John Jenks left New York City for the mountains of upstate New York. It was something close to a frontier life they were looking for, and that 's what they found among the old ski lodges and general stores. <p> They built their own house, designed it to complement and express their forged, familial personality. They raised their son and daughter in the shadow of breathtaking Blackberry Mountain with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> These were the good old days, when almost anything went and the community got together on everything, building one another 's houses the way other communities might raise a barn. <p> Teddy is enamored of Doc, who though not a doctor seems to be able to cure almost anything. Teddy follows him around like a puppy, listening to his philosophy, watching him build and design. He loves Doc, wants most of all to be like him -self-sufficient, resilient, able to take on any complication and figure a way around it. <p> He likes to listen to Doc 's stories too, like the one about getting stuck in bed with a very hip lady in a poorly designed ski lodge during a blizzard. The weight of the snow on the cantilevered deck raised the floor -and the bed with it - to the ceiling and trapped them. <p> Teddy grows into Edward and goes off to Dartmouth. Maisie completes her rehabilitation, moves to New York and works in the magazine industry. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are hazy to Edward but not surprising. <p> Edward returns to Raven Kill at Doc 's suggestion to teach at a private boarding school for rich children. Doc helped construct the school, helped shape it, and Teddy finds himself good at his job. <p> He worries like a hen about his students, and when 15-year-old Laura( who reminds him strongly of his sister) hands in a paper indicating rather sophisticated sexual knowledge and makes a pass at him, Edward decides he must take action and refers the case to the headmaster, who would prefer not to deal with it. <p> Edward takes a few days off and, with a dark cloud of suspicion over him, lights out to New York to visit his sister and try to get to the bottom of her dive, the central unresolved feature of his life. <p> Resolving that will resolve everything, he believes, because in many ways, Laura is Maisie. Watching a series of old home movies and videotapes in his parents ' empty, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful conclusion of all, and he wants it either confirmed or denied. <p> Maisie, living an ordinary, possibly even yuppie life, remembers everything, and she tells Edward. He discovers more than he really wanted to know, and he discovers even more on his return to Raven Kill, where his divorced parents have finally found a buyer for their house. <p> Wolff accomplishes with superb dexterity Teddy 's revelations about his family and Maisie 's revelations about herself. In their growing awareness, we begin to see The Age of Consent as Wolff 's lament for the optimism of that moment gone by. <p> He makes a case for what one might call " " enduring human values " - rules people live by and live by sensibly( breaking them now and again just to discover their importance) because they are necessary for survival. <p> In the end the novel feels a little strained, as though the author is pushing his characters too far to make his case. But still it is a lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs, the foolishness of youth and the bittersweet regret of age. <p> TYPE : Book Review <p> NOTES : Stephen Stark writes and teaches in Houston.
