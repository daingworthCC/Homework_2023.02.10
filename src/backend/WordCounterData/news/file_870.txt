5025441 <h> Plant of the Week : Garden Mum Clara Curtis, Clara Curtis Mum <h> Sunday <p> A long-standing fall garden favorite is the chrysanthemum, and a genuine beauty is the Clara Curtis variety( Chrysanthemum ' Clara Curtis '). <p> This plant grows as a mound and is covered in light gray-green foliage that has a distinct, earthy fragrance. <p> Its pink flowers start to open in late summer and bloom happily into mid-fall. The flowers are daisylike, with pale-pink petals that surround a bright-yellow center. As cut flowers, they can last weeks. <p> Butterflies enjoy their nectar. The Clara Curtis mums thrive in well-drained soil, and are hardy through tough Ohio winters, reappearing in the spring. A little bit of garden maintenance will go a long way ; pinch branches in early June( no later than July 4) and this mum will grow to be bushy and compact. Dividing this mum every two to three years will keep the clump from spreading too far. <p> See the garden mum Clara Curtis in the stumpery at the Scotts Miracle-Gro Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> -- Barbara Arnold <p> Franklin Park Conservatory <h> Never miss a story <p> Choose the plan that 's right for you.
