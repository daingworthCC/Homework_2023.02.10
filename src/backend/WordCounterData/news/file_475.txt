4062441 A senior House Republican has a suggestion for where to put the Guantanamo detainees - right in the middle of San Francisco Bay, and right in the heart of House Speaker district. <p> " Alcatraz would be a good place to put these people, " Rep of Florida told Congressional Quarterly. <p> " There 's a lot of discomfort about the idea of bringing the detainees in to the United States, " Young said. " That 's why I 've suggested Alcatraz. " <p> Young said he had not discussed the idea with Pelosi of turning the tourist attraction back into a prison. But he did suggest the idea to lawyer, he said. <p> Pelosi spokesman laughed off Young 's jab, saying, " It 's not a serious proposal. " <p> But then, Young is n't alone in pushing Alcatraz. Sen., a Missouri Republican, said his state and Leavenworth prison in neighboring Kansas want no part in housing terror suspects. <p> So, he says, " Let our good friends in San Francisco deal with these deadly combatants. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problems in the city 's Police Department could lead to a vote of no confidence in Chief <p> The latest embarrassment surfaced last week when the current head of internal affairs, Capt. was put on leave while the FBI looks into whether he beat a drug suspect in 2000 who later died, and whether he ordered subordinate officers at the time to lie about it. <p> The department has had plenty of other problems in recent months. Among them : <p> -- The city 's move to fire 11 officers for allegedly misrepresenting drug test results to obtain search warrants. <p> -- A whistle-blower complaint that Tucker bumped police union President to the rank of acting sergeant to sweeten his pension benefits. <p> -- A sex harassment complaint filed by a subordinate officer against Deputy Chief <p> -- And the questions about the department 's handling of the slaying investigation. <p> Put it all together, and you have at least two council members making calls to test the waters on a vote of no confidence on the chief, who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mayor - all this comes as he prepares to give his annual State of the City speech Monday evening, at which he was hoping to praise advances made in the city 's fight against crime. <p> It 's not the first time Tucker has faced problems. Back in 2006, after Dellums had been elected but before he took office, then-Mayor Jerry Brown tried to fire Tucker - but held off at Dellums request. <p> Even PlumpJack Group, the collection of 14 wine, restaurant, lodging and clothing enterprises founded by San Francisco Mayor is feeling the pinch. <p> PlumpJack President and CEO has stepped down after two years to " pursue other opportunities, " according to the mayor 's sister, who will now step into the post from her job as executive vice president., the vice president of operations, is also leaving. <p> Hilary Newsom declined to elaborate on specifics of the two departures, although she acknowledged that " no doubt, we are all going through difficult times. " <p> Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billionaire socialite - a longtime financial backer of many of the PlumpJack ventures - is in the process of redirecting most of his investments into PlumpJack 's two wineries, and away from the restaurant and hospitality businesses. <p> Hilary Newsom insisted that Getty was still fully aboard - remaining a limited partner in all the businesses but preferring to put his money into the winemaking parts that he was most enthused about. <p> As for Mayor Newsom, before taking office in 2004, he divested himself of direct interest in any of the firm 's San Francisco properties, transferring his shares to those businesses outside the city. <p> He may not be able to solve the state 's budget woes, but no one beats Gov. when it comes to the art of the photo op. <p> Take the presidential inauguration Tuesday in chilly Washington, when many of the VIPs - including Los Angeles Mayor and gubernatorial hopeful and state Attorney General and gubernatorial hopeful - tried to fight the frost by showing up in ear muffs. <p> Schwarzenegger quickly pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off. You 're on TV. " <p> Overhearing the exchange, Brown 's wife, reached over and pulled off his muffs as well <p> San Francisco Planning Director and his longtime partner, have been spotted together again. <p> " He 's doing fine and healthy now, " Rahaim said. <p> Farber landed in jail after setting a pillow on fire and hurling an open can of tomato sauce during a drunken night in the city 's historic fire chief 's house on Bush Street downtown last February. <p> The two were staying in the house rent-free while looking for a place of their own after Rahaim came here from Seattle. <p> Farber was ordered to pay $50,760 in damages and went into treatment. <p> Rahaim declined to comment on whether the two were living together again. <p> It started out as " The Vibrator Play, " then morphed into " In the Room Next Door or the vibrator play " - but even the final title has done little to tone down the preopening reaction to the Berkeley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say, I am pretty taken aback at people 's reactions, " said Berkeley Rep spokesman. <p> After all, everyone seemed fine with " The Vagina Monologues, " which Berkeley Rep staged in 2004. <p> Keane denied rumors that public reaction triggered the name change. But he said the play - written by MacArthur Fellowship winner whose " Eurydice " had a long run on Broadway - is facing an uphill fight to be taken seriously. <p> " Yes, there is a 5-foot-tall vibrator on stage, and yes, very touching story.
