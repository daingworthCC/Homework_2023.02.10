4116241 Stanford University 's natural setting is so powerful, and its first generation of buildings so profound, that this privileged campus in past decades has shrugged off every sort of architectural mistake you can imagine. # But no great landscape is ever immune from peril, and the challenge now is to keep the next generation of buildings from treating their historic context as little more than a marketing gimmick. # As many as a dozen major buildings will be added in the next decade to Stanford 's 8,180-acre campus, from enormous research laboratories to a small art museum. A look at several recent projects, though, shows that too much of what has risen on the flanks of the Main Quad is Stanford Lite - a branded veneer of sandy masonry that mocks the robust depth of Stanford 's best structures, whatever their era or style. # There has long been concern about how best to fulfill the vision mapped for " The Farm " in the 1880s by Frederick Law Olmsted and Charles Coolidge. In 1954, no less than Frank Lloyd Wright declared on a visit that while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " what followed was " a confused mass of disassociated buildings in a bastard style of architecture. " # There 's also been progress : In the past 20 years, campus planners and architects have put an end to schools placing their new buildings smack in the middle of view corridors. The brisk expansion of the schools of medicine and engineering to the north of the Main Quad has followed an orderly path. # The problem of late is carefully placed buildings that radiate a dutiful, even cynical, emphasis on atmosphere over architecture. # The embodiment of this fad is the John A. and Cynthia Fry Gunn Building, which opened last year on Galvez Street as home to the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. # Three stories and L-shaped, the design draws on Stanford tradition to a near-comical extreme. A one-story colonnade is announced with two-story arches. Stucco gives way to creamy limestone where visitors might be most inclined to touch. The so-called main entrance features a lone arch at the base of a facade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. # I say " so-called " because it 's all fake, a hollow ruse. Pass through the arch, and you encounter two things : a fire stairway and a sign pointing toward a courtyard where the front doors actually reside. Climb the stairs past a chandelier that calls to mind an oversize wagon wheel, and the airy summit offers no place to stand except the small landing with a door to the roof. # Ike Kligerman Barkley, a New York firm that specializes in residential work and was the lead architect, proclaims on its website that the idea is to " refer to the Romanesque architecture of the campus 's original Inner Quad. " If so, the original 's presence and passion got lost along the way. # Other recent projects are content to serve as " brandscape architecture, " the wickedly apt phrase coined in 2002 by critic Robert Campbell. # The biggest culprit - literally - is Munger Graduate Residence, a cluster of five apartment buildings along Campus Drive East near the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. They 're four and five stories, the top floors disguised as gables tucked into the obligatory pitched roof, adding a baronial tone to what otherwise is Mission Revival with an affluent air. # In and of themselves, the Munger Five are n't bad ; you can imagine the quintet being pointed to with pride in aspirational corners of Orange County. But this is architecture as stage set, designed to look good as long as you do n't look too close. Even the immaculate green of the inner lawns is composed of artificial turf. # Fortunately, the largest change to the central campus this year is much more satisfying than Munger or Gunn. # This is the Knight Management Center on Serra Street, eight buildings arranged around a long central plaza split further into a small enclosed courtyard and a lawn of grass. # The design team is Boora Architects and PWP Landscape Architecture, working from a master plan by William Rawn Associates. The only departures from the basic kit of Stanford parts are a round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the central bays of several buildings. # Materials are kept simple, such as the two shades of precast concrete on outer walls rather than Gunn 's imbalanced ostentation of limestone against stucco. Even the Stanford-red drainpipes are put to aesthetic use, adding vertical delineation to the broad three-story classroom buildings. # More adventurous is an emphasis on sustainability that has earned Knight a Platinum ranking from the United States Green Building Council. The solar panels are just one clue to what 's going on ; gridded concrete panels are layered against upper-floor facades to deflect sun from the spaces inside while adding visual depth. As for that dining pavilion, it is naturally ventilated. The glass-paneled walls can be pulled back curtain-like on nice days - which in this corner of the Bay Area is pretty much every day of the year. # The indoor-outdoor pavilion conveys what is best about Knight, for the design team understands that Stanford 's allure is rooted in place rather than style. Many classrooms open to the courtyards, including conference rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have corners that are notched deep to allow terraces or landings where you 'll find tables and chairs. # Does it also have the resonance of Stanford 's most memorable buildings, such as nearby Encina Hall from 1891? Not even close. But this is genuine place-making, an ensemble that connects visually and spatially to a landscape that in turn exists to be used. It does n't just try to put potential students and donors in the mood. # Planners know the difficulty they face in nurturing buildings that " exhibit a respect for the historic context... without simplistic imitation, " in the words of the Central Campus Design Guidelines. # " We 're working with a sense of scale and place and palette, " said David Lenox, the university architect and director of campus planning. " We want what is built to have the Stanford DNA. " # This allows leeway, such as the contemporary look allowed for medical buildings. An arts building near Palm Drive will be by Diller Scofidio + Renfro, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art Museum. # The trick is not to allow a two-tier system to emerge, where certain buildings are treated as " important " and others have the generic look of the Munger Five. # Stanford teaches its students to strive for excellence in what they do. The university needs to hold itself - and its architecture - to the same high standard. # #
