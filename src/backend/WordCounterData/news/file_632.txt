4137141 AMC rightly is promoting " Mad Men "( 10 tonight) as " the end of an era. " Over seven seasons, change has been as much a part of the show 's DNA as the whiff of a lit Lucky Strike. Changes monumental( gender and race roles, issues of divorce and remarriage) and trivial( hairstyles, music) all have led viewers to a place where, with only seven episodes left, evolution finally must end. When the series began in 2007, Don Draper had it all : a swell career as one of the best and brightest in a Manhattan advertising agency. He had a gorgeous wife, a Colonial in the suburbs, cute kids. It was 1960, a time in America when all things still seemed possible. Of course, much of this utopia turned out to be a careful lie, a re-invention of a man who grew up with nothing but the ability to promote - especially himself. Matthew Weiner created a world in which advertising was sort of a Big Brother, telling consumers what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many, the pangs of need. Sterling Cooper( and various versions of the agency name) was a well-oiled machine where, despite infighting and occasional bloodshed( that season three riding mower incident), creativity flowed. At the start, print and radio advertising were king. When schlubby Harry Crane is given something to work on for television, he balks. TV? No one in the office cares about TV, unless they want to borrow his to watch breaking news broadcasts. Yet as the series moved into the mid-1960s, Harry( Rich Sommer) and television advertising were looking up. While the old guard, including Don( Jon Hamm) and Roger Sterling( John Slattery) were still boots-on-the-ground mad men, pitching ideas to Hershey 's and Jaguar, Harry was off in LaLa Land, landing Sunkist in sunny California. Television advertising would, of course, eventually eclipse other forms of media. Yet today, there is just as much a sea change taking place in a society that increasingly does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or read newspapers and magazines in print form. " It 's absolutely mirroring what happened when TV came on board, " said Ernie Capobianco, CEO of Sq1, a Dallas-based ad agency with offices in Houston and Portland, Ore. " Right now, we are at a major shift in the business as digital is starting to take a larger piece of the ad budget. " He added that clients rely on very specific placement of ads across a number of platforms : " People are expecting analytics to sort of drive decisions. Back in the ' Mad Men ' days, they just did n't exist. " Indeed, a November 2014 report by Forrester Research, Inc. predicted digital marketing will overtake TV spending by 2016. By 2019, according to Forrester, advertising spending on search marketing, display, social media marketing and email marketing will reach $103 billion. Social media spending will make the biggest jump, reaching $17 billion - representing 17 percent of all digital marketing spending - by 2019. Mr. Capobianco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good mad man in the digital age( " Good, creative folks will always be relevant ") but that he has his concerns because Don " clearly is self-destructive. " Television advertising rates rely heavily on Nielsen ratings during four designated " sweeps " period each year. For more than a decade, industry insiders predicted this model would one day become outdated. Thanks to at least two generations now raised on computers and comfortable with social media, companies have had to rethink advertising strategies sooner than many expected. " Our culture is one of invention, and every five years, we do a strategic plan, " said Michele Fabrizi, president and CEO of Pittsburgh-based MARC USA. " I actually had a staff member - this was unheard of - in interactive in the 1980s. Then we started in early 2000 to have what we called hybrids in the team environment here that were sort of digital natives but who were traditionally groomed. " In the " Mad Men " era, advertising had to appeal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; men bought cars. As the program flirts with entering the 1970s - it might or might not get there, but stay tuned - who would have guessed women would have their " own " cigarette and that Virginia Slims would promote it through one of the most successful ad campaigns in history, " You 've Come a Long Way( Baby) "? That, of course, is no longer the case. Explore paint colors or new sunglasses or a trip to Bermuda and suddenly your Internet browser or Facebook page is offering up related advertising. It 's a boon for the agency 's clients, said Ms. Fabrizi : " We can not only customize it, we can measure the impact digital has in ways that were never possible before with television. We can track effectiveness and optimize in real time, changing messages and offers in real time. " We 're going to see even more personalization in the near future. " Google recently announced that subscribers to its Fiber TV in Kansas City, Mo. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test market for localized digital advertisements. Area businesses can place ads that will be " digitally delivered in real time and can be matched based on geography, the type of program being shown or viewing history, " according to a statement sent to subscribers. Customers can opt out of ads based on viewing history. With growing personal messages, however, there is growing concern among some that this data could be collected in a way that violates the users ' privacy. Mr. Capobianco argued it 's not intrusive, and that consumers have the power to filter digital advertisements. " I think, ultimately, consumers will control what they let into their lives, and browsers now are allowing you to set your privacy to ' Do n't track me, I 'm not interested. ' " However, even if you get a percentage of the population that wants to receive relevant messaging as pertaining to their likes and dislikes - and really, that 's all this predictive modeling does - it makes sure what you 're interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose partner, Judge Graham, has a degree in digital marketing, said their agency 's goal is to " take out the uncertainty in advertising spending. " Digital, said Ms. Fabrizi, " is changing the way people spend. The customer is interacting with brands on their terms and in the ways they want. " One thing has n't changed, however : the need to establish a strong emotional connection to the brand. " We 're heavily invested in that emotional connection, which we believe is the key to consumer choice, " she added. Getting set for one last drive down the " Mad Men " road, it 's interesting to note that near the end of season one, Don Draper 's famous pitch for the Carousel slide projector begins : " Technology is a glittering lure. But there is the rare occasion when the public can be engaged on a level beyond flash. " He goes on to tell a roomful of ad execs and Kodak that nostalgia is Greek for " pain from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart, far more powerful than memory alone. " As always, he, and " Mad Men, " had us sold.
