4061541 Passage of stimulus bill <p> No cheering here <p> News that the Senate has passed President Obama ' s $790 billion " stimulus " package along party lines has cheered the purveyors of government pork, governors looking for a bailout of state budgets and socialists who believe that all problems can be solved if we just spend more tax money on them.( Please see " Costly stimulus bill 's size / House, Senate deal will move a $789 billion bill forward, " Page One, Thursday.) Somehow, I 'm not feeling like cheering. <p> I 'm a regular Joe Taxpayer, who has a traditional fixed mortgage that I actually can afford, has n't gone into the debt abyss and wonders just where are all these dollars coming from? While Democrats speak of " rescues " and " investments, " I just see price tags. <p> When Obama said we had to act with " lightning speed, " I wondered just what was in the bill that the Democrats want rushed through before too much close examination occurred. Why the urgency when the Congressional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will hit the economy before 18 months? I 'm guessing that the economy will start recovering all by itself in a year or so, but all these big government politicians can claim that their " stimulus " worked. <p> Of course, these are the same Democrats who wanted " emergency action " when the gas prices rose to near $4 per gallon. Remember the rhetoric? Today I filled up at $1.78. Just like the oil price " crisis, " the current recession would work itself out, just like all the ones before with or without some huge Washington-mandated program. Unfortunately for us, huge spending plans passed today wo n't go away, and our kids and grandkids can look forward to paying the tax bill. Nope, I 'm not stimulated at all. Depressed is more like it. <p> - Clayton Buck, Katy <p> Flawed still better <p> It 's curious that Senate Republicans stood up and saluted President Bush when he asked for $700 billion for Wall Street, then they cried foul to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Americans, create millions of jobs, move us toward energy independence and invest in our nation 's infrastructure. Certainly, no bill is perfect in everyone 's eyes, but according to most economists it 's now or never in terms of acting on the problem. Even a bill flawed in the eyes of some was better than none at all. <p> - LARRY CARNES, Trinidad, Colo. <p> Nuclear madness <p> What 's going on? According to a provision added to the stimulus bill by Utah Sen. Bob Bennett, $50 billion will go to nuclear power plants. Stop the madness! The American people want clean technologies and a bright future for the planet. When will Congress stop sabotaging the health of the planet? <p> - KATHLEEN KAIN, Houston <p> Proof in package <p> I BELIEVE we 've reached common ground. Both political parties deny any responsibility for the mess they 've created in the economy. If that 's not bipartisanship then what is? <p> - JACK GAARDER, Spring <p> No cheaters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proud owner for three seasons of an Astros 27 game mini plan, I would like to say that I 'm sick and tired of all of this fake outrage over steroid use in baseball prior to baseball having a steroids policy.( Please see " I just want to apologize / Tejada pleads guilty to misleading Congress, hopes public will be forgiving, " Sports cover, Thursday.) It 's absolutely ridiculous, and I do n't care who took steroids in the past because under Major League Baseball rules, they were not cheating or doing anything wrong because baseball did n't have a steroids policy. No policy, no cheating. <p> If anything, steroid use was condoned by MLB to bring baseball back after the 1992 strike-shortened season. What better way to bring fans back than players hitting monster home-runs and large numbers of home-runs on top of that? Babe Ruth saved baseball after the 1919 Black Sox Scandal by hitting a record number of home-runs, and Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa saved baseball in 1998 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Gaylord Perry is in the Hall of Fame, and he is famous for throwing a spit ball, which is an illegal pitch. If one cheater is in the Hall of Fame, the rest of the " cheaters " should be there, too. Barry Bonds, Mark McGwire, Roger Clemens, Rafael Palmeiro and Alex Rodriguez should all be in the Hall of Fame. Are their numbers inflated? Probably so, but their numbers are so astronomical they would still have Hall of Fame numbers if stats were taken away from them. <p> I blame MLB and the commissioners office for the Steroids Era, but it happened. All players who used steroids before the new steroids policy was implemented should step forward, and they should all be forgiven. Now, baseball has a steroids policy, and now, it is cheating. Players caught using steroids today should be suspended, banned from baseball and banned from the Hall of Fame, but players of the Steroid Era should be given a pass because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> - Joseph R. Pellerin, Texas City <p>..... and no morality, either <p> So, let me get this straight : If you lie in business and you get caught at it, your career suffers. If you 're an Astro and you get caught lying to Congress, your career prospers. I guess morality is truly dead. <p> - Travis Gillis, Humble <p> Are we safe from asteroids? <p> In response to Thursday 's Page One article " A first for space : Satellites collide " : Can we not escape the dinosaur 's fate? Surely the multimillion-dollar Iridium satellites have thruster capability. If we can not even track orbits of our own Earth satellites and space junk, then what are the chances of detecting a collision of Earth with other junk such as a mass-extinction and planet-killing near-Earth object asteroid? <p> - ED SUTTON, Stillwater, Okla. <p> Belated, but not forgotten <p> In response to Thursday 's Chronicle, someone else deserves recognition on his 200th birthday. An editorial and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Darwin, while the bicentennial birthday of the great American President Abraham Lincoln was noticeably absent. To further the point, the front page of the Chronicle prominently celebrated the 100th anniversary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Abraham Lincoln!
