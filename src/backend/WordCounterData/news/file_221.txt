3042141 <p> The U.S. successfully completed its next-to-last Olympics tuneup by winning the Championships of the Americas last weekend in Mexico City. The U.S. men - Rod White, Butch Johnson and Justin Huish - finished first, second and third, respectively, in the men 's recurve( Olympic) bow competition. Lindsay Langston, 17, of the U.S. finished second in women 's competition, while teammates Janet Dykman and Judi Adams finished fourth and fifth, respectively. In team competition, the U.S. men won the gold over Canada 234-218, while the women defeated Mexico 233-215. The team 's last challenge before the Olympics is the Tournament of Nations May 30- June 2 in Germany. <p> BADMINTON <p> In what is likely to be a preview of the Olympics, the best players from three Asian countries and one European nation face off in the Thomas and Uber Cup semifinals in Hong Kong. Indonesia, the defending world champion in men 's and women 's competition, faces South Korea and China goes against Denmark, which made the semifinals for the first time since 1990. Malaysia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since 1984. The tournament continues through Sunday. <p> BASEBALL <p> Lourdes Gurriel, Orlando Hernandez, German Mesa and Victor Mesa were dropped from Cuba 's Olympic roster. Most surprising was Hernandez, who was projected as Cuba 's No. 2 starter. Team officials cited an elbow injury, but it is believed Hernandez was considered too great a threat to defect. Hernandez 's brother, Livan, defected last summer and eventually signed a $ 4.5 million deal with the Florida Marlins. Victor Mesa was unimpressive during last summer 's four-game series against Team USA and Gurriel, a designated hitter, is listed as 39. However, German Mesa was considered to carry a major-league glove at shortstop. It is n't known whether the moves are permanent. Olympic rosters are n't set until July 6. <p> BASKETBALL <p> U.S. women 's assistant Nell Fortner, who was named coach at Purdue University recently, will help carry the Olympic torch. Fortner will take part in the relay June 4 from Gary, Ind., to Indianapolis. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistant, will serve as director for the inaugural tryouts for the American Basketball League, a women 's professional league set to begin play in October. Brown will run drills and coach scrimmages Tuesday through June 2 at Emory University. <p> BEACH VOLLEYBALL <p> The ball that will be used in the Olympics is taking some getting used to, the Americans say. It is lighter than the one on the U.S. tours, making it harder to jump-serve and control. " The ball is not a great ball, " Karch Kiraly of the U.S. said of the international sphere. " That is one of the ways the international teams will have an advantage. " The players of the AVP, the American men 's pro beach tour, also will have to get used to the international rules that apply to sets. The AVP does not allow set balls to spin. On the international tour, what constitutes a good set is more lax, allowing for more rallies. " I guess we 'll just have to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " Kiraly said. <p> BOXING <p> It matters little that light heavyweight Antonio Tarver did not look sharp in an exhibition win over German Thomas Ulrich last week in Portland, Ore. But Olympic assistant coach Jesse Ravelo did n't hide his feelings. " He fought a tough guy but he needs to be more aggressive and not so timid with his punches, " Ravelo said. " He needs some work, but he is capable. He 'll be OK. "... Twelve Olympic team members and 12 alternates open their second stage of training camp today at Northern Michigan University. The Red and Blue squads will spend two weeks at NMU( the home base of Olympic coach Al Mitchell), then split up again for two exhibitions against Russia( June 14 in Portland, Ore. ; June 17 in Miami). The Olympians will open their final two-week camp June 25 in Augusta. <p> CANOE/KAYAK <p> It did n't make up for missing the Olympic team, but on the second day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lecky Haller showed why they are among the best. Because the U.S. had only one doubles canoe berth, the winner of Saturday 's race went to the Olympics. In an upset, the Glencoe, Md., natives lost to Horace Holden and Wayne Dickert of Bryson City, N.C. On Sunday, the Hallers came back and smoked Holden and Dickert, beating them by almost 13 seconds. By winning the Sunday race, the Hallers earned " second boat " position on the U.S. team, meaning they are first Olympic alternate and eligible to race in the 1996 Slalom World Cup series. <p> CYCLING <p> Some members of the U.S. Olympic team will spend early July training in Birmingham. That city is considered a good place to get cyclists acclimated to Southern heat and humidity, but away from Atlanta 's crowds in the last weeks before the Games. Mountain bikers, road bikers and track bikers all will be invited, although some members of the track team plan to spend their final training weeks in Indianapolis at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the same humidity as Atlanta, and is almost as hot.... Former world champion match pursuiter Marty Nothstein says he can get his track bike up to 45 mph on his own, and up to 55 mph when he 's riding behind a pace motorcycle on a banked oval. " I 'm catching some G-force going through the turns, sometimes to the point where it scares me, " said Nothstein, a native of Trexlertown, Pa., where the Olympic track cycling trials will be held June 4- 9. <p> DIVING <p> A preview of the U.S. Olympic trials is beginning in Atlanta today, but it 's not open to the public. Top U.S. divers attended a training camp this week at the Georgia Tech Aquatic Center, and are staging an informal contest this weekend to help them get used to the facility. The trials begin June 19 in Indianapolis, with 46 athletes vying for eight spots on the team. <p> EQUESTRIAN <p> Michelle Gibson of Roswell tops the list of contenders for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training in Germany, won the Grand Prix and the Grand Prix Freestyle in Munich, Germany, last weekend with scores of 72.4 and 77.32 aboard Peron. While most of the American riders have competed this spring in trials in the United States, events in Germany have served as Gibson 's qualifiers. Last weekend marked the end of the qualifiers for the dressage finals, and the top 12 horses and riders will compete against one another at the final Olympic selection trial, which begins June 15 in Gladstone, N.J. <p> FENCING <p> Atlanta 's Nhi Lan Le will battle for the third slot on the U.S. women 's Olympic epee team at the World Cup in Italy this weekend. " I 'm ahead at the moment, " Le said. " I 'm No. 3. It looks really good. " Le, who switched from foil this year, has amazed even herself with her meteoric rise. At first she reasoned she would give making the team her best shot. But then as her results got better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am going to do it ; this is the path I have drawn, " she said. " I spent half my life training for this and I 've just got to do it. " Leslie Marx and Elaine Cheris are the No. 1-and No. 2-ranked U.S. women 's epee fencers. The U.S. fencing team, based on points earned at World Cup events, will be announced during the national championships next month. <p> FIELD HOCKEY <p> Shortly after cutting their roster to 16 for the Olympics, the U.S. women began what coach Pam Hixon calls the " mental training " aspect of final preparations. The team traveled to U.S. Field Hockey Association headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colo., to attend a seminar given by the Center for Sports Psychology. " Since we had 23 players in camp for so long, we thought it was important to come together with a new attitude and a new approach for this new group, " Hixon said. " We wanted to retrain our minds to deal with the changes we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still the same. " The women are back working out at Clark Atlanta University until June 9, when they leave for the U.S. training complex in Chula Vista, Calif., for three weeks. The men 's team has been in residence there for several months. Both teams will come to Atlanta in early July. <p> GYMNASTICS <p> Forget worries about Dominique Moceanu 's nagging heel injury. The 14- year-old was easily the top competitor at the U.S. Classic last weekend in Colorado Springs. Moceanu wowed the crowd at the Olympic Training Center with a 9.8 score on a flawless beam routine in the compulsories. She withdrew from the optionals, as did Shannon Miller, Kerri Strug, Dominique Dawes and a host of Olympic hopefuls who only entered the meet to brush up on compulsory routines. Winner of the two-day event was Jennie Thompson, also on the rebound from a foot injury. Thompson, of Wichita Falls, Texas, posted the highest scores on vault, beam and floor exercise. Failing to impress was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ botched her bars routine with an incomplete transition from low to high bar. The weekend was big for Cincinnati 's Amanda Borden, who, because of injury, needed to place in the top 12 to qualify for the U.S. nationals in two weeks. She finished second to Thompson and remains a contender for the Olympic team after missing nearly a year of competition because of an injury. <p> JUDO <p> Going for the gold does not come cheap. Celita Schutz, captain of the U.S. Olympic women 's team, gave up her $ 50,000-a-year art design career to train all-out for the Games. Schutz, 27, hired a nutritionist to help her stay trim for the 134-pound weight division and a sports psychologist to help her focus. The Hillsdale, N.J., resident is no stranger to self-sacrifice and hard work. She won her Olympic slot in January six months after breaking her leg during a tournament in Brazil. <p> MODERN PENTATHLON <p> Jim Gregory and coach Jan Bartu left this week for Rome and the final Olympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven finishers earning Olympic berths. Even if Gregory falls short, there 's still one more chance. There are two wild-card openings remaining and the U.S. might get one. Wild cards probably wo n't be named until next month, and by then, Gregory, Michael Gostigian( already qualified) and Scott Cristie will be in Europe to compete in tuneup qualifiers - Cristie and Gregory in Bern, Switzerland, and Prague, Czech Republic, and Gostigian at Prague. <p> RHYTHMIC GYMNASTICS <p> So why should the U.S. group team be so excited about a last-place finish at the 3M-Grand Prix International Tournament? For starters, they made only minor mistakes. " It was cold and rainy the whole week, but the situation in the gym was like opposite of the weather, " said coach Rossitaz Todorova. " The girls mobilized all their skills. They focused very well. " Moreover, Todorova says the sixth place " is not real, " given that the European judges have had practically no exposure to the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confuse and delight them. She said the U.S. team, which includes Kennesaw 's Becky Turner, was easily on par with Italy and France, which placed third and fourth, respectively, and " 100 percent better " than Germany, which took fifth. <p> ROWING <p> A number of experienced reserves have been selected for the U.S. Olympic team. Two of the 10 are 1992 Olympians - Jim Neil and Chris Swan. They rowed together during the 1995 World Championships but did n't win a medal. Chris Kerber was a world champion in the lightweight men 's four in 1993. Olympic reserves will not stay in the Olympic Village because the rowing team is the second largest for the U.S. in the Games and officials are trying to limit the number in the village. <p> SHOOTING <p> The first medal of the Olympics will come from the women 's 10-meter air rifle competition July 20, where the U.S. has a good shot at being among the Games ' first three medalists. Nancy Napolski and Elizabeth Bourland will represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @... The U.S. pistol, rifle and running target Olympic teams left Thursday for European World Cup events in Munich, Germany( Sunday- Thursday), and Milan, Italy( June 1-7). The shotgun team will travel to Lonato, Italy( June 3-7), and Shul, Germany( June 9-15), for its last pre- Olympic competitions. The Olympic shooters, having already qualified for next year 's national championships, will skip this year 's nationals, USA Shooting 's Nancy Moore said. <p> SOCCER <p> A gold medal may not be a sure thing, as Tony DiCicco insists, but the coach of the U.S. women 's team has a lot to smile about. The team just completed a four-game tournament in which it did n't allow a goal. In fact, it has recorded nine shutout victories in 17 games this year and has defeated every other team coming to the Olympics. The team 's only 1996 loss was against Norway, which split a two-game series with the U.S in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set, midfielder Amanda Cromwell, who 's been recovering from a knee injury, will get another shot at making the Olympic squad. <p> SOFTBALL <p> The Opening Ceremonies are in Atlanta, but Columbus is bringing its Olympic sport to town with a bash of its own. Columbus ' welcome ceremony will be July 20, the night before the first-ever pitch of Olympic softball competition. The ceremony, to be held at the city 's Memorial Stadium, includes fireworks, the showing of a film called " Faces of Columbus " and appearances by the Columbus Symphony Orchestra, Up With People and singer Peabo Bryson. Games begin July 21 at Golden Park. <p> SWIMMING <p> Olympian Cristina Teuscher has turned down scholarship offers from Stanford, Southern Cal and Southern Methodist in order to stay close to home. Teuscher, of New Rochelle, N.Y., will attend Columbia University, which, as a member of the Ivy League, does not give scholarships. By declining a scholarship, she leaves the door open to accept prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A U.S. swimmer winning an individual gold medal can earn $ 65,000. If she takes the money, she can not compete collegiately, according to NCAA rules. Teuscher will continue to train with the Badger Swim Club and coach John Collins. She is the World Championships silver medalist in the 400-meter freestyle and also qualified for the Olympic team in the 200 freestyle and both freestyle relays. <p> SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING <p> And the winner is... Canada. They may be No. 2 in the world in the pool, but the Canadian squad is first on the information super- waterway. Since launching the team 's home page on the World Wide Web a little over a month ago, the response has been " amazing " said Danielle Emond of governing body Synchro Canada. Featuring team photos and bios, facts and technical descriptions - even a schedule of team appearances through the Games - the page averages about 20 " hits " a day, not including e-mailed questions and personal messages. The address is http : **34;1292;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team is without a coach. Zhang Li, a former top player and coach from Xinxang, China, has been the U.S. women 's coach for five years and coached the women 's team in Barcelona during the 1992 Games. She resigned last week for personal reasons, team leader Bob Fox said. Zhang, 45, is married to Li Zhenshi, who coaches the U.S. men 's Olympic team. He will remain in that position, Fox said. The couple live in Colorado Springs. The USA Table Tennis association has recommended replacing Zhang with John Bosika, a native of Romania, Fox said. The recommendation will be submitted soon to the U.S. Olympic Committee. Bosika was a coach in Yugoslavia before moving to the U.S. a few years ago. He coaches at the national table tennis training center in Davison, Mich. <p> TEAM HANDBALL <p> Nearly three years ago, Chip Van Os was working as a certified public account in Houston when he and a friend watched a team handball match at the Olympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to play in a weekend tournament. There, Van Os was " discovered " by a U.S. official. Now, he 's an Olympian. " We did n't know the rules, we did n't know what we were doing, " said Van Os, a reserve backcourt player for the U.S. <p> TENNIS <p> The French Open begins Monday and while you are watching TV or reading reports, do n't be surprised to see a lot of Olympic references. Nations have been considering their choices of players to represent them in Atlanta and, although they have until May 31 to name their teams, most have been waiting for the French Open to get maximum exposure for the players and their national tennis federations. <p> TRACK AND FIELD <p> World champion Donovan Bailey, a favorite in the Olympic 100 meters, has been bothered recently by pain from a degenerative hip condition.... Bailey ranks among the few not surprised by the solid early-season showing of Carl Lewis. " It 's an Olympic year and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy for the Olympics, " Bailey said. " With the Olympics being in America and this being his last go at it, Carl is going to be kicking butt. "... Perhaps the marquee distance race of the season could take place late this summer at the Grand Prix Finals, matching Haile Gebrselassie and Noureddine Morceli in the 3,000 meters. Both are world record-holders in their respective events, but Morceli would move up from the 1,500 meters and Gebrselassie down from the 5,000.... Dan O'Brien was delighted that meet organizers put together a three- event competition for decathletes last weekend at the Atlanta Grand Prix. " I begged them to have a pole vault, " said O'Brien, who failed to make the 1992 team when he did n't clear a height in the pole vault. " I was the only guy that did n't vault in New Orleans before the trials. I did n't want to come into the trials here cold. "... Jackie Joyner-Kersee scratched from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her right calf. The discomfort came after she long jumped for the first time in almost a year. " There was no sense challenging an injury this close to trials, " said Bobby Kersee, her husband/coach. <p> VOLLEYBALL <p> Two-time Olympian Bob Ctvrtlik, captain of the U.S. men 's team, will be making every spike count twice during the Olympics. He 's going to be working with the Make-a-Wish Foundation to raise money while, he hopes, bringing home a gold medal. Ctvrtlik, an outside hitter regarded as one of the best receivers in the world, will be running a spike-a-thon, asking supporters to donate 50 cents for every ball he spikes during matches - usually anywhere from 10 to 20 spikes. Interested people may pledge on QVC, a home shopping network. Kaepa and Champion, two of the official sponsors of USA Volleyball, are helping publicize the efforts with Ctvrtlik, who says, " I just want to give something back. " His commitment to charitable causes prompted Ctvrtlik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money for nonprofit groups. <p> WATER POLO <p> U.S. scoring leader Chris Humbert recently revealed his dietary regimen : a pack of convenience store doughnut gems for breakfast, fast- food burgers later on, a steak before games. But captain and goalie Chris Duplanty says his own diet is " at the other end of the spectrum, " evening out a training table that 's remarkably unsupervised for a team in such a demanding sport. <p> WEIGHTLIFTING <p> Although his performance at the U.S. trials ranked 10th best, superheavyweight Kevin Coleman was bumped from the 10-man team because nations are limited to two lifters per class, and superheavyweights Mark Henry and Thomas Ingalsbe qualified ahead of him. But Coleman 's Olympic hopes are still alive. Also a world-class shot-putter, Coleman qualified for the track and field trials by throwing 65 feet, 8 1/4 inches at the UTEP Invitational last month. Coleman, who did n't begin competitive weightlifting until September, said he may continue with the sport. " I 'll just have to play it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it. I have a lot of technique work to do, so I 'll see what I can do. I need the repetitions. " <p> WRESTLING <p> The IOC has granted 19 freestyle and 17 Greco-Roman wild-card entries into the Olympics. The wild cards are awarded on the recommendation of FILA, the world governing body, and are intended partly to allow countries with little wrestling tradition a chance to be represented. For example, Francisco Iglesias received a freestyle berth at 180 1/2 pounds as Spain 's only competitor in either freestyle or Greco- Roman. Other wrestlers got in for other reasons. Elmadi Jabrilov, a 1989 freestyle world champion who was Olympic silver medalist in ' 92 and world silver medalist last summer, was one of five Kazakhstan athletes too late for weigh-ins at the Asian qualifiers. Kazakhstan applied for a wild card for Jabrilov and got one. So did Cuba 's Hector Milan, the defending Olympic champion at 220 pounds in freestyle, and Japan 's Sanshiro Abe at 136 1/2 in freestyle. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won the Finn dinghy berth on the U.S. sailing team was that he did n't want to race in many European regattas before the Olympics. " It 's cold over there, " the Charleston, S.C., native said. " In one regatta it started hailing and I raced with little balls of hail rolling around in my boat. " Martin was n't alone in skipping prestigious European events. So few sailors showed up at a regatta near Copenhagen, Denmark, that racing was canceled in four of the 10 Olympic divisions. <p> PARALYMPICS <p> Jennifer Barrett set two world records for single arm amputees at the U.S. Track and Field Trials. She threw the discus 126 feet, 3 inches( 38.48 meters) and the shot put 35-11( 10.95 meters). Tony Volpentest, a double amputee, bettered his own mark in the 100 meters with a time of 11.46 seconds.
