3004141 <p> As census forms are filled out in households around the country this weekend, the nation 's residents are writing an end to a decennial demographic contest that has more winners and losers than ever before. <p> California wants to know if it gained six Congressional seats or seven ; Pennsylvania wants to know if it lost two or three. New Jersey towns want to know local population figures so they can determine how many liquor licenses to issue. Oklahoma City and Rochester want to know if they have lost their places among the top 50 metropolitan markets, meaning millions of advertising dollars would go elsewhere. <p> As the winners and losers have increased, so have the legal and political pressures on the Bureau of the Census, the agency that keeps the score. It has forced politicians, the bureau and professional statisticians around the country to re-examine basic questions : What demographic information should the Government gather? How should it be gathered? And to what end? <p> Census figures have always been the basis of Congressional reapportionment, but not until the 1970 census was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for redrawing state legislatures ' districts. By 1980, as Federal revenue sharing programs based on population grew, census figures were used to apportion large amounts of money as well as power -more than $40 billion a year in Federal money in the 1980 's. <p> " The bureau is clearly under increasing scrutiny, " said the Census Bureau 's director, Barbara Everitt Bryant. <p> Representative Thomas C. Sawyer, an Ohio Democrat who is the chairman of the House subcommitee that oversees the Census Bureau, said the pressure from this scrutiny might alter the way the census counts people. " We 're undergoing a simultaneous economic, demographic and technological change that is shaping issues more directly than at any time in the past 100 years, " he said. " As a result, the character of the census may not change. But the methodology may change radically. " More Than People Are Being Counted <p> The bureau will continue to count people : the first article of the Constitution requires a count to apportion political power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to include the collection of information about race, income, employment, education, life style, housing, transportation and disability. <p> Warren J. Mitofsky, the executive director of the Voter Research and Surveys Association, a new consortium organized by the major television networks for polling and election data, said that the constituency for highly detailed census data had grown enormously, and that any reduction in the breadth of the count would provoke fierce opposition among those who use the information. <p> " In the political world, it 's the whole foundation of political polling, " Mr. Mitofsky said. <p> Census data is crucial in guiding poll takers and survey researchers who gather information from small samples of people and extrapolate conclusions about much larger population groups. " When you talk about sampling, you 're talking about extending a methodology out from something concrete, " said Charles E. Metcalf, the president of Mathematical Policy Research in Princeton, N.J. To design a sample, he said, " You have to have some basis for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be possible to stand this process on its head, and use sampling techniques to get better data than that gleaned by counting people. Planners in the bureau have already written a paper suggesting that the census in 2000 be a bare-bones effort that would do little more than count people. This could be supplemented by telephone follow-up to contact people who fail to answer and an expansion of existing population surveys to learn how people live and where they come from. <p> Many experts in survey research are concerned about such a change in approach. Vincent Barabba, who was census director twice and is now in charge of market research for the General Motors Corporation, said surveys might indeed provide better information on a national level. But he said he doubts that there is a cost-effective substitute for obtaining reliable local data. <p> Nevertheless, Representative Sawyer believes change of some sort is inevitable. " Each census has been the last census of its type, " he said. " There 's been a rolling evolution. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Congressional committee, says the census works. " But does it work well enough, when the stakes are so high? " Methodology Raises A Basic Question <p> The questions have surfaced before. But this time, some officials say, the bureau is unusually vulnerable to charges that the old way may not be the best way. <p> For one thing, the cost of the bureau 's promised activities to perfect the accuracy of the 1990 census will exceed its current 10-year budget of $2.6 billion, Congressional auditors say. For another, it is far behind its own goals for hiring the temporary workers needed to visit the homes of those who do not fill out the form, with only about half as many hired as the bureau had hoped. <p> Any change in the way the Census Bureau makes it count will tie into the debate over adjusting census figures. Adjustment is a complex mathematical process that would add to the totals for groups underrepresented in the initial count and would thus change the final count. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disputes over census methodology, the bureau 's Commerce Department overseers, who have traditionally remained aloof from statistical details, have said they will decide whether to adjust the figures from the decennial count. Government officials argue that the intervention is needed, given the political ramifications of the decision and the newly pugnacious attitude of the losers. <p> Just five suits were filed against the bureau over the 1970 census. Fifty-two suits were filed over the 1980 census. One of those still simmers : New York City, Houston, Los Angeles, Chicago and Dade County, Fla., want the Census Bureau to adjust the count to compensate for the undercount of as many as 1 million of their poor and minority residents. <p> Some statisticians believe that adjustment, a major philosophical departure from the basic verities of the count, is inevitable. Others fear that it would fundamentally change the agency 's way of doing business and endanger its reputation as one of the least political and most professional agencies in Government. Over Two Centuries, Counts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which in Article I tied each state 's political representation in the House of Representatives to population figures and ordered the Government to get those figures once a decade. <p> At its most basic, the job of the census was heavy arithmetical lifting. At its most creative, the job let scholars create new ways of looking at the world. " The census categories become the language we use to talk about ourselves, " said Margo J. Anderson, a historian at the University of Wisconsin who wrote " The American Census : A Social History. " <p> For instance, it was the census superintendent, Roger A. Porter, who noted in 1891 that settlement was so widespread that " there can hardly be said to be a frontier line. " This comment led the historian Frederick Jackson Turner to declare an end to the era of the American frontier, giving birth to a new school of historical analysis. <p> In 1920, the census told the American people they had crossed the divide that separates a rural nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to record the housing conditions in the country, including how many lavatories were in each household, and whether they were inside or out. In 1980, it showed that the population of the North and Middle West had been outstripped by that of the South and West. <p> Since the mid-19th century, changing social and economic conditions prompted changes in the questionnaire. Now a group of Federal panels rules on requests for new questions. The goal is to keep the long form, which is sent to 17 million households, from being too burdensome or instrusive. <p> In the last two decades, the census has also recorded more and more minority groups who clamored for statistical recognition - and policy benefits. But the groups often felt shortchanged. The minority groups ' desires for recognition in the census mingled with a distrust of motive and method was most recently shown by the leaders of the Gay and Lesbian Task Force, which wants gay couples to identify themselves as unmarried partners, a new category. <p> " Domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's, " said Robert Bray of the task force. " There 's a changing societal definition of what family means. " <p> While the question about unmarried partners was intended to identify heterosexual couples and to distinguish them from roommates or those who live together for economic reasons, homosexual groups decided the question could yield a count of homosexuals living in committed relationships. <p> But " an undercount is inevitable, " said Urvashi Vaid, the executive director of the task force. Couples living together represent only part of the gay population - and many of them may be nervous about identifying themselves out of fear of discrimination. <p> Over all, the people who do not cooperate tend to be poor, nonwhite, and likely to draw Federal funds to a community. But rather than making adjustments, the bureau has tried to overcome the undercount in other ways, like asking the new organizations for extensive coverage and asking clergymen to boost the census in Sunday 's sermons. <p> " It 's upside-down marketing, " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eighty or 90 percent of our effort is targeted at the 10 percent we 're most likely to miss. " Cooperation, a Tool That Wins the War <p> The fear that census data will be misused is one attitude that deters cooperation by people at the fringes of society. Bureau officials know that many people, even those in the mainstream, are concerned that their answers will filter back to the Internal Revenue Service or the Immigration and Naturalization Service. <p> Widespread lack of cooperation, which would effectively kill the census, is the stuff of nightmares for bureau officials. Confidentiality of census records is both a legal requirement and a professional obsession. Access to the main data banks can be accomplished only through bureau telephones. The bureau constantly confers with law-enforcement agencies like the Immigration and Naturalization Service to avoid any coincidences between visits by census takers and raids by the immigration agency. <p> The lack of cooperation that is the bureau 's worst nightmare became a reality in West Germany. There, where the census data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head count was postponed and then canceled after a grass-roots campaign against it. It was finally held, with 85 percent participation, in 1987. <p> In Denmark, no census count is done. The Government gets population data from a national population registry, which everyone must join. But this approach is not popular, said Harvey Choldin, an expert on censuses worldwide who works as a fellow at the Population Reference Bureau in Washington. Of more than 180 countries in the world that do censuses, most do direct counts. <p> Dr. Choldin believes that Americans would never accept an administrative records system. Yet the paradoxical thing is that the American people are extremely cooperative when it comes to the census. In 1980, 83 percent of the forms that went to occupied homes were mailed back. <p> " People see the census as a national historical event in which they are participating, " said Jeffrey Moore, a psychologist with the bureau. " There are n't many of those. " <p> CORRECTION-DATE : April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> CORRECTION : Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about the United States census incorrectly identified in some copies a country in which census data was shared with other Government agencies. That was done in West Germany, not in the United States.
