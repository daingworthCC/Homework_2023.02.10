3042241 <p> The following holiday stories are honorable mentions in our second annual News for Kids holiday story contest. <p> Hi! My name is Brian. I 'm ten years old. I 'm living with my dad now but I used to be an orphan. I 'll tell you my story : <p> My dad put me in the orphanage because when I was five my mom was killed in a car wreck, and if that was n't bad enough, then my dad got fired. My dad could n't take care of me, so that 's how I got into the orphanage. I had been in the orphanage for two years. Ms. Miller took care of me. <p> One day I was reading a book when Ms. Miller -- the mother at the orphanage -- told me that Christmas was in two days! The only thing I really wanted was my dad! I was excited about Christmas, but I was sad also because I did n't have my dad to share it with. <p> Before I could say " Merry Christmas " the holiday was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a surprise. I knew the surprise was coming soon. I had waited long enough and could n't wait anymore. <p> " Please tell me what it is, " I said, " pretty please. " " I ca n't tell you yet, " Ms. Miller said. <p> Just then we heard a knock on the door. " I 'll get it, I 'll get it! " I said. <p> When I answered, there were about 20 young people from a nearby school outside with presents! Christmas presents! <p> " Merry Christmas, " they all shouted. " Come in, " Ms. Miller said, " come on in. " " Thank you! " I said to Ms. Miller. <p> " I think you should thank them. " Ms. Miller said. Then I shouted thank you, thank you. I helped them bring in all the gifts from a car. <p> When I opened my presents I could n't believe my eyes! I got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even an autographed baseball! Even though I did n't get my dad I got other wonderful things. After I opened all the presents, I heard a knock on the door. Ms. Miller answered it. I was so busy playing with my C.D. player I did n't pay attention to the person at the door. But I did hear Ms. Miller say, " Oh, yes, he 's in the Living Room. " <p> Then I looked up and saw my dad standing in the doorway and that was the greatest Christmas gift of all! He had come to take me home. To take me home for good. <p> We spent the rest of the afternoon getting my belongings together and we drove home. When we had gotten home, dad had put up a big Christmas tree. From that day on, I was the happiest kid in the world. <p> So that 's my story. The End. <p> One morning on Christmas, I woke up and Santa was still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at me in despair. He was very embarrassed. He was eating milk and cookies. I laughed and laughed. It was so funny to see Santa in my den. I said to Santa, " You must hurry up and leave before my brother and sisters wake up. " <p> Right as I said that he disappeared. That was odd. I was hoping I would get to see him again. <p> Soon after that my brother and sisters woke up. They asked me, " Were you talking to anyone? " " No, I do n't think so, " I said. <p> Then we all looked out the window and saw Santa Claus driving his sleigh all the way until we could not see him anymore. My brother and sisters all said " Yeah right. " all at the same time, too. <p> We went back to sleep. We woke up and we all went into the den and we all said, " Oh, no! " <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hurry he forgot all about them. So we thought and thought. We could not think of a reason why he did not leave us any presents. <p> Soon I said, " I got it. He wanted us to learn what Christmas really is about. It is about love and not presents. " <p> From then on they never forgot that certain Christmas Day! MELISSA SMITH, Snellville <p> Have you ever wondered what would happen if Rudolph 's nose went out? Well, a few years ago it happened! <p> It was three days before Christmas. Of course, the other reindeer were making fun of Rudolph and his nose, so Rudolph went for a walk. Just to get away from the jokes. Rudolph walked and walked. He was crying so he was n't paying attention to where he was going. <p> It began to rain and Rudolph realized he was lost. He turned around and ran. It took him four hours to get home. When he did get home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneeze and cough. Rudolph had been in the rain so long he caught a cold. <p> He just sneezed and sneezed. Finally Rudolph sneezed so hard his glowing red nose just ran out of glow! Rudolph panicked. How would he get his cold gone and his glow back before Christmas? How would he guide the sleigh? <p> He ran to Santa 's workshop right way to tell Santa. Santa could not believe it. He just sat there staring at Rudolph 's unlit nose. <p> Santa got up very slowly and walked over to Rudolph. Santa said, " If you want, you can still come along. " <p> Rudolph replied, " Yes, I would still like to come along. " Santa said, " Very well, then. " <p> It was the big night, Christmas. Santa harnessed up the reindeer. Rudolph was still in front as if his nose were still as bright as a lightbulb. Santa finished preparing the sleigh. He went inside for some hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sniffles. Santa came out with his steaming hot chocolate. Santa called out the names and off they went. <p> They were going against the wind so Santa 's hot chocolate steam was blowing on Rudolph. The cinnamon in his hot chocolate made Rudolph 's nose tickle. Then all of a sudden, Rudolph sneezed and his nose lit up like a Christmas tree. <p> Santa was so happy, and now every year Rudolph has a cup of hot chocolate with cinnamon hand just in case. <p> LINDSEY HOWARD, Lithonia <p> About fifty years ago a skinny Santa and his elves were working very hard on Christmas Eve. Stuff like loading the sleigh. Santa made his rounds giving toys to all the kids when he was done he had one bag left he looked in it. <p> Meanwhile at home, the elves were happy so they decided to make cookies for Santa. They turned on the machine, it was going good. <p> After Santa had looked in he was so confused. Candy canes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home the cookie machine was going wacko. Cookies were just pouring out of it. <p> Santa in his sleigh found another bag of candy canes he decided to eat them too. He did and he got fatter than he was before. He kept on eating and eating. He got fatter and fatter. <p> At home the elves wrapped the cookies for him at home and waited. They called Santa on his walkie-talkie, but Santa was still eating candy canes. He was up to 350 pounds. <p> The elves said that he needed to come home right now so he came. Santa was so fat that his reindeer could n't pull his sleigh so he put dust on them of he went. <p> The elves got ready. They had about three million cookies for him. Santa came in. The elves did n't recognize him, but they heard his Ho! Ho! Ho! The elves gave the cookies to him ; he ate all three million. He was so happy he jumped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> BECKY MARIE SEYMOUR, Lilburn <p> One day on Dec. 20, there were two 10-year-old boys who were joyfully teasing six 5-year-olds because they believed that Santa Claus was real. <p> " There is too a Santa Claus! " shouted one of the frustrated 5-year- olds. " Then, I 'd like to see you catch him! " " If you say he 's not real, then how do we catch him? " asked a 5-year-old. " Fine then, we 'll set up a trap. If it catches him, we lose and we give you a dollar. But, if we do n't catch him, you 'll give us a dollar. That means a dollar for each of us, " replied one of the 10-year-olds. The 5-year-olds agreed and the two groups walked away. That 's how it all started. <p> Well, the story continued that afternoon. <p> " Now all we need to do is sit around tell those little babies that we 're making a trap, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too mean, " said the other. <p> So, they set up a very lame trap in about an hour. They set out a chair with some milk and chocolate chip cookies for the bait. Then they put mouse traps all over the chair. The two boys spent the night at one of their houses. They stayed awake in a room until they heard a voice. The two boys ran down the stairs as fast as possible. <p> " Arrrrgh! Dang it! " said a man who looked like he was suffering a lot of pain. " Boy! I did n't know that Santa Claus was real! Much less did I know that he looked like my dad! " said one of the boys. <p> " I am your dad! " said the now angry and hurt man. " Oops. Sorry, dad. We had made a bet with a couple of 5-year-olds... " The two boys explained and the dad drove the visitor back to his house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they thought that saw a figure in the sky. <p> They each grabbed their binoculars and looked through them. They saw or at least they thought they saw a sleigh attached to some reindeer. When they looked at the sleigh they saw Santa Claus on the sleigh with one of his legs in a cast. Then, they heard him say, " I hate mouse traps! " <p> LEILA HAIDARI, Lawrenceville <p> On a cold winter night there was a freezing, cold little boy about 6 years old and he had no food. Just then a 20-year-old named Amy walked by, who had just been coming back from the Super Market with a bag of food. The nice lady that she is, she gave the boy enough food to last 10 days, but only enough for two meals a day. The boy did n't seem to care, he was just happy to have food. <p> The next day when Amy was going to where the boy was, so she could give him some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just left all of the blankets there hoping he would return her favors for her one day and he would be extremely happy to be warm now. <p> Days went by and it was time to give the boy his food and he was not there, so she left the food for him. The next day she went back. He was not there, but what was there was chicken bones and apple cores. Amy got very worried when day after day went by and he was not there, but the leftover food was. <p> One night, the night of December 30, 1986, when Amy went to drop off the food she hid behind the trash can and waited. About 35 minutes later, about midnight, she saw things flying in the air. Amy though that they were shooting stars, but when one went right down to the food she saw that they were n't shooting stars after all. They were reindeer. The deer that went down somehow managed to turn into a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old and was the exact same boy that she was feeding. Amy watched in amazement. All of a sudden Amy jumped out from behind the trash can. <p> Amy said, " Now I know why you were n't there, all of those days, you were at the North Pole. " <p> The boy said, " I guess you caught me. I tried to keep it a secret, but you must have been curious. Now you know and I must fade away just because somebody sees you. " <p> " What if I kept the secret, would you stay at my house and not fade away. " <p> " Yes, " says the boy and they lived happily ever after. AMY KUBIS, Suwanee <p> Eleven year old Clara gazed out the orphanage window. The snow piled up high like mashed potatoes on the hills, and the red berries were as bright as roses. Oh, how Clara wished she could be a part of it. <p> Clara Basil was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of her relatives lived near by, so she was sent to Northside Orphanage in Virginia. <p> As Clara looked at the berries, she had to have some. So she jumped into her robe and boots and ran out the door. When she came back, her arms full of berries, the director Ms. Dag was talking to some of the workers. <p> " Clara Basil is the most strangest person I know. She always seems to be in a world of her own. Her grandfather does n't even have time to come all this way to get her. I would n't be surprised if her does n't care about her at all. " <p> At that Clara, dropped her berries in shock. Ms. Dag turned around, but before she could say anything, Clara grabbed her berries and ran to her room. " Oh grandfather, I know you care about me. Please come get me. I hate it here! " cried Clara. <p> Clara removed a medium sized box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had of her own. She put the berries in the box. Just as she slid the box under her bed, Katherine, her best friend came in and told her it was time for breakfast. <p> Clara sauntered down the stairs to the table. She had a light breakfast of milk and toast, without butter or jam. After breakfast, Ms. Dag told everyone that they could have ten minutes outside. Disappointed by the time limit, Clara walked outside with the other kids. <p> The next day was Christmas Eve. Everyone was too busy with their stockings and decorations to enjoy the snow. Everyone except Clara. She was excited about Christmas and all, but not the way she used to be. She also knew that her mother and father would never again see her eyes light up as she looked in her stocking, never again. Clara 's eyes filled up with tears as she thought about her parents. It was going to be the worst Christmas ever. <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see what Santa had left in her stocking. She got a apple, a candy cane and a small bracelet. She missed real presents. <p> Just then, there was a loud knock at the door. In stepped a grey haired man with a loving face. Immediately Clara knew who it was. <p> " Grandpa! " Clara shouted as she ran toward him. He scooped her up in his arms. He handed her a box. Inside the box was a locket. There were two pictures in it. One was her mother and the other was her father. " Oh thank you grandpa! " Clara cried as she hugged him. <p> Clara knew she would be happy living with her grandfather and not in the orphanage, and that was the best present that anyone could give her! <p> EMMY MADDIX, Lilburn <p> It was just one ordinary day, when one elf spotted Santa leaving. The elf says, " Where are you going? " <p> " Why, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Remember we make toys here. These toys are too big, fat and complicated to make, " said Santa. <p> " Well, OK, " said the elf. <p> Santa went to his secret place where he had some of his toys already. He hopped in his biggest one, the plane and flew off. He finally got there. The place is called Toys'R'Us. The first place he went to is where they have the biggest toys. He took out his bag. He put a remote control monster truck, a train set, with 250 pieces, an army tank that a kid could get in( not 7 years old or up), a dump truck a kid can play with, and trampoline. Then he told the clerk he did n't want anything today. Then he got back into his plane and flew back to the North Pole. When he arrived at the North Pole he got out of his plane and started walking into the shop. An elf came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bee <p> Santa said, " Oh, nowhere. " The elf said, " What is in the bag? " He said, " Oh, nothing. " <p> He started to walk away when he dropped the bag and the toys fell out, the other elf said, " So that 's what you did. You stole toys. " <p> Then the elves took him to the nearest police( they took him to jail). Then they found a new man for the job. His name is Tim Allen( on " Home Improvement " in real life). <p> BRADLEY SPEERS, Lithonia <p> Once there was a boy. A boy with big dreams. The only problem was that he was an orphan at an orphanage. All he wanted for Christmas was a loving, caring family. He was ten and his name was Michael. He was a very talented boy. He was only five when it all happened. But he still took it pretty hard. Santa watched out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a miracle happen for Michael. <p> Then there was the Johnson family. They had a big house and a dog and a lot of love to give. They were the perfect family for Michael. Santa wrote a secret letter to the Johnson family sending Michael 's date of birth, a picture and what Michael liked the Johnson family were going to make this little boy 's dreams come true! The day before Christmas the Johnsons went out and bought presents for Michael. Then they went 911 picked Michael up from the Orphanage. He had tears in his eyes. He was both happy and sad. Happy because he was finally getting a family but, sad because he did not think he deserved it. <p> That day he went to his new home. The Johnsons had a bed ready for him. The next day he woke up and started crying because he had nothing to give to them. He told them all about it and they said it was OK. That day was the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch of toys, but best of all, he finally got a family. <p> CHRIS NORRIS, Snellville
