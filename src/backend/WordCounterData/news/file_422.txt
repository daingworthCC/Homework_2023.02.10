3071241 <p> In sharp contrast to Silicon Valley 's gleaming labs and sleek cubicles lies a hidden, low-tech underbelly : a loose network of Asian immigrants who are paid by the piece to assemble electronic parts in their homes for some of high tech 's major companies, in apparent violation of labor, tax and safety laws. <p> Whole families, particularly in the Vietnamese emigre community, can be found working far into the night. At kitchen tables and garage workbenches, they solder tiny wires, strip cables and load hundreds of different colored transistors onto printed circuit boards, painstakingly assembling the nervous systems of high-tech products, for as little as a penny per component. <p> " It does n't work out to a lot of money, only about $ 4 to $ 5 an hour for both of us together, sometimes even less, " said Thu Duong, a soft-spoken 40-year-old Vietnamese immigrant who until January assembled cables with her sister in their small apartment in downtown San Jose, Calif. Like many other workers, she speaks only reluctantly about the work, which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Components Inc. of Fremont, Calif. <p> At least a dozen electronics contract manufacturers - ranging from small firms like Compass to multibillion-dollar giants such as Solectron Corp. of Milpitas, Calif. - have been involved in piecework arrangements in the past year, a San Jose Mercury News investigation shows. Contract manufacturers build parts and systems for companies such as Hewlett-Packard Co., Sun Microsystems Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc. <p> Paying by the piece has been central to the growth of contract manufacturing, letting companies cut the time it takes to make a product without adding much to the final cost. Although the practice never involved huge volumes of work and has dwindled in recent years at large companies, it has always been critical for completing rush jobs. And workers say it remains robust at many smaller companies, especially cable assembly houses. <p> " What( the news report is) describing are serious, serious violations of the law, " said Miles Locker, chief counsel for California 's Division of Labor Standards Enforcement. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's time in jail. " <p> A short-lived investigation by state labor officials into high-tech home assembly in 1980 did not result in any fines or charges, according to Deputy Labor Commissioner Joe Razo, who handled the investigation. Neither Razo, Locker nor John Glyder, district director for the U.S. Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division in San Francisco, recalls any more recent investigations into the practice. <p> The companies that pay for piecework generally regard such workers as independent contractors, for whom they would have limited responsibility. None told the Mercury News that it oversees the conditions in which workers sometimes use hazardous materials at home or let children lend a hand. <p> Experts say contract manufacturers in Silicon Valley total roughly 300, although there are no official tallies. <p> Of the 14 local companies that the Mercury News confirmed are involved in piecework arrangements, 12 acknowledged the activity, one denied it and one called such work " unacceptable. " <p> Some, like Compass, say sending work home with staff is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality unless it 's built on our floor, " said Compass President Doug Lanagan. <p> Others see nothing wrong with it. Said Craig Jorgenson, director of operations for Pulnix America Inc., a Sunnyvale, Calif., firm that makes cameras for industrial automation and sends work home with employees : " It works for us, and it works for them. " <p> Officials at Solectron, the pacesetter of contract manufacturing, say that, in the early 1980s, employees helped out by taking work home but that it 's now against company policy. Nevertheless, an inquiry from the Mercury News triggered an internal audit in which Solectron discovered one of its subcontractors paying workers by the piece. The company said it has suspended business with the subcontractor. <p> Paying by the piece for work in and of itself is n't illegal, but the piece rate is subject to minimum wage and overtime laws. The law does not allow companies to pay an hourly rate to an employee and then pay the same employee by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hire contract manufacturers express shock at the possibility that some of their components might be assembled in a kitchen. <p> " It 's totally prohibited, " said David Fearnhead, a manager at HP, one of Solectron 's biggest customers. " It would clearly disqualify the factory and the company. " <p> Others have little to say about it. <p> " We have contractual agreements with our vendors that they follow all applicable laws, and we expect them to do that, " said Dave Berman, an IBM spokesman. Sun declined to comment. <p> And some, such as networking giant Cisco and chip maker Atmel Corp., themselves pay independent contractors by the piece to assemble cables and prototype boards. One worker, who assembles connectors and boards at home, showed the Mercury News her Cisco work order and said the parts were for the company 's internal use. <p> Cisco said, " All product assembly work must take place in Cisco-certified facilities, even R &D; product work for Cisco internal use. If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unacceptable practice of home assembly, Cisco would take immediate and corrective action. " <p> Atmel said it pays home assemblers to build boards for its own use. <p> Ignorant of longstanding protections offered by U.S. laws and often barely able to speak English, immigrants are grateful for the work. It supplements income from low-wage day jobs that are the mainstay of their extended families. A quick worker can make $ 20 an hour or more, but the basic rule is the same as in piecework sweatshops around the globe : The faster you work, the more you make. <p> For piecework, many workers barely earn the equivalent of the $ 5.75-per-hour state minimum wage, and none receives overtime pay. Few realize they should. <p> High-tech home assembly can be found as far afield as Southern California, New Jersey or Germany, according to people who have witnessed such work or done it themselves. But in Silicon Valley it is impossible to say how many people are involved because workers are scattered, working independently in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or industry group keeps tabs on what is essentially an underground practice. <p> Two decades ago, it was largely a cash-based, under-the-table kind of activity. <p> Now, at-home industrial piecework has taken on a more legitimate patina. But the work still takes place mostly within a close-knit, word-of-mouth community that crisscrosses the low-tech end of high tech. An assembly worker takes a job home, invites a relative to help, who brings along a friend and so forth. <p> " I call them Vietnamese mother-in-laws, people who ca n't get into the general workforce, " said Bill De Carbonel, vice president at Adaptive Electronics Inc. of San Jose, which said it uses home assemblers to build boards that will not be damaged by nonfactory conditions. <p> Each of the 70-plus people interviewed who had done such work or knew about the practice said they knew many others who have been involved. They mentioned at least another 16 companies who paid for piecework at home aside from those the Mercury News focused on. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Gerhard Mueller, vice president at A-Plus Manufacturing Corp., a leading assembly house in San Jose that he said does not send work home. " But few will talk about it. I guarantee you it goes on all over. " <p> The arrangements for piecework are myriad, sometimes involving just the assembly house and its own staff employees. Other times, a middleman takes the job and parcels it out to a crew of workers. <p> The valley 's several hundred assembly houses, the largest concentration in the United States, occupy a critical niche in Silicon Valley 's high-tech industry. <p> The rationale for the contract manufacturing industry is to keep up speed and hold down costs. Customers of contract manufacturers can save from 15 percent to 50 percent by outsourcing manufacturing, said Keith Dunne, managing director of BancBoston Robertson Stephens. The assembly companies are no-frills operations, run with an unforgiving eye on the bottom line. MAKING IT <p> Contract manufacturing is n't sexy, but assembly houses lie at the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DO - Contract manufacturers are experts at assembling the guts of familiar products such as personal computers or cell phones, which are designed and ultimately marketed by such big names as Hewlett-Packard Co., Apple Computer Inc. or IBM. They help perfect the design of new products by making prototype and preproduction printed circuit boards and manufacture full runs of sophisticated boards. <p> WHO THEY ARE - The worldwide industry includes seven multibillion-dollar operations, such as Solectron Corp. of Milpitas, Calif., about a dozen companies with revenues of $ 100 million and hundreds of smaller shops, according to William E. Cage Jr., partner at J.C. Bradford &; Co., a Nashville, Tenn., investment banking firm that has tracked the industry for the last decade. <p> In Silicon Valley, home to the greatest concentration of electronics manufacturers in the nation, five contract manufacturers made the Mercury News ' 1998 list of Silicon Valley 's 150 largest companies. Electronic manufacturing services is the list 's fastest-growing profitable sector. <p> HOW MUCH THEY ARE WORTH - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an estimated $ 90 billion worldwide by 1998 and is projected to hit about $ 178 billion worldwide by the year 2001, according to Technology Forecasters Inc. Today, it represents barely 20 percent of the $ 500 billion electronics equipment market, says Keith Dunne, managing director of BancBoston Robertson Stephens. But analysts expect contract manufacturing to account for as much as 65 percent of the market in the next five to 10 years. <p> WHY THEY DO IT - While mass production has largely moved offshore, a lot of manufacturing - especially of cutting-edge products - still takes place in Silicon Valley. The reason : Local contract manufacturers can do the work faster and more conveniently, helping companies shave the time it takes to bring new products to market. <p> LATEST INDUSTRY NEWS - Leading contract manufacturers are increasingly trying to expand their turf beyond simple assembly into other parts of product creation. Original-equipment manufacturers have turned to them to produce complete products, not just boards or other components, and to provide help with design, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are snapping up smaller ones and OEMs are selling manufacturing plants to contract manufacturers for close to book value. Contract manufacturers have completed roughly 82 mergers and acquisitions in the last four years, and OEMs have completed 54 divestitures of plants in the same period, according to J.C. Bradford. <p> - Knight Ridder Tribune @p#
