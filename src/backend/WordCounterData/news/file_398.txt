3067541 <p> British director Terence Davies only makes films every few years. " Distant Voices, Still Lives, " his first movie distributed widely in the United States, came out in 1988. " The Long Day Closes, " which opens in Denver on Friday, premiered at Cannes in 1992. Davies( pronounced Davis) works slowly and carefully. His exquisitely crafted films devel- op over time as images build upon images. <p> The autobiographical " The Long Day Closes " is about Davies ' life between the ages of 7 and 11. Called Bud, the boy is shown at school, at church, with his family, watching his older brothers and sisters and sitting on an inside stairway listening to his own thoughts. <p> Davies has a unique sensibility in the commercial cinema. He makes allusive films that work off suggestion and nuance. Both " Distant Voices, Still Lives " and " The Long Day Closes " are autobiographical pieces that slide from one scene to another as smoothly as human memory connects disparate moments in a person 's life. Remembered moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trigger other memories. <p> Film, which can be made to imitate the visual and aural dimensions of memory, lends itself beautifully to Davies ' style of storytelling. Davies does n't so much depict the lives of his characters as he takes you into their subjectivity and has you glide along with the rhythms and the images of their thoughts. <p> " You begin by what you remember the most vividly, " he said of the way he constructs his movies. " You do n't remember in chronological time ; you remember in emotional time, so that things which in themselves are not important are expanded to great lengths, and others that are of great importance come down to a few seconds of screen time or are not there at all. <p> Re-creating the past <p> " You 're trying to remember what it was like, and to re-create that. But you have technique where you say, ' How can I best say that? How can I best impart( what is) information, but appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( while) writing a sequence at the end( of " The Long Day Closes "), ' How do I show the parameters of this child 's life? How do you do it? ' I do n't know where it came from, but I can remember one of my sisters-in-law taking me to see - at the Palladium Cinema in West Darby Road in Liverpool - ' Tammy. ' And as soon as I remembered ' Tammy, ' I knew what the sequence should be - those overhead shots. <p> " What are the parameters of his( Bud 's) life? - school, the church, the cinema, the street, home. And that 's the way to do it - overhead shots mixed by dissolves, with extracts from other films of the time. " <p> Remembering side-by-side <p> " The Long Day Closes " is a remarkable tapestry of scenes from Davies ' life : songs of the time, bits of films and long shots of Bud looking out the window of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this may sound tedious, but on screen these shots of the rain allow the other moments to settle into your mind and grow. You make your own associations and find yourself remembering side-by-side with young Bud. <p> I spoke with Davies at the Telluride Film Festival in 1992.( It 's shameful that the film, released in 1988, took so long to get to Denver.) He 's a slightly built man, now 50 years old, and with gray hair, but he " plays " much younger than that. He 's so excited to talk about his work that you wonder if he 'll just jump out of his skin, a quality that makes him seem both physical and ethereal at the same time. <p> Davies also seems so open about himself it 's hard to imagine he has any secrets at all. In one sentence he throws his excitement into the air for all the world to see, and in the next his depth of disappointment and, unfortunately, his self-loathing get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openly about his life, the unhappiness of his early years and the misery inflicted on him by other boys who knew - instinctively, Davies says - that he was a sissy, that he was gay. In words that brought the two of us near tears, Davies described how a group of three boys beat him after school every day for several years. <p> " They robbed me forever of my feeling of self-worth, " he said. In a flash of delightful petty vengeance, he added that he hoped to come back in a next life as an athlete, big, strapping - and dumb. Davis says " The Long Day Closes " is about the only genuinely happy period of his life. <p> " My first seven years, when my father was alive, were pretty awful, which is why all the pain of his malign influence was in ' Distant Voices, Still Lives. ' After he died in 1952, when I was 7, I was taken to the movies for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rain, ' which was my first film. And I fell in love with the American musical then. " <p> Sick with happiness <p> " From 7 to 11, while I was in primary school - which was a mixed school( boys and girls), one which was very gentle and where I was very happy - those four years, when I went to the movies all the time, and was happy at school and was loved at home, were four of the happiest years of my life. I was ecstatic with happiness ; I was sick with it. " <p> Translating Davies ' conversation into print is a great frustration. He speaks with a voice made for radio, a voice that rises with dramatic intensity, rushes with excitement and drops down into whispered intimacies. Like " The Long Day Closes, " Davies ' talk is all of a piece. He barely stops to end sentences before his voice picks up again and dances from clause to clause, idea to idea, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees film as music, a purely subjective art in which the story told on screen is but half the experience, matched by the story it evokes in a viewer. For that reason, he said, the film clips in " The Long Day Closes, " wonderful bits from " The Lady- <p> killers, " " The Magnificent Ambersons, " " Carousel " and other pictures, are only in sound. You hear them but the images on screen are the thoughts they inspire in Davies ' young Bud. <p> " You can create so much more by what you hear, because if you hear something that 's familiar, you supply the image. That 's why radio was so powerful. You supply the images. You do! I suppose the greatest radio play was, of course, by Dylan Thomas, ' Under Milkwood. ' The language is wonderful - but you supply the images. " <p> To some film students at Telluride, Davies described the heart of his idea of filmmaking, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not mean anything. One chord does not mean anything. It 's only when you juxtapose other chords and other notes, and use things like counterpoint and chiasmus and all that, that the music takes on a meaning. But it 's a completely subjective meaning. What I get from Shostakovich, you wo n't get. You get something else. <p> " Cinema 's the same. One image does n't mean anything. it 's only when you juxtapose it with something else that it takes on a kind of meaning, a kind of narrative. At the simplest level, one closeup cut to another - a man, a woman. He says ' Yes, ' she says ' No. ' What does it mean? <p> Subliminal questions <p> " Actually, you do n't ask that. You ask all sorts of other things and you ask them subliminally - ' Who are they? Where are they? What is their relationship? Are they brother and sister? Are they man and wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another? ' <p> " All that has happened like that( he clapped his hands), and it 's happened subliminally. So if you can do that with a simple closeup or juxtaposition of notes, think what you can do with many juxtapositions of images. " <p> Bad years celebrated <p> The unhappiness of Davies ' life is right on the surface. He talks about it, uses it for his art and works it through. However bad those years were with his abusive father and later the vicious boys at school, he treats the four years described in " The Long Day Closes " majestically. He holds onto them, takes strength from them and celebrates them simultaneously with the bad times. <p> " What I had, which was incomparable - I had my family, whom I loved and who adored me. And I had the movies. Those two. I just thought, ' This will last forever. This paradise! ' So that when it rained, you did n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic. <p> " It was like ' Singin ' in the Rain. ' When it snowed, it was like ' White Christmas. ' You could see it! I mean, you could see it! "
