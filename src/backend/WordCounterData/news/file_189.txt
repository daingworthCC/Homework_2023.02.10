3037841 <p> On a kitchen clipboard next to copper pasta pots hangs a two-page handwritten letter. The writer tells of a relative jailed as a political prisoner in Argentina between 1976 and 1983 -- a time known as " the dirty war, " when abductions and killings by the secret police were common. The letter ends with " gracias. " <p> This is a home into which such letters come routinely. File cabinets brim with thanks on behalf of lost, tortured and silenced people. It is the home of Ginetta. <p> Known universally by only her first name, the Italian-born Ginetta Sagan, 70, helped establish Amnesty International as a major human rights group in the United States nearly 30 years ago and is now its honorary chairwoman. She is of the rare breed who devote themselves to an issue and stay with it. They persist in dry times when all seems futile and exult in heady moments when, after a few decades of toil, awards and honors are given. <p> Among her recent honors : the Grand Ufficiale award, given by the Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders ago, tortured and nearly killed her. The citation reads : " Ginetta Sagan has dedicated her entire life with incomparable dedication and intelligence to liberate political prisoners, regardless of ideology or political alignment, throughout the world. Her humanitarian work, recognized and appreciated at the highest international levels, has and will continue to give distinction to Italy, her native land to which she holds great attachment. " <p> Ginetta 's involvement with Amnesty International dates to the mid-1960s, when the London-based organization was only a few years old. Its work included educating the public about governments that torture prisoners of conscience, or that subject them to sham trials. Abuses were documented in annual country-by-country reports, a literature of depravity. <p> Today Amnesty is a Nobel Peace Prize winner, with more than 1 million members, donors and subscribers in more than 150 countries. Some 4,300 local groups meet regularly. In addition to standing against torture, Amnesty has consistently opposed the death penalty, whether in the United States or under such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Not long ago, Amnesty began a new initiative, the Ginetta Sagan Fund. The goal is to build a $ 2 million endowment -- $ 150,000 has already come in -- to help women and children jailed or tortured as political prisoners. " In a world racked by violence, " the 1995 Amnesty report states, " women face rape, mutilation and death at the hands of armed men. Yet all too often these women remain invisible. Their tales are not heard. Their plight is hidden by the sheer scale of the tragedies. " <p> Ginetta has something more than a theoretical knowledge of such things. <p> The Little Mouse <p> In 1942 in Milan, Ginetta joined the Italian resistance, delivering papers among underground groups and to the clandestine press. She was daring -- one venture involved dressing as a cleaning lady to enter government offices to snatch letterhead on which documents of safe passage to Switzerland could be written. She was a schoolgirl of 17, the daughter of a Jewish mother and Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew the risks of opposing the Mussolini regime. <p> They knew also that their daughter -- nicknamed " Topolino "( " Little Mouse ") by her underground friends -- was taking chances with her life. So why should n't they take risks, too? Her parents refused chances to escape through the Alps. In 1943 they were taken from their Milan home, one to be shot, the other to die in Auschwitz. <p> Ginetta continued her dangerous work, and in February 1945 she was captured by Mussolini 's Black Brigade. Torture -- including rape and beatings -- followed. In her autobiography, now nearing completion, she recalls : " My greatest fear, greater even than the fear of death which seemed almost a certainty, was that I would betray my comrades to the Black Brigade. But to all the torturer 's questions I had managed to answer, ' I do n't know, I do n't know. ' Somehow, I had gotten my mind into the groove of ' I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the Black Brigade ' nurse ' injected me with sodium pentothal. " <p> Two months later and near death, Ginetta was miraculously rescued by two Germans -- former Nazis -- disguised as Gestapo agents. They took her to a Catholic hospital and turned her over to the Mother Superior and freedom. <p> One recent Sunday evening -- with her husband, Leonard, a physician, beside her -- Ginetta spoke of those distant days of bravery. And she spoke of more recent turns from oppression to freedom, in South Africa, parts of Latin America and Eastern Europe. She has a melodious voice, slightly accented and surprisingly deep for a woman not five feet tall. Her hands reach out to touch your arm when she comes to the point of a story. <p> She has many stories, including her favorites of dictators pressured to free political prisoners and of joyous meetings with men and women she has helped to save. " When the military regime fell in 1974, " she says, telling a story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a group of Amnesty people who had a conference in Athens on the medical effects of torture. For me, it meant going back to meet all these wonderful people -- former prisoners, their families, friends. There was one particular person who said, ' Ginetta, we have never forgotten the day when you said, " One day there will be freedom in Athens. " ' <p> " That was very emotional for me. " <p> A Helping Hand <p> Not surprisingly, Ginetta 's allies include folk singer and activist Joan Baez. Their friendship goes back to 1972, when, uninvited and unannounced, Ginetta showed up at the front door of Baez 's home a few miles from here. <p> " I had all these cases of political prisoners coming in, " Ginetta remembers, " and very few people to help at that time, to develop the organization. I thought, who is going to help? Nobody is going to listen to me. <p> " I thought I would bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ask her, would she please help. I think she was a little overwhelmed. I had lots of cases. She looked at them. We sat outside and talked. She said, ' Yes, I will help you. ' " <p> Baez began promoting Amnesty 's mission in her concerts, and gave Amnesty a year of full-time work. Inspired by Ginetta, Baez became a willing menial in the Sagan home, addressing envelopes, taking phone calls, running errands and caring for the overflowing files of documents, case sheets and Amnesty literature. <p> " Sometimes people would call me and say that my secretary has such a beautiful voice, " Ginetta says with a smile. <p> In her memoir, " And a Voice to Sing With, " Baez recalls those times : " Ginetta was a fireball of energy and compassion and a European intellectual, eager to share her knowledge and experiences with me. She had three sons ; perhaps she would have liked a daughter. " <p> In 1975 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning, she rose before dawn to go to a friend 's house in the neighborhood where a relatively obscure Georgia politician was staying. He was trying to persuade Californians that he should be the next president. At 6 a.m., Ginetta met with Jimmy Carter. <p> " I spent half an hour in the living room telling him about the work of Amnesty.... After our meeting, he spoke to about 300 people who were in the garden to hear him talk about his views. He said that if he became president he would make human rights a major part of his foreign policy, " she says. <p> But not everyone was an ally. <p> In the years after the war in Southeast Asia, she spoke out against human rights violations by the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. In 1979, Ginetta and her husband joined a group of Americans who signed an open letter to the Vietnamese government calling for it " to end the imprisonment and torture " of thousands of political prisoners. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war and who believed that North Vietnam had been wronged by U.S. military intervention, objected -- loudly and indignantly. Jane Fonda refused to sign the letter, which had been drafted by Baez. William Kunstler called the criticism of Vietnam a " cruel and wanton act, " adding : " I do not believe in public attacks on socialist countries, even where violations of human rights may occur. " <p> Ginetta was not deterred. During the 1980s, she gathered information from more than 800 former Vietnamese prisoners. She published a 150-page report on Vietnam 's human rights violations. The most recent Amnesty report states that " at least 60 prisoners of conscience and possible prisoners of conscience remained imprisoned in 1994. " <p> " As in the past, it is not the evidence of injustice that is lacking, " Ginetta says, " it is the courage to believe in and act upon this evidence to help these victims that is missing. We can truly help. Silence in the face of injustice is complicity with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel is on display now. Ginetta has colorectal cancer. She has had surgery and chemotherapy but is no longer taking treatment of any kind. Instead she is using what time remains to carry on her volunteer work for Amnesty. She cites the grim statistics relentlessly : 80 percent of the world 's 20 million refugees are women and children. And 80 percent of war casualties in the 1990s have been civilian. <p> " We must -- we must -- abolish violence and torture as a means of resolving conflict, " she says. <p> Finding Her Muse <p> For Ginetta, it was n't always certain that human rights would be her mission. At war 's end in 1945, Ginetta entered an Italian convalescent home to recover her physical and mental health. Her godfather -- a friend of her late father 's who was living in Paris -- found her and suggested that she come to study at the Sorbonne. There she met Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre, and her professors urged her to study in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1951. On her first day, in a cafeteria line, she said hello to another new student. He was Leonard Sagan, a San Franciscan and Stanford graduate beginning his first year of medical school. Six months later, they married. <p> Together now 44 years, they have three sons and, in 1994, published a jointly written Italian cookbook. In the introduction, which is spiced with recollections and anecdotes, Leonard Sagan tells of his wife 's wartime captivity : " Her spirits were devastated. Did any of her comrades know where she was? Would she ever see them again? <p> " The door to her dark room was flung open one night, and a bread roll thrown in. It was the same kind of large roll you see all over Italy today, baked with a sort of cavity in the center of it. When Ginetta tore open the roll to eat it, she discovered a matchbox.... She slid apart the matchbox, and inside was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coraggio, the Italian word for courage.... She was not alone. Ginetta 's despair was lifted in that moment, and she had the strength and the courage to go on. "
