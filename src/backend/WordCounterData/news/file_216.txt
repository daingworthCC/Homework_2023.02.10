3041541 <p> At the Japanese Peace Memorial perched high on a crest of one of this island 's characteristic ridges, our local guide, attempting to place his nation within the framework of World War II history, remarked that the area 's battles lasted " just six months. " <p> " Just? " gasped Army veteran Bernard Silber, 83. " Just? " <p> Moments later, when the hapless guide pointed to what he said was the famous " Bloody Ridge, " Silber and Navy veteran Richard Landis, 73, corrected him without hesitation. Gesturing toward another ridge that, while nearly indistinguishable from the first, was a few hundred yards closer to Henderson Air Field, they lined up their outstretched arms like brandished swords. <p> Behind them, three scandalized ex-war wives tittered in exasperation, then walked away. <p> The men knew. They 'd seen that ridge when the blood was fresh. <p> The Japanese occupied Guadalcanal in 1942, intending to build an airfield to cover their southward sweep. In the decisive battles that followed, more than 30,000 lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a forward base for the Allied leapfrog campaign toward Japan was established. <p> Guadalcanal is still a mesmerizing hell. Even in the cool season - we were there in late May, autumn in the Southern Hemisphere - it is sauna-hot and humid, with scant breeze and shade. Honiara - the postwar capital by default, after the British imperial outpost at Tulagi was destroyed - sprung up on the leavings of the American war machine. Quonset huts became hotels ; air fields, flat golf courses. Today, the town is dusty and fly-ridden, a place to get through. <p> It 's also a regular stop for veterans ' groups and battle ground tours. Increasingly the scene of reunions as the 50th anniversaries of famous battles occurred, the area formerly called the Pacific " theater " offers much to students of World War II and island culture. But anyone in search of unspoiled, unfamiliar territory will find plenty to admire. <p> Easy excursions from Honiara include volcanic Savo Island( birds hatch their eggs on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nggela( Florida) Islands. <p> Unlike package tours to the Normandy beaches, trips to even the best- known Pacific battle sites are unpredictable and definitely hard-class. During an afternoon 's minivan campaign around Honiara, we visited a fenced monument to the American war dead( the gate was locked) ; a missionary school baited with an intact Zero fighter plane( the yard was locked, though we did manage to rouse a teacher with a key) ; Henderson Field, the principal objective of all the fighting, now the international airport( the restrooms were out of order) ; and Bloody Ridge itself, a lush, harsh wasteland above coconut and banana plantations, where we were instantly surrounded by thin children who looked as if they could use a few C-rations. <p> Ten days earlier, we 'd boarded the 285-foot World Discoverer, an elderly but cozy expedition ship, sailing round trip from Fiji.( That 's about 17 hours flying time from Atlanta. With intermediate stops, figure on a full day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @.) <p> Besides Landis and Silber, both from California, the passenger list included a woman whose first husband disappeared on a wartime flight out of Henderson Field ; about two dozen Germans and Austrians ; a retired member of the French diplomatic corps ; and other American veterans such as Lou Connick, the survivor of a Marine landing on Iwo Jima( " My wife has quit going on these. She said she ca n't figure what keeps drawing me back "). <p> Chartered by Society Expeditions of Seattle ; owned by a holding company in Bremen, Germany ; registered in Liberia ; and with officers, staff and crew drawn from a dozen nations, the " Disco, " like many other cruise ships, is a cultural buffet. The 18-day cruise itself offered bits of everything except casino, floor shows and gourmet cuisine. <p> Designed as an outing for members of the Smithsonian Institution, the cruise combined visits to invasion beaches and monuments with a regular adventure itinerary of scuba dives, snorkeling, wildlife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip to a volcano. <p> Tough choices sometimes had to be made. At Kennedy Island, a sand bank with trees( but no fresh water) where John F. Kennedy and his surviving crew members rested after their PT boat was lost, most of us spent the allotted three hours beachcombing and snorkeling through coral gardens and schools of colorful reef fish. The scuba group explored the wreck of the Toa Maru, a well-preserved, 140-meter-long Japanese freighter. Sunk by an American torpedo, the intact ship 's remains includes crockery, unopened sake bottles, a motorcycle and several tanks. Given a second day, I 'd have also opted to explore the former Japanese military bases at Munda and Gizo. <p> In the course of a full day on Espiritu Santo Island, Vanuatu, we began with a short march down the ghostly, coral-rock runway of the abandoned " Bomber Three " airfield in the hills above Luganville. Later, we climbed through coastal jungle to inspect the wreckage of a B-17 hit during a raid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its way back to home base - at Bomber Three. We fingered( but put back) half-century- old shards of mess hall china and soda bottles washed up along Million Dollar Point, a postwar dumping ground for surplus military equipment.( Citing the economy, Congress refused to let the materiel back in this country. The colonial French, hoping to get it for nothing, refused to buy. In the end, American commanders ordered dishes, jeeps, planes and trucks thrown off the end of a long jetty.) <p> After a swim on pristine Lope Lope Beach, and a riverside buffet of coconut crabs, fish, tough local beef, papaya and rice, we drove through flourishing cattle ranches under coconut palms, then explored Luganville. Unlike Honiara, the town is a funky, charming collection - open-air market, French bakery, Chinese stores, war-era Quonset huts and, everywhere, flowers. <p> The scuba crew, meanwhile, made multiple trips to the wreck of the President Coolidge, a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back aboard the Disco, war-oriented reading was much in vogue. A single copy of Robert D. Ballard 's " The Lost Ships of Guadalcanal "( Warner Books, 1993) had been brought along. The photographic record of deep dives to the fleet of warships over which we sailed was passed from hand to hand like a sacred text. <p> Faded snapshots also were handed around - of sailors taking a break on a Guadalcanal beach in 1943 ; of an April 1944 Seder on Efate, where Australian matzo crackers were used ; of swaggering young GIs whose unlined faces appeared as backwardly telescoped versions of the snappy codgers sitting across the table. <p> No, it was n't all war, war, war. One afternoon, the ship slowly tracked a pod of sperm whales. For several days, Jean-Marie Leye Leganau, president of Vanuatu, was aboard, turning the Disco into a ship of state. With him, we witnessed an extraordinary ceremony on Ambrym Island in which " Rom " spirit dancers - seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a highland forest to symbolically threaten and imbue the Olal Village chief with their magic. <p> Arrangements were n't all perfect, either. Society Expeditions provided neither a military historian nor a lecturer on the traditional culture of the islands visited. Instead, we were subjected to talks on Easter Island, modern Pacific development and the wildlife of Australia and Antarctica. <p> But the top moments were really tops. An hour before docking at Guadalcanal, the captain shut down the ship 's engines. Veterans Silber and Landis and two German officers dropped wreaths overboard in commemoration of all who rest in Iron Bottom Sound. <p> There was a minute of silence and a round of salutes. Then the tearful Bernie Silber looked up and laughed. " You see how the world war changed things? " he said. " What you have here is both sides represented - beginning with two Jews on a German ship. " <p> We all laughed. <p> Elliott Mackle, the Journal-Constitution 's dining critic, is an Air Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
