5016541 <p> The actor who made Jon Snow an indelible piece of pop culture history admits to feeling " quite defiant " in the face of relentless fan backlash about the HBO hit 's final season. <p> " Whatever critic spends half an hour writing about this season and makes their judgement on it, in my head they can go f -- k themselves, " he tells Esquire. " Because I know how much work was put into this. " <p> He goes on to apologize( " I do n't mean to sound mean about critics ") but says the show means far too much to him to let it be dragged mercilessly. <p> " A lot of jobs, everyone goes back to their apartments at the end of the day. They have their lives and they have their families and they have their girlfriends or boyfriends back home, " Harington says. " I think part of what made ' GoT ' successful was the fact that we got on like a family. Everyone who came in was welcomed into the family. " <p> Alas, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had even aired, disgruntled fans were already calling for a do-over. More than 1.2 million keyboard warriors have " signed " a Change.org petition demanding a remake of the last season. <p> " David Benioff and D.B. Weiss have proven themselves to be woefully incompetent writers when they have no source material( i.e. the books) to fall back on, " rages petition launcher Dylan D., of Fort Worth, Texas. " This series deserves a final season that makes sense. Subvert my expectations and make it happen, HBO! " <p> The Post has reached out to HBO for comment. <p> Benioff and Weiss are taking quite the digital drubbing over what diehard fans consider a lazy last effort. The backlash started brewing with complaints about the too-dark-to-see Battle of Winterfell and gained steam right up until " Coffeegate " -- when a Starbucks-like coffee cup was accidentally left in a scene. <p> The digital dragging reached its boiling point when a promo image in which Jaime Lannister 's( Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) severed right hand appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewers went in hard. <p> " Jaime 's hand magically healed in Episode 5, " one fan groused in a since-deleted tweet. " As if we needed any more proof D&amp;D simply stopped caring about GoT a log sic time ago. " <p> Viewers who felt the finale did n't deliver can always look forward to the first of four prequel spinoffs in the works at HBO. The new series reportedly is filming in Belfast under the working title " Bloodmoon. "
