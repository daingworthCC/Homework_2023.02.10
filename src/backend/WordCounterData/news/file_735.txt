4195641 <p> The Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Nominating Committee, currently led by former Rolling Stones critic and Bruce Springsteen manager Jon Landau, who 's been part of the panel for 30 years, may have thought it was avoiding at least some of the potential rows by naming a whopping 19 nominees for the Class of 2018. <p> Pshaw. <p> Fans of Jethro Tull, Brian Eno, Todd Rundgren, the Pixies, the Smiths, Iron Maiden, the Doobie Brothers and Janet Jackson, among others, were quick to assail the list of hopefuls. It 's all politics, baby. <p> Well, maybe not ALL politics, but it 'd be pretty easy to argue that case, considering that Landau also once managed nominee MC5. Or that committee member Tom Morello is a member of nominee Rage Against the Machine. Both are Rock Hall-worthy, but just as it in the newspaper business, the appearance of a conflict of interest is just as bad as a real conflict of interest. <p> Nearly half of the group - most notably the Moody Blues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been nominated. <p> On its own website fan voting, the Rock Hall is taking a bit of a beating in that regard : The Moodies are No. 2 behind Bon Jovi ; Mark Knopfler and his Dire Straits band mates are third ; the Cars, featuring the late Clevelander Ben Orr, are in fourth place ; and Rob Halford 's metal pioneers are No. 5. <p> So, does this mean the Rock Hall and/or the Nominating Committee are out of touch with the fans? <p> Well, DUH! Of course they are. Or rather, were. <p> For the longest time, we 've all known that it 's a few at the top - most notably Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame co-founder and Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner - who are in control. <p> But that 's changing now. It began with the inductions of longtime fan favorites Rush and KISS. More and more, the Hall of Fame has taken a more populist view. Thankfully, not TOO populist. Otherwise, Janet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt she 's had a decent career, being the sister of the King of Pop is not a Hall of Fame credential. <p> So, the question is whether the 900 or so actual voters - whose ranks include all the surviving Hall of Famers, plus a select number of critics, publicists, managers, label heads, historians and other industry insiders - will heed the fan vote or follow the lead of veteran Hall of Famers Fleetwood Mac and, ahem, go their own way. <p> Keep in mind that the fan vote counts as a single ballot among the 900. So that could totally discount the million fan endorsements Bon Jovi probably will have by the time the voting ends a minute before midnight on Dec. 5. Simple math shows that if Jon Bon Jovi and his band mates DO get a million votes, each fan 's ballot will be worth 0.0009 votes. Yep, we matter. <p> There 's a big " but " there, though. The Rock Hall under museum President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peresman have become increasingly conscious of public opinion. <p> The museum in particular, while officially a nonprofit, by its accounts has become a big moneymaker for itself and the city in its 20-plus years, having brought more than $2 billion to the Cleveland economy. And the 2018 ceremonies actually are IN Cleveland, which makes for a potential public relations and cash register bonanza. <p> So, as much as snooty types like to dismiss the hair metal - and, quite honestly chintzy - music of Bon Jovi, they 'll get in. I certainly hope so, if for no other reason than to see if Richie Sambora will show up and play with ex-band mates, and thereby fuel yet another round of will-he-or-won't-he rejoin them for another tour. <p> I also believe the voters have been shamed into acknowledging the Moody Blues ' accomplishments and will induct the band. Wenner 's anti-prog rock bias has long been a factor in the exclusion of the genre. It 's still unconscionable to me - a fan of prog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> But the undeniable fan support for the Moodies - and before them, Yes and Rush - means it 's time to realize that those days of censure have passed, to mangle the title of the band 's groundbreaking album. <p> Metal fans would like to believe that Judas Priest will make it this time around, too. That could happen, but I 'd say that among the leaders in fan voting, that is least likely. Again, not because the band does n't deserve it... eventually. But there are other metal groups I would put in first, tops among them Motorhead. It 'd be a good - and fair - fight between Priest, Iron Maiden, Slayer, Pantera and Anthrax for next up. <p> But I will say this : If Priest DOES get in and anyone other than Akron 's Tim " Ripper " Owens, who subbed for Halford for a while after being discovered in a Priest cover band, presents them, the Rock Hall leadership should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kitty tattoos. <p> I do think there will be a little " insider trading, ' ' and Morello 's Rage Against the Machine will make it this time around, too, even though the band has received only about a third as many votes as Dire Straits, the Cars and Priest. Fact is, Morello is one of the most gifted artists of his generation, and a guy who graduated cum laude from Harvard with a degree in political science probably is a pretty convincing negotiator. <p> Knopfler 's fans are legion, as witnessed by the tally in the online voting, but the Cars had a better, more extensive catalog, at least in my judgment. Plus, as I said before, the ceremonies will be in Cleveland, and the late Cars bassist and singer Benjamin Orzechowski was born in Lakewood. It 'll come down to one or the other, with the Cars in the driver 's seat, so to speak. <p> And because the Rock Hall voters just love to throw curves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone from the Eurythmics( just because I 'd love to hear Annie Lennox sing ANYTHING) to Depeche Mode to the J. Geils Band to LL Cool J. The straw I pulled came out in favor of Peter Wolf &amp; Co., in large part because the band is still kicking butt and taking names. <p> So my five will be Bon Jovi, the Moody Blues, the Cars, Rage Against the Machine and the J. Geils Band.
