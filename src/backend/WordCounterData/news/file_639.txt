4137841 The Austin school district has lost 2,000 students in the past two years - the only back-to-back slip in enrollment in at least two decades, and perhaps ever. The loss of 735 students this year pushes enrollment back to the 2008 level of 84,791 students, and if the demographers are right, it is just the beginning of an erosion that could continue for the next decade - and lead to a number of problems. Declining enrollment may be a sign that middle-class families are giving up on city schools. Enrollment in Austin 's charter schools and area suburbs has increased steadily as the district 's enrollment dwindles. Less students also means less money from the state. In other Texas cities, these kinds of declines have led to greater percentages of low-income, minority students in urban public schools, and lower academic performance that further convinces middle- and upper-class families to find alternatives. Up until last year, Austin was one of the few urban districts in Texas that continued to see steady enrollment gains, partly fueled by its strong economy and population growth. " We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dallas and Fort Worth, " said Ryan Robinson, the city of Austin demographer. " We 're going to be challenged to hang on to our school-aged enrollment, no doubt about it. " Last year, the district lost more than 1,200 students. District officials can not recall another time that enrollment dropped for two years in a row. But while the enrollment losses came &shy; faster than Austin school officials expected, they have recently been &shy; employing countermeasures, and there are signs that some of them are working. Work to turn around the struggling Eastside Memorial has resulted in double-digit gains in its graduation rate, and helped boost enrollment by 140 students this year. Reagan High School &shy; also has seen gains since the school began offering an early college program that allows students to earn college credit as early as their freshman year, and gives them a chance to earn an associate degree along with their high school diploma. Blackshear Elementary opened in August with a fine arts academy, which helped attract another 53 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cruz said the district is going to examine the gains and losses campus by campus and has charged advisory councils to work with parents to identify solutions for underenrollment or overcrowding. " Austin is a very rich, diverse community and we are not a one-size-fits-all( district) by any stretch, " Cruz said. " Our parents want to make sure we 're listening to them and we are. We 're not developing the strategies from the district office, but at the campus level where the work really is. " The district also is going door to door targeting families with children who qualify for free Pre-K. School district administrators and demographers attribute the enrollment declines to a number of factors, including escalating housing costs, flight to suburban districts and charter schools, and birth rates that declined with the 2008 recession. Diana Nokes was an active parent in the Austin district, serving on the committee to plan for a future South Austin high school, and as PTA president for her daughter 's school. She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's middle school combines Pre-Advanced Placement students like her daughter in the same classes as other students. Her daughter breezed through her first year. Bringing change to the school would take too long, Nokes said, because the district is " an industrial-sized organization. " She said the district throws its efforts behind low-performing schools, and has focused little on pushing other schools to higher academic performance. " That 's the issue with AISD. It 's too big, " Nokes said. " The standard of education was put on the back burner, especially in Southwest Austin. " So, the Nokeses moved to the 4,000-student Dripping Springs district. " What I like is... the superintendent is involved in solving problems, " she said. Local charter schools, which have grown 13 percent to more than 14,000 students this year, also have lured families. While students are moving out of the district, some of the growth experienced by the city of Austin has brought new students in, curbing the loss. District @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2012-13 but did not enroll in the 2013-14, 47 percent moved to neighboring districts, down about 5 percentage points from the year prior. Another 24 percent left for area charter schools, up more than 3 percentage points from the year prior. The district still is gathering data to determine where the students who were in the district last year went. The greatest loss this year was among elementary-aged &shy; students, a group that shrank by more than 900, with 66 percent of those Pre-K students. Middle schools lost 320 students and high schools gained nearly 460. Escalating housing costs are another factor driving families out. The average market value of homes within the Austin school district is $313,996, compared to the average market values of homes in Del Valle at $114,415, Hays at $140,814, Pflugerville at $157,383 and Round Rock at $243,984 - four of the area districts where families who leave the Austin district most often move. " There are factors that we can control and factors we ca n't control, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " During the recession, we started to see a dip in the birth rate, and that is affecting us now. We ca n't control the rise in costs of housing in Austin. And a lot of young families are having to go outside of AISD to find affordable housing. " At about $7,400 apiece in state funding, the decline of 735 students could result in a loss of more than $5.4 million, and further exasperate the district 's budget constraints. A handful of parents and community members are organizing grassroots efforts to stop the bleeding. Using the national model Parents for Public Schools, they attempting to start an Austin chapter to market the district 's strengths - including its signature programs - and its better overall performance compared to other urban districts. The parents said that while there is strong parent support in the district, it is usually found in silos, either campus- or issue-based. The group 's desire is to develop parent leaders to get the information out and tout the district. Contact Melissa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Superintendent Paul Cruz on Monday will present the 2014 State of the District address, which will feature a report on the district 's performance and future, including the enrollment rates, the budget and the effect of the state 's school finance system on the district.
