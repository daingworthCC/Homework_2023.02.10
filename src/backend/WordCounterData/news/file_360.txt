3061441 <p> This is not a sad day. Magic Johnson retiring from basketball because he was HIV-positive, that was a sad day. <p> This is a day when Michael Jordan, in good health and of his own volition, will do exactly what he said he would do for exactly the reason he said he would do it : He will retire from the Bulls because Phil Jackson no longer is their coach. <p> " Do n't call my bluff, " Jordan warned last summer, but that is what the Bulls did. So Jordan retired. <p> All the ambiguity that arose after Jordan 's initial announcement -- all the hints that maybe he would n't retire after all -- now can be seen as a product of Jordan 's willingness to be a good soldier during the NBA lockout. He allowed the players association to use his possible return as a bargaining chip, something that might induce the owners to compromise. <p> For his trouble, Jordan and his agent, David Falk, were widely scolded as greedy and arrogant by management. In light of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stern begging him to come back hilarious. <p> But in the end, it all comes back to Jackson. People close to Jordan understand better than the rest of us just how attached to his coach he truly was. Jerry Reinsdorf understood this, too, and he also understood that Jackson and Jerry Krause could not work together. Yet Reinsdorf chose Krause, which meant Jackson would not come back no matter how often he was asked, which meant Jordan was gone, too. <p> Though Jordan 's presence would have helped the NBA get over the trauma of the lockout, in the end the league will survive just fine. Babe Ruth retired, and so did Willie Mays. Red Grange retired, and so did Johnny Unitas. Bob Cousy retired, and so did Bill Russell. Their sports continued to prosper. <p> But enough of endings. Today, let 's remember beginnings. Let 's remember three games when Michael Jordan gave clues to what lay ahead. Let 's remember three games when Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Bobby Knight was mad it could n't be the Russians. Jon Koncak 's sister was so worried he would n't get into the game, she spelled out his name with a locomotive cheer until Knight finally let him play. And Jordan forgot his uniform. <p> The gold-medal game of the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles was n't the most thrilling Jordan ever played -- the Soviets were absent because of a boycott, so Spain was served up as a sacrificial offering -- but on several levels, there were indications of what the future had to offer. <p> Jordan, who had forgotten his uniform in the Olympic Village, got it back when an Inglewood policeman volunteered to race over from the Forum and pick it up. A Los Angeles police helicopter, suspicious of the speeding car, made the return trip in hot pursuit, and not until the two departments made their peace did Jordan get his uniform. <p> The final score was 96-65 -- Spain went nine minutes without a field goal at one point -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophical. " It 's clear like consomme soup that the United States is 50 years ahead of all the other basketball teams in the world, " he said though an interpreter. " I would trade Patrick Ewing or Michael Jordan for all my players. Either one. " <p> Who is the most valuable player on the American team? someone asked. <p> " MEE-guel CHOR-dan, " Diaz-Miguel said in his native tongue. <p> " Mee-SHEL Jor-DAN, " the French interpreter translated. <p> " Michael Jordan, " the English translator said. <p> " Not a difficult question for me, " said Diaz-Miguel, who spoke a fair amount of English after all. <p> Not a difficult question for the rest of the world -- English-speaking or not -- in the years to come, either. <p> Oct. 29, 1984 -- There were 9,356 paying customers at Chicago Stadium to see the Bulls play Milwaukee. It was the third game of Jordan 's NBA career, too early to use a word like disappointment but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft choices as Sidney Green, Quintin Dailey and Kelvin Ransey to wonder what all the fuss was about. <p> Jordan had scored 16 points in his first game against Washington, 21 against the Bucks in Milwaukee, and after sitting on the bench with four fouls through most of the third quarter of this game, he had an uninspiring total of 15 points. The Bulls trailed by nine. <p> And then, as if somebody had turned on a switch, Jordan became a basketball giant before our eyes. He stole the ball, drove for breakaway layups, hit jump shots from in front of the basket, from the side and from the baseline. And after getting the screaming crowd on its feet with what appeared to be an out-of-control windmill shot from the side, Jordan converted a three-point play that gave the Bulls the lead. <p> Milwaukee went ahead again on its next possession, but then Jordan did something I never have seen before or since. I can not say with certainty it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but I ca n't think of anything that tops it, either. <p> Jordan took the inbounds pass and found the entire Milwaukee team, which had seen quite enough for one quarter, lined up like fence posts along the floor to stop him. Jordan drove through them all. <p> Head fake, hip fake, shoulder fake, stop-and-start dribble, spin move until the only thing between Jordan and the basket was Sidney Moncrief, the two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year. Jordan went over him and dunked. <p> The Bulls won the game by six points as Jordan finished the quarter with 22 -- a team record for the fourth quarter -- and the game with 37. It was the first time he led the Bulls in scoring, and the first time he gave Chicago fans a clue of the riches they had in store. <p> June 5, 1991 -- This one is personal. It is about adding a moment to a small shining collection of events that are stored in the safe deposit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment a dynasty is defining itself only five feet away. <p> It is about Mike Eruzione scoring the goal that beat the Russians, Jack Nicklaus coming up the 18th fairway at Augusta, Nolan Ryan pitching a no-hitter and striking out 17 batters, Willie Shoemaker winning the Derby on a 17-1 shot. It is about Michael Jordan going around Sam Perkins. <p> The Bulls lost their first Finals game to the Lakers in 1991, but now they were in control. As the crowd at the Stadium roared, they were beating Los Angeles badly. Early in the fourth quarter, Jordan took a pass from Cliff Levingston, drove to within a few feet of where I was sitting beyond the baseline, pulled up and rose above Perkins, the Lakers ' 6-9 forward. <p> Perkins went up to meet him, but at the final instant, Jordan brought the ball back down, slipped it from his right hand to his left, reached around Perkins, under the basket and, applying just enough spin, flipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the signature moment of the Bulls ' first victory in the NBA Finals -- they wrapped up the title with three straight victories in Los Angeles -- and every time I see it replayed on television, I wonder if I am in the picture. If only I could take my eyes off Jordan.
