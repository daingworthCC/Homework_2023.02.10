3001241 <p> Central New Jersey, an international center of the pharmaceutical industry, is being pushed to center stage in the United States ' campaign to contain health costs. <p> Scattered across the state 's midsection -- in the rolling hills here, the corporate campuses of Princeton, the urban clutter of New Brunswick and elsewhere -- is the world 's largest concentration of companies that create and market prescription drugs, companies whose steady growth and investment have been the envy of other corporations even in recessionary years. <p> Now, the pharmaceutical industry finds itself under siege from insurers, hospitals, Congress and the Clinton Administration, which calls the containment of health-care costs a major priority in its fight to reduce the Federal deficit. On Friday, the President singled out the industry for criticism, calling its prices " shocking " and saying drug companies are spending too much on advertising and lobbying. <p> In New Jersey, sometimes called the medicine chest of the nation because it is home to the main research arms of 10 of the world 's 18 largest drug companies, the big question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can continue to stand out as models of growth, profitability and, by many measures, community involvement. Fear of Turning Gray <p> Some fear that economic and political pressure will transform the industry from a cutting-edge producer of high-technology products into just another graying American manufacturer. That has threatening implications across a region reeling from huge manufacturing job losses, including the impending shutdown of the General Motors assembly plant in Tarrytown, N.Y., and thousands of layoffs by I.B.M. <p> In what some analysts call an omen for the industry, Bristol-Myers Squibb said in October that it was cutting 2,000 jobs in its pharmaceutical group, based in Princeton. <p> New Federal regulations, combined with fierce competition in the industry, " are going to drive the margins out of the pharmaceutical business over the next five years, " said Raymond C. Egan, executive vice president of the Bristol-Myers Squibb group, which has 38,000 employees. <p> Although fewer than 300 people would be laid off in New Jersey, where the pharmaceutical group has 6,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state through attrition. ' Pressure on Prices ' <p> " There is certainly going to be increased pressure on prices, and adjustments have to be made, " said Patricia Danzon, a professor of health-care management at the University of Pennsylvania 's Wharton School of Business. <p> She said cuts may come first in administration and sales. Other experts expect cuts in research and development, which, like administration and sales, are heavily concentrated in New Jersey. <p> " The health-care industry in the United States has been the most innovative in the world, " said Jack Herdklotz, the president of Hoechst-Roussel Pharmaceuticals, a German company that built its Somerville headquarters in 1970. It is completing work on a $20 million molecular neurobiology research center here to develop drugs for Alzheimer 's disease and other disorders. Traditions of Involvement <p> He said that to contain costs, Hoechst-Roussel was considering producing more generic drugs, and relying more on licensing or other cooperative ventures with outside laboratories and researchers. <p> Cutbacks could affect more than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies have long traditions of community involvement in New Jersey. <p> In New Brunswick, a once-declining industrial city where Johnson &; Johnson built a new headquarters in 1975, the company in January opened a day-care and " parenting center " for teen-age mothers at New Brunswick High School. <p> In Nutley, Hoffmann-La Roche won an award last year from the Environmental Protection Agency, in part for its programs to recycle waste. Other drug makers have been widely cited for volunteer work and for gifts to community programs. ' The Most Admired Industry ' <p> In its current issue, Fortune Magazine calls pharmaceutical makers " the most admired industry " in the United States and singles out four New Jersey drug makers for praise : Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, Johnson &; Johnson, Bristol-Myers Squibb and the Schering-Plough Corporation, based in Madison. <p> Brenda J. Bacon, who is Gov. Jim Florio 's chief of management planning and his top adviser on health-care issues, said, " We need health-care reform, but not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure the Clinton Administration does not want to solve one problem by creating another. " <p> The debate over how to contain medical costs is creating political headaches for Mr. Florio and his administration. Although he is a close political ally of Mr. Clinton, the Governor is under pressure from his own state 's pharmaceutical executives to carry their message to Washington. <p> Ms. Bacon said Mr. Florio planned to meet with top pharmaceutical executives the week of Feb. 14. She said he would urge them to agree to voluntary limits on price increases for prescription drugs, but only if the same limits were agreed to by the entire pharmaceutical industry. Division on Price Limits <p> So far, two of the New Jersey companies -- Merck and Hoffman La Roche -- have told state officials they would agree to voluntary limits, in which their prices for drugs already on the market would not be raised above the consumer price index. Others have balked, saying the idea is too broad and leaves them no flexibility in pricing drugs that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug makers were having problems even earlier. Bristol-Myers Squibb, the only major New Jersey pharmaceutical maker that has announced job cuts in recent years, complains about a set of Federal rules made in the Bush Administration requiring pharmaceutical companies to charge Medicaid recipients no more for their drugs than they charge large-volume buyers. <p> That law has forced some companies to repay large amounts to state Medicaid programs. Bristol-Myers Squibb said it would owe Medicaid $100 million in rebates this year. <p> The drug companies have been squeezed by a growing reliance on health maintenance organizations, which vigorously negotiated discounts on prescription medications by buying them in bulk. And they have felt pressure from large hospitals and clinics, which have adopted limits on what they will pay for drugs. Convenience or Low Cost <p> One result has been a rapid increase in the use of generic drugs, which cost far less than their brand-name counterparts, or medications that may require patients to sacrifice convenience for lower costs. For instance, many customers are opting for drugs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month, the Clinton Administration said that it would favor a Federal program to buy vaccines en masse for the lowest price possible, and provide them free for school immunization programs. <p> In a report to the Senate that was bitterly contested by the industry, researchers concluded that several companies that had pledged not to raise their prices faster than the rate of inflation had done so in 1992. <p> " This report adds to the mounting evidence that voluntary price restraints simply do n't work, " said Sen. David Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat. Among those singled out were Merck and American Home Products. Vast Profits in 1980 's <p> Despite the mounting economic and political heat, industry analysts say they doubt that the nation 's largest pharmaceutical companies will veer far from the strategies that produced vast profits in the 1980 's. <p> " The lifeblood of the industry is new products, " said Robert Hodgeson, a health care analyst for Cowan and Company in Boston. " These companies will be looking for efficiencies, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " <p> That may help New Jersey, which has become a global vortex of drug research. A study by Hal P. Eastman, associate dean of the graduate school of management at Rutgers University, found that the state 's large pharmaceutical companies increased their annual research and development budgets nearly fourfold in the 1980 's, to a total of $1.93 billion in 1990. <p> " Our most important approach is still to find breakthrough therapies, " said Timothy G. Rothwell, president and chief executive officer of Sandoz, the United States subsidiary of a diversified Swiss chemical and drug concern, which established its base in East Hanover during the early 1950 's. <p> Despite the potential threat from new Federal regulations, Mr. Rothwell said the company needed access to American scientists, hospitals and clinical trials. By the end of the 1990 's, he said, it will increase its staff of scientists to 1500 from 600, and its overall employment in East Hanover to 4,000 from 2,500. <p> " We know the environment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " he said. " But our intent is not to slow down.
