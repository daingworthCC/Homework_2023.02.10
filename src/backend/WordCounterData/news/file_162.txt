3032641 <p> The moment was so typical of what has become traditional in Washington area high school sports : The DeMatha basketball team, trailing by 17 points to Dunbar in the City Title Game earlier this month at Cole Field House, rallied to win, 72-71. <p> Last weekend, the Stags basketball team went to Cumberland, Md., won the Alhambra tournament and finished 30-0. <p> Of course DeMatha won. DeMatha always wins, or at least that is the perception. <p> It is a perception of which the Hyattsville school of 760 boys is proud, and one it hopes to perpetuate. For years DeMatha has been successful in basketball, football and baseball. Recently, success has touched just about every team DeMatha fields. <p> But success has its price. Some schools are dropping DeMatha from their schedules -- notably in football and wrestling -- and others are considering it. Some coaches wonder how so many good athletes wind up at the school. There is even the long-term consideration that if DeMatha gets too strong in too many sports, it could outgrow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I still do n't have an opener for this year and there are still three Montgomery schools with open dates, " said football coach Bill McGregor, whose team finished 9-1 last season and had 14 seniors sign Division I letters-of-intent. " That is one of the reasons we have to go out of town for games. I agree with some of the public schools that wo n't play us because, in Maryland, it counts as part of their state points that determine playoff berths. I think a lot of schools perceive us as being big, strong DeMatha and that they will get banged up and hurt. But if you look at our roster, we are not bigger than a lot of teams around. " <p> Lately, the wrestling( five straight Metro titles) and baseball( four Metro titles in the past six years) teams have had scheduling problems. This fall and winter, 13 DeMatha teams -- including junior varsity and freshman -- compiled a 167-31-3 overall record. Eleven teams had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not always that way. In the mid-1950s, DeMatha withdrew from the Catholic League because the school was not competitive. In 1956, Morgan Wootten was hired as football and basketball coach, beginning the DeMatha sports revolution. Since 1962, 27 Stags have gone on to play professional basketball, football or baseball. Since 1986, 99 have gone on to play college athletics. Wootten said every senior basketball player since 1957 has been offered a college scholarship. <p> " I have heard people mention that maybe the league would be better off if DeMatha was not in it, " said Gonzaga Principal Joseph Ciancaglini. " I do n't think that is the case. But it is very difficult to compete with their record and the number of kids who get college athletic scholarships, particularly off their basketball team. " <p> This is not the first time DeMatha has run into the problem of being too good for the local competition. In 1968 the Catholic League suspended play after DeMatha won the championship of just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later, most of the schools reorganized as the Metro Conference. <p> In some years, various Metro schools have not participated in certain league sports, feeling overmatched and usually citing DeMatha as a chief reason. The most recent examples were Ireton, which does not compete in the football league, and O'Connell, which stayed out of basketball competition for several seasons before rejoining five years ago. <p> DeMatha continues to build existing sports and add new ones. Lacrosse has won the last two Metro titles, and ice hockey finished 13-1 and 14-3 the last two seasons. About the only struggling DeMatha program is swimming, 1-6 this winter. <p> " When it comes to swimming, we want kids competing and enjoying themselves, " DeMatha Principal John Moylan said with a laugh, " and we are satisfied as long as no one drowns. " <p> In the past decade most members of the Metro Conference have had their sports programs affected by dramatically falling enrollments and transitions of some schools to co-ed enrollment. DeMatha, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and improved its overall athletic program to a level few schools in the area, or nation, can match. <p> " Stability, " said Gonzaga football coach Maus Collins, formerly of Carroll, in pinpointing DeMatha 's success. " It has been the leadership of Morgan Wootten and the cooperation of the administration. You do n't die from the outside ; people beat you from the inside. " <p> Wootten 's 30-0 season leaves his basketball career record at 959-135, but he also built the football program, compiling a 79-40-2 record as coach from 1956 to 1968. <p> Moylan, who has been at the school since 1956, became principal in 1968. In a role of less public celebrity, but with great importance, is Buck Offutt, who in one of his many roles during the school 's growing stages -- that of part-time athletic director -- hired Wootten and is in his fourth decade as an English teacher. <p> In addition to coaching several sports, Offutt, now an assistant football coach, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that attracts athletes hoping to leave high school with a scholarship. He said every athlete who has taken his SAT review course has met Proposition 48 guidelines for receiving a college athletic grant. <p> " College coaches just flock to us and they do because they know our kids will stay in school once they get there, " said Offutt. <p> There has long been outside skepticism on whether the school has reached the fine balance of athletics and academics, and how it was done. <p> " Everyone wants to say they recruit, they cheat, they do things that give them a competitive edge, " said Ben Spotts, who quarterbacked the Stags to a 7-6 upset of St. John 's in 1958, a game that often is called the turning point of sports at DeMatha. " No one wants to acknowledge hard work, good coaches and good kids. You ca n't do it with mirrors for 35 years. " <p> In the years after Spotts, DeMatha produced professional athletes such as football players Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenny Carr, Jerrod Mustaf and Danny Ferry ; and pitcher Steve Farr, who recently signed a lucrative free agent contract with the Yankees. <p> Alumni stay close to the school and often send their sons. Spotts 's son, Dan, became one of DeMatha 's top golfers. <p> The recruiting charge often has been directed toward DeMatha, going back to the early days of Wootten, who says he spends a lot of time turning away applicants and no time seeking them. <p> " If Morgan was in as many homes recruiting as all the stories have said he was, he would have never been home a night in his life, " said Collins. <p> There are no rules concerning outside supporters influencing students, including top athletes, to attend a particular school. Where most public and private schools are lucky to have one strong booster club, DeMatha has a separate booster organization for each of its teams. <p> One parent glad to have sent his sons to DeMatha is former Bullets general manager Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The true part of DeMatha is camouflaged by its sports teams, " he said. " Bobby went to Harvard and sometime in his senior year, we were talking. I happened to ask him who was the best teacher he ever had. His answer knocked me over. He said it was Morgan Wootten in world history. " <p> One student drawn to DeMatha because of sports was Eric Smallwood, who convinced his parents that it would be worth joining a carpool of five that drives 45 minutes each way from Riva, Md., near Annapolis. <p> " If not for baseball, I probably would have gone to another school closer to my home, " the senior center fielder said. " When I was thinking about going to a school, I saw a brochure from DeMatha. On one page, it listed all the colleges where DeMatha graduates had gone.... I was impressed. " <p> Also a two-year starter at wide receiver, Smallwood is one of six seniors from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it was not because offers were n't there. As this year 's valedictorian, with nothing less than an A in every class, he wants to attend Duke, Princeton or Virginia. Academic grants should be forthcoming. <p> Wootten perpetuates the record of players getting scholarships by encouraging all players, even the most sought-after ones, not to sign letters-of-intent during the one-week early signing period in November. <p> " That way, college recruiters keep coming to our games, " said Wootten. " They may be coming to just see one kid, but when they come, our other kids know they will be seen too. " <p> Moylan is sometimes criticized by those who resent the amount of time and energy he dedicates to everything from school sports to DeMatha 's award-winning music program. <p> " We are changing principals all the time like so many of these other schools, " said one veteran Metro coach who did not want to be identified. " They have had one principal who knows what it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DeMatha does so well. <p> Moylan 's defense is simple. <p> " Do n't criticize -- analyze, " he said. " There are administrators who do n't understand the full value of what sports can contribute. They look at the expense, but if it will make a kid work harder in English to stay athletically eligible, it is worth the expense. " <p> No school in the league has faced as many allegations of wrongdoing as far as how it obtained players at Metro Conference meetings as DeMatha. Often the discussions have filtered down to an interpretation of the league 's vague rules. <p> " DeMatha dominates the league, but they have had their wrists slapped, " said a veteran league coach. <p> Moylan says he knows some hard feelings were created over the years, but he points out DeMatha was vindicated in virtually every case. In one instance four years ago in which a league reprimand was issued, Moylan notes that a violation of the league transfer rules was not found, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " had been violated. <p> In 1965 DeMatha took on national prominence after its basketball team defeated Power Memorial High of New York and star Lew Alcindor( later known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar). Since then, Wootten has taken his basketball team across the country. The football team has gone to Massachusetts the past two years to meet nationally ranked Brockton. Next year Coach Dick Messier plans to have his wrestling team compete in a Los Angeles tournament. <p> DeMatha keeps annual tuition( currently $ 3,100) lower than most area private schools. Its athletic teams go on out-of-town trips only when expenses are guaranteed. The football and baseball teams practice at public parks. <p> School visitors are shocked at the no-frills, but historic, home court of the basketball team. <p> " The gym is right where I want it to be, " said Moylan. " It is like music. If we need an auditorium for a concert, there are plenty right around here I could rent. Our gym is perfect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you need something for $ 2 million which we might fill four or five times a year? If we need something bigger for a big game, we can rent one. It is cheaper and it helps keep the tuition down. " <p> A $ 4.1 million addition for the school completed this year included offices, classrooms, a media center and specialized music rooms. The gym received minimal renovation -- the floor was resurfaced and a small set of bleachers was added. <p> Whatever DeMatha has done, it has been enough to satisfy Wootten. <p> Often rumored under consideration for big-time college positions, he might have taken the top job at Maryland on two occasions -- before Lefty Driesell and Bob Wade were hired -- but was not made an offer. The only other temptation came in 1980 when North Carolina State offered a $ 700,000-per-year package. <p> " I sat in my office looking at this long list and someone came into my office, " recalled Wootten. " I said, ' Look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' After all this time, you are going to start doing it just for the money? ' He did n't have to say any more. I knew he was right. " <p> With the national scope, a large following and a love-them-or-hate-them aura, DeMatha has been referred to as the Notre Dame of high schools. <p> " I absolutely like that comparison, and I think we are there, " said Moylan. " We are like Notre Dame, or Duke, where there is a mixture of academics with athletics. We do n't try hard to win. We try to play hard and winning usually comes as a result. "
