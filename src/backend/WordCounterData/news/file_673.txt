4189141 <p> 2. Vikings( 5-0) - Off the No. 1 spot despite not playing last week. Why? The five teams they 've beaten all looked unremarkable Sunday. Wins over Carolina and Green Bay are n't as impressive as we initially thought. <p> 4. Falcons( 4-2) - Impressive in defeat at Seattle, they move up a spot. Who says there 's no such thing as a good loss? <p> 5. Seahawks( 4-1) - Winning games like Sunday 's are huge, because no team benefits from home field in the playoffs more than Seattle. Tough schedule continues. <p> 6. Broncos( 4-2) - With no coach, and a banged-up QB, they lost to the best bad team in NFL history( San Diego) last Thursday night. Not the worst loss, but there are some red flags in their consecutive defeats. <p> 7. Steelers( 4-2) - Would be willing to toss out their game at Miami, except that the Steelers are always due for three or four of those a season. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones. <p> 6. Saints at Chiefs( 1 p.m.) - The Saints could easily be 4-1 or 0-5 ; the Chiefs put together their best game of the season last week. <p> 7. Colts at Titans( 1 p.m.) - Asked about the AFC South being the NFL 's worst division, Texans coach Bill O'Brien defensively responded, " Whoever says that has never coached or played football. " That explains my opinions. But this game could get the mediocre Titans one step closer to O'Brien 's No. 1 spot in the standings. <p> 4. Ryan Mallett- Might the Ravens call on No. 7 this week against the Jets?... <p> 5. Geno Smith-... Well, the Jets are calling on No. 7 this week against the Ravens. <p> 6. Luke McCown- He 's played once in the last four years, but that one game was a 335-yard performance against the eventual NFC champions last year. <p> 7. Jacoby Brissett- The Patriots ' third-stringer beats Colin Kaepernick for the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kap has n't won since this time last year( against the Ravens).
