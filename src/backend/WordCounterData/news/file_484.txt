4086641 Training camp, besides the smelly team bonding that can only occur when you make 80 guys live together for three weeks, is about work. Two practices a day, meetings and tucking yourself in with your playbook at night. # There 's especially heavy lifting when, like the Oakland Raiders, you have n't won more than five games in a season in seven years. On Thursday, the Raiders put on pads and open up camp in Napa, and they 're a reinvigorated, optimistic bunch on the heels of what was a productive offseason. # First, by all accounts, they had a successful draft - and it 's the first time anyone has said that about Oakland in a long time. Then, in a two-part move, the Raiders traded for quarterback Jason Campbell and later cut 280-pound albatross JaMarcus Russell, arguably the biggest and most expensive $39 million bust in the history of the NFL. # " He 's a good quarterback, " receiver Chaz Schilens said of Campbell. " He 's smart, throws a good ball and I have felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " # The former Redskins quarterback is the starter, no matter what team officials say about a four-man competition for the No. 1 job. Bruce Gradkowski should solidify his hold on the backup job, while Kyle Boller and Charlie Frye battle it out for No. 3. # Campbell is not one of the six Raiders players - listed below - on the spot as camp opens for the simple reason that he is such a huge upgrade over Russell. Oakland 's offensive players are starved for attention - 197 points last season, second worst in the league. Meanwhile, Campbell 's decision-making, professionalism and accuracy 64.5 percent last year have already won over the hearts of his offensive linemen and receivers. # So, who are the six players who will demand the most attention in Napa? Without a lot of wide-open battles for starting spots, the focus has to be on the trenches. That 's where Raiders defensive players were trampled and where their offensive linemen did n't do Russell, Gradkowski and Frye any favors last season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of futility, the Raiders have never finished higher than 22nd against the run. They hope they have found their man to plug the middle in the 6-foot-7, 335 pound Henderson, a 31-year-old veteran whom Jacksonville cut despite finishing seventh against the run last season. # Some scouts say Henderson is washed up, but the Raiders are n't asking him to do that much - just play first and second downs and occupy offensive linemen so that rookie inside linebacker Rolando McClain can roam and make plays behind him. # These are your starters on Day One in Napa for an offensive line that Yahoo! Sports recently called the worst in the league. # Henderson is a good athlete who played well at the end of 2008 but struggled mightily last season. His eight blown blocks that led to sacks were third worst among tackles. He worked hard in the offseason and feels he owes coach Tom Cable, whom he calls " a father figure. " # Walker is back for another stint, and the Cal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds. He looked fresh at minicamp and quickly moved into the lineup, dispatching Khalif Barnes to get some work at guard. Walker 's emergence could also signal a lot more power blocking under new offensive coordinator Hue Jackson, in addition to the zone blocking that Cable favored. # Third-round pick Jared Veldheer is a project but could be in the mix by the end of the season if Henderson and Walker struggle. # Someone 's going to get the departed Justin Fargas 129 carries, and one has to think it will be Bush. He averaged 4.5 yards per carry last season and has the team 's last three 100-yard games in a 17-game span. He runs hard and has shown an ability to do something that counterpart Darren McFadden has n't : break a tackle. # McFadden is a blur in practice, and Cable said he has improved on the tackle-breaking and his penchant for fumbling. Still, Bush should have every opportunity to push McFadden into a third-down role. # The Raiders acquired the former defensive end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of 14 former first-round picks on the Raiders, Wimbley has the speed to be an elite pass-rusher 11 sacks in 2006, but will be used off the ball a little more. # Wimbley, McClain and Trevor Scott will have to show they can cover a running back or tight end, but Cable will accept some struggles there if Wimbley and Co. make plays. " He 's going to bring a lot to the table for us, " Cable said. # He looks the part of a top-flight difference maker but has not been able to stay healthy. The 6-foot-4 Schilens did come back sooner than expected from another foot surgery and participated in summer workouts. With the improved Darrius Heyward-Bey and fluid Louis Murphy, a healthy Schilens would give the Raiders a decent, young receiving corps with some upside. It 's not just players who are on the spot during training camp, of course. It 's coaches, too. In the Raiders case, the coaches in focus are head coach Tom Cable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Cable had to relinquish play-calling duties to Jackson, the former Ravens quarterback coach, in order to keep the head coaching job. Whether that 's true or not, both men seemed comfortable in their new roles at minicamp and summer workouts. Jackson loudly chastised defensive players, while encouraging his offensive players between plays. " He wants us to become a bully, " tackle Mario Henderson said. " Just kick ass. " Cable took a back seat and said he enjoyed overseeing all aspects of the team and jotting down notes. " Now he can sit back and really scope out the team and see the areas that we need to fix and see what needs to get better, " cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha said. " It helps having him in this role where he can say, ' Look, you take care of the offense, and I 'll take care of this team as a whole. " Cable is the first Raiders coach to complete two seasons in a row since Norv Turner left in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalties and non-JaMarcus Russell mistakes. If the Raiders can improve on last year 's 17 touchdowns - tied for worst in the league - and finish.500, there will be plenty of credit for go around for both Cable and Jackson. # First practices # 6 p.m. at Dallas # 5:30
