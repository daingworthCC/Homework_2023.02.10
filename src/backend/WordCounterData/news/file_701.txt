4191941 <h> We separate the art from the artist all the time. <p> Nate Parker at a benefit in Los Angeles on Aug. 11.( Willy Sanjuan/Invision/AP) <p> Yes, I know : 15 years ago, " Birth of a Nation " star and filmmaker Nate Parker was acquitted on charges of rape and sexual assault. But though a jury concluded that he was n't guilty of a crime, I ca n't help believe that he used a woman who he knew was vulnerable. <p> He 's repugnant. But that does n't mean I wo n't go see his movie. <p> I get where the writer Roxanne Gay is coming from when she says she " can not separate the art and the artist, " but I can. I -- we -- do it all the time, and unless we 're going to start boycotting every tainted artist 's work, we 're hypocrites. I may think Parker, the person, is a lowlife, but he has produced a work of art that I 'm perfectly content to buy a ticket for, take in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hailed as " reflective, " " vigorous " and " vital. " Now it 's being ripped as " overdone " and a historically inaccurate " epic fail. " I say, let 's see. It will either succeed or fail on its own merit, or lack thereof, but that should n't have anything to do with Parker 's sordid past. <p> We consume and experience films( and music, and, for that matter, sports) for many reasons. To be enlightened, to be entertained, to experience beauty and grapple with ugliness. As human beings, we need this, emotionally and intellectually. And while the artists who offer this to us are linked to their work -- it 's their work, after all -- they are n't the work, themselves. And their pasts, however repellent they are, do n't negate the value in what they create. <p> The controversy over " Birth of a Nation " is n't unique. Many artists, some who 've inspired millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In recent years, Woody Allen has become a pariah over allegations that he sexually abused Mia Farrow 's daughter, Dylan. But no one questions the import of his oeuvre, and his films still open to much fanfare. " Braveheart " -- Parker 's acknowledged favorite film, to which " Birth of a Nation " has drawn comparisons -- won the Oscar for Best Picture. But Mel Gibson, itsstar and director, who informally advised Parker on his project, is known now for his racist and misogynistrants. <p> I 'm currently enjoying the biography of author Patricia Highsmith, a noted anti-Semite, and I simply ca n't be sure a more detestable person ever existed. But I ca n't deny she wrote fabulous psychological thrillers. <p> When I 'm delighting my niece with a reading of Dr. Seuss 's classic, " The Cat in the Hat, " I confess that his racist depictions of African Americans and Japanese Americans could n't be further from my mind. <p> There are exceptions. I used to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grind, " but now I definitely do, because I ca n't listen to it without feeling like he 's alluding to his widely reported sexual liaisons with underage girls. <p> But even my exceptions are arbitrary. Rick James went to prison for tying a woman to a chair and burning her with a crack pipe. But if " Super Freak " comes on at a party? I 'm on the dance floor. And in some cases, I ca n't adequately explain how I ultimately drew the line between moral judgment and aesthetic merit. <p> Neither can society. Two years after former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice was captured on video hitting his wife, no NFL team will sign him. Yet Jim Brown remains an icon, enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame and held up for his activism. This, even though he 's admitted to slapping women around, including being accused and charged, but not convicted, with throwing one woman off the balcony of his home. <p> We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit women. And very few of us took the opportunity to revisit Dr. Dre 's track record when " Straight Outta Compton " was released last year. <p> I can best explain my decision to go see " Birth of a Nation " the way Jewish conductor Daniel Barenboim explains his choice to perform the work of anti-Semite German composer Wilhelm Richard Wagner, in Israel, where it is unofficially banned. " Well, I think it 's obvious, " he says, " that Wagner 's anti-Semitic views and writings are monstrous... Wagner, the person, is absolutely appalling, despicable, and, in a way, very difficult to put together with the music he wrote, which so often has exactly the opposite kind of feelings. It is noble, generous, etc. " He notes that there 's no character in Wagner 's operas equivalent to Shylock, but William Shakespeare is n't held at arms ' length in the same way. <p> Parker is n't Wagner, of course, and if the growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Birth of a Nation " will be " Die Walk? re. " But I want to evaluate and maybe even enjoy it for myself. <p> The Post 's Alyssa Rosenberg wrote in August that when a movie becomes a cause c? l? bre -- as this one did before Parker 's past surfaced -- it became " difficult to discuss as a movie. " That remains true now that conversation about its artistic value has been swamped by controversy, even though we compartmentalize our reactions to the work of everyone from Shakespeare to Seuss without the same kind of tension. <p> No question, we should have a robust discussion about Parker 's past. We have to in a culture that still has not come to a consensus on what constitutes consent, and what does n't. But boycotting this movie feels like a gesture that allows us to feel self-righteous but does n't accomplish much else. It might be a cinematic tour-de-force, or it might be pulp fiction. But there 's only one way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge it based on my feelings about Parker. <p> Comments our editors find particularly useful or relevant are displayed in Top Comments, as are comments by users with these badges :.
