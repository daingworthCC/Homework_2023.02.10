3052441 <p> The jubilant crew of the shuttle Endeavour released the $ 131 million Intelsat communications satellite early today after a historic three-man spacewalk that rescued the marooned spacecraft from the uselessly low orbit in which it was stuck for two years. <p> The astronauts grabbed the satellite by hand in unison Wednesday, held it in place for 1 1/2 hours and spent several hours more attaching a rocket designed to lift it to a working orbit 22,300 miles high. <p> NASA today extended the duration of Endeavour 's record setting inaugural flight. Now targeted at nine days in length, the flight is slated to end on Saturday about 5:30 p.m. with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. As they touchdown a parachute will blossom from the tail of the spacecraft for the first time, a new safety measure with which the space agency is equipping its shuttles. <p> Meanwhile, astronauts Kathy Thornton and Tom Akers prepared for the mission 's fourth spacewalk later today, a six-hour operation in which they planned to test proposed space station assembly procedures and several rescue devices. <p> Late Wednesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, two-handed catch of the satellite, ending the ship 's trouble-plagued pursuit of the wobbly, van-sized spacecraft. <p> " " Houston, I think we got a satellite, " Endeavour commander Dan Brandenstein radioed Mission Control, igniting a chorus of cheering and applause among weary control teams in Houston and Washington. <p> " " We got a whole lot of smiling faces down here, " Mission Control responded through the noise of the brief celebration. <p> The deft space grab by spacewalkers Rick Hieb, Pierre Thuot and Akers occurred moments before 7 p.m., easing but not ending the buildup of suspense which began Sunday night with the first series of frustrating failures by Thuot to wrestle the 4 1/2-ton drum-shaped device under control. <p> Wednesday 's space walk, the 100th since American and Soviet space operations commenced, established a new record for duration before it was over. The three astronauts remained suited for 8 hours and 29 minutes, breeaking a 20-year mark set by the last astronauts to walk on the moon during the Apollo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new mark was established in part because of a momentary failure by a zipper and spring device aboard the shuttle to re-deploy the once marooned communications satellite after the astronauts had equipped it with a new 12-ton rocket motor. <p> The spacecraft was scheduled for re-deployment at 11:40 p.m., but failed to rise as Thornton twice sent electrical commands. <p> However after 13 minutes of intense trouble shooting, the mechanism worked. <p> " " I wonder if any of you down there have ever heard of St. Jude( the patron saint of answered prayers), " signed pilot Kevin Chilton. <p> " " I think right now we 're probably in touch with most of the saints, " ansewered Ken Reightler, the spacecraft communicator in Mission Control. <p> The International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium, or Intelsat, owners of the spacecraft, planned today to send remote commands from their Washington control center that will fire the new rocket motor, propelling the device to its intended high altitude destination. <p> The satellite was stranded in a uselessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of its expendable rocket motor failed. <p> After reaching operational status, the spacecraft will play a role in the relay of televised coverage of July 's Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. <p> Wednesday 's cosmic satellite catch required a stellar effort by the first-ever trio of spacewalking astronauts as well as some unprecedented precision flying by Brandenstein, NASA 's chief astronaut. <p> The odd-looking combination of shuttle, satellite and astronaut were soaring 225 miles over the Pacific Ocean southwest of the Hawaiian Islands at 17,500 miles per hour as they made the nab. <p> For nearly 20 anxious minutes the 4 1/2-ton drum drifted over the ship 's bay as the three astronauts waited for Brandenstein to position them at eye level with the underside of the satellite. <p> " " It 's coming. Just be patient, " he instructed them. " " All we can do is sit here and wait for the right opportunity. " <p> " " I do n't have anything else on my dance card, " quipped Hieb. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuttle 's grasp during frustrating spacewalks Sunday and Monday as Thuot tried to gain control by latching an 18-foot-long metal " " capture bar " to a narrow circular metal ledge concealed within an opening on the spacecraft 's underside. <p> The episode was starting to look more like a rugby match than a satellite rescue. <p> " " Real easy, guys. Really easy, " Brandenstein coached as the spacecraft settled towards them. <p> " " It looks perfect to me, " said Akers, the tension growing. <p> " " Wait, wait, " Hieb instructed before finally barking, " " Let 's do it. " " " Got it! " shouted Thuot. <p> With their quarry firmly in hand, Hieb, Thuot and Akers painstakely turned the spacecraft in a clockwise motion until Hieb, then Thuot could reach beneath the satellite and latch the " " capture bar " with its grapple fixture at one end in place. <p> The bar, which had proven so difficult to paste onto the satellite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool by Thuot an hour and a half after the spacewalking trio 's original nab. <p> Colleague Bruce Melnick, operating the arm from a control panel inside Endeavour, then commanded the robotic fingers at the end of the device to grasp the grapple fixture and lift the once stranted satellite atop the new rocket motor in the ship 's big cargo bay so the operation could continue. <p> For Wednesday 's last ditch attempt, Mission Control abandoned the strategy of using Thuot on the robot arm with the capture bar, a plan it had devised and rehearsed for nearly two years, replacing it with a never attempted approach that required Brandenstein to fly the 100-ton orbiter 's open payload bay toward the satellite so slowly that it literally floated into the fingertips of the three spacewalkers. <p> The exhausting operation was punctuated with tense as well as lighter moments. <p> The shuttle 's final approach, a series of gentle maneuvers that took the ship within easy view of the satellite and initiated the spacewalk, was delayed by 90 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In Mission Control the mood grew tense as the control team debated whether it was safe to proceed with a risky rendezvous that would rely totally on reliable two-way communications so that ground computers could generate accurate commands, which flight controlers could send to Chilton, who then manually punched them into the shuttle 's auto pilot. " " I wish we 'd brought some M &Ms,"; said Thuot. " " You should have thought of that before you buttoned up, " Mission Control responded.
