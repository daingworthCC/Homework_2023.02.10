3044241 <p> The first time I made marshmallows I was 8. Or so the story goes. I think I may have actually been a little older -- perhaps 10 or 11. But when family stories are repeated over and over, as this one has been, they take on a life of their own. <p> I have a few memories of the day in question. I remember it was too cold to go outside, and I did n't feel like watching reruns of " Petticoat Junction, " and what the heck is a marshmallow, anyhow? I went into the kitchen, took out the appropriate volume of the Woman 's Day Encyclopedia of Cookery and looked it up. We had all the ingredients, so I started. <p> I remember my older sister, Ellen, coming into the kitchen and asking me what I was doing. <p> " I 'm making marshmallows. " <p> " You 're making marshmallows? " she asked with the exploding laughter she saved for the most ridiculously funny situations in life. " Only you would make marshmallows. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert, about my project. Peals of laughter came bounding down the stairs, followed by Robert. Ellen got on the light blue Princess telephone next to her bed and immediately called her best friend, Joyce Lukaser, who came over. <p> Everyone wanted to try them. My mom and dad. The neighbors. The teachers at my school. And everyone had the same blank/funny assessment, namely : " It 's a marshmallow. " <p> But this was the thing : I loved marshmallows. Ellen had completely vulgar tastes in candy -- Hostess snowballs and Jordan almonds. I think she liked anything as long as it was pink. Robert was a typical kid. He liked Butterfingers, Devil Dogs and Reese 's Peanut Butter Cups. In short, anything vaguely chocolate. <p> I was a marshmallow epicure. I vastly preferred the Campfire brand over Jet-Puffed. The ultimate treats were the " old fashioned " Campfire marshmallows that came in a kind of cardboard cigar box. Inside were two layers of sharp-edged marshmallows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusty with cornstarch. My mom was dubious, but occasionally acquiesced and bought them for a special treat. <p> At Christmas I always wanted to make stained glass window treats. No, not the kind with melted Lifesavers. The kind with multicolored miniature marshmallows and chocolate formed into logs and then sliced. <p> I have to say, though, that I always hated miniature marshmallows on top of hot chocolate. Hot chocolate must have two large marshmallows. The first one you eat early on, so that it is slippery only on the surface but cool and integral within. The second one you allow to transform. <p> When we roasted marshmallows on a fire, I always made sure to get them perfectly brown on the surface and melted through and through. Robert stuck his right into the flame and carbonized it in an engulfing fireball. He would be on his third while I was still fussing over my first. <p> But I know what you 're wondering. How are homemade marshmallows? Are they worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformed into sweet, white foam? <p> First things first. I think homemade marshmallows are delightful as a novelty. But in all honesty, they are just marshmallows. Truth be told, until recently I had only made marshmallows once since the Nixon administration, and yet I was happy to revisit the project. <p> Can you guess the three main ingredients? If you answered sugar, egg whites and gelatin, you win a lifetime supply of Swiss Miss. Here 's what you do : Cook the sugar to the hard-ball stage, whisk in a huge amount of softened and heated gelatin, and then beat this mixture into stiff egg whites until a marshmallow-like mass forms in your mixing bowl and your family begins to worry for your sanity. I had great success with the recipe from the old Time/Life " Good Cook " series. And being a serious food freak, I added loads of crystallized minced ginger to the goo. Once the mixture set, I cut it and rolled the squares in toasted coconut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll have to try more exotic marshmallows flavored with, say, rosewater or anise or grapefruit peel. I may be onto something. These are n't just marshmallows, they 're gourmet adventures. <p> But what will my kids think? <p> DESSERT : Basic Marshmallows Makes about 5 dozen Preparation time : 1 hour Cooling time : 2 hours 2 large egg whites 2 cups granulated sugar 1 tablespoon light corn syrup 1 2/3 cups water, divided 4 packages unflavored powdered gelatin <p> Confectioners ' sugar, sifted <p> Cornstarch <p> In an electric mixer with a whisk attachment or by hand, beat egg whites until stiff.

Increase the heat and boil until the syrup reaches a temperature of 250 to 266 degrees, the hard-ball stage. <p> In another pan, soften the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Set the pan over simmering water and, whisking constantly, dissolve the gelatin. Add coloring and flavoring, if using. <p> Whisk the dissolved gelatin mixture into the syrup. Whisking continuously, gradually pour this mixture onto the stiffly beaten egg whites. If using an electric mixer, turn the machine on and continue to whisk. If whisking by hand, continue until the marshmallow mixture is a white opaque mass that is thick enough to hold its shape. <p> Lightly oil a pan that is 12-by-8-by-1 1/4 inches and dust the pan with a combination of equal quantities of confectioners ' sugar and cornstarch. <p> Pour the marshmallow mixture into the pan, smooth it flat with a narrow-bladed spatula, and let it set one hour. With a knife, loosen the marshmallow from the edges of the pan. Dust a work surface with confectioners ' sugar and turn the marshmallow onto it.

Add it to the sugar and water and leave it in the pot until the sugar reaches the hard-ball stage ; remove and discard. After you beat the warm gelatin into the sugar syrup, add 3 to 4 tablespoons finely minced crystallized ginger. <p> Prepare marshmallows as directed. As marshmallows set, toast a 12-ounce bag of sweetened flaked coconut in a 325-degree oven until evenly toasted, stirring as necessary to prevent it from burning. When coconut is cool, cut marshmallows and roll them in the coconut, dabbing the sides with a little water if needed to help the coconut adhere.( If you like a lot of coconut, roll the marshmallows when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the marshmallows.
