4129341 Last year, the Rockies ' losing provided an opportunity to experiment. This summer, it provides a platform for cold hard analysis. Rather than use the final weeks of the season as a shrugged shoulders plume to the bottom of the ocean, decisions need to be made on everybody. Manager Walt Weiss understands the importance of a respectable finish. He called a team meeting Friday at Coors Field, the second in as many homestands. The message was simple : Play hard, compete. Everything must be evaluated. Not just the players or the record. It starts at the top. On Aug. 1, the first anniversary passed on the Rockies ' decision to promote Bill Geivett into a director of daily major league operations role. It 's a title that moved his desk into the clubhouse, at home and on the road. Entering Saturday, the Rockies ' record since that move was 80 98. It can be argued that it 's not enough data to abandon the idea of a two headed general manager. But there 's enough to support the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clubhouse. He can still function in his capacity without a daily presence, providing more freedom for Weiss to grow into his role or decide it 's not for him. As for Weiss, he has told me repeatedly that he still enjoys the job, particularly once the game starts. He 's clearly made mistakes in his first year. He 's been late on some bullpen maneuvers and he erred by not intervening in Atlanta to prevent Troy Tulowitzki from getting ejected. But there was always going to be growing pains. Evaluating Weiss with the same rubric as a veteran boss is unfair. The players respect him, listen to him. He 's instilled a toughness that was sorely lacking. Still, these final six weeks are important. If the Rockies roll over and finish with 90 losses, that 's an indictment of both the roster and Weiss ' leadership. Several players told me in April that they expected this team to be a contender. If they believed that then, now would be a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's be honest : The Rockies need more talent. They won 64 games last season. They might win 10 more this year. That 's slight progress, not an indication of a remarkable U turn. As I wrote last week, the Rockies have glaring weaknesses. They need a right handed power hitter. Calling on outfielder Giancarlo Stanton remains a must. If the Marlins offer him a long term deal, and he turns it down, will that change their desire to move him? Outfielder Nelson Cruz, Biogenesis baggage included, ca n't be ruled out, though his defense is beyond suspect. The Rockies need at least two relief pitchers, a late inning arm and a versatile middleman. Right hander Jesse Crain, as said before, should be a priority as a free agent. And the Rockies ' suffocation of their prospects must end. It 's time to get creative in packaging young players. If the team does n't trust infielder Josh Rutledge to be an impact bat, look to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's exposed to Triple A Colorado Springs, package him. Trades are zero sum games. You ca n't worry about what your player will do with another team. That reluctance led the Rockies to hold Ian Stewart way too long. Concern yourself with what you are getting in return. Weiss recently said something on a quiet morning in Pittsburgh that I firmly believe and should drive every decision in the coming months. " Roster spots are valuable. You have to be able to help the team win to keep one. That 's the bottom line, " Weiss said. It really is that simple. Decisions must not be made with patience and an eye toward 2015 and beyond. Tulowitzki and Carlos Gonzalez, players other teams will certainly inquire about this winter, are in their prime. If they are going to be kept and I have said I do n't like trading star commodities for unproven young pitchers give them an opportunity to contend. See this season not for what happened in April, but what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not applause for trying hard. Footnotes. There is no indication the Rockies will move either of their biggest stars. But clubs are going to come after Tulo and CarGo, especially the latter because of his affordable contract.... Rockies closer Rafael Betancourt will draw interest from contenders if he shows he 's healthy and effective over the next few weeks. When a National League player is placed on waivers, the team with the worst record in the NL has first dibs. If a player is claimed, the Rockies can release the contract, work out a trade or pull the player back. Only players acquired be fore Sept. 1 are eligible for the postseason....

The former Rockies outfielder is candid, funny and opinionated. Troy E. Renck : 303 954 1294, trenck@denverpost.com or twitter.com/troyrenck THREE UP1.

Phillies : In a free fall since all star break ; Jonathan Papelbon losing fans whenever he opens his mouth or throws a pitch. Spotlight on... Mike Trout, OF, Angels Background : Trout was available to the Rockies in the 2009 draft. But that was the year when they went bold and paid $3.9 million for California prep pitcher Tyler Matzek. Unfortunately, Matzek has n't developed quickly and just now is showing signs of potential again in Double A, his high number of walks notwithstanding. Trout is the player every team wishes it had drafted. Good as Bryce Harper is, Trout has been more consistent, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in April, so there were whispers of a sophomore slide. But he 's quietly put together one of the best seasons in the American League again. He has a 6.1 WAR( wins above replacement), tied with you know who( Detroit 's Miguel Cabrera, who eclipsed him for the American League MVP award last season). Renck 's take : Trout and Harper. Who you got? That question comes up when asking folks who they 'd rather have to start a franchise. Trout is not the defensive player he was last year. I concede that. And I 'd love for the Angels to put him in one spot and leave him there. That said, he 's so dangerous offensively. He entered Saturday batting.331 and had a.425 on base percentage. The damage is startling : 60 extra base hits through his first 113 games, along with 26 stolen bases in 30 attempts. He has swiped 75 bases in 84 tries over the past two years. Harper brings edge, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prone to slumps, though he could hit 50 homers in a season soon. Trout 's speed and balance are game changers. He 's not a mechanical mess, either. He keeps his hitting simple. " It 's all about getting my( front) foot down on time. When I do that, I see the ball well and do fine, " said Trout, who is batting.394 in the second half, picking up some slack for an underachieving Angels team that is playing without the injured Albert Pujols
