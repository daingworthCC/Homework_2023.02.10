3024541 <p> O Globo, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on war in Iraq : <p> There was no doubt how the war on Iraq would end... It was a war of an almighty military power versus outdated arms and puny defense ability. Difficulties for the United States will be to establish peace in one of the world 's most unstable regions ; to sow democracy in a ground fertile of autocratic regimes ; to eliminate pockets of anti-Americanism in a society that has seen American bombs rain on it as an undeserved flagellation. It will require changing methods... It is time for diplomacy - the time of State Secretary Powell... <p> The best prescription seems to quickly involve the international community. Forget about appointing a temporary administration with Iraqi opposition leaders, or appointing an American viceroy. More sensible would be to entrust this mission to the United Nations, which would organize the first elections in the post-Saddam era. This week, after meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, President Bush said the United Nations will play " a vital role " in the reconstruction of Iraq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beam of hope. <p> The Daily Telegraph, London, war in Iraq : <p> Few politicians refer to our Armed Forces without inserting the soubriquet " magnificent ". So accustomed are we to hearing the word that it is easy to stop thinking about what it actually means. <p> Yesterday( April 6), in Basra, we were reminded. Our soldiers conducted themselves with courage, patience, discipline and, when necessary, appropriately directed violence. They were splendid. <p> The storming of Iraq 's second city will come to be seen as a textbook military operation. A battle to control a town is always loaded in the defenders ' favor. In medieval and early modern times, cities that resisted siege could expect havoc and slaughter when they fell. <p> Even today, armies are sometimes prepared to raze urban areas rather than risk house-to-house combat, Grozny being the most recent example. Yet British troops managed to fight their way to the centre of Basra with miraculously few casualties, either to themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon( April 6), American commentators were hailing the pacification of Basra as a model for what should happen in Baghdad. To have occupied a city of 1.2 million people with negligible casualties to the attacker is extraordinary ; to have done so without incurring the hatred of the inhabitants is little short of providential.... <p> The Guardian, London, war in Iraq : <p>... By handing overall control to the U.N., the U.S. and Britain would take an important step to wards healing the rift with France, Germany and Russia. As Jacques Chirac made plain last night, U.N. primacy is the key to unlocking the Iraq stalemate. <p> Washington 's actual intentions are unfortunately rather different. Nobody disputes that U.S.-British forces will have the main security function in Iraq in the immediate future, although they should give way to a U.N.-mandated, Muslim-led stabilization or peacekeeping force as soon as is practicable. But when it comes to political authority and the powers and composition of an interim Iraqi administration, the U.S. is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for as long as it sees fit and to devolve executive authority only to those Iraqis of whom it ideologically approves. <p> In Northern Ireland yesterday( April 8), George Bush promised that the U.N. would play a " vital role " in all aspects of postwar Iraq 's affairs, including " suggesting " Iraqis who might take part in the transition. He also welcomed the appointment of a U.N. " special adviser " on Iraq, answering to the security council. In this Mr. Bush went further than before and further than his more right wing advisers would wish - but not far enough.... <p> The reality is that the U.N. is still being offered a merely advisory, walk-on role in determining Iraq 's future polity ; that the U.S. is set on having its own way ; and that this Frank Sinatra approach to nation-building may be but a prelude to a cacophony of discord and disharmony. <p> San Jose Mercury News, San Jose, California, on citizenship for immigrant U.S. soldiers killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a patriot. Joseph Menusa, Francisco Martinez, Jose Gutierrez, Jesus Suarez del Solar and Jose Garibay died showing that. <p> The five Californians, all immigrants, were among the first U.S. casualties in Iraq. Congress has decreed that they and other non-citizens pose too much of a security risk to inspect bags at airports. Yet they willingly sacrificed their lives for their new country. Immigrants have done this in every war since the Revolution.... <p> Eliminating delays to citizenship is the least the government can do for those in uniform.... <p> Immigrants sign up for the same reasons as other Americans : career opportunities, educational benefits, adventure, devotion to country. <p> Last July, President Bush cited the war on terror when he added a big inducement to enlistment. He ordered that citizenship applications of those on active duty be pushed to the top of the pile.... <p> It should n't take death, though, to get the government 's attention. Citizenship should be enjoyed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on nation-building in postwar Iraq : <p> U.S. troops have n't exactly nailed down Baghdad yet, but they are moving through the streets at will and using the rest room at Saddam 's personal palace. <p> Armed resistance remains a problem, but the allies appear to be gaining control. <p> Within days civilian refugees who fled this city of 5 million will start trickling back in. In their midst will be Iraqi military types whose clandestine presence could cause real problems. Law enforcement will have broken down and the delivery of basic civil services will be sporadic at best. <p> An uncounted mass of displaced humanity will require food, water, medicine, communications and electric power. In the absence of any viable government structure, it will be up to the United States and its military to keep things going in Baghdad. <p> This will not be an easy task, considering the fact that the war is still going on throughout the country.... <p> For at least six months the U.S. military is going to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantee public services and public safety. It is going to have to separate the " sheep from the goats " - war criminals and Saddam brass gone underground - and bring them to a rough justice. <p> It will have to strengthen its victory, disarm the partisans and maintain its own huge presence - all the while walking the fine line between invader and liberator : smile at civilians, do not shout or point weapons, play soccer but watch your back.... <p> Make Baghdad safe, secure and livable and then start talking the fine points of nation building. <p> Daytona Beach News-Journal, Daytona Beach, Florida, on the elusiveness of victory in Iraq : <p> It was n't easy to discern the Bush administration 's case for war in Iraq. In the run-up to the war, the administration alternated between arguments for pre-empting Iraq from using weapons of mass destruction, severing Iraq 's connection to al-Qaida, " liberating " Iraq from tyranny or using it as the first stop on a " roadmap for peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear. So it is n't surprising that defining victory may be just as elusive. Anticipating the fog ahead, the administration is taking steps to embed the word victory with new meaning.... <p> It is looking increasingly as if the war may be drawing to an end, and the occupation is beginning in earnest. But what happened in Afghanistan may happen again in Iraq. The most wanted man in the operation, along with his top entourage, may escape capture. Saddam Hussein 's fate is unknown ; so is his whereabouts, thus opening the possibility of another bin Laden syndrome - a diminished yet symbolically powerful reminder to his followers that there 's still a battle worth fighting.... <p> History has not been kind to Western powers bringing grand plans and ideals to the Middle East. But Bush has a history of declaring premature victory without, as yet, finding himself on the losing side. He did so in the 2000 election, before all the ballots were counted. He did so in Afghanistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over. He may be readying to do so in Iraq. <p> With luck, Bush 's victory streak will hold again, as lives depend on it. But the prospect of an unquiet peace resting on the shoulders of two U.S. Army divisions makes any declaration of victory sound dubious at best if Iraqis are not enthusiastically and overwhelmingly the ones declaring victory. <p> Albuquerque Journal, Albuquerque, New Mexico, on an Iraqi citizen who helped POW Lynch : <p> Even before Desert Storm I, Saddam Hussein 's ruthlessness and his regime 's totalitarian control were well known. <p> Since the current war started, reports of loyalists using human shields, forcing irregular troops to fight coalition forces or be killed by their countrymen and similar tactics have added to the revulsion. Rightfully or not, the tyrant 's persona overshadows the people he rules. <p> Earlier this week, a different kind of Iraqi, a Nasiriyah lawyer whose real name we may never know, overshadowed Saddam. <p> Known only as Mohammed, he is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaten U.S. soldier being slapped by her captor as she lay in a hospital bed. He is the man who, after sending his wife and 6-year-old daughter to the safety of his father 's home, walked six miles through a war zone to find the only people who might be able to save the soldier. <p> Mohammed - knowing full well the risks and consequences of what he was doing - approached his " enemy " with hands held up in surrender. He not only told the Marines where their comrade was, he went back to the hospital to draw maps and note where Saddam loyalists were stationed. <p> Not long afterward, Pfc. Jessica Lynch was rescued in a daring raid on the hospital by special operations forces - and with no coalition casualties. <p> The rescuers were also able to recover several bodies believed to be those of U.S. soldiers. <p> Pfc. Lynch, and most likely some of her rescuers, owe Mohammed their lives. <p> We owe Mohammed our thanks, not only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Iraq is more than Saddam and his henchmen. <p> Iraq is also Mohammed. <p> The Blade, Toledo, Ohio, on warning Syria and Iran to stay out of war : <p> Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell have publicly warned Syria and Iran, both of which have borders with Iraq, to stay out of the war. <p> Syria was warned to stop selling military equipment to Iraq. Iran was warned not to send forces across its 900-mile border with Iraq. <p> Both the actions that prompted the warnings and the countries that were warned represent sensitive issues in themselves, which makes one ask why the threats were n't delivered privately, through diplomatic channels, rather than in public pronouncements. <p> The bottom line is that the war in Iraq has serious potential for expanding beyond the borders of that country to become a regional conflict. That is a problem, and Rumsfeld 's and Powell 's public warnings to Syria and Iran do not make the situation in the region easier @
