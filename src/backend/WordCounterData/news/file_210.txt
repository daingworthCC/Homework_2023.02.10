3040741 <p> As Dean Butler likes to tell it, when he joined Hebron Baptist Church in 1961 with his wife and five children, they boosted weekly attendance by 10 percent. <p> Today, the little white frame church off Dacula Road is gone, replaced by a 1,300-seat auditorium. A Church Life building is under construction and there are plans to replace the auditorium, which was built three years ago. <p> In 15 years, the smallest of the dozen small Baptist churches in and around Dacula has grown to nearly 3,000 regular worshipers. <p> Mr. Butler, 67, who used to put GM cars together in Doraville, admits he misses the small church " in a way. " But, he says, " ai n't no way I 'd go back to it. " <p> Hebron 's is a classic story of church growth on the metro Atlanta frontier. In the 1980s, when Gwinnett was the fastest growing county in America, Hebron caught the wave perfectly. <p> But in doing so, it powerfully affected the spiritual infrastructure of its community. These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hebron. <p> Growth became top priority <p> Ten years ago, Nelson DeBrosse 's 14-year-old daughter was killed in an auto accident. The first person to show up at the hospital was Hebron 's pastor, the Rev. Larry Wynn, who had begun going out on rounds with the Dacula Fire Department. <p> " I believe God put him there for a reason, " said Mr. DeBrosse, who was raised Roman Catholic but had not attended church since moving to Gwinnett from Ohio five years before. " It was that love that we found in him that led us to Christ. " <p> And it led them to become members of Hebron. <p> Growth became Hebron 's top priority within months of the arrival of the Rev. Wynn, then a 24-year-old graduate of Mercer University in Atlanta, in 1977. <p> " The feeling from the beginning was that the purpose of this church was to reach out to as many people as we could, " said the Rev. Wynn, who last fall was elected president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very comfortable to grow up in a church where you knew everyone. But then you read the Bible, and it was n't what the Bible said. " <p> Along with aggressive evangelism, the church gradually expanded its style of worship from traditional hymn-singing to include the rock- influenced music of contemporary Christian gospel. It also initiated counseling ministries, support groups and " life skills " seminars. <p> " Our parents did n't have the influence of TV, " said Judy Gordon, a 20-year member of Hebron who serves as the church 's financial officer. Baby boomers wo n't be satisfied, she said, " unless your church really offers something that will compete with what the world offers them. " <p> Youth outreach is strong <p> Critical to Hebron 's success has been its outreach to youth. <p> " We want to be part of the community, " said the Rev. Wynn, whose wife teaches at Dacula Middle School. " If you 're only a community within yourself, I do n't think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go out into the world. " <p> Lisa Knutson, whose family attends Dacula 's small United Methodist Church, has run into Hebron 's performance of that commission. <p> Last year, her older daughter brought home from the middle school a pamphlet Hebron friends had given her that claimed a person could not be saved unless baptized by complete immersion. It took a long family discussion to convince her that that was not necessarily the case, Ms. Knutson said. <p> " We would not want anyone in our church to be offensive, " said the Rev. Wynn, whose own manner is boyish and friendly. " But I 'd rather kids be fired up about their church than a lot of things they could be talking about. " <p> Derek Spain, 21, a valedictorian and football star when he was at Dacula High, was recently hired to run Hebron 's 200-member high-school youth ministry. He likes to hang out at school and have lunch with the students. <p> " I live their lives with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go down there to ' P.R. ' our church, but to be a regular person. " <p> Hebron 's influence is clear to Steve Parr, who directs the church 's youth ministries. <p> " There 's not a school in the county with a stronger moral base than Dacula High School, " he said. " We 've had a part in it. " <p> Not all the local clergy are so enthusiastic, however. <p> " You 're talking about community control, " said the Rev. R. Page Fulgham of First Baptist Church in nearby Lawrenceville. " This thing is almost like two-thirds of the football team go to Hebron. And yes, they do pray in the schools. They sort of saturated the whole culture. Which is a way to win. " <p> ' A feeder church for Hebron ' <p> Hebron 's evangelism has likewise affected neighboring churches, First Baptist Lawrenceville among them. <p> The Rev. Fulgham, who professes admiration for the Rev. Wynn, reckons that a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I joke about it that our church is a feeder church for Hebron, " he said. But, he admits, " they 're reaching people we would n't reach. " <p> Five years ago, Mark Chandler, pastor of First Baptist Dacula, set up a youth program. Within three years, all the participants had drifted away to Hebron. <p> But the Rev. Chandler takes comfort in the fact that his 125-member independent Baptist church offers an intimacy that Hebron ca n't match. <p> " If they need me in the middle of the night, I 'm there, " he said. <p> Ironically, in the small churches, intimacy can breed divisions - over theology, style of worship or generational control. Steve Ferguson, pastor at nearby Ebenezer Baptist, recognizes, with some frustration, that Hebron offers a haven from these kinds of divisions. <p> " Some of those people were very involved in their church activities, " he said. " Then something happens and they get offended and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you do n't get involved, where you can stay on the fringe. " <p> At Hebron, they try to minimize the anonymity that goes with size. Every Wednesday night, its members meet in 120 Bible study groups, which foster not only learning but " bonding " as well. Members say that Hebron retains a " small church feeling. " <p> No intention of slowing down <p> But for many suburbanites of the baby-boom generation, that feeling may not be so important. <p> " A lot of people do n't want to be hugged, " said Lyle E. Schuller, author of " The Seven-Day-a-Week Church, " a 1992 book on modern American megachurches. <p> " I think we are living in a world that has taught people to be comfortable in a world of big institutions. " <p> Hebron, whose annual budget is now $ 1.9 million, aims to have 3,400 regular worshipers by the end of 1994, and has no intention of stopping there. <p> Indeed, the new subdivisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of school rezoning two years ago, the proportion of Hebron children in the Dacula schools has dropped from one- half to one-third, church officials estimate. <p> And the newcomers have begun to resist Hebron 's religious hegemony. <p> Every May, the Dacula recreation board would suspend its Spring softball season during Hebron 's annual Starlight Crusade revival. <p> Last year, however, some new board members objected to the practice and a compromise had to be worked out. Softball would continue through crusade week, but any team that could not field enough players would be permitted to reschedule rather than forfeit a game. <p> " I was glad to see that, " said Lisa Knutson. " Softball was not closed down for any other church. "
