3066241 <p> The thrill of fighting heavyweight, high-speed fish often is thought to be beyond the average angler 's reach. But now through summer, some of the Gulf 's hardest-hitting predators are closer than many anglers realize. <p> Rising water temperatures pull maturing baitfish and shrimp from the bays and flush them, with each falling tide, into the open Gulf. In their wake, within easy reach of small boats and often within casting distance of coastal piers, comes a host of classic sportfish. <p> The primary hunting ground of these fish is an area known by experienced fishermen as the " nearshore zone " and by newcomers, all too often, as " water we ignore on the way offshore. " <p> It is within those first couple of miles off the beach that the Gulf 's sharpshooters have the greatest advantage over their prey. That applies to fish and to fishermen. <p> In deep water, more than 30 feet, baitfish can swim left, right, up or down to elude prey. The shallower they go, the less chance they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer than 10 feet of water, on the average spring day at this end of the Texas coast, seasonal turbidity shrouds prey in a sandy cloak. <p> Between those extremes, in roughly 10-30 feet of water, is where small fish are most vulnerable to attack. <p> " The jacks showed up last week, and we 've been getting a lot of them, " said Sonya Strasburg of the Galveston Fishing Pier around noon this past Friday. " We 've already had two bull reds today, too. " <p> Jack crevalle are highly aggressive predators. Their tall, slender bodies are packed with ruby-red muscle and driven by a sickle-shaped tail. Spawning-sized bull reds that prowl the nearshore zone are bulkier and more colorful, not so fast as a jack but every bit as bold and determined. <p> Incoming pier fishermen typically learn how and where to target spring 's monsters before they learn when to do so, but answering all three questions correctly is critical to consistent success. Because they can only walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, shore-bound anglers must pay strict attention to conditions. <p> The " how " and " where " are simple : heavy tackle slinging big, fresh baits in nearshore water. It really is that elementary. <p> Optimally, the " when " involves a coming together of three key factors. <p> A southeast breeze coaxes clearer water toward shore, whereas sideshore gusts tend only to generate waves and disturb the sandy bottom. Ideally, the pier angler intent on hooking a major-league fish should watch for days that combine light onshore air flow with four daily tides. The double exchange improves odds of pulling " green " water into casting range. <p> Temperature also is important. <p> " As soon as that water temperature hits 72 degrees, " Strasburg said, " it goes nuts here. " <p> Align those three stars this month - wind, tide and temperature - and you could hook a truly great fish. <p> " Ling show up around the first of April every year, " she said. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pier, all around 30 pounds. " <p> Guide James Trimble said that on rare April days when he 's not escorting trout fishermen, he 'll ease beyond the jetties to check for ling and other big fish around nearshore structures. <p> " First thing we do is check some of the cans( buoys) and nearshore rigs for ling, kings, stuff like that. As water heats up and the Sargassum weed shows, that 's another signal. When you see that stuff up and down the beach, there 's no telling what you might catch out there. " <p> Sargassum weed, which originates in huge, floating masses in the Sargasso Sea, carries an abundance of thimble-sized marine life. Those tiny shrimp, crabs and other creatures feed a variety of mid-sized fish that, in turn, sustain bigger predators. <p> The same conditions that attract ling also draw king mackerel toward shore, and the earliest fish in the spring/summer parade often are among the largest. <p> More commonly caught from boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles of the beach routinely weigh 20-plus pounds. They grow three times as large, but a 20-pound king packs all the power a sportsman could ask. <p> Watch weed lines also, Trimble said, for tripletail, among the tastiest fish in the Gulf. Early, while the Sargassum is most " alive, " triple tail are plentiful and can be caught on shrimp or jigs, or on fly rods using shrimp or crab patterns. <p> Boats can be advantages or disadvantages this time of year, depending on wind. Against standard spring blows, the stability and solid footing of a pier is a blessing. Bobby Miller of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department advised boaters to check marine forecasts carefully and realize that even if the surf is blown flat, such as what happens on the north wind of a late front, water any real distance off the beach can be a roiled, potentially dangerous mess. <p> Catch a rare spring day when flags fall softly against their poles, and a ride through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less fuel. <p> Either way, with patience, spring fishermen get their shots at some of the Gulf 's biggest, hottest fish. <p>... <p> PREPARING FOR BIG HAUL <p> Standard setup for pier fishermen is the heavy-duty equivalent of a bass angler 's Carolina rig. <p> Add a small snap swivel( off which hangs a surf sinker) to the fishing line and a plastic bead beneath the swivel. <p> To the end of the line, tie a barrel swivel. <p> Beyond it, add 24-36 inches of 40- to 60-pound fluorocarbon leader( with a short length of light wire for king mackerel). <p> Most fishermen finish the rig with a 12/0-15/0 circle hook, which sets itself as the fish swims away with the bait. <p> Traditional J-style hooks still work but can be difficult to set at the end of a long cast. <p> " Bring plenty of fresh bait, " advised Bobby Miller with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. " Catch your own if you can. Throw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I 'd try dropping a Sabiki rig, carefully, around the jetties on the way out. " <p> For jacks and bull reds, chunks of cut mullet or menhaden work well. <p> To improve the odds of catching those big fish or a king or ling, try a live mullet either on bottom or suspended beneath a float. " Ling love hardheads, " said Sonya Strasburg from the Galveston Fishing Pier. Finally, a use for hardheads. <p> NOTES : doug.pike@chron.com 1. BEN DESOTO : CHRONICLE, 2. DOUG PIKE : CHRONICLE
