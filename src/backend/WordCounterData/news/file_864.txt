5024841 <h> NORFOLK <p> If you ask The HandleBards, cycling actors from the United Kingdom, it 's always best to bike. <p> The four-man troupe made its U.S. debut Wednesday afternoon on the Blue Moon Stage at Waterside, performing an interactive rendition of William Shakespeare 's A Midsummer Night 's Dream. <p> More than 40 people showed up to watch, cheering as the actors played two and sometimes three characters apiece. <p> The performance was organized by The Virginia Arts Festival and other local organizations to celebrate National Bike Month. One of the bikes -- made by Pedego Electric Bikes -- was used to draw the curtain as one actor pedaled. <p> Started about six years ago, the troupe bicycles everywhere, said members Calum McIntosh and Matthew Seager. They said the founding members wanted to go on an adventure after graduating from college, so they hopped on bikes and cycled through the UK performing Shakespeare at all sorts of venues. <p> " Then what started as an adventure and a fun summer turned into another one, " McIntosh said. <p> They 've performed around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, India and Asia. <p> Between the two of them, McIntosh and Seager played more than four characters during Wednesday 's show, including Demetrius, Titania, Helena and Nick Bottom. They also recruited audience members to play minor roles. <p> At one point, Hermia screeched after Lysander proposed to her, running off to high five a woman watching the show. Later, one of Seager 's characters ran off screeching in fear toward the Blue Moon Taphouse 's outdoor dining area, only to return with a beer in hand as the crowd roared in laughter. <p> " There 's only four of us, so we might need some help from( the audience) to tell the story, " he said. <p> They are n't the only troupe in the HandleBards, which has about 30 actors and actresses including a women-only troupe. Their performances are always different and in new locations like schools and parks. <p> " It can go anywhere, basically, which is what we like, " McIntosh said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone. " <p> Seager said they 've gotten used to biking everywhere. They only ride in cars when it 's absolutely necessary, like when someone 's injured. <p> " When we cycled the show for the first time four years ago, it was really tough, " he said. " We 've got these big trailers attached to the back with all our set props and costumes. Then we got to about five, six weeks in where your legs are climatized to it. " <p> Melissa Williams, 37, went to the show with her three children. Her 14-year-old son, Grayson Blayer, is no stranger to the theater. He used to act with The Hurrah Players. <p> They both loved the show. <p> " It was just funny, " she said. " I know it 's a comedy but they were just really silly with it and it being all men like Shakespeare did it made it better. " <p> The next stop is 6:30 p.m. Friday at The Plot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Olney Road. The Handlebards will also hit Virginia Beach, Portsmouth and Williamsburg over the next few days. <p> All shows are free and open to the public.
