3057541 <p> Depending which way you turn your head at the Ensemble/HCC stop on Metro 's light rail line, it appears great things are starting to happen - or the area is going nowhere. <p> In one direction, stylish shops and eateries are popping up. There 's the cosmopolitan Julia 's Bistro with its violet and mango interior and glass windows overlooking the train. Tacos A-Go-Go, a hip taqueria sporting a statue of Carmen Miranda, will open in several months. <p> But look in another direction, and the neighborhood seems full of empty lots, boarded-up buildings and panhandlers. <p> Both optimists and pessimists can make their case about how the 1-year-old light rail will shape development along the route. <p> Some believe the rail will generate something new for Houston : dense " urban villages " where people live, work and play. And some do n't. <p> Since the Main Street light rail opened, no major development has sprung up along its seven-mile corridor. Experts advise that patience is required ; it takes five years or more for such growth. <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a challenge : Unlike in many other cities with rail lines, no rules here encourage urban environments combining residential, office and retail space. <p> Developing in time <p> In the late 1990s, when city and Metro leaders were trying to sell Houstonians on a light rail line along Main, they emphasized the economic benefits of new development. <p> Today, a year after the rail line opened, the adjoining landscape looks much as it did before the line was built. <p> " It 's incredibly disappointing that nothing has happened on Main Street of significance, " said David Crossley, president of the Gulf Coast Institute, a nonprofit group promoting quality-of-life issues. <p> Metro Chairman David Wolff counsels patience : " I 'm not at all disappointed. These things take years. " <p> Michael Bayard, a senior research fellow at the Urban Land Institute, agreed. In Washington, D.C., he said, it 's taken from five to 28 years for development to take off around subway transit stops. <p> " Development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area, " said developer Rob Dickson, owner of Albuquerque-based Paradigm &; Co. " You 're talking about dozens, if not hundreds, of property owners. " <p> He noted that development along new roadways does not happen overnight, either. <p> Some say the transit line has already enhanced Main Street. <p> " What the light rail does is give Main Street energy for everybody on it, " said John Zotos, owner of St. Pete 's Dancing Marlin restaurant downtown. " The street is never dead, " he said, and the train is " sleek and beautiful. " <p> Light rail has done more for economic development than people realize, said Ed Wulfe, chairman of the Main Street Coalition. Considerable development downtown took place before the trains began running, in anticipation of them, including downtown lofts, restaurants and building redevelopments. <p> Wulfe said buses are making 1,200 fewer trips up and down Main daily, making the corridor better for retailers who prefer that their window-shoppers not inhale bus fumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen, but it should n't be oversold, said Joel Kotkin, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation. <p> In Los Angeles, where Kotkin lives, development along transit lines has been very slow, he said. <p> Real estate insiders in Houston say there has been a rush of land speculation on Main by investors seeking windfall profits when vacant land near rail becomes scarce. <p> Some big projects sit on the drawing board, including Shamrock Tower, a 32-story condo project at Main and Texas, planned by developer Tracy Suttles. Interest is high, the company says, but no date is set for groundbreaking. <p> One proposed Midtown project could have been a model for urban development : Morris Architects planned an energy-efficient new building combining offices, apartments and retail, but because of high construction costs and depressed office rents, the firm is now considering existing buildings on or near light rail, said Morris architect Doug Childers. <p> Urban, pedestrian-friendly development goes completely against the Houston grain, Childers noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dickson, to consider its options. <p> Metro recently hired real estate executive Todd Mason to negotiate deals with developers for projects on land Metro owns. The developers could lease property from Metro or enter into joint ventures. <p> Metro owns 6.7 acres around the Wheeler-Blodgett station in Midtown, a site appropriate for a transit-oriented development, Mason said, and Metro 's 4.5-acre transit center on Fannin south of Holcombe is designed to accommodate high-rise development. <p> Peter Brown, an architect and urban planner, said few new projects have been built along the rail line because developers see Houston as a gamble. Cities such as Denver and Dallas created redevelopment authorities to guide development along urban transportation systems. <p> Houston planning officials will again seek approval for an " area plan " ordinance empowering management districts to craft land-use guidelines. Guy Hagstette, special assistant to the mayor for urban design, said officials do n't know how much area the plan will cover, but it would include the Main Street corridor. <p> The size of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that smacks of zoning. <p> Small-business owners along the rail line have wildly different opinions of light rail. For Zotos, the opening of light rail signaled the end of a nightmare : " We went through so much hell with construction, " he said. And he estimates his business has increased 15 percent from rail passengers arriving from south of downtown, particularly the Medical Center, during the lunch hour. <p> However, Mantra on Main stopped its lunch service partly because rail was n't bringing as much business as anticipated. <p> Randy Burris, owner of a Midtown wheelchair business, Scooter Express, said his business has suffered since the advent of rail. " I had two big beautiful driveways, and handicapped people could roll in and out, " he said. For a while he put up protest banners. <p> What kind of change? <p> Sooner or later, change will come to the seven-mile light rail corridor. The question is : What kind? <p> Adam Brackman, a self-described urban broker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, edgy retailers who " embrace the street and help create a sense of place. " <p> Last year, he helped start an urban brokerage team at Wulfe &; Co. focused on marketing the light rail line and finding retailers and developers who understand urban development. <p> Last week, he brought in Tacee Webb of American Apparel, a Los Angeles-based, youth-oriented clothier with 26 stores. <p> Webb, locations manager of American Apparel, said she is very interested in a downtown building on Main Street as her first Houston location. Her company wants to be part of downtown revitalizations, she said, to " maintain our street credibility. " <p> Kerry Inman 's idea to move her art gallery near the Ensemble/HCC stop came spontaneously : While riding the brand-new Metro train last year, she saw a " For Lease " sign on the 1929 Isabella Court building. <p> She knew it would be a risk because there are hardly any other galleries nearby. But she is optimistic that the neighborhood will become a fun mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the hip-enough-for-SoHo T'afia, which on Saturdays hosts a crafts and farmers market. <p> Inman had heard that a big medical building is slated to go up across the street from her gallery, and she worried that it might not be " in the spirit of what we 're trying to do. " <p> But when told that plans call for a Midtown Medical Hospital that 's pedestrian-friendly with a mini-park and fountain, a 24-hour public parking garage, and restaurants, Inman was pleased. <p> The original plans for the medical complex called for a partially gated, **26;2366;TOOLONG facility, but the broker, Adam Brackman, convinced the sellers to stipulate in writing that the development would be more open to the public and its surroundings, and the buyer, Jim Rutherford, agreed. <p> Brackman acknowledged, however, that the odds of getting buyers and sellers to voluntarily agree to such guidelines at any other spot along the rail are fairly slim. <p> NOTES : Chronicle reporters Mike Snyder and Dai Huynh contributed to this story @ @ @
