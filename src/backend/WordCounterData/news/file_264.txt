3047541 <p> Emergencies -- war, fire, flood -- have always brought Americans running to each other 's aid, but the chronic ills of recent years have ignited a quiet revolution : Every day a nation of volunteers goes to work. <p> Driven in large part by a simple desire to help others, a virtual army of Good Samaritans is rising to fight relentless problems such as government cutbacks, overburdened social agencies and high unemployment. <p> In 1991 alone, more than half of all Americans volunteered some of their free time -- unpaid labor with a dollar value equal to half the national deficit. <p> " I am busy, but I think it 's the responsibility of every active person in society to help out, " said Voncille Smith, a San Francisco bank officer who teaches low-income adolescent girls how to look for work and manage money. " Do we expect the Martians to come down from Mars and do it? If we do n't do it ourselves, who will? " <p> Whether they are working as reserve police officers, unpaid school tutors or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and providing a reinvigorated sense of community. Millions of ordinary people are shattering the image of a nation of self-absorbed, apathetic couch potatoes by devoting their time and energy to causes and projects that matter to them. <p> Consider these figures from a 1992 study of giving and volunteering in the United States by Independent Sector, the nation 's foremost authority on volunteer statistics : <p> * In 1991, 94.2 million adults volunteered 20.5 billion hours. Not one of them collected a pay- check for this time, which is valued at $ 176 billion. <p> * Counting volunteers and 8.6 million paid workers, the independent sector -- which includes nonprofit organizations and arts, cultural and religious groups -- is America 's single largest employer, outranking government( 22 million workers) and industry( 97.1 million workers). <p> * Nationwide, the average volunteer gives 4.2 hours a week. Locally, people are even more generous : Bay Area volunteers donate an average of 6 hours of service a week. <p> Although volunteering is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of services than ever before. Today 's volunteer movement differs from such 1960s programs as the Peace Corps -- which involved a narrower segment of the population -- and from the national response to such emergencies as World Wars I and II. <p> " Americans -- even from pre- Revolutionary times -- have always responded to emergencies. That 's different from the enormous depth and strength of the day-to-day effort we 're seeing now, " said Virginia Hodgkinson, director of research for Independent Sector. <p> According to biennial Gallup polls commissioned by Independent Sector, the number of volunteer hours has been rising since the late 1980s. <p> Researchers say that before 1985, no broad, accurate studies of volunteerism are available. Nevertheless, the changing nature and scope of volunteerism is apparent in the recent growth of corporate volunteer programs, rising government support for volunteerism and widespread classroom volunteer projects. <p> Experts say social and political changes in the 1980s may have contributed to this surge in public service. <p> Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on government services, Americans should help each other. Republicans saw volunteering as a means of compensating for the big cuts they undertook in domestic spending. <p> Bush backed his call for " a thousand points of light " by pushing through Congress the National and Community Service Act of 1990, which provided $ 287 million for community service programs. <p> Young professionals who felt guilty about the time they spent acquiring material goods began to want to give something back to their communities. <p> Finally, state and local budget cuts forced nonprofit agencies to rely more heavily on volunteers to meet the growing need for social services. <p> Although Bush and President Clinton 's national service initiatives generated much attention, specialists in the nonprofit field argue that both administrations ' public service policies tapped into an existing spirit in the country. <p> The will to serve cuts across lines of gender, race, age and income. A 1991 study by Bay Area Strive for Five, the local wing of a national initiative to promote volunteering, found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most likely to volunteer. <p> Men and women volunteer just about equally. And at least one-third of all blacks, whites, Asians and Latinos donate their time. <p> No single group has cornered the market on caring ; nevertheless, many people would never call it " volunteering " -- they might say they are just " helping out. " Joining neighbors to make sandwiches for a shelter or speaking on a panel for no pay, researchers estimate, make up about a third of all volunteer efforts. <p> Part of the reason people might not think of the help they give as volunteering is because of their image of who volunteers, said Nora Silver, director of the Volunteerism Project, a Bay Area research organization. <p> " I wish we could throw out the term ' volunteer ' altogether, " Silver said. " I think for a lot of people, it has negative connotations. " <p> Silver said that when many people hear the word " volunteer, " they think of a stereotype : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband and children are away during the day. Although such women formed the backbone of volunteerism for generations, that image is outdated. For one thing, most volunteers now work outside the home. Locally, 59 percent of volunteers have full-time jobs and an additional 14 percent work part time. Only 5 percent are homemakers. <p> Volunteers alone have not filled the void left by reductions in government programs. <p> " A lot of Republicans argued for volunteerism as a substitute for cuts in social services -- which is totally inadequate, " said Pablo Eisenberg, director of the Center for Community Change, a national nonprofit policy organization. " Volunteerism is no substitute for money. " <p> Nonetheless, volunteers are the invisible stitches that bond communities and hold a society together. Some of the ways they are taking the initiative : <p> * Museum docents, library clerks, tree planters and neighborhood watch captains contributed almost $ 6 million worth of work to the city of Oakland last year, said Gerald Leo, director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the foot soldiers of the war on AIDS, said Eileen Blumenthal, director of volunteer services for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. From the advisers answering 9,000 calls a month for the foundation 's hotline to the drivers delivering hundreds of Project Open Hand meals weekly, volunteers play crucial roles in education, advocacy and care giving for people with HIV. <p> * About a third of the 3,441 volunteers who put in 380,000 hours tutoring kindergarten through 12th- graders in San Francisco last year did not have children enrolled in city schools, said Sandra Treacy, executive director of San Francisco School Volunteers. <p> Today 's volunteers are software engineers who cap 10-hour work days by tutoring children in math. People living in shelters stock shelves at food banks. Immigrants serve as mental health counselors for newer arrivals in their neighborhoods. Middle school students help elderly people with art therapy projects. And pilots give free air transportation to medical patients. <p> Volunteer coordinators insist that the role of the volunteer is not to take away a salaried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases, unions and official hiring policies prohibit an unpaid worker taking a job. <p> Many people who already work full time say they achieve fulfillment from volunteering that eludes them on the job. <p> Ken Hempel gets a paycheck for crunching numbers for the Internal Revenue Service but he says he can not calculate the value of the reward he gets from working as a medix, the name the Berkeley Free Clinic gives volunteers trained in simple medical care. <p> " My job is institutionalized, in- house budget-tracking for the IRS -- straitlaced, 9-to-5 work, " Hempel said. " The Free Clinic is a far cry from that. My work at the clinic calls upon my basic humanity, a willingness to listen and to be nonjudgmental. " <p> Medical studies have indicated that volunteering not only makes people feel better but may help them live longer. University of Michigan researchers studied 2,700 people for 10 years and found that regular volunteer work had a greater positive effect on life expectancy than any other activity. <p> Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " helper 's high, " similar to the endorphin rush runners enjoy. Volunteers reported many pleasant physical effects -- calmness, energy and greater self-esteem. Lowered blood pressure and improved immune systems have both been linked to altruistic acts. <p> Donating money and volunteer projects that do not bring people into direct contact with others do not bring about the same psychological and physiological boosts as person- to-person caring, said researcher Allan Luks, the author of " The Healing Power of Doing Good. " He said that these studies indicate nurturing others satisfies some physiological need. <p> Many volunteers say they are moved to help because they want to do something for their communities, but what keeps them volunteering is how good they feel about connecting with someone else. <p> Zenzi Cook is a beauty school director who shows cancer patients how to camouflage the ravages of chemotherapy with wigs and makeup. Some of the women she advises have lost all their hair -- including their eyebrows and eyelashes. <p> " If you do n't have eyebrows, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cook said. Four years ago she became involved with " Look Good... Feel Better, " a national organization that trains volunteer beauty professionals to help cancer patients improve their looks and attitudes. She said she never imagined that teaching someone how to use an eyebrow pencil would make her feel so good. <p> " I ca n't tell you what a self-fulfilling program it is, " she said. " We get so much more than we give.
