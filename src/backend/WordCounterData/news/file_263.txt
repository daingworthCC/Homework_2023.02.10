3047441 <p> On a hot day last week, hundreds of doctors and patients jammed a San Francisco City Hall hearing room to complain that further cuts to health clinics would threaten lives. <p> The following day, more than 200 young children and adults rallied on the steps of City Hall to complain that cuts to libraries would threaten the literacy of an entire generation. <p> On the surface, nothing seemed incompatible about the two causes. But hidden tension between the groups was bluntly stated by a health care advocate who wandered through the crowd of sign-carrying library boosters. <p> " Dead people ca n't read books, " she muttered. <p> The fierce competition between libraries and health clinics, police programs and swimming pools, workers ' salaries and business taxes, has become an annual civic event. This year, with the city facing the largest deficit in its history, it will be even worse. <p> Years of expanding programs, growing payrolls, cuts in aid and lagging revenues will force San Francisco to make financial choices more painful than ever before. While cities across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a city and county -- faces a particularly acute problem because of wide demands on its services. <p> This week, Mayor Frank Jordan will complete his budget in the midst of the city 's worst financial crisis, a balancing act that he calls the toughest challenge of his public career. <p> " It will be balanced with pain, " said Teresa Serata, the mayor 's budget director, who describes herself as the " most hated woman in City Hall. " <p> " Everyone will feel the pain, " she said. <p> Solutions likely to be proposed include : <p> * Layoffs and other wage concessions. The Jordan team is planning to eliminate the jobs of more than 1,000 workers, including hundreds of middle managers whom they believe contribute to a bloated bureaucracy. In addition, they will recommend the wholesale demotion of many workers in order to knock them into lower pay categories. The average salary of lawyers in the city attorney 's and district attorney 's offices, for example, could drop by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close the adult portions of all 20 branch libraries, reduce hours at swimming pools and trim hospital space and rooms for the homeless. <p> * Taxes and fees. Jordan is planning widespread increases, from higher Muni fares( raising rates to $ 1.25 a ride) to widening the scope of the payroll/gross receipts tax, increasing fees at city parking garages and even a tax on automobile rentals. <p> Unlike the federal government, which can borrow against future revenue, the city must maintain a balanced budget. And the money spent by local governments -- last year San Francisco spent $ 2.7 billion -- involve programs that are close to home, such as parks, hospitals and street cleaners. <p> Faced with a projected $ 188 million deficit for the 1993-94 year, Jordan would have to raise an additional $ 250 per resident to maintain current services. Instead, he has decided to make up the deficit using the following formula : 50 percent with labor concessions, 25 percent with program cuts, and another 25 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE PUBLIC ' <p> " As it gets played out in its gory details, it will revolt the public, " said Supervisor Carole Migden, who has teamed up with Jordan in placing pressure on the unions to accept lower wages. <p> " The idea is not to create a budget you 're in love with, but one you can live with, " said Migden, who will conduct public hearings on the mayor 's budget in June. <p> The budget battle will be the greatest test yet of Jordan 's political ability. The disputes over financing will commence in earnest when he makes his budget public June 1 and will continue through most of June and July as the Board of Supervisors conducts hearings. <p> Jordan has tried to ease the pressure by holding lengthy budget meetings with labor and business leaders, department heads and with residents in a series of neighborhood gatherings. <p> But the meetings have produced little consensus. Predictably, residents want lower taxes and more services. Labor says that the problems could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem could be solved by layoffs and wage freezes. And department heads insist they can not cut without harming the public. <p> " Some of the discussions have been brutal, " said Jim Wunderman, Jordan 's administrative chief. " Many of the discussions have involved making radical changes in departments, and they have been greeted with strong reactions. " <p> PROPOSITION 13 BLAMED <p> The city 's budget crisis has its roots in 1978, when California voters passed a law limiting the government 's ability to tax. <p> " Before Proposition 13, the mayor had a relatively easy job, " recalls Harvey Rose, the Board of Supervisors ' veteran budget analyst. " You added up all your revenues and all your expenditures, then... you just socked it to the taxpayers. " <p> As tax revenues declined, public spending did not. <p> Over the past 10 years, per capita spending by San Francisco city government, after adjustment for the cost of living, has increased nearly 23 percent. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service, which nearly doubled, transportation, commerce and community health. <p> At the same time, wages grew considerably faster than those of workers in private industries as the result of a rigid pay formula approved by voters. <p> The watershed year was 1985, when the annual budget surplus disappeared and the city faced a $ 76 million shortage. Each year since, mayors have been faced with projected deficits and have somehow balanced the budget. But they have done little to fix the institutional problem. <p> " We had the same problem then that we have now, " Rose said. " We have continued to spend more than we take in on an ongoing basis. " <p> NO BAILOUT IN SIGHT <p> Last year, the city got out of its jam by borrowing $ 25 million from the airport and adjusting the amount it contributes to its employees ' retirement fund. This year there is no obvious bailout in sight. <p> " For a long time we 've been using one-time fixes, " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were using up our reserves until there was nothing left. " <p> And it has become increasingly difficult to convince the public, which has become accustomed to the last-minute bailouts, that there is a crisis. <p> " Every year we come up and say you ca n't spend at the same rate or you 'll be in trouble, " Madden said. " It 's like you 're crying wolf. I do n't think people believe us anymore. " <p> But as taxes rise and services are cut, financial officers said the budget problems will become increasingly noticeable. <p> " This is n't about cutting around the ends, " Madden said. " This is about not performing some of the services we provide. We have got to be honest with people and say, ' Sorry, some of those things we did before we ca n't do anymore. ' " <p> Jordan 's aides insist that this year 's budget will contain some fundamental reforms that will make future budgets easier to balance. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's charter that would create greater flexibility in balancing the budget. <p> He has been prodded by the civil grand jury, which criticized the use of one-time fixes to balance last year 's budget, and by the Mayor 's Fiscal Advisory Committee, which has outlined numerous steps to shrink the size of government and urged him repeatedly to act. <p> With the state economy still in trouble, most observers say they believe that things will probably get worse before they get better, intensifying the demonstrations on behalf of health clinics and libraries. <p> " I think it 's the real animal were carving on now, " said Kent Sims, the mayor 's director of economic development. <p> CHART :( 1) <p> SPENDING IN SAN FRANCISCO San Francisco 's $2.7 billion budget includes a $1.44 billion general fund, which is the bread and butter of city spending, supporting services ranging from police protection to general assistance.
