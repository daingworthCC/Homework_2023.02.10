4022741 For six years, the world has witnessed an intriguing phenomenon : Oil prices have soared as the US dollar has declined in value. // Now some economists say the simplest way to ease oil prices in the short term is to boost the value of the greenback. // It 's a controversial idea. Clearly, oil prices are driven mainly by the fundamental trends of oil supply and demand. And even if an oil-dollar link does exist, economists say it 's not clear that the dollar 's downward trend can - or should - be reversed. Some say a weaker dollar is needed to help reverse America 's large trade imbalance over time. // Still, with oil prices near record levels, concern about the dollar 's dive is getting more attention. // " Increase the value of the dollar and lower the value of the euro. That by itself will lower oil prices, assuming all other things being equal, " says A.F. Alhajji, an energy economist at Ohio Northern University in Ada. Beyond that, he says, the world will basically need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // If a steadier dollar would help, one positive sign is that the greenback has firmed up a bit in the past three months. But it 's not clear how much it would need to rise - or how long it would take after that - to influence oil prices. // Algerian Energy Minister Chakib Khelil, the current president of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, said Thursday that the dollar is playing a major role in oil prices, and offered a hard estimate, according to a report by Marketwatch. At a meeting in Paris, he said a drop of 1 to 2 percent in the dollar versus the euro could add another $8 a barrel to oil prices. // The dollar-oil issue also came up Wednesday in a congressional hearing on whether high fuel prices are a bubble or a " new reality. " // " While the correlation does not hold week in and week out, we believe that this trend - a falling dollar contributing to higher oil prices - is very strong, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Economists who see a dollar-to-oil link say it 's operating through several channels, some long term and some short term : // A supply effect : The fact that oil is priced in a single currency worldwide - the US dollar - has significant effects on companies and nations that produce oil, Professor Alhajji says. // A rising price of oil has clearly brought billions in extra profits. But since the dollars that producers receive have gone down in value, that windfall has been partially offset. // As a result, he says, the oil-rich nations have probably been investing less in new oil production than they would have under a stable dollar. // Some analysts cast the impact on oil production in investment terms : If a nation 's immediate economic needs are being met, why swap an asset that 's rising in value( oil reserves) for one that 's falling( dollars)? // A demand effect : Oil prices have been rising for consumers around the world. But this, too, has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates. Europeans are buying more oil than they would if the US dollar were their currency. // " Because the dollar ca n't fall against the government-managed Asian currencies, it falls too much against the euro, " says Peter Morici, an economist at the University of Maryland in College Park. " That gives Europeans more " to spend on oil. // A different effect is at work in China, which he says has been holding its currency artificially low as a way to boost exports. The result, Professor Morici argues, is a greater shift of manufacturing jobs out of the United States and into China. And because US factories use much less energy than those in China, this affects demand for oil. // " Every time a job leaves Indiana for Shanghai, oil consumption goes up, " Morici says. // Moreover, in his view, China 's resulting trade surplus has enabled the country to afford the artificially low fuel prices it sets for consumers - prices that China adjusted upward last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much oil demand has been affected by China 's currency-managing methods. " Given the rapid economic growth rate,... I would argue that demand from China would still be relatively robust " regardless of the exchange-rate policies, says Paul Ting, who runs an energy consultancy in Short Hills, N.J. // A financial effect : Low interest rates or rising inflation can cause investors to flee a currency. Those same rates can help drive up commodity prices and cause investors to buy oil contracts as a " hedge " against feared inflation. // One symbol of the problem : Investors holding US dollars now face negative real returns - interest rates below inflation. // The Federal Reserve has reduced short-term US interest rates to counter the threat of recession, but now is walking a fine line as markets increasingly are also worried about inflation. // " The more that people doubt the Federal Reserve 's willingness to reverse this policy course they 've chosen, the higher oil prices rise, " says Tim Duy, an economist at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the Fed would focus on helping the economy out of its slump. This month, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said the Fed is now also " attentive " to downward pressure on the dollar. // Economists say that much of the global inflation pressure comes from emerging nations. They have kept money supply relatively loose, partly because their dollar-pegged exchange rates effectively link their monetary policy to that of the Fed. // Managed currency rates and fuel-price controls have put particular pressure on oil prices, Merrill Lynch analysts argue in a recent report. " As neither emerging market exchange rates nor domestic commodity prices could adjust through market mechanisms, world commodity price... had to trend sharply higher in an effort to slow down demand, " they write. // So it may be a range of exchange rates, not just the dollar, that 's affecting oil prices. // How could the dollar be strengthened? // It might happen naturally, if markets decide that the greenback has dropped below its fair value. // Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency trades in a concerted way to to affect the dollar. // on dollars. //( c) Copyright 2008.
