3053741 <p> Ernest Givins, the Oilers ' career receiving leader, is gone, but he does n't plan to be forgotten. Waived by the Oilers to clear money under the salary cap, he signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars. <p> And when the Oilers begin the season Sept. 3 at Jacksonville, Givins plans to celebrate his 31st birthday with a victory over his former team. He predicts the Oilers will have to watch his Electric Slide touchdown dance. <p> " " I 'm planning a couple of celebrations in the end zone, " he says. " " One for my birthday and one for the Oilers. " <p> Oilers coach Jeff Fisher says Givins has another thing coming if he thinks he is going to do the Electric Slide against his former teammates. <p> " " If Ernest is going to do his end-zone dance two times when we 're there, he must mean before and after the game, " Fisher says. <p> The Oilers wanted to re-sign Givins for a lot less money, but he elected to go home to Florida and be reunited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Houston gave me a raw deal, " Givins says. " " I understand the salary cap had something to do with the Oilers ' decision to release me, but do n't slap me in the face with a stupid offer. I can understand them wanting me to take a pay cut. But they wanted me to go from being one of the highest-paid receivers in the league to one of the lowest. They know I can still get what I need somewhere else and that I still have three more years in me. " <p> Givins, who resides in St. Petersburg, Fla., in the offseason, spent nine seasons with the Oilers and figured he would end his career in Houston. He became expendable when the coaches ' emphasis changed to larger receivers rather than run-and-shoot types. Givins was coming off the most unproductive season of his career, but he plans to bounce back for the Jaguars. <p> " " I go from being the Oilers ' all-time leading receiver, and all of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says. " " Now they want to bring in some big receivers. That 's why I made the move. I did n't get the respect at the beginning of my career, and I certainly did n't get it at the tail end or I 'd still be in Houston right now. I needed a new site, a new team and a new uniform, and that 's what I 've got. " <p> Name that line -- The Oilers ' offensive linemen and Weston Lakes Country Club will host a celebrity golf tournament Oct.10-11 -- the AFC Central 's week off -- to benefit the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. <p> In conjunction with the tournament, fans are being asked to name the Oilers ' offensive line in a contest that will run until the week before the start of the regular season. The four finalists will earn places in the tournament, and the winner will make a road trip to an Oilers ' game. <p> There will be a practice round Oct. 10 followed by a reception, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played the next day followed by a dinner. Entry blanks will run three times in the Chronicle. <p> As one wag discussed the contract problems involving guard Bruce Matthews and tackle David Williams, he suggested " " The Holdouts " as the line 's nickname. <p> By the way, Weston Lakes will also be the site of coach Jeff Fisher 's first celebrity tournament in May. <p> Matthews ' tender removed -- Saturday was the deadline for unrestricted free agents who were tendered offers June 1 to sign with other clubs. Their former teams have sole negotiating rights. <p> The Oilers removed their $ 2.4-million tender from guard Bruce Matthews because it would have automatically counted against the salary cap Saturday. All it means is that Matthews can continue negotiating with other teams, but he does not count against the salary cap until he signs with the Oilers. <p> Matthews likes to dip -- Bruce Matthews may not be able to hold out long before he signs the four-year contract for more than $ 10 million. Matthews has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spicy Jones Texas Grilling and Dipping Sauce on it. <p> Matthews, who spends most of the offseason working with his 2MQ Construction company, has invested in the Spicy Jones sauces. <p> Spicy Jones is a Houston company, and the product can be found in some of the city 's more upscale markets. Matthews says he likes the sauce so much he puts it on everything but the football. <p> A real Trooper -- One of the NFL 's better programs involves teams taking a minority coach from college to training camp. This year 's coach is Trooper Taylor from Baylor. Taylor, who played defensive back for the Bears and has been one of their best coaches and recruiters, will work with the secondary. <p> Boselli 's big deal -- Of the high No. 1 draft choices, the only one signed is Jacksonville offensive tackle Tony Boselli, the second overall pick. He was taken one spot ahead of Oilers quarterback Steve McNair. Boselli signed a seven-year contract for $ 17 million, including a $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a seven-year contract that is not voidable at some point, the club will have to pay dearly up front. <p> Best since Tarkenton -- Green Bay general manager Ron Wolf, who spent 25 years in the Raiders ' front office before joining the Packers four years ago, is impressed with Steve McNair. Wolf believes McNair could be playing sooner than a lot of people think. <p> " " I do n't think he 'll take as long to develop as some people think because he has a magnificent gift to avoid the rush and buy time to throw, " Wolf says. " " He gives you a dimension I do n't think anybody has. He 's the reincarnation of Fran Tarkenton, but he 's better than Tarkenton. " <p> Wolf is n't talking about McNair being the reincarnation of Tarkenton as a quarterback. " " I 'm talking about McNair 's ability to buy time to throw, not just to run, " he says. <p> Moon likes McNair -- Former Oilers quarterback Warren Moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draft Steve McNair. <p> " " They talked about him the whole season, " Moon says. " " Our scouts were in love with him. They felt it would be perfect for him to come in behind me for a year or so and then be ready to take over. He was the guy they really wanted. There 's no question Steve was the class of the draft as far as quarterbacks. <p> " " Where Steve needs the most help right now is his fundamentals and techniques. He was in the shotgun so much that he never really was a drop-back passer since early in his college career. Now he 's going to have to get up under the center and drop back to throw. <p> " " His mechanics will have to change a little bit. But as far as knowing the game and learning it, I do n't think it will be any more difficult for him than any other guys that comes into the league. Whether you are Troy Aikman or John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well in the NFL. All those guys struggled when they first came in the league. " <p> Oilers offensive coordinator Jerry Rhome coached the Vikings receivers last season. Moon believes McNair will benefit from playing under Rhome. <p> " " One of the great things in his favor is Steve is going to have a great guy to coach him in Jerry, " Moon says. " " He 's the best person Steve could have because Jerry has played the position and he has the right temperament and personality to teach. I learned a lot from him just in the one year I was with him. " <p> Dishman hot property -- Oilers cornerback Cris Dishman is entering the last year of his contract and becomes an unrestricted free agent next year. He makes $ 2 million this season, and if he plays well, he should become one of the hottest players on the market. Besides pass rushers, there is nothing like a cornerback who majors in man coverage to get a coach 's heart pumping. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent two months in San Diego working on a football-oriented conditioning program designed by Rahn Sheffield, the San Diego State University women 's track coach. It is designed to improve speed, quickness and endurance. <p> Before he left Sheffield, Dishman was clocked in a 21.03 in 200 meters, which translates to 4.3 in the 40-yard dash. His teammates will have to see it on the field before they believe he is that fast. <p> The fight game -- Arizona coach Buddy Ryan, who earned notoriety for his inept right cross in 1993, has purchased a minority interest in the managerial contract of Frankie Rhodes, a middleweight from Cincinnati. <p> " " His right hand is much better than mine, " Ryan says. Kevin Gilbride would agree. <p> No Gator Bowl -- The Oilers begin the regular season Sept. 3 at Jacksonville Municipal Stadium, formerly the Gator Bowl. The 80,000-seat stadium was gutted and rebuilt and should have a new name by the time the Oilers appear. The city is hoping a corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name to the stadium. <p> Trouble in Detroit -- Another quarterback controversy is brewing in Detroit with Steve Walsh and Erik Kramer. Walsh replaced Kramer last season and guided the Bears to the playoffs. <p> " " The controversy is a pain in the butt, " Walsh says. " " I 'm not going to be a very good interview. I 've been in quarterback controversies with Troy Aikman in Dallas and Bobby Hebert and Wade Wilson in New Orleans. I 'm not going to get all caught up in it this time.
