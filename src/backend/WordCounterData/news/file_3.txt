3000641 <p> It was just a normal summer day when Allan Houston stopped his workout in midchurn, stepped off the stationary bike and ducked into a film room at the Knicks ' practice facility. <p> Just once, he wanted to see it for himself. Not the highlight version, but the frame-by-frame account on a game film that rolled without announcers, color commentators or " SportsCenter " anchors to infringe on the delicate balance of the moment. Completely alone, Houston slipped in the videocassette marked Miami Game 5 : May 16, 1999, and watched himself calmly search for one shaft of light, one opening to part and flip up a one-handed runner that licked the rim, tapped the glass and fell through the net as gently as a droplet. <p> The pull of gravity. Through its force, the shot that hung in the air of Miami Arena -- and held the future of the Knicks ' franchise in suspense -- came down with eight-tenths of a second on the clock. At that instance, the Heat 's devastation became the Knicks ' salvation. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and I 'll always keep with me, " said Houston, who will be face to face with the Heat tonight at Madison Square Garden for the two rivals ' first meeting of the season. " There was a lot riding on it. But I never think about that. I just think about the fact that we gave ourselves a chance. If you give yourself a chance, all you can do is make or miss. " <p> Under extreme circumstances, the difference between the two can change everything. Something happened to Houston on the day he made what the Knicks refer to as the Shot. He does n't really see it, but then the modest Houston is n't the type to check out his reflection as he walks by a mirror. <p> If he did, he might notice what others do. The unassuming shooting guard who arrived in New York four years ago with his shoulders slumped, head down and a voice that rarely broke a whisper has been heard stirring up his teammates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes, you hear him and you say to yourself, ' Is that Allan? ' " Marcus Camby said. " I have n't been around him all that long. But you can see the carry-over from the Shot. He 's more vocal, and he 's a captain now. I guess everything was sort of put into motion that day. And I know one thing, we all respect Allan. " <p> This unselfish son of a coach, whose natural instinct was to blend into the background behind Patrick Ewing and then Latrell Sprewell, has finally found his place in the universe of basketball, settling in next to the elite of the league. <p> " Everyone wants to talk about the Shot, " Coach Jeff Van Gundy said. " But he was struggling in that game until the fourth quarter. It showed his maturity to go from struggling to making a big shot when it matters most. From that moment on, he started to separate himself from the other good shooting guards. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a struggle for Houston, much like it is for anyone shy in nature to find the courage to stand up and be seen in front of an audience. Often, he would disappear at the Garden like a stand-in on the stage, giving way to the takeover mentality of John Starks or Ewing. This was what the Knicks got for a $56 million investment? A wallflower? <p> It was a difficult initiation for Houston. He had left Detroit for a fast-paced city that did not seem to fit his loping ways, for a coach who did not trust him to deliver in a big situation and for a team that was heavy on ego he did not possess. <p> " When I came here, there was n't a red carpet rolled out for me, " Houston said. " But you know, I would n't have had it any other way. I was pushed. " <p> Instead of giving up his milk money to the bullying Knicks, Houston pushed back, pushed harder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of discovery was not already under way when Houston delivered in Miami, but that moment pressed the accelerator. <p> If he had missed, who knows? He might have slipped back. The franchise might have been dismantled. His coach would have most likely been fired, and the ramifications might have left this most sensitive of players in mental disarray. <p> Instead, the shot fell, and the Knicks ' star-aligned run through the playoffs and into the finals began. Houston was there the whole way. If there is any statistic that reveals just how much impact Houston has on his team, it 's the record of the Knicks during the playoffs last year when he led the team in scoring : 5-0. <p> " To me, scorers, when they score big and they lose, they 're not doing their job as superstars, " said the Knicks ' assistant coach Don Chaney, who was the head coach at Detroit during Houston 's 1993-94 rookie season. " If you make the players around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent. If you get big numbers and no one else is scoring, the chances are that one man is not going to beat anybody. " <p> Even as stardom has become as comfortable a fit as a favorite chair for Houston, even as the label of captain that Van Gundy asked him to wear on the team plane trip to training camp in Charleston, S.C., seems to suit him now, Houston is just as unselfish as before. But there is a difference between deferring with a pedestrian pass in the perimeter world he used to live in as the shooter, and creating opportunities for others with an aggressive drive to the basket. <p> " He 's still a great shooter, but you see him being so assertive now, " said Grant Hill, Houston 's former Detroit teammate. " I was watching the playoffs, and I think that 's the biggest change. He 's driving to the basket and kicking the ball out to his teammates. He 's a complete player. " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if it was the Shot or maybe just the accumulation of his run in the playoffs and his experience on the Olympic team this summer, but if that shot is what catapulted him, great, " Van Gundy said. <p> Whatever it is, Houston has sprung to life in the early stages of this season. After a career of shooting in the high 30 's and low 40 's before January, Houston has opened the season hitting at a rate of 53 percent and averaging 22.4 points a game. <p> " I ca n't say the Shot made Allan Houston, because he was a player prior to that, but it really, to me, took him to another level in terms of superstardom, " Chaney said. " I think now Allan believes he can score on anyone in the league. And I think, late in a game, he knows he can make any basket. " <p> He has seen proof, sitting alone in front of a VCR. <p> " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Houston said. " This is my sixth year in the league and I went through a lot to get to that shot. But if people want to consider it that, fine. To me, it 's not a turning point or a beginning. The bottom line is, the shot went in. " <p> http : //www.nytimes.com
