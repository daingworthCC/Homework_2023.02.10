4191341 <p> Jets quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick smiled this week when asked if he finds the week-to-week swings in the NFL amusing. <p> " Yeah, that 's been my life for 12 years, " Fitzpatrick said. <p> The past two weeks gave Fitzpatrick both ends of the NFL spectrum. Two weeks ago in Buffalo, he played one of his best games, throwing for nearly 400 yards in a win over the Bills and was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week. Last week, he threw six interceptions against the Chiefs, and suddenly no one was asking about how unstoppable the Jets offense could be. <p> " That 's why I kind of always preach just staying level and trying to be the same guy, " Fitzpatrick said. " I just think that 's really important. That would be crazy if I could sandwich two Players of Week around that awful game, but that 's just something that ca n't happen. <p> " We 're always preaching consistency and being able to execute, and that 's something that ca n't happen again in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced the Seahawks just twice as a starter, once with the Bills in 2012 and once with the Titans in 2013. He is 0-2 against the them, completing 38 of 67 passes for 388 yards with one touchdown and four interceptions for a 53.6 rating. <p> Robby Anderson has gone from undrafted free agent to training camp star to part-time player, and now may be starting Sunday against the Seahawks. Anderson will see the biggest jump in playing time because of Eric Decker 's shoulder injury. The rookie wide receiver is looking forward to the chance. <p> " My mindset, even though I was undrafted, that put a chip on my shoulder, " Anderson said. " I did n't come here just to say I was a Jet. I came here to potentially be a starter. My whole life, that 's what I 've been working to become. " <p> Anderson had his first career catch last week in Kansas City. He gives the Jets an interesting dimension as a deep threat that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The Seahawks went 5-0 against the Jets at Shea Stadium and 0-5 against them at Giants Stadium, the Jets ' previous two homes. The two teams never have played at MetLife Stadium. The Seahawks do have some experience in the stadium, though. They are 2-0 there against the Giants and won Super Bowl XLVIII there over the Broncos after the 2013 season.... The Seahawks are 7-5 in their past 12 games that started at 1 p.m. Eastern Time.
