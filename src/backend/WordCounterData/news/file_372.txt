3063741 <p> The Civic Federation commends the Sun-Times for its editorial on the Cook County budget " A flicker of hope for full-scale rebellion, " Dec. 12 We call on Cook County officials to balance their budget without raising taxes. There are many other ways the county 's budget can be balanced without layoffs or service cuts. Although a vote on the county 's fiscal 2004 $2.9 billion budget was postponed last week, commissioners continue to discuss unnecessary tax increases. The Civic Federation has maintained that county officials could balance the budget with a number of alternative strategies : <p> *Save $124 million by freezing appropriations at the 2003 level and cutting costs. <p> *Save $61 million by eliminating vacancies and regularly unspent appropriations. <p> *Save $60 million by limiting appropriations to natural revenue growth from existing taxes and fees. <p> *Save $37 million by increasing last year 's appropriation by only 3 percent. <p> *Save up to $5 million by outsourcing janitorial services at the courthouses. <p> While Cook County faces a short-term problem in eliminating an $86 million deficit in 2004, it faces a much bigger long-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiently. There is no shortage of long-term cost-cutting ideas from civic organizations and the county 's own research reports. Most of these recommendations have yet to be acted upon. Cook County government must put its fiscal house in order, and imposing fiscal discipline and implementing management efficiencies should be the first line of attack. Only as a last resort should tax increases even be considered. <p> Laurence Msall, president, <p> The Civic Federation <p> No dimes for Reagan <p> Partisan politics have stooped to pick up a new low, as Rep. Mark Souder( R-Ind.) and 80 other Republicans try to replace Franklin Delano Roosevelt 's face on the dime with Ronald Reagan 's. <p> Apparently it 's not enough for Republicans to own most of the dimes( and other currency denominations) in the country, so now they feel the need to re-engrave them in their own image. Or maybe they think the New Dime would afford them some revenge for the New Deal. <p> The fact is that no coin 's image bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dimes began through FDR 's founding of an organization that researched the cure for the infantile paralysis from which he suffered. The dimes contributed by our Depression-era ancestors to conquer diseases such as polio demonstrate the power of simple American volunteerism. <p> On the other side, Reagan 's claim to the coin is supposed to be the size of John Hinckley 's deflected bullet. <p> So let 's compromise. Why not leave FDR on one side of the dime, and put Reagan on the other? History will tell us which is the head and which is the tail. <p> Dan Duffy, Oak Park <p> Women deserve equal pay <p> When I read that women earn only 79.7 percent of what men earn for doing the same job " Quick Takes column, Nov. 24, and that 's down from 80 percent 20 years ago, I am appalled. Women covered by union contracts earn the exact amount as men doing the same job, and have for years. <p> When is corporate America going to stop treating working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 20 percent less if she worked for them? I do n't think so. Corporate America : Be fair to all women. <p> James M. Hogan, <p> administrator, <p> Teamsters Local 714, Berwyn <p> More AIDS orphans <p> The teen girls and other children who contracted HIV at birth in the early 1990s have thankfully survived and flourished " AIDS kids were n't supposed to live, " metro story, Nov. 23, but we must recognize not only that HIV newborn transmission remains fatal, but also just as worrisome that " AIDS orphans " among low-income minorities are escalating. <p> Only last year, 3-year-old " Tanya " succumbed to AIDS at The Children 's Place Association residence that cares for low-income HIV/AIDS infants and toddlers. Despite the new medications, children like Tanya still are coming to us for help. And children without the disease, but whose parents are suffering and dying from the disease, are growing and leaving more " AIDS orphans " within Chicago 's minority communities. <p> Here in Chicago, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is forcing Children 's Place to expand beyond its two Humboldt Park child care facilities and open a third in Chicago 's Grand Boulevard neighborhood in spring 2004. <p> AIDS continues to menace poor children without access to adequate care. They still die from the disease and, increasingly, so do their parents. <p> Cathy Krieger, president, <p> The Children 's Place <p> Association, West Town <p> No pandering for Paul Simon <p> I recall an incident that illustrates why Paul Simon had such a positive reputation. When Paul Simon ran for the Senate, there were three other candidates in that primary race. A pro-Israel political action committee( to Protect Our Heritage) invited all four candidates to present their views on the Arab-Israeli conflict. <p> While Paul Simon 's presentation was very positive in being supportive of Israel, he actually said the least of what we wanted to hear from these four candidates. When it came to choosing a candidate, the PAC selected Paul Simon. He came across as someone who had thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought. The other candidates appeared to simply read statements given to them by their staff, involving little knowledge or conviction of their own. <p> Pandering was simply not Paul Simon 's way of gathering support. <p> Jona Cohn, Morton Grove <p> Fund-raisers over funeral <p> Instead of attending the funeral of just one soldier who gave his or her life serving at President Bush 's pleasure, he has attended more than 35 fund-raisers since June, and Vice President Dick Cheney has attended more than 31. <p> Mr. President, you are setting a fine example to our youth as to why they should not enlist in the military or vote for you in 2004. <p> Yvonne B. Garstki, Lombard <p> Truth about Japan and POWs <p> The article about Japanese brutality toward American POWs was overdue " WWII POW 's story spurs Council to seek amends, " Dec. 5. Thanks to Ald. James Balcer( 11th) for his resolution to seek reparations from the Japanese. It 's about time someone had the courage to address this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrialists considered the Japanese a sacred cow because of their investments in America and political clout -- people did n't want to offend them. The brutality, beatings, starvation and inhumane treatment of our POWs who were captured by the Japanese during WWII is well-documented in books, movies and newspapers of that era. <p> Thanks to the courage of Balcer and his co-sponsors, the resolution should and will become a law. During the former President Ronald Reagan administration 's love affair with the Japanese, issues like this were never mentioned because Japanese money influenced our political system significantly. <p> Louis Stehlik, Woodridge <p> Why was killer on parole? <p> It appears that the man charged in connection with the murders of three teenage boys in Hammond, Ind., is a convicted murderer out on parole. The murder conviction is for the murder of a 15-year-old boy. Someone has to explain to me how a convicted murderer -- let alone a convicted murderer of a child -- gets out on parole. <p> People such as myself who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing that battle. But how does parole even enter into the equation? The issue should be the death penalty vs. life in prison without the possibility of parole -- not parole vs. continued prison time. <p> Words we should never see in print again are " paroled child-killer. " Imagine the relatives and loved ones of the victims in Hammond, how terrible their loss is, and then to learn that the killer, with the authorities fully aware of his past, was set free. <p> Chris E. Limperis, <p> Oakbrook Terrace <p> MY TWO CENTS <p> " No coin 's image bears more significance than the Roosevelt dime. The March of Dimes began through FDR 's founding of an organization that researched the cure for the infantile paralysis... Reagan 's claim to the coin is supposed to be the size of Hinckley 's deflected bullet. " -- Dan Duffy
