3054741 <p> Censoring porn not a cure <p> It will be a serious mistake if we censor the Internet in our efforts to make it " safer " for children. With the best of intentions, we could produce a cure far worse than the disease. <p> There are tens of thousands of sexually oriented web sites and some of them have automatic counters that show hundreds of millions of " visits. " <p> No one knows how many of those visitors are children. Nearly all teens know they can see explicit sex in high-resolution if they tell a little electronic fib. They just agree with a statement declaring they are over 18. <p> We can assume that there are hundreds of millions of teen visits at pornographic web sites each month. If viewing pornography causes people to commit sex offenses, then it should produce an explosive crime wave. <p> Melanie Markley 's Dec. 4 Chronicle article indicated an 82 percent decrease in sex offenses in Houston Independent School District schools from 1996 to 1997, in spite of greatly increased Internet activity among kids covered by those statistics. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pornography decreases sex crimes, but lifting restrictions on porn sales in Denmark did reduce sex crimes there. Scientific studies have predicted the same results in this country. <p> Meanwhile, there is no evidence that viewing pornography is harmful, and no evidence that sex crimes result from the mushrooming growth of Internet porn. <p> Politicians who want to censor the Internet need to explain why they think Americans are damaged by pornography when Europeans and Asians are not. <p> People never seem to learn that repression is always much worse than expression. <p> Carl Veley, Houston <p> Dodds due kudos, not criticisms <p> The Chronicle Dec. 3 editorial, " Rise and fall : How far will UT go to win, and for what purpose? " suggests, among other things, that Deloss Dodds, the University of Texas athletic director, should be held responsible for leading UT to an obsession with winning where " the athletic tail wags the academic dog " and for mistakenly extending John Mackovic 's contract two years ago, now at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first point is misdirected. It should be clear that Dodds, while responsible for the intercollegiate athletic program at UT and, therefore, the academic performance of UT 's student-athletes, is not responsible for overall academic priorities as is UT 's president, to whom Dodds reports. <p> Further, the chancellor and the board of regents of the UT system are solely responsible for the academic and athletic policies throughout the UT system, including UT-Austin. <p> It is worth noting that the chancellor and the regents, while accepting that football and other intercollegiate athletic programs are an important part of the mosaic which makes up college life, in no way believe they are the most important piece of that mosaic. <p> Dodds ' understanding of this fundamental point is clearly reflected by the graduation rate of UT student-athletes which, under his leadership, is now higher than any other school in the Big 12. <p> With respect to your suggestion that Dodds has made mistakes in his position of leadership, what great leader has not? Dodds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the incredibly successful record of UT intercollegiate athletics during his tenure, which includes, among other things, five national championships in swimming and diving, one national championship in baseball and a total of 59 conference titles, including 10 in baseball, four in basketball, two in cross country, five in football, eight in golf, 16 in swimming, three in tennis, three in indoor track and eight in outdoor track. <p> Because of his achievements, his leadership and his forthright and easy manner, Dodds has been highly regarded and fully supported by every president and board of regents under whom he has served during the last 17 years, including those currently serving. <p> Beyond the University of Texas, he is widely regarded as one of the best athletic directors in the nation. He is a tremendous asset to the University of Texas and deserves the support of all the Longhorn faithful. <p> Although your editorial was somewhat misdirected and told only part of the story, thank you for your continued great service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board of regents, the University of Texas System <p> Sprewell stepped over line <p> Hurrah for the National Basketball Association. It 's about time some restraint be placed on players who make millions passing a ball around and thus think they have privileges and rights far above that of the average citizen. Sprewell simply overstepped the bounds which have been approached by too many players. It is well known that coaches are often outspoken, but no player is forced to play. Let him quit and try to find a job - I suspect he could n't hold a regular one. <p> J.H.U. Brown, Houston <p> A ' Camelot ' transparency <p> My personal opinions of the Kennedy family have finally been validated by the mainstream media. I hope this serves as a wake-up call for Americans who fell prey to the " Camelot years. " <p> J. Collins, Spring <p> Fed up with Janet Reno <p> Like a lot of Americans now, I am fed up with Janet Reno 's evasive stonewalling in an obvious attempt to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poppycock and show clearly a conflict of interest. <p> Reno is thumbing her nose at the American people, Congress and the news media who all have asked for an independent counsel. She is flaunting the laws she swore to uphold. All of this leaves an impression of a lack of honesty and integrity on her part, and she should be cited for contempt or impeached. She is not above the law. <p> Hazel O. Edwards, Houston <p> Taxes on telephone bills <p> I understand we should be thanking Bill Clinton and Al Gore and the Federal Communications Commission for a tax hike coming Jan. 1 on our phone bill. <p> For obvious reasons, it will not be called a tax, but will be labeled a " universal service contribution " and will cost something like $ 25 annually per household to pay for school and library connects to the Internet. This added tax will cost the average Social Security recipient about 12 percent of their 2.1 percent cost-of-living pay raises, bringing it down to an effective 1.8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the taxes on our telephone bills were called exactly what they are and itemized so that the voting citizen will know just how much of their money is being taken from them. <p> John H. Hoover, Houston <p> Boot camp preferable? <p> Louis Clemons, the 14-year-old videotaped robber sentenced to boot camp, will profit greatly from the structure and discipline of this program( Chronicle, Dec. 11). I participated in a worship service at the boot camp in Atascocita last Sunday with First Presbyterian Church and was very impressed by the attention and respect the inmates gave our group. Later we met with a group of women about to be released from the facility who expressed gratitude for their experience there. As harsh as boot camp may be, for many it is preferable to and more beneficial than the unstructured hours of prison life. Louis Clemons is in my prayers. <p> Margaret Miller, Houston
