3003541 <p> When Nabil al-Marabh was caught trying to sneak into the United States from Canada last June, American officials had plenty of reason to believe that he was up to no good. <p> Nine months earlier, he had been identified to American intelligence agents as one of Osama bin Laden 's operatives in the United States. American customs agents knew about money he had transferred to an associate of Osama bin Laden in the Middle East. And the Boston police had issued a warrant for his arrest after he violated probation for stabbing a friend with a knife. <p> But when American immigration officials discovered him at the Niagara Falls border crossing, stowed inside a tractor-trailer and carrying a forged passport, they simply let him go. <p> They turned him back to the Canadians, who released him on bail after his lawyer argued that he would be kept in line by an uncle who was a religious man. What the lawyer neglected to note was that the uncle worked for an Islamic school in Toronto headed by a man long identified by Canadian intelligence as a terrorist. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, moving three times in the next eight weeks. Only after hijacked planes slammed into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon did officials go hunting him. They found him -- with help from a personal injury lawyer -- behind the counter at a suburban Chicago liquor store, and moved him to New York, where a grand jury is hearing evidence. Investigators would not discuss his case in detail, but they believe that he might be connected to two hijackers, and to a significant informant on Mr. bin Laden 's operations in North America. <p> While much remains unclear, the authorities ' handling of Mr. Marabh, pieced together from public records and interviews with law enforcement officials and people who knew him, raises questions about how seriously American officials took the bin Laden threat before Sept. 11. It suggests a problem of not simply porous borders, but a lack of coordination among law enforcement and intelligence officials. In the end, Mr. Marabh seems to have slipped through not just one set of fingers, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his ties to the bin Laden network, Mr. Marabh moved about unfettered -- traveling around the country, moving large amounts of money, getting duplicate driver 's licenses and forging immigration documents. <p> When he was jailed briefly by Canadian immigration officials after his border crossing attempt in June, Mr. Marabh boasted to his cellmates that he was " special " to the F.B.I. But he may have been the only one who realized it. <p> Mr. Marabh, 34, was born in Kuwait, but claimed Syrian citizenship when he applied for political asylum in Canada in 1994. He was denied, and after being forcibly deported in 1995, returned to Boston, where he had first lived in 1989. <p> According to people who knew him, he lived a life that seemed in many ways devout and modest, praying five times a day, living in an apartment furnished with little more than a computer and a television, paying his rent promptly each month with crinkled 10- and 20-dollar bills he earned driving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defiant. He dressed in perfectly pressed pants and expensive shirts, quibbled with a police officer who accused him of using a profanity, and when stopped at the border, insisted that he would be represented by a prominent Toronto lawyer. <p> " I told him on more than one occasion to lighten up, " said Robert F. Menton, a court-appointed lawyer who represented him on a charge in Boston in 2000. " He never did. The impression I had was that he was a wealthy man from Kuwait, and that he was used to being treated better than everyone else. " <p> When he was caught in the back of the truck in June, Mr. Marabh told immigration officials he was " stateless. " And in many ways, he had begun to act as though he was. Starting in 1999, he began to bounce between Florida, Boston, Detroit and Toronto. He collected driver 's licenses like baseball cards, and although he had married a Vietnamese woman, they spent long stretches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come to stay with them after what his wife recalled as a fight over who would clean up. <p> The F.B.I. was aware of him as early as August 1999, when agents arrived at Mr. Marabh 's second-floor apartment in a triple-decker house in Boston to quiz him about a man Mr. Marabh 's wife, now estranged, recalled only as Ahmed. <p> But it was his friendship with Raed Hijazi that ultimately led intelligence officials to Mr. Marabh. <p> Mr. Hijazi, a former business school student born in California, was arrested in October 2000 in Syria on charges that he had conspired to blow up tourist sites in Jordan on the eve of the millennium, a plot that had been foiled in November 1999 by Jordanian intelligence. <p> He confessed to the charges, telling Jordanian and American intelligence officials soon after his arrest of his initiation into Al Qaeda, the organization Mr. bin Laden founded to wage holy war. He also identified Mr. Marabh as a bin Laden agent, and Customs agents soon discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would not say how much -- to Mr. Hijazi. On Friday, federal officials froze Mr. Hijazi 's assets, along with those of 20 other individuals and organizations. <p> Officials believe that the two men met in Afghanistan in 1994. In Mr. Hijazi 's statements to intelligence agents, he said Mr. Marabh paved the way for him in Boston, where he took a job at the same cab company. He listed Mr. Marabh as his emergency contact at the company, and in 1998, moved in with Mr. Marab and his wife. Mr. Hijazi told intelligence agents that he used his cab to earn $13,000 that he sent to the Middle East to finance terrorist activities. <p> Whether or not intelligence officials sought Mr. Marabh after they knew of his association with Al Qaeda, he became a moving target. <p> He appeared in Boston in December 2000 to plead guilty to charges in the stabbing, receiving a six-month suspended sentence. But by then, he had already been living in Detroit for several months, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Southwest side. He had received a new driver 's license, and upgraded it to allow him to haul hazardous materials. <p> In a two-story brick duplex where he lived, the police would arrive after the Sept. 11 attacks and find his name still on the mailbox, as well as a drawer full of forged identification and immigration documents, including several using the Social Security number of a Massachusetts man whose wallet had been lost in Boston. <p> They found a day planner that included references to the " American base in Turkey " the " American foreign minister, " " Alia Airport " in Jordan, as well as diagrams of what appeared to be airport flight lines. Investigators believe that the notations may have referred to former Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, who canceled a trip to a base in Turkey last December after learning of a " credible threat " against him. <p> In January, Mr. Marabh moved to Toronto. And while he appeared not to have a job beyond occasional work at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shop suggest that he was dealing in large amounts of money, all of it in United States dollars. In the week before he tried to sneak out of the country, he deposited $10,000 and transferred $15,000 to an American bank. He had made 15 transactions -- records do not say how large -- in the month before that. <p> Investigators now also suspect that Mr. Marabh was using his uncle 's copy shop to forge immigration papers. <p> Yet when he was caught on June 27 carrying forged Canadian citizenship papers, Mr. Marabh insisted that the only thing he had ever done wrong was to skip out on probation in Boston. He was only trying to see his family, he insisted ; he had not seen them in 15 years. <p> The hearing officer at the Niagara Regional Detention Center was reluctant to release him on bail, suspecting that Mr. Marabh might flee the country. " He appears to act in his own best interest as opposed to the interest of the laws of the country in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the officer said. <p> But it would be a near miss. <p> At a second hearing 12 days later, Mr. Marabh 's lawyer persuaded the officer to release his client to an uncle, noting that the uncle was an imam who had preached on, among other topics, " How to Protect Your Family From Satan. " The lawyer did not mention that the uncle also worked at the school headed by Mahmoud Jaballah, who Canadian intelligence officials had long suspected was a member of the terrorist group Al Jihad ; in August, when Mr. Jaballah was jailed on charges of terrorism, the uncle took over as principal. <p> " Previously, Mr. Marabh did not have anybody looking after him, he did not have anybody guiding him in a sense, " the lawyer said. Noting that the uncle had put up $3,000 bail, he added that Mr. Marabh " has a moral interest, as well as a financial interest and a religious interest. It 's his religious duty to carry out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was released on bail in Canada, the Boston police went to Mr. Marabh 's former address with a warrant for his arrest that had been issued in March. His landlord told them Mr. Marabh had not left a forwarding address. <p> On Sept. 13, Canadian police, too, issued a warrant for his arrest, after he skipped bail. About that time, United States officials put him on the list of suspects and associates in connection with the Sept. 11 attacks. <p> But as usual, Mr. Marabh was one step ahead of the authorities. He had been back in Detroit since Aug. 7, when he applied for a duplicate driver 's license. On Sept. 17, when the F.B.I. went to the address on that license, he was in Michigan, not far from Chicago, getting another. <p> He had moved to suburban Chicago, first living with another uncle in Justice, and then moving to Hickory Hills. Walid A. Beitouni, an owner of 7 Days, a quickie market and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared at his store in late August to help the uncle install security cameras. He returned often to buy a slushy drink called Parrot-Ice, and when a cashier failed to show up for work one night in early September, Mr. Beitouni said, he hired Mr. Marabh for the late shift. <p> After Mr. Marabh 's name hit newspapers as a suspect, a personal injury lawyer he had hired after his cab was hit in Boston phoned the F.B.I. and said that he had a forwarding address outside of Chicago. <p> Late on Wednesday, Sept. 19, Mr. Marabh 's uncle showed up at the store to tell his nephew his face was on television and that he was wanted by the F.B.I. <p> Mr. Marabh seemed to know what it was about. " He said ' I do n't want to get you involved, ' " Mr. Beitouni recalled. " He said ' I 'm going to go and call these people in New York in the morning. ' I said, ' You better call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes, the F.B.I. arrived in bulletproof vests, guns drawn, and finally took Mr. Marabh away. <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
