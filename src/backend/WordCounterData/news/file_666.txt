4188441 changed for Chris Kreider, but it appears as though the 25-year-old power winger 's mindset has changed in his approach to the upcoming 2016-17 season. <p> " Nothing changes from what I should have been doing last year and what I will be doing this year, " Kreider said Wednesday at the club 's practice rink after helping out on the ice at the Rangers Youth Hockey Camp. " It 's being big, strong, fast, mean, imposing and getting to the net and playing a power forward 's game -- north-south. <p> " I know the player I want to be going forward so I can try to have an impact on a nightly basis. " <p> Somehow, though, the objective has often gotten lost in translation as Kreider, notorious for internalizing, has been prone to overthinking matters. That tendency undermined his game through the opening months of last season to the extent he told The Post on Nov. 28, " I do n't think things could have gone more poorly. " <p> " I think there was a lot that probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not be going your way and you have those expectations to produce, " Kreider said Wednesday. " You can be playing well with the puck not going in, and the next thing you know, you 're not playing well and the puck 's not going in. " <p> Kreider finished in a rush, getting five goals in six games before going scoreless in the final two to match his career best of 21 goals set the previous season -- and that was without converting on a breakaway until March 26 in Montreal in Game 75 of the season. <p> Kreider 's inability to break out on the score sheet was secondary to his failure to play with authority on a consistent basis. There were too many nights when you did n't see Kreider on the ice, let alone the score sheet. There is no doubt he recognizes that. <p> " I 've looked at my last year, I 've gone over it, and I 've moved beyond it, " Kreider said. " But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in retrospect, I probably spread myself too thin and got away from the player I know I am. " <p> The amateur psychiatrists in the room theorize Kreider stopped crashing the net because of the spotlight placed on him in the aftermath of the infamous Carey Price incident in Game 1 of the 2014 conference finals in which he skidded into and injured the Montreal goaltender on a breakaway after his skate was clipped by chasing defenseman Alexei Emelin. <p> Now, though, Kreider -- an effective net presence on the power play who was on for 16 of the club 's 20 power-play goals after Christmas -- is vowing to be relentless driving to the net off the rush and getting in on the forecheck. <p> " I should n't be carrying the puck through the neutral zone. I should be in the corner bearing down on the defense, " he said. " And if I 'm carrying the puck, I should be going straight to the net or straight at the defense. <p> " It 's about moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's defense, making them turn and winning those battles. " <p> Not to quibble, but Kreider should be carrying the puck down the left side off outlet passes, using his speed to create separation and back in the defense in order to create space in which to launch drives from the circle. He has the ability to be that kind of a scoot-and-shoot player, too. <p> " It 's about simplifying my game and relying on the physical attributes I know I have, " said the 6-foot-3, 226-pound specimen, who has split his time between New York and his Boston digs this summer. " I do n't have specific goals, but I do have a mission to perform every single day. " <p> The Rangers confirmed Maxim Lapierre, who played last year in Switzerland and Sweden, will attend training camp on a tryout. Perhaps the 31-year-old center, who played three seasons for coach Alain Vigneault in Vancouver from late in the 2010-11 season through 2012-13, is an extra body to have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zuccarello are otherwise occupied with the World Cup. Lapierre was a decent faceoff man in his heyday, which included stops in Montreal, Anaheim, St. Louis and Pittsburgh.
