4136441 Zack Sheridan has returned to his alma mater to coach a sport he almost walked away from. Sheridan, a 2009 graduate and four-year starter at Mount Pleasant Area High School, took a year off from wrestling when he attended IUP. " I quickly found that I had made a mistake, " said Sheridan, who transferred to Elizabethtown College after one year at IUP. " I realized that wrestling would be a part of my life for the rest of my life. " Sheridan was a three-year starter at Elizabethtown College and graduated with a degree in early childhood education. " I volunteered at a couple high schools while I was in college, " said Sheridan, who is now working as a health and physical education teacher at Albert Gallatin. " My goal was to become a wrestling coach when I graduated. " Sheridan could n't believe his luck when hearing that Mount Pleasant 's coach, Mike Long, had stepped down. " I was so excited when I heard about the opening at Mount Pleasant, " said Sheridan, who wasted no time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job, I asked my former teammate, Paul Snyder, to be my assistant. We 're both looking forward to the season. " Sheridan is familiar with the program, as he served as a junior high assistant coach last year. " We have 12 kids on the varsity team and 10 on the junior high team, so the numbers are not where we want them to be, " Sheridan said. " But we are very optimistic about the kids we do have. We have five seniors who should provide a lot of leadership. " Mount Pleasant fell short of a postseason berth last season after tying for third place in sub-section 2B. The Vikings have four returnees who qualified for the Southwest Regional last season, Mike Novak( 20-7 at 126), Austin Mears( 28-11 at 145), Ethan Charlesworth( 32-12 at 160) and Josh Lind( 31-13 at 220). Burrell team to beat Burrell is once again the team to beat in WPIAL Class AA. The Buccaneers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match the past 12 years. Coach Josh Shields has some rebuilding to do, however, as six starters have graduated, including three PIAA qualifiers. " We have a very young team, " Shields said. " We usually have multiple state qualifiers back. That is not the case this year. We have only one state qualifier returning. " Shields is referring to Allan Beattie( 46-6 at 285), a senior who won WPIAL and Southwest Region titles and placed third in the state last season. " Allan is one of the best heavyweights in the state, " Shields said. Other top returnees for Burrell are Anthony Marra( 28-18 at 126), Damon Greenwald( 15-12 at 138) and Robert Scherer( 32-19 at 195). Section 2 contenders Derry and Yough are two teams to watch in sub-section 2B. Derry must replace five starters who graduated from a squad that placed second in Section 2. " We are very young, " Derry coach Mike Weinell said. " But our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first in the section, if we can fill a lineup. " Derry has 18 wrestlers on its roster. The top returnees are Cole Wano( 20-11 at 113), George Phillippi( 42-5 at 120) and Stone Kepple( 34-14 at 126). Phillippi is a two-time PIAA place-winner and one-time champ. Yough lost four starters who graduated from a squad that finished second in sub-section 2B and fourth in the section. The Cougars have also three wrestlers who are most likely out for the season with injuries, Jason Strange( 20-4 at 138), John Paul Sommers( 13-20 at 145) and Clayton Waldron( 26-16 at 182). " We 've certainly been hit by the injury bug, " Yough coach Bill Zollner said. " But as Steelers coach Mike Tomlin says, ' The next guy has to be ready to step in. ' " Zollner 's top returnees are Zack Charles( 20-17 at 113) and Thomas Sever( 35-11 at 220). " We have 20 kids, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said. " We have to put the effort in, or it will be a long season.
