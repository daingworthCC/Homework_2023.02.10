Coupons generally offer the best savings when used for coast-to-coast or other long-distance domestic flights. Senior Select Savings Plus provides solid discounts on shorter flights, and first-class tickets also can be purchased at a big discount. <p> Meanwhile, seniors can reap a 10 percent saving on the cost of coupon booklets -- at least temporarily. The 10 percent federal tax on airfares expired at year 's end, and until Congress acts to impose it again, seniors who shop around can save about $ 50 on the price of each booklet. Several airlines -- including Northwest, TWA, United and USAir -- began quoting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as late as last week, others still were charging the higher tax-inclusive rate. <p> But seniors do n't have to enroll in Delta 's new program or purchase coupon booklets to get an airfare discount. Most airlines award seniors a 10 percent break on any ticket simply for the asking ; the discount is available on most international as well as domestic flights. During an airfare war, you may get the cheapest fare by taking advantage of this offer. Be aware, however, that some airlines do not grant the senior discount on their cheapest promotional fares. <p> Deciding which discount program is best for you can be confusing. Here 's a look at the advantages and disadvantages of the different offers. <p> The Delta Senior Select Savings Plus program prices tickets for seniors based on travel within or between seven U.S. zones, including Alaska and Hawaii. Participants must enroll in advance and pay a $ 40 annual membership fee. <p> When it unveiled the program late last year, Delta announced that participants could expect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance-purchase fares in coach class and 50 percent off first-class fares. " Discount coupon booklets could become obsolete for senior travelers, " a Delta press release predicted. <p> How do these fares compare with the savings a senior could get by purchasing a Delta " Young at Heart " coupon booklet? <p> Delta has been charging $ 596( federal tax included) for a booklet of four coupons -- each good for a one-way flight anywhere in the country. Using two coupons for a round trip within Zone 2, a traveler would pay $ 298( one half of $ 596) compared with $ 198 in the Senior Select Savings Plus program -- a saving of $ 100. Obviously the new program is the winner here. <p> But the savings disappear on transcontinental travel. With two coupons, a flight between Washington( Zone 2) and San Francisco( Zone 6) would also cost just $ 298. This is the same price that a participant in the Senior Select Savings Plus program would pay for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this instance, coupons appear to be the winner. <p> In a further comparison, Delta this month has been quoting a standard( available to everyone) round-trip fare in coach class of $ 358 between Washington and San Francisco. This is more than seniors participating in either of the two Delta programs would have had to pay. <p> Now for the particulars. Annual enrollment in Senior Select Savings Program is $ 40 for one person. But members can enroll up to three other people age 62 or older( a spouse, for example) or ages 2 to 12( grandchildren). A membership for two is $ 65 and for three or four, it is $ 70. All participants must join Delta 's SkyMiles frequent-flier program. Enrollment currently is scheduled to close on April 1, or sooner if the program 's limited membership goal is reached. Delta says it has restricted the number of charter memberships to make sure participants have ready access to the discounted fares. <p> Any number of trips can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed by April 1, 1998. <p> Participants must purchase tickets 14 days in advance -- which is one disadvantage to the program. Coupon holders usually can fly on a standby basis on the next plane out. Being able to get a seat at the last minute is an important consideration if you anticipate flights to a funeral or the sickbed of a loved one. <p> On the plus side, seniors may find it easier in the Senior Select program to pay for trips one at a time rather than buying a booklet, which is the equivalent of paying for two round trips at the same time. A one-way fare is $ 10 more than half the round-trip fare. To enroll, call( 800) 325-3750. <p> Senior airfare coupon booklets : All the major airlines sell these coupon booklets, but the price varies -- as do the restrictions limiting their use. With most airlines, the booklets contain four coupons, each good for a one-way flight. But Continental and TWA offer booklets with eight coupons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 62, so I have not used coupons. But I have given them as a well-received gift to my mother, a frequent traveler. <p> Sometimes seniors can buy cheaper tickets during an airfare war. But to take advantage of a fare war, you have to keep alert to the sales, buy quickly before the cheap seats are sold out and travel during specified time periods. By buying booklets you can fly on a discount at any time and you spare yourself the hassle of keeping track of the ups and downs of ticket prices. And you already have the discount if an emergency requires an immediate trip. <p> When purchasing coupons, it is important to select a carrier that flies to the destinations that interest you. Remember, you are committing yourself to a minimum of two round trips, which must be taken within a year of the coupon purchase. Generally, refunds are available only if none of the coupons is used. <p> Because the 10 percent federal tax on domestic airfares expired Dec. 31 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be USAirways) have cut the price of their coupon booklets by about $ 50. It is uncertain when or in what form the tax will be reimposed -- maybe not for several weeks. Meanwhile, coupons are an even better bargain. <p> When choosing between booklets, ask about blackout periods and fees for changing flight dates once you have exchanged a coupon for a ticket. Continental limits the use of coupons during holiday periods, and some airlines assess a flight-change fee of $ 25 or $ 50. Also check on whether you can buy a coupon booklet for a traveling companion under the age of 62 ; TWA is one airline that sells them. Also check on destinations. Some airlines permit you to fly to Canada, Mexico, Bermuda and the Caribbean using coupons. Airlines serving Hawaii and Alaska require four coupons -- a full booklet -- rather than two for a round trip. <p> Typically, coupon holders must book a flight 14 days in advance. But airlines allow them to fly on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's an empty seat on the plane, you get it ; if not, you wait for the next departure and try again. On flights expected to be full, the airlines may limit the number of seats available to coupon holders. <p> Continental Freedom and Global Passports are special Continental programs for seniors who fly frequently. <p> The Freedom Passport allows a single one-way domestic trip per week( excluding travel on Thursday afternoon, Friday and Sunday), and there are other significant restrictions. The price is $ 999( with the federal tax) for four months, and $ 1,999 in coach class and $ 3,499 in first class for 12 months. <p> The Global Passport, good for 12 months, covers the 50 U.S. states as well as Continental 's flights to Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America and Europe. Restrictions vary according to destination, so check ahead. <p> The tax-included price is $ 4,499 for coach class and $ 6,999 for first class. <p> For more information about either program @ @ @ @ @ @
