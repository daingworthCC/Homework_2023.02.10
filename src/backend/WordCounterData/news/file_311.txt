3052841 <p> MARIAN Anderson -- a reluctant symbol of America 's struggle for civil rights -- is now gone from the stage of human events. But before we move on, it is important, I believe, that Americans take at least one more moment to consider this woman. <p> When she died last Thursday at age 96 in Portland, Ore., Anderson had been known as one of the world 's greatest singers of opera music. But her life was about still greater things, such as self-determination, resilience and the struggle for perfection. Her successes breathed new life into black America at a time when it desperately needed resurrecting. <p> When Anderson was growing up, the country had a " " Birth of a Nation " mentality. White America thought blacks had no culture. <p> America 's image of black people was firmly in the minstrel tradition. The popular notions ranged from that of the shiftless, lazy servant to passive mammies to sassy Sapphires to sex machines. <p> Anderson grew up believing that individual personal achievement was the best way to help change this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those stereotypes. <p> I 'm not an opera lover, but I know the great Paul Robeson was Anderson 's contemporary. And I was startled that her autobiography did not mention his influence on her. She was not interested in politics as was Robeson, who was making history as a singer, actor, scholar and an activist. <p> My aunt, who loved Robeson, assured me that he and Anderson were great friends. It 's just that, in Anderson 's words, she was not passive in these matters, she just was not as aggressive. She was an artist. <p> When I was growing up, Anderson was enjoying her retirement. <p> For my generation, in the ' 60s and ' 70s, music was Jimi Hendrix, John Coltrane and Miles Davis. My mother could stomach the Supremes and the Temptations, but it was she who turned my sisters and me on to Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan and Ella Fitzgerald. Mahalia Jackson made her cry. But no one could make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I, too, was captivated. <p> I 'm still no opera lover -- but that voice... The force of that voice was something else. It soothed and caressed, but it haunted, and it seemed to have limitless power. Someone said that upon hearing Barbara Jordan address the Democratic National Convention recently, they thought they were hearing the voice of God. These folks apparently never heard Marian Anderson. That deep, passionate voice had to be like the voice Moses heard on that mountain. <p> That vast, magnificent voice would have been enough for me to be in awe of her talent, but my mother told me more. My mother shared with me what a great role model Anderson was ; how she had had an ordinary upbringing -- for a black child -- how she had been denied entrance to a music school because of her race( her response : " " My skin was different, not my feelings. ") ; how even after worldwide success, custodians of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But, my mother stressed, Anderson persevered. She was undeterred. <p> Her struggles to develop a career were much the same as any other would-be classical musician, with the additional burden of racism. <p> America was a place of racial segregation and she faced those special challenges throughout her career. My mother pointed out that Anderson never publicly complained about discriminatory treatment. Some may see an imbalance in the endurance of suffering as opposed to confronting injustice. To my mother, Anderson did n't surrender. She decided to bear the burden of racism with grace. Passive resistance, if you will. <p> And the pressures were tremendous for Anderson. Consider when she grew up -- the 1920s and ' 30s... post-Reconstruction, the Great Migration, poverty, discrimination -- sure. But it was also the time of talk of racial pride and cultural nationalism : of Marcus Garvey 's Back to Africa movement ; of Carter G. Woodson, A. Philip Randolph, of W.E.B. DuBois, Walter White and the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the time of the Harlem Renaissance : writers Arna Bontemps, Sterling Brown, Countee Cullen, Robert Hayden, Langston Hughes, James Weldon Johnson, Claude McKay ; film maker Oscar Micheaux ; musicians Eubie Blake and Duke Ellington ; the Cotton Club. <p> Anderson had sophisticated tastes. She did n't resign herself to domestic or factory work. Her dreams were high-class. <p> And black Americans were starving for symbols. Joe Louis and Jesse Owens captured the imaginations of white America, but to black America she meant much more. <p> What historians can never forget is that in 1939, after the Daughters of the American Revolution had decided not to allow Anderson to sing at Washington 's Constitution Hall, first lady Eleanor Roosevelt protested and then resigned from the organization. Mrs. Roosevelt helped arrange for the now-famous concert to be held on Easter Sunday at the Lincoln Memorial. The crowd of 75,000 that turned out showed that some white Americans, were willing to take a stand against racial discrimination and put forth the proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens. It was deemed the largest manifestation of public support for civil rights until the 1963 March on Washington. <p> Anderson admitted that she was a reluctant symbol of that public debate. And it was much more controversial then than it was in 1963. It was not a role that she chose. In fact, she was n't sure that she should accept the offer to sing at the Lincoln Memorial, as she said later, " " I could see that my significance as an individual was small in this affair. I had become, whether I liked it or not, a symbol representing my people. I had to appear. " And she handled it with grace. <p> And you can bet young black women and little black girls were watching : Maya Angelou, Lorraine Hansberry, Toni Morrison, Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks... <p> And black America followed her achievements closely, inheriting a sense of pride, responsibility and determination ; a sense of the exhilaration of challenge, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concert, Anderson could have used her new visibility and her voice to further that struggle. She did begin to insist that blacks in her segregated audiences be offered seats equally as good as seats for whites ; and that blacks not have to wait until whites had first chance at tickets. One of my father-in-law 's fondest recollections is of Anderson performing for the Negro troops in World War II. <p> But she said : " " It would be fooling myself to think that I was meant to be a fearless fighter ; I was not. Just as I was not meant to be a soprano instead of a contralto. " She was comfortable most when singing. She did not want to be a spokesperson for her race, she wanted to be an example of how the black race had progressed culturally and artistically. <p> Marian Anderson was a role model for black women : dignified, sophisticated... too proud to bend, too strong to break -- she was a stable symbol of black womanhood. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deeply spiritual person. That 's what my mother liked most -- that she sang spirituals in her recitals. Anderson opened the world of operas to see the classic qualities of gospel music. <p> Anderson has said that she did n't deserve the credit for opening doors ; that those who came after her achieved their status on their own merits. It is our good fortune that Marian Anderson discovered she had the courage and the discipline to continue and eventually break down cultural barriers. <p> TYPE : Editorial Opinion <p> NOTES : Metz is a Chronicle copy editor.
