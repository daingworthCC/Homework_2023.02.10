4189841 <h> More Articles <p> For those clamoring for a radical change to the way Ohio funds traditional and charter schools, the chairman of the House Education Committee has a plan. <p> How about no more voting on local property taxes? No more local bond issues to build schools. Regional transportation systems instead of one for every district. Open enrollment -- everywhere -- meaning any student can attend any district of his or her choice. <p> The state would completely take over school funding, largely through a statewide property tax that could mean big changes to funding amounts for schools and taxes paid by property owners. <p> Most Franklin County homeowners, for example, would see property tax reductions ranging from 13 percent to 34 percent if the plan were in place this year, according to a Legislative Service Commission analysis of the proposal provided to The Dispatch by a local school official. <p> At the same time, seven county districts would see funding cuts ranging from 11 percent to 41 percent, with no ability to raise local money to make up the losses. <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school-funding system would be, " said Rep. Andrew Brenner, R-Powell, who purposely introduced the plan after the final day of the lame-duck session. He also said he has no plans to put it in next year 's two-year budget. <p> He said he wants to start a conversation that includes the new Joint Education Oversight Committee, and before moving forward he 'd want buy-in from lawmakers across the state. <p> " We have not really had this conversation in the state about an alternative school-funding system, " Brenner said. " We 've complained about it. A lot of people say, ' Let 's have a different school funding system, this one is n't constitutional. ' OK, let 's have that conversation. " <p> The bill would eliminate all local levies and school income taxes and replace them with a statewide property tax of 38.6 mills. Schools would not be permitted to pass additional local taxes. <p> Essentially, if your school district 's current total effective millage, plus any income tax revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tax cut. <p> Funding would be handed out on a flat per-pupil amount of $8,740, plus additional money for categories such as students with special needs or who are economically disadvantaged. That money would be paid to whatever school the student chooses to attend. <p> " If you have the full amount of money following the student, the check and balance becomes the parent, " Brenner said. " If they are in a low-performing school and it 's not making the right changes, they move the kid and the full( amount) follows the student. So if I 'm running that school, I probably want to make better decisions to retain that student. " <p> Under the plan, charter schools would see an estimated 22 percent funding increase, or about $217 million, while joint vocational schools would lose nearly 17 percent. <p> The state also would take over all school district construction debt, currently about $993 million, and revamp how the state pays for future construction projects. Consolidating the debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Analysis of Legislative Service Commission data showed that, for example, Worthington residents would see a 29 percent property tax cut, but the district would lose nearly 24 percent of its total funding for operations, about $29 million. Columbus property taxes would drop about 17 percent, while funding for the district would drop more than 4 percent. <p> Taxes would go down in every Franklin County district except one -- Hamilton Local, the county 's only rural district, where taxes would jump 23 percent and district funding would increase nearly 15 percent. <p> School funding would increase 10 percent in Whitehall and 2 percent in South-Western, but would remain flat or reduced in other county districts. <p> In Olentangy Local, Brenner 's home district, residents would see an 18.5 percent decrease in taxes, and the district would get a 16 percent funding increase, about $25 million. The district 's population growth has required multiple bond issues and operating levies over the past 15 years, and those living on fixed income ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that when he reintroduces the bill next year, he may include sales and income tax revenue to fund the plan, lowering the necessary property tax millage. <p> The bill as introduced also would mean a huge financial windfall for private schools -- an estimated 213 percent funding increase, or just over $1 billion. The Commission said the actual figure is probably even higher. <p> But Brenner, citing cost, said he expects private schools will not be included when the bill is reintroduced next year. <p> If private schools were not included, the Commission estimates that traditional school operating funds would see an overall increase this year of 3.2 percent, or about $517 million. The impact on individual districts would vary widely. <p> Rep. Ryan Smith, R-Bidwell, chairman of the House Finance Committee and an advocate for rural district funding, did n't have much to say about the plan, but noted, " It has a lot of sharp edges, I 'll tell you that. " <p> Ohio 's system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be complicated, said Barbara Shaner, associate executive director of the Ohio Association of Business Officials. <p> " I 'm sure he has good intentions, but from what we can tell, there would be some major changes that some districts would not be able to manage. " <p> Plus, she said, the hundreds of districts that have already spent millions paying off school buildings likely wo n't be happy if the state suddenly decides to handle the remaining debt for everyone else. <p> A statewide property tax was floated 15 years ago, though that 20-mill tax still would have allowed local districts to raise additional money. The idea went nowhere.
