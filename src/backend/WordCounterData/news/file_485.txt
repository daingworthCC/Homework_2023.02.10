4086741 Kristin Scott Thomas is well known in the English-speaking world for her work in films such as " The English Patient " and " Four Weddings and a Funeral. " But what 's less known - what 's virtually unknown - is that from the beginning, and especially recently, Thomas has been making movies in France. # This French resume constitutes roughly half of her career. We got a sampling of this work a couple of years ago, when she played a newly released ex-convict in " I 've Loved You So Long. " It was one of the signature performances of the decade. # The Thomas that we find in her French films is different from the Thomas of England and America. In her English-language films, she is usually prim, proper, reserved and often cold. In her French films, she is free-spirited, sometimes insouciant, usually glamorous and often frankly sexual. # And though it might be too extreme to say that Thomas French and English incarnations are like two completely different women, it 's certainly true that, until you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this actress full range and power. # A good place to start - or to continue - your Thomas education is with " Leaving " known in France as " Partir ", about a doctor 's wife who throws off her staid life and plunges into a mad affair with a Spanish builder. It opens Friday. # Thomas spoke by phone from her home in Paris. # # Well, it 's a bit of a no-brainer, really, because there are such great roles that I keep getting offered in France. If I were offered them in England, I 'd work in England more, but I 'm not. French cinema seems to make these fantastic stories about women in my age group, women that are dynamic, and are going forward and carrying on being alive and not just sitting back watching everything go on around them. They 're stories about women, not about what those women once were. The roles I 'm offered are better. I 'm sure American cinema has some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't come my way. It might have something to do with refusing to go to Los Angeles - it might have something to do with lurking in Paris. # # I learned at school, and then I started going to France on exchange. And I 've been living in France for 30 years - when I left home, I moved to Paris, and that was that. # # I do n't know. People need somebody to be the evil aunt, and that 's who I have to be, I guess. And for some reason in France they do n't want me to do it. I think French society and French culture embraces older women, and it 's certainly able to accept that older women have appeal - I mean sexual appeal as well as other kinds of appeal. It does n't have to be naughty-naughty wink-wink, it can also be quite serious - stories about the psyche - somebody 's character, and it can be about a woman 's situation that maybe does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about desire, about somebody waking up in her late forties or mid-forties and thinking, " Hang on a minute, I 've missed something. " It happens to a lot of people, what we label rather disparagingly as " mid-life crises. " # What I think is great about the film is that she goes to somebody who is n't a sort of rippling, muscled, buffed-up, gorgeous tanned hunk. She goes for a proper man played by Sergi Lpez, a real man, someone with a bit of a beer belly, all those things. She goes for somebody - not a typical love interest type person. # Anyway, I do get a little but frustrated by the English - they have a kind of thing about looking backward, reminiscing over one 's lost youth. There 's an English Puritanical thing going on. I mean, look how outr everybody is about Helen Mirren. They say, " My God, she 's still sexy, and she 's 60-something. " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a woman. You just either reflect that kind of stuff with other people, or you do n't. In England they do n't want to see me doing that for some reason. # # Oh, yeah, completely. That 's why I 'm so drawn to these French things, because they give me so much freedom as an actress. I think it 's probably to do with the fact that the first roles I played in England were as aristocrats, and I happened to nail it, so they want you to reproduce that forever and ever. And then " The English Patient " - that pushed the nail in even further, and I got stuck like that. I just got so fed up with it. Every time some titled seductress appeared, I would be her. And now it 's not a titled seductress, but a kind of titled ex-seductress. I just do n't really feel the need to do those parts, because I 'm getting far more interesting parts in France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd be crazy. # # Not at all. No, actually, I came from quite a difficult background. I was the eldest daughter of a Royal Navy pilot who was killed at the age of 30. And then my mother married again, to another naval pilot, so we were brought up with the proceeds from his life insurance, which was to provide for one child. So our mother brought us up with enough money for one child, and we had to make do. But it 's amazing how communities will come together. I was privately educated because I was a Catholic growing up in a non-Catholic environment, so the local government would send us to Catholic school, which happened to be a private school. The school that I went to, Cheltenham Ladies College, which is a really high-flying school, I went there virtually scot-free, because they really help people. It was a very Jane Austen-type upbringing, you know, impoverished gentility, but nothing aristocratic and nothing wealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't matter. The only thing I would say is when you are making a film about desire, which we are in " Leaving, " it really did help to have all these women around me, because it gave me confidence, and it made me feel unthreatened, and it made me feel it was a group effort. So that changed, and it possibly would n't be the same working with a male director, but other than that, it 's all the same. # # I 've never managed to do that. I hate paperwork, and the whole idea of another 10 forms to fill out, I just could n't bear it, but I 'm going to have to do it soon, because there 's going to be a general election, and I 'm going to have to get my act together. sbox # not rated opens
