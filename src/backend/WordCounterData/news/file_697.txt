4191541 <p> Gio Gonzalez held the Indians to three runs( two earned) in Cleveland a couple weeks ago.( AP Photo/Ron Schwane) <p> The Washington Nationals( 66-45) are peaking. After posting their worst month of the season in July -- a 13-12 mark -- they 've gone 5-1 in August and are up to a season-high 21 games over.500 with a season-high 7 1/2-game lead in the National League East. Their eight-game homestand, which began by taking two of three from the Giants over the weekend, continues Tuesday with a brief two-game series against the first-place Indians( 62-47), two weeks removed from the teams splitting a pair of meetings in Cleveland. <p> BRYCE HARPER 'S STATUS <p> Bryce Harper exited Saturday 's loss to the Giants in the sixth inning because of a stiff neck and did n't play in Sunday 's 1-0 victory. After the game, Nationals Manager Dusty Baker explained he gave Harper the day off because the respite would essentially give Harper three days to rest following Washington 's idle Monday. Baker said he expected Harper to play Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frustrating season for Harper, who has scuffled nearly the entire campaign. Since May 1, he 's slashing.219/.365/.362 in 353 plate appearances. His.365 on-base percentage -- buoyed by his still elite walk rate -- is nothing to scoff at, but he is not punishing pitches in the strike zone anywhere close to the level he did last season. <p> Replicating his 2015 MVP season was unlikely -- it was perhaps the best year for a hitter since Barry Bonds 's heyday -- but the tumble has been glaringly steep. Harper, however, was hitting the ball hard before he struck out three times with the neck discomfort Saturday -- perhaps a sign that he is coming into his own. <p> CAN GIO CONTINUE HIS THIRD CHAPTER? <p> Gio Gonzalez 's season has, so far, been one of three chapters. The first -- April 12 through May 18 -- lasted eight starts. In that span, the left-hander posted a 1.86 ERA and held hitters to a.566 on-base-plus-slugging percentage. The second -- May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. During the stretch, he recorded an 8.10 ERA and opponents amassed a.905 OPS. <p> The third -- July 5 through TBD -- is six outings in as of Aug. 5 and resembles the first. Over the month, he compiled a 2.43 ERA and held batters to a.643 OPS. It is the Gonzalez the Nationals need to solidify the back end of the rotation when Joe Ross 's absence -- and uncertain return -- reopens the fifth spot once they begin a stretch of 20 straight games without a day off Friday. <p> Gonzalez limited the Indians to three runs( two earned) across 6? innings in Cleveland on July 26. He is the probable starter opposite Josh Tomlin Wednesday. Max Scherzer and his 1.83 ERA since June 1 will take the mound against Trevor Bauer in Tuesday 's series opener. <p> DRAMA-FREE NINTHS <p> When these teams met in Cleveland a couple weeks ago, the beginning of the end of Jonathan Papelbon 's reign as Nationals closer was underway. In the series opener, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-run lead. Five batters later, he left with the game tied, the bases loaded, and zero outs, though a throwing error by Ryan Zimmerman and a pop-up bunt in no man 's land did n't help. <p> Two nights later, Papelbon made his final appearance as Washington 's closer in San Francisco and was pulled after facing three batters. Now the Nationals have Mark Melancon in the role and the ninth inning is no longer a cardiovascular stress test. On Sunday, Baker complimented Melancon for taking care of the ninth inning " without any drama or anything. " Melancon 's thrown four scoreless innings in a Nationals uniform. So far, no drama. <p> The Indians also shored up their iffy bullpen at the trade deadline by shipping prospects to the Yankees for Andrew Miller. The tall left-hander has made three appearances for Cleveland and is not limited to closing ; Miller has thrown a pitch in the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth innings as an Indian. <p> sports <p> nationals-journal <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox as it happens. <p> Comments our editors find particularly useful or relevant are displayed in Top Comments, as are comments by users with these badges :.
