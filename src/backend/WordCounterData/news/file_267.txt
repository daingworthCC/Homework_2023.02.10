3047841 <p> ' A WORLD RIPE FOR HARVEST ' <p> Editor -- Never ceases to amaze me how armchair fascists such as William( The Conqueror) Heller and Gene Booth( Letters, June 13) bloom so especially well in periods of economic wane. <p> Under the influence of the messiahs for whom they so patriotically serve, in their eyes the world is merely ripe fruit to be harvested, sold, gobbled and excreted. <p> Their sense of history germinates upon declaration, and not beforehand, when the weeds of greed entangle among native seeds. Imperialism, like weeds, has for some 2,000 years persisted, both perennially and immutable. Only the tall lessons in its wake fall deciduous. <p> PETE RHODE <p> Antioch <p>. <p> DITHERING SAVES LIVES <p> Editor -- The author of your June 14 editorial accusing President Clinton of " dithering " over foreign policy ought to reread Arthur Hoppe 's old columns in praise of wimps. Whatever their shortcomings, they seldom kill anybody. <p> Thanks to Clinton 's dithering, fewer people have died as a result of U.S. intervention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carter. The activism of our other recent leaders cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in Guatemala, Indochina, Angola, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Grenada, Panama and Iraq, and the inhabitants of those countries are still suffering the consequences. <p> As for the " fearsome crisis " posed by North Korea, it 's hard to see how one of the poorest countries in the world poses a threat either to the U.S. or its neighbors. According to many Asian scholars, what North Korea dictator Kim II Sung wants is not to invite his country 's annihilation by attacking South Korea, but trade concessions and above all " respect " from the U.S. Clinton has so far wisely refrained from forcing Kim into a corner and leaving him no room for a graceful exit. Surely, as the world 's greatest power we can afford to consult with our allies and negotiate indefinitely if need be, rather than take " decisive action " that might feel good but have disastrous consequences. <p> RACHELLE MARSHALL <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Excuse me, Gene Booth( Letters, June 13), but you 're the one who does n't get it! Oliver North, like every U.S. Marine, swore to defend to the death the Constitution. There was nothing in the oath about obeying any commanding officer, president or otherwise. Is it " true military tradition " to flagrantly violate one 's solemn oath? <p> And while we 're on the subject -- on taking office, Ronald Reagan also swore to defend and uphold the Constitution. Was it patriotic for him to break his promise to the American people? <p> If that 's your idea of patriotism, just exactly what, in your view, does one have to do to be a traitor? <p> WAYNE SMITH <p> San Francisco <p>. <p> FIRST, WOMEN 'S RIGHTS <p> Editor -- In " Lifestyle Worries Prompt New Fear of Overpopulation "( Chronicle, June 9), Mr. Denis Hayes of the Bullitt Foundation in Seattle states at the end of the article, " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want, but the people who will determine the future are the tens of millions of girls age 12 to 18 around the world. " We disagree.( We wish girls had that much power!) <p> The world 's population in the future depends on the ability of girls and women to have access to education, employment opportunities, reproductive rights and voluntary motherhood. The primary barriers to these rights are those of any age, including Mr. Hayes, who might impregnate any woman. Until we acknowledge that reproduction involves two sexes, as well as the systematic exploitation of women( keeping the vast majority of us poor and imprisoned by our different societies ' low opinion of our sex, which includes the notion that our worth is our womb), we can not seriously address questions of planetary overpopulation. <p> DONNA SCISM <p> KATHERINE GLIMN <p> Berkeley <p>. <p> THE ROAD TO SOCIALISM <p> Editor -- Your May 23 editorial, " Clear the Decks for Health Reform, " demonstrates not only your usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalistic advocacy of socialism to perilous and fraudulent heights. <p> For trumpeting the Clintons ' health bill as urgent and necessary for the public good is fraudulent. You and your staff have not read, let alone understood, the 1,500 pages of crazy, conflicting laws that would change a health system in need of a tune-up to a government- dominated instrument of socialism. To turn over one-seventh of the nation 's GDP to the federal government without letting the people know how much it would cost and who would pay for the added costs and how their lives would be changed is not only deceitful but criminal. <p> There can be only one explanation for such behavior. In your eagerness to support the policies of a weak president, you are not adverse to deliberately deceiving the public. I do n't want to spend my old age creeping down back alleys to buy the medical services of an illegal doctor. As with women, I want privacy and freedom of choice for my medical problems. <p> MICHAEL RADDIE <p> San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your editorial against the SOS petition( June 13) only accentuates the need to open the debate on illegal immigration. California taxpayers have much to learn about the cost of illegal immigration and the intricate legal web immigrant advocates have woven to keep this information from us. <p> Signatories to the SOS petition were livid to learn that government employees are prohibited by law or administrative fiat to ask individuals seeking public services if they are citizens or legal residents. These policies hide the true cost of illegal immigration and absolve the INS from enforcing federal immigration laws. We can stop illegal immigration ; but first, we must untie the fettered hands of our public servants. <p> California can no longer afford to incarcerate, medicate, rehabilitate and educate illegal aliens. <p> Immigration is not a partisan issue, and the debate should be drained of emotion and approached in an objective manner. <p> PATRICK SKAIN <p> Bay Area Coalition <p> for Immigration Reform <p> San Francisco <p>. <p> THE MISSING ' WE ' <p> Editor -- Mike Schwartz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who are we? What kind of society do we aspire to be? ") was right on the money. For me, the key word in his letter was " we. " <p> There is no " we " with our current obsession with cultural diversity and ethnic correctness. San Francisco is a good example of the out-and-out factionalism that is the flip side of the cultural coin. Remember the great Roberta Achtenberg replacement debauch? Her successor on the Board of Supervisors had to be a female, a Latina and a lesbian. How many cultures, ethnic groups and political entities did that eliminate? As long as separate groups continue to compete against each other for the " scarce resources " of power, money and status, there will never be a " we " in this country. <p> Our country has always been diverse, but today the melting pot theory, melting into a national " we, " seems to be financially inadvisable, ethnically incorrect and politically untenable. Working on our national problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I am willing to debate the political issues, but I believe that in such a heterogeneous society as ours, consensus about anything seems too tough to achieve. We seem more occupied in fixing the blame for our troubles than on fixing the problem. <p> YVONNE ALVERS <p> San Francisco <p>. <p> CUTTING RED TAPE <p> Editor -- While it may be true that businesses which come under regulatory scrutiny sometimes run into red tape, your article, especially the headline -- " How State 's Red Tape Wrapped Up One Firm "( June 10) -- missed the mark. It is not regulatory oversight or red tape which is holding up the TeraMeth Industries ' proposed project in Southern California. The appropriateness of this project for this location is to be determined, rightfully so, by local decision-makers. <p> Telling communities, city councils, or county boards of supervisors how to manage their land-use affairs is not the policy of the Department of Toxic Substances Control. Our commitment is to assist them in understanding what regulatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of this commitment is the department 's efforts to establish permit assistance centers in an effort to eliminate red tape. <p> The department supports TeraMeth Industries ' concept for development of technology to produce clean methanol fuel from landfill gasses. Where their projects are to be located, however, will be determined by the local communities with whom they seek to partner. <p> WILLIAM F. SOO HOO, director <p> Dept. of Toxic Substances Control <p> Sacramento
