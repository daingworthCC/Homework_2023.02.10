3070641 <p> Deliveries that could n't wait <p> After a 5 1/2-hour drive through treacherous snow from a rural home southeast of Hudson, a baby just could n't wait five more minutes. That 's how close the ambulance was to reaching Platte Valley Medical Center. <p> " It got kind of hairy at times, " said Weld County paramedic Dawn Braddy. <p> Both the mom and baby are doing fine, she said. <p> " It was a bit unusual, " Braddy said. " You do n't do that every day. " <p> In Fort Collins, a woman in labor had to be taken out of her neighborhood in the bucket of a front-end loader because of the heavy snow, according to 9News. <p> It took firefighters an hour to get her from her apartment on Stover Street to an ambulance. She eventually delivered the baby at the hospital. <p>. <p> One more line to stand in <p> Stranded travelers from Denver International Airport occupied the lobby of the Adam 's Mark hotel Thursday, piling into one more line for the chance at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blank stares were commonplace as about 300 people unloaded from a series of emergency buses from the mired airport. <p> " It really changes your perspective, " said Molly Sanchez. <p> She and her 1 1/2-year-old daughter Omayra were headed to Acapulco, Mexico, where Omayra was to be baptized Sunday. <p> Instead, their plane sat for six hours on the tarmac, and the two slept on the floor Wednesday night at the airport. <p> " You go from thinking about vacation to ' Where am I going to find a place for my child to sleep? " ' Sanchez said. <p>. <p> What snow? <p> A poll asking what people were doing during the storm was posted on Pinecam.com, a U.S. 285 community website. Of 308 votes cast, 87 said they were curled up in front of a fire, 22 were playing in the snow, 32 were " working, dagnabit!, " three were digging vehicles out of ditches, and 31 were surfing Pinecam. <p> Fifty-seven folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> A broom for a shovel 's job <p> Armed with a raggedy broom, 16- year-old Derrick Sims stood on his porch on East 22nd Avenue in Denver Nuggets sweat pants. He waded down the unshoveled stairs and onto the unplowed street and began taking the broom to his green Dodge Neon. His sweats were caked with snow. <p> " I got ta get out to finish my Christmas shopping, " said Sims, a student at Denver 's East High School. " I 've just been sitting in there, and I got ta get out and do it. " <p> Twenty minutes later, the Dodge Neon was still immersed like a little marshmallow. <p>. <p> Blizzard buffet <p> What do people buy at the grocery store in a blizzard? Hamburger meat, Doritos, spaghetti sauce, parmesan cheese, Little Debbies and disposable cameras, apparently. <p> The Safeway store at 20th Avenue and Washington Street in Denver had n't received a truck delivery, and the shelves were looking a little empty. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cameras. The parmesan-cheese section of the store was nearly empty. <p> Fly-fishing instructor Matthew Burkett was buying three pints of Haagen- Dazs and some Red Bull energy drink. " The Red Bull is to give me energy to keep shoveling, " he said. " The ice cream is for when I sit by the fire. " <p> In ample supply in case anyone was concerned : fruits and veggies. <p>. <p> Extra trip for a good cause <p> A north-metro-area woman can thank the Westminster Fire Department " for saving her life " Wednesday night, said Kim LeBlanc, a critical-care nurse. <p> The patient, who was n't identified, was having a heart attack when she was brought to St. Anthony North Hospital in Westminster. But the hospital 's cardiovascular team was at St. Anthony Central in west Denver. <p> An ambulance was n't available, but the Westminster Fire Department rescue crew happened to be at St. Anthony North, having just brought a nurse in to work for her shift. <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anthony Central. <p> " It was out of their area, but they did the right thing, " LeBlanc said. <p>. <p> The hills were alive <p> With a couple of feet of powder and the promise of hot chocolate with the mayor, scores of neighborhood children flocked to the sledding hill at Robinson Park on Thursday to celebrate on a day when business stopped. <p> By shortly after noon, a spontaneous terrain park had been built, and sleds, inner tubes, snowboards and even plastic trash-can lids were employed to ride the gnarly bump runs. <p> Peter Kornefell was at the park with his two children and said he was lucky to be here. He arrived in Denver on one of the last flights to land at DIA on Wednesday morning after a business trip to Tampa, Fla. <p> Scott Robinson was enjoying the snow with his children as well, but he said he was wishing there had been just a wee bit less. <p> " I 'm in the liquor business, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me. It would have been better if there had been a little less snow so people could still get out. " <p> Paula Friedman, Shawn Alfrey and Martha MacCormack all walked to the park with their children hoping to see Mayor John Hickenlooper and take him up on his offer of hot chocolate. <p> After about an hour of strenuous sledding, it was after 3 p.m., and with no sign of the mayor, even the hardiest of the bunch were running out of steam. <p> " The mayor lied, " said Jacob Friedman to his mom. <p> Then he spun around, leaped onto his sled and hurtled down the hill one more time. <p>. <p> Blizzard burglars <p> Burglars used the cover of the blizzard to clean out the Game Trader in Brighton, according to the store 's owner, Nathan Keller. <p> Thieves smashed the windows of the business Wednesday night, taking video games and merchandise such as Xboxes, PSPs and Wiis. Cash was also stolen, Keller said. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were too busy handling emergency calls to investigate the incident. <p> " I think they were professional thieves, " Keller said. " What better time to do a burglary? The police were out in the blizzard. It 's like the looting that happened during the blackouts and Hurricane Katrina. " <p> Brighton police could not be reached for comment about the burglary Thursday afternoon. <p> Keller had opened his store hours before the burglary to help stranded motorists who could not return to the roads. <p> Keller says police told him to come to the station and file a report on the burglary. <p>. <p> Room at the church <p> A Lutheran pastor in Aspen on Thursday night opened his church to snow-dodging concert-goers seeking a tropical respite in the mountains. <p> Because the blizzard forced many fans of Freddy and the Fishsticks - the alter ego of beachcombing country-rocker Jimmy Buffett - to travel early for a sold-out show Friday night, Matt Switzer offered fellow " parrot heads " a night of shelter at Messiah Lutheran Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening my place to a bunch of strangers, but for those folks trying to find a hotel room in Aspen on Christmas weekend, and it being a blizzard even for Colorado, " he said. " Well, it seemed appropriate for me as a pastor to open up the stable, so to speak. " <p>. <p> Slow work, busy home <p> Vehicles abandoned by drivers during the blizzard lay about some central streets like toys in a playroom - forcing ski commuters to break stride. <p> Digging around one of the cars, Denver Health and Hospitals emergency- room night-shift nurse Kathy Erickson, 32, wanted to get some sleep. No major action in the ER, she said - it was " very slow " through the night with " just minor injuries. " <p> Now Erickson 's black four-wheel- drive Honda lay crosswise, rear jutting into her street where she had tried to park outside her house. As she dug, an elderly man with his chin resting just atop his steering wheel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicking up a rooster tail of snow, trying to blow through drifts. <p> She cringed as he whooshed past. <p> " I 'm going to bed, if I can just park my car, " she said. " Sleep until 12. " <p>. <p> Ambassador snowman <p> In a parking lot behind an apartment building near Rose Medical Center, a group of friends from India and Japan threw big handfuls of snow at one another and built snowmen for the first time ever. <p> Masako Terada gave her sunglasses and brown derby to the little snowman she and her friends made. Someone else donated brown gloves with furry trim. <p> " I have never had such a heavy snow, so it 's a little confusing and a lot of fun, " said Terada, who just graduated from the International Language Center at the Auraria Campus. The ceremony, scheduled for Wednesday, was canceled because of the blizzard. <p> " I am a little bit sad about missing it, " she said before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used both hands to scoop up piles of snow and toss them at his wife, Kalpana, and friends. All were covered in snow and wet. <p> " This was the first snow for me. We are enjoying it, " he said as snow melted on his head. " In India, we do n't have this kind of snow in our area. " <p> Balaiya, a post-doctoral fellow at University Hospital, has been in Denver for six months. <p> Shoveling good cheer <p> Nathan Rabb left Ace Hardware in Edgewater with three shovels propped over his shoulder. <p> " In case I wear the first one out, " he said, before conceding he picked up extras for his neighbors. <p> " I hope I do n't have to shovel it for them, too, " he said. <p> Next door at King Soopers, the business seemed typical of any Friday afternoon, except the shopping carts remained in the concrete alcove as customers slipped and scooted across the snow-packed parking lot toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay home and watch TV without chips and beer, " said Alverado Martinez, a hospital employee who was given a snow day. <p> Compiled by staff writers Kieran Nicholson, Claire Martin, Alison Sherry, Elizabeth Aguilera, Bruce Finley, Felisa Cardona, Diane Carman, Virginia Culver and Steve Lipsher. -- QUOTABLES <p> " This remains a dangerous storm still, especially on the Eastern Plains. " <p> Gov. Bill Owens, on Thursday as the snow was clearing out of the metro area but was heading over the plains. <p> " We 're certainly pushing as hard as we can. The question has not been, do we have enough plows? The question is, my goodness, what an incredible amount of snow we got in a short amount of time with a lot of wind. It kept blowing back on top of us. " <p> Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper <p> " What better time to do a burglary - the police were out in the blizzard. It 's like the looting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nathan Keller, owner of The Game Trader in Brighton, whose store was burglarized during Wednesday night 's blizzard. <p> " I live half a block away, so I figured I 'd put five hours on the clock, then call it a day and read some Dostoevsky. " <p> Dean Solecki, 21, Diedrich 's Coffee manager, after shoveling his walkways on East 12th Avenue. <p> " The sidewalks were covered with 6-foot piles of snow, so people were going down the middle of busy streets. It 's very dangerous. One car slips and that would be it. " <p> Terry Ross, Edgewater police officer <p> " It does n't look good. We 're completely socked in right now. " <p> Jerry Smith, Columbine Ridge HOA treasurer, who contracted with a new snow-removal company but had n't heard from the company as of Thursday afternoon. <p> " The storm has wound down. The lights are on. The music 's playing. Saturday, I think our members will be snowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president, hoping merchants can make up the holiday sales lost during the snowstorm. <p> " The city 's content to drop mag chloride and hope for the best, but you really need to move the snow. This is not shaking out. " <p> Mike Quigley, 57, Denver electrician <p> " A plow makes a pass when you 're getting snowfalls at that rate and an hour later you ca n't tell a plow 's been there. I know that there is great frustration with people who feel stranded in their homes because the neighborhood streets have a lot of snow on them. " <p> Bill Vidal, Denver public works manager <p> " We ca n't go home, the highway 's closed. We ca n't get to the car, it 's 10 miles away. And the hotels are not cheap. " <p> Jodie Hartfield, Colorado Springs, who was stranded with her husband and three young children at Denver International Airport on Wednesday night. <p> " This is n't an act of God. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Denver pharmacist who sat on the runway for hours Wednesday on a flight that was stuck in the snow. <p> " This blizzard is unprecedented, and it 's in our second-largest hub. It is completely unprecedented for the airport to be closed for two days. " <p> Jeff Kovick, United spokesman <p> " A lot of people are going to lose their holidays. The smart ones may decide to just stay home. " <p> Joe Brancatelli, who runs a travel website <p> " It 's just amazing how many people are still out there. " <p> Robert Thompson, spokesman for a local American Red Cross chapter, of people stranded on the roads after the blizzard.
