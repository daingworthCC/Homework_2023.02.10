4133641 On a sweltering summer day, far from the uncomfortable offseason pay cut negotiations, Peyton Manning stands under center. Gary Kubiak, who has two decades on his rxE9sumxE9 as a coach and offensive coordinator, scans the play sheet. Twenty yards away, John Elway, hand on hip, watches the play action develop, finishing with a short crossing route to tight end Owen Daniels. Three quarterbacks intersected at Dove Valley this offseason, forming an unlikely alliance as the Broncos attempt to erase the memory of last season 's one and done playoff exit. When Elway, the general manager, hired Kubiak as Denver 's 15th head coach, it cued a soundtrack : The band was back together. The Broncos won their only two Super Bowls in the 1997 and 1998 seasons with Elway running the plays and Kubiak calling them as coach Mike Shanahan 's offensive coordinator. The Broncos own four consecutive AFC West titles and have n't lost a divisional road game since Dec. 19, 2010. Yet when the Indianapolis Colts embarrassed the Broncos in the playoffs, the uninspired performance spawned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broncos as far as they could go, and " it was n't as far as I wanted to go, so it was a good opportunity to go in a different direction. " In his fifth season in charge, Elway trusts his gut more. But this is not the first time he has made a bold decision. Forget whims ; he 's chronically attuned to win. What made the Kubiak decision remarkable was Manning. He enters the season at 39, an age when a quarterback never has started a Super Bowl, let alone won one. His contract runs through the 2016 season, but this could be his last gasp, his final chance to add a second championship and first with the Broncos. Therein lies the motivation for this abrupt change beyond Elway 's desire to have a team that will go out " kicking and screaming. " A Super Bowl title remains the only thing Manning has n't accomplished since arriving in Denver. And now he is going to try to pull it off with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just know with Gary and his style and how he works, " Elway said. " He 's going to get along with everybody to find out a way to get it done. He 's not one of the guys who is going to back himself into a corner and say ' Absolutely not. ' If he feels like there 's a better solution, he will make that change. A lot of times, he does n't have that ego where you ca n't get better and work with people. That 's why the transition with Gary and Peyton coming together everybody talks about that it never concerned me at all because I know how Gary is. " Beginning in 2012, Manning has delivered the greatest three consecutive regular seasons by a quarterback anyone has witnessed. At the same time, his 14,863 yards and 131 touchdowns over this span did n't result in a ring. Manning has designs on becoming the first quarterback to win a Super Bowl with two teams, something not even Brett Favre, Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broncos their best opportunity, Elway turned to Kubiak, his longtime backup and training camp roommate. The faith in those two resonates with Broncos fans. Connecting the dots with Manning remains more difficult. No one disputes Manning 's excellence. The issue is how he fits in Kubiak 's zone blocking, running back friendly offense. " Great quarterbacks like Peyton can play in any offense. I do n't think it will be a tough year. He 's going to play well because he 's highly motivated to show that December and January were n't the real Peyton Manning, " said NBC analyst and former Colts coach Tony Dungy, who won a Super Bowl with Manning in the 2006 season. " He 's smart, and accurate, and they have put together an offense that 's going to score points and help them suffocate teams with a top five defense. " Two preseason appearances failed to soothe nerves as Manning failed to produce a touchdown drive in 62 plays. He did n't have speedy receiver Emmanuel Sanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new left guard Evan Mathis, who will make his debut in the season opener Sept. 13 against Baltimore. And the Broncos kept the playbook rather vanilla. Still, concern surfaced to the point where Manning was asked if he would lobby to use more shotgun formations and pass plays. " This is the Broncos ' offense, " Manning said. " I do n't know about how much negotiation is going on, but I think they 're all trying to put us in the best situations for us to move the ball and get down the field. And it 's our job to do that. " Since taking a $4 million pay cut in March, money he can earn back if the Broncos win the AFC championship and Super Bowl, Manning has committed fully to Kubiak 's system. He wanted to finish his career in Denver, not bounce around. Manning changed his offseason conditioning and diet. He added muscle and dropped 5 pounds, working out between speaking engagements and hunting trips. He accepted Kubiak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off, a routine designed to keep him fresher over the season 's final months. Manning is not expected to practice on Wednesdays during the season. Elway followed an identical schedule in his final years. Manning 's drive is so intense, it 's easy for his teammates to see the doubters inspire him. " He has a chip on his shoulder, " Sanders said. " You watch. " Manning threw 39 touchdown passes last season, second in the NFL, but only six over the final six games, counting the postseason. He strained his right quadriceps Dec. 14 at San Diego, viewed by Manning as a fluke injury because he was suffering from dehydration after becoming sick on the eve of the game. Manning 's finish spawned talk he might never win another championship. Elway concluded his 1996 season with a heartbreaking home playoff loss to Jacksonville, raising questions if he would ever win a single championship. Kubiak acknowledges parallels when explaining why he believes this marriage of blended offenses Manning 's arm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work. " I remember being part of that at the end of John 's career, and what we were trying to do with the team, " Kubiak said. " We had a young back, obviously. We stumbled across( Terrell Davis). We are sitting there and going : ' This guy is something else. We can take a lot of pressure off John, ' and we knew our defense would play well, " Kubiak said. "( With our current team), I think we have a chance to be great on defense between the skill and talent we have. I see a lot of similarities, and I also see the same hungry guy like we saw in John. And if we show up and say : ' Peyton, it 's yours. You are going to have to throw it 50 times for us to win today, ' I know he 's ready to do that. I have no doubt. " Kubiak has long demonstrated versatility in his play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only coach to have a receiver( Andre Johnson 2008 09), running back( Arian Foster 2010) and quarterback( Matt Schaub 2009) lead the NFL in yards. Kubiak will adapt. Manning already has changed, executing rollouts and even scrambling for a 1 yard gain during training camp. The change, however, is jarring for fans accustomed to watching the Broncos race up and down the field. Kubiak 's ground game owns an average rank of 10th as an offensive coordinator and head coach. Manning has n't played for a team with a top 10 running game since 2001. Finding common ground requires compromise, and with the preseason as proof, repetition. The Broncos, it can be argued, have won only one game when Manning has n't played well, last November 's 29 16 victory at Kansas City. He should n't have to shoulder a similar load this season. " If you are throwing the ball every down like he was for his whole career, where it was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Elway said. " Those numbers are great, but we have to figure out how to blend those together : Get numbers and win a championship. Plus, at 39 years old, you are not what you used to be even though your mind thinks you are better. Believe me, I went through it. Sometimes the body ca n't answer what the mind wants to do. This is why, to me, in the long run it 's going to help Peyton. He 's going through it, getting adjusted to it, and realizes that especially with the defense we have and the different ways we can play, it 's going to be a different style. He can still be a tremendous help in what he knows, his football intelligence. He will be as important as he ever was. It will just be in a different way. " Value is subjective. Huge stats make quarterbacks go early in fantasy league drafts. They have n't proved to be a reliable formula to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patriots, Seahawks, Ravens, Giants have leaned on reasonable to heavy doses of running games and strong defenses. In Manning 's lone Super Bowl championship season, he threw 31 touchdown passes and nine interceptions. " Exactly, " Elway said. " Do that and get us in the right plays in the passing game and get us out of bad running plays. His value is still the same. " Manning 's role, though, has changed. The Broncos no longer are defined by the lead singer. It is about the entire group. Why else would they get the band back together? " At this stage, to have a chance to come back and coach the Broncos, you never dream stuff like this would happen. It 's been really special, " Kubiak said. " And the fact that I have got a lot of people with me that have been a part of this place, we want to do it again. We want one of those rings. That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that John has put together on this team, this place gives you a great chance to do that. " Troy E. Renck : trenck@denverpost.com or twitter.com/troyrenck
