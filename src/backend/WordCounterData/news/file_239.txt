3044641 <p> Panama City Beach, Fla. -- These 27 miles of white sugar sand beaches and emerald waters on Florida 's Panhandle draw Atlantans like lemmings. <p> " Atlanta is without a doubt our No. 1 market, " says Jayna M. Leach, director of communications for the Panama City Beach Convention and Visitors Bureau. <p> We think nothing of the less than six-hour drive, and appreciate our proximity even more as we 're joined on I-85 by carloads of PCB-or-bust Midwesterners who happily drive two or three times as far as we do. <p> And so we motor on to championship golf, natural and artificial reefs for diving and snorkeling, great fishing, family amusements, affordable lodgings and restaurants galore. <p> Those looking for a sleepy little beach town should steer elsewhere. <p> You come here to " party with thousands "( the oceanfront Club La Vela, billed as " the largest nightclub in the USA, " can pack in 8,000) or to put your name on a list and wait an hour or more for a table at popular beachside restaurants such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ribs slathered in Jack Daniel 's barbecue sauce a week). <p> If you are of a certain age, you come to cruise the Miracle Strip, radios or CDs blaring and horns honking as the cars ' passengers holler and hoot at members of the opposite sex. <p> Panama City Beach is more than a nonstop party, although it might seem so during the spring break-intensive month of March, when frisky college kids let off steam at winter 's end. <p> Anglers have long been lured to the gulf and St. Andrews Bay for some of the world 's best sport fishing. Scuba divers and snorkelers are drawn to the natural reefs and shipwreck sites, where marine life abounds. <p> And PCB 's reputation as a golfing destination is growing. Golf Digest magazine named it to its " best little golf towns in the U.S. " list. The average greens fee is $46.80, and with 320 sunny days a year and a year-round average temperature of 74 degrees, there 's rarely a time when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sticks all the way from Sand Creek, Mich. <p> " We played Hombre today, " said Cremeans, as he, his wife and two of their three children enjoyed a sunset cruise on the 55-foot catamaran Island Time. " They have 27 holes called the Good, the Bad and the Ugly. We played the Good and the Bad today ; tomorrow we 're playing the Good and the Ugly. " <p>( A first-time visitor to Panama City Beach, Cremeans found his family 's lodgings, the Edgewater Beach Resort, on the Internet. Before he booked, he called the local Applebee 's and solicited candid comments about the resort from the waitress who answered the phone.) <p> Among the other golf courses are the Lagoon Legend and the Club Meadows at Bay Point ; Holiday Golf Club and Signal Hill. Plus, more than 20 courses are within 40 miles of the beach. <p> PCB could also be named the best little tattoo town in the U.S. One recent night, vacationers lined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waited to submit to a permanent souvenir.( For those less daring, most beach merchandise stores offer henna tattoos.) <p> Clearly, PCB is hanging onto its wild streak, even as the place grows and changes. <p> Spring 2003 has brought a boom of development, including an 80-acre city park at the Pier Park development, a new ride at the Miracle Mile Amusement Park that claims to be the tallest mechanized ride in North Florida and a $6.5 million expansion of the Gulf World Marine Park. <p> The mom-and-pop motels of our childhoods are mostly a thing of the past. They 're being torn down one by one to make way for more than 20 high-rise developments under construction or slated to begin work this year. Property values are way too high for modest two- or three-story motels. Opening this spring are the Legacy by the Sea, Sterling Beach and En Soleil( you ca n't miss its mango and turquoise twin towers). <p> Some may say the place is losing its charm as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far too rowdy during spring break( or too crowded with families in the summer). That there 's too much traffic. Maybe so, but thousands keep coming back again and again. <p> Part of its appeal may be that it 's not particularly chic, not South Beach or even Seaside. OK, it can feel a little tacky( Beads, 12 for 99 cents! Free hermit crabs! Thong contest tonight!), but PCB makes us feel like kids again. <p> If this middle-aged wife and mom can find happiness amid the bronzed and bikinied, order a frozen Dreamsicle libation in a glass that looks like a tiki god and not be embarrassed, cram into a go-kart and take a few turns around a track, and dream of parasailing( someday I 'll get the nerve) -- anyone can. <p> Where else can you spend the day at Shipwreck Island Water Park, then take a sunset cruise on a pirate ship called the Sea Dragon( complete with Jolly Rogers flying and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off cannons), have dinner at the Treasure Ship and slurp a frozen drink( alcoholic or not) in a plastic pirate glass and then cap the evening with a round of mini-golf at Skull Island Adventure across the street?( Or maybe Pirate 's Island Adventure Golf on Front Beach Road, if you 're heading that way.) <p> For beach purists who care nothing for such nonsense, where else can you find such beautiful beaches, still fresh from a $21 million renourishment project in the late ' 90s that added 50 feet of beach along a 16-mile stretch? Sand like this -- fine, sugary white and toe-ticklingly soft -- is the pride of the Emerald Coast. Dr. Beach( aka Stephen Leatherman), the Travel Channel, the Surfrider Foundation and readers of Southern Living sing its praises. <p> If you want to explore the natural side of Panama City Beach, the St. Andrews State Recreation Area on a 1,260-acre peninsula is your place in the sun with its sea-oat covered dunes. Day visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trails, birdwatching in Button Bush Marsh and surf fishing. <p> The park 's uplands are characterized by rolling sand dunes separated by low swales of either pine woods or marshes. Farther inland, the dunes are covered with sand pines, sand oaks, rosemary and other hardy plants that control erosion. The park 's 176 campsites can accommodate everything from tents to 40-foot recreational vehicles. Shuttle boats carry passengers to the undeveloped 700-acre Shell Island, a pristine barrier island just across the navigation channel from the mainland. <p> If you 've never been to Panama City Beach, or if it 's been awhile, here is some help to plan your adventure. <p> Play 's the thing <p> On-the-go families can stay busy from sun up to way after sundown with amusement parks, mini-golf, go-kart tracks( Emerald Falls Family Recreation Center has one that 's three stories high), bumper boats and arcades. Two of the most popular destinations : <p> * Gulf World Marine Park : The park 's recent expansion includes a 2,000-seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light show by night. On a recent morning, the Best sisters, Mackenzie, 8, and Kylie, 6, were chosen from the audience to direct some dolphin tricks, including a soaking by the playful mammals. Asked their favorite part, they replied in unison : " Getting wet! " Earlier, Kylie got to kiss a sea lion. " My hair still stinks! " <p> The girls and their parents were visiting relatives in Tallahassee and decided to drive to Panama City Beach for a couple of days. " Kylie is vacillating between wanting to be a surgeon or a marine biologist, " said mom Stacy, " so we decided to come here. It 's a lot closer than Sea World. " <p> In addition to the dolphin shows, the park has parrot shows, featuring tricks by several of the trained resident macaws, along with sea lion shows, shark feedings and underwater dive shows. The park also features special programs, including Meet the Dolphin Behind the Scenes Tour, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day camp for kids. 15412 Front Beach Road, 850-234-5271, **27;459;TOOLONG. <p> * Miracle Mile Amusement Park and Shipwreck Island Waterpark : The place to " splash by day, scream by night. " The family-style amusement park has rides ranging on the thrills scale from the carousel to the 2,000-foot-long Starliner roller coaster and the new O2 Tower, a ride that goes 185 feet in the air, followed by a three-second drop back to earth. 12000 Front Beach Road, 850-234-5810, www.miraclestrippark.com ; 850-234-0368, www.shipwreckisland.com. <p> Seagoing adventures <p> Getting out on the water is easy. Boat rentals, parasailing and excursions -- from wave runner cruises to sunset sails -- are widely available. Two options : <p> * Island Time : One of several excursions offered at beach marinas, the Island Time is a 55-foot catamaran with a 65-foot mast that sweeps through St. Andrews Bay and into the gulf waters for snorkeling and dolphin encounters by day and late-afternoon sunset cruises. We set sail at 4:30 p.m. with " Capt. Choppy " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( hope it 's not an omen). After several dolphin sightings and a picture-postcard sunset, we returned in the dark at 6:30 p.m. It was well worth $12( which includes one free drink). 3605 Thomas Drive at Treasure Island Marina. 850-234-7377, **25;488;TOOLONG. <p> * Sea Dragon : Aye, me hearties, come aboard for two hours of fun and foolishness on the high seas( OK, St. Andrews Bay and the Gulf of Mexico).

For my money -- $20 to be exact -- food does n't get much better than the quickly seared giant sea scallops with five-flavor vinaigrette, pickled ginger and fresh wasabi served with baby leeks, asparagus spears and jasmine rice. We also tried the whole pompano( $30), <p> deboned tableside. Pompano is only available for a few weeks in the early spring when it runs along the beaches, so it 's something of a delicacy. The wine cellar has thousands of bottles. Desserts are all made in-house. 850-236-1115, www.30degreeblue.com. <p> * Capt. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built this landmark restaurant in 1958 and sold it to the Patronis brothers in 1967.
