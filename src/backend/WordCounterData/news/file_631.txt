4137041 AMBIALET, France -- Perched on top of a mountain in this little village sits an 11th-century priory with a breathtaking panorama. Logistically, it 's in the Midi-Pyrenees section of southwestern France, an hour from the city of Toulouse, high above the Tarn River. But it feels more like a timeless, enchanted land from a fairy tale with princesses and warriors. I recently traveled there with a group of Pittsburghers to launch an annual summer program of art retreats and workshops. Called Pittsburgh Arts in France, it 's a collaborative between Saint Francis University in Loretto and Pittsburgh Filmmakers/Pittsburgh Center for the Arts. We stayed in the renovated monastery, or priory, used primarily during the school year for study abroad students from Saint Francis. The university has leased the historical site since 2007, effectively turning it into its French campus. To reach the priory( le Prieure) you go up, up and up some more. Once there, on this isolated mountaintop, the inclination is to stay put, soak in the view, the quiet, the light and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood pressure drop.) The air is crisp and clean. Every vantage point boasts a boundless, changing sky with big billowing clouds. The weather " blows off the Pyrenees, " a local tells me. But with its steep terrain, when the eventual pang to explore sets in, the way down involves some planning. There 's a paved country road -- great for walking, biking or driving if you have a car. It 's less than 2 miles into town. There 's also a rocky " goat path " that cuts right into the side of the mountain. It 's steep but much more direct, for those with good knees. Part of the folklore of Ambialet is how this charming town was formed on two levels : Ambialet-le-bas( the low) and Ambialet-le-haut( the high). Most likely the earliest inhabitants agreed that the top of the rock was the perfect spot to build a chapel -- reaching up closer to the heavens. Down by the Tarn river, the working people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. These days the town consists of a few shops, two cafes( Cafe de la Presqu'ile, better known as Nadine 's, is a favorite), one hotel, a fountain in the center of town, lovely shade trees, and a shallow river for swimming, fishing or kayaking. A relatively modern waterworks facility was built to look like a small medieval castle, which adds to the charm of this very small( population less than 75) village. The overall ambiance of the priory is rustic -- lots of stone and weathered wood in varying states of decay. Parts of it date back to the 11th century, while the new wings are " only " a few hundred years old. Like most of Europe, there are no screens on the windows. And there really are bats in the attic. Much renovation -- being done in stages -- has so far included a series of dorm rooms with large shared shower/bathroom facilities featuring modern plumbing( a few rooms have private baths), a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully equipped commercial-size kitchen. In addition, money was raised specifically for the creation of a spacious painting studio with floor-to-ceiling windows that capture the view in any weather. At meal times, the chapel bell rings at 12:30 and 7:30 and four large resident dogs howl in harmony. The friendly staff at the priory includes a year-round program director, housekeeper, cook, gardener, handyman and teachers. Our group of about 20 travelers was made up of those who signed on for painting or photography workshops, plus a half-dozen assorted staff from Filmmakers/Center for the Arts and Saint Francis University. The view is the best reason to come, most agreed. " It 's really nourishing, " one said. But it 's also the secluded nature of the location -- perfect for getting off the grid. The painters -- led by Pittsburgh artist Ron Donoughe, known for his plein-air paintings -- set up their easels outside each day. Whether down by the river, in the courtyard or perched on a bluff, the group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warm summer light. The photographers -- led by artist/professor Sue Abramson -- were a more diverse group with a wide range of interests : everything from landscape, portrait, architecture, fashion and nature photography, to one retired engineer who brought a drone equipped with a camera. Fortunately Ambialet and its surroundings offer a bounty of riches for shutterbugs. Mornings were most agreeable for the early birds who took nature walks ; evenings were for socializing( eating dinner, drinking wine) and later still, there was guitar playing and more drinking, for those who chose to partake. Baguette and cheese nibbling went on pretty much all day. The historic city of Albi is 30 minutes away. It 's a modern, sophisticated metropolis that retains its Old World charm. In addition to an array of stores and restaurants, a massive cathedral( Cathedrale Ste-Cecile) displays the largest collection of Italian Renaissance paintings in France. But Albi 's most famous native son is Henri de Toulouse Lautrec, and a museum is dedicated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cordes-sur-Ciel, a preserved ancient hilltop village( a " bastide ") dating to 1222. Today it 's a hub for artists and craftspeople. Visitors who traverse the winding cobblestones to the top, or take the shuttle, will be rewarded with quaint outdoor cafes, shops and a dazzling view. When you are this close to Spain and the Mediterranean, overnight trips are hard to resist. A few of us found it easy to rent a car in Albi and drive south to the Vermillion coast for a quick getaway. The seaport town of Collioure -- made famous by Henri Matisse -- was a highlight. Even if you never venture beyond Ambialet, there is entertainment. Most nights at Nadine 's, the outdoor patio is strung with lights, and live music is in the air. One night Jersey Julie( from New Jersey, no less) sang us the blues. Another night an Irish pub band, alternating between French and English lyrics, ended with what seemed like a scene from a movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet for an Irish jig. Seats fill quickly with tourists and locals who bring their babies, grandparents and dogs. Nadine 's serves ice cream and alcohol with equal delight. The village also offers a weekly outdoor movie, a karaoke night and a variety of summer festivals. Back on top of the mountain, the starry night sky is arguably more majestic than the day sky. The lack of light pollution provided the night owls with a rare chance to view distant constellations, planets and the Milky Way with new eyes. " Now this, " one visitor whispered, " is a religious experience. " After a farewell toast, just as we were about to venture into town, the sky darkened and cracked open, pouring so hard we had to stay. Instead we were treated to a spectacular rainbow that spanned the panoramic view we were all starting to take for granted. " Aha! " The sky seemed to say to us, " Look at me now. " Captivated, we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THERE From Pittsburgh, a seven-hour-plus nonstop flight on Delta takes you to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. From there you either catch a five-hour train or a 1 1/2-hour flight( Air France) to Toulouse. From Toulouse, it takes another hour by car through rural France to get to Ambialet. You can rent a car, but as part of the Pittsburgh Arts in France group, a van ride is provided from the airport to the monastery in Ambialet. Travel time from Pittsburgh : more than 12 hours.
