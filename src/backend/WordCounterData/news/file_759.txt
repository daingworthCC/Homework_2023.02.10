4198141 <p> Something big was needed to take the focus, if even for a day or a few hours, away from the Carmelo Anthony saga as the center of the Knicks ' universe. And Kyrie Irving wanting out of Cleveland did just that. <p> Especially with the Knicks as one of the teams occupying a slot on his preferred list of landing places. <p> The Knicks, naturally, salivate over the idea of adding Irving. But they do n't want to part with Kristaps Porzingis and, according to league sources, Willy Hernangomez. But one neutral observer from another team offered one assessment. <p> " If you could get Irving and it came down to Kyrie or Hernangomez, you 'd probably see Hernangomez on the first plane out, " he said. " But I just can not see it happening unless the Knicks give up Porzingis. " <p> The Knicks would swap Anthony plus future picks for Irving virtually without thought. Anthony has a no-trade clause which he is willing to waive for the right situation. <p> The Knicks already have discussed Anthony 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost him about $8 million -- in a deal to Houston, his preferred landing spot. The Rockets have Anthony 's buddy, Chris Paul, and the MVP runner-up, James Harden, already in-house. Anthony also has given indications he would surrender his no-trade clause for a deal to the Cavaliers. But that was to a Cleveland team that included Irving. <h> see also <p> And just because Irving wants a trade, does n't mean the Cavaliers will comply. League sources confirmed the request was made but after that, there were numerous reports regarding the cause of Irving 's discontent. <p> Some say Irving wants to be the focal point of his own show, impossible with LeBron James in Cleveland. Others contend Irving, the 25-year-old point guard who grew up in West Orange, N.J., merely is being proactive and is trying to get out the door before James, whose apparent dissatisfaction with the Cavaliers ' offseason has been chronicled. James also was reportedly " blindsided " by the Irving request. <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Warriors, a team that almost impossibly improved in the offseason. Cleveland whacked general manager David Griffin and in free agency, re-signed Kyle Korver, added ex-Knick Jose Calderon and European Cedi Osman. Not exactly moves that counter the Warriors re-signing Kevin Durant. The Cavaliers also are expected to meet with point guard Derrick Rose this week. Rose is expected to choose between the Cavaliers and the Lakers after his one-year run with the Knicks. <p> So maybe Irving too just wants to bolt before the Cavaliers ' ship takes on too much water, especially with speculation James will leave next summer. <p> Irving has three years left on his contract, the third for 2019-20 at player option. He is due nearly $39 million for the next two years, $60 million for three. <h> see also <p> Although Latvian journalists were instructed not to query Kristaps Porzingis... <p> After Irving 's request became public Friday, ESPN reported his list of preferred destinations as the Knicks, Spurs, Timberwolves and Heat. Of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season. Obviously, if the Cavs even were inclined to attempt to honor Irving 's wishes, the asking price would be enormous. <p> " Asking for a trade and being traded are two different things, " one insider said. <p> Just ask Anthony. The Knicks all too well know the difficulty of getting an equitable return for a player with a no-trade clause, even if he will lift it for certain teams. <p> The Anthony scenario has become a waiting game. The Knicks are intent on getting young players or draft pick assets for the 10-time All-Star who has made his desire for Houston perfectly clear. There is no buyout -- or apparently a quick resolution -- in the immediate picture.
