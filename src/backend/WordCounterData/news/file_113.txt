3022441 <p> With the military 's backing, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was ousted Monday by a group of hard-liners who said they were trying to prevent a " national catastrophe. " They imposed a state of emergency that sent armored vehicles into the streets and threatened Gorbachev 's historic reforms. <p> Russian republic President Boris N. Yeltsin accused the hard-liners of staging " an unconstitutional reactionary coup " and called an immediate general strike to protest Gorbachev 's removal. <p> Vice President Gennady Yanayev( yah-neye ' -yeff), a hard-liner Gorbachev had nominated to be the country 's No. 2 official, said he was taking over as president with the support of the defense minister, the KGB and police chiefs and other officials. <p> Hundreds of tanks and armored personnel carriers were moving into Moscow, witnesses said. <p> Marina Yurchenko said she saw up to 500 military vehicles, in column after column, moving into the city on Begovaya Street toward Gorky Street, one of the main routes to the Kremlin. <p> The convoy, seen just before 9 a.m., included 30 or 40 tanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yurchenko said. <p> The KGB took one private radio station off the air. Many commuters, however, were going to work normally. <p> An official announcement said the 60-year-old Gorbachev - who in six years of rule had transformed the Soviet Union into a freer society - could no longer rule for unspecified health reasons. <p> However, there have been no recent signs he was ill, and in Soviet parlance, poor health is often cited as a reason to retire a senior official. <p> Gorbachev was last reported on vacation in the Crimea and had been due to return to Moscow on Monday. His whereabouts were unknown. <p> Gorbachev 's supporters issued no immediate response, but for months they have been warning of a coup. Yeltsin, the other major Soviet political figure, was reported in his Moscow office, said spokeswoman Natalya Kostiuk. <p> Yanayev, a 53-year-old veteran Communist, said in a statement carried by the Tass news agency he was declaring the state of emergency " with the aim of overcoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil strife, chaos and anarchy that threaten the lives and security of the Soviet Union 's citizens and its sovereignty, territorial integrity, freedom and independence. " <p> The steps were being taken, he said, " to prevent society from sliding into national catastrophe and ensure law and order. " <p> Gorbachev has angered hard-liners by making concessions to the United States on arms control, failing to improve the economy and failing to force the 15 republics to obey national laws. <p> One of Gorbachev 's closest allies, Alexander Yakovlev, resigned from the Communist Party on Friday, warning that Communist hard-liners were plotting " a party and state coup. " Gorbachev 's longtime foreign minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, had warned of a coming dictatorship when he resigned last December. <p> Tass said a committee of eight officials had been formed to take " decisive measures " in the state of emergency, declared for six months in " individual localities. " His statement did not say what areas were affected or what measures would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members are Yanayev, Defense Chief Dmitri Yazov, KGB Chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov, Interior Minister Boris Pugo and Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov. Pugo 's duties including supervising the police. " All power in the country is transferred for this period to the state committee for the state of emergency in the U.S.S.R., " Yanayev 's statement said. <p> The statement appeared to wrest at least some power from the republics, by declaring that national laws " have unconditional priority throughout the territory of the USSR. " <p> The emergency measures effectively prevent Gorbachev from signing a treaty with other republic leaders to give them more power. They had been scheduled to initial the agreement on Monday. Hard-liners had said the pact would effectively hobble the central government 's power and transfer authority to the republics. <p> An independent radio station, Moscow Echo, was taken off the air Monday by men who showed KGB identification, said Alexi Nikonov, a reporter in the station at the time. <p> Somber announcers read the news repeatedly on state-run radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second-largest city in the republic of Lithuania, Soviet troops surrounded the television tower that was the voice of the secessionist government, said Rita Dapkus, a spokeswoman for the republic 's parliament. No other details were available. <p> Yanayev, elected vice president in September at Gorbachev 's suggestion, said he was taking over the president 's duties under Article 127, Clause 7, of the Soviet constitution. <p> In his statement on the state of emergency, addressed to heads of state and government and U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, Yanayev assured world leaders the emergency measures are temporary. <p> " They in no way mean renunciation of the course towards profound reforms in all spheres of life, " said Yanayev, whose title was given as acting president. <p> " These are forced measures, dictated by the vital need to save the economy from ruin and the country from hunger, to prevent the escalation of the threat of a large-scale civil conflict with unpredictable consequences. " <p> The statement said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be liquidated. Ethnic groups in several republics have formed " defense units " to protect citizens against clashes with other minorities, and in some cases from Soviet troops. <p> The White House, caught by surprise, had no immediate comment. Spokesman Doug Davidson, in Kennebunkport, Maine, said President Bush was told of the news. <p> Moscow 's radio stations played classical music, as they have in the past when a leadership change was announced. <p> Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange plummeted over 1,000 points Monday afternoon on news that Gorbachev was no longer in power. The reports pushed the dollar sharply higher against the yen. <p> Gorbachev was to have interrupted his summer holiday and travel to Moscow on Monday to sign the new Union Treaty, which he had been working on for four months to keep the country together. <p> He left Moscow on Aug. 4 for the Crimea, four days after he and Bush signed the historic Strategic Arms Control Treaty on the reduction of nuclear weapons amid Kremlin fanfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In 1964, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, another reformist leader who had angered hard-liners, was removed in a bloodless coup while he was vacationing. <p> Yanayev 's statement assured world leaders that the state of emergency measures do not mean the Soviet Union would abrogate international treaties and agreements. <p> The Union Treaty is Gorbachev 's major domestic political achievement this summer. It strengthens the powers of the republics, giving them more control over their finances and natural resources. It also augments the powers of the lower house of the national legislature, which consists of representatives of the republics.
