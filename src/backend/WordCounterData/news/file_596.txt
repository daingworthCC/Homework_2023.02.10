Day 8 The Aurora movie theater shooting trial moves into its eighth day Thursday as prosecutors call their next round of witnesses. Prosecutors have called dozens of witnesses, including survivors who were inside the theater, law enforcement and professors from the University of Colorado. The professors worked with James Holmes while he was enrolled in the neuroscience graduate program. A mix of witnesses is expected on Thursday. Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to the attack at the Aurora movie theater on July 20, 2012. Twelve people were killed and 70 were injured. If he is convicted, Holmes could face the death penalty. Court resumed at 8:40 a.m. 8:54 a.m. Prosecutor Karen Pearson called FBI Special Agent Toni Payne to the stand on Thursday. Payne is a crime scene photographer with the FBI. Payne was called to the movie theater on July 20, 2012 where she took photographs in the back parking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photograph the suspect 's vehicle and objects in the back parking lot. Pearson handed Payne a stack of photographs she took behind the theater. One of the photographs showed the rear parking lot behind Theater Nine that showed Holmes ' white car. A different photograph showed the northeast corner, blood spatters, gloves and clothing scattered on the ground. 8:59 a.m. Payne flipped through a second stack of photographs that were handed to her. As they were shown to the jury, Payne described the blood on the sidewalk leading away from the emergency exit and Holmes ' car. A sun shade and a can of law enforcement grade tear gas were shown lying next to car. The passenger door of the car was flung open. 9:07 a.m. The third stack of Payne 's photographs showed the rear exit door from Theater Nine. A rifle, two pink flip flops and a metal clip was on the door. A close up of the scene showed there was a magazine in the rifle. Blood spatter surrounded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographs to the jury that showed the rifle and the entryway into Theater Nine. The metal bracket clip found on the door was wrapped in blue tape. Stack five of Payne 's photographs showed close up shots of objects found in the parking lot. The first was a photo showing an air tank and mask next to Holmes ' car. Clothing and shoes were scattered in the background. 9:17 a.m. A seventh set of photographs were shown to the jury. Payne described the items that were found behind the theater, including a close up of what appeared to be a tactical belt with ammunition and a flashlight tucked into it. Payne also took a close up of the belt where two shot gun shells were stored. The next group of photographs focus on the different types of batteries that were found near a duffle bag. Payne also described a ninth set of photographs that she took of the exit of Theater Nine, including the nearby trash bin. Medical equipment, body armor and other clothing were shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body armor 's label showed it was manufactured in July 2012. 9:27 a.m. More photos showed medium sized pants and a belt. There was an iPod in the back right pocket of the pants. The next group of photos a black boot and a metal clip covered in blue tape. A Taser was lying next to the boot. The Taser looks like a cellphone with stickers of a screen and buttons. A clip, similar to the one that was seen on the emergency exit door, was also lying next to the boot. A knife was shown in the next photograph. A different knife was shown next. The blades of both knives were not displayed. A loaded ammunition magazine was also shown next to one of the knives. Payne described the next set of photographs that captured a black, puffy jacket and a size 11 boot. The next photo showed a black tactical vest, the next a black tactical helmet. 9:39 a.m. Prosecutors zoomed in on a photograph of Holmes ' car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of handcuffs were lying on the pavement. The next set of Payne 's photographs showed a side shot of Holmes ' car with the trunk popped and the driver 's door open. Magazines of ammunition were scattered on the pavement next to it. Inside the car there were " metal spikes " and more magazines. An iPhone with a case that looks like a cassette tape. A pair of sunglasses were found next to the metal spikes on the seat. A photo taken from the front of Holmes ' car showed the white car with the door and trunk doors open. The passenger seat had broken glass and a tactical glove on it. The vehicle 's registration had Holmes ' full name on it. It was lying next to a shotgun shell. 9:48 a.m. The front passenger side door pocket had a handgun tucked into it. Payne described the next set of photographs, which showed the passenger side of Holmes ' car. On the ground next to it was a gas mask, body armor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top of Holmes ' car. Payne 's photo of the back passenger tire showed a gun cleaning kit on the pavement and the gas mask. A tactical glove was next to the gun cleaning kit. A tube of cleaning lubricant was shown on the pavement next to the kit. The next photo showed a law enforcement grade of tear gas on the pavement and a sun shield. An up close photograph of the can showed the words, " Clear Out. " Payne said the can appeared to be full. A photo taken from the back of Holmes ' car showed the backboard that had been shoved under the car. 9:57 a.m. Payne said she was asked to remove the iPhone from Holmes ' car. On Thursday, Pearson handed her the phone in an evidence bag. Defense attorney Katherine Spengler cross examined Payne. She asked if there had been any attempts to disguise the license plates on the car. Payne said there was none. Payne said she did not search the car and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One shirt found in the pile several feet away from the car came from the inside the car, she said.. Payne, in response to questions from Spengler, said she did not see any tents or camping equipment, a passport or cash inside the car. The judge read three questions to Payne submitted by the jury. In your experience what is a Guard Dog Taser? Payne said she was not familiar with them. What time did you take the photographs? She took the photographs between 8:30 a.m. and 12:10 p.m. on July 20, 2012. Did the handcuffs appear to be new? She said she did n't know. 10:05 a.m. Pearson called FBI Special Agent Nick Vanicelli, who is part of an evidence collection team for the bureau. Vanicelli said he arrived at the theater around 4 a.m. When he arrived there was a large number of police and fire vehicles and officers working to secure the scene. Vanicelli and his team were asked to locate and mark items of evidence and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In general, his team collected weapons, ammunition, clothing, personal items and tactical items. " There was a large amount of stuff in the parking lot, " he said. On Thursday, Pearson approached Vanicelli with large plastic evidence bags. Inside one of them was a tactical bag with lubricant for weapons and a user 's manual for an AR 15 rifle. The next bag had an orange blanket inside. Vanicelli said he collected the items from behind the theater. Pearson also carried the long hard sided plastic rifle case and the soft bright green rifle case up to the witness stand. 10:11 a.m. Vanicelli was handed a large plastic bag with a black tactical canvas bag inside it. Pearson continued to make trips from behind the podium up to the witness stand, carrying clunky bags of evidence with her. Vanicelli held up an orange canvas bag and then a green long sleeve shirt. Once Vanicelli was done discussing each exhibit, Pearson would carry it to table in front of the jury box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pearson stacked them on top of each other. Next Vanicelli held up a black, tactical neck protector. After that he described a blue backpack that was collected, followed by a black tactical canvas bag. 10:14 a.m. Three more items were carried up to Vanicelli. The first one was a black and blue canvas bag, next were packages of batteries and the third were handcuffs. Pearson lobbed the exhibits on to the table. The judge has called for the morning break. Court will resume in 20 minutes. 10:42 a.m. Vanicelli was back on the stand after the morning break. Pearson carried two plastic evidence bags to the witness stand. Inside the first bag was a black gas mask. A photo of the gas mask was also shown to the jurors.The next item was a pair of black, tactical gloves. The thick plastic bags make a crunching sound as Pearson stacks them on the table. The jury will be allowed to pass around some of the items at a later time. Vanicelli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The brand on the pants was " Silence. " Two more bags were carried up. Vanicelli carried the clunky bags down from the witness stand so the jury could see them. He described the " ballistic chaps, " one for each leg, in the bags. 10:48 a.m. Next Vanicelli was handed the ballistic vest he collected from behind the theater. He held it up, pointing to the pouches on the vest where items could be stored. A black helmet was handed to Vanicelli. Caught inside the webbing of the helmet were bright orange hairs. The judge gave Vanicelli permission to cut open the plastic bag and look inside the helmet. He saw two or three orange hairs inside. The jury was shown the inside of the helmet. Pearson used a deputy 's flashlight to highlight the hairs twisted around the padding. The helmet wobbled on the table when Pearson tried to stack it on top of other items of evidence. 11 a.m. Vanicelli struggled to hoist up a heavy black jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the plastic bag as Vanicelli handed them back to Pearson. The next two items Vanicelli collected from behind the theater were a " extreme ops " folding knife and a second black gas mask. The plastic bags holding the items slid off the top of the pile when Pearson tried to balance them. Two tactical groin protecter and an arm protecter were handed to Vanicelli, who held them up for the jury Next, Vanicelli stared down at the third gas mask he collected from behind the theater. Pearson had to sway her weight from side to side to help her carry the next bag of evidence to the front of the room. The long plastic bag was separated into 10 sections. Each was filled with different ammunition magazines collected from near Holmes ' car. Above Vanicelli, a photo of the magazines in a pile next to Holmes ' car was displayed. One of the magazines was for the high powered rifle. Thirty rounds were inside it. The other nine magazines each had 22 rounds loaded inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags. One of them was a single, unused bullet that was found near the door of the theater. The next was a loaded ammunition magazine for a handgun. Vanicelli handed the bags back to Pearson, who then handed him two more bags. Inside them were unused shotgun rounds and an ammunition magazine for a handgun. The Taser designed to look like a cell phone was handed to Vanicelli. On the end of the box, two electrodes pointed toward each other. The next bag held metal clips that had been wrapped in blue tape. One was used to hold the emergency door open, the other was found near the trash bins. In what appeared to be shrink wrapped plastic, Pearson handed Vanicelli the second knife he collected behind the theater. He also held up a holster for a handgun. 11:23 a.m. A bag as long as Pearson is tall was carried up to the witness stand next. Inside was the high powered rifle Vanicelli collected from behind Theater Nine. " It has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Vanicelli struggled to balance the long gun as he looked searched for the serial number. In a second bag, Vanicelli looked at the ammunition magazine. Loose rounds could be heard jingling inside the plastic bag. Vanicelli was handed two empty evidence boxes. They were the original boxes Vanicelli used to collect the two handguns from the scene. He described the two guns. One had a laser sight, another was designed to be able to hold more ammunition, he said. Vanicelli said other evidence was collected inside of the theater, but his focus was on the back parking lot. He did assist with the collection of personal items in Theater Eight and other areas. Defense attorneys did not ask Vanicelli any questions. 11:32 a.m. The judge read Vanicelli five questions submitted by the jury. Did you collect the Bluetooth earpiece that an officer said was attached to the gas mask? " I do n't recall, " Vanicelli said. Was a bullet chambered in either of the handguns? The gun on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one inside the car did not, he said. Can the tactical gear and tear gas be purchased at stores or are they a specialty item? Vanicelli said he did not know. Do magazines come loaded or do you have to load them one bullet at a time? " You have to load them one bullet at a time, " Vanicelli said. Did you look at the gas gauge and see how much gas was in Holmes ' car? No, he said. 11:43 a.m. Prosecutor Jacob Edson called Kyle Burdette, who is an executive for the company Action Target, which owns Law Enforcement Targets. Law Enforcement Targets sells shooting supplies, everything from targets to cleaning items. They company has an online website that is open to the public. The site does not require law enforcement credentials. The company uses a system that tracks customer records, when people come to the store they have to enter information that is maintained in that system. Burdette looked at an invoice dated June 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paper targets, target stickers and stands that hold paper targets. He described the invoice, including who ordered the items and where the items were shipped. The order was placed on June 18, 2012 and was likely shipped two days later, Burdette said. The order included 25 paper targets depicting a person in an aggressive appearance. It also included stickers to mark where the target was hit and a device to help dispense the stickers. Twenty five different paper targets depicting people in threatening poses were also ordered. The order also included a stand to fix the paper target to and two replacement pieces. 11:47 a.m. The order also included 100 paper bulls eye targets. The total order cost $282.72, Burdette said. With shipping, the order cost $289. A Master Card was used to pay for the order. Defense attorneys did not ask Burdette any questions. 11:52 a.m. After Burdette stepped off the stand, court staff started handing the evidence bags described by Vanicelli one by one to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be careful with the evidence bags. A box of blue latex gloves was placed near the jury for those who wanted to handle the helmet that was removed from its bag earlier today. A member of the judge 's staff repeatedly worked her way from the front right corner of the jury box, where she handed the jury the items, to the front left of the box where she later picked them up. 12:11 p.m. All of the items were passed from one juror to the next. The judge has released the jurors for a lunch break. The jury is due back in the courtroom around 1:40 p.m. 1:50 p.m. Prosecutor Lisa Teesch Maguire called Amanda Teves to the stand. Teves was Alex Teves ' girlfriend when the two went to the movies on July 20, 2012. After Alex was killed she legally changed her name last name from Lindgren to Teves. " Alex really loved Batman and all superheroes for that matter, " Teves said. In court on Thursday, Teves described Alex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clasping her hands, Teves said she met Alex while they were both students at the University of Denver. When they arrived at the theater, Alex was so eager to get good seats that he sprinted up the stairs to grab them. 1:56 p.m. During the previews, Teves knew Alex was going to was n't goint to want to cuddle, that he would want to focus on the screen. She turned to him and asked him for " one last kiss. " Starting to cry, Teves said Alex gave her that kiss. Teves saw a can fly across the room. It made a noise and as smoke started to billow people stood up to see what it was. " Just after that I started seeing flashing lights. It sounded like fireworks, " she said. " I did n't know what was going on but Alex did. " Alex threw his arm around her and pulled her to the ground. She asked what was happening. He kept telling her it was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing over and over to me until I heard someone yelling they 'd been hit, " she said. She thought it was her friend. But she looked down at her hands and realized the were in a pool of blood. " I yelled for Alex. I started shaking his tummy but he was n't answering me, " Teves said. 1:58 p.m. She looked up and saw her friend and she " knew something was really wrong " when she saw his face. It was covered in blood. " I could tell Alex had been hit in the head because of what else was on his face, " she said. Parts of Alex were on her friend 's face. She did n't want to go. She did n't want to leave him there. But the people behind her told her she had to. She grabbed her friend 's hand, but she grabbed Alex 's hand, too. " I wanted to take him with me, " Teves said. She could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run out. She never saw Alex alive again. Teves looked at a photo of Alex as she wiped away tears. Defense attorneys did not ask Teves any questions. 2:03 p.m. The jury asked Teves a question. Can you tell us again what your relationship was to Alex Teves? " He 's my boyfriend, " she said. 2:07 p.m. Craig Enlund was called to the stand next. Enlund said he and his friend Alex Teves were huge Batman fans. The group all met in their graduate program at DU. While they waited for the movie to start, the group played games on their phones. Enlund saw something fly across the room. Everyone leaned over to see what it was. From the corner he heard what he thought were firecrackers. " Fairly quickly I realized it was gunfire. I could see flashes coming form the guns, " he said. " We hit the ground. " He remembers lying on his right side. He pulled his friend down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point there was a loud and forceful something that hit nearby, " he said. " I saw Alex slump to the ground. Amanda started screaming his name and shaking him. " Enlund said he knew they needed to leave, so he grabbed Amanda and ran. 2:15 p.m. In the parking lot, Enlund was trying to get information about Alex, but people kept telling him he was hurt. Someone finally grabbed him and told him that he had shrapnel in him. He was taken to a hospital in an ambulance. As the paramedic was wiping blood off of his face, he looked to his right and saw his reflection. " I could see bits of something on my head, on my face, " Enlund said. The paramedic told him that it was " pieces of Alex. " At the hospital he was checked for injuries. A detective came and spoke with him. Eventually they removed a small metal fragment from below Enlund 's left eye. Enlund looked down as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was in the hospital. 2:21 p.m. Enlund was also handed a photo of Alex Teves. He held back tears as he told the prosecutor he never saw Teves alive again. Defense attorneys did not ask Enlund any questions. The judge read Enlund four questions submitted by the jury. Was Alex 's head above the seat backs or below that level when he was hit? It was below the level of the seat backs, he said. Did you see where the gunman moved inside the theater? No, he said. Do you know how long the shooting lasted? No, he said. Did you see the gunman exit the theater? No, he said. 2:24 p.m. Janette Guscott was called to the stand. She works in the Aurora police department 's crime lab. On July 20, 2012, she was called to process Holmes, she said. She met him at police headquarters on the third floor. His back was to her when she walked in. He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue shorts and one sock. She immediately noticed his orange hair. His hands were covered with bags. On Thursday, Guscott identified Holmes as the man she met. She told Holmes she was doing a gunshot residue test on him. Holmes looked at Guscott when she asked him for his name and appeared to understand her questions, she said. 2:29 p.m. Guscott held up an unused testing kit. The kits, which are sealed, contain swabs and gloves, she said. In the courtroom, she opened the kit and set the items out on the witness stand. Guscott pointed to the instructions and information sheets that come with each kit. There are four tabs, one for the right hand, one for the left hand, one for the face and one for control. The tabs are pressed to the skin to collect the gunshot residue. Once everything is collected, it is placed back in the bag and sealed. Guscott said she explains the process whenever she tests someone. Holmes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guscott the kit that she used to test Holmes. 2:35 p.m. Guscott removed the paper bags placed on Holmes ' hands by detectives before she performed the test. She was handed the bags in court on Thursday. After she removed the bags and performed the test on Holmes, Guscott took photographs of Holmes. The photos were shown to the jury. They showed Holmes standing slouched, without a shirt on. The photographs were to document how he appeared at the time. Guscott did not find any injuries on Holmes. Holmes ' clothing was also collected by Guscott. Pearson handed Guscott three plastic evidence bags containing Holmes ' clothes. The first was a pair of white socks. The second bag held Holmes ' gray T shirt and the last bag contained the navy blue shorts he was wearing. 2:40 p.m. Guscott said she collected the shirt and socks from the interview room. An officer retrieved Holmes ' shorts from the jail. She also collected the paper bags that were placed on Holmes ' hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sensitive evidence, she said. Guscott said she spent a total of 15 minutes with Holmes. Guscott said there was nothing different or unusual about Holmes ' appearance or behavior, compared to other suspects she 's worked with. 2:45 p.m. Guscott also collected Holmes ' iPod from the front pocket of the tactical trousers brought by the FBI from the back of the movie theater. She was also brought a " Clear Out " canister of tear gas to process. Defense attorney Dan King cross examined Guscott. King asked Guscott to clarify where she first met Holmes on the third floor. Guscott said she does not know how long Holmes had been in the interview room before she arrived or how long he had the paper bags on his hands. He asked her why she thought Holmes ' appeared normal. One of the photos was placed on the screen. King asked if his eyes appeared as dilated in person as they did in the picture. She said they did. 2:50 p.m. Guscott said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and face for gunshot residue to determine if he was near a gun that had been fired, she said. In response to questions, Guscott said she repackaged the iPod after the FBI delivered it because the Aurora police department needed to log it for their use. King handed Guscott an evidence bag containing a live round of rifle ammunition collected from the back of the theater. Guscott packaged the bullet after the FBI brought it in. King pointed out a dent on the side of the shell casing of the bullet. Guscott said she did not recognize the dent. An evidence bag with several bullets jingled when King handed it to Guscott. The bag had 31 bullets found in a magazine. 2:59 p.m. Prosecutors did not ask Guscott any follow up questions. The judge read Guscott six questions submitted by the jury. Were the defendant 's pupils dilated or bloodshot? They were dilated but she did n't know whether they were bloodshot. Where was the other sock? The sock was on the floor, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was happening? No, she said. Do you check to see if a detained person is wearing contacts? No, she said. Did Holmes have contacts in? " I do not know, " she said. Did you find any eyeglasses in Holmes ' possession? No, she said. 3:32 p.m. Prosecutor Jacob Edson called Carol Crowe, who is a forensic scientist with the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. Crowe is assigned to the lab were she analyzes evidence for gunshot residue. Crowe has worked for CBI for 19 years and has worked on gunshot residue analysis for 18 of those years. She has also testified in more than 140 cases. She estimated she has analyzed about 7,000 samples. The judge ruled that Crowe will be admitted as an expert witness in gunshot residue. Crowe said she is looking for a specific element in the gunshot residue essentially the primer that helps cause the reaction that pushes the bullet out of the gun. 3:38 p.m. Crowe described the kit that is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same sticky tabs that are used to pull samples off of a person are also used to draw samples from objects as well. She also uses two scientific instruments. The first is a high powered microscope to search the sample for particles that meet a certain criteria. The next instrument is used to obtain information about the elements that are present in that particle and save that information. In January 2013, Crowe was working with CBI, which accepts items for testing from agencies across the state. That month she received samples taken from Holmes and a gas mask and gloves to test. The three different items were carried to the witness stand on Thursday. 3:44 p.m. When Crowe receives a testing kit, she removes the collection device. She said the kit came back positive for gunshot residue. The positive results can not distinguish whether Holmes ' fired a gun or was near a gun when it was fired, she said. Crowe also examined the gas mask. She tested the mask for gunshot residue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again the test only confirms the mask was in the vicinity of a gun when it was fired or came into contact with something with residue on it. The gloves were also tested. She tested the backs of the gloves as well as the palms. The tests came pack positive for gunshot residue particles. 3:52 p.m. Crowe described the control sample that is used when testing the items. The control sample, or " blank, " taken from Holmes was used to ensure that the items were not contaminated while in the lab. She also uses controls to ensure the instruments she uses are working properly. The lab also uses copper to essentially reset the machines. Defense attorney Dan King cross examined Crowe. He asked her to clarify the three conclusions a positive test can show. " You ca n't exactly attribute where the gunshot residue came from, " King said. Crowe said that was correct. The three conclusions are that someone shot a gun, was near a gun when it was fired or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it. King also asked her about the reactions and process that makes a gun fire to ask about how gunshot residue is spread. Residue can also come out gun 's muzzle. If a gun is fired outdoors, residue is harder to track, Crowe said. In an enclosed space it is easier to find the particles. 3:57 p.m. Crowe said she does not solely rely on the automated function of the microscope to test samples. She also looks through the microscope to manually locate the particles, but the automatic setting moves much faster. She does not go back and check each particle that is identified by the automatic setting on the microscope. She does do a random confirmation of a handful of particles identified by the microscope. She does not draw any conclusions based on the number of particles that are identified by the instruments. In testing the samples associated with Holmes, Crowe said she could not determine how many rounds were fired, how close the weapon was to a victim or object, how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trigger based on her findings. 4:11 p.m. The judge read Crowe eight questions submitted by the jury. How long does gunshot residue last or stay on items? Typically they will remain on objects until they are removed. GSR on people is typically removed earlier because of daily living, she said. How long does GSR last or stay on hands or skin? There 's a general consensus that the particles are removed within a few hours, she said. It could be longer depending on the activity. How long does GSR remain on a person or object? " I 've answered that, " she said. Would handling an unused shotgun shell leave GSR or a gun if they do n't fire a gun? It is less likely that GSR will be carried over from unused ammunition, more likely for a gun, she said. Can results be affected by how long someone is around GSR? Depending on the activity it could, she said. Can GSR get onto someone 's skin underneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. But generally clothing will stop the transfer unless the clothing is removed, then it can be transferred. Did the GSR test done on James Holmes test positive for both his hands and face? The hands were positive, the face was not, she said. But she warned the jury not to draw conclusions based on that. 4:20 p.m. District Attorney George Brauchler called Emily Sullivan Gibson, who works as lab tech in one of the labs at the University of Colorado where Holmes did a rotation in 2011 and 2012. Gibson works as a support role for students and helps Dell'Acqua run the lab. She has worked at the lab for 12 years and has worked with about 20 to 30 students similar to Holmes. One of those students was Holmes, she said. Gibson said it is usually one rotational graduate student at a time. In 2011, Gibson was in charge of teaching Holmes techniques to complete his experiments and research. She also was tasked with preparing samples for Holmes to preform experiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lab are typically more self motivated, are inquisitive and ask questions, Gibson said. Holmes ' demeanor was very quiet when Gibson first met him, even " laid back, " she said. They two would speak about the work that needed to be done and that was about it, she said. Gibson said she expected that demeanor to change over time, but it did not, she said. " It just seemed as though he was n't interested, " she said. " Over time you felt he was n't interested. " But Gibson said that has happened for other students. Gibson said she tried to get Holmes motivated in the lab, but she eventually gave up. She mostly saw him sitting at his desk, with his headphones on looking at his laptop. 4:29 p.m. Gibson had to show Holmes how to do experiments more than once, she said. His expression was hard to read, it went from being blank to hard to read. She could n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they were doing. Toward the end of the rotation, Gibson saw Holmes ' give a " push " to gather data for his final presentation. Gibson saw a practice presentation Holmes gave before his final. She called it a " little rough around the edges, " but that is not unusual for students learning to put the presentations together in an 8 to 10 week period. " He was polite. He was n't rude. He was n't not nice, " she said. He dressed normally, she said. When Holmes ' rotation ended, Gibson watched him walk out of the lab and " that was that. " She does n't remember much else. Gibson never felt that Holmes was detached form reality. 4:35 p.m. Defense attorney Rebekka Higgs cross examined Gibson. Gibson said her co worker had more interactions with Holmes than she did. Holmes did not appear to want to interact with people, she said. Many other students come into the lab want to discuss the details about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she was not sure if he was n't able to engage or if he " just did n't want to. " Gibson never asked him why he was behaving the way he did and he never told her that he was not interested in the material. Gibson and Holmes were in the lab together every day, but their one on one interactions were limited and focused on the work that was being done in the lab, she said. They did not interact on a social level. While working with Holmes, he answered with short, one word answers, Gibson said. He presented as " flat, " with little eye contact and few facial expressions. 4:42 p.m. Gibson said she saw a practice presentation Holmes gave, but did not help him put the presentation together. She perceived Holmes as a smart student, but noticed that there were things Holmes did not appear to understand basic things, she said. Sometimes it appeared as if Holmes was doing something for the first time, even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not surprise Gibson to have a quiet student rotate through the lab. Holmes was different because his interactions never increased. Gibson said she saw Holmes ' photo in the paper a few days after the shooting, during his first court appearance. When she saw that, she described him as being " bug eyed. " She said she 'd seen that same expression on Holmes ' face when he appeared confused in the lab. 4:53 p.m. The judge asked Gibson three questions submitted by the jury. Do you know what Holmes was looking at on his laptop? No, she said. When you referred to un engaging, do you mean that he did n't want to engage others or was not engaged with his work? " I felt as though he did n't want to engage with us generally or with the work, " she said. Can you explain the defendant 's facial features and hand gestures?
