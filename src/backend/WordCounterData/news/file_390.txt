3066541 <p> The Seminole Tribe of Florida fought the U.S. Army in the 1800s and resisted forced migration to Oklahoma. A century later, they rescued themselves from poverty by becoming the first tribe to venture into the gambling business. <p> Now is the time for an ambitious new challenge being the first American Indian tribe to buy a global company. <p> The Seminoles finished their $965 million purchase of Hard Rock International 's restaurants, hotels and related businesses from U.K.-based The Rank Group PLC on March 5. Its 3,300 members are now in the position to add to their already impressive wealth. <p> But the acquisition also speaks to something deeper, a respect for an ancestry of " unconquered warriors " whose kin are motivated by history and preserving their culture. <p> " I do n't think the measure of how much money comes in to the tribe is the benchmark, " tribe Vice Chairman Max Osceola said. " I think the measurement is what you do with it. Money only buys convenience. It does n't buy character. " <p> American Indian tribes are profiting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Seminoles became the first U.S. tribe to offer high-stakes gambling in 1979, when they opened a bingo hall in Hollywood, Fla. <p> The bingo hall survived several court challenges, and in 1988, Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which established federal regulatory authority and standards. <p> Since then, Indian gaming has greatly expanded. It generated $22.6 billion in revenue in 2005, up 14.6 percent from the previous year, according to the Indian Gaming Industry Report by Alan Meister, an economist with Analysis Group. <p> Florida 's tribes the Seminoles and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians placed sixth among the highest grossing states with more than $1.26 billion in revenue in 2005 up 36.1 percent from 2004, the study showed. <p> The Seminoles account for a large chunk of the state 's Indian gaming revenue, and 90 percent of their budget comes from gambling. They have seven casinos, including thriving Hard Rock Hotel and Casinos in Hollywood and Tampa. <p> Indian tribes do not pay corporate income taxes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Seminoles created a separate taxpaying corporation to own and manage Hard Rock that 's subject to public disclosures. <p> " Entering the commercial arena would require them to disclose more information that they already do and that 's a quantum leap for many tribes, " said David Katz, gaming and lodging analyst for CIBC World Markets. <p> The tribe 's likeliest move toward expanding Hard Rock will probably be into commercial markets where gambling is allowed, such as Atlantic City, Katz said. And Osceola said other gaming tribes have contacted the Seminoles to see if they can use the Hard Rock name at their facilities. <p> These moves have the potential to increase the tribe 's revenue, which would only mean more prosperity for its members. But where does all that money go? <p> The road cuts a winding path toward the north. Buzzards swoop down and pick at a carcass, forcing cars to swerve onto soft shoulders that give way to canals. Cows graze in the midmorning sun, as white egrets perch on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cypress trees, a reminder of the location Florida 's Everglades. <p> A sign welcomes motorists to the 35,000-acre Big Cypress Seminole Indian Reservation, established in 1936. <p> The Seminoles spent decades fighting the U.S. Army, and fled south to the Everglades to avoid the forced migration known as the Trail of Tears in 1830. President Tyler ordered the end of military actions against the Seminoles in May 1842, and the tribe never surrendered to the U.S. Army. <p> The Seminoles settled in the Everglades, and were mired in poverty for decades. Tribal elders recall days when they had to hunt their own food and lived without utilities. <p> The tribe sold tax-free tobacco products while also raising cattle and growing citrus. Still, it was gambling that significantly increased the members ' yearly dividend, which the tribe wo n't publicly discuss. The Associated Press reported in 2003 that each Seminole receives $42,000 a year before the two Florida Hard Rock hotels and casinos got off the ground. <p> At a glance, the Big Cypress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school and a day care, a gymnasium and a government building. <p> But there are also signals this is not a regular town. There 's a long airstrip, and a hangar holding a private jet and helicopters. Just east, next to an abandoned bingo hall, sits an air conditioned tent housing about 40-plus slot machines. A tourist attraction allows visitors to see alligator wrestling and journey through the Everglades on airboats and swamp buggies. <p> This reservation and others in the state are the final destinations for the tribe 's money. They govern themselves and pay for health services, education, housing and public safety with a combination of tribal money and federal assistance. But the federal involvement also leads to frequent clashes with the government. <p> " Today we do n't have military wars, but we have to fight what I call paper bullets, " Osceola said. <p> Terry Porter is principal at the Ahfachkee School, where about 150 students from kindergarten through 12th grade learn reading, writing, math, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held outside under chickee huts, where students plant crops, weave clothing, cook and learn other tasks that fall into the Seminole tradition. <p> About 20 percent of the school 's funding comes from the federal Bureau of Indian Education, with the rest coming from the Seminoles. The school is getting two new portable classrooms because of an expected rise in enrollment. <p> Porter, 42, says the students are receptive to learning about the culture, but it 's a challenge in an era where technology and media pervade everyday life. <p> " It 's real important that we do help our children step into that modern world, but at the same time try to help them understand to never forget where you came from, never forget what your people went through to get you where you 're at today, " Porter said. <p> " It 's hard though because a lot of these children will not know some of those hard times, " he added. " It 's kind of like getting this inheritance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who know what it was like to say, I remember when the tribe was really struggling to stay afloat. ' " <p> Down the road from the school is a construction site for a new public safety building, and improvements are planned at the reservation 's entertainment complex. <p> There 's also a museum, a historical preservation office and archive of Seminole cultural artifacts, which are carefully overseen by Tina Osceola, a tribe member who lives in Naples and is not related to the tribal leader. <p> She is considered a rising star in the tribe, which is seeking qualified members to lead its future business efforts. She says the tribe 's culture is not disappearing with its growing wealth, but it 's the responsibility of the membership to pass along the meaning of Seminole life to members who may not have a historical perspective. <p> " Compartmentalizing who a Seminole is, to where you have to be traditional or modern, or full-blood or half-breed, or whatever those labels are, is damaging, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at not doing that to our own people by saying, You were n't raised with us, you do n't know what its like to be a Seminole. ' " <p> However, with such evolution and wealth come certain dangers. For instance, she sees a time when the reservation will have homes in gated communities, to keep crime out. <p> Max Osceola, meanwhile, said some members told him they removed tribal stickers from their cars, citing instances where motorists tried to run them off the road. <p> " There are a lot of prejudiced people in the world who hate Seminoles already, " Max Osceola said, citing what he feels is jealousy over the tribe 's wealth and Hard Rock purchase " that will just add fuel to the fire. " <p> Still, some members say the tribe 's success has created a renewed sense of pride, an entire tribe saying it 's their time to become fully self-sufficient and control their own future. <p> When the Hard Rock deal was first announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our ancestors sold Manhattan for trinkets. Today, with the acquisition of the Hard Rock Cafe, we 're going to buy Manhattan back one hamburger at a time. " <p> Months later, that sentiment remains strong, at least from Tina Osceola 's perspective. <p> " You could sit and talk to a group of kids and they 're going to have that same mentality that Max has... and that 's that ' We 're Seminole, we survived against all odds, and screw you if you do n't like it, ' " she said. " That is an overriding sentiment that goes above all else. "
