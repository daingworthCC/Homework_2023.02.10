4114341 The sluggish national economy has yet to put the brakes on the growth of The Woodlands, as evidenced by continued progress in residential and office development as well as international interest. # " We saw the recession, but we are once again seeing an uptick in new home sales. A boom in the energy sector is also driving growth, " said Alex Sutton, co-president of The Woodlands Development Corp. # He points to the upsurge in new homes sales as one piece of evidence demonstrating a strong local economy. # Sutton noted that in 2005 there were 1,515 new homes sold in The Woodlands. There were 1,409 sold in 2006. The number dropped to 767 in 2007 and 750 in 2008 and then fell to 633 in 2009. The number crept up to 786 in 2010 and rebounded to 945 for 2011. # " A large portion of the new home sales are taking place to buyers moving in from outside the area, " Sutton said. Many of these new residents are coming from places like California. # Sutton attributes this to Texas friendlier business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Houston Intercontinental Chamber of Commerce president Reggie Gray agrees. " Places like California have so many hurdles, whereas our area does not. Texas has been tops in Forbes Magazine, for instance, noted as a business-friendly environment, " he said. # In 2009, 33 percent of new home sales in The Woodlands were made to people relocating from places outside the Houston region. That number rose to 46 percent in 2011, Sutton said. # " We do know people are coming here for the energy business and energy industry support companies, " he said, pointing as most business leaders do to the construction of the 385-acre Exxon Mobil Corp. campus near Interstate 45 at the Harris and Montgomery counties line. # Susan Vreeland-Wendt, director of marketing for The Woodlands Development Corp., said typical of the area 's residential growth is progress being made in the newest and ninth village of The Woodlands, Creekside Park. # " More than 1,700 housing units have been sold so far. Over the next several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes) will be built along with a village center, " she said. # She also pointed to the development of Liberty Branch, located inside Creekside Park. Around 400 home starts are expected by late summer or early fall of this year with the first homes coming online in the spring of 2013. # Sutton noted that phase one of the Millennium Waterway Apartments has also been completed and 90 percent of the 393 units are currently occupied. He said plans are in the works for phase two, which he anticipates will be about the same size and scope. # He also noted that 90 percent of the 207 units of the Village at The Woodlands senior assisted-living development have been leased as well. # Noteworthy among the growth rate of people moving in from out of the area is the increased interest shown by Mexican and other Latin American business men and women. # Gray said his chamber has already made three trips to places such as Guadalajara, Mexico and Los Angeles to promote the north Houston area to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woodlands is almost becoming a legend in Mexico because of its great family style and the business-friendly environment, " he said. # Emilio Aragon of the Hispanic Business Center said, " The Woodlands is a great area to live. Many Latin American businessmen are coming here to find a better quality of life. " # Karen Hoylman, president of the South Montgomery County Woodlands Chamber of Commerce agrees, " In the past we have been a popular vacation place for Latin American visitors. But our area is becoming even more popular as a place to do business because of the stress being experienced in Mexico, " she said. # Though specific statistics on how many Latin American families and business are relocating to The Woodlands is unavailable, Sutton says, " You only need to come out here and see we are acquiring an increasing number of foreign nationals. " He said a person might hear a number of languages being spoken when visiting a grocery store or other public places these days. # Sutton highlighted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on office development in The Waterway Square District. # Leases have been signed or negotiations are under way for space on the first seven to eight floors of the nine-story 3 Waterway office building. Sutton said the Development Corp., may be looking at 11 floors when the building is completed. # The nine-story, 216,000-square-foot, 4 Waterway office building is fully leased. # " With the demand for office space as it is, we are looking at developing our next building. It would likely be another 200,000- square-foot building and would be located across the street from the 3 and 4 Waterway buildings, " Sutton said. # Hoylman highlighted Anadarko Petroleum 's work on a 31-story, 550,000-square-foot office building as evidence of economic strength as well. The building is next to the company 's current headquarters and on land it owns at the corner of Woodloch Forest Drive and Lake Robbins Drive. Construction should be completed around spring 2014. # The South Montgomery County Woodlands Economic Development Partnership reports that 68,000 people lived in The Woodlands in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2010 and is expected to climb to 114,775 by 2015. # There were 247,120 people within a 10-mile radius of The Woodlands in 2000 and 400,368 in 2010.
