3048041 <p> When Frank Jordan announced his candidacy for mayor four years ago this month, San Franciscans knew him as a mild-mannered ex-police chief who had absolutely no experience in the rough and tumble world of city politics. <p> Campaigning as a citizen politician, Jordan made a virtue of his lack of political experience and pulled off an upset over then-Mayor Art Agnos with a steady drumbeat of attacks on the incumbent 's record. Now, four years later, it is Jordan who will be forced to defend his record as potential rivals gear up for what is likely to be a wild and wide-open race for mayor. <p> Looking forward to the campaign for the November election, Jordan, a Democrat, recently sat down with The Chronicle 's editorial board to discuss the political challenges he faces. With unusual candor, he discussed the field of candidates who are eyeing his job and some broader policy problems he faces, both in the city and as a result of Republicans capturing control of Congress. What follows is an edited transcript of that discussion. <p>. <p> Q. : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have on San Francisco? <p> A : This " Contract With America " is a serious issue because the first item is that they want to take over and assume control of Hetch Hetchy and take $ 25 million a year for the next five years, which would be $ 125 million of revenue from Hetch Hetchy that goes into our general fund every year. <p> We see this as just the opposite of what the Republican Party stands for. We do n't nationalize programs( that run excellently) at local levels and create a bigger bureaucracy and wind up having everybody pay more money, whether it 's taxes or water bills or power bills or whatever. We 're working with our own elected officials back in Washington, D.C., but we feel also we 've got to work with the Republicans in the region. <p> This is our opportunity to start bringing some coalitions together. We 're going to talk with George Schultz and Caspar Weinberger. Anybody we think might have some tie-in to the Republican Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are of San Francisco losing on Hetch Hetchy? <p> A : The danger is that it 's the first 100 days that they 're ramrodding things through. I 'm hoping that between all the people who are trying to build a coalition with( the Republicans), we 'll at least have enough information back there to them in the Congress. <p> The U.S. conference of mayors is the last week of January. I 'll be back in Washington and Newt Gingrich and Robert Dole will be there. We 're trying to get some of these Republicans to attend a meeting so that all this information will be made available to them. <p> Q : How serious do you think the Hetch Hetchy problem is? <p> A : What bothers me is it 's the No. 1 item on the list. Their feeling is that they want to use this money to balance the federal budget. And I fear( what might happen to) the Presidio. <p> Q : How much of a problem was caused by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : We call that a shot over our bow. I guess the thing was they 're moving out four years earlier because there is an unhappiness with San Francisco and the way we do things here.( It may be related to San Francisco being) anti-military or closing the bases, and that we seem to be going left when the country 's going right. <p> My concern is that somehow it 's easy to say, " Just forget about San Francisco. We do n't have to worry about them. Let 's just tell them that there 's a change in the country and maybe they should join us for a change. " <p> Q : How do you foresee your relationship changing with the board of supervisors? <p> A : In my State of the City address, I threw the olive branch out there and said that really what I want to do is work with you, communicate, sit down and have some good open discussion, healthy debate, differences of opinion. But let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other. Let 's not get into special interest groups ; let 's find some solutions, so that San Francisco 's a winner. <p> I thought it came across, and I shook hands with everybody after it was over, and then about three hours later one of the first things that happened was the override of my veto immediately on the hotel strike issue, which I personally feel is a mistake. If there 's going to be a strike or any kind of a demonstration outside the front of a hotel, we 're supposed to notify the Convention and Visitor 's Bureau, let everybody know that there 's a problem and there could be disruptions and that maybe you should n't come here. <p> That is not the message we should be giving out. We 're supposed to be working with those unions and finding a way to bring them in and settle those strikes if we can, but at least work with them and communicate and also showcase San Francisco in its best possible light. Bring people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll come back again or stay longer. <p> Q : Do you think the board represents the ideological diversity of the city? <p> A : I 've had some concerns. Maybe it was just psychological, but I was standing up there addressing the board, and to the left side it was interesting to see Sue Bierman, Tom Ammiano and Mabel Teng and Carole Migden and Terence Hallinan. They 're all on the liberal side. And it 's like they 're all working together and they talk to each other and work together very easily now. <p> Q : How many of them are running against you? <p> A : Probably at least two. Carole Migden probably and maybe Terence Hallinan too, which kind of surprises me, but so be it. <p> Q : You left out Angela Alioto. <p> A : Angela has been running for three years, so I know exactly where she 's coming from and what she 's attempting to do. There again, I hope she does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nice to have her in the race. Let her speak her mind and say what she wants, and let the facts speak for themselves. <p> My concern is that there is such damage there that I do n't know how it 's all going to hold up. Can she handle the race and stay in it until it 's over? It 's hard to say. <p> There are still others. There 's still the possibility of Quentin Kopp, who keeps talking about it. There 's a possibility of( City Attorney) Louise Renne running ; they 're out there testing the water. Of course I have concerns about Louise because of the people she 's hired in the past six months. She has a tremendous number of people( in her office) who are politically astute but not so much city attorneys. She 's building a team in there that is much more( prepared) for a campaign than it is for settling law cases. <p> Q : Is that a problem for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 'm going to do is watch it closely. The problem for me is that I see this as a conflict if it gets any worse, because I have to rely on the city attorney 's judgment on everything I do. If she 's going to run against me or is showing signs of attempting to do so, I 'm going to have to say -- and I think soon -- that I 'd rather have her make her decision early. If she wants to run for mayor, go ahead and run, but do n't put me in a position where I do n't feel comfortable with the decisions that could come out of that office. <p> Q : You 've not had that conversation with her? <p> A : Not yet. I think I will, sometime in February. I think we should get it out in the open and deal with it. I wo n't feel comfortable if I sense that she 's building a team and working out issues that could be controversial, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get things done. <p> Q : What about Art Agnos? Do you see any problems of a similar nature with him sitting in the Housing and Urban Development office? <p> A : It could be. There again I see problems because of communication. I have discussed this with( U.S. Housing Secretary) Henry Cisneros. I said to him that this is a very difficult position for me to be in, to have a mayor that I ran against and defeated and then have him as the regional head of HUD. I 'm talking about all the housing and homeless programs and all the grants that we 're dealing with that have to go through him to get to Henry Cisneros. <p> Two years ago, when I saw some of the lack of communication and missed meetings, all of a sudden I find out that Henry Cisneros is in San Francisco and I did n't even know about it because Agnos had the information and did n't tell me. I said I 've got to have better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time you have any problem you call me directly. And I 've done that a few times. <p> I even took a team back to his office in Washington to make sure he understood the Matrix Program, as an example, or my homeless policy or what we 've done with nonprofits, because he had the wrong information back there. He had it that we were a disaster in San Francisco, but when he heard our team he was very impressed and said, hell, this is the model I want for the rest of the country. <p> Q : How close are you on a decision on a chief administrative officer? <p> A : I hope to get that resolved no later than the second week of February. I want to do that because, again, I 'm getting people coming in from everywhere. Some of them are people I ca n't even believe would ask. Some people who are in different agencies of city government and lower-level positions, others who are in the political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there. I do n't want to politicize it, number one. I want to get a good, solid, professional administrator who can work with the board of supervisors. <p> Q : How many serious candidates are there for that post? <p> A : Maybe four or five. But I would not rule out somebody who may do it on an interim basis. The point would be I 'd rather have long-term, but if I sense that I need someone to get me into charter reform and get it done over a year or two, then that 'll happen too. The danger of that is that I have to anticipate winning, <p> Q : When you ran four years ago, your strategy was, obviously, to attack the record of the incumbent. Now you 're in the opposite position. How has your perspective changed as you think back to that campaign? <p> A : I remember everyone attacked Art Agnos because he was the incumbent, so I expect that 's what 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focal point and they 'll be attacking me on my policies, on what I did or did n't do. Although if Art Agnos runs again I feel much more comfortable this time than I did last time, to be honest with you, because my feeling is that he left me a record that I had to deal with. <p> I can give three examples : One would be he told me and everybody else that we 'd have an $ 80 million deficit when the race was over, and when I walked in the door it was $ 300 million. <p> There 's a lot of reasons for that but some of it I can easily talk about : You ca n't have a pay freeze for every city employee and then have built into the system a double pay raise the next year -- whoever the next mayor is has to deal with two raises rather than one. And in order to get all the unions to agree to it you throw in a $ 15 million dental plan. That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was fair. The package should have been out there so everybody knew exactly what we were dealing with. <p> Another one : Just look outside City Hall and make the comparison between Camp Agnos in the Civic Center Plaza and what 's there now. <p> And the third one is public safety, which I think was one of the things that helped me win. I remember during the campaign a demonstration went down Market Street to the State Building. Agnos had property damage along the way, windows smashed at the State Building, arson inside, and he did n't have one arrest by any police officer. The next day I jumped all over Agnos about that and he had to look at the newspapers. He had the police department look at the newspapers to see who they would arrest as a follow-up. <p> That, to me, is the wrong message to send out. You 've got to have something in place that shows that, sure, you can demonstrate, sure, you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't trample on everybody else 's first amendment rights and not expect anything to happen. There 's got to be some setting of a tone there. <p> Q : How much confidence do you have in Chief Ribera? <p> A : To be determined. I like Tony Ribera. He did what I 've asked him to do. I told him to get into the hard-core crime, to look at the crime rates, to look at what we need to do with career criminals and parole violators, and he has a good record on these things the past couple years. <p> We 're the city( that 's done the best job) in the state, for that matter in the whole country -- even the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times are giving us credit -- dropping the crime rate in the last two years. <p> I have some concerns about some of the latest issues, issues that often fester in these sexual harassment cases. I do n't think that when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you draw the line?( A second woman has come forward recently with charges that she was sexually harassed by Ribera 20 years ago.) Anybody can make any kind of a statement, and pretty soon you 're out there defending and chasing ghosts and shadows of 20 years ' duration. Why did n't this surface 20 years ago? Fifteen years ago? Five years ago? How do you even begin to defend yourself in a situation like this? <p> So I have concerns because that 's not good. It 's a disruption in the police department, it 's a disruption for me. So I just have to try to do what I think best. As a former chief of police, I wonder, do we have all the facts? Let 's deal with the facts and not get into all these perceptions and politics and cut somebody adrift because of what somebody says happened 20 years ago. I want to give them a fair shake.
