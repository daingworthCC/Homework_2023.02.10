3050541 <p> By now, the 13 sailors on the Illbruck Challenge have settled into their spartan diet of mushy, freeze-dried food. But sailing in tight quarters in heavy seas for weeks at a time is both physically and mentally exhausting. Relentless waves pound so hard against the boat 's synthetic hull the crew often has trouble sleeping. <p> San Francisco 's John Kostecki skippers the 60-foot German yacht in the Volvo Ocean Race - often described as the Mount Everest of sailboat racing. As a rookie, he won a silver medal for the United States in the Soling class keelboat at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, Korea. In recent America 's Cup competitions, he has garnered a reputation as one of the world 's finest sailing tacticians. A victory in the Volvo Ocean Race would secure the 37-year-old sailor 's position in the pantheon of blue-water skippers. <p> " I 'm a very competitive person, " Kostecki said during a series of interviews before the start of the nine-month long race. " This is one of the premier races in our sport. It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " <p> Kostecki 's all-male crew shares an intense desire to win. There are five Kiwis, an Australian, a Spaniard, a German, a Brit, a Dutchman and a Canadian. They communicate in English. Several have sailed in one or more previous Whitbread ' Round the World races( the Volvo Ocean Race 's former name). <p> " We slowly built the team, " Kostecki said. " We made sure that everybody that was on the team agreed with the next person chosen. It 's a long, difficult, strenuous race and you really have to be able to get along in difficult conditions. " <p> Fifteen sailors on the Challenge 's shore team will refurbish the boat at various ports along the way, including stops at Miami and Baltimore. <p> Kostecki is known for his calm, cool manner, but concedes that he had to focus in the last year on his people skills to become a better leader. <p> " Our philosophy is that everyone is basically equal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said. " You go out with the team, have a few drinks. Every once in while you have to do that and let loose. It helps with the camaraderie.... <p> " It 's pretty rare that I have to talk to them as a skipper, " he said. " You have to have a leader and a pecking order just in case something goes wrong, terribly wrong, and also for foresight, when you have to think a few steps ahead. " <p> The 32,700-nautical mile Volvo Ocean Race is the ultimate test for skipper and crew. It includes nine oceangoing legs, with ports of call on five continents. There are two major crossings of the Southern Ocean, which has the Earth 's biggest waves, howling gale-force winds, freezing temperatures and icebergs. It 's not uncommon for these lightweight sleds with huge sails to surf down the face of 40-foot waves. <p> Even so, Kostecki -does n't consider himself an extreme risk-taker. " I 'm more of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Number One rule is safety first. " <p> Some of the biggest sailing scares he 's encountered have been health-related. When he last competed in the event, a fungus growth on Kostecki 's legs became infected with open sores and he broke out in hives. Luckily, his boat 's medical kit contained an antibiotic strong enough to cure the problem. On a training voyage off the East Coast last spring, Kostecki 's bowman Tony Kolb fell on board and gashed his neck. He had to be taken away by a Coast Guard cutter. <p> Then there are the moments of unparalleled beauty. <p> " You get away from civilization, " Kostecki said. " When you get locked into your normal routine on land, you have to deal with millions of other people, cars and pollution. It 's a real simple life out on the ocean. Everybody on board has grown up sailing. It 's enjoyable and fun - and it 's a natural feeling. I like physically demanding outdoor sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding my bike or on my snowboard. " <p> ' Round the world in nine months <p> Eight high-tech racing machines set out from Southampton, England, on Sept. 23 on the first leg of the around-the-world voyage. Kostecki is a front-runner. So far, he has lived up to expectations that his well-financed, well-prepared syndicate will be tough to beat. But ocean racing is highly unpredictable. <p> Soon after crossing the starting line, Amer Sports One - skippered by Grant Dalton, the Kiwi who won an around-the-world catamaran race earlier this year - grabbed the lead. Kostecki 's new boat, the Illbruck Challenge, was in the middle of the pack, along with Amer Sports Too, whose all-women crew includes Melissa Purdy of Belvedere. <p> During four weeks of breakneck racing, Kostecki patiently hunted down the leaders, then led the pack through the doldrums near the Equator. Dalton retook the lead, and the fleet made its way through severe headwinds and steep seas toward the South African coast. Crews donned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sailboats. The trailing yachts were forced to ration their food supplies. Kostecki staged a come-from-behind victory, arriving first in Cape Town after 31 days at sea. Dalton finished second, only two hours later. <p> " This has given our team the confidence not only that we are a major contender in this Volvo Ocean Race, but we can fight back when it gets tough, " said Kostecki, who chalked up his Leg 1 victory to " flawless crew work. " He lost 14 pounds during the marathon sail. <p> The second leg across the hazardous Southern Ocean from Cape Town to Sydney, Australia, is considered the most grueling. Kostecki 's boat had a rough start. Heading south past the Cape of Good Hope, the Illbruck Challenge became sluggish and the bow dipped dangerously below the waves. Water had poured into the bright green hull from a small inspection hatch that was left open. By the time the problem was fixed, the boat had fallen behind 20 miles. <p> Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to Cape Town due to a failed rudder. Two weeks later, Kostecki and four other skippers were battling for the lead. <p> All eight yachts competing in the Volvo Ocean Race have similar designs. The Illbruck Challenge is made of Kevlar, an ultra-strong yet lightweight material used in bulletproof vests. The mast is carbon fiber. Its aerodynamically shaped sails have been designed to increase boat speed. <p> There is a tiny cabin below deck, with pipe-shape berths for sleeping. There 's a sink, but no shower. " It 's tight living, " Kostecki said. " You 're right next to somebody at all times, whether you 're on deck or eating a meal.... There 's no way to get up and escape. " <p> The making of a sailor <p> Kostecki was born in Pittsburgh, Pa. When he was 2, his parents moved to the Marin town of Terra Linda. A year later, his father, a chemical engineer, and his mother, a nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started racing with them. They really got into the sport, " he said. " When I was 8 years old, I joined a junior sailing program at Richmond Yacht Club. I went through that program every winter until I was 18, getting into bigger and bigger boats. I loved it. From early on, I liked being out on the water. Once I started racing, I thrived on the competition, " he said. " I have a natural feeling for boats and making them go fast. I also enjoy the challenge of big teams and organizing a team. " <p> Kostecki played soccer and ran track at Novato High, but sailing commanded much of his time. Skippering a J24-class boat, his team won the Sears Cup, a national championship for junior sailors. <p> For the past 13 years, Kostecki has made a living as a professional sailor. " It definitely has taken its toll on relationships, " said the bachelor, who spends a lot of time away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique balance. You have to work on it. " <p> Kostecki was skipper of Chessie Racing in six of nine legs of the last Whitbread Race in 199798. He was also the navigator for America One, the San Francisco team that reached the challenger finals in the 2000 America 's Cup. He credits AmericaOne skipper Paul Cayard with teaching him a lot about managing a team. <p> Kostecki currently oversees a budget of some $18 million for the Volvo Ocean Race, which includes money for crew salaries as well as boat building, extensive sail testing, on-the-water training and repairs. <p> " I find sailing challenging because there are so many variables involved compared with other sports, " Kostecki said. " You 're dealing with so many elements that can change rapidly : sea states, currents, wind... so to be successful in our sport it really comes down to minimizing your risk in all these variables and making the least amount of mistakes. " <p> Unlike many other sports, there are no set time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many middle-age men and women compete in world-class sailing events. <p> " Sailing has been a lifelong passion for me, " he said. " I love it, and I love the competition. And I hope I have this type of life for a long time.... " <p> Today 's sailing audience <p> Sailboat racing -does n't have much of a fan-base in America, but in Europe it 's a mainstream sport with its own celebrities and media limelight. <p> " It 's difficult to bring spectators out on the water, " Kostecki said. " In the Volvo Race, our arena is the middle of the ocean. But I think with the Internet and the advancement of technology that we 're slowly able to bring sailboat racing to the general public. So I think we 'll find that our sport will be becoming more popular. " <p> Volvo Ocean Race updates are posted on the Internet at www.VolvoOceanRace.org, along with skippers ' log notes, still photos and video images. The sports channel ESPN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Kostecki 's affiliation with Illbruck, a German manufacturer of household fixtures, auto parts and industrial products, began in 1994 when he was sailing in the world Star-boat championships in Germany. Kostecki met and sailed with the late Willy Illbruck, who hired him a year later to skipper one of his yachts, Pinta, on the European racing circuit. <p> " We had the same philosophy on winning races, " Kostecki said. " I 've been involved with the company and sailing program ever since.... We have great support from the company and great people supporting the sailing team. " <p> Two years ago, Illbruck Challenge purchased Cayard 's winning boat, EF Language, from the previous Whitbread Race, and its sister vessel, EF Education. The team began two-boat testing to determine how changes in hull and sail shape might be incorporated into its design for a new boat. <p> Kostecki 's team spent 18 months training off the coast of Spain, the Eastern Seaboard and in the Southern Ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossing - testing their new boat in rough waters, trying out new navigational software and working on long-distance race strategies. And they competed in the Sydney-Hobart Race in Australia and the Fastnet Race across the Irish Sea. <p> " The new boat is quite strong, " Kostecki said after this summer 's Fastnet, in which his team traded the lead several times with winner Team News Corp., before finally taking second. " It 's pretty fast and solid and hopefully it 's going to get us around the world in one piece and across the finish line in first place. " <p> Because the Illbruck Challenge syndicate is planning a run for the America 's Cup next year in New Zealand, Kostecki 's design team in Germany is already running wind-tunnel and water tests of prototype models to create a sleek, 75-foot racer. <p> The eight syndicates vying in the Volvo Ocean Race include Assa Abloy, a Swedish boat with San Francisco sailor Mark Rudiger as co-skipper and navigator, which finished Leg 1 in fifth place. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sayonara, the winning yacht in the 1998 Sydney-Hobart Race in which six sailors on other boats died in a storm. <p> The Volvo Ocean Race 's first leg to Cape Town was the longest - an 8,000-mile journey. The fleet worked its way southward to the fickle winds of the doldrums, before encountering the trade winds off Africa and the wicked fronts of the Southern Ocean. <p> Shortly after rounding the tiny island of Trinidade off the Brazilian coast, Dalton - whose boat was in fifth place - anticipated a wind shift and took the lead from Kostecki. <p> The two contenders raced ahead of an approaching storm front. For eight days, it looked like Dalton 's Amer Sports One would run away with the race, but he was never able to shake Kostecki from his stern. As the wind increased, Kostecki 's well-tuned boat ate away at Dalton 's lead. With 36 hours of sailing left, the Illbruck Challenge recaptured the lead and held fast during a 500-mile sprint to Cape Town. <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members returned to the gym to prepare for the next leg. " I think it 's going to be a tough, tight race because all the boats will be fairly equal in speed, " said Kostecki. " So it will come down to who sails the best, and that 's the way it should be.
