4132641 World 's fairs exist to provide a glimpse into the future. They showcase technological breakthroughs like the telephone introduced at the 1876 Philadelphia exposition and the diesel engine that chugged along at the Paris fair in 1900, powered by peanut oil, of all things. Fairs also anticipate social utopias through dreamy, aspirational slogans like " Peace Through Understanding, " the theme of the New York World 's Fair in 1964-65, and " Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life, " for Expo Milano 2015 in Milan. Many of the gadgets and doohickeys swiftly become parts of everyday life, though peace, understanding and other heralded signs of social progress remain limited. As for the fairs themselves, sometimes host cities get it right, but the ironic truth is that planners often have a myopic, short-term focus that causes sites to age poorly after the crowds leave. " They do n't think through the whole legacy question, " Robert Rydell, a history professor at Montana State University, said of some fair organizers. " Modern fairs do a lot of planning on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The legacies they do leave range from the tragic to the trippy, with an occasionally successful effort at transforming the host city. Little remains of the 1851 Great Exhibition, held in London 's Hyde Park and considered the first modern world 's fair, other than the name of a mediocre team in England 's top soccer league : Crystal Palace. The original Crystal Palace was a huge glass-and-iron structure that housed the exhibition. Although widely embraced by the British public, the structure was moved after the fair closed to a dreary neighborhood south of the Thames, near where the team plays, and was destroyed in a fire in 1936. The years have been kinder to another 19th-century relic, the gateway arch to the 1889 Universal Exposition in Paris, despite being demonized before it was built. A group of French artists, authors and architects called the arch " useless and monstrous " and predicted that it would be " a giddy, ridiculous tower dominating Paris like a gigantic black smokestack. " They had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, you 've probably noticed that the arch, the Eiffel Tower, is still there. The city that may have benefited most from its world 's fair, because planners conceived it as an engine for urban renewal, not an end in itself, is Seattle. An indication of how well the 1962 fair site was incorporated into the modern city is that many people do n't realize that a fair was held there. " The Century 21 Exposition in Seattle is an excellent example of a site that some know was a world 's fair site but others do n't, " said Jennifer Minner, an assistant professor of land-use planning at Cornell University who has studied the impact of world 's fairs on host cities. Remnants of the fair are hiding in plain sight, including the Space Needle -- " this icon that 's analogous with Seattle itself, " Ms. Minner called it -- along with a monorail that snakes through a portion of downtown and the " Space Age gothic " United States Pavilion that was converted into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge impact on Seattle, " Ms. Minner said. The organizers " saw this as an opportunity to highlight the importance of the city and to revitalize downtown. Even if all of their intentions were not immediately realized, Seattle is recognized as an important place to go. " Many cities built fairs with the intention of sprucing up rundown parts of town, Ms. Minner said, but have far less to show for it. They emphasized getting rid of the old but were less diligent about replacing it with something new. Fair plans " are often utopian, but there 's a darker side, " she said. " In some cases there 's a vision for wiping away what 's there and putting something in its place that 's better for the business community or a better civic center, and there 's been a real cost to that. " In San Antonio in 1968, for instance, there was " a displacement of neighborhoods that were there before, " she said. Shanghai suffered a similar fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in beneficial, if eccentric, ways. Hollywood has embraced the odd extemporaneousness of the 1964-65 New York fair. In a crucial, scenery-chewing role, the New York State Pavilion portrayed an alien spaceship in the 1997 comedy " Men in Black. " More than a decade later the site in suburban Queens featured in the climactic scene of another science-fiction hit, " Iron Man 2. " Financial records for fairs are hard to come by, but New York was considered a substantial loser, Ms. Minner said, because of extravagances born of the excessive ambitions of the organizer, the urban planner Robert Moses. The Seattle fair, successful in other ways, is thought to have turned a profit. Moving further back in time, historians record that the 1893 World 's Columbian Exposition in Chicago lost money, though a handsome return on an attraction introduced there -- the Ferris wheel -- saved the fair from bankruptcy. No saving was needed for the 1851 Great Exhibition. The Bureau International des Expositions, the organization that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the London event cost 336,000( about $1.6 million at the time) and took in 522,000. London and Seattle are more exceptions than the rule. " If you simply look at gate receipts and bottom lines, most of these things have lost money, " said Mr. Rydell of Montana State University. It is difficult to assess the true costs and benefits of a world 's fair because money is often spent on civic improvements that are not part of the fair but occur coincidentally. The fairs provide a good excuse to upgrade transportation, power and communications systems and build parks, museums and other cultural facilities. " Many fairs have succeeded on those accounts, " Mr. Rydell said. Expo Milano 2015 has been the catalyst for a construction boom in and around its host city. " Milan is experiencing a season of great economic and social upswing " in conjunction with the event, said Ada Lucia De Cesaris, the city 's deputy mayor for urban planning. The exposition has " surely reinforced " development across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it " can not be considered its sole driver. " An express highway has been built between the city center and Expo Milano, which sits on disused industrial land about 10 miles northwest of Milan, and a new subway line connects northeastern neighborhoods to the main line that runs to the fair, said Lorenzo Kihlgren Grandi, a spokesman for the city government. All told, organizers estimate that 60,000 jobs will have been created directly and indirectly from the expo. It 's far too early to assess the impact of Expo Milano 2015 on Milan, but Ms. Minner would remind planners there and in other host cities to take the long view. " Have a 50-to-100-year vision of what the site will become, " she said. " A fair can be very disruptive to the tissue of a city, but it can also leave this incredible legacy. "
