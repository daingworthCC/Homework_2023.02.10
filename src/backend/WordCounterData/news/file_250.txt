3046141 <p> The plan involved putting a spread of unemployed welfare clients before companies eager to hire. <p> So invitations went out requesting the honor of employers ' presence at the welfare overhaul table. With more than 900 job openings, 58 companies from throughout the metro area came to get their fill through The Atlanta Project 's( TAP) welfare-to-work initiative. <p> The numbers suggest those employers wo n't be satisfied for a while. Of the 1,278 people referred from welfare offices to the participating businesses in 1997, only 154 were hired. And what has become clear is that the people left on metro-area welfare rolls are those who will be hardest to place in jobs because they have no work experience, few skills or have substance abuse problems. <p> Georgia 's welfare rolls dropped drastically during the past three years, with nearly 30,000 adults leaving the system in the last fiscal year alone. And in metro counties, where work programs started two years ago, the supply of skilled people diminished quickly. <p> " The people that have( skills) and could get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peters, interim director of the Division of Family and Children Services, the agency that administers welfare benefits. " Now the ones that are still out there -- we need to find out why are they there. " <p> TAP became involved in welfare employment efforts as part of its mission to combat poverty in the metro area. It solicited the help of business leaders in its effort because welfare recipients must find work under new federal legislation. <p> Because overhauling welfare and putting people to work will require assistance from businesses, some metro-area chambers of commerce have encouraged their members to provide job opportunities and training programs. However, those informal arrangements do n't track hires and job openings the way TAP does. <p> TAP acts as a liaison between businesses that need workers, and DFACS, which is supposed to prepare clients for work with the assistance of state education programs. TAP heard from employers about why they hired fewer people than they had intended. <p> " It 's a combination of a lot of things, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiative. " Many do n't show up( for interviews). Many who do, fail the drug screen or do n't meet the job qualifications. One of the problems is that many clients being referred( by DFACS) are in job search without the necessary screening. " <p> A number of employers think it is DFACS ' responsibility to equip welfare recipients with job skills and acceptable work habits -- and indeed it is. But some companies that are TAP partners are willing to train and mentor employees themselves. <p> H.J. Russell &; Company, an Atlanta-based general construction company, expected its applicants to be work-ready. The company set up a dozen interviews for 12 job openings for welfare clients, but half of them did not show up, and some failed the required drug tests, said R.K. Seghal, the company 's chief executive officer. <p> " But I 'm still interested, " he said. " I think it 's a worthwhile program and a marvelous opportunity. In getting the welfare recipient from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps missing. Maybe they( caseworkers) need to drive them, but they need to understand the essential part is people have to show up when they make appointments. " <p> DFACS has a plan to address each of those problems, Peters said. As for screening, caseworkers are in a second round of training to help them determine who is ready to look for work and who is n't. Being literate and having held a job before wo n't be enough to send someone knocking on an employer 's door. <p> Lowndes County is testing a questionnaire that will help alert caseworkers to a welfare client 's current or previous drug use. That information will allow the caseworker to divert someone on the dole to drug treatment before they go job hunting. DFACS has $ 1.5 million in its supplemental budget targeted for drug abuse treatment, Peters said. <p> With those measures, as well as training programs at the Department of Technical and Adult Education, DFACS hopes to see the 12 percent hiring rate in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can do better, " Peters said. " It 's that we must do better. It 's the role of the department to help these people, and we 've got four years to do it " before they are no longer eligible for welfare benefits. <p> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has taken on the responsibility itself, rather than waiting for DFACS to train workers. It established a special orientation and training program for its welfare hires and plans to create a remedial on-site English program to improve its newest employees ' reading and speaking skills. <p> " One of the things we realized is that you ca n't just hire, " said Karen Groux, the CDC 's welfare-to-work coordinator. " You have to have extensive mentoring so they can be successful. " <p> Each new hire has an assigned mentor who went through a mentoring course. Of last year 's 53 welfare hires, each of whom started earning almost $ 14,000 a year, only two did n't work out, Groux said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply would n't come to work. <p> But even in the latter 's case, the CDC tried to retain her. " We referred her to the employee assistance program and counseling, but she just would n't come to work, " Groux said. " We expected there would be a learning curve and a few humps to get over, so we are making really special efforts. " <p> As a federal agency, the CDC is committed to President Clinton 's directive for government bodies to participate in the welfare-to-work effort, she said. <p> UPS has hired almost 300 former welfare recipients in Georgia in full- and part-time positions. Even part-time employees receive full benefits, including medical, dental, prescriptions, retirement and stock purchase options, said Kerry Benedetto, UPS community relations manager. And UPS has approached MARTA about changing bus schedules and routes to accommodate its new employees. <p> Susan Miller, a former welfare client, began working part time at UPS in 1996. She trains new employees now, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first days were like. <p> " I thought this would n't work, " said Miller, 22, who lives in DeKalb County with her son and two daughters. " It was strenuous. Every day was a motivation thing. But it 's a good company, and there 's benefits for my kids. " <p> UPS wanted to help its hires succeed because of officials ' philosophy of the company 's role in the cities where they operate. " We want to be a part of the communities and organizations we serve, " Benedetto said. <p> As part of its involvement in TAP 's program, St. Joseph 's Hospital in north Fulton County took some unusual steps by mailing applications to potential welfare hires and faxing a list of available positions to DFACS, said Jim Goodman, the hospital 's employment coordinator for human resources. <p> Goodman reviews applications for ability and job history, particularly longevity, he said, making sure the applicant has held a job longer than a few months at a time. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most qualified people possible, " he said. <p> The hospital does not have a training or mentoring program to acclimate them to working, however, if the applicant has the required skill level, " I 'll give anybody a chance, " Goodman said. <p> " I started here as a transport, " said Goodman, who has worked at the hospital for 18 years. " I do n't have a degree, and I want the same thing for those employees that I want for myself. " <p> Of the 36 clients referred to St. Joseph 's by DFACS, one has been hired. CHART : HIRING WELFARE RECIPIENTS Almost 60 companies agreed to participate in The Atlanta Project 's effort to help welfare recipients find jobs. Below is a sampling of companies that are involved in the effort. They are willing to hire but sometimes can not extend offers because applicants lack basic skills or fail to show up for interviews.
