3042541 <p> Tehran, Iran -- An Iranian woman can be vice president, but she is forbidden from showing her hair in public. <p> She can be a lawyer but not a judge. In court, her testimony is worth only half that of a man. <p> In May, women showed they had the power to propel Mohammad Khatami into the presidency. But he might not have enough power to deliver the changes they seek. So Iranian women wait and hope. They face lives filled with contradictions, like the kind a 37-year-old secretary named Golrokh recently described, with tears in her eyes, outside a Tehran sandwich shop. In her child custody case, court documents recited the religious maxim, " Heaven belongs to the mothers. " <p> But she has barely seen her two children in the four years since her husband gave her permission for a divorce and took advantage of his rights to keep all their property and automatically get custody of the kids. <p> Golrokh told her judge : " I 'll give you heaven if you give me back my children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious regime. A 25-year-old secretary named Mitra met the hard edge of Islamic law on a trip to the airport last year. She was almost arrested for wearing light lipstick and makeup. <p> Members of the militia in charge of enforcing Islamic law took her and a member of her family to a minivan for a high-volume religious harangue that lasted more than an hour. <p> " They said, ' You are in a Muslim country, why do you wear such a thing? ' " she recalled. <p> But Mitra said she feels more secure lately. She sees the Islamic police less and believes Khatami is bringing more freedom to women. <p> Khatami won nearly 70 percent of the vote on a platform promising a " civil society, " implying more individual freedoms and a less religious rule. <p> He is president but not top leader. That post belongs to the hard-line Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is backed by the conservative establishment in Iran 's meld of government and clergy. <p> But 19 years after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 65 million people, Khatami 's efforts spark a debate about the nature of Iran 's Islamic society. <p> President Khatami appears committed to changing women 's status. In a speech to women in November, he said, " It is wrong to consider a woman a second-class citizen. " He added, " We must look at religion anew and purge practices that are considered religious but are not. " <p> Iran 's women hope he can bring clarity to their restricted lives. <p> In public, they adhere to the dress rules meant to keep men from seeing their hair and figures -- a head scarf and overcoat, or cape-like black chador. But still visible are the bottoms of their denim blue jeans and sneakers or high-heeled shoes. <p> Since the election, women have started showing signs of confidence in subtle ways. They show an extra bit of hair puffing out the front of their scarves, for instance. And after Iran 's national soccer team qualified for the World Cup championship tournament last month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. They gambled no one could argue with their boisterous immodesty -- some were even said to be dancing in the street -- as long as it was in support of this national triumph. <p> Soccer officials asked that women not attend the stadium rally for the team 's victorious return, but thousands of women showed up anyway and were eventually let in. <p> " I can not understand it, " said Mehranguiz Kar, a female attorney. " Women were n't interested in football. Now my daughter knows all the tactics. " <p> But Kar prefers to focus on more important matters. For starters, a woman 's life in Iran is literally worth less than a man 's. If a man kills a man in Iran, he probably will be executed in keeping with the logic that their lives were of equal value -- a life for a life. <p> If he kills a woman, he typically will not be executed. The execution can go forward only if the victim 's family pays huge sums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being that monetary compensation is necessary because the life of the male killer is worth much more than the life of the female victim. Women get half the damages men would get in lawsuits. They can work next to men but can not socialize with a man who is not their husband or relative. Though few men still practice polygamy, the law allows them four wives. Women can not get divorced without their husbands ' permission. <p> Men get automatic custody, if they want, of the children. In an intricacy of the law, boys can only stay with the mothers until they turn 2 years old, girls until they turn 7. <p> The laws are viewed as consistent with Islam, and its defenders include many women. One is Turan Jamshidian, editor of the family magazine, " Mahjubah, " or " Covered Lady. " <p> " Women are more secure in this country, " she said. " Allah understands what is better for us. " <p> To her, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them from sexual harassment. The laws valuing women 's court testimony at only half that of a man 's save women from the burden of determining the outcome of disputes. <p> " The concern should be more about what women bare in other parts of the world rather than what we cover here, " said Mallika Zamani, a senior editor at the conservative Kayhan newspaper. <p> That theme is often repeated, sometimes even by women who seek change. They do not want to become like the women in the West -- a land they know as plagued by teen pregnancy, divorce and crime. <p> That opinion may be reinforced by an Iranian media that vilifies Western ways. When the conservative press takes after Kar, they accuse her of trying to promote Western conduct, including prostitution. <p> Iranian women, as Jamshidian points out, can go to universities, take high posts in companies and edit magazines. <p> But even the most powerful Iranian woman says change must come. <p> Vice President Massoumeh Ebtekar is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she runs Iran 's environmental agency. <p> After she had returned from the recent global climate summit in Japan, Ebtekar sat in her office in a pinstriped version of the tent-like chador robe -- similar to a nun 's habit -- common for women here. She called her appointment another step in a pattern of progress for Iranian women, not a " superficial " change. But she continues to seek more change, speaking out for improvements in the divorce and custody laws and " women 's rights in the role of the family, to preserve her dignity. " <p> But, so far, the biggest legal victory for women was prompted not by this powerful Iranian woman, but rather a helpless 9-year-old girl. <p> Arian Golshani was beaten to death in September in the home of her father and stepmother, both of whom were convicted of child abuse. <p> Her parents had divorced five years earlier. After her death, and a funeral attended by thousands, the Iranian parliament voted to make it easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can prove the husband to be abusive. Human rights activist Shirin Ebadi said she hopes the law eventually will be changed to let judges consider the child 's best interest when awarding custody in a divorce. <p> " They all say, ' This is God 's law, ' " Ebadi said, referring to those who defend the Islamic rules on everything from divorce to dress. " I believe it is God 's law, but they are not interpreting it correctly. " are supposed to dress. Some are gradually ignoring the rules banning makeup and display of the hair. / LARRY KAPLOW / Cox Newspapers Changes in Iran are real, says Vice President Massoumeh Ebtekar. But some Iranians, including some women, oppose the changes. / LARRY KAPLOW / Cox Newspapers Human rights activist Shirin Ebadi stands near a photo of Arian Golshani, 9, who was slain in her divorced father 's home.
