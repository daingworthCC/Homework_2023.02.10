3071641 <p> After a summer of recall headlines, even Santa might be thinking twice about toys for this holiday season. <p> Indeed, some of the people on USA TODAY 's Shopper Panel say they are steering toward clothes and electronics for kids. Some are swearing off toys made in China, and others say they 'll stick with brands they know and trust. <p> But with many recalls from precisely the names parents did trust, what 's a shopper to do? <p> We talk to three experts -- all of whom deal with children 's issues or products and will be buying for children this holiday season -- about safety risks, toy shopping and their gift-giving plans this year. <p> The risk analyst <p> Not ' fearful ' of toys now with so many tests <p> Sports are going to be big this Christmas for Kim Thompson 's children and other young relatives. Everyone 's getting a ball. <p> The Harvard associate professor of risk analysis is n't reacting to recent recalls of toys. When she weighs risks, she worries more about obesity. Thus the activity-inspiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a niece and nephew 4 and 6, Thompson does n't need to think about choking hazards as much as some toy shoppers. She says most children stop mouthing toys and other objects by 3. But when her children were toddlers, Thompson found ways to reduce the chance they would mouth, choke on or swallow toys or toy parts. She favored board games and other toys the children would have to play with someone older who could keep a close eye on them. <p> " It 's really important to pay attention and interact " with children during play, says Thompson, also director of Harvard 's Kids Risk Project, which studies hazards to kids. <p> A key to shopping for safe toys is understanding how the child 's age and development affect how they play, she says. Some children, particularly those developmentally disabled, may put toys in their mouths until they are 6 or older. She says she stuck with plastic toys that were designed to be mouthed until her children were 2 and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges this year is choosing gifts for her 6-year-old nephew, who likes Legos. The problem is keeping them away from her niece, just turned 4. Thompson says she will avoid buying Legos for her nephew labeled only for children 6 and older. That 's even though she knows the girl does n't mouth things -- and that her brother wo n't likely let her near them anyway. <p> When Thompson shops for toys this year, she will : <p> *Avoid video games. They may be educational but not in the way parents hope, she says. <p> *Pick toys that promote physical activity and interaction. <p> *Steer toward toys such as Legos and K'Nex construction sets that encourage creativity. <p> Thompson says there is little reason to be " fearful " of toys, especially now that toymakers are doing so much testing. She 'll continue to buy brand names she knows at retailers she trusts. She wo n't avoid toys made in China. <p> Thompson worries that media scrutiny, like that with recent recalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. She notes that car crashes kill hundreds more children every year than toys. And the lack of physical activity among kids could lead to myriad health problems when they are older. <p> The pediatric surgeon <p> More worried about accidents, other injuries <p> After recalls this summer by Mattel and the maker of Thomas &; Friends trains, pediatric surgeon Cyndy Gingalewski went through all the trains, Barbie accessories and Dora the Explorer toys in her house to see if any were on the list. <p> Her 6-year-old daughter 's and 3-year-old twins ' toys were not affected, but Gingalewski still had the twins tested for lead. <p> Gingalewski, a surgeon at Children 's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C., and assistant professor at George Washington University 's medical school, does n't typically fret about toys. After all, she spends a lot of time operating on children who have been hit by cars or swallowed coins or pen caps. But the recalls gave her pause as the Christmas shopping season approaches. <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly from China, especially from Mattel, " Gingalewski says. " Everything we end up doing is a reaction to our last bad experience. There still is that worry : Are you putting your kids at risk based on the toy you 're buying them? " <p> She 's hardly avoiding Mattel altogether, though. Her 6-year-old gets a Barbie or Barbie outfit each month after completing her chores, and that will continue. " If there was an alternative type of product, I might consider buying it. But it 's not going to greatly change my buying habits. " <p> The twins, a boy and a girl, are getting past the age where they put everything in their mouths, but choking and suffocation risks are never far from her mind. Last year, she and her students performed about 80 surgeries to remove foreign bodies from kids ' esophagi. About 90% were coins. <p> Still, she keeps toy and other risks in perspective. " I 'm more worried about injuries based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids who are getting hit by a car, injured on a bicycle or injured as a passenger in a motor vehicle. Those are issues that are much more common and much more serious. " <p> This holiday season, Gingalewski says, she will continue to let her children guide her on what gifts they want. But she 'll steer toward arts and crafts to fill the time off from school rather than toys " that they 'll play with for an hour. " <p> Last Christmas, her children got a white cardboard playhouse they could color and decorate. Her 6-year-old got ice skates last year, and the twins will likely get them this year. <p> " I tend to do something that 's good for them to do and not just toy after toy after toy, " Gingalewski says. <p> She says she enjoys buying the toys she grew up with, such as Lincoln Logs and Tinker Toys, and watching her kids enjoy them as she once did. <p> " It 's a different toy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The toy store CEO <p> Basic wooden toys are tougher to break <p> Ed Schmults ' daughter, who will be 3 in December, is getting a wooden ice cream cart for Christmas. It 's made in Thailand and has wooden ice cream cones and popsicles. <p> As with most toys the toddler receives, her parents gave it a lot of thought and considered options. Schmults is leery of some particle board and plastic toys containing phthalates. That could limit the number of gifts under some kids ' Christmas trees, but when dad is CEO of toy retailer FAO Schwarz, it is n't a problem. <p> Schmults says everyone should put thought into toy shopping. " Parents need to really get involved in their children 's toys. Think about how children play and then think about the toys you are buying for that child. " <p> That includes considering " if your child is rough and tumble " and avoiding delicate toys. " Broken toys have sharp edges and small pieces, so they become something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says. <p> The Schmultses are partial to wooden and other more basic toys. Their daughter 's selection includes a wooden kitchen with wooden food, " quite a few dolls, " trucks, trains, musical instruments and arts-and-crafts kits. This year, he expects to add books and outdoor gear such as ice skates. " We want to keep her active, too. " <p> Until labeling improves, the average consumer might not have all the information Schmults does about toys. But he suggests asking questions about what the toys are made of and checking labels for their country of origin. He does n't, however, suggest ruling out any toy simply because it was made in China. " I do not believe all toys made in China are not safe, nor do I believe all toys made in the U.S. are safe. " <p> After learning that particle board -- often used in children 's furniture and some toys -- can legally contain lead, cadmium and arsenic, Schmults asked his buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He thinks particle board with chemicals may be fine for a bookshelf but less safe for products that a crawling baby might mouth. <p> Schmults says he makes sure toys and puzzles are not only appropriate for his daughter 's age because of choking risks but also that they do n't create " additional frustration " by being too difficult to master. <p> Schmults, whose toy stores are decidedly high-end, says well-made toys are n't necessarily pricey. He steers toward toys that have relatively simple designs that reduce the risk of breakage. If they 're " easy to manufacture, they last longer, " he says. " Avoid the tears on Christmas morning when a toy breaks, " Schmults says. " None of this requires expensive toys. "
