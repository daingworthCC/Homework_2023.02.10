3006541 <p> SOMEWHERE south of a wide spot in the road called Wagontire, Ore., a B-52 bomber at low altitude crosses Highway 395 headed east toward Mountain Home Air Force Base and the Saylor Creek bombing range in Idaho. If this is like most training flights, the pilots and crew are pretending that rural towns below are enemy targets as they sharpen their combat skills. <p> The Department of Defense maintains 25 million acres of mock war zones in the United States. Fighter jets wheel and soar at supersonic speeds. Pilots whiz over the ground at treetop level on " sandblower " routes hundreds of miles long, then drop bombs, fire rockets, and strafe giant bull's-eyes on the ground. Tanks thunder and clank like mechanical rhinos, blasting targets thousands of yards away. <p> Most of these war-gaming areas are in the West, but they are found in every other region as well. And now the Pentagon would like to expand its practice battlefields by 5 million acres, much currently under the control of other government agencies. <p> Among the proposals : 720,000 acres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tanks in Mississippi, 181,000 acres for naval air bombing in Nevada, and 1.4 million acres for Air Force bombing and dogfighting in Idaho. In all, there are 23 land proposals in 16 states - the most extensive military land expansion since World War II. <p> The military services contend that combat readiness needs to be improved despite( perhaps even because of) lessening superpower tensions and the improving prospects for nuclear arms control. Deciding to scrap short-range nuclear missiles in Europe( as President Bush did recently) gives greater importance to conventional arms like planes and tanks. <p> It is also argued that " peace dividend " cuts in active-duty troop levels increase the importance of National Guard units, whose " weekend warriors " need space not too far from home to keep their fighting skills honed. And finally, the Pentagon contends that the most modern weapons( like the M-1 Abrams tank and F-18 Hornet fighter) are a lot faster than their predecessors and therefore need more room to maneuver. <p> Even though most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American West, where human impact is minimal, it also can cause considerable damage. Last November, two Navy A-6 Intruder bombers accidently dropped about a dozen 500-pound bombs two miles outside the Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range near the Joshua Tree National Monument in California, wounding one camper and terrorizing several others. <p> Also last fall, the Navy( in an operation called " Project Ugly Baby ") dispatched several hundred sailors to check for spent ordnance on public lands around its aircraft bombing targets at Fallon, Nev. Among the findings : 1,389 live bombs, 2,230 duds, 28,136 rounds of ammunition, and 123,375 pounds of ordnance scrap metal. <p> The occasional plane crash or window-rattling sonic boom or stray bomb( usually inert and nonexplosive), are at least annoying to those who live, work, or play nearby. But it is the plans to expand military-exercise areas by 20 percent around the country which have critics particularly riled. They contend that vast grazing and recreational areas will be endangered, that wildlife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be adversely effected. <p> It is an issue that has created unlikely allies : cowboys, Indians, environmentalists, private pilots, and rugged-west politicians who in other contexts are supportive of the Pentagon. <p> Air Force plans to expand the Saylor Creek Range in southwestern Idaho fifteenfold - to 1.5 million acres - have caused the greatest stir. Lt. Col. James Cooper of nearby Mountain Home Air Force Base says that " there 's been a lot of compromise and a lot of flex " in the proposal, raising supersonic flight above 5,000 feet, for example, and reducing the number of live bombing targets. <p> But opponents are far from satisfied. <p> Saylor Creek " is not some pristine wilderness area, " says Idaho rancher Randall Brewer. <p> " Miles upon miles of fence, pipelines, roads, and power lines populate the area, " he told a congressional hearing in Washington. " Ranchers have spent thousands and thousands of dollars on range and water improvements on an intensively managed grazing system. Sportsmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who like to come and enjoy the solitude. " <p> Lindsay Manning, a tribal planner at the Duck Valley Indian Reservation( which is surrounded by the Air Force proposal), says, " Our opposition is based on treaty rights dating back to the 1860s, when the Shoshone-Paiute tribes were removed to allow white settlement and the safety of the Oregon Trail. " <p> " We were given a tribal homeland and sanctity and peace, and now we 're being crowded in again, " Mr. Manning says. <p> The Air Force 's draft environmental-impact statement concedes that the " overpressure " and " startle effect " from noise - 43 sonic booms a day - could have " potentially significant impact, " as could loss of wildlife habitat, fires from live ordnance and flares, disturbance to sacred Indian sites, restriction of access to water rights, and withdrawal of grazing and mining areas. <p> The Air Force lists things it would do to mitigate such effects. Others are not so sure ; some say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate to say it, but the Air Force has been lying to us, " says Brian Goller of the " Idaho is Too Great to Bomb Coalition. " <p> The period for public comment on the first Air Force environmental impact statement for Saylor Creek ends today, but the political battle is far from over. There will be a second round of reports and hearings in Idaho as well as back in Washington where lawmakers ultimately will decide how much military expansion will take place in Idaho and in other areas around the country. <p> For the moment, the military services seem on the defensive. Democratic Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, who has voted for " star wars " and chemical weapons, says " the military must be made accountable to the people of Nevada, whether the generals and admirals like it or not. "
