3049641 <p> Despite GOP fractures that are complicating House passage of a big tax cut, there is surprisingly wide support in both parties for some kind of tax relief. <p> With a vote expected today, the only real questions are which taxes will be cut and by how much. <p> " Everybody wants tax cuts, " said Rep. Ellen Tauscher, a moderate Walnut Creek Democrat. "( New York liberal) Charlie Rangel wants tax cuts. Ellen Tauscher wants tax cuts.( Texas conservative) Bill Archer wants tax cuts. We all want tax cuts. " <p> " The difference is, " Tauscher added, " that some of us want tax cuts that are irresponsible and will wreak havoc upon our economy... and some of us know that we still have a little spinach to eat before we go crazy at the dessert cart. " <p> Seeking to restore their party 's crown jewel, Republicans will try to pass through the House today the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan 's first term, a $792 billion, 10-year package that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gains taxes, eliminate the estate tax and reduce a host of other personal and business levies. <p> President Clinton has repeatedly promised to veto such an extensive package of cuts, arguing that the money should be spent instead on Medicare, defense and other programs. <p> As many as a dozen GOP moderates are also threatening to bolt, saying the cuts are too large.( South Bay Republican Tom Campbell declined to comment on the bill yesterday.) <p> Given the GOP 's slender five-vote margin, party leaders are pulling out all the stops to avoid an embarrassing defeat on the floor. But for all the posturing, the battle mostly boils down to how large a tax cut should be, not whether there should be one at all. <p> The combination of the projected $1 trillion budget surplus and Clinton 's eagerness to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare as his presidential legacy opens the door to a compromise. <p> Clinton initially said he would sign a $250 billion tax cut, and Republicans responded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medicare drug benefit. Yesterday, the White House insisted the line stops at $300 billion, and Republicans are betting that Clinton will ultimately sign something much larger. <p> " The president four months ago was for a zero tax cut, " said Newport Beach Republican Christopher Cox, a member of the House leadership. " Now he is in favor of a tax cut. That is progress. " <p> An unparalleled economic boom -- which generated not only huge projected surpluses but also a new investor class -- has clearly altered the political landscape. <p> The American people are responsible for the more than $4 trillion budget surplus projected for the next 15 years, so it makes sense to give them some needed and deserved tax relief, " California Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, said in May when she announced her own tax cuts. <p> For years, Democrats have fought tax cuts -- particularly cuts in income, capital gains and estate taxes -- charging Republicans with aiding the rich at the expense of the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a threat to Medicare and Social Security. <p> To be sure, Clinton and congressional Democrats will repeat that strategy -- but with a big difference. This time around, they are arguing more about the size of tax cuts than their legitimacy. <p> A substantial number of Democrats are lining up behind two iron-clad bastions of Republican orthodoxy : capital gains and inheritance tax reductions. <p> " The death tax has gone from being a proposal from the right-wing conspiracy to being a real possibility, " said Mark Bloomfield, president of the American Council for Capital Formation, which lobbies for lower taxes on capital. " It 's got legs. " <p> North Coast Democrat Mike Thompson cited the estate tax as " first and foremost " on his menu of possible cuts, saying the tax forces family vintners in Napa and Sonoma counties to choose between selling either their vineyards or their wineries when the owner dies. <p> " Family-owned business are the ones we need to take the first step in protecting, " Thompson said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also from the vantage of what it means to communities. " Thompson said paying the tax -- now 55 percent for the top bracket -- forces farmers to liquidate to developers, family newspapers to sell out to chains and small retailers to cede to big " box store " chains. <p> " I 'm for eventually eliminating death taxes, " Tauscher agreed. " I do n't think death is a taxable event. " <p> Tauscher said she would also like to " look to reduce capital gains taxes... for people that are making investments in American jobs and American companies -- which says, not for day-traders -- and clearly, I would look to make sure that we are doing something about the marriage penalty. " <p> Indeed, there is significant Democratic support for much of the GOP package -- from " marriage penalty " and alternative minimum tax relief, to extending the research-and-development tax credit( a big favorite of Silicon Valley), to tax deductions for individuals who buy their own health insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax incentives for retirement and education savings accounts. <p> The question is how much of this menu Democrats will support. " Now $250 billion is not a lot of money, " Tauscher cautioned, after ticking off a list of cuts she favors. <p> Sacramento Democrat Robert Matsui, a liberal veteran on the House tax-writing panel, conjectured the outlines of an ultimate compromise : " I think you 'd have to do a little marriage penalty, obviously estate tax relief, R &D; credits... and my guess is you 'll probably see some capital gains because Republicans will want that. " <p> A key battleground will be over income taxes. The 10 percent across-the-board cut in rates -- a Reagan lodestar and the chief element of the House Republican bill -- finds minimal Democratic support. <p> " I could go along with the president, but certainly that would be the outer limits, " Matsui said. " When you have( financing problems in) Medicare and Social Security, and all the surplus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it 's really risky strategy to come in with a tax cut of any substantial size. " <p> Matsui called the GOP bill " foolhardy, " adding, " I just do n't understand where they 're coming from on this one. " <p> GOP strategist Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, is urging Republicans to go for it all and continue passing the tax bill until Clinton relents. <p> " If Bill Clinton makes the same decision now that he made in ' 96 -- which is, I do n't want this 2000 election to be about taxes, ' just as Clinton did n't want the ' 96 election to be about welfare reform -- I believe he would sign a tax bill of almost any size in order to take that off the table, " Norquist said. " If Republicans do n't fold and we keep debating it into next year, and Clinton says no, Al Gore is toast. " <p> That strategy hinges, of course, on Republicans getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> CHART : <p>. HOUSE GOP TAX-CUT PROPOSAL. Republican leaders are confident that they will be able to push through their 10-year, $792 billion package, with a vote expected today. But there are some daunting obstacles : House Republican moderates are threatening to bolt unless the tax cuts are scaled back to about $500 billion( a figure that appeals to some Senate Democrats), some House conservatives are demanding even bigger tax breaks for families, and President Clinton has said he will veto anything that calls for more than $300 billion in cuts. Highlights of the main House GOP plan :. -- PERSONAL INCOME TAX Would reduce income tax rates by a total of 10 percent in four steps over 10 years. Current... in 2001... and by 2009 tax bracket... would become... would become 15.0% 14.7% 13.5% 28.0% 27.3% 25.2% 39.6% 38.7% 35.7% COST : $405 billion over 10 years.. -- MARRIED COUPLES Would reduce the so-called marriage penalty, " the quirk in the tax code that leaves many couples paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @.
