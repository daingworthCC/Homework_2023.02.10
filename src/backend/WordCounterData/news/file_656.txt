4187441 <p> SEATTLE -- Playing a position that faces the biggest spotlight in football, Marcus McMaryion did not want all the attention on him Saturday. <p> The Oregon State sophomore quarterback had heard the noise throughout the week about his return to the starting role in the wake of injuries to the two Beavers ahead of him on the depth chart. <p> But after a performance in a 41-17 loss at Washington that fell well below his own standards, McMaryion hoped the spotlight would shine elsewhere. He felt he did not deserve it. <p> " I did n't perform the way I should, " he said. <p> McMaryion finished the evening 12 of 26 for 148 yards and two interceptions against a challenge as steep as they come in the Pac-12. <p> After relieving Darell Garretson and Conor Blount last week against Utah, he was tasked with taking over an offense with a passing game that head coach Gary Andersen called " horrible " earlier in the week. It came on the road against the No. 5 team in the country that had a week off to prepare for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big second half performance from Tim Cook, who finished with 108 yards on 18 carries, they were depleted at running back without starting sophomore Ryan Nall( foot) or speedy freshman Artavis Pierce( shoulder). <p> Washington entered the crisp afternoon at Husky Stadium with the best passing defense in the Pac-12. Only one offense has thrown for more than 200 yards against the Huskies and it was Idaho in the midst of a 59-14 blowout on Sept. 10. Their defense has as many as 10 NFL prospects, while the OSU defense tried to stop the highest rated passer in the nation while held together by a number of freshman reserves due to injuries. <p> " Not really a weakness out there, " Andersen said of Washington. <p> And while the record disparities and injuries helped make the Beavers underdogs by more than five touchdowns, McMaryion refused to take positives away from his first night back in the saddle. Instead, he repeatedly iterated he needed to be better. <p> " I left a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " The guys around me did the job. The guys on defense were doing everything they can to slow down their offense. Me personally, I got to put that offensive performance on me. I did n't think I performed well at all. " <p> Those around the quarterback were far more forgiving. <p> " We just got to play cleaner football, " said senior wide receiver Victor Bolden, whom McMaryion targeted 10 times and had a team-high five catches for 58 yards. " We ca n't shoot ourselves in the foot with penalties and dropped balls. That goes on all of us. " <p> As the Washington offense turned the matchup into the widely predicted blowout in the first half, the OSU offense punted four times. On their second drive of the game, the unit turned it over on downs when Paul Lucas was stuffed on fourth-and-3 at the Washington 22. <p> The offense burned all of its first half timeouts with 5:20 to play in the first quarter. <p> And after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four drives, McMaryion overthrew his target downfield and Washington defensive back Darren Gardenhire came down with the pick. <p> Even as Oregon State failed to complete a touchdown pass for the fifth time in seven games, Andersen said McMaryion was " solid " and acknowledged there were chances when his teammates could have done more. <p> " I felt like we had four or five opportunities to really help Marcus and we did n't help him as much as we needed to as an offense, " Andersen said. " He battled his tail off in there and we 'll continue to work with that and continue to get better. " <p> Just as McMaryion declined to publicly glean any positives about his performance Saturday, he was similarly close to the vest in detailing which aspects needed to improve. He praised the game plan and repeatedly referred in the abstract to what was left on the field. <p> While drops and overthrows happen, an example of points left on the field came early in the fourth quarter. McMaryion took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Huskies ' 32-yard line. After consecutive incompletions on second and third down, Garrett Owens missed a 50-yard field goal that would have been from 45 yards without the penalty. <p> The game result had long been decided and no field goal would have altered the Huskies ' 10th win in a row dating back to when they beat up Oregon State 52-7 in Corvallis last season. <p> But for future games in which the Beavers are not as overmatched, the error could have been costly. <p> After a late interception to close the game, McMaryion headed to the sideline and got on the phone as Washington milked the final seconds off the clock. He spent more than a minute with a coach dissecting what had gone wrong, a head start on where he would need to be better over the next five weeks. <p> " He 'll continue to progress and continue to work, " Andersen said. " And so will the offense. "
