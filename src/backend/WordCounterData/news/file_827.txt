5021141 <p> CLEVELAND, Ohio - Starting Saturday, the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame is free to all Cleveland residents for at least the next 10 years. <p> It 's a move that Rock Hall CEO Greg Harris said should more than double the number of Clevelanders who visit the museum, which draws a large portion of its guests - at least 80 percent - from outside the region. <p> The initiative, dubbed the CLE VIP program, is being funded by a $10 million grant from the KeyBank Foundation, and was announced at a celebration Saturday morning at the Rock Hall. <p> In an interview before the announcement, Harris acknowledged that the museum, open since 1995, " has this perception of being a place for out-of-towners, for others. " <p> He added, " We want people here to understand that all are welcome. They are as important to us as those who travel great distances. " <p> According to museum estimates, fewer than 5 percent of the museum 's guests come from the city. In 2017, the museum attracted 568,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Harris said he believes cost is a barrier that has prevented many Clevelanders from coming to the museum, which already offers discounted admission to a broader group of Northeast Ohio residents. Northeast Ohio residents pay $19, while the general public pays $23. <p> Since 2002, the Rock Hall has offered free admission on Martin Luther King Jr. Day in January, when attendance spikes, particularly among Cleveland residents, according to Harris. <p> " We want them to be welcome every day, not one day, " said Harris. " We want it to be 365 days. " <p> In an emailed statement, KeyCorp CEO Beth Mooney said that access to arts and culture is an important part of the bank 's mission to create thriving communities. <p> " The Rock Hall is both a national and local treasure, " she said. " Through this grant we are not only providing free access to Clevelanders over the next decade but we are working to preserve the museum for future generations. " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest in the museum 's history, and also includes naming rights for the museum 's new Hall of Fame gallery, which will be " presented by KeyBank. " <p> In addition to free admission, the CLE VIP program includes other perks for Cleveland residents : a separate, shorter entry line, plus a complimentary beverage at the museum cafe. " We will treat them like they 're part of the family, " said Harris. <p> In recent years, the Rock Hall has unveiled a series of additions and improvements designed to boost the museum 's stature and attendance, both locally and around the world. Among the improvements : a new theater, a gallery focused on Hall of Fame inductees, and more robust programming, including a summer concert series. <p> Of course, those improvements are n't meaningful for people who ca n't afford to come to the museum. <p> Said Harris : " This is an opportunity to better serve our immediate community. This will allow our closest neighbors to better connect with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors. " <p> The agreement with Key calls for free admission for 10 years, though that may be extended, said Harris. <p> City of Cleveland residents will need to show proof of residency such as a driver 's license or state ID at the Rock Hall box office to receive free admission.
