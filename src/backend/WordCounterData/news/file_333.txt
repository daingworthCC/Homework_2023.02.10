3056741 <p> The Lamar girls basketball program has missed the playoffs the past few seasons. But Barbara Meadough, now in her ninth year as head coach, believes the Redskins can regain their place as one of the top teams in District 18-5A. <p> " The talent is there, " said Meadough, who led Lamar to an 11-14 record last season and a fourth-place league finish. " We 've barely missed the playoffs the last three years, so I know the kids will be extra motivated. I 'm optimistic. " <p> As was the cast last year, Lamar is off to a slow start, having won four of its first 11 games. But the Lady Redskins are showing improvements. <p> After getting embarrassed in a 53-5 loss to Baytown Sterling in the opener, Lamar bounced back to defeat Sharpstown 58-39. Lamar followed with losses to Elsik 46-36, Washington 52-33 and Klein 49-38 before defeating Madison 59-48. <p> " We did the same thing last year, " Meadough said. " We struggled early in the season, but got hot in district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As expected, Madison is the favorite in District 18-5A. But Meadough believes the second and third playoff spots are up for grabs, with the remaining five teams - Westside, Worthing, Bellaire, Westbury and Lamar - all in the hunt. <p> " Aside from Madison, it 's real balanced, " said Meadough, whose squad began league play against Westbury earlier this week after competing in the Houston ISD Tournament. " Lee does n't have a( varsity) team this year and Sharpstown dropped down to 4A. With only six teams, every game counts. It 's going to be competitive. " <p> Should Lamar make a push for the playoffs, it will be because of the play of Britney Davis-White. The 5-foot-8 senior has been a mainstay at guard for the Redskins the past few years. <p> Last season, Davis-White earned first-team, all-district honors after averaging around 15 points per game. Davis-White, who has started at point guard and two-guard, scored 20 points against Washington, 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Britney is so incredibly athletic. She also plays on( Amateur Athletic Union) tournament teams, so she works on her game year-round, " Meadough said. " She definitely has the talent to play Division I( college) ball. She truly deserves the opportunity. I hope she gets the chance. " <p> Margaret Glover, a 5-6 senior, has been playing two- and three-guard for Lamar. Glover is known for her quickness, joining Davis on Lamar 's track and field teams. <p> " Margaret does so many things well, " Meadough said. " She plays great defense, can score and helps us with our fast break. She also has run at the state track meet, so she knows what it 's like to compete at the highest level. " <p> Another veteran is Dustin Jones, a 5-9 senior. Jones, who started several games on the varsity a year ago, plays power forward. Jones is known as being a consistent rebounder. <p> " Dustin understands her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also provides a lot of leadership, which is going to be a key for us. " <p> Meagan Callegari, a 5-11 senior, is the center, although Meadough believes she could play elsewhere. Callegari was on the varsity last season, but saw limited action. <p> " Meagan 's got the skills to play either guard or forward, but with her size, we need her at the post, " Meadough said. " She shoots the ball well and has pretty good range. " <p> Rounding out the starting five is Jessica Jones, a 5-7 junior swingman for Lamar who was on the junior varsity a year ago. <p> " Jessica is a smart player who makes good decisions, " Meadough said. " She 's definitely going to help us. " <p> Maddie Morris, a 5-10 junior, is one of the first players off the bench. Morris, who plays power forward, provided a spark against Sharpstown, getting 12 points. <p> " Maddie is a strong girl who plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She just keeps learning and getting better with every game. " <p> Jennifer Lopez, a 5-3 freshman, is getting quality minutes at point guard. <p> " For a freshman, she 's shown us a lot so far, " Meadough said. " She 's improving and gaining confidence. She 's going to be our point guard the next few years. " <p> Cassandra Metu, a 5-9 junior, and Emma Wilking, a 6-0 junior, have drawn raves from Meadough. Wilking sat out last season after transferring from Jones. <p> " Cassandra 's definitely not afraid to mix it up, " Meadough said. " Emma 's another excellent athlete. She played volleyball for us this fall and is going to get some playing time. " <p> Ashley Thomas, a 5-2 junior, will play guard along with Erika Braun and Susan Seigano, a pair of 5-6 juniors. <p> Lamar boys team <p> Lamar boys basketball coach Dennis Gillespie believes the Redskins will not only hang with opponents during the 2002-03 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign wears on. <p> Despite graduating four starters from last year 's squad, which battled to a 19-13 mark and just missed the playoffs, Lamar appears to be a serious contender for the District 18-5A championship. <p> The biggest obstacle for Gillespie, who led Lamar to a 32-2 record and league title two years ago, is a youthful roster that includes two sophomores in the starting line-up. <p> " We 're going to be young, " said Gillespie, whose team owns a 4-4 start after last week 's Spring Woods Tournament. " But we 've got kids who know how to compete. " <p> It helps that Lamar 's top returnee and lone returning starter plays the most critical position - point guard. Jerry Cleveaux, a 5-foot-9 senior, is back after playing point and shooting guard a year ago. <p> Cleveaux, who had 16 points in a 49-37 victory over Fort Bend Austin and 22 points in a 69-60 loss to Hastings, is an all-district candidate who averaged 5.5 points and 6.5 assists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarterback of our team and really understands what we 're trying to do, " Gillespie said. " He does a great job of controlling the flow of the game. He does n't look to score all the time, but when the offense gets stagnant, he 's able to turn it on. " <p> Cleveaux 's backcourt mate is Anthony Washington, a 6-2 senior. Washington starts at shooting guard but can play some forward. <p> " Anthony 's going to be a solid player, " Gillespie said. " He 's quick, athletic and is going to win some games for us down the road. " <p> One of the biggest surprises has been the play of Jack Payne, a 6-3 sophomore, at off guard/small forward. Payne, who has made the transition from the freshmen team to the varsity, had an impressive debut against Westbury Christian, scoring 16 points. He also demonstrated tenacity on defense, getting four steals. <p> " Jack 's off to a great start, " Gillespie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play defense and come up with a few rebounds. He 's one of the top newcomers in our district. " <p> The Redskins ' frontcourt features two youngsters with limited or no varsity experience. <p> Kwasi Anane, a 6-3 junior, is the power forward. Anane played mostly on the junior varsity a year ago. <p> " Kwasi got a few minutes on the varsity last year, but he 's a fast learner, " Gillespie said. " He 's quick and plays the game with a lot of heart. " <p> Ben Heller, a 6-5 sophomore, is the starting center. Heller, as with Payne, came from the freshmen team but has shown improvement. <p> " Ben really executes well in the low post and is becoming more aggressive, " Gillespie said. " He 's capable of giving us 14-16 points a game and double figures in rebounds. He 's got a nice game for a sophomore. " <p> Lamar boasts a deep bench that could make a difference in close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will see plenty of action at power forward. Solomon played junior varsity last season. <p> " Neil 's a wide body in the post who is going to help us out, " Gillespie said. " He draws the tough fouls and is an accurate free throw shooter. He 's textbook solid. " <p> Dyracka Fance, a 5-7 junior, will back up Cleveaux at point guard, where he has already turned a few heads. <p> " Dyracka is new to the program, but he 's fitting in well, " Gillespie said. " He has a sweet, little jumper and is very heady. He 's what you look for in a point guard. " <p> DeLoren Orieh, a 6-1 sophomore, is expected to get quality minutes at the guard spots, while Corvin Jones, a 6-0 sophomore, is a swingman who has shown potential. <p> " DeLoren is very good on the defensive end, " Gillespie said. " Corvin 's a terrific shooter and can play some defense, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, also will see some action at center. <p> Gillespie also welcomes the addition of several players from Lamar 's district championship football team that advanced to the Class 5A area round. <p> Trey Hicks, a 6-4 senior, could be a factor at center/forward, while Andre Smith, a 6-0 junior, is another swingman who should figure into the rotation. <p> An ankle injury limited Hicks to just a few games last season. Meanwhile, Smith has plenty of experience with club teams. <p> " Trey 's a good ball player who can give us 8-10 points and will help us on the boards, " Gillespie said. " We 're looking for big things from Andre. He played some tournaments with his AAU( Amateur Athletic Union) team, so he knows how to perform in big games. " <p> Gillespie believes Lamar has the firepower to challenge teams like Westside, Worthing, Madison and Bellaire for the 18-5A title. But he admits the Redskins have a long way to go. <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " Once everyone understands their roles and gets a little confidence, we 're going to tough to play. I ca n't see us getting blown out of games very often. "
