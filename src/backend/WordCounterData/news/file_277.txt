3048841 <p> At first glance, Nachito Bermudez looks like any other baby -- sturdy and smiling as he sits in his father 's lap and kicks his chubby legs. But his dark brown eyes shaded by curly black bangs suddenly become vacant, staring off into space. He is oblivious to his father 's voice asking if he 's sleepy. <p> The 13-month-old boy bears no obvious scars from a vicious beating one year ago -- allegedly inflicted by a 6-year-old boy -- that stunned a neighborhood and the nation. But doctors say Nachito 's brain was permanently damaged and his motor skills, hearing and vision may be impaired for the rest of his life. <p> The accused attacker, who is now 7, also leads a different life from a year ago, when he was free to roam Richmond 's Iron Triangle neighborhood. He lives in a group home where his actions are closely monitored. Doctors and therapists spend countless hours trying to repair his damaged mind. <p> The boy, identified in court records only as Brandon, is funny and childlike -- a little showman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there 's no telling when he can return home. <p> On April 22, 1996, the lives of Nachito and Brandon crossed in what some saw as an omen of out-of-control juvenile violence. <p> Police say that Brandon, along with two 8-year-old friends, wanted to steal a tricycle from the Bermudez family and waited until the parents left the house. The children went inside, saw Nachito in a bassinet and dumped it over. <p> Brandon then allegedly kicked, punched and beat Nachito, then only 5 weeks old. One of the other boys touched the baby, possibly to see if he was still alive, and then the three fled. Nachito 's 18-year-old half-sister, Maria, was in the bathroom during the assault and told police she had n't heard anything. <p> Brandon was charged with attempted murder, then with assault. The charges were suspended and the boy was sent to social services. Because of his age -- and with his psychological problems -- he can not aid his attorney in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved from the Iron Triangle and are struggling to put their lives back together. <p> So far, there is no happy ending. <p>. <p> Nachito, whose full name is Ignacio Bermudez Jr., is different from other children his age who are eagerly exploring newfound skills. Nachito can not walk, can not crawl, can not even sit up by himself, and no one knows what 's going on behind his blank stare. <p> Sometimes he lies on the floor on a blue blanket decorated with smiling elephants. He rolls over once and smiles, then he rolls again and again, off the blanket, unable to stop himself. His mother picks him up and cradles him, but he does not respond to her touch. <p> " We can talk to him. He does n't listen to you ; he does n't see you. He 's got his own world. He does n't live with us, " says his father, Ignacio Bermudez Sr. " It 's really hard. I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes, it makes me cry. " <p> Sorrow etches the faces of Bermudez, 49, and his wife, Maria, 34. They did not celebrate Nachito 's first birthday last month because they " did not feel good " about his condition. They struggle to give Nachito the care he needs while raising their three other children -- Elias, 4, Javier, 3, and Carmen, 2. <p> " There are some days when it does n't seem like I have enough time to take care of all the things that I need to, " Ignacio Bermudez says, speaking in Spanish while an interpreter translates. " Everything is a hardship. " <p> Bermudez, a former farmworker who works at a fiberglass plant making ducts, switched to the 4 to 11 p.m. swing shift after Nachito was beaten so he could be with his family during the day to help with the children and take Nachito to physical therapy and doctor appointments. <p> The family, which moved to a modest home in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends meet. Clothes donated to the baby a year ago do n't fit anymore. Three of their children are in diapers. <p> All the children stay in their house or their tiny back yard, enclosed by a short fence. Bermudez does n't let the children play with other kids in the neighborhood. He has grown fearful, saying, " I 'm always afraid that what happened once could happen to my other ones. " <p> Then there 's " just the whole internal suffering all the time, " thinking and worrying about Nachito. <p> " It 's a problem I have even at night after I go to bed, " Bermudez says. " Every time he makes a sudden movement or something, I wake up and I 'm scared that something is happening. " <p> A few months ago, Nachito had a seizure in the middle of the night and was rushed to the emergency room. Because of the beating, his health is fragile -- he has frequent colds and was hospitalized earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olson of Children 's Hospital Oakland says Nachito 's brain damage is permanent. It 's possible the baby 's intellectual development may be better than his motor development, and he may be able to walk one day, Olson says. <p> The doctor praises Nachito 's parents, saying their " life of principle and love " has helped them deal with Nachito 's injuries better than many families would have been able to. <p> Maria Bermudez, a quiet woman who emigrated from Mexico after marrying her husband five years ago, says Nachito needs such constant attention that at first she did n't know how she could handle him along with the other children. <p> " The only thing I do is I ask God to give me the strength and the patience to look after my baby because he requires so much more help, " she says, cradling Nachito in her arms. " Sometimes, when I meet other women, they ask, ' How is it that you have that strength and that patience to take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength to survive. " <p>. <p> In an unidentified group home, specialists are trying to give Brandon the help he needs to live a normal life. He is under treatment for emotional and psychological problems and two learning disabilities. <p> Before the attack last April, Brandon was in special education classes. But the severity of his problems, which sometimes led him to act out in class, were not discovered until just before the assault on the baby. <p> His mother, who did not respond to requests for interviews, visits him in the group home regularly, according to Brandon 's attorney, John Burris. A few weeks ago, Brandon 's grandmother, who had a big role in raising him, died. <p> " I think he 's resilient, " Burris says. " The general consensus is that given where he was starting from, we see progress. " <p> Brandon was a happy, cute child who played and colored during his court hearings last year. He showed no signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described him as a troublemaker who sometimes stole things. <p> Contra Costa Deputy District Attorney Harold Jewett, however, says Brandon is still a dangerous boy. The prosecutor says that if Brandon is released from the group home any time soon, he will reopen the criminal case against him because he believes the boy needs years of extensive therapy. <p> " That kid has got some severe mental and emotional problems that need to be addressed, " Jewett says. " There was no disagreement about the extent of this kid 's psychological problems. It 's not the kind of thing that you can solve in one year. They will undoubtedly be problems that will take significant, intensive treatment. " <p> Jewett says there is no statute of limitations on a crime when a juvenile is declared incompetent to stand trial, as Brandon was. He says he is free to pursue the charges again, subject to a court 's approval. <p> Burris agrees that Brandon needs help. He says that 's why he argued that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of juvenile court. <p> " We were n't even dealing with a mature 6-year-old, " Burris says. " We were dealing with a kid who was like a 4-year-old, who could n't even count to 20. " <p> Burris is reluctant to discuss details of Brandon 's life, saying the child 's status in the social service system, which stresses confidentiality, prevents him from giving information about the boy 's treatment or prognosis. However, he acknowledges that the boy has had a rough life, exposed to crime, poverty and drugs. <p> Relatives said Brandon did not know his father, who was shot to death in North Richmond in 1994. His grandmother had a history of drug abuse, according to police. His mother had some minor scrapes with the law, but she defended herself last year as a hard- working mother who was trying to make a good life for herself and Brandon. The woman, who was working at a day-care center, has moved to another location in west Contra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had to deal with were hurtful to him and his development, " Burris says. " Brandon, in my own mind, is a victim. I do n't mean in any way to put him on the level of the Bermudez child. He 's a society victim. He 's a victim of his circumstances. " <p>. <p> The question that lingers is what to do with young children who commit violent acts. When can children comprehend right from wrong, curb their impulses for violence or understand the consequences of their actions? <p> Jewett defends his decision to prosecute Brandon, who may have been the youngest child ever to face attempted murder charges in the United States. The charges were reduced to assault when it became clear Brandon did not understand the permanence of death. <p> " There is no question in my mind that we did the right thing, " Jewett says. " There is no question in my mind... that Brandon knew that it was wrong to beat that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did anyway. " <p> Jewett, who heads the juvenile division of the Contra Costa County district attorney 's office, says it 's not unusual for him to handle cases of criminal acts by children, although he had never before or since prosecuted a defendant as young as 6. <p> Juvenile Hall Superintendent Jim Matheron says only teenagers used to be put in the hall. Now, he says, younger children are becoming a more common sight. But Brandon was the only 6-year-old ever locked up in Contra Costa County. <p> Burris says young children need to be helped, not prosecuted, when they do bad things. " It 's true that kids are committing crimes, but at what point in time do we see that we 're bordering on the point of ridiculousness? " <p> Burris says Brandon 's case is an aberration. But some child psychologists say they are seeing an alarming number of troubled, aggressive and sometimes violent children as young or younger than Brandon. <p> " It 's an unbelievable problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Children 's Hospital. " Those kids are a really high risk for major behavioral problems down the road. " <p> Schreier was appointed by the court last year to review Brandon 's state of mind and says he can not comment on the boy 's case because of confidentiality rules. <p> However, he says he sees many small children who have difficult temperaments and learning disabilities. Many times, parents do n't know how to handle the child, and sometimes make things worse by using corporal punishment or abusing the child. The child may increasingly act out to the point of committing crimes, he says. <p> Often, putting a child in juvenile hall can make things worse, Schreier says. <p> " We know that jails contribute to people 's criminality, " he says. He argues that troubled children would be helped more through early intervention and therapy. <p> Jewett says that it was only because Brandon was brought into juvenile court that the boy underwent psychological tests that persuaded a judge to put him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abused or neglected, social services would not have been able to take on his case, Jewett says. <p> Burris had argued initially that Brandon should be returned to his mother. <p> " I feel frankly gratified, " Jewett says. " We have this placement now that works quite nicely. " <p> Burris says he saw early on that the best hope for Brandon would be to get him into dependency court. He expresses surprise that Jewett would even suggest that Brandon should still face prosecution for the beating, saying the boy has always needed treatment and not punishment. <p> " That 's why you have defense lawyers. To protect 6-year-olds from people like Jewett, " Burris says. <p>. <p> One thing on which both attorneys agree is that the Bermudez family has shown remarkable grace and forgiveness throughout the ordeal. From the beginning, when Nachito was still in a coma at Children 's Hospital, Ignacio Bermudez said he did not want Brandon prosecuted. <p> In an extraordinary display of reconciliation, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year and told her they forgave her and Brandon. <p> " It was n't a hard thing for me to do because it was something that just came from within me, " Ignacio Bermudez says. " It 's just my feeling that a child of that age is not fully aware of what he 's doing. " <p> A few weeks ago, the family, including Nachito, ran into Brandon 's mother as they were leaving a restaurant in Richmond. <p> " She recognized me and she asked me how I was doing and she gave me a hug, " the father says. " She asked me how my baby was doing. I told her he was n't doing well. " <p> Brandon 's mother asked if she could see Nachito, and the father agreed. <p> " She came and looked at him. She did n't say anything. She just shook her head and walked away, " Bermudez says. <p> The woman asked if she could have his address, but Bermudez said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> He did n't ask her how her son was doing. But now, even as he looks at Nachito and sees him staring, lost in his own world, he does n't want the mother 's son to be tried for harming his baby. <p> " As long as he does n't do anything wrong, as far as I 'm concerned, he just needs help, " Bermudez says. " He 's just not well. " <p>. <p> Anyone wishing to contribute to the Bermudez family can send a check written to Baby Ignacio Bermudez, P.O. Box 1953, Richmond, CA 94802.
