4193541 <h> In China, an Education in Dating <p> As part of a course on how to find love, Zhang Zhenxiao, 27, was taught about grooming and how to flirt his way into a woman 's smartphone contacts. <p> NOV. 18, 2017 <p> Giulia Marchi for The New York Times <p> JINAN, China -- Zhang Zhenxiao is 27 years old. He has never been in a relationship. He has never kissed a woman. <p> Now, Mr. Zhang is ready for love -- but like many men in China, he does n't know where to begin. <p> So Mr. Zhang turned to a dating coach. The " Fall in Love Emotional Education " school, which caters to straight men, has taught him how to groom himself, approach a woman and flirt his way into her smartphone contacts. <p> " There are many people who lack the ability to have a relationship, " said Mr. Zhang, who enrolled in a three-day course during a weeklong holiday in October. " Many times, it 's not that there 's something wrong with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details to pay attention to. " <p> While dating is hard everywhere, it is arguably worse for Chinese men looking for a woman. China 's now-endedone-child policy, carried out in a country with a strong cultural preference for boys, prompted many couples to abort female fetuses. In 2016, there were about 33.6 million more men than women in China, according to the government. <p> Photo <p> Students attend theory classes at the " Fall in Love Emotional Education " dating school.Credit Giulia Marchi for The New York Times Photo <p> Zhang Mindong, who runs the " Fall in Love Emotional Education " dating school, said he was once like the men he teaches. A self-professed loser, or " diaosi, " he suffered a painful breakup in 2012.

Newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China could lead to an increase in human trafficking, sex crimes and social instability. So the government is playing matchmaker. <p> In June, the Communist Youth League, a training ground for many top officials, organized a mass speed dating event for 2,000 young singles in the eastern province of Zhejiang. The same month, the All-China Women 's Federation in northwestern Gansu Province helped organize a similar event for " leftover men and women, " a term used in China to refer to unmarried people in their late 20s or older. <p> For decades, Chinese marriages were arranged through matchmakers or families. In some places, parents still post the r? sum? s of their single children on trees and lampposts. <p> Marriage was utilitarian, done so people could start a family. Even when the notion of " freedom to love " became popular after 1950, there were few social venues for people to snuggle and mingle. Until the late 1990s, sex outside marriage was illegal. <p> Mr. Zhang 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the men he teaches. A self-professed loser, or " diaosi, " Zhang Mindong said he suffered a painful breakup in 2012. He turned to the internet to find solutions and discovered the term " pick-up artist. " <p> Zhang Mindong started his school in the eastern city of Jinan in 2014, which he now runs with Cui Yihao, 25, and Fan Long, 29. Their services range from $45 for an online course to about $3,000 for one-on-one coaching. Similar schools have opened in several Chinese cities in recent years. <p> The number of students who take offline courses at " Fall in Love Emotional Education " has grown from one in 2014, to more than 300 now, according to Zhang Mindong. About 90 percent of graduates end up with girlfriends, he said. <p> At the October session, there was Yu Ruitong, a 23-year-old software developer who had three previous relationships ; Ye Chaoqun, a 27-year-old small business owner who is hoping to make the woman he likes fall in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer doctor who is looking to expand the circle of women he knows. Both Mr. Ye and James Zhang have returned to polish what they learned earlier -- this time free of charge. <p> To show his students what they were up against, Zhang Mindong held up a profile of an attractive woman on a dating app that had garnered " likes " from 7,000 men. " This is the environment in China, " he said. <p> In the first hour, Zhang Mindong proclaimed them sartorial disasters. Most of the first day was devoted to improving dress.( " Narrow collars, sleeves should be folded up above the elbow and trousers should be fitted. ") They bought clothes and got haircuts. <p> " After getting into a relationship with a woman, many Chinese men let themselves go. They do n't wash their hair, change their clothes and become really dirty, " said Zhang Mindong, who was wearing hip glasses and a fitted white shirt. <p> Photo <p> A photo session, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfies to use for online profiles.Credit Giulia Marchi for The New York Times Photo <p> Zhang Mindong, left, a dating coach, explains to his student, Zhang Zhenxiao, how to pose for a profile picture.Credit Giulia Marchi for The New York Times <p> " But that 's not the case for women, and this is why so many Chinese men ca n't have a long-term relationship. " <p> The makeovers are followed by the students posing for photos -- reading Stephen Hawking 's " A Brief History of Time, " sipping tea and nibbling canap? s presented in a silver bird cage, looking pensively out a window. That culminated in selfies with Wang Zhen, a female friend of Mr. Cui 's. <p> That 's designed for dating in the digital era. In China, where the mobile internet has revolutionized social life, getting to know a person takes place almost exclusively on WeChat, a popular social media tool that is used by nearly 1 billion people. <h> An error has occurred. Please try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email. <p> Most social interactions in China usually start or end with people scanning each other 's WeChat QR codes -- a practice known as saoing -- or adding each other 's WeChat IDs. Many women form their impressions of men based on photographs on WeChat 's " Moments, " a Facebook-like tool. <p> On a Thursday night outside a busy shopping mall in Jinan, the students got their first challenge : approach women and ask for their WeChat contacts. <p> " You give her two choices : ' Why do n't you add me or I sao you? ' " Zhang Mindong told the students. " So no matter what she picks, you 'll succeed. " <p> After practicing their moves on Ms. Wang, the students set off. Zhang Zhenxiao rushed up to two women, who paused but continued walking. He chased after them and stopped them again. After a minute, they walked away. <p> " No, the fact that you approached them means you did, " Mr. Cui said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the night, all the students had obtained at least one WeChat contact. <p> The classes, held in an apartment on the grounds of Shandong University, have an air of brotherly camaraderie -- the students, huddled together on a floral couch scribbling in notebooks, practiced real smiles and flirtatious banter with their coaches. <p> A materials buyer for a renovations company, Zhang Zhenxiao said he had never learned how to talk to a woman. His high school forbade students from mixing with members of the opposite sex. His parents had an arranged marriage. <p> Now, they are giving him pressure to settle down. He is on a quest for his ideal woman -- a bubbly tomboy who likes wearing jeans and not skirts all the time. <p> " I think there are many single women who are just like me, " he said, " all longing for love.
