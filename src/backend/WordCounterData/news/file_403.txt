3068141 <p> Only a couple of hundred yards into his first practice run, wheelchair racer Jody Kemp swerves a little too sharply on the gravel and topples over, landing ignominiously on his right shoulder, his useless legs still strapped into the footrest. <p> Team manager Mike Whiting, who has driven a short distance down the mountain road and is waiting in his pickup, witnesses the mishap and hops out immediately. He trots the few steps back up the hill and rights the fallen rider as matter-of-factly as if he were retrieving a lost sack of grain. <p> Within seconds, the wiry young man is on his way again, hurtling down the incline west of Evergreen in his screaming yellow titanium carriage at better than 30 mph - so fast he must ride the hand brakes to avoid running into the moving truck in front of him. <p> A half-mile farther down, Kemp takes a short cut at a curve, bounces across a grassy hillock and comes to an abrupt stop at the edge of a 3-foot dropoff that leads back to the main road. <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but steep descent poses a serious challenge to the 25-year-old paraplegic from Fort Collins. <p> Carefully, he eases his high-tech chariot down the slope, lurching as it hits the bottom of the ditch next to the road. Then, using his arms to propel the rear wheels, he muscles his way back up onto the gravel and goes careening downhill again, quickly catching up to the pickup on the strength of gravity alone. <p> " That was fun! " Kemp beams at the end of the run, as he removes his motocross-style helmet and dusts off his padded jersey. " Man, she handles great. It 's going to be a great summer. " <p> Welcome to the harum-scarum world of all-terrain wheelchair racing, the latest entry on a growing list of sit-down sports that already includes monoskiing, water skiing, rafting, cycling, tennis, bowling, basketball and rugby. <p> In essence, it 's a hybrid form of mountain biking in which disabled athletes compete directly against able-bodied riders - as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a premium on speed and handling rather than pedaling power. <p> Thus far, probably fewer than 500 wheelchair users have entered such races, which conclude in California in late August every year with a harrowing downhill aptly named the Kamikaze. <p> But riders with four-wheeled carts have achieved such success that some members of the National Off-Road Bicycle Association, the two-wheelers ' governing body, are arguing that they should compete exclusively against each other, just as wheelchair-bound road racers do in footraces. <p> In April, for example, all-terrain chairs( ATCs) took first, fourth and ninth places in the annual Bikes and Bumps mountain bike race on the snow at Arapahoe Basin ski area. <p> Last summer, Dave Noonan of Fort Collins, one of the first disabled Coloradans to take up the fledgling sport, set a course record in winning a NORBA downhill at Vail, outdistancing his closest able-bodied rival by 3 1/2 minutes. <p> A few weeks later, another disabled rider, Gretchen Schaper of Boulder, took a medal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ski slopes at Mammoth, Calif. <p> Previously, Matt Feeney of Winter Park, yet another paraplegic racer, had won a downhill at Big Bear, Calif., reaching speeds in excess of 50 mph on rough, rutted fire roads. <p> Mike Whiting, a Denver inventor whose innovative Wildernet machines are fast becoming the top racers ' chairs of choice, predicts that ATCs will eventually catch on with the disabled community in the same way that mountain bikes have caught on with the able-bodied. <p> The low-slung conveyances - which look like go-karts with bicycle wheels - are designed for use by paraplegics, amputees and other mobility-impaired individuals. But Whiting says they also should appeal to senior citizens who might enjoy coasting down mountain trails without having to do it astride two-wheelers. <p> Up to now, however, the ATCs have been acquired mainly by young, active, resilient types - adrenaline addicts who may have lost the use of their legs but clearly not their thirst for competition. <p> " It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in wheelchairs now, " observes Steve Ackerman, a wheelchair athlete from Fort Collins who rode across Europe and Asia last year on a hand-powered cycle called the Freedom Rider. <p> Several racers, including some members of a loose-knit factory team assembled by Whiting, became paralyzed while engaging in speed contests or other high-risk sports, Ackerman points out. <p> Sarah Will, now a world-class monoskier from Vail, broke her back in a ski race. Greg Adcock, another team member from Fort Collins, suffered a similar injury in a motocross event. Feeney, who coordinates the sit-ski program at Winter Park, lost the use of his legs in a diving accident at Lake Powell. <p> " Once you do this stuff, you keep on doing it if you can, " says Ackerman, who was injured in a car wreck in Poudre Canyon on the way to go skiing at Steamboat in 1987. <p> " What I tell groups I speak to, or people who are newly disabled, " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked at my legs that I could n't use anymore and thought, I could n't ski, I could n't go cycling, I could n't run. Well, guess what? Now I do them all - just in a different way. " <p> On their first road trip of the summer, five members of Whiting 's factory team are due to enter a downhill race in a Colorado mountain-biking competition called Rage in the Sage. <p> But on a trial run the day before, they discover that the 3 1/2-mile route outside of Gunnison has so many uphill sections it seems more like a cross-country course than a downhill. What they have estimated will take 20 minutes to finish actually takes close to two hours. <p> Instead of plummeting steeply downward, the racers find themselves having to push their chairs inch by inch up several vein-popping grades, moving their wheels forward with their hands just as they would in conventional wheelchairs. In some cases, exhausted, they turn to Whiting for a little extra pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the course. <p> But the experience seems typical of the many frustrations the racers face both as competitors and as disabled individuals : <p> In a hotel room where she plans to stay the night, Sarah Will, a poised 31-year-old who travels all over the country as an accessibility consultant, discovers that her standard wheelchair can not get into the bathroom. <p> " Well, gon na have to do the salamander, " she says to a teammate. Then, in a maneuver that many able-bodied people might find humiliating, she flops onto the floor and drags herself through the opening with her arms. <p> Another racer, Darol Kubacz, an ex-forest ranger who lives in Avon, decides to forgo camping one night to stay with someone he knows in a motel. But the room is on the second floor, and there 's no elevator. So how to get up? <p> He prevails on a photographer who 's accompanying the group to haul him up the stairs piggyback-style, while Kubacz in turn carries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll bet that 's the first time you 've carried a grown man on your back, " he tells his chauffeur. <p> At the end of their initial run on the misnamed " downhill " course, the racers - bushed - relax for a while on the grass at an athletic field at Western State College. When it comes time to leave, however, they find that their chairs wo n't fit through the slot in a chain-link fence separating the finish-line area from the parking lot. <p> The only other way out, a gated entrance for vehicles, is locked. Rather than go through the hassle of trying to find someone with a key, though, the wheelchair racers settle on a more expedient solution - pulling the pins off the hinges and opening the other end of the gate. <p> Later, rather than heading for home prematurely, the racers decide to make the best of a disappointing situation by spending the afternoon of the downhill taking runs down a shorter but more suitable road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process. <p> As one observer remarks, " These guys do n't give up easily. " <p> To get to and from Gunnison, the racers drive their own cars, which invariably tend to be full-sized 4-wheel-drive vehicles. " You do n't ever want to be in a situation where you 're stuck, " one explains. <p> On longer, overnight trips to races in Utah or California, they travel the hundreds of miles together in two diesel-powered crew-cab pickups that Whiting rents from Phil Long Ford for $ 450 a week. The trucks have to be roomy enough to carry all their gear and their personal chairs plus the ATCs, which sit crossways side by side, two in each bed. <p> The first all-terrain chair that Whiting created was called the Phoenix, after the mythical bird that rose from its own ashes. It was made of steel and weighed more than 60 pounds. The latest incarnation, the Phoenix 2, is made of aluminum and titanium and weighs less than 40 pounds. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brakes, speed-sensitive steering and a shock-absorbing system that offers 5 inches of play in the rear end to cushion riders whose legs no longer flex, it bears little resemblance to the traditional hospital-style wheelchair. <p> With four times the braking power of a regular bike and an independent suspension design borrowed from the Viking Mars lander, it 's controllable even at speeds approaching 60 miles per hour. The price, race-ready : about $ 4,000. <p> That 's double the cost of a hand-cycle and four times the cost of a high-performance mountain bike. But as Ackerman notes, " All equipment for people with disabilities is specialized, and as such is more expensive. It 's not something you 're going to see on the shelves at Wal-Mart. " <p> Whiting, an engaging 36-year-old who assembles the Phoenix chairs in the basement of his south Denver home, says they are faster than many regular bikes in downhill races because their four wheels and low center of gravity make them more stable in turns. But on cross-country courses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive train - a hand crank, chain and gears - makes them uncompetitive. <p> To level out the playing field, Whiting has been pushing NORBA to set up a separate classification for ATC racers. This, he says, would not only recognize their athleticism, but also make it easier attract commercial sponsorship. Moreover, such a move would make ATCs more visible( and thus more marketable) to the disabled community at large - a population that ranges from people with multiple sclerosis or cerebral palsy to paralyzed veterans who could use off-road chairs for fishing, hunting and other outdoor pursuits. <p> But not all ATC users back the idea. One is Californian John Davis, a trailblazer who secured a spot on the Specialized factory team by racing against able-bodied cyclists in a bone-jarring Cobra chair that Whiting calls " the shopping cart " because it has no suspension. <p> " John Davis wants to run with the pros, " comments Mike Feeney, who has raced in a 54-pound chair made by Enduro, yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to start thinking about the future of the sport. " <p> Feeney, 33, would like to see ATC racers compete against each other, as about two dozen of them did in a wheelchair-only national championship series he won in Kentucky in 1993. Still, he sees some potential drawbacks to such an arrangement. <p> Last summer, for instance, at the NORBA race at Big Bear, Calif., the six or seven wheelchair racers who entered were placed in a separate class. But as Feeney recalls, they had to run last on the schedule - behind as many as 1,000 other riders. First to go, at 9 in the morning, were the pros. Then came the experts, then the sport class, then juniors, followed by seniors and, finally, the ATCs. <p> " We ran at 5 in the afternoon, and there was nobody there, " he remembers. " By 4 o'clock, even ESPN was gone. " <p> So much for media exposure. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point. <p> " Wheelchairs have been involved in NORBA events since the late ' 80s. They 've been included with open arms, and the competition has been great, " says Philip Milburn, chief operating officer for Colorado Springs-based USA Cycling, parent organization of both NORBA and the U.S. Cycling Federation, which represents road-bike racers. <p> As obstacles have cropped up, such as starting gates too narrow or trees too close together to accommodate the 36-inch-wide chairs, NORBA has worked with race sponsors to resolve the problems, Milburn says. But any move to set up a separate category or sanctioning body - with separate rules, scoring, equipment standards or definitions of disability - will have to come from the ATC racers themselves, he insists. <p> " This is generally a two-wheeled sport, and we do n't want to turn it into a four-wheeled sport, " Milburn asserts. " If there 's going to be a four-wheeled cart association, fine. But we 're not interested. " <p> More than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rely on wheelchairs. But while the sleek ATCs ridden by members of Team Phoenix draw crowds of appreciative gearheads at mountain bike races, they appear almost unknown among the disabled population at large. <p> Roger West, head of Wilderness on Wheels, a nonprofit group dedicated to making the outdoors more accessible to wheelchair users, confessed earlier this month that he had never heard of Whiting 's machines. <p> Mike Feeney, at the National Sports Center for the Disabled, reported that even though he has " been hyping this sport for two or three years, " only a few of the wheelchair users he has seen at Winter Park have expressed much interest in it. <p> Sarah Will hopes to change all this in her role as an accessibility adviser for Vail. Using her own racer plus two prototypes already acquired by the ski resort, she is offering guided ATC tours on its trail system starting this summer. <p> " It 's just so much fun, you 're just smiling all the way down the mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won five gold medals in the Paralympic Games( two in 1992 at Albertville, France, and three in ' 94 at Lillehammer, Norway). <p> " There 's no learning curve, " she enthuses. " You do n't have to worry about finding the balance point, like you do with ordinary wheelchairs. You go down three times and you say, ' Oh, I get it. ' And there are so many things you can do with these chairs - like go down stairs - that you do n't have the fear that you 'll run into an obstacle and not be able to get around it. " <p> Certain precautions may have to be taken in case of mechanical failures, Will concedes. For instance, every ATC user may have to be either accompanied by an able-bodied rider or equipped with a radio or cellular phone. " We ca n't take the risk of stranding anybody out there, " she explains. " It 's not like they can walk down the mountain. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will hopes to organize summer camps in which disabled riders might spend one day touring around the mountain, say, and a second day training or racing. <p> " There 's no reason why the physically challenged population ca n't explore everything Vail has to offer, " she declares. " It 's a town built for recreation, and it should be accessible to everybody. " <p> Ironically, while Whiting 's newfangled wheelchair can also enable the disabled to get into designated wilderness areas( where conventional bicycles are prohibited), its lack of a means of propulsion may turn away some potential users. <p> " At $ 4,000, it should have a drive train, " argues Matt Feeney, who has used a Freedom Rider with 21 gears to explore some of the back roads and trails around Winter Park. <p> " I think at some point this is going to be a sport for endurance athletes, but either the Freedom Rider is going to have to be more of a mountain bike or the Wildernet is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Whiting, who likes to describe his basement as Wildernet 's " world headquarters, " agrees that a hand-cycle would be a logical next step. But integrating a chain and gears into the full-suspension design of an all-terrain chair, he stresses, is a real challenge. <p> " I 've been working on it for a year and a half, but I 'm not satisfied, " he says. " It 's at least a year off. " <p> Meanwhile, those 's no shortage of racers who love simply blasting down mountain trails in what Sarah Will jokingly refers to as a " dirt luge. " <p> One of the biggest fans may be Jody Kemp, who entered numerous road races using a more conventional three-wheeler before buying one of Whiting 's custom-made models earlier this year. <p> " This has really opened up a lot of doors, " says Kemp, a Colorado State University psychology student who lost the use of his legs when he was hit by a car in New Jersey at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a lot more freedom in the outdoor environment, to enjoy more activities with my friends. It 's a part of life that many able-bodied people take for granted, but that you have to give up if you 've always got to stick to paved roads or sidewalks.
