" -- " Kiss Me, Kate. " <p> * -- <p> FOR playgoers, patiently sitting out summer movie releases and up to their mosquito-bitten ears in outdoor Shakespeare festivals, there is no more exciting or promising phrase in the language than " the fall season. " Especially on Broadway, where entire careers, reputations and fortunes are at stake. <p> Everybody else 's year-end dusk is, for playgoers, a kind of dawn, an October spring training. As the days grow short, marquee lights go on earlier as spectators ' hopes rise like a dusty old gold velvet curtain. Summer in the theater is like a three-month matinee, but after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehearsal in drab, air-conditioned lofts, dancers pounding out complex patterns, singers with scarves around their throats taking swigs of exotic elixirs to protect their voices. <p> Casts sit in semicircles around the director, producer and playwright, reading new scripts in T-shirts with the name of the show emblazoned on the front, clutching iced coffee in Styrofoam cups and munching tepid pizza. Nothing is set now, frozen or blocked. Nobody is screaming at anyone yet. No creative differences have been declared. Director, producer, star and playwright are atwitter, all " thrilled " to be working with each other. Reality and rewrites and tantrums and billing and jealousies and cast romances and agents have not yet set in. <p> Each new season always promises more than it can deliver. It 's the best time of year in theater, when every unopened show is a smash, ads in the Sunday papers twinkle with stars and, scanning the names, your heart beats a little faster. Expectations soar unreasonably as shows trumpet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out-of-town critics and, pasted diagonally across the top of ads, the bold phrase, " OPENING NIGHT SOLD OUT! " Well, comped out anyway. <p> In mid-September, there are no second nights, no last nights, no two-week closing notices, no petitions to fire Frank Rich. For now, there 's no backbiting, just back-scratching as press agents busily arrange interviews and advance pieces on upcoming shows. Meanwhile, 87-year-old Al Hirschfeld, whose snow-white beard makes him look like a hip St. Nick, has been on the road sketching incisive caricatures for the Sunday Times, a 50-year tradition, first roughing them out in darkened theaters during previews. <p> The wining and dining begins in earnest among producers trying to woo the most silently powerful contingent in town, theater-party leaders who, with the gimlet-eyed skepticism of a Shubert, watch video run-throughs of backers ' auditions and decide whether to recommend the show to their groups whose advance ticket sales can buy time for a show. <p> For now, everyone is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few more weeks, turns Broadway into the happy face it presents each year on the Tony Awards show, a place where seldom is heard a discouraging word, although the " Miss Saigon " controversy got the season off to a rousing start -- a lively curtain raiser that, if nothing else, is sure to provide " Forbidden Broadway 1990 " with a nasty little parody. <p> Until now, negative notices and dwindling box-office receipts have n't existed. The critics were silent but stirring in their lairs, sharpening pencils, claws, cliches and bon mots while gluing their rare valentines, awaiting the first opening of the 1990 season last week : " The Miser, " with Philip Bosco and Carole Shelley. <p> Although the Broadway " season " is, like the TV season, less defined now, with a second season opening January 22 and a third mini season arriving in late spring to capture the tourists, October remains the official, the emotional, opening. October is the best time to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> It 's the month when the city is at its most light-headed and Manhattan feels like Woody Allen 's movies look ; when the writers, artists and actors return from their sandy retreats, romance blooms again in dimly lit hotel bars and the city returns to its brisk, tangy, tweedy, mittened, mufflered, chestnut-roasting self. Summer in New York is for novices and tourists ; autumn in New York is for Broadway-seasoned pros. <p> Last season was a boom year on the Rialto( Where is the Rialto, anyway? Near Tin Pan Alley?), so this fall things seem quieter, with only a few dramas opening. Besides " The Miser, " there is only " Stand-Up Tragedy, " which goes directly to New York from the Marines Memorial Theater, opening in previews September 25 ; John Guare 's new play, " Six Degrees of Separation, " the hot off-Broadway ticket, which moves to Broadway October 30 with Stockard Channing replacing Swoozie Kurtz ; and " Shadowlands, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Catholic writer S.C. Lewis and a Jewish poet, with Nigel Hawthorne and Jane Alexander. <p> Off-Broadway 's most interesting fall openings are " Money Talks, " a comedy by Edwin Schloss with musical-comedy stalwarts Helen Gallagher and Dolores Grey ; Beth Henley 's " Abundance "( October 16), with Leslie Ann Warren and Amanda Plummer as mail-order brides who head west) ; and a Joyce Carol Oates ' play about women 's bleak lives, " I Stand Before You Naked "( in November). <p> It looks like an iffy fall for musicals except for that one-man revival, Michael Feinstein. In " Piano and Voice, " the former and maybe future cabaret singer returns for his third Broadway concert( October 2-27) in a more scaled-down performance than his earlier flashier shows. Just Feinstein at the keyboard in the first act, returning in Act II with a cozy combo. <p> Something called " Once on This Island, " a Caribbean folk tale about a peasant girl who rescues a rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephen Flaherty, opens in previews October 18. <p> Following its San Francisco run, " Buddy, " the English musical by Alan Janes about Buddy Holly, the seminal ' 50s rock-and-roll star who died in an airplane crash, opens in New York October 23. The show, half biography, half concert( Act II re-creates Holly 's final show with Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper), stars Paul Hipp, who originated the role in London. <p> The most-awaited revival this season is David Merrick 's return to Broadway after years of legal, marital and medical troubles( he 's still partly disabled from a stroke a few years ago) with his 88th show -- an all-black revival of the 1926 Gershwin musical with Gertrude Lawrence, " Oh, Kay! " The show, which originated at the Goodspeed Opera House last year, is now enlarged and the archaic Guy Bolton-P.G. Wodehouse book updated by director Dan Siretta, Goodspeed 's gifted choreographer. With its locale now moved to Harlem from Long Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gershwins ' best, most light-footed, scores : " Dear Little Girl, " " Maybe, " " Clap Yo ' Hands, " " Do Do Do, " " Someone to Watch Over Me " and " Fidgety Feet. " It opens September 29. <p> Also old news to Bay Area playgoers, along with " Stand-Up Tragedy " and " Buddy "( not to mention " Peter Pan " with Cathy Rigby, which finally gets to Broadway December 13 after a five-year out-of-town tryout), is the return to New York after nine years of " Fiddler on the Roof " starring Topol. The same sturdy revival that ran here in 1988 and has been touring ever since, circles New York for a landing November 18. Topol did the role in London, toured the planet with it and made the film but never played Tevye on Broadway. <p> " Shogun, " the first new American musical of the season, and until " Miss Saigon " the most elephantine( a multimillion-dollar show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clavell -- its official title is " James Clavel 's Shogun, the Musical "), lumbers into New York on November 1, at the appropriately monstrous Marquis Marriott Theater. With book and lyrics by Donald Driver and music by Paul Chihara, it stars June Angela and Peter Karrie, plus, one may safely assume, a full complement of full-blooded Asian actors. <p> Long-delayed, after a scheduled 1989 opening now due January 28, is " Nick and Nora, " the musical based on " The Thin Man " films, starring Barry Bostwick and Joanna Gleason as William Powell and Myrna Loy, with music by Charles Strouse, lyrics by Richard Maltby Jr. and book by Arthur Laurents. <p> The one-man shows range from " Jackie Mason : Brand New "( October 18) to Hal Holbrook 's " King Lear "( in October), with Calvin 's Trillin 's " Words, No Music "( October 11), a show about the King 's English, somewhere in between. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-act show opens in previews December 18 at Playwrights Horizons, off -Broadway. " Assassins, " a musical about presidential assassins, with a book by John Weidman and directed by Jerry Zaks( cast still unannounced), is probably the fall season 's surest thing, if anything is. We all heard John Wilkes Booth was a bad actor, but who knew he could sing?
