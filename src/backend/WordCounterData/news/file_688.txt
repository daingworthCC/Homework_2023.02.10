4190641 <h> Portland Metro Wednesday Weather : Enjoy this last day of regular temps - heat is coming <p> It 's hard to keep our attention on Wednesday 's weather as forecasters warn of a big heat-up coming our way. But we 'll do our best. It is only Wednesday, and today 's weather should be much the same as we 've seen for the past two days. <p> We 'll start the day fairly clear at dawn then some light marine clouds will drop in and keep us partly cloudy though lunchtime. Those clouds come with some relatively cool air and help keep our high for Wednesday to 84 degrees. <p> But once Wednesday is over, summer heat shows up. A building upper ridge of high pressure is sitting just off the coast and will offer up " considerable warming " to southwest Washington and northwest Oregon by Thursday. Forecasters for the National Weather Service predict a hot spell for Thursday through Saturday with temperatures at the coast reaching the mid 80s and valley temps up to 100. <p> Excessive heat watch NOAA <p> Yikes. <p> This pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night and Friday which could push temps at the coast into the lower-to-mid 90s at some locations. That 's not something you see every day. Those who escape to the coast during hot spells will be sorely disappointed this time around. <p> By Sunday the ridge should start to break down and most areas should see reduced temperatures back into the mid 80s.
