3052741 <p> The Milby Buffs are trying to survive a stretch of District 19-5A play without Duane Perkins, their 6-5 starting forward who was struck in the upper right arm by a stray bullet Sunday in a random drive-by shooting. <p> Perkins, who works at a Subway sandwich store on Sundays after church, was closing shop last week when someone started pumping bullets into the store from a passing car. <p> " " I did n't know what was happening, " said Perkins, who is also on the honor roll in the science and math magnet program at Milby. " " I just ran to the back of the store. I did n't even know I was shot until I noticed the blood on the floor. But it was just one of those random things. Someone just felt like it. " <p> Perkins is expected back Jan. 20, unless doctors opt for surgery to remove the slug that is still lodged in his arm -- a bullet that missed his heart by five inches. <p> " " I feel really blessed, " Perkins said. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was shot and all. " <p> And while Perkins, who leads the Buffs in rebounding( 9.7) and is the second-leading scorer( 11.7), did n't worry about his basketball career( " " That was the furthest thing from my mind when I got shot "), he has n't missed a beat in the classroom. <p> Perkins has come in every day to pick up the lesson plan for the day and does the schoolwork at home. <p> " " He did n't want to get his arm bumped in the halls, " said Milby coach Boyce Honea. " " But he did n't want to miss the schoolwork. He 's just a great student. " So good that Perkins is being courted by several Ivy League schools. <p> " " This just reinforces the value of academics, " Perkins said. " " You never know what can happen. And it 's mainly because of my dad( Gary). If I do n't keep a certain grade-point average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Plus I 've seen a lot of people who have the talent but did n't have the grades to go to college where they wanted. I did n't want to put myself in a predicament like that. " District 16-5A -- The Huntsville Hornets surpassed last year 's victory total when they beat Klein 52-48 for their 14th win of the season.

Memorial was 18-for-22 on two-pointers and 2-for-4 on 3-pointers and made seven of seven free throws. " " We just did n't get after them and make them do what we wanted them to do, " said Hastings coach Rick Sherley. " " We played their game -- spread it out and slow it down. That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee breaks into the top 15 with a 14-3 record, but has a tough test Friday when the Generals take on No. 5 Madison.

" District 23-5A -- Clear Creek lost to Pasadena 49-29 last Saturday, but had to play much of the game without senior guard Erick Kelley, who is averaging over 22 points for the Wildcats. <p> Kelley suffered an ankle injury in the second minute of the game when he was hit by a Pasadena player diving for a loose ball. To make matters worse, starting forward Jaron Banks was lost in the fourth quarter when he was knocked to the floor while going for a rebound and hurt his hip.
