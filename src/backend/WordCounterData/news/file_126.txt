3026441 <p> Kazuo Mutoh of Yokohama has a message for Detroit 's Big Three automakers : Build a car that meets my needs, and I 'll consider buying it. Not before. <p> " American automobile companies do not try, " says Mutoh, 37. " They do not make a car that 's good for Japan -( they 're) too big, use too much fuel, and there 's no right-side steering( wheel). " In Japan, as in England, you drive on the left side of the road. <p> Despite what some U.S. experts say, Japanese people do n't exhibit a deep- seated prejudice against U.S. products. <p> " I use an American computer - an Apple Macintosh. It 's very good. -So why not an American car? " says Tetsuya Noguchi, 28, of Tokyo. <p> But Japanese consumers and car dealers agree that Detroit 's automakers are n't building cars that Japanese consumers would like to drive at a price they can afford. Only one company - Japan 's Honda - ships right-hand-drive cars from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the USA must be repainted to meet Japanese consumers ' tastes. Hence, U.S. companies have a paltry 0.4% share of the Japanese auto market. <p> " The top thing for the Japanese consumer is quality, " says Yosuke Iwasaki, owner of an Autorama Ford dealership in the Waterfront district. " The quality of Japanese cars is higher.... U.S.-built models have more troubles. " <p> Many U.S. models are simply too bulky for Japan 's narrow roads and pint- size parking spaces. In Tokyo, for instance, a resident who bought a U.S. car might have to shell out several thousand dollars a year because the car uses two parking spaces instead of one. <p> U.S. automakers are starting to tackle those drawbacks. Ford announced Tuesday that it will install right-hand drive on its subcompact 1993 Probe sports coupe, and several other right-hand-drive models will follow. GM President Lloyd Reuss says his company will build right-hand-drive Saturns by the late 1990s. Later this year, Chrysler will offer a right-hand-drive version of the Jeep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news provided ammunition for President Bush and the chairmen of the Big Three, who are in Japan trying to arm-twist the Japanese into buying more U.S. cars. <p> But the problems associated with selling U.S. cars in Japan are deeply rooted and wo n't disappear soon. U.S. models carry stiff price premiums, typically because of markups by the independent distributors who arrange to import U.S. cars and resell them to dealers. For instance, a top-of-the-line Eddie Bauer version of the Ford Explorer sport-utility truck sits in Iwasaki 's showroom with a price of 5.08 million yen, about $ 41,000. The same truck costs about $ 25,000 in the USA. <p> Across town, at the Honda Welcome Plaza in the high-rent Aoyoma district, a Chrysler Jeep Cherokee Laredo Limited has a sticker of 5.25 million yen, about $ 42,000 - close to twice its U.S. price tag. <p> Prices above 5 million yen spook Japanese consumers, say experts at BMW, the German automaker that is considered a pioneer in opening Japan 's market to imports. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell enough Fords to solve the U.S.- Japan trade imbalance all by himself, says U.S. automakers also sin by overlooking their strong suit : They are from a country the Japanese admire. His most popular U.S.-built Ford, he says, is the Taurus station wagon. Despite its wrong-side steering and less-reliable reputation, " it fits the Japanese image of Americans always taking trips - it is a taste of America. When Japanese become rich, they want to load up their wagon and head for the resort, like they imagine Americans do. Japanese still have this romantic image of American things and have a desire for them. They are hungry for that taste of America. " <p> If Ford would ship superhigh-quality Taurus wagons with steering wheels on the right side to him, Iwasaki says, " sales would explode. " Likewise if Ford would put its heart into converting the rough-and-tumble Explorer for Japanese use. <p> The Explorer is a good example of another problem, he says. Ford should make the commitment to supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must buy Explorers - at inflated prices - from independent distributors who import them without Ford 's blessing. That 's why he has to charge so much. <p> Distributing their own vehicles in Japan is n't appealing to U.S. automakers because of the frightening costs, says Joseph Cappy, who runs Chrysler 's international operations. " For one thing, land is $ 30,000 a square foot. There 's no way, " he says. <p> Other manufacturers have taken that plunge and think it will pay off eventually. <p> " There are no barriers( to foreign-car sales) in the normal sense. They all came down in the past few years. You 've just got to do a goddam good selling job, " says Peter Woods, president of Rover Japan Limited. Woods, also chairman of the Automobile Committee of the European Business Community, has been selling British and French cars here since 1985. <p> By spending on land and huge parts inventories to become its own distributor and by meticulously fine-tuning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to get the paint, the glass and the trim into nearly perfect shape - Rover Japan has pushed its yearly sales from 2,000 in 1985 to 17,400 in 1990. That fell to 14,000 last year as the Japanese car market shrank for the first time in a decade. The Big Three combined to sell slightly more cars in Japan. In 1990, GM shipped 8,514 cars to Japan, Ford 6,031 and Chrysler 1,432. <p> To stay alive in the car business here, Woods says, " you 've got to overcome conservatism of consumers bred by 35 years of protectionism, and you 've got to figure 10 years to build up the franchise and the reputation. " <p> U.S. automakers eager to crack the Japanese market might get help from Japanese automakers. <p> Toyota has offered its extensive Japanese dealer network for use by any U.S. maker that wants it. Mazda has pledged to sell more Fords through its Autorama dealerships. And Honda says it will hustle harder to sell Chrysler 's Jeep models. <p> GM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant change on Toyota 's part, and we 're pleased, and we 'll talk with them. " <p> But the Big Three wo n't be satisfied until sales to Japan improve. <p> " We obviously have to have more than just a promise, " says Reuss. " We need physical signs. The real question is : When will the market open up? " <p> Contributing : Micheline Maynard CUTLINE : GAME PLAN : Bush at grand opening of Toys R Us in Kashihara, Japan.
