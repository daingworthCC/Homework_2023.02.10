3044141 <p> Death penalty foes ca n't justify stance <p> I remain baffled by attorneys and opponents of the death penalty. Their challenges on the constitutionality of executions will be presented whether it be the electric chair, gas, lethal injection or any future means. <p> So there were some difficulties inserting the IVs during two previous executions. Can opponents truly rationalize this as torture? Torture is what 11-year-old Christie Ann Griffith faced as Byron Parker raped and strangled her. <p> In the old days, if you stole, you lost a hand. If you ran, you lost a foot. If you killed, you were stoned, hanged or beheaded in the middle of town. An eye for an eye, so to speak. Lying on a padded table and getting poked with a needle is getting off easy. BILL ABERSON, Woodstock <p> A menace that devours society <p> The decline of our civilization continues as TV brings us more vulgarity, profanity and sexual material. Pornography is so pervasive today that nobody can avoid it. Many adults are disgusted at the degradation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endured a flood of pornography, and the harmful effects are clear for everyone to see : broken homes, illegitimate births, sexual diseases, promiscuity and an entertainment media that resembles an open sewer. It seems obvious that censorship of pornography is not only justified but necessary if our nation is to remain great. BILL WHITLOW, Snellville <p> Do n't give corporations a break <p> What in the world is a stimulus package? Is it designed to kick-start a stalled economy? Why is the economy stalled? After a decade of freewheeling, free-market capitalism, why ca n't big business weather a little ol ' recession? What about their cash reserves? <p> The Republicans, in particular, hate government. They ca n't stand the thought of any kind of socialism, except when it serves their purpose. The advocates of tax breaks can make you dizzy with formulas and figures designed to justify their claims. In good conscience they would take every dollar from the Social Security fund if given the opportunity. <p> Give billions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socialistic can we become? CLARENCE NEWTON, Young Harris <p> Natural gas : Proposals are impractical <p> The natural gas providers ' financial analysts woke up and realized that with 2 1/2 months of winter left and temperatures in the 70s, their chance to capitalize on artificially high retail gas prices is passing them by. <p> How can gas users who could n't pay last year 's bill of several hundred dollars somehow now afford to pay as much as $400 to get reconnected? <p> Plus, Atlanta Gas Light admits that with current personnel, they can reconnect only 5,000 homes a week. It would take 10 weeks to reconnect 50,000 homes, and winter will be over by then. <p> Their offer is way late and not practical financially. A $50 reconnection fee and payback of arrearage starting next April is the answer. No other charges. RICHARD MATHIS, Lawrenceville <p> Senior citizens shortchanged <p> Last winter my marketer sent me a bill for a past due amount. I sent the marketer the payment receipt. The marketer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketer to tell me the month that I did n't pay. The marketer ignored my request but kept sending bills with additional fees. <p> On April 3, 2001, I sent the marketer a certified letter, requesting that my gas be shut off after my April 13 payment. The marketer sent me a card to tell me that I would not receive any more bills. I never used any gas after April, but the marketer did n't turn off the gas until Nov. 27. <p> I think front-line employees deliberately make errors when billing senior citizens. The marketers have some housecleaning to do, because a dirty house is not going to stand. GEORGE WESTBROOK, Atlanta <p> GOOD NEIGHBORS : Teacher tops as role model <p> I am the proud parent of Russell Owens, who attends Sammye E. Coan Middle School. My son is in the eighth grade, with a 4.0 grade-point average. He is chief-editor of the newspaper staff and is president of both the Beta Club and the student government. <p> Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band director for Coan Middle School and has been teaching for 22 years. He has been named " Teacher of the Year " three times. My son has had nothing but positive things to say of Hill. I owe part thanks to Hill for my son 's being where he is right now. <p> We need more teachers like Paul Hill ; he is truly an asset to Sammye E. Coan Middle School and the Atlanta Public Schools. TONETTE OWENS, Atlanta <p> Honesty is appreciated <p> I wish to thank the lady who, on Dec. 3, turned my purse over to the cashier at Kohl 's in Snellville. <p> As I was trying on sweater coats in front of a mirror in one of the aisles, I set my purse on the floor. I went to hang up the unwanted merchandise and forgot the purse. The lady had already left the store so I could n't thank her in person. <p> Thank you, dear lady, for being honest, and God bless you. DOROTHY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A big thank you to Jerry Autry of the Duluth Post Office. In this time of anxiety about the security of our postal system, he went the extra mile( actually about five miles) to retrieve for me a batch of letters that I had inadvertently deposited without postage in an office park mailbox. <p> I expected only to be able to meet the carrier when the mail was picked up from the box and place the necessary postage on each letter. Autry went to the box, got the letters, then called me and told me I could pick them up at the Duluth Post Office and stamp them. <p> Above and beyond, sir, and I thank you. Happy holidays! PAT BRANNON, Duluth <p> Religion : Look for ways to affirm faith <p> Over and over I read in the Journal-Constitution of the struggle of true believers confronting the paradox of their religion. If we believe, as I do, that our faith is the one true way to a relationship with God, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differing faith is the one, true way? <p> Two answers are usually proposed, neither of which is satisfactory to me : First, proselytize those who believe differently( which denies their beliefs). And second, say that everyone has a right to their beliefs( which denies my beliefs). <p> Perhaps we can not come to terms with this paradox intellectually. Perhaps we must acknowledge that true belief involves an experience of the presence and love of God that is not logical or marketable. This makes it ultimately private at the same time that it is set within a culture and tradition. <p> Therefore, let us be careful not to leave one another alone, but affirm faith wherever we hear of it and see it in action. At the same time, in light of recent tragic events, we must be just as careful not to affirm any fanatical faith that crosses the line from love to hatred -- of oneself or others. WALTRAUT STEIN, Decatur <p> Only Christianity addresses sin issue <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the only way to God. None of the other religions deals with the sin issue except Christianity, and it must be dealt with, or humanity 's view of heaven would be no different from what we experience on this side of eternity. <p> Jesus dealt with sin. Christians know that Jesus lived a sinless life for 33 years when he allowed himself to be put on the cross and become a sacrifice for all the sins that were committed before he came, for all the sins that were being committed when he was here and for all the sins that were to be committed after he ascended to heaven upon his resurrection from the dead. And it is the faith in believing these important foundations of faith that open the doors of heaven to Christians. <p> Other religions teach that God will let you into his heaven if you earn it. That is not what Christians believe, nor what the Bible teaches. If people are offended by what Christians say about Jesus being the only way to heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus on the cross and the people who shouted to put him on the cross were offended by this teaching, too. <p> GAIL HAYES, Buford <p> Unbelievers on slippery slope <p> Regarding Christianity and Islam : Of course the opinions of the six anti-Christ letter-writers were deliberate and reflect the far left liberal views of the Journal-Constitution. <p> I would like to re-emphasize that Rev. James Merritt spoke of Jesus Christ being the only way to God. All other ways of entry into heaven apart from Jesus Christ are false. <p> In essence, it is not Merritt who offended the unbelievers, but God. The unbelievers require a social, religiously correct religion to accommodate all those who desire to be accountable and committed to nobody. <p> If they continue in their sins, they 're doomed. MEL ROYAL, Atlanta <p> Christians just being obedient <p> Regarding the Rev. James Merritt 's column and the debate over Christianity vs. other belief systems : Opponents of Christianity are incensed when Christians such as Merritt claim that every other religion gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Christians are merely obeying the words of Christ, who as the Holy Bible states, was God incarnate. So if someone disputes this claim, they must ultimately take it up with God, rather than pointing fingers at Christians as close-minded bigots who have made this viewpoint up. ALLEN ALLNOCH, Bluffton, S.C. <p> Addiction to war against Jesus ' teachings <p> I hope people who oppose war know that they are not alone in their frustration with what appears to be a human addiction to war. This violence no doubt stems from a hunger for power and from each faction, religion and country viewing itself as separate and better than the others. If we wholeheartedly followed the teachings and example of Christ, we would truly be a compassionate, peacemaking society. <p> It takes real courage to believe and act against the status quo for the betterment of the planet. Let 's look to Mahatma Gandhi and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as role models, rather than Napoleon and Gen. George Patton. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye leaves us all blind. SONIA ABEL, Atlanta
