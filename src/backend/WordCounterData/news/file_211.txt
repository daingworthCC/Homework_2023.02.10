3040841 <p> New York - It will come as no surprise - except perhaps to someone who believes that real life is a Rodgers &; Hammerstein musical - that the just-concluded Broadway season had a far less fairy-tale ending than the previous one. With a paltry 28 new productions and an audience of just 7.2 million, the season could be subtitled " Back to Reality - The Broadway Tragedy Continues. " <p> Yet there is this wisp of hope for a new Broadway beginning : Two recently opened productions, " Tommy " and " Angels in America, " have a nervy edge of hipness usually confined to the lower-profile arenas of off- Broadway and regional theater. They point toward a new sensibility, a new aesthetic in the theater 's most backward-looking and commercialized sector. <p> " Angels, " Tony Kushner 's magnificent and provocative self-styled " Gay Fantasia on National Themes, " is generating great arousal in the media without any moonlighting movie stars. And " Tommy, " the rock opera completely re-imagined to excite even those born since the Who 's 1969 album, represents the musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tommy " performances are already heavily sold months in advance, but no one knows yet how well the unprecedented " Angels " will sell.) <p> But back to the bad news for a moment because, unfortunately, it outweighs the good. <p> You know a season is in trouble when " Blood Brothers "( in which " deadly gunplay " makes viewers laugh out loud) and " The Goodbye Girl "( in which Bernadette Peters looks pained enough to say goodbye to the production at any moment) are nominated for the Tony Award for best musical. That 's the kind of nutty thing that happens in a season when there are less than half as many openings as there were in Broadway 's golden age of the 1940s and ' 50s, and there are only six musicals from which to draw four nominees. Even Broadway 's official booster and front man, Harvey Sabinson of the League of New York Theaters and Producers, is forced to agree : " We did n't get the overall quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either. After " Angels " and Wendy Wasserstein 's sparkling comedy, " The Sisters Rosensweig, " there were only warm bodies, so to speak - " The Song of Jacob Zulu " and " Someone Who 'll Watch Over Me " - to fill out the two remaining Tony nominations. <p> The previous season, on the other hand, had four equally worthy potential winners for best musical, led by " Guys and Dolls. " In fact, the fluky flourish of good shows in the final months of that season( " Broadway 's Back " was the premature exclamation of many headlines), added on top of such long-runners as " The Phantom of the Opera " and " Miss Saigon, " continued to sell so well during the past 12 months that they boosted the 1992-93 attendance well above the 1991-92 mark of 6.5 million - in effect, masking the box-office weakness of this season 's shows. <p> But how long can a chronic illness be masked? It 's the illness of longtime economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn makes tickets too expensive( $ 65 for top musicals on weekend nights) for the middle class, which in turn narrows the audience and media visibility of theater driving much of the talent to films and TV, which are more lucrative. And the economic-creative malaise is now just as bad in the nonprofit sector of off-Broadway and regional theaters, so the flow of new material toward Broadway has slowed drastically. <p> But the malaise is partly, again, masked by the last-minute rush of new productions from March through early May, capitalizing on the spring tourist trade, the box-office boost from Tony nominations and the TV exposure of the Tony telecast in June. Molly Dwartzman, a spokeswoman for the Marriott Marquis - the massive hotel-theater complex in the heart of the theater district - says, " It 's becoming more a spring-summer theater season than the fall-winter season of the old days - partly because the city has been promoting theater in its push for summer tourism. " <p> Jim Freydberg, producer of the acclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( which opened in February), calls the syndrome a cynical " Tony Game " : " You 've got producers who are not full- time producers with other business interests, who are only in it for the awards. But the spring logjam can backfire at the box office. The word is we 'll see a revival of business in the fall. " Playwright Wasserstein, whose " Sisters Rosensweig " opened as an off- Broadway hit in the fall and returned as a Broadway hit in March, agrees that the season may recover its balance : " There 's something to be said for doing plays in the fall, since it 's now an open field. " <p> Another malaise - an open secret constantly discussed in private but never in print - is the perception that the many gay artists in the theater are losing touch with the straights of their audience - and losing them, period. The complaints were reignited when the " gay Richard III " scene in " Goodbye Girl, " which brought such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurdly rewritten as a virtually laughless " Richard as a woman pretending he 's a man. " And yet it 's hard to imagine that anyone who 's seen such fine gay-themed Broadway shows as " Angels " and " Kiss of the Spider Woman " and 1992 's " Falsettos " could deny their universal quality or claim that they devalue straightness in any way <p> Patrons can make a stronger case that Broadway is Theater of the Old, with little to say to the young. Which is why " Tommy " marks such an important turn. <p> Its consortium of producers says a lot about the new alliances being forged for shows that must creatively reach new audiences. The group represents some of the best talent in the commercial theater( Dodger Productions, the baby-boomer types that produced the hip " Jelly 's Last Jam " and the dynamite " Guys and Dolls ") and the nonprofit theater( director Des McAnuff and his La Jolla Playhouse, winner of the ' 93 regional Tony). <p> The Dodgers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five of Broadway 's 30-odd theaters. Jujamcyn was the perennial unpronounceable underdog theater owner to the much larger Shubert and Nederlander organizations - until it captured the creative momentum in the past few seasons. <p> " We 're people who stay with the theater because we love its spirit and not just because we 're good at managing the buildings, " says Michael David, speaking both for his Dodger organization and Jujamcyn, its spiritual theater-owner ally. <p> At 50, the bushy-bearded Mr. David is the self-styled " old man " of the Dodgers, but one who wore out his " Tommy " album two decades ago. " Sometimes it 's our fatal flaw, but we produce stuff we really like ourselves, as opposed to things that we cynically figure can make a lot of money. I guess you could say we 're much more intimately involved in the complete development of new work for Broadway - we know how to ' hold the baby ' correctly. " <p> The success of producers such as Mr. David bodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come faster and stronger to save the ailing old man known as the Great White Way.
