4060441 THE sky is falling at voter registrar offices across the country! Or was that just an ACORN? <p> It 's hard to tell these days with breathless news reports blanketing airwaves and the Internet, spewing accusations of voter registration fraud in battleground states. <p> We 're told dead people are being signed up, along with Mickey Mouse and the starting lineup of the Dallas Cowboys - bogus registrations supposedly planted by the liberal-leaning community organizing group ACORN, or the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now. <p> Voter fraud is a perennial political boogeyman of the Republicans, similar to the way fears of rigged elections, registrars purging voters and ballot-stealing voter machines are employed by Democrats. Like a good rumor, they persist because they 're based on a kernel of truth. <p> There 's no doubt that each election cycle, ACORN hires canvassers who end up turning in bogus registration cards. <p> But large-scale conspiracy this does not appear to be. These paid canvassers, many low income folks themselves, are more likely motivated to pad their stacks to collect a paycheck than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> But even if investigations in other states do turn up evidence of a coordinated effort to commit fraud, Harris County apparently has nothing to fear. <p> " There 's no Dallas Cowboys football team. President Roosevelt has not been re-registered. We 've done a cursory check, " says Paul Bettencourt, Harris County voter registrar. <p> In fact, Bettencourt, a Republican, says he has a healthy relationship with ACORN. When there 's a problem, he meets with the group 's officials to work it out. And there have been problems this election cycle. <p> Felons can vote <p> First, there was an issue of ACORN canvassers signing up felons, which, unlike in some other states, is perfectly legal in Texas, just so long as the felons have completed their sentencing terms. The problem was some ACORN canvassers were frequenting halfway houses, resulting in about 230 registration cards for felons who were n't yet eligible to vote, according to Bettencourt. But he says once he raised the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Then there were the two ACORN deputy registrars who tried to register themselves eight times each. Both were fired, and ACORN 's state political director Catherine Blue told me one was dismissed before Bettencourt 's office called to report her. <p> The problem of duplicate cards has been worse this year than in past election cycles, Bettencourt says, though he had a little trouble quantifying it. He told a Chronicle reporter and me that ACORN had submitted 4,600 duplicates this year up until Oct. 8, but when he ran the numbers to get an updated figure Wednesday, he corrected the record : Only 3,791 duplicates. <p> 30,000 ACORN registrations <p> Of more than 30,000 ACORN-submitted registration cards, Bettencourt says 61 percent actually were successful in adding registered voters to the rolls. Not a bad showing when you consider that many of these duplicates are well-intentioned mistakes, the result of people who ca n't remember if they 've registered, or they still have n't received their voter registration card in the mail, so they fill out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bogus voter registration applications and real, Election Day voter fraud. <p> " Registering over and over is not fraud, " Bettencourt says. "... it 's just a bogus waste of time. " <p> And the chances of the bogusness leading to Election Day fraud? <p> " The odds are higher than zero. That 's really all you can say, " Bettencourt says. <p> Of course, the duplicates and ineligible felons waste the time of the county employees who have to sift through them. And they waste taxpayer money that funds the employees salaries. Bettencourt argues that ACORN could reduce its error rate if it used volunteer canvassers instead of paid ones. ACORN 's Blue says using volunteers is n't a feasible option for a large-scale operation aimed at the most hard-to-register group : minority, low-income, historically disenfranchised voters. <p> But the errors are a waste of time, and money, for ACORN 's privately funded campaign, too. " We have no interest in turning in bogus cards. Those folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blue said. Blue says ACORN has quality control measures, such as calling three times to verify applications, to crack down on bogus applications, but the organization is legally required to turn in every card. When that happens, though, Blue says, " We turn it in with big, glaring, flashing lights all over it saying we suspect that this card is a problem. " <p> There 's no motivation for ACORN to pay people to sit on a street corner and register cartoon characters, quarterbacks or their own names multiple times. The cartoons, quarterbacks and multiple personalities wo n't be able to vote on Election Day. <p> The only clear motivation in the supposed battleground state scandals is political. <p> It 's the same scare tactic used in 2005 when former Republican state Rep. Talmadge Heflin blamed Democratic challenger Hubert Vo 's razor-thin victory 's on voter fraud. Unfortunately for him, the even-handed Republican investigating the allegations, state Rep. Will Hartnett, R-Dallas, found no evidence to back the powerful former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And let 's not forget the role of voter fraud in the infamous U.S. attorney firings scandal that helped take down former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. <p> A recent Justice Department inspector general report detailed how David Iglesias, New Mexico 's former U.S. attorney appointed by President Bush, got the boot because his fellow Republicans objected to the lack of zeal with which he handled voter fraud and public corruption cases against Democrats. <p> Iglesias had formed a bipartisan task force to investigate more than 100 claims of voter fraud, but it was n't good enough because it found no prosecutable cases. <p> Partisanship trumped the facts. <p> Same thing with the latest accusations. <p> of interest and either modify your search or search within the current results set
