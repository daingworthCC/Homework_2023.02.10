3030441 <p> Although it has dragged on for more than 11 weeks, the pilots ' strike at regional airline Comair has gone unnoticed by most travelers outside the airline 's home base in Cincinnati. <p> But behind the battle at Comair is a powerful economic trend that is quietly revolutionizing the industry -- and with it, the way many passengers will fly in the future. <p> At breakneck speed, major airlines are expanding their use of small, cheaper-to-operate " regional " jets. The majors are using regional jets to replace slow turboprops and larger, less-efficient jets on some routes, and to launch service to new cities. Within 5 years, regional jets will account for large blocks of most major airlines ' fleets, and now regional airline pilots want their pay to reflect the growing role. The strike is being closely watched : Its outcome is likely to redefine the economics of flying regional jets for airlines, employees and passengers. <p> Comair, which mainly flies 50-seat regional jets and feeds passengers to flights by parent Delta Air Lines, has been grounded since 1,350 pilots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the longest in the past 20 years. Comair and its pilots union, in contentious contract talks for 3 years, are meeting with the National Mediation Board in Washington this week in what may be a final effort to reach a deal. <p> Airlines have been snapping up small jets as fast as they can be built. About 1,000 such aircraft have been ordered by U.S. airlines for delivery during the next 5 years. According to one estimate, small jets could represent 40% or more of the total fleets operated by Delta and Continental by 2006 if those airlines buy all the regional jets they have on order and option. As a result : <p> * More travelers accustomed to full-size jets will find themselves in smaller regional jets flown by relatively young pilots. <p> * The growing use of regional jets will expand options for schedule-sensitive business travelers but could raise fares, too. That 's because smaller regional jets better match the demand from business travelers, who tend to book closer to departure and pay the highest fares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discounted for leisure travelers. <p> * The rapid influx of regional jets will add to air traffic congestion on the ground and in the air. <p> The regional-jet explosion " will change the dynamics of the industry, " says Tulinda Larsen, a former Regional Airline Association executive and now a consultant at Back Aviation Solutions. <p> " There are lots of opportunities for this industry -- provided regional jets can be operated economically, " says Peter Bowler, CEO of American Eagle, the USA 's largest regional airline. " That 's the crux of what Comair and its pilots are wrestling with now. " <p> When Comair began flying the first regional jets in 1993, they were hailed as a salvation by small and midsize cities left behind in the wake of airline deregulation. After deregulation, airlines abandoned unprofitable routes to small and midsize cities or replaced large jets with noisy, slower turboprop planes that many passengers disliked or feared were less safe. <p> Ironically, of the regional jets deployed since 1997, one-third have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or replace large jets on routes where they are more efficient to operate, a recent report by the General Accounting Office found. <p> The GAO found that the greatest beneficiaries of regional jets have been cities with populations greater than 250,000, such as Albuquerque, Nashville and Louisville. Those cities make up three-fourths of all U.S. cities getting regional-jet service today. Of the 157 cities served by regional jets last fall, when the report was being written, only 13 had fewer than 100,000 residents. <p> Comair was the first airline to replace turboprops with small jets, which fly more passengers faster and farther than propeller-driven aircraft. <p> And in 1999, Comair was one of the most profitable airlines ever, with an operating margin of 27% -- " astounding in the airline industry, " says consultant George Hamlin of Global Aviation Associates. To capture those profits and lock in Comair 's passengers, Delta bought Comair last year for $ 1.8 billion. Comair 's financial results are no longer separately reported. <p> The parent companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own regional carriers. Northwest owns part of Mesaba, one of its Northwest Airlink carriers. United contracts with Virginia-based Atlantic Coast Airlines. <p> Today, there are nearly 100 regional airlines operating small turboprops and jets to connect smaller cities with larger cities and airline hubs. The regionals carried 85 million people last year, 50% more than in 1995 and double 1990 's number. Before the strike, Comair was carrying 25,000 passengers daily between 95 cities in the USA, Mexico, Canada and the Bahamas. <p> Leaders of the Air Line Pilots Association at Comair say the airline owes much of its dizzying success to cheap labor. Before the strike, a first-year Comair pilot flying as first officer on a 50-seat jet was earning $ 15,000 a year on average. First-year captains with 3 years experience were starting at less than $ 50,000 --a long way from the $ 200,000- to $ 300,000-a-year salaries paid to many pilots at majors. <p> As fleets of regional jets expand, more passengers can expect to see pilots like Comair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miles, who flew for three other small airlines before joining Comair in 1998, made captain last December. At pre-strike scale, Miles would earn about $ 48,000 this year. <p> The union says Comair 's size, route structure, jet equipment and financial performance justify the basic perks and protections given to major-airline pilots : higher pay, a company-paid pension and a shorter workday, which lets pilots get more rest. Six to seven trips a day are n't unusual for a Comair pilot. <p> " The airline says we 're asking for the same thing as major-airline pilots, " says Comair Captain Cory Tennen, the union 's chief negotiator. " We 're not. We 're asking to be paid commensurate with the airplane we 're flying. " <p> Citing the sensitive talks, Comair canceled a USA TODAY interview this week with its president, Randy Rademacher. But Comair has said in the past that pilots ' demands would raise crew costs 85% over the life of the contract and damage the airline 's financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilots are likely to be demanded by pilots at Delta 's other regional airline, Atlanta-based Atlantic Southeast Airlines, as well as pilots unions at every other regional carrier. <p> " I get calls all the time from other regional airlines who are worried what will happen if we cave in, " Comair planning director Tim Zeis said recently. <p> UBS Warburg aviation analyst Jamie Baker agrees : " I believe the pilots are attempting to rewrite regional-jet economics. Absent lower wages, we will not see such a rapid regional-jet expansion. " <p> Expansion to date has been breathtaking. Major airlines and their regional affiliates fly more than 500 regional jets, up from 89 in 1997. More than 80% of the jets are 50-seaters built by Canada 's Bombardier or Brazil 's Embraer. And there would be even more regional jets flying if major airlines ' pilots unions -- fearful of losing jobs -- had n't negotiated limits on the number of small jets their carriers could operate. <p> In October 2000, there were about 94,000 scheduled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airline departures, but the number has soared 735% in 3 years. During that same period, jet departures by major airlines rose 9%, the GAO says. <p> While airlines have been rapidly retiring turboprops, regional jets have proven to be a far more versatile competitive weapon. Baker says half of new regional-jet routes added recently fall into the category of " hub-raiding " flights used to poach passengers on another major airline 's turf. <p> Delta-owned Atlantic Southeast, for example, started service between Atlanta and Corpus Christi, Texas, where Continental Airlines dominates. Continental Express started service between its home base of Houston and Savannah, Ga., a Delta town. <p> Across the USA, especially in the gridlocked Northeast, there 's growing concern that the infusion of regional jets will aggravate air-traffic congestion. Regional jets are designed to fly at the same altitudes as big jets, whereas turboprops that the regional jets are replacing fly lower, spreading out the traffic. And regional jets generally ca n't use the shorter runways that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large jets use. <p> At the end of 2000, there were about 120 daily regional-jet departures scheduled from LaGuardia, the GAO report found. That 's about 20% of all departures at LaGuardia, up 6 percentage points from a year ago, says Back Aviation Solutions. <p> Some experts worry that regional jets could be used on busy routes in an anti-competitive way. They could replace big jets, reducing available seats, driving up fares and restraining competition by tying up airport facilities -- such as takeoff and landing slots -- that could handle bigger aircraft. " This is a sea change in the use of regional jets, " says JayEtta Hecker, airline-competition expert at the GAO. <p> What happens at Comair could dramatically alter the outlook for regional jets and the carriers that use them. The strike has been costly. Comair has laid off 2,400 of its 4,000 non-striking employees and lost more than $ 300 million in revenue. <p> Even if the strike is settled soon, resuming Comair flights could takes weeks, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Meanwhile, other regional airlines are hovering, ready to swoop in on Comair 's routes from Cincinnati if the strike continues or Comair shuts down. <p> " The industry is not going to sit back and take a hands-off approach for long, " Baker says. <p> *** <p> Contributing : Chris Woodyard <p> TEXT WITHIN GRAPHICS BEGINS HERE <p> What 's a regional jet? <p> How a typical regional jet compares with one of the most popular large jet models being flown today. <p> Embraer ERJ 145 <p> Length : 98 ft. <p> Wingspan : 65 ft., 9 in. <p> Passengers : 50 <p> Cruising speed : 518 mph <p> Range : 1,783 miles <p> Boeing 737-700 <p> Length : 110 ft., 4 in. <p> Wingspan : 112 ft., 7 in. <p> Passengers : 126-149+1 <p> Cruising speed : 530 mph <p> Range : 3,752 miles <p> 1- Depends on class configuration ; <p> Source : Embraer, Boeing <p> Airlines embrace regional jets <p> Regional airlines that are partners with major carriers are expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years.
