3042341 <p> " Between 1539 and 1543 Hernando de Soto led a small army on a desperate journey of exploration of almost four thousand miles throug the southeastern quadrant of the United States. According to Spanis usage, Hernando de Soto should be referred to as Soto, but to Englis speakers he is De Soto, and that is what he shall be called here. The name De Soto is perhaps known to people of the older generation because the Chrysler Corporation named a now defunct line of automobiles after him. Most others know him as the Spanis conquistador who discovered the Mississippi River, died there, and was interred in its waters. For the most part, De Soto has been cast as a romantic hero by American artists, as in William H. Powell 's depiction of him discovering the Mississippi River in a painting that hangs in the capitol in Washington, D.C. ; by novelists, as in Andrew Lytle 's ' At the Moon 's Inn ' ; and by poets, as in Lily Peter 's ' Great Riding : The Story of De Soto in America. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any notion of De Soto as a romantic hero.
