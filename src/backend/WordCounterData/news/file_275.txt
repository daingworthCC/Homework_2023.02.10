3048641 <p> In its grand plan to go to San Francisco International Airport, BART faces a gantlet of opposition : neighborhood organizations, feuding transit agencies and Congress. <p> But if the proposed airport stop is ever to get off the ground, there is another major, if unlikely, roadblock -- Artichoke Joe 's Casino and its influential owner, Dennis Sammut. <p> To opponents of the airport plan, Sammut is one of many potential victims of BART 's controversial expansion. To supporters, he is the opposition. And they suggest that he is the mastermind behind the Coalition for a One Stop Terminal, the most active organization opposing the BART project. <p> " Do I support( the coalition)? You 're goddamn right I do, " Sammut says of the group that includes several Peninsula city officials and transit advocates. " Does that mean I control them? No. " <p> Certainly Sammut has an interest in opposing the $ 1.2 billion BART plan to take trains down the Peninsula corridor to Millbrae. <p> The project 's path happens to pass through San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking lot used primarily by Artichoke Joe 's customers and employees. With neighboring Colma about to open a new casino, Sammut is feeling pressure. <p> " No parking, no business -- you 're dead, " said Sammut of his casino, a San Bruno institution that started 80 years ago as a bar and pool room built by Sammut 's grandfather. " They 're gon na plow a trench right through this town. " <p> Sammut has spent nearly $ 300,000, according to public records, mobilizing a battery of lawyers, lobbyists and planners to fight the project. He donated $ 2,000 in seed money to the Coalition for a One Stop Terminal when it was formed last year. The group 's executive director, Bruce Balshone, is a consultant to Sammut on loan to the group. Jon Twichell, a transit planning consultant who is a member of the association 's volunteer board, also works for Sammut. <p> " You might say I 'm the Ross Perot of this BART thing, " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent the money. I 'm proud I 'm standing up against mismanagement. " <p> Sammut is no stranger to checkbook politics. He has spent at least $ 90,000 to influence state lawmakers in the past five years, including about $ 50,000 for lobbyists to work the Capitol and a $ 14,000 contribution to former Assembly Speaker Willie Brown in 1994. <p> In San Bruno, Sammut 's role in the opposition poses a major dilemma for city officials, most of whom endorse the BART project. George Foscardo, the city 's director of planning and building, said they are finding it harder to prepare the city for BART 's arrival because of Sammut 's position. <p> " It impacts our dealings with BART and creates delays, " he said. " Every time we deal with BART, we 're reacting to a Dennis Sammut proposal instead of getting a clear consensus of what the citizens of San Bruno want. " <p> But city officials concede that Sammut has legitimate concerns about the project -- and that BART has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> To be sure, it 's in San Bruno 's interest to help Sammut stay in business. Sammut is the city 's biggest individual taxpayer and one of its most generous citizens -- he has donated thousands to San Bruno sporting leagues, its library and parks. <p> " Dennis has been very good to this city, " Foscardo said. " We disagree on this issue. But it 's issue- oriented. " <p> * -- -- <p> Aside from the Coalition for a One Stop Terminal, Dennis Sammut has dished out thousands more on other anti-BART campaigns. <p> In June 1995, for example, Sammut took out a $ 22,000 full- page ad in The Chronicle opposing the BART extension signed by local officials and transit advocates, some of them association members. <p> And when BART solicited comments and questions from the public on the draft environmental impact report, Sammut hired a battery of lawyers, lobbyists and planning consultants to submit hundreds of pages of questions and comments. <p> Sammut admits to spending at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact, he has spent at least $ 260,000 on a Washington lobbying outfit to derail federal funding for the BART project, according to congressional records. <p> BART supporters consider Sammut a major headache. <p> " It shows you how much money there is in gambling, " said state Senator Quentin Kopp, an ardent BART-to-the-airport supporter who has accused Sammut of using his financial muscle to buttress opposition to the project. <p> Representative Bill Baker, another BART supporter, jokingly referred to the Coalition for a One Stop Terminal campaign -- focused on the project 's potential environmental damage -- as a fight for an " environmental cardroom. " <p> Association executive director Balshone countered that BART supporters are bad-mouthing Sammut because of what he does for a living, adding : " If he were making widgets in San Bruno, nobody would give a damn. " <p> * -- -- <p> Ironically, Sammut was once one of the BART airport extension 's ardent backers, because of the project 's potential economic benefits for San Bruno. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sammut envisioned a one-stop terminal not in Millbrae, but in San Bruno, where BART, CalTrain and a planned airport light- rail system would meet -- and spark a massive downtown development. Foscardo said Sammut even referred to a revitalized San Bruno as the " Disneyland of the North. " <p> Among his proposals was building a BART station on his property -- a plan that would have meant the relocation of Artichoke Joe 's and possibly a huge profit for Sammut. <p> Sammut denies that he wanted to make money out of the deal, saying he offered to give up his property in exchange for $ 1 and a new building in another part of town. <p> San Bruno planner Foscardo said he had not heard of such an offer. Besides, after BART opted to take another route, Sammut 's proposals never advanced to a stage where such payments had to be discussed. <p> If Sammut had prevailed, Foscardo said, BART would have paid " an astronomical price " to relocate his cardroom. <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out, " he said. " He explores every option. He is a businessman with the revenues to exhaust all the alternatives.... Hopefully, we can put this behind us, and Dennis will be all right. " <p> * -- -- <p> Early this year, San Bruno tried to negotiate the Artichoke Joe 's parking problem with BART. The transit agency agreed to pitch in $ 2 million to replace parking spaces that will be lost during the construction -- but only if Sammut agreed not to file a lawsuit against the project. <p> The negotiations fell through. <p> Sammut said he simply did not believe that BART could make good on its promises because the project 's financing is still uncertain. Like other critics, he fears that BART could be forced to cut corners, and eventually would pass on the financial burden to San Mateo County residents. <p> For example, BART 's much- publicized proposal to build a tunnel at the airport was rejected by Congress as being too expensive. Sammut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground at the airport but include a tunnel through downtown San Bruno to reduce the impact on businesses there -- could suffer the same fate. <p> " Wrangling with BART is like trying to nail Jell-O to a tree, " said Sammut 's attorney, Bo Links. " They say one thing one day and another another day. We have too much at stake to put our fates in their hands. " <p> Sammut 's distrust grew last year when, he says, San Bruno officials and BART reneged on a promise to make sure that tunneling would occur under downtown streets. San Bruno planner Foscardo denied that there was ever such a commitment. <p> But the issue is crucial for Sammut. Tunneling under San Bruno streets would have spared downtown businesses the havoc aboveground construction would wreak. Instead, BART plans to dig up city streets to build the underground tunnel. <p> Sammut imagines a construction cacophony and convoys of dirt-filled trucks rumbling right past his casino. <p> " This is going to put us out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dan Richard said BART recognizes Sammut 's problem, but stressed that the agency tried to work with him -- and that Sammut simply did n't want to cooperate. <p> " We tried to see whether there was a way to settle it, " Richard said. " We went as far as we could go. " <p> * -- -- <p> Like the Coalition for a One Stop Terminal, Sammut says he does not totally oppose an airport extension. But he considers BART 's current $ 1.2 billion plan to build a station at the airport and extend its line all the way to Millbrae too expensive and impractical. <p> Sammut shares the association 's vision : a station near the airport west of Highway 101 where passengers could connect with BART, CalTrain or light rail. <p> In the meantime, he is bracing himself for what 's ahead. <p> Congress recently approved financing for the BART project in next year 's budget. Although the agency received only about a third of the $ 87 million it requested for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign a full-funding agreement with the government this year. <p> Sammut said he is keeping his options open on whether to sue BART. He also is making plans to build a new parking lot and move Artichoke Joe 's front entrance. <p> But like Ross Perot in his bid for the presidency, Sammut is also preparing himself for what could be the inevitable. <p> " If they win, they win, " he said. " God help us. I 'm going to be guy standing on the side saying, ' I told you so. ' "
