5021941 <p> How can that be after only two games? The stats show only 12 percent of all teams that start 0-2 make the playoffs. <p> Common sense reveals this : If a rookie head coach on a team with high expectations loses his home opener 43-13( with 18 penalties) and then loses his second game to a dismal team with a third-string QB, what does that say about his future? <p> So, Kitchens and Browns fans do n't have to face that question. <p> I know, it was an ugly victory against a weak team decimated by injuries. But there was never a point in the game where I thought the Browns would lose, especially when they escaped the first quarter with only a pair of penalties. <p> But there was a bigger issue looming. I wondered if Kitchens would address it when I asked him a question after the game. <p> He did. <p> " This was a tough week in a lot of areas for our team, " he said. " We 've come together and we 're tighter than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team would bounce back after the embarrassing, undisciplined and ill-prepared home opener. But the truth is, he did n't know. No one did. <p> The Browns have some new key players. They are dealing with big expectations under a rookie head coach. That made it hard to predict would happen at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. <p> " With adversity, you either run from it or you run towards each other, " said Kitchens. " We ran toward each other a little bit. We ran toward each other. " <p> Along with the victory, that was the most important aspect of the Browns Monday night game. <p> A NEW BALLGAME <p> For the second week in a row, the Browns( 1-1) will be on national TV on Sunday night( 8:20 p.m., NBC). This time, it will be at home. And this time, they face the Rams( 2-0), who lost in the Super Bowl last season. <p> Rams quarterback Jared Goff is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game Monday night for the Jets. Goff is one of the best QBs in the NFL. <p> The Browns need another huge game from Myles Garrett( 5 sacks already), but fewer penalties from their star defensive end. They also need some consistent pressure on opposing QBs from someone other than Garrett. <p> It 's strange to be asking more of a defense where Garrett had as many sacks( 3) as the Jets had points. But I flashed back to the Tennessee game where the Browns faced a decent QB( Marcus Mariota) and struggled. <p> Meanwhile, Goff and the Rams loom. <p> THE REAL CONCERN <p> Baker Mayfield was 19-of-35 passing for 325 yards and an 83.6 rating Monday. Maybe it shows how spoiled we 're becoming when those numbers are looked at with questionable eyes. <p> Odell Beckham Jr. certainly helped with his 89-yard TD catch. The pass traveled about 10 yards in the air. Beckham did his lightning bolt imitation to reach the end zone on his old home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stadium. <p> NextGen stats clocked Beckham running fast enough to earn a speeding ticket in a school zone. The radar gun number was 21.7 mph. That 's supposed to be the third fastest football sprint this season. <p> No idea if that 's true. <p> My big concern is keeping Beckham healthy. He cramped up during the game. He complained of a tight hamstring. He has missed 16 of 32 games in the previous two seasons because of various leg injuries. <p> The other issue is Mayfield. He had two passes tipped by defenders at the line of scrimmage. He was sacked three more times. <p> The offense and passing game lacks flow. Mayfield is n't as decisive as a year ago. More than once, Mayfield said, " We absolutely have to play better. " <p> He talked about the " need to finish drives, get touchdowns and not settle for field goals... I have to play better. " <p> He 's right. He does. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early in the game. Nick Chubb ripped off a 19-yard TD. He did n't seem to have a lot of room to run, finishing with only 62 yards on 18 carries. The run-blocking has to to improve. <p> " It 's been frustrating at times, " admitted Mayfield. <p> And against the Rams, what the Browns have shown so far is not good enough. That 's the big lesson from the first two weeks, hopefully creating a sense of urgency for Sunday 's game.
