3046541 <p> AT FIRST glance, the actor and the role seem poles apart. On the one hand is Gerard Depardieu, a burly French film star who frequently plays lusty slobs. On the other hand is Cyrano de Bergerac, one of literature 's great poetic figures -- a 17th century romantic with a nose the size of a flatbed truck. <p> The casting seems bizarre, but it works remarkably well in " Cyrano de Bergerac, " a lavish film that opens Wednesday at the Bridge Theater. A huge hit in France, where it opened last March, " Cyrano " won two awards at this year 's Cannes Film Festival -- one for Pierre Lhomme 's cinematography, the other for Depardieu 's surprisingly delicate performance. <p> Certain to be mentioned on several critics ' 10-best lists, " Cyrano " was directed by France 's Jean-Paul Rappeneau, a stage and opera veteran with little film experience. During a recent conversation in Toronto, Rappeneau discussed Depardieu, the origins of " Cyrano, " and the problems inherent in transfering a well-loved, but verbose and antiquated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of 58, impeccably dressed, Rappeneau spoke through an interpreter. " When I proposed Depardieu, many people thought it was a baroque idea, " he said. " But I had seen all his movies, and when I was reading the script I imagined him doing it ; I could hear his voice. The character is very strong but also vulnerable, soft. Depardieu can project that. " <p> Filmed in France and Hungary, " Cyrano de Bergerac " is one of the largest, most lavish and expensive( $ 17 million) films ever mounted in France. The production, which incorporated 40 studio sets and outdoor locations, nearly 2,000 actors and extras, an arsenal of weapons and 100 prosthetic noses for Depardieu( one for each day of shooting), was supervised by Italian opera and stage designer Ezio Frigerio and his wife, Franca Squarciapino. The sumptuous look evokes such 17th century painters as Velasquez and Vermeer. <p> Unlike so many contemporary epics that sacrifice content to visual splendor, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction and script. Loosely adapted from French playwright Edmond Rostand 's late-19th century play, and translated into English subtitles by British novelist Anthony Burgess, the 138-minute film is a celebration of passionate language. <p> For Rappeneau, the achievement is especially sweet. During World War II, he saw " Cyrano de Bergerac " -- his first play -- during a family outing to Paris. " It was the kind of shock one never gets over, " he said. Much later, after a successful 1984 stage revival of the play, Rappeneau was asked to direct the film. When he reread the play, he recalled with diplomatic understatement, " I found that parts of the text had... aged somewhat. " <p> Written in 1897, " Cyrano de Bergerac " was based roughly on the life of Savinien Cyrano de Bergerac( 1619-1655), a soldier, dramatist and writer of science fiction who had a normal nose. Transformed by Rostand, he became one of literature 's great tragic heroes -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloof cousin, Roxane. Too ugly to win her, Cyrano writes love sonnets and supplies them to the doltish Christian, watching from the side as the younger, more handsome man courts her. <p> Oddly enough, Rostand had little faith in " Cyrano de Bergerac " prior to its opening. <p> " On the eve of the premiere he was so sure it would be a flop that he walked up to his actors and said, ' I 'm sorry I dragged you into this stupid venture, ' " Rappeneau said. " Instead, people applauded for two hours. The prime minister was awakened and rushed to the theater to honor him. Within two months, ' Cyrano ' had become a national myth. " In 1900, at 32, Rostand was appointed an Officer of the Legion of Honor, a distinction usually reserved for old men. <p> Credited with resuscitating French literature, Rostand was stunned by the enormity of the reaction, and never recovered. He fled to the Basque region of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays -- " Chantecler " and " L'Aiglon "( The Eaglet), and died at 50. <p> Today, nearly a century later, " Cyrano " enjoys unabated popularity on both sides of the Atlantic : frequent revivals in campus and regional theaters ; required reading for thousand of students ; even a 1987 comic homage, " Roxanne, " that starred Steve Martin and Daryl Hannah in a Pacific Northwest locale. But when Rappeneau returned to his youthful passion, he did n't find the magic he 'd known as a child -- only a musty, unwieldy, five-act " forest of words. " <p> Full of long, florid speeches, and short on action, " Cyrano " seemed to defy translation to the screen. When Rappeneau viewed each of the seven film versions -- including two Italian silents, and a five-minute French film from 1904 -- he decided the problem had never been surmounted. <p> " They were petrified, stilted, and never went beyond the parameters of the play, " Rappeneau said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won an Oscar for Jose Ferrer, the profusion of language overwhelmed the actors, he said, " immobilizing them before the cameras. " <p> In the end, it was a film that never got made that gave Rappeneau courage to mount his own interpretation. In 1948, Orson Welles had planned his own version of " Cyrano, " and in fact spent a year in Paris writing the screenplay. Although it was never made, Rappeneau said, " It reassured me. If someone of Welles ' caliber had entertained such a scheme, and even dreamed of taking on the title role, then it was certainly possible to give the play action and amplitude. " <p> Determined to avoid the chaste, overly theatrical tone of a PBS drama, Rappeneau hired screenwriter Jean-Claude Carriere( " The Tin Drum, " " The Unbearable Lightness of Being ") to fashion a script. Together, they broke down the text -- " just as you would the engine of a car, piece by piece, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and adding new ones for cinematic " links. " <p> " What I tried to do from the beginning, " Rappeneau said, " was to get everybody to be part of the constant movement, to interact all the time and... not just stand around. " By taking liberties with the text, he and Carriere had n't created " a betrayal of Rostand, " he claimed, but rather a " tribute " to him. <p> The writers also gave new life to Roxane and Christian, characters who always had paled next to Cyrano -- for good reason. " Rostand actually wrote the play for Coquelin, a very famous actor of the time, " Rappeneau explained. " He was a very boisterous orator, and when he took center stage, he left all the supporting cast behind. That 's why Roxane and Christian are nothing in the play : He 's an idiot, and she is pretentious and artificial. "( Coquelin also played the role in New York in 1900 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Vincent Perez plays Christian and newcomer Anne Brochet, 24, plays Roxane, a part originally offered to Isabelle Adjani. But it is Depardieu, 41, the veteran of 65 films, an actor with coarse, beefy looks and extraordinary dynamism, who overwhelms the film. <p> On the " Cyrano " set, Rappeneau recalled, most of his cast was stymied by the challenge of reciting the lush alexandrine quartets of the script, and simultaneously executing complicated physical action. " It was an atrocious technical problem for the actors, even for those... who were seasoned to theatrical discipline. ' How do you expect me to run fast and speak slowly? ' one of them asked. " <p> It was Depardieu alone, the director said, who finessed the specific demands of the film from the start. " What an actor! " Rappeneau enthused. " He possesses both grace and ferocity, strength and vulnerability. Who else could have played Cyrano? "
