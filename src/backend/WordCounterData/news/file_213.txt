3041241 <p> The " feud " will certainly continue if the approach to dialogue used by this panel is any guide. I think Ms. Lipstadt provided the most illumination by referring to a " victimhood " in which Jews and blacks had a common bond, though with different circumstances. <p> It would appear that much of the heat of the Jewish/black feud revolves around attaining the political high ground of being perceived as the most victimized - and therefore most worthy of media attention, serious political concessions and designation as the legitimate marksman for the cannon of American guilt. <p> The panel wallowed in victimhood. The Jewish members did not want any train of thought to bypass the horrors of the Holocaust. The black members, painfully and angrily aware of the disintegration of many poor black communities, pointed out that Jews had not solved the problems of the blacks and thus must be part of the problem. New trump cards of victimization were unveiled and the emotional ante was repeatedly raised. <p> I think the American public can only tolerate( due to attention-span deficit) a moderate amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed market for victimhood attention. If anyone is to advance a victimhood agenda, someone else must surrender market share. <p> So the black and Jewish feud will continue. It will be interesting to see the black community 's response should the gay rights effort manage to create a recognized minority status for itself, and new competition for victimhood political status. <p> Promoting racism <p> CHRISTY HOWARD, Dunwoody <p> I am a person whose ancestry is both Jewish and Irish. I took great offense to Lawrence Jeffries accusing my people of deliberate environmental assault on blacks. <p> Drugs and AIDS are not environmental weapons invented by the Irish and Jews for the sole purpose of extinguishing blacks. They affect everybody. Drugs are in all cultures and are a choice individuals have on whether or not to use them. AIDS is a terrifying disease that affects us all. <p> My Irish ancestors came to America during the potato famine and were discriminated against. My Jewish ancestors came to America during Hitler 's reign of power and were discriminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bootstraps to realize their own American dreams. They worked and studied and did not sit back and cry that life is not fair. <p> Lawrence Jeffries needs to realize that by sitting at a table and pointing fingers at other cultures, accusing them of oppressing his people, he is not helping black America. If he would use his position as a respected black member of society to be a role model and mentor to young black America, he could help them far more than by promoting racism against other cultures. <p> Healing the rift <p> Glover Anderson, Lithonia <p> This rift can be easily amended if we come together and continue to focus on what is the real issue - racism and prejudice in this country. We have too many things in common ; blacks and Jews have suffered too many atrocities in this country and abroad. We are going down the wrong road if we do not show an alliance. Our survival is based on each other 's strength. <p> Saving the alliance <p> Leonard Tate, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be saved depends on who makes up the alliance and what their frames of reference are. Blacks and Jews must overcome their European cultural supremacist notions. Blacks must overcome their lack of organized leadership. Otherwise, the issues will always be so convoluted and confusing that the debate will only have spectator event value. <p> Ungrateful comment <p> L. STARKMAN, Atlanta <p> Ozell Sutton 's comment that Jews joined the civil rights movement " for their own self-interest " is an ungrateful one. Lawrence Jeffries espouses and embraces the venomous hatred, bigotry and anti-Semitism of Farrakhan and Khalid Muhammad. The article states that Jews have had an advantage because of their white skin color, but we have Jews of color, too. <p> Scapegoating Jews for society 's ills has been a convenient tool throughout the ages. It prevents one from taking responsibility for one 's own actions, and allows one to deny or ignore the real problems at hand. Issues of black on black violence, guns, crime, drugs, teenage pregnancies and reestablishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Our world would be a better place if there would be respect for all people, races and religions. <p> Both have been victims <p> Zan Haleem, Duluth <p> While I believe that all of humanity needs to form an alliance, it is especially important that African-Americans and Jewish Americans refrain from forming a rift between each other. <p> Both have been victims of ignorance, bigotry and savagery. Both suffered unimaginably from people who proclaimed themselves to be superior and more intelligent. In reality, this was just a mask for their backwardness and close-mindedness. <p> You tell me - how sophisticated is a civilization/culture that would enslave human beings and subject them to centuries of brutality and torture? Or, gather an innocent group of people, and based on these people 's religion, lock them behind walls of wire, starve them and torture them, and eventually suffocate them in gas ovens? Does n't look like a sign of higher intelligence, does it? <p> We all need to come together and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Do n't need scapegoat <p> FRED MARCUS, Atlanta <p> Some clarifying points on one aspect of black/Jewish relations, specifically the Nation of Islam. First, the Nation of Islam represents a radical minority, attractive to the media, not to the majority of black Americans. Second, the Nation of Islam is thoroughly anti-Semitic, which media sound bites do not convey. Third, it has adopted the methods of political and physical intimidation employed by the early Nazis - it is no mistake that the media describes the Nation of Islam in terms it once used for the Nazis, as a movement which restores pride and economic self- reliance at the expense of the Jews. <p> Farrakhan and company have styled themselves after the Nazis because it works. Let us pray that black Americans continue to realize that true pride and self-reliance do not need a scapegoat and that moral cowardice, which does not become a free people, can only lead to tragedy. <p> What Farrakhan says <p> Saul Alter, Atlanta <p> I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. It 's amazing to me some of the things that Farrakhan says. I respect what he 's trying to do as far as getting black people to stand up and fight against drugs and be men and take care of their children. But as far as these anti-Semitic remarks, it 's just crazy. Black people have been discriminated against. Why would they turn around and discriminate, too? <p> Who 's the enemy? <p> Janet Rice, Atlanta <p> Lawrence Jeffries is committing the fallacy of thinking that the end justifies the means. I find it illogical that he would think that stepping on people would ultimately help his people. It would be a moral canker that would ultimately bring down the very cause that he wishes to support. He 's becoming the enemy. <p> Come to a compromise <p> Jerry Washington, Atlanta <p> I believe the alliance can be saved if the two peoples recognize the great differences in their cultural roots and then come to some compromise. The fact that we do n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagree on some things. We ought to come to terms with it. <p> Comments disturbing <p> Stuart Lewengrub, Regional Director, Anti-Defamation League, Atlanta <p> The comments offered by several panelists are deeply disturbing. Continuous repetition of false, anti-Semitic canards does not endow them with truth nor does it lead to better understanding. <p> For example, black student Lawrence Jeffries repeats the line that " Jews can not select black leaders, " thus suggesting that we have the will or desire to do so, which we emphatically do not. Blacks choose their own leaders. <p> What we Jews have every right to do is to determine for ourselves those with whom we will work, meet, cooperate, and whose programs and goals we will support. Jews also have every right to reject and criticize those black( or white) " leaders " who engage in racism and anti-Semitism. <p> Ozell Sutton singles out Jewish-owned stores and institutions among those that were targets of sit-ins, thus implying that Jews were among the leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews who supported the civil rights struggle did so for reasons of self- interest and self-protection. <p> That is both untrue and insulting. In fact, the Jewish community, which overwhelmingly supported desegregation, put itself at risk in expressing that support. <p> The first hotel in Atlanta to desegregate its facilities( before the law required it) was owned by a Jewish family. Many of the stores and businesses that first provided southern Blacks with opportunities for white collar, sales and supervisory employment were owned by Jews. Very few Jews supported segregation. The Jewish community 's support of an integrated society 30 years ago and since has been based on principle, not fear that we " would be next. " <p> What the black commentators on the panel seem not to recognize is that in excusing, condoning, tolerating and failing to criticize the virulent racism and anti-Semitism expressed by " leaders " such as Farrakhan and Muhammad, they lend support to the kind of bigotry to which they have historically fallen victim and they undermine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day grievances. <p> People as individuals <p> MICHAEL HALPERN, Atlanta <p> I am a middle-class, white, non-religious Jew born and raised in New York. I moved here in 1962. In 1983, I started doing volunteer work in the surgical emergency clinic of Grady Hospital. <p> During my five years of " hand holding " patients of all races, backgrounds and persuasions in time of dire need, I learned to look at people as individuals, not as stereotypical representations of whatever group they appeared to belong to. <p> I also became keenly aware of the hopelessness that so many of our young people feel about their future - a hopelessness that frequently leads to dropping out of school, drugs, crime and, all too often, violent death. In 1988, I became one of the founding members of an organization formed to make a difference. This group, now called YES! Atlanta( for Youth Experiencing Success), proposed to work, long-term, with inner-city kids to fundamentally alter the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support them for an extended period in achieving life goals that they set for themselves. <p> In 1989, I became, first, a major financial contributor, then YES! Atlanta 's volunteer executive director, a post I held for 2 1/2 years while simultaneously running my own business. During my tenure we created the Rising Star program, which has, to date, worked with close to 150 inner-city teens and has been acknowledged at a national level for making a difference in young lives. <p> Since stepping down from day-to-day management - the organization having grown to the point where we needed full-time professional staff - I have remained active with YES! Atlanta at the board level. I deeply believe in the value of the work we do with these teenagers, 97 percent of whom happen to be black. <p> While we may still think of people in groups, we must, in this steadily shrinking world, deal with people as individuals.
