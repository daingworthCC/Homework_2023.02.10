Cash only. -- <p> EL HUARACHE AZTECA <p> One of the best things you can do on a Saturday or Sunday is get a few friends together, install yourselves under El Huarache Azteca 's murals and spend some quality time with the platillo de barbacoa -- smoky, roasted lamb, by the plate or the pound -- and the cold beverage of your choice. Otherwise, corn is the thing here, in a dozen shapes with many fillings : Mmsa patted into thick sopes and grilled ; tortillas wrapped around chicken stewed with tomato and onion ; fried cornmeal pouches with pressed, deep-fried pork rind ; and the signature huaraches, extra-thick tortillas topped with meat, cactus or huitlacoche. <p> Cuisine : Mexican <p> Vitals : 3842 International Blvd.( between 38th and 39th avenues), Oakland.( 510) 533-2395.

The flavors are as clean as the simple interior. Share crisp, cigar-thin spring rolls with carrots, taro and silver noodles, progress to tom kha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spices, an assertively dressed prawn salad or laap, a Laotian salad with meat or tofu.

Entrees like souvlaki or lamb chops come with salad and lemony rice pilaf or french fries. Stick with the rice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are the stars here.
