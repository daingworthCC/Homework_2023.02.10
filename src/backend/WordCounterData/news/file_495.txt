4090641 Marc Ribot was about 10 when he saw Charlie Chaplin 's classic 1921 silent film " The Kid " on TV. To a kid growing up in the New Jersey burbs in the 1960s, the movie - a comic and wrenching tale about the Little Tramp and the abandoned baby he finds, raises and fights to keep - seemed absolutely ancient. Chaplin 's antics aside, he thought the movie was inherently funny because it was so old. # " I could n't fathom the lives of the people who made the movie or were in it. It was another world, " says Ribot, the protean guitarist and composer whose latest CD, " Silent Movies, " includes some of the spare, wistful themes from his solo-guitar score to " The Kid. " Revisiting the movie after the New York Guitar Festival commissioned the work last year, Ribot saw the story in a startling new light. # " It feels contemporary to me now, " says Ribot, who will play the score, much of which he improvises, when " The Kid " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The performance promises to be one of the highlights of SFJazz 's Spring Season, which opens Friday night with a concert by the South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela at the Palace of Fine Arts and runs through June. # " I see it as a really moving film about a single father trying to create a family in a really hard economic situation, " says Ribot, 56, a vital force on New York 's multifarious downtown music scene since the 1980s. He 's on the phone from the Brooklyn apartment he shares with his 13-year-old daughter, Clara, when she 's not living nearby with her mother. " I wrote it after the stock market crash, and all that was very much in the news. I did n't want to play it for laughs. I wanted to play it for its emotional resonance. It 's emotionally difficult for me to watch. " # A passionate and inquisitive artist, Ribot is renowned for playing and often merging many kinds of music in his own idiosyncratic way : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuban music. His current bands include the improvising rock trio Ceramic Dog - " we 're aiming for a certain kind of sensory overload in the room, " he says - and Spiritual Unity, which re-creates and reimagines the raw, rapturous music of the late avant-garde jazz saxophonist Albert Ayler. # Ribot 's visceral playing has enriched the music of artists as different as Tom Waits, Elvis Costello, John Zorn and Marianne Faithfull he was also featured on Alison Krauss and Robert Plant 's multi-Grammy-winning " Raising Sand ". He 's written a number of film scores over the years, and performed on dozens of others, including " Walk the Line, " " The Departed " and, most recently, " The Kids Are All Right. " # " You do n't notice a great film score, " says Ribot, a provocative and amusing guy. " Film scoring is one those jobs like proofreading : When you do it perfectly, it disappears. It 's only if the movie sucks or the score sucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pieces on " Silent Movies, " some of which he wrote for film scores and others for movies he only imagined, sonic analogs to silent film. He 's interested in " that strange area that 's a common property of sound and image. Watching a train crash in a silent film, you can believe you 're actually hearing it. You hear what you 're seeing. And there 's a musical idea of space. You can see what you 're hearing. A certain kind of reverb creates a feeling of spatial distance. A certain sonic gesture can be described as jagged or empty. " # Ribot began creating his score to " The Kid " by simply playing along with the film, which he watched about 150 times. Themes began to emerge, which he more or less codified and improvises on. He 's performed the piece four times, responding differently to the film each night based on the mood and " what I ate, " he says with a laugh. # " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " adds Ribot, who early on backed Wilson Pickett, Chuck Berry and the soul-jazz organist Brother Jack McDuff. " I thought, ' Why not learn to improvise in the language of film music? I wanted to improvise the things that film composers do. " # Ribot admires the Tchaikovsky-inspired score that Chaplin later composed for " The Kid " but did n't reference it. He created leitmotifs for characters and relationships. One theme, based on a mixolydian mode, evokes Chaplin 's tender feelings for the kid Jackie Coogan and the absence of the boy 's mother. A syncopated theme of daily life, sunny and sad, has a Nino Rota feel to it. # " Anarchy is always a character in Charlie Chaplin 's, chaos is a character, " says Ribot, who unleashes various free improvisations to accompany " the fight scenes and craziness. There are some 1920s tropes in there, but I did n't want it to be about sounding old. It 's solo guitar music, which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a feeling in the film. Chaplin and the kid are alone in a hostile world. They 're hanging on by a thread. # " There are a lot funny parts. But there 's a certain sadness underlying the film. The set is a building-by-building re-creation of the street that Chaplin grew up on in East London he was taken away from his mother at age 7. It 's beginning to dawn on people that people lived like that, in that poverty, and that people do live like that. And the people who do live like that might be us. I want to place this in the present. " # Playing a nearly 60-minute, mostly improvised score while the movie screens overheard is particularly challenging for a lone guitarist. # " The solo guitar is limited, " Ribot says. " It 's not an orchestra. If you get into saying, ' Oh, I wish I were an orchestra, you 're going to be overplaying like crazy. You ca n't start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other 33 people did n't show up. You have to start from the supposition that you 're lucky to have six strings instead of one. It takes a certain discipline to only play one string for a while, so when you bring in the other five, it creates the effect of fullness.
