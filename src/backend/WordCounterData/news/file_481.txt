4086141 Hutchison 's awakening # Old vs. new # Regarding " Time to get financial house in order "( Page B11, Tuesday), it is quite easy to distinguish the old guard Republicans from the new tea party variety. # Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison touts her support of Houston Metro and DART as necessary accomplishments, while New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie-type budget cutters have managed to kill the behemoth Jersey-to-New York tunnel project, and Sen. John Boehner, R-Ohio, promises to block federal funding for the multibillion-dollar California rapid transit bullet train experiment. # Politicians routinely use the love of sports among urban voters to build stadiums without regard to who pays the bills( " Cash-short agency dips into reserve, " Page B1, Nov. 12). # The old school always finds money for shiny public works. # Let 's hope the new understand that they can only stay in power if the public works. # - Glen Risley, # Houston # Questions # Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison has found her way. She has finally realized the national debt is a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peers, seemed to have had this realization the day President Obama took the oath of office and not a day before. # Where was Sen. Hutchison when former President George W. Bush pushed through two huge tax cuts that only deepened the hole of national debt? # Was she being fiscally responsible to have a hand in converting four years of budget surpluses into an endless string of deficits? # Did she vote to send our troops to Iraq to seek out those invisible weapons of mass destruction? # Did she vote for a tax increase or to cut spending in some other area to pay for that war? # Did she vote in favor of Medicare Plan D despite the fact that this expensive program was unfunded? # I would love to read her answers to these questions. # - William J. MarzenII, # Katy # Realization # I agree with Sen. Hutchison that as a nation we can not continue to spend more money than we are willing to pay. # My concern is that, as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national deficit to explode from $5.8 trillion when President George W. Bush took office to $10.6 trillion when he left office. Since our foreign wars cost about $1 trillion, I wonder where did all the other borrowed trillions go? They sure did n't help the economy. # Hutchison claims that Republicans are ready to get tough on spending. But instead of spelling out a plan, she complains about executive branch earmarks. # From 2003 to 2007, two GOP-controlled Congresses eagerly handed off many legislative duties to the executive branch, saying that they had to support a wartime president. # I 'm glad that the senator now realizes this was a mistake, but the damage is done. # - David J. Maschek, # Houston #... # Simply appalling # Regarding " Kyl 's START treaty stunt is a new low "( Page B8, Nov. 19), the only time in my life I ever saw my parents afraid was during the Cuban missile crisis, when they were telling me, a second-grader, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light in the sky. # I had regular nightmares of nuclear annihilation for many years afterward, as I suspect did many of my generation. As a physicist I know that a single warhead set off over downtown Houston would set houses in Katy on fire. I find the idea that some Republicans may use the START II treaty as an opportunity to score political points beyond appalling. # Nuclear war is the single most serious thing we can deal with, by far and beyond a doubt. START is not perfect, no treaty ever is, but it moves us a little further from nuclear war, and that is a really good thing. # - Alan Jackson, # Houston # Motion to lay on the table # Regarding " Time to take teaching to a new level "( Page B9, Monday), Thomas Friedman cites The Global Achievement Gap and the three basic skills that students need if they want to thrive in a knowledge economy : the ability to do critical thinking and problem-solving ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. # We, members of a Houston chapter of The National Association of Parliamentarians, have the tool with which one can learn these skills : Robert 's Rules of Order. # At our meeting this month we endorsed the instruction of Robert 's Rules in all public and private schools from kindergarten to grade 12. # Our goal is for students to master all aspects of Robert 's from the development of bylaws to the election of student governments with the creation of mentors through an Ambassador/Student Council relationship. # For the past 31 years one of our members has been teaching this subject, mostly to adults. In 1985, he began teaching Robert 's in the schools. The first school was River Oaks Elementary( HISD). Since that time he 's taught this curriculum to children as young as second graders and as old as 12th. # Some suggest that there is no silver bullet to fix education in the United States. We think there is, and this is it. # - Ted Weisgal, # Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ censure for New York 's Rangel "( Page A13, Nov. 19), U.S. Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-New York, got up before Congress and pleaded his case that he did not get any enrichment from his actions. # Just what is his interpretation of the word enrichment? He certainly enriched himself by not having to pay income taxes all those 17 years on the rental income from that property he owned. His problem is only compounded by the fact that he was chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee that is responsible for writing those income tax laws. # Anybody else would have been fined, made to pay penalties and all back taxes plus possibly going to jail, but not Rangel. He considers his 20 terms in office as qualifications for not having to follow the laws that he has a hand in imposing. # And he certainly enriched himself with those four rent-controlled units in Harlem. He did n't have to pay the full value for those units ; he did n't even use them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own constituents the opportunity to have affordable housing in Harlem. # If House Speaker Nancy Pelosi really wanted to - as she has said - clean out the swamp, Charlie Rangel should have gotten expulsion and not censure. It is those kinds of actions by Rangel that put
