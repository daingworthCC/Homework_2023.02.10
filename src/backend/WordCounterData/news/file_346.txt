3058741 <p> Carla Trapp used to lie awake at night wishing she were thin. <p> " I tried for years to get rid of these, " she says, patting the flesh on each thigh. " I know they 're absolutely gross. " <p> But none of the diet or exercise programs she tried had any impact on her thighs or the 40 pounds she wants to lose. <p> Trapp could n't change the way she looks, but she has changed her perspective. Rather than focusing on weight loss, she now tries to stick to a healthy diet, stay physically fit and avoid gaining more weight. <p> As for her thighs, she has given up. " I just try not to think about them. " <p> Millions of Americans identify with Trapp. They, too, are fighting a long-term battle with their bodies. Now, as the oldest boomers approach 50, any hope they might have had for a slender body is sagging into oblivion. Surveys show that Americans want to maintain a reasonable weight and get increasingly upset as their weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ svelte young bodies out of most people 's reach. <p> But there are signs attitudes are changing as more Americans accept the bodies they have. In the 1990s advertising will appeal to consumers by emphasizing self-acceptance and downplaying guilt. Expanding waistlines <p> Despite all the talk about health and fitness, most Americans are fat and getting fatter. <p> In 1983, 58 percent of adults weighed more than the amounts recommended by standard authorities. That is now 63 percent, according to the 1992 Prevention Index published by Prevention magazine. <p> The problem for most overweight people is not obesity but chubbiness. Obesity is generally defined as being 20 percent or more above the proper weight. <p> One widely used definition of " proper weight " is a chart produced by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. <p> According to its measure, a 5-foot-10-inch man with a medium frame should weigh between 151 pounds and 163 pounds. A medium-frame woman who is 5-feet-4-inches tall should be between 124 pounds and 138 pounds. <p> About 15 percent of Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey based on the Met Life chart. This proportion has remained unchanged since 1983. <p> About 18 percent of Americans are between 10 percent and 20 percent above the recommended weight, up from 15 percent in 1983. And 30 percent are less than 10 percent over the recommended weight. <p> Why are so many Americans getting heavy? Experts do n't know for sure. <p> Some point to a national diet that is high in fat. Others blame hereditary factors or a decline in physically demanding jobs. The culprit may be dieting : Many people who diet eventually gain back more weight than they lost. <p> But whatever the cause, chubbiness becomes more common with advancing age, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. <p> Age and weight gain may go together because people are less concerned with their appearance as they age. <p> Middle-age boomers are presumably less concerned about dating, mating and achieving a perfect body. They have competing concerns, such as juggling family and career. Moreover, their bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition to extra weight, they have to cope with sagging, wrinkles, graying or disappearing hair and assorted health problems including bad knees, menopause and high blood pressure. In this context, losing weight loses importance. <p> For married working mothers such as Trapp, the primary obstacle to weight reduction is lack of time and energy. <p> " Losing weight takes concentration and determination. I would have to quit my job or go on an extended vacation to really focus on my diet. " <p> And even if she had the time and discipline to diet, Trapp 's family does n't want to eat low-calorie food. She prepares meals her children will eat, many of which are high in fat and calories. <p> Figures from both the NCHS and Prevention show a nation getting fatter. <p> Even young adults( age 25 to 34) are heavier today than in the past. Young women have been getting heavier for several decades, according to a 1988 University of Michigan study. <p> Adults are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years. In 1984, 24 percent of children weighed more than is recommended for their age and sex. In 1991, 34 percent of children were heavier than they should be, according to the Prevention Index. <p> Just 19 percent of Americans are within their recommended weight range and only 18 percent are underweight, according to the Prevention Index. <p> If so few of us are actually thin, why is thinness considered " normal? " <p> Television producers and fashion designers deserve part of the blame for holding a fat nation to body-beautiful standards. Thin models <p> Most television and film actors, particularly leading men and women, are thin. Memorable larger characters, such as Archie Bunker or Roseanne Arnold, are usually presented as ridiculous or comical. <p> The average female fashion model is 5-feet-9 1/2-inches tall and weighs 123 pounds, according to a study by Brandeis University psychologists. <p> But the average American woman is 5-feet-4-inches tall and weighs 144 pounds, according to the NCHS. <p> Societal standards of body size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscle tone in addition to thinness. <p> " We 've seen a shift in the ideal woman 's body in just the last five years, " says Dr. Joseph McVoy, director of the Eating Disorders Program at St. Albans Hospital in Radford, Va. <p> " Before, it was enough to have a thin body. Now women are also putting an emphasis on larger breasts and muscular arms for a Madonna-like look. " <p> If Marilyn Monroe were taking a screen test today, she would probably be told to diet and go to a gym, McVoy says. <p> According to a 1990 survey by Self magazine, 64 percent of women are very satisfied with their height, 53 percent are very satisfied with their hairstyle or hair color, but only 24 percent are very satisfied with their weight. In 1992, 46 percent of Americans said they feel overweight, according to a survey by Bruskin/Goldring Research in Edison, N.J. <p> In the 1990s, the number of people age 35 and older will increase by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose weight, their only other choice is to develop a more realistic standard of acceptable body size. Surrender to the bulge <p> West of Madison Avenue, people are learning to accept their bodies. <p> Almost two-thirds( 63 percent) of Americans say there is too much emphasis on being thin in our society, according to a 1990 Gallup poll. <p> More than half( 57 percent) say they are eating pretty much what they want to, up from 49 percent in 1977, according to a 1991 Roper survey. <p> Dieting seems to be on the wane. Between 1986 and 1991 the number of dieters dropped from 65 million to 48 the Calorie Control Council reported. <p> The market for commercial, hospital- and physician-based weight-loss programs declined considerably in 1990, according to a study by Marketdata Enterprises of Valley Stream, N.Y. <p> Weight anxiety has long been a tool for marketers of diet aids, diet foods and health-and-beauty aids. Ads for these products often portray an imperfect body as the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The new message is ' use this product to improve what you have, ' not ' let this product fix your problems, ' " says Judith Langer of Langer Associates, a New York City research firm. " Women are saying, ' I am trying to be the best me I can be - not a model. ' It 's a strategy based on self-like, not anxiety. " <p> Advertisements for women 's Nike shoes are taking this approach. One tells the reader, " Someday, since you are human, you will notice your body has changed... and your kneecaps look more like Winston Churchill than ever before. " <p> Other companies are moving away from young, lean bodies in products and advertising. Lee and Levi 's have introduced looser-fitting blue jeans for the aging boomer body. <p> Print ads for Lee jeans read, " Forget about cholesterol. It 's your jeans that have been cutting off your circulation. " <p> These positive images are not yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a perfect to a healthy body, more businesses will change their message from anti-fat to pro-health. 1993 American Demographics
