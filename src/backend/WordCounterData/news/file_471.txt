Sixteen teams from nine countries work to shape a 12-foot-tall, 20-ton block of snow into an eye-catching scultpure. They have five days, then it 's up to the judges.

Sculpting continues until 10 a.m. Saturday, but visitors can vote on the pieces starting today. Take a tour through downtown Breck and choose your favorites for the People 's Choice and Kids Choice awards.

Electro. It 's a thin line between mainstream electronic music and the subgenre that has been dubbed " indie electro. " But many of the buzz acts that have come out of the South by Southwest and Coachella music festivals over the last couple of years -Girl Talk and Flosstradamus included - tend to skew toward the indie electro end of the spectrum. The music features beats that are big and sometimes familiar, and( for those that follow these things) it sounds like a natural extension of the electroclash days. The Noise series at Beta( 1909 Blake St.) has already brought in some big indie electro names, but tonight 's guest - Hot Pink Delorean - is a DJ/ production troupe on the rise, as evidenced by its many dates already scheduled at the upcoming South by Southwest and Winter Music Conference festivals in March.
