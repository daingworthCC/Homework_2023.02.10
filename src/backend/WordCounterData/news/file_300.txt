3051641 <p> A threat to public education <p> Editor -- It does n't surprise me that Cupertino Union School District has been placed " at risk " for failing to follow the( unreasonable testing) confines of " No Child Left Behind "( editorial, Feb. 18). Cupertino has always offered an exceptional education to handicapped students, particularly autistic persons. <p> Many of these students are severely handicapped and are unable to write or even communicate verbally. To ask them to take a comprehensive, multiple-choice( federal and state-mandated) exam is lunacy. I taught in Cupertino for years. One of my severely autistic students actually attempted to eat the answer sheet -- yet he was included in the federal and state database. <p> If the mandates of " No Child Left Behind " continue without reasonable modification, they are likely to drastically alter the landscape of public education, if not destroy it entirely. <p> JIM THURBER <p> Mountain View <p> -- -- -- <p> Editor -- You left out the reason why as many as 310 California school districts could be added to the watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the state complies with the 95 percent participation rate required by the feds. Parents are pressured by the schools to " opt out, " thereby artificially elevating the test scores and " leaving behind " the very children that need the most help. <p> The California public-school system should rise to the challenge of educating all children in the same spirit that Mayor Gavin Newsom is addressing the homeless problem in San Francisco. Instead of making excuses, strong leadership can make a difference. <p> ALAN J. SMITH <p> San Francisco <p> Leave fiction to writers <p> Editor -- Naomi Oreskes faults fiction-writer Michael Crichton( " ' Fear ' -mongering ' Crichton wrong on science, " Open Forum, Feb. 16) on his presentation of science, history and politics -- being an associate professor of history, and director of Science Studies at UC San Diego, she should know. <p> She suggests that Crichton, specifically, and by implication, the rest of us, leave discussions of science to the scientists, history to the historians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of global warming. That 's where she 's wrong, because scientists are often wrong. They lie, or have their honest data misused. <p> While there may be no harm in attempting to modify our human behaviors related to the use of fossil fuels, it 's pretty ridiculous for scientists to discuss these questions without dealing with the socioeconomic realities of growing nations, which will either make or break any plans for global change that we might control. <p> ANTHONY VERREOS <p> San Francisco <p> -- -- -- <p> Editor -- Michael Crichton 's claim that because scientists who had a consensus concerning eugenics were wrong then scientists now must be wrong about climate change is absurd. Let him come up with a cloned Tyrannosaurus rex, and then I 'll pay attention to his views. <p> ROBERT PRENTISS <p> San Francisco <p> Who is to blame? <p> Editor -- Re " Wildlife scientists feeling heat, "( Feb. 10). <p> The brass at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have been in cahoots with the developers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. It is a classic example of an agency co-opted by the industry it is supposed to be overseeing. So it is no wonder that the bureaucrats are rolling their scientists and eviscerating the Endangered Species Act from the inside. <p> But it is shocking that they would publicly hold hands with developers and boldly claim that the law needs to be re-written. <p> We need the Endangered Species Act 's system of checks and balances to hold politicians accountable for extinctions, and I hope the voting public will do so, even if the politicians lose sight of this fundamental principle. <p> BRENT PLATER <p> San Francisco <p> No cats adopted for mouse control <p> Editor -- Re " SPCA finds new menace to cats -- mice, "( Open Forum, Feb. 17) and her concerns about the adoption process at the San Francisco SPCA. <p> During 137 years of lifesaving animal welfare work in this community, the San Francisco SPCA has developed adoption guidelines that attempt to provide a measure of protection for the dogs and cats for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " companion animals. " Consequently, the San Francisco SPCA is very reluctant to adopt a cat to an individual whose purpose is to use it as a mouser. <p> Rodent infestation is not a matter that can be solved by recourse to a cat. It is a health problem, and landlords who refuse to deal with it should be reported to the health department. In addition, the use of rat poison is a real danger to pets because of the risk of ingestion of the poison, either as pellets or in rodent corpses. <p> The writer, Mara Math, was counseled that when the mice infestation in her apartment had been curtailed, the San Francisco SPCA would be happy for her to adopt a kitten. We stand by that offer. <p> KISKA ICARD, director of adoption <p> San Francisco SPCA <p> -- -- -- <p> Editor -- Amen to Mara Math 's report on her experiences with the San Francisco SPCA. I wonder why the organization is so concerned with collecting invasive private information on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convicted animal abusers from adopting). Its paternalistic attitude must result in far fewer placements of animals into loving homes. <p> It 's much simpler and comes with a lot more respect to spend a few dollars more and buy a cat or dog from a pet shop or breeder and not have to put up with the San Francisco SPCA 's self-defeating keeper mentality. <p> THERESA HARNED <p> San Francisco <p> Pound problem <p> Editor -- Thanks for a good piece on the troubles at the Oakland Animal Shelter( Bay Area, Feb. 17). Hopefully the public meeting and the ongoing investigation will bring about overdue change. <p> There are some figures quoted in the article which may mislead readers : Photograph caption of the pit bull/lab mix Cody reads that he is one of " 17 adoptable dogs " in the shelter. The real figures lie in what are known as the " back wards. " These kennels, row upon row, contain the 100 dogs that are not seen up front in the pretty adoption mall. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oakland 's problem exists. <p> According to the shelter 's own figures they took in 2,455 live dogs last year. After just 14 percent of those were returned to the owners, leaving 2,106, the shelter euthanized 1,338. That is 64 percent. It does n't matter whether an animal can be tested and graded and defined as " unadaptable. " They are all living creatures whose killing should concern us all. <p> Animal shelters are every city 's dirty little secret, and law enforcement ought to get out of the business. Cities should examine ways of contracting this service to nonprofit agencies with statewide standardized procedures and policies. <p> JILL POSENER <p> Berkeley <p> Streets of Nairobi <p> Editor -- A conference was held in San Francisco this week involving professionals in the minerals and metals industries. I am involved and have spoken to many business friends and associates who live and/or work in countries all over the world. Here 's there take on San Francisco : The homeless problem was on everyone 's lips. Comments like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also were shocked at the condition of the city streets. Personally, I think the streets of Nairobi are in better condition. <p> MIKE ROLLAND <p> San Francisco
