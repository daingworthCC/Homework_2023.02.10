3073341 <p> Editor -- I 'm confused and I wish someone would explain this to me. <p> We as a society hold life in such high esteem that we spend millions developing drugs and machines that will keep hearts beating and lungs transferring oxygen beyond all hope of recovery, and in the name of " life " allow human suffering that we would not tolerate in our pets. Yet we ca n't wait to start up the old gas chamber. <p> We as a society are moving closer to a time when the life of an unborn child is paramount to the health and welfare of its mother. Yet the number of children born into poverty, drug addiction and abuse rises daily. The nutrition-supplementing WIC program that has proved to save the lives and health of pregnant women, infants and toddlers is being cut back. ##How can anyone be surprised at our rate of crime, violence and obvious signs of hopelessness in our society under these circumstances? <p> RACHEL HEYMAN GAIA <p> San Francisco <p> CANADA CRISIS <p> Editor -- So far in the U.S., the crisis in Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condescending to remain part of Canada have been represented as a rather comic opera. <p> No indications have been given as to whether this imminent collapse of constitutional government in our best neighbor and largest trading partner will have any effect on us. <p> What I have not mentioned is the fact that Quebec sits astride the St. Lawrence Seaway, the outlet for most of Canada 's commerce with Europe and Africa and between the Maritimes and Canada. Thus Quebec is in a position to cut off this traffic at any time or impose ruinous tariffs -- which, given the nature of the Quebecois mind, they will be unable to resist doing, even if they agree not to. <p> They will also be in a position to create considerable conflict with respect to a 200 mile sea rights limit on the basis of some tiny islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. In this they will be supported by France, which has retained overlordship of two microscopic islands off the south coast of Newfoundland. <p> It is unthinkable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a position. It will be worthwhile to monitor troop movements in eastern Canada in the near future. If hostilities break out, the U.S. can hardly avoid being drawn into it one way or another. <p> ALAN C. NIXON <p> Berkeley <p> OWLS VS. JOBS <p> Editor -- As a registered nurse I spend my spare time in the forests, which I love, with its animals and spotted northern owls. <p> But stopping 25 percent of Northern California timber cutting is outrageous! <p> The livelihood of many California families depends on the lumber industry. Do we let their children go without shelter, without clothing or food, so the spotted owl will have a warm nest? <p> I think the environmentalists, who want to save the forest for the spotted owl, need to move out of their houses ; since they are built from trees. Maybe they could live in an adobe hut. Or does adobe have a worm living in it that is on the endangered species list? Well, in that case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The solution : We as humans have to adapt every day to new ways of living -- to poisons, to stress and all other kinds of pollutants and adversity! <p> Do you think it would be polite to ask the spotted owl to move over a bit and to adapt to changes, like we have to do? <p> MICHELLE CARTER <p> Redding <p> DOLLAR COINS <p> Editor -- Your recent editorial recommending the replacement of the dollar bill with a coin is well taken and its implementation long overdue. <p> The Susan B. Anthony dollar was a fiasco. Not the subject, which was well-chosen, but the shape and size of the coin. As you noted, the SBA too closely resembled a quarter, a fact which should have been apparent to Congress, the Treasury, the Mint, the executive department and all the others who had a finger in the pie. <p> Many countries have already replaced their " ones " with a coin. In the U.K., for example, the coin which replaced their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but twice as thick, readily distinguishable by feel whether sighted or unsighted. An alternative, with the same advantage, would be a multi-sided coin. And, while they 're at it, consideration might be given to down-sizing the 50 cent coin( where have they all gone?) and replacing it with a multi-sided version. <p> HARRY WINTHER <p> Cupertino <p> COSTLY PROPOSITION <p> Editor -- I simply can not bring myself to believe that all of the California electorate who voted for the passage of Proposition 117, the Wildlife Protection Statute, really understood how much it is going to cost the taxpayers of California to save those 2,000 mountain lions. <p> I do believe that this proposition would not have been approved if all who voted for it realized that it will cost $ 30 million a year for 30 years. That 's $ 900,000,000 that is ordained to be spent over that period regardless of future economic conditions, or even whether such expenditures will really be necessary so many years in the future. <p> Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voters for Proposition 117 remember that more than $ 1 billion has been spent over the last 10 years for land acquisition, a portion of which was for wildlife habitat. <p> It seems as though almost anything can be put on the ballot by the initiative process these days, especially if the petition has an appeal like " save the California mountain lions, " as did Proposition 117. <p> F. V. PHILPOT <p> Millbrae <p> PRO CRUSTACEANS <p> Editor -- The fragile bridge between land and sea that houses all those " sub-intelligent, semi-inert crustaceans "( Letters, June 5), is an important and vital part of our ecosystem. <p> I 'm surprised that an " environmentalist " would write such a thoughtless letter. <p> ELAINE EISENBERG <p> San Mateo <p> TRAGIC REMINDERS <p> Editor -- Maybe stoic letter writer Mark Hooker should spend some time here in Aptos where he could be bombarded by the constant visual reminders of the earthquake in the horribly-damaged and still unrepaired buildings, the yawning emptiness where once there were structures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gnawing frustration of living in a damaged home that the contractor wo n't have time to fix for still another three months. <p> After first-hand exposure to the reality of daily coping with the effects of the quake, he might acquire some compassion for us " pathetic people " who 'd like nothing more than to be able to get on with our lives but have some difficulty doing so when we 're reminded at every minute of the havoc of last October. <p> Walk, Mr. Hooker, in our moccasins. <p> SUZANNE KRAKOVER-NICKEL <p> Aptos <p> DEALING WITH TERRORS <p> Editor -- I 'm writing in response to Mark Hooker 's comment on post-earthquake stress : " Why do n't these pathetic people... shut up and get on with their lives... <p> In 1982, I lost my husband and my home in a mudslide, and was lucky to escape alive. <p> It was nine months before I could go back to work. It was 11 months before I could move out of disaster aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting before I got a homeowner 's insurance settlement. <p> Anyone who knows me will tell you I am a strong, calm person, not a hysteric, but I spent three years in therapy. It was four years before I could hear rain without my stomach knotting in fear, and sleep through the night without waking up screaming from nightmares. <p> Even seven and a half years later, the disaster feeling of the quake brought it all painfully back. <p> Through it all, one of the worst parts was dealing with insensitive clods like Hooker who told me to get on with my life. I was trying to do just that, as hard as I could. <p> We all have terrors we can not bear. Mark Hooker should pray that he never discovers his. <p> SHARI PRANGE <p> Felton <p> TO BE CONTINUED <p> Editor -- Thanks for all your recent attention. I will be spending the summer with Elvis, touring the country in his Winnebago. <p> See you in the fall. @ @ @ @ @ @
