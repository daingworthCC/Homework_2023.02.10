3040541 <p> This guide to what you 'll see on television tonight was prepared by staff writer Raad Cawthon, based on NBC 'S advance plans for coverage on Channel 11. In Barcelona today, as action unfolded, staff writer Prentis Rogers was at NBC 's headquarters ; he has added comment based on what he learned there. <p> EVENING HIGHLIGHTS Basketball <p> NBC Sports president Dick Ebersol has promised to show more of the Dream Team this week as it gets closer to winning the gold medal. " One of the things I 've noticed is that they 've put those VIP and media seats behind the benches and because they 're arriving late, people watching on television think nobody is there, " Ebersol said. " We 've had to pan the crowd so viewers can see they 're going crazy over here about the Dream Team. " The U.S. team has had no trouble reaching tonight 's quarterfinals against Puerto Rico and has given no indication of letting up. <p> Diving <p> The men 's platform final wraps up this sport for the 1992 Games. " Just think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " dreams are made and shattered in 1.2 seconds. " The announcer expressed concern going into the event that the judges were predisposed to looking favorably upon the Chinese. " I 'm not going to say they 're biased, but diving is a very subjective sport, " Mitchell said. " As a diver, though, there 's nothing you alter because you do n't pay attention to what anyone else is doing. So divers do n't feel a sense of bias as the frustrated coaches do because they know the mental images from the preliminaries are carried over into the finals in the minds of the judges. " However, American Mark Lenzi was able to break through last week and countrymen Matt Scoggin and Scott Donie got their chances today. <p> Boxing <p> American Eric Griffin 's controversial loss has driven home a point that boxers already had begun to recognize. " People are having to change their style because of the way the judging has been, and that 's terrible, " said NBC analyst Al Bernstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what you have is that it looks like they 're all loading up for one big punch. Body shots are meaningless, and combinations are meaningless unless they 're three-punch combinations. Chris Byrd 's father told him to throw a soft jab, hard jab and straight left hand in combination, and they 'll see the straight left and score it. " The Americans on today 's schedule are Larry Donald, Tim Austin, Montell Griffin and Raul Marquez. " The Marquez fight against Orhan Delibas of the Netherlands should be one of the best slugging matches, " Bernstein said. <p> Weightlifting <p> NBC probably feels duty-bound to televise Americans Mark Henry and Mario Martinez in the super heavyweight final, but it 's only for show. Neither has a chance to medal. " Henry could be a factor down the road, and one to watch when the Games come to Atlanta, " said NBC announcer John Dockery. " But the battle for the gold will be between 31-year-old Alexandre Kourlovitch and 36-year-old Leonid Taranenko, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good battle because the winner could set an Olympic record. " Weightlifting will be included on the prime-time schedule tonight primarily because there 's no track and field. But Dockery and analyst Todd Christensen, a pair of ex-NFL players, will take the air time any way they can get it. " As a good broadcaster, you become versed in what you do, and we 've been at the competition for the last eight or nine nights, " Dockery said. " Basically, the competitors have 1 1/2 minutes to make the lift, and we usually have to fill for 45 seconds, so I just really do a set-up to give Todd time to say something personal about the athlete like he eats plenty of ice cream and cake to keep his we ight up. " <p> Equestrian <p> Team jumping finals. <p> The U.S. team of Charlotte Bredahl, Robert Dover, Carol Lavell and Michael Poulin took the bronze in team dressage Monday. <p> The U.S. jumpers are expected to fare well. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The U.S. team beat up on Spain and takes on the Netherlands next. The U.S. team is 2-1 and the Netherlands 1-2. And even though the U.S. defeated the Unified Team, the Unified Team got first place in its pool and received the automatic bye that went with it. The placing and the bye were determined by the ratio of sets won to sets lost during the tournament. <p> AMERICANS TO WATCH <p> Caren Kemner is playing big. Against Spain she had 14 kills. <p> Wrestling <p> Freestyle preliminaries continue. <p> Zeke Jones, the world champion at 114 1/2-pounds, seems headed for his first Olympic medal. <p> Jones, from Bloomsburg, Pa., has two victories, including one over his longtime nemesis, Alfredo Leyva of Cuba. <p> Jones, 25, is an Olympic rookie and had an 0-3 mark against Leyva. But in his first match in Barcelona, he turned an early 0-1 deficit into a 16-1 victory. <p> Among wrestlers seeing their first action tonight will be Kenny Monday, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Quarterfinals matches. <p> Coach Joe Byrd has become so gun-shy since Griffin lost a controversial, computer-marred decision, that he is telling his boxers to watch where the five judges are sitting at ringside. <p> Three judges sit on one side of the ring and two on the other. Byrd is warning his fighters not to block the line of vision of the two. <p> MORNING HIGHLIGHTS Track and Field <p> Qualifying in the women 's 100-meter hurdles and 1,500. <p> AMERICANS TO WATCH <p> Gail Devers, the surprise winner in the 100 meter, and Lynda Tolbert should be in the medal hunt here. Devers was second in the Tokyo World Championships. But Lyudmila Narozhilenko of the Unified Team is considered the odds-on favorite. <p> Just as on the men 's track team, the U.S. women are not particularly strong over the longer distances. In the 1,500 look for Lyudmila Rogachova of the Unified Team, Doina Melinte of Romania and Hassiba Boulmerka of Algeria. <p> Tennis <p> Semifinals in women 's singles and men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. women. Since the three American men are out of the Olympics, taking their lumps in a surprisingly easy manner, it is up to the American women to carry the day. <p> Because of the loss of the men, television is cutting back on its coverage. Still, Jennifer Capriati and Mary Joe Fernandez are still alive in women 's singles. <p> The bad news is, so is Steffi Graf. <p> Basketball <p> Women 's semifinals. <p> The U.S. women are the most fun basketball team to watch at the Olympics. They should take another step toward winning the gold. <p> Today 's TV schedule at a glance 7:30 p.m. -midnight <p> Basketball : Men 's quarterfinals. <p> Diving : Men 's platform final. <p> Boxing : Quarterfinals. <p> Weightlifting : Super heavyweight( 242.5 pounds <p> and more) final. <p> Equestrian : Team jumping final. <p> 12:35-2:05 a.m. <p> Volleyball : Women 's quarterfinals. <p> Freestyle wrestling <p> Boxing : Quarterfinals.
