3042741 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unthinkable happens : The son of Oscar Madison, legendary slob, announces his engagement to the daughter of Felix Unger, compulsive fussbudget. As mismatched as Oscar 's socks, those former roommates are forced to reunite and share a rental car to the California wedding. They 've barely seen each other for 30 years but they immediately resume their archetypal behavior : Oscar( Walter Matthau) puffing a big stinky cigar with the windows rolled up over the protestations of Felix( Jack Lemmon) and his trick sinuses( the actors created the film roles in 1968, long before they morphed into " Grumpy Old Men. ") <p> In short order, cigar ash falls on the road map in Oscar 's lap, a flaming map goes out the window. One disaster leads to another until the boys find themselves on foot, dusted with crop insecticide, lost in a rural area of the Golden State where the only language spoken appears to be Spanish. <p> Neil Simon, the playwright-screenwriter who has made more people laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business( 30 plays, 25 screenplays), still has an unerring eye and ear and nose for what 's funny. He also has, at 71, something he lacked when the first " Odd Couple " opened on Broadway in 1965 : a feel for drama. A classic late bloomer, Simon won his 1991 Pulitzer Prize for " Lost in Yonkers " at 64, an age when most American playwrights are n't even trying to pretend they 're still in top form. <p> And the hand of that older, wiser, gentler Simon is clear even amid the road-picture antics of " Odd Couple II, " which opened Friday at area theaters. <p> " I have some sweeter moments in this movie, " says Simon, relaxing in an Atlanta hotel suite on a promotional tour, his moon face, as always, pleasant, owlishly unblinking and inscrutably bland. <p> " There 's a scene in the middle of the night when Felix wakes up scared and confused as old people are apt to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oscar, being Oscar, says, ' Ehhhhh, what 's your problem, go back to sleep! ' But it 's clear that there 's a very deep and lasting relationship between these men. <p> " Now a scene like that would have stopped the first ' Odd Couple ' in its tracks because it was pure comedy, " Simon continues, with a faint remnant in his voice of his native Bronx. <p> " But I 'm not sure I could have written the scene 30 years ago. Writers, like painters, go through phases. You age, you grow, you see life. " <p> Simon 's serious phase developed only after his 40th birthday, by which time he was already a wealthy king of Broadway with other such 1960s hits as " Barefoot in the Park " and " Plaza Suite. " But he 's always been notorious for using intimate details of his and family members ' lives as grist for his work. He even refers to himself as a monster( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) for this familiar writer 's practice. <p> The real-life model for Felix is his brother Danny Simon, his writing partner during the golden age of TV comedy, who hatched the idea for the play while living with a sub-sanitary sportswriter. But it was the Simon boys ' mother, Mamie, who was organizer of the rowdy Oscar-style poker parties in their New York apartment, charging admission to help support the family when father Irving disappeared for months at a time. <p> His 1977 play " Chapter Two, " Simon says, reflected his struggle to come to terms with the memory of his first, late wife, Joan Baim, while he was setting up housekeeping with second wife, Marsha Mason. <p> Simon sent " The Gingerbread Lady, " a portrait of an actress with a drinking problem and the first of his darker stage comedies, to Maureen Stapleton, and it struck so close to home that she called him back to unleash a tirade of name-calling that ca n't be printed in this paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and added, " When do we start rehearsal? " <p> Little wonder, then, that Diane Lander Simon( his third and current wife) put into their prenuptial contract that he can not write about her or her daughter while they 're still living. <p> In spite of the commercial success, and the careful, gradual darkening of his work, Simon in his early 50s still had little respect from the arbiters of taste. In 1978 critic John Simon( no relation, obviously) called the playwright 's characters " machines, humanoid contraptions that chop life down to one-liners. " A sea change came with the full-bodied autobiographical trilogy of the mid- ' 80s : " Brighton Beach Memoirs, " " Biloxi Blues, " " Broadway Bound. " The last one gazed so unflinchingly -- yet forgivingly -- at Mamie and Irving 's loveless marriage that Neil and Danny wept openly when they watched a performance together. <p> " Yonkers " captured the homelessness that the boys felt after the divorce, shuttled among relatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " based on Simon 's courtship of his adored Joan( " It 's taken me so many years to be able to write about it, " he says) fizzled on Broadway last fall. He says he has no doubt the play will succeed when it moves out of range of jaded New York critics, in London next year, and -- who knows? -- maybe places like Atlanta right after that. <p> In the meantime Simon is happy to revisit Felix and Oscar, names that have entered the culture as synonyms for keeper of order and creator of chaos. <p> Matthau, for whom Oscar was written( although he originally complained he 'd be better as Felix, amazingly enough), urged Simon to write a film sequel to " Odd Couple " nine years ago. The writer says, " I suddenly saw Oscar at a poker table with nothing but elderly ladies and I knew that image had to be in the film, " so he transplanted Oscar to Sarasota, Fla., among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball. Felix has become successful in business but less so in love. His aggravating quirks have precipitated three divorces -- he has been widowed once and divorced twice ; he and Lander remarried in 1988, so he 's unprepared for the autumnal romance that the sequel brings his way. <p> Unlike so many Simon films, which were " opened up " from his plays, " Odd Couple II " is pure movie : Picaresque misadventures stretched out among fast food joints, honky-tonks( and in a recurring gag, a police station) along western highways. <p> But what does a millionaire playwright from the Bronx actually know of such a world? <p> " You 'd be surprised, " Simons says with a sly grin. " I have the worst sense of direction in the world. In New York, everything makes sense, 61st street comes after 60th and so on. But, in California, I spend of my time being lost. Marsha( Mason) used to have to drive me everywhere. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head, and the next thing you know I 'm in Modesto. " <p> Simon is reminded that Sam Shepard literally writes -- legal pad against the steering wheel -- while he drives. <p> " Good God, " mutters the writer, " I 'd have killed half of California by now. " Late bloomer : Neil Simon, in Atlanta on a promotional tour for " Odd Couple II, " reflects on his rich, award-winning career. / ALICIA HANSEN / Staff
