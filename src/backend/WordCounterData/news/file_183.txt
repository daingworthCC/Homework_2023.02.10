3035041 <p> It was a pretty good year for Washington area home builders and media companies and a great one for fast-sprouting firms that hook up people to trendy interactive information networks. Meanwhile, a number of defense contractors were fighting to survive and the biotech industry spent another year in the incubator. <p> The story of the region 's top 100 publicly traded firms emerges from such distinct, different rhythms of companies within clusters of core industries. The sectors reflect the region 's past and future : biotechnology, communications, defense and government contracting, finance and insurance, health, manufacturing, media, real estate and construction, retailing, technology, and transportation and energy. <p> The Top 100 are the standard-bearers of a regional economy that includes 177,000 businesses of all sizes, from Fairfax-based Mobil Corp., with $ 67 billion in worldwide revenue last year and 3,500 local employees, to neighborhood dry cleaners and home office consultants. As publicly traded companies that issue financial reports each quarter, the Top 100 companies -- through their successes and failures -- mark broad currents of change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run on identical fuel or at the same pace, as last year 's successes within the technology and real estate sectors make plain. <p> Real estate has benefited over the past two years from the economic forces of supply and demand : Home buyers who put off purchases during the 1991-92 recession have been back in the market in earnest since then, helping both builders and retailers. <p> Although sales of new homes in the region tailed off slightly last year from 1993 's pace, the industry 's leaders piled up solid revenue gains, while the commercial construction industry enjoyed its best results since the beginning of a devastating recession in 1988. <p> For the first time in a decade, Ryland Group Inc. had prospective home buyers camping out overnight for a crack at new $ 140,000 to $ 160,000 town houses near its Columbia headquarters. Its revenue rose more than 11 percent. <p> Revenue from McLean-based NVR Inc. ' s home-building business, the largest in the area, grew by the same amount in 1994, its first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception was Washington Homes Inc. in Landover, whose earnings tumbled by one-third in the last half of the year as higher interest rates trimmed sales. <p> The high-tech sector 's energy is more localized, derived from a base of knowledge in computer networking, information processing, biotechnology and satellite systems that has long been nurtured by government contracts. <p> Many of the technology sector 's best performers produced double-digit revenue gains or better. Heading that list was America Online Inc. in Vienna, a supplier of on-line services to computer users, which seemed to clone new customers as its revenue tripled last year. Satellite maker Orbital Sciences Corp. in Sterling jumped into the top ranks of local employers after acquiring Fairchild Space and Defense Corp. and absorbing its 800 employees in Germantown and Greenbelt. <p> The region benefited from a large increase in federal purchases last year. Contracts of all kinds totaled $ 15.1 billion in the region, compared with $ 13.6 billion in 1993 and $ 13.1 billion the year before. <p> But the continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal agencies dealt some sharp blows to Beltway contractors and appeared to trouble consumers as well. <p> After suffering a $ 2 million loss during the last six months of 1994 -- the beginning of its 1995 fiscal year -- Penril Datacomm Networks Inc. in Gaithersburg is actively trying to sell units that produce military power supply equipment. <p> Computer Data Systems Inc. in Rockville was jarred by the loss of several major contracts that produced nearly 40 percent of its revenue in the previous year. <p> A psychological effect of government downsizing is suggested by a February poll by the Greater Washington Consumer Survey Inc. in which one-third of the respondents assume the region 's economy will be worse off a year from now -- although nearly 45 percent thought they will be better off personally. <p> Ronald D. Kirstien, chief executive of DavCo Restaurants Inc. in Crofton, Md., believes that consumer anxiety dampened sales at his company 's Wendy 's franchises throughout the region. Although DavCo reported a healthy increase in revenue last year, that came mostly from acquisitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " We were flat in 1994, " Kirstien said. " It was n't bad and it was n't tremendously good. " He added : " There 's a strong indication of a loss of confidence about whether the economy is really working. " <p> Officials at Hechinger Co. in Landover do n't know whether consumer anxiety is a factor, but like DavCo, the home improvement company 's growth in 1994 primarily resulted from adding stores. Sales at most existing stores typically showed meager growth at best. <p> At Giant Food Inc., the region 's largest retailer, sales grew by 3.6 percent, better than the grocery industry 's average nationwide. But sales at existing stores were less than 1 percent higher. <p> While Landover-based Giant provides a local leader for the retail sector, most clusters are dominated by national or multinational firms based in the area, whose financial performance and employment changes shed little, if any, light on the region 's economy. <p> Two defense companies -- the newly merged Lockheed Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falls Church -- dwarf other local defense companies. The same is true for the District 's MCI Communications Corp. in telecommunications and Mobil Corp. in energy. Harman International Industries Inc., whose speakers, home theater systems and other audio products made it one of the region 's most successful manufacturers last year, keeps only a small headquarters staff in the District. <p> Among the firms whose roots are deep in the region, Riggs National Corp. in the District marked its revival from four tortuous years of losses with a $ 34 million profit last year. <p> Mid Atlantic Medical Services in Rockville capitalized on employers ' drive to reduce the costs of medical benefits with a 27 percent increase in membership in its health maintenance organizations and other managed care plans. Its earnings rose nearly 120 percent. <p> BET Holdings Inc. in the District profited from the addition of more than 1 million subscribers to its cable television subsidiary, Black Entertainment Television. Its earnings were up 17 percent. <p> In most clusters, the weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for employment growth, the region depends on the smaller members of the Top 100. The 15 largest firms on the list whose businesses are based primarily in the region boosted revenue by an average of 10 percent last year. But heeding pressures to control costs, they did not pad payrolls, increasing employment by less than 2 percent on average. <p> Jobs were created largely by smaller high-tech companies with the often inscrutable names occupying the midsection of the Top 100. Many have been turning their expertise in data-processing applications into expanding niche businesses. <p> Manugistics Inc., a software and consulting services company in Rockville that helps companies control their inventories and supplies, has profited from corporate enthusiasm for reengineering and productivity goals. Its revenue rose by one third last year. <p> Micros Systems Inc. in Beltsville continues to find customers for its " touch-screen " computer terminals that retail and restaurant workers use to place orders without keyboards. GTS Duratek Inc., based in Columbia, has a unique process for converting radioactive and hazardous wastes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Its prospects enticed the Carlyle Group, the District 's leading private merchant bank, to acquire control of the company last year. <p> However, ICF Kaiser International Inc. in Fairfax is still waiting for its consulting know-how in toxic waste cleanup and other engineering problems to produce solid profit gains. <p> BTG Corp. in Vienna, which moved onto the Top 100 list after a successful initial public offering of its stock in December, is, in many ways, a model of these niche companies. Starting from scratch in 1982, it has exceeded $ 100 million in annual revenue by selling computer-based systems for transmitting and analyzing intelligence to military and security agencies. <p> Now, says chief executive Edward H. Bersoff, BTG is pinning much of its hopes for commercial expansion on the Internet, the vast network of computer networks. <p> BTG 's strategy is to help companies, government agencies and private institutions tailor their own ways of plugging into the network to get the best access to its dizzying expanse of data libraries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Morino, founder and former chief executive of Legent Corp. in Herndon, who now runs his own foundation, Northern Virginia has a good chance at becoming the nation 's leading hub of Internet expertise by drawing on the area 's large contingent of network and information technology specialists -- many of whom got their start on federal contracts. <p> " If you look at the emerging Internet providers, they 're here, " Morino said. <p> " If we 're smart, this will be the region 's flagship technology, " Bersoff echoed. <p> Similar hopes have been sounded for years about Maryland 's biotech industry, the nation 's third-largest concentration of life science firms. Although the Maryland firms have grown faster than any other biotech cluster in the country, they have not yet achieved a breakthrough into product manufacturing that would make a real contribution to the region 's wealth and employment. <p> Human Genome Sciences Inc. in Rockville, a leader in the isolation of human genes for the future detection, prevention and treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with support from pharmaceutical giant SmithKline Beecham Corp. and its 1993 public stock offering. <p> But its products still lie in the future, said chief executive William A. Haseltine. The industry 's immediate growth is hampered by a shortage of investment capital, Haseltine said, and the arrival of significant manufacturing operations still may be three to five years away. <p> The area 's technology companies repeatedly cite a shortage of investment capital as their greatest problem, said Roger Stough, director of regional analysis at George Mason University 's Institute of Public Policy in Fairfax. If it is not addressed, " It will delay the development of these companies, " he said. " It is the single, top priority. " *
