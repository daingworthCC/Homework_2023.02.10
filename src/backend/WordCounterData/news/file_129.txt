3026741 <p> While turmoil rocks world currency markets, hot times are brewing in another part of the currency universe - the usually dull-as-dirt security- printing industry. <p> About a dozen companies, including two U.S. firms, craft and print currency, passports, stamps, stock certificates and other pieces of paper that hold together a society. <p> The world has never seen so many countries emerge at the same time. Fifteen have been created in the past year out of the former Soviet Union alone. All want their own documents of sovereignty. They want them now. And the security printers are scrambling to grab all the new business they can handle. <p> " Is this an incredible time? You bet it is, " says Stanley Kreitman, president of New York-based U.S. Banknote, the biggest U.S. security printer and No. 2 in the world behind Thomas De La Rue of London. " We have people in Russia now, and in Turkmenistan and Georgia and Moldova and Belarus. We had a pretty good head start. We thought( the Soviet break up) was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources to the region. " <p> U.S. Banknote is producing initial batches of Lithuania 's litas currency and Estonia 's kroon. It has printed stock certificates for privatized industries in Russia and Czechoslovakia. Kreitman figures business from emerging countries will boost his company 's revenue - which was $ 161 million last year - for years to come. So far, the new business has been too small to make an impact, but the best is yet to come. Some analysts say U.S. Banknote 's stock, now at $ 4 5/8, could hit $ 20 a share in five years. <p> The other U.S. security printer, Banknote Corp. of America, is much smaller - about $ 40 million in 1991 revenue. CEO Martin Ferenczi says a couple of big contracts could double BCA 's annual revenue. BCA does n't have any big emerging-country contracts of its own. But BCA is the U.S. unit of French printer Francois-Charles Oberthur Group. The group is printing 60 million Ukrainian passports and currency for Azerbaijan and Moldova. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency is loaded with the most drama. <p> For starters, the security end of the business means everything from armed guards to invisible marks on bills to deter counterfeiters. <p> Beyond that, currency is a statement. Bosnia-Herzegovina announced it will issue its own money as a gesture of defiance against Serbia. The two are at war in what was Yugoslavia. Former Soviet republics are using currency as a way to break from Russia - Ukraine just threw a festival to announce it will unveil its currency, the grivna, in December. <p> As a statement, design becomes a touchy issue. Who will be on the notes? What words? <p> " It 's amazing. You can see history evolving through these new banknote issues, " says Colin Bruce, editor of Bank Note Reporter, a collectors ' magazine that is trying to keep up with the fast pace of change in the currency industry. <p> Like any product, the process starts with sales calls and research. In Lithuania, for instance, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed independence in August 1991. The first task was to figure out who would be in charge of the new finance ministry or central bank. The second was to make their pitch : a fair price, top-notch help in designing the bills and timely delivery. <p> The third task in such situations is to find out if the new country will have the hard currency to pay for its order. " You also want to determine if the government might change, " says Ferenczi, " and if it does, if they 'll honor the same contract. " <p> Ferenczi and Kreitman agree that the top security printers offer about the same quality and service. They compete mostly on price. Price is based on how many bills and denominations a country needs( Lithuania ordered 300 million bills in seven denominations) and the security it desires. Security refers to devices used to ward off counterfeiting, including details in the design, watermarks on the paper and metal threads woven into the bills. The more security, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is signed, the country and the printer start working on designs. That 's when things can take odd twists. " Usually, they hire a designer and he works with our designers, " says Kreitman. " But one country wanted to have a competition. It had artists send in designs, and they picked from that. " <p> Most countries want national heroes - politicians, poets, scientists - on the front and symbols, monuments or buildings on the back. Lithuania 's 10- litas note has a World War I plane on back. Its 1,000-litas note pictures a religious scene. All of Lithuania 's money has people on front. In his office, Kreitman looks at faces on the Lithuanian money his company is printing and says, " Who are they? I have no idea. That was done by the Lithuanians. " <p> " The country tells us who or what they want " on the bills, says Ferenczi. " Then we build a model, and then we go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, we work it out. " <p> Once designs are settled on, engravers start making the intricate plates used to print money. Engraving and proofing plates can take three to four months. The process, from signing the contract to delivery, took about 16 months for Lithuania and Estonia. <p> Delivery is the final responsibility of the security printer. The money is bound in shrink wrap, put into locked boxes and stacked in sealed, truck- size containers for shipping. Armed guards stay with the containers at all times. Most times, a country 's military meets the shipment at the dock and escorts it to central bank vaults. <p> " We do n't sneak it in, but we do n't advertise what boat it 's coming in on, either, " Kreitman says. The process is pretty much the same, though less intense, for passports, stock certificates, postage stamps and other security- printing items. <p> Demand is going nowhere but up for the likes of BCA and U.S. Banknote. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, all wanting their own currencies and documents. Czechoslovakia is breaking in two. <p> ' These are truly extraordinary times, " says Ferenczi, speaking for both his industry and history. Money is n't just a piece of paper for the newly formed countries of the world. <p> Currency is a tangible symbol of independence and autonomy. A currency 's design reflects a statement the new country is trying to make about itself - either harkening back to its history as a formerly independent nation or looking to the future. Pictured are poets, politicians, nature or famous buildings. <p> Some examples of new currencies and what the symbols mean : Estonian kroon <p> Status : Just introduced <p> Printer : U.S. Banknote <p> Value : A kroon equals about 8 1/2 cents. <p> Artwork : Medieval Tallinn Castle where Estonia 's Parliament meets.
