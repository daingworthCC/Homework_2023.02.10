3065241 <p> Roundy 's Supermarkets, a Milwaukee-based grocery chain run by a Chicago native, is entering the market here in a big way : <p> - It will open its first store in the Chicago market at the New City YMCA site, 1515 N. Halsted, and plans to open a dozen more in the next three years. <p> - It is looking to take over some of 14 soon-to-be-closed Dominick 's stores. <p> - And it wants to open a food emporium and grocery store in the Carson Pirie Scott building on State Street, CEO Robert Mariano, a native of the Jefferson Park neighborhood, said Monday. <p> The Roundy 's stores in Chicago will have a new name and a unique format. <p> The grocery store on the YMCA site in the gentrified North and Clybourn corridor, scheduled to open in the summer of 2008, will be the first of 13 stores Roundy 's will open in Chicago in the next three years, employing 2,000, said Mariano, a former CEO of Dominick 's grocery stores who was responsible for launching Dominick 's " Fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disclose details of the new grocery store format, but an analyst speculated that Roundy 's will be going after the higher-income customer. Roundy 's statement noted that its first 80,000-square-foot store at the YMCA site will focus on " fresh offerings in produce, meat and seafood, bakery and deli. " <p> Said Mariano : " The format will be to suit each neighborhood a store serves. " <p> The YMCA announced last July that it planned to sell its New City YMCA property for construction of a residential and retail center. The development will include retail stores on the first and second floors of a mid-rise condo building. <p> The Sun-Times reported Thursday that a " hybrid " grocery store and food emporium to serve the Loop 's burgeoning population of residents and college students will anchor retail development of the landmark State Street building that includes soon-to-be-closed Carson Pirie Scott &; Co. <p> Mariano said he would be interested in being the grocer at the Carson 's building. <p> " We 're looking at it, " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the area and the need for take-out food for breakfast, lunch and dinner -- there is an absolute need. " <p> Mariano has wanted to put a grocery store and cafe in the Loop for several years. He first tried to open a store at the northeast corner of Randolph and State. He got a pledge of $7.9 million in tax-increment financing to buy a low-rise building on the site about seven years ago but could n't make the finances work. <p> " We are very interested in the Loop, " Mariano said. " We 'll look at everything that 's possible in downtown and the surrounding downtown area. " <p> A spokesman for the owner of the Carson 's building said no negotiations are taking place or have taken place with Roundy 's. <p> " That 's not to say we would n't be interested in talking to them, " said Paul Fitzpatrick, managing director of Joseph Freed &; Associates. <p> Freed is negotiating with several other food operations, but it 's yet to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money to operate in the Carson 's building, Fitzpatrick said. <p> Why is Roundy 's entering the Chicago area now, after four years of rumors that it wanted to buy the Dominick 's grocery chain? <p> One reason could be Dominick 's shrinking presence. Dominick 's announced on Feb. 2 that it will close 14 stores by early April, leaving it with 83 in the Chicago area. <p> A Dominick 's spokeswoman said, " We 're not worried about what other grocers are doing. We 're focused on doing what we do best. " <p> Dominick 's parent company, Safeway, is investing $80 million to $100 million to renovate profitable stores and build new ones in the " Lifestyle " format, featuring hardwood floors, hearth-fired pizza, Starbucks cafes, olive bars, organic foods and expanded wine selections to better compete with rivals as diverse as Jewel-Osco, Whole Foods, Trader Joe 's and Wal-Mart. <p> Mariano said some of the 14 soon-to-be-shuttered Dominick 's would " make a lot of sense " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, an analyst at Chicago-based Morningstar, said " Roundy 's wo n't make money by building a few stores. They have to be looking at gaining a large market share. " <p> Mariano said he has known since he joined Roundy 's in 2002 that " there were opportunities in Chicago. " He said he first had to redo Roundy 's operations by selling off the distribution business and expanding its retail store base. <p> Mariano, who was ousted as CEO of Dominick 's when Safeway took over the chain, said Dominick 's loss of market share in the Chicago area -- to 14 percent from about 24 percent in 1998 -- shows what customers think of how the Dominick 's chain has been run by its California-based owner. <p> He said " we will see " how Safeway 's new strategy of upgrading its grocery stores to " Lifestyle " formats works out. <p> Asked if he would want to take over the Dominick 's chain, Mariano said, " I have learned not to say never.
