3056341 <p> ST. PAUL, Minn. - With the mammoth task of paying for college stressing many households, parents and students need to take advantage of every opportunity they can to stretch education savings. <p> One of the best ways to do that is by using the tax system. <p> With the clock ticking toward the end of the tax year, households can use the next few weeks to reduce this year 's income and position themselves to get the best education tax benefits possible in 2001 and 2002. Thinking about next year takes on extra significance because that 's when enhanced tax advantages kick in. <p> So consider the following. <p> Take advantage of Hope or Lifetime credits for kids in college. If you have a child in college this year, you do n't want to miss out on either the Hope or Lifetime college credits because you can get as much as $ 1,500 back from Uncle Sam for higher education expenses if your income qualifies. <p> To qualify, it 's critical to pay attention now to your adjusted gross income. That 's your income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and Dec. 31, you may stand a better chance of meeting income limits for the tax credits when you fill out your 2001 tax return. <p> Your right to take the tax credits is " phased out " for adjusted gross income between $ 40,000 and $ 50,000 for single individuals, or between $ 80,000 and $ 100,000 for married couples who file jointly. So the lower your income within those parameters, the larger your potential tax credit. <p> To lower your income, consider contributing more money now to a 401(k) plan at work, opening a deductible IRA, billing a client next year for work you are completing this year or delaying a bonus until January. <p> Also sell stocks or mutual funds that have declined in value since you purchased them so you can produce a capital loss. But avoid selling any investment before year 's end if it will give you a gain. <p> Either a financially independent student or a parent paying for a dependent child can qualify for the education tax credit if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. So make sure the student is taking enough classes now to qualify. <p> Also, if your income is too high for the credit, consider dropping plans to claim your child as a dependent. If the child is not a dependent, she probably has an income that would allow taking full advantage of the credit herself. <p> Keep in mind that the credit wo n't exceed actual expenses, so you will only be covered for up to 100 percent of $ 1,500 in educational costs. <p> Remember that the Hope credit can be claimed for only the first two years of college or technical school. So if the student is close to becoming a junior, and you want the $ 1,500 Hope credit for this year, make sure the student does n't complete enough courses to become a junior before Dec. 31. <p> After the first two years of college, however, you can still claim the Lifetime credit. Although it 's capped at $ 1,000 a year, you can take the credit for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pay student loan interest for a deduction. If you are paying interest on student loans and are within income requirements, you can deduct up to $ 2,500 in interest each year - even if you do n't itemize on your tax form. <p> Singles with incomes below $ 40,000 can get the full deduction, and partial deductions are possible up to $ 55,000. Married couples filing jointly get the full deduction if their income is up to $ 60,000 and a partial deduction with income up to $ 75,000. <p> If your income qualifies for the deduction and you have n't paid $ 2,500 in interest yet this year, consider making your January payment in December to enhance your deduction, says Joseph Hurley, a Pittsford, N.Y., certified public accountant. <p> Keep in mind, however, that income limits for the student loan deduction are changing next year - with the phase-out occurring between $ 50,000 and $ 60,000 for singles and $ 100,000 and $ 130,000 for couples. So if your income is too high for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your December interest in January if you do n't incur a sizable penalty. <p> Wait to withdraw 529 funds next year. If you have a child in college, and a 529 college savings plan to fund the expenses, consider waiting until next year to withdraw 529 money. <p> If you wait, you will be able to remove the money next year without paying any federal taxes on the withdrawals. That 's because a new federal law goes into effect in 2002. Between then and the end of 2010, any student using 529 money for college or technical education will not have to pay any taxes on the money from the plan. <p> This year, however, the old rules apply. So if students withdraw 529 money during the rest of 2001 for college, they will owe income taxes on the withdrawals based on their tax rates. <p> If you do leave the money in the 529 plan until next year, beware of one sticky issue, warns Hurley. If your child ends his or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will face a penalty for taking out the remaining funds. <p> That can be overcome, however, if you shift the remaining funds to a sibling or other student by naming a new beneficiary of the account. You could also leave the money in the 529 plan under the old beneficiary 's name, so the student could use it later for graduate education. <p> Tap your losing 529 plan for a loss. If you have lost money in your 529 plan since opening it, you may be able to take a tax deduction. <p> But in order to take the loss, Hurley notes, you must withdraw the entire account. <p> You can take this loss only if you itemize on your taxes rather than using the short form. You would take the deduction as " miscellaneous " on Schedule A. In order to take such deductions, they must all total 2 percent of your adjusted gross income. <p> Make sure you meet that threshold before withdrawing your 529 plan money, Hurley says. Also make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax, and keep in mind that although IRS rules appear to allow this deduction, there is no official guidance that specifically addresses the situation, he says. <p> Also, if a student qualifies for financial aid, be cautious about withdrawing 529 plan money until the end of the junior year because 529 accounts reduce financial aid. <p> Wait to withdraw education IRA funds until next year. With new tax laws going into effect in 2002, using Education IRAs will become more attractive. In 2001, they carry a lot of unpleasant baggage. <p> In particular, if you think you will qualify for the Hope or Lifetime credits this year, do n't take money out of an Education IRA for the rest of 2001. That 's because the current law does n't let you claim the tax credits in the same year you use an Education IRA. Next year, however, you can use the Education IRA and also claim the tax credits, says Hurley. <p> Until then, however, there is other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other relatives have contributed money to both 529 college savings plans and Education IRAs during the same year for the same student, the student owes a 6 percent excise tax for the years when the contributions were made, Hurley says. <p> So if family members were making contributions to both an Education IRA and 529 plan for 1999, 2000 and 2001, the tax is required on all three years. <p> <p> HIGHLIGHTS <p> These are only general points of some of the differences among some of the tax benefits available to you if you pay higher-education costs.
