3043241 <p> A manhunt spread across the West today as authorities searched for the man who walked into a Jewish community center and fired more than 70 bullets from an assault-style gun before slipping away and vanishing in metropolitan Los Angeles. <p> Investigators followed his trail across the city, from the shell casings that littered the center 's lobby to the abandoned red-and-white van filled with ammunition, bulletproof vests, explosives, freeze-dried food and a booklet titled Ranger Handbook. The trail led to a green Toyota Corolla he was believed to have stolen and then left in front of a motel a few miles from the community center. <p> Officers evacuated guests from the Chatsworth motel as SWAT team members took up positions on surrounding roofs. Canine units swarmed the area as federal investigators moved in, turning a busy intersection into an armed camp. <p> But at 11 p.m. PST, police said they had not been able to find the suspect. <p> " We were so close but still he managed to get away, " Cmdr. David Kalish said. <p> The motive remained uncertain following the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nation struggling with seemingly mounting and pointless violence. Among the wounded were three young children, one of them critically injured. <p> " There was nothing said by the suspect before the shooting, " Police Chief Bernard Parks said. " It was indiscriminate. " <p> Officials said it was unknown whether the center was targeted because the students were Jewish, but the Simon Wiesenthal Center said a book was found in the van written by the American Nazi Party. The Union of American Hebrew Congregations advised its synagogues and Jewish schools to tighten security. <p> The suspect was identified by police as Buford Oneal Furrow, a 37-year-old white man who was believed to have lived in California and Washington state. <p> Police arrived four minutes after Tuesday morning 's shooting, gun smoke still lingering in the lobby of the suburban community center, Kalish said. The gunman had already disappeared, leaving behind the wounded : three young boys attending day camp, a 16-year-old counselor and a 68-year-old receptionist. Furrow fled in a van and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have fanned out across California and Washington state. FBI agents visited the Olympia, Wash., home of a man believed to be Furrow 's father Tuesday night, but refused to answer questions. <p> The abandoned van was purchased Saturday from the Tacoma( Wash.) Kar Korner, said the manager of the lot, who refused to be identified. Kalish identified Furrow as the buyer of the van, which had Washington plates. <p> Furrow was sentenced in May to eight months in jail for second-degree assault with a deadly weapon, KOMO-TV in Seattle reported Tuesday night. He never reported to the King County Jail as ordered. <p> The violence was the latest shooting at workplaces and schools across the country, and President Clinton and others spoke out. <p> " Once again, our nation has been shaken and our hearts torn by gun violence, " Clinton said in Washington. " It calls on all of us not only to give our thoughts and prayers to the victims and their families, but intensify our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most seriously injured was a 5-year-old boy, shot in the abdomen and leg. He was in critical condition after six hours of surgery and his prognosis for recovery was fair. <p> " He had a great desire to live and we supported that effort, " said surgeon Clarence Sutton Jr. at Providence Holy Cross Medical Center. <p> Two 6-year-old boys and the teenage counselor were in stable condition at hospitals. The receptionist, Isabelle Shalometh, was released from a hospital Tuesday night. <p> The day was marked by tragedy, uncertainty and -- for parents whose children escaped unharmed -- elation tempered by anxiety. <p> About two dozen children were in the center when the gunman burst into the North Valley Jewish Community Center and began spraying the lobby with bullets at 10:50 a.m., said Capt. Steve Ruda of the Los Angeles Fire Department. The exact make of the gun was not immediately released, though Ruda said he believed it was a 9mm Uzi. <p> The toll could have been higher. About 250 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the gunman opened fire. <p> Shalometh, the receptionist, was taking a phone call at the front counter when the gunman began shooting, according to Shalometh 's son-in-law, Paul Goldin. <p> " When he fired the gun, she ducked under the counter, " Goldin said. " She yelled for people in the main office to get down. " <p> As she ducked down, Shalometh was grazed by bullets in the back and her arm, Goldin said. <p> The gunman then went down a short hallway in the center, shooting methodically, according to authorities. He then fled into the area behind the community center. <p> Four-year-old Gabrielle Fougner was inside when the firing began. <p> " I heard booming, " recalled the little girl dressed in blue shorts and a yellow T-shirt. <p> Brian Fougner, her 39-year-old father, found his daughter in a nearby park, where she and other children were taken from the center. <p> " When we first came, she told us a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " You hear about stuff in the news. Could this happen to me or could this happen to my children? Out here is exact proof, yes, it could. " <p> While SWAT teams were swarming around the community center and news and police helicopters buzzed overhead, about 20 small children were led from the building hand in hand and taken to a Jewish temple nearby. <p> Parents rushed to the center and jammed against police lines trying to find out if their children were all right. Some parents wept and hugged one another, waiting while authorities made sure of everyone 's identity. <p> Richard Macales prayed and recited psalms as he rushed to check on his children, ages 2 and 3. " My feeling about it is it 's another case of someone acting out in rage, " he said. " I do n't want to believe this is an act of anti-Semitism here in 1999. " <p> Macales, a public relations officer for the University of California, Los Angeles, told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to leave the country. <p> " I just talked to my wife and mother about moving the family back to Israel, " said Macales, who lives in the Northridge community. <p> " I feel there 's not much of a future for Jews in the United States, " he said. " It 's not an issue of anti-Semitism, but there 's a moral eclipse in America which leads to moral unaccountability in this country. " <p> Kathy Nissenbaum, who was picking up her 4 1/2-year-old daughter, could n't make sense of the tragedy either. <p> " You do so much to protect your child. I do n't know how much more we can do, " said Nissenbaum, who lives north of Los Angeles in Valencia, one of the country 's safest cities. " It 's frightening and random. And it 's scary to think that you ca n't always keep your kid safe. " <p> As police searched for the assailant, fear gripped some in the neighborhood, a community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valley suburbs 30 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. <p> " I was barricaded in my house all day, " said Nancie Crannell, who lives a block from the center with her husband. " I stayed away from the window. " <p> Carlos Escalante saw the shooting as a sign of the times. <p> " There 's sick people everywhere now, " said the 34-year-old, who lives three blocks away with his two children, age 10 and 13. " We 're not safe anywhere. " <p> California Gov. Gray Davis said, " Once again, we have been shocked, saddened and outraged by an act of vicious gun violence aimed against defenseless children and innocent adults. " He offered a $ 50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. <p> " Only evil could have perpetrated something like this against innocent children, " said California Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante. <p> U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein announced she would sponsor legislation requiring registration of all guns and licensing of all gun owners in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a " cowardly act.
