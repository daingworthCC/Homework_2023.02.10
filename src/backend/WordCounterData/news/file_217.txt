3041641 <p> It would be a fine Christmas. Not quite as joyous, certainly not as raucous as the previous one, when Mary Donnan had surprised her husband with a karaoke machine and Jim Donnan delighted( OK, amused) the family with song. He was Elvis, doing " Return to Sender. " He was Fats Domino, high atop " Blueberry Hill. " He was... Frankie Valli? Yes, Jim Donnan, who loves his rock ' n ' roll, was Frankie Valli, falsetto and all. <p> This Christmas loomed different, warm and familial yet more subdued. The fami ly had gathered at home in Huntington, W.Va., all three children and both grandchildren. Yet there was the lingering pain of Marshall 's recent loss to Montana in the Division I-AA national championship game. Even worse, it had been just seven days since Glen Mason, not Jim Donnan, was anointed as the new head football coach at Georgia. A decision that admittedly left Donnan " devastated. " <p> " Because I really thought I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Georgia job two days before Mason 's appointment. " I really thought I was that close. " <p> He was close, much closer than he 'd been in 1978 when Bill Dooley left North Carolina and the job went to the older outsider Dick Crum, not the young assistant-in-waiting Donnan. Of that disappointment, Donnan said, " Second place does n't help you any. " He paused. He grinned. " Except in this place it helped me. " <p> It was a miracle, really, a Christmas gift too preposterous for an O. Henry short story and even better than a karaoke machine. Vince Dooley called. And a life 's work, and ambition, were reborn on Christmas Day. <p> Donnan was out jogging, taking a four-mile run on campus when Dooley phoned at 1 p.m. Mary took the message and left it for her husband at the school. Vince Dooley called. He wants to talk to you. Donnan immediately phoned Mary. He told her to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donnan returned home. <p> " I did n't want him to call somebody else, " Donnan said. " Not that he 'd do that, but.... " <p> But you take no chances. You ask your wife to give Dooley the mobile number. When you 've toiled 27 years in coaching, when you 've spent 21 years as an assistant before landing your first head coaching position, when you 're 50 and the chance of a lifetime in a lifetime of chance appears at last, you do n't risk getting stuck at a red light while driving home and Vince Dooley ends up dialing, oh, Frank Beamer instead. <p> Fortunately, Dooley called back before the bombshell broke on the Aloha Bowl telecast : Mason had decided to remain at Kansas. Once that happened, Donnan was besieged with phone calls. They grew ceaseless that evening when Donnan 's hiring was reported at halftime of the Dallas- Arizona Monday Night Football telecast. In the subsequent 90 minutes, the Donnans had 58 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> " Like it was on the Internet, " said Donnan, who promptly changed his phone number. " That does n't include the beep-ins. " <p> That does, however, bespeak Donnan 's popularity( particularly in Huntington, where he remains revered) and the respect of his peers. Indeed, when Mason 's about-face was first aired that afternoon, it triggered a cavalcade of coaches calling. Including : <p> -Frank Broyles, who won a national championship at Arkansas and is the school 's athletic director. <p> -Bill Parcells, Donnan 's close friend since their early ' 70s days as Florida State assistants who won two Super Bowls with the New York Giants and wrote the foreword to Donnan 's autobiography, " Winning My Way. " <p> -And Barry Switzer, who phoned a few hours before his Cowboys played Christmas night, and for whom Donnan served as offensive coordinator at Oklahoma from 1985-88. <p> " They all asked, ' What 's going on? ' " recalled Donnan 's son, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help? ' " <p> No help needed, not this time. By nightfall, the job was officially Donnan 's. By this fall, Donnan will literally kick off an opportunity that, by every account, is as richly deserved as it was long overdue. <p> " In my opinion, he 's more qualified than the guy they hired and then changed his mind, " said Georgia Southern coach Tim Stowers, who knows Donnan and his Marshall teams well, having coached four times against the Thundering Herd. " He( Mason) had a losing record( overall). Also, Jim 's from the South. That helps. In the South, football 's a religion. Like it says in the Bible, Proverbs 26 : 22, ' Gossip is a dainty morsel eaten with great relish. ' People can not hear enough about college football. <p> " Jim understands that, and the nature of the job. He just knows how to get the job done. He knows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as recruiting, coaching and motivating players. And can you argue with success? " <p> By any measure, on any level, Donnan 's success at Marshall was dynastic. His six-year record : 64-21, despite a 6-5 debut. He won 12 games three times, made five consecutive I-AA playoff appearances, won the ' 92 national championship and thrice was runner-up. Marshall won the last two Southern Conference titles outright and perennially led the conference in all major statistical categories. Donnan 's 64 victories leave him one shy of Youngstown State 's Jim Tressel, college football 's winningest coach in the ' 90s. <p> None of this surprised Switzer. " We had great success at Oklahoma while he was there. We won something like 33 in a row, but we were 0-3 against Miami, " said Switzer, laughing at his little joke. " We won three Big Eight championships and two Orange Bowls in four years while he was there. " <p> And the 1985 national championship in Donnan 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a broken ankle in the fourth game. Donnan was hired primarily to restructure Oklahoma 's explosive wishbone attack, infusing a more sophisticated passing game suited to Aikman. When Aikman went down, Oklahoma simply went back to the wishbone and Donnan boned up on his triple option. And with Donnan calling the plays and freshman Jamelle Holieway at quarterback, the Sooners won their sixth( and last) national title. <p> As for those who fret over Donnan 's lack of head coaching experience on the Division I-A level, Switzer fairly spits. " Oh, hell. There 's good coaches on every level. There 's big-time college football and national championship teams. He was the offensive coordinator of a national championship team. He 'll be fine. " <p> Certainly, he 'll be confident, as Donnan was in late December of 1984. Switzer was in Miami then, preparing Oklahoma for the Orange Bowl. Donnan was home in Columbia, Mo., having completed his fourth season as quarterbacks coach at Missouri. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four tries. Whatever, Donnan phoned Switzer. <p> " I said, ' Coach, why do n't you let me come down there for a few days? And I 'll be able to watch the kids and have a big jump on spring practice, ' " Donnan recalled. " He said, ' Man, you 're pretty confident, are n't you? ' " <p> Yes, Switzer was impressed with Donnan, and not only as a coach. Donnan was at Kansas State from 1978-80 before going to Missouri and had established himself as a terrific recruiter. Not slick, just a genial guy who made people feel comfortable and laugh easily. Yet when Donnan offered to help out in Miami, Switzer had n't even offered him a job. <p> " I do n't know, it was just one of those deals, " Donnan said of such bravado. " But Barry liked that. The rest is just history. " <p> His story changed dramatically on Jan. 19, 1990, when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next 16 months, he lived in the Radisson Hotel in Huntington ; Mary and Todd were back in Norman so Todd could finish his senior year of high school. That arrangement illustrates two things : <p> How badly Donnan yearned to be a head coach. And how terribly he missed his family. <p> " I 'd never do that again, " said Donnan, who admits he would have turned down the Marshall job if he 'd realized how painful the separation anxiety would be. " Anybody who talks to me about making a commitment does n't know about a commitment until you 're away from everybody for 16 months. " <p> He lived on the ninth floor, in adjoining rooms 921 and 922. " We were even thinking about renaming it the Jim Donnan Suite because he stayed in it so long, " laughed Peggy Hensley, the hotel 's front office manager. Donnan endeared himself to the hotel staff, and not just because he was such an accommodating guest. <p> " If we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd tell us we could go ahead and sell that room for the night, " said Hensley. Donnan would tidy up one room and sleep in the other, or sometimes bunk on the couch in his office. <p> " There was nothing phony about him, " Hensley said. " Very honest, down-to-earth. He was bigger than life around here, but you would n't know it. He was down on everybody 's level. " <p> He big-timed no one. That only enhanced Donnan 's status in Huntington, where Marshall football is not only king, but sacred, too. It 's been so since football was revived after the horror of September, 1970, when the Marshall team plane crashed and 75 people - including 43 players and coaches - died. <p> Donnan understood Marshall, and Huntington. Each year, on the day after Thanksgiving, he rang the Salvation Army bell for an hour outside the Stone and Thomas department store on Third Avenue He was heavily involved in civic and charity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a first-name basis with the bellman, maids, food service people, everybody. The staff knew Donnan liked sweets and often worked deep into the night. So the night maid would stop in the gift shop to stock Donnan 's suite with cans of Dr. Pepper and Snickers bars, a little late- night sustenance. And the Radisson never served meatloaf at the weekly Marshall Quarterback Club luncheons each Thursdays. Coach hates meatloaf. <p> Nothing, though, could ease the ache in Donnan 's heart. Jim and Mary were hometown sweethearts in Burlington, N.C. They married right out of high school, before Jim enrolled at North Carolina State and eventually became an All-ACC quarterback in 1967. Two daughters, Tammy and Paige, soon were born. Years later, only Todd was still living at home when Jim went to Marshall. <p> Jim and Mary talked nightly by phone, but it was n't the same. And Jim desperately missed Todd 's games. During Donnan 's five years at Oklahoma, he saw every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through 11th grades. Now he had to follow Todd 's senior season long-distance. <p> " Friday nights, " Donnan said, " I could n't wait to call up and get the score, get the rundown. " Sometimes he could n't even wait that long. On the Marshall team bus ride home from a game at Western Carolina, Donnan used a cellular phone to call Rad Barrett, a neighbor back on Barry Switzer Avenue in Norman. Barrett was listening to Norman High 's Saturday night state playoff game on radio and kept giving Donnan updates, occasionally holding the phone up to the radio. <p> One problem : " We were driving through the mountains, " Donnan said, " and every 10 minutes or so, the phone would go out. " So Donnan re- dialed. The irony, of course, is that it was Todd who 'd ultimately persuaded his father to take the Marshall job. <p> " I do n't think he 'd have gone unless I 'd have told him, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family than anything. He did n't want to cause any strife. But he had this offensive system just waiting to be used. I said, ' You 've got to do it. Go up there and get some head coaching experience. You 're never going to know if you can do it or not. ' " <p> Besides, Todd knew this is what his father had strived for all his life. Why he 'd turned down a secure job in the textile industry for a chance to coach the N.C. State freshmen. Why Mary, watching the State- East Carolina freshman game in 1968, realized, " I saw Jim on the sidelines and how involved he was and how much he loved it. And I knew he had made the right decision. " <p> Why the family odyssey then wound through FSU, North Carolina, Kansas State, Missouri and Oklahoma before reaching West Virginia. Why it was so providential that Donnan worked in Chapel Hill from 1974-77 for Bill Dooley, serving as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubles partner in tennis. Why two months ago, when Bill 's big brother Vince began seeking Ray Goff 's successor( the first time), Bill could offer this recommendation : <p> " Good X-and-O man. Good recruiter. Good sense of humor. A good rapport with players and the ability to relate to alumni. And a competitor. " <p> The competitor part, Vince Dooley knew all about. Donnan was the MVP of the 1967 Liberty Bowl, when N.C. State beat Dooley and Georgia 14-7. Greg Williams knew it, too. <p> " Jim 's a great competitor, " said Williams, Donnan 's best friend in coaching, teammate in college and now his secondary coach. " And I like how he treats people. He treats people right. I do n't think he 's ever changed with how he treats people. I think that 's one reason why he 's won all these games and been so successful. " <p> Of even greater importance is the accumulated offensive wisdom and system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. A system Todd experienced as Marshall 's quarterback from 1991-94, the last two years as the starter. The discipline was evident two days before the ' 92 I-AA national championship game, when placekicker David Merrick overslept and missed practice. Donnan suspended him. That Saturday, Donnan held his breath when Merrick 's brother, Willy, a soccer player, kicked the first field goal of his life - a 22-yarder with 10 seconds left that beat Youngstown State 31-28 for the title. <p> Donnan would still be at Marshall had Mason not changed his mind. And Donnan could have lived with that - quite well, actually. He 's set financially, having invested wisely, and will continue to serve on the board of First Security Bank, a new bank in Huntington. " It broke our hearts when Jim left, " said Bill Allen, treasurer of Marshall 's Quarterback Club. " He always told me he was going to retire at 55. We were hoping he 'd stay here. But the Georgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " It was n't the financial aspect, " Donnan said. " Coach Dooley said I was making more( at Marshall) than Glen Mason. I had the best job on my level. It 's the security of a program with the chance to win year in, year out. I would 've never turned this job down. Taking it was a no- brainer, but leaving Huntington was the hard part. <p> " People ask me why I had that( farewell) press conference, " said Donnan, who left that press conference in tears. " It 's because the people of Huntington were so good to me. " <p> And how good will Donnan be for Georgia? Two scouting reports. <p> Stowers : " His teams are extremely talented. He has an exciting offensive package that 's easy to recruit to. They 'll run 100 different formations from a lot of different sets, but run a lot of the same plays. Run a few running plays and mix in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few screens, draws, some special plays. Defensively, they 're very simple but very, very sound. They 're always where they 're supposed to be when they 're supposed to be. Very physical, too. " <p> Todd Donnan, the ' 94 Southern Conference player of the year : " There 's nobody in America who 's had the balance we had. You never knew if we were going to throw for 400 yards or run for 250. We 'd do what we had to do to win. If teams were going to bring eight men up to stop the run, we would spread you out like the 49ers. If they were going to play the pass, we 'd run the toss sweep. We had 18,000 formations and basic stuff, too. A lot of stuff was done at the line of scrimmage. The routes are very similar to what Florida does. " <p> " To me, it 's not like you 're coming into a rebuilding situation here, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office. " This is a traditional powerhouse job. We have to reclaim the state in recruiting and become competitive in the contiguous states. And implement our system - offense, defense, kicking, academics. It 's kind of like a divorce ; a family 's split up and you 've got to mend fences. Our players have been very receptive. " <p> Asked to describe himself, Donnan replied, " I 'm a take-charge guy. I 've been a quarterback all my life. Do n't mind delegating responsibility, but I 'm a take-charge guy. " <p> That 's why he calls the plays, as well as the shots. And why, when Jim Donnan, his feet propped up on his new desk, leaned back and said evenly, not boastfully, " I feel comfortable in this chair, " you believed him. story) Jim Donnan / David Tulis / staff Photo : The major leagues : Jim Donnan looks over Sanford Stadium, his new stage as Georgia 's head football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim Donnan file -Age : 50.
