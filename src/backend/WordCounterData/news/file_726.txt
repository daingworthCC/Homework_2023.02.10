4194641 <h> Permit suspension will prevent the Virginia Beach SPCA from doing some of its valuable wildlife work <p> This box turtle appears to be thanking Denise Maples for carrying it across the road in Kempsville. <p> Two baby squirrels, rudely ousted from their nest in a wing wall of my house this winter by workmen re-siding the house, are fat and happy, back in the big wide world. <p> Thanks to caring wildlife rehabilitator Connie Hiebert with Second Chance Wildlife and other wildlife volunteers with the Virginia Beach Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, my little squirrels got a second chance to lead a squirrel 's life. <p> If you find injured or orphaned wildlife in distress, you continue to call the SPCA 's wildlife program at 757-263-4762, just like I did. <p> The good volunteers will answer your calls and your questions and refer you to a wildlife rehabilitator not on the SPCA premises. <p> The SPCA permit was suspended by the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries because a SPCA staff member missed the reporting deadline to tell the department that they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous pellets from a shotgun shell. <p> Now because of this reporting error, the SPCA has been disciplined and ca n't operate as a permitted wildlife rehabilitation facility until January 2018. The group is appealing the disciplinary action. <p> Last year, 2,600 wild critters were taken in at the SPCA and either helped there or transported to volunteer rehabbers in their homes, said Dia DuVernet, president and CEO at the SPCA. This year my baby squirrels were part of a 35 percent increase in wildlife at the SPCA over the same period in 2016. <p> Over the years I have written this column, I have depended on the SPCA as a group I could safely refer folks with wildlife issues to. I knew they were compassionate and knowledgable. <p> I hope game and inland fisheries sees fit to reduce the suspension. Not only did the SPCA make it possible for wild animals to get the quickest care possible, it also took the worry away from me and other worried folks like me. <p> Interestingly, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Game and Inland Fisheries to folks to watch out for turtles crossing the road this time of year. <p> So true. Late spring is a big season for roaming turtles. The other morning, I picked up a box turtle crossing my street and carried it to the other side. Denise Maples sent the photo above of a box turtle that she had carried across her road in Kempsville. Maples said maybe the turtle was smiling to thank her. <p> Turtles crossing the road this time of year are often females looking for a nice soft place, like your flower bed, to dig a hole and bury their eggs. And males might roam to look for a mate. <p> You can tell if a box turtle is female by her yellow-brown eyes and smooth bottom shell. Males have red-orange eyes and their bottom shells are concave. <p> Box turtles are land turtles but you also will see water turtles wandering up from lakes, ponds and ditches to look for the soft spots for their eggs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Always carry the turtles across the street in the direction they are heading, unless it is totally unsafe on the other side. Turtles are pretty territorial. They know where they are going and like to stay in their own neighborhood. <p> A snapping turtle, with its long neck, can reach round and bite you if you pick it up by its sides, so be careful with them. Other local turtles are harmless, but it 's best to just push snapping turtles across the road from behind. <p> This feels so ironic. Obviously the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries cares about wildlife or they would n't be writing about turtles crossing the road or many other wildlife topics on their website. <p> But it also feels like they are cutting off their nose to spite their face. Were a turtle to get run over here, the odds are it would have ended up at the SPCA. Now, where will it go? <h> Close Encounters <p> What surprises or puzzles have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of local lore? To reach Mary Reid Barrow, send e-mail to barrow1@cox.net.
