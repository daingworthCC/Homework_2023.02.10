3039041 <p> The biggest star on public television these days is n't Barney or Arthur but a 53-year-old New Age health guru named Gary Null. During the December pledge drive on public stations nationwide, his one-hour special, " How to Live Forever With Gary Null, " was a bonanza. <p> WETA-TV in Arlington, for instance, broadcast the show 13 times, drawing $ 234,465 in pledges while it aired, or almost one-third of the station 's total for the week. <p> Yet while many viewers appear to love Null 's admittedly " unorthodox " approach to health and well-being, public TV executives have mixed emotions. The program, said Linwood Lloyd, WETA 's chief operating officer, " does n't go over the line, but it comes right up to it.... It was very close to pseudo-science. " <p> In a medium known for such high-minded fare as " Nova, " " Masterpiece Theater " and " The News Hour With Jim Lehrer, " public TV executives across the country are expressing doubts about their stations ' growing dependence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " practitioner Deepak Chopra, personal-finance maven Suze Orman, alternative medicine advocate Andrew Weil and fitness counselor Covert Bailey. <p> At a time when public stations are scrambling for dollars, some worry that financial pressures may be driving stations to air what Steve Bass, president of station WDCN-TV in Nashville, describes as " everything from the cheesy... to the sleazy. " <p> " There are legitimate questions about the credibility of these shows, " said Fred Esplin, general manager of KUED-TV, the public station in Salt Lake City. " I know they work for some stations, but I do n't feel comfortable with them. " <p> Null said his shows have every right to be on the air, regardless of what the critics say. In an interview, he asked : " Did they ever consider that PBS means ' public broadcasting, ' and putting on what the public wants without some elitist-group bias or special-interest input? " <p> The debate among public broadcasters reflects a question as old as public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while also maintaining public TV 's historic " mission " of educating, enlightening and uplifting viewers? <p> The self-doubt surfaced in a free-ranging electronic-mail discussion among public TV officials last week, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post. The discussion 's title : " What Are We Doing to Ourselves? " <p> " Are the ' gurus of the month ' using our air to hawk snake oil, or are they cutting-edge, New Age thinkers leading the way into the next century? " wrote Ted Krichels of KBDI-TV in Denver. " Do we care as long as we get our cut? Given the convoluted economic base of our system, do we have the luxury of caring? " <p> Public Broadcasting Service President Ervin Duggan told the group in an e-mail message about hearing from a woman whose friend had stopped chemotherapy after watching Chopra discuss " spiritual healing " on a PBS program. <p> " Such travesties, " Duggan wrote, "... intensified my already intense concern that we lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our desire is to raise money.... What does it mean -- to our audience, to us -- if we adhere to such standards in one part of our schedule and abandon them in another? What does it profit us to honor science in ' Nova, ' only to open the door to quacks and charlatans " during pledge drives? <p> Duggan was unavailable for an interview, but his criticism strikes some station managers as misplaced. After all, his Alexandria-based PBS distributes to the nation 's 345 independently operated public TV stations some of the very shows that are under fire. <p> Most public stations remain financially dependent on pledge drives even though federal support for public broadcasting is increasing. The semi- or thrice-annual drives run by stations typically generate about one-third or more of the stations ' annual budgets, said Jeff Hankin, vice president of marketing at Maryland Public Television. To expand the pool of contributors, public stations often preempt their regular schedules during pledge drives and air programs designed to capture irregular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Alan Foster, defends programs such as Null 's, saying it is both popular and " pretty benign. " " He 's telling people to eat their vegetables and cut down on stress and sugar. It addresses a new topic in a new way. And it resonates with viewers, " he added. <p> The program, produced independently of PBS, features a lecture by Null interspersed with testimonials from several satisfied followers. Much of Null 's message is mainstream advice -- stop eating junk food, get more exercise -- but he goes beyond that, telling viewers that they can " de-age " and " reverse the aging process " by " detoxifying your negative emotions. " <p> " What if I told you that 70 years is half of what you should be living? " Null says at the start of his program. "... We have the knowledge to re-order the genetic sequencing within our bodies. " <p> Null is n't a medical doctor or a psychologist. In promotional material for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respected scholar, author, lecturer, environmentalist, scientist, investigative reporter, journalist and advocate of natural and alternative health practices. " He is " an adjunct associate professor of nutritional physiology and diplomat in the post-graduate nutritional program at the New York College of Chiropractic, " according to PBS. <p> Stephen Barrett, a retired psychiatrist who devotes his time to investigating dubious medical practices, said Null " promotes a number of unsubstantiated ideas and some that are clearly false. " In his books and tapes, Null advocates various " worthless " cancer therapies and discredited therapies such as " bio-magnetic healing, " Barrett said. <p> Responded Null in an interview, " I talk about what 's in mainstream science but not mainstream medicine. " <p> " I 've looked in orthodox science and there was the mother lode " of valuable information. " I am not advocating that people abandon their doctors. I am simply suggesting another approach. " <p> He notes his show 's popularity, and indeed, " How to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aired PBS programs during the December pledge drive. It was the top fund-raising program on both WETA and Maryland Public Television this month, PBS 's Foster said, judging by pledge calls placed while the show was on the air. The program drew $ 150,000 in pledges to Maryland Public Television, more than twice the second-best performing program, a documentary about Greek Americans. <p> Viewers who pledged at least $ 60 to WETA were eligible to receive Null 's latest book or audiotape. A videocassette, " How to Live Forever, " was available for a pledge of $ 75 and a package of the books and tapes went for $ 150. <p> The practice of tying pledges to books and tapes spun off from programs disturbs some people in public television. Although public stations have offered tote bags and other " premiums " to contributors for decades, station managers worry that they 're getting trapped into depending on offering products associated with a hot TV personality. <p> These only-during-pledge-week programs and products do n't build long-term viewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds that they create pressure on stations to air similar kinds of self-help programs during the next pledge drive. <p> What 's more, the people who tend to pledge to the station for these products tend not to be the station 's regular viewers, WETA 's Lloyd said. That means the station risks alienating its " core " viewers, he said. <p> Station officials acknowledge that their dilemma is one of their own making. And at the moment, they say they are n't quite sure what to do about it. " How to Live Forever With Gary Null " has been a fund-raising hit for WETA.
