3062241 <p> The lead sentence in the Sept. 6 story in the Sun-Times by R. Jeffrey Smith of the Washington Post on the Vatican 's declaration Dominus Iesus misrepresented the statement and has caused great difficulty for Catholics and others. Smith wrote, " A new Vatican declaration... says that only faithful Catholics can attain full salvation from earthly sins. " The declaration does n't say this. It is contrary to Catholic doctrine to believe it. <p> Since most people will not read the declaration, what a news story says about it becomes the declaration itself. The Sun-Times has done a great disservice to mutual understanding among religious groups by misrepresenting Catholic teaching. <p> Accurate reporting would have recognized the difference between subjective personal salvation and the objective availability of the means to salvation. In Catholic teaching, no one this side of heaven knows with absolute certainty who will live with God forever. The helps to eternal salvation are, however, made available here on Earth by any faith community that teaches about salvation. Some religions do not speak of salvation at all. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eternal son of God who became incarnate to save the entire human race. It says that, to accomplish the work of universal redemption, Jesus, after his resurrection, sent the Holy Spirit so that his disciples would be one body formed by sharing the spirit and other gifts from the Lord. It says that all these gifts of Christ are to be found in visible Catholic communion, and many of them, but not all, are found elsewhere. Many of these gifts would, in fact, not be claimed by Protestant Christians or considered means of salvation at all : the role of the blessed virgin Mary in the economy of salvation ; the seven sacraments of the apostolic Church, including Holy Orders and marriage as sacraments, and papal primacy. <p> All of this is straight Catholic teaching and has been for many years. The teaching was restated now because of current theological disputes, mostly in India and parts of Africa, about Christ 's acts of salvation in the lives of non-Christians and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand this context is to fail to understand the declaration. <p> In the United States, anti-Catholicism is part of the intellectual furniture and the cultural heritage of the nation. There is here, beyond purely personal prejudice, a principled and sincere opposition to Catholic teaching that can not be simply dismissed. <p> American Catholics therefore have to take objections to their faith seriously. Some objections are religiously based, especially opposition to the papal office. Some objections are politically or socially based, often on the conviction that religious pluralism protects political democracy. Some objections now are based on claims to sexual freedoms that run counter to the Catholic understanding of what it means to receive and transmit human life and on what Scripture and our own nature tell us about the family. <p> They deserve a serious hearing. Misrepresentation of church teaching does not. <p> Cardinal Francis George <p> Archbishop of Chicago <p> Wait till next century <p> I agree 100 percent with Rep. Jesse L. Jackson Jr.( D-Ill.) that the third airport needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The talk has gone on long enough. We all know that Mayor Daley does n't care about the south suburbs. Chicago is his only concern. <p> While the north, northwest and west suburbs continue to grow and prosper, the south suburbs continue to lose jobs, businesses and tax revenue -- not to mention population. We need the airport, jobs and businesses. <p> However, asking for a third airport is like asking the Cubs to make it to the World Series. Not in my lifetime! <p> John Walker, University Park <p> Careful what you seek <p> There are a few things Rep. Jesse L. Jackson Jr.( D-Ill.) failed to mention in his letter( " Let 's get third airport off the ground, " Aug. 27). Problems listed at O'Hare Airport occur at all airports. Poor service and overcrowded planes are the airlines ' problem. <p> Jackson has tried to blame O'Hare for delays caused by the weather. After extensive studies, experts determined all that is needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runway. Jackson 's list of the problems has nothing to do with why people are pushing this agenda, but everything to do with the big money they stand to gain when this monstrosity becomes a reality. <p> The Federal Aviation Administration needs to put people first. Include all who live in the south suburbs, whose lives never will be the same because of added pollution, noise and congestion. <p> There is a third airport in place -- in Gary, 15 minutes from downtown Chicago. <p> Hattie Wilburn, South Shore <p> Badges without merit <p> In the news story( " Scouts ' gay ban limiting funding, " Aug. 28), Rick Garcia again plays the discrimination/bigotry card, one rather flawed by now. Comparing the Boys Scouts to white supremacists is a stretch. No, it 's an insult. Discrimination against behavior( like smoking or drunkenness) is justified ; discrimination based on race or religion is not. <p> Since Garcia has introduced the notion of comparing, let 's carry it further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, by an incidence of intra-organization violence well over twice that of heterosexual domestic violence and by shouting " intolerance " to induce guilt in its most rational critics. <p> The moral : Folks who live in glass houses should not try cutting off the water supply of neighbors who ca n't invite them over. <p> John J. McCartney Jr., <p> Lower West Side <p> Veneration is on hold <p> You report that the Jews, Protestants and some Jesuits are against the beatification of Pope Pius IX( News Analysis, Aug. 28). You left out the Freemasons, who also are opposed. None of these has a vote in the matter. <p> Jews are opposed because in 1858, a Catholic servant of Edgardo Mortara secretly baptized their ill 6-year-old son, who later recovered. When she told Papal State authorities what she did, the boy was taken from his Jewish home and raised a Christian. Pius IX believed he was responsible for the boy 's Christian formation because of the baptism. The boy eventually became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conditions of 1858 do n't compute in 2000. The cause for beatification began in 1907. It languished. In 1954, Pius XII re-initiated the cause. In 1985, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints said Pius IX " heroically exercised the theological and cardinal virtues. " <p> When Pope John Paul II was a young priest, a woman who promised to take care of a Jewish child when his parents were captured by Nazis asked him -- then known as the Rev. Karol Wojtyla -- to baptize him when the war ended, since his parents were presumed killed. He refused. Eventually, the family was reunited. <p> The objections are incidental, not " core. " What is core is that sanctity is a mystery, not a category of political correctness. <p> Thaddeus J. Kochanny, <p> Ingleside <p> Selling out history <p> Shame on Chicago. Gutting the 1912 Medinah Temple for a glam national furniture store chain outlet is not " preserving a beloved bit of Chicago history, " as city planners tout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can visualize after 20 years of work and research on the issue? <p> Medinah is a renowned 4,200-seat auditorium. It and the neighboring Tree Studios are not disposable landmark facades to be filled with the tawdry commercial ideas of a favored developer. <p> This city preservation plan smacks of suburban mentalities, is not preservation and, overall, is a poor excuse for a renovation plan. <p> James A. Pierce, Rogers Park <p> If it ai n't broke... <p> What an accurate description of the accomplishments of the Democratic presidents since Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the negative effects of Republicans on the country( Letters, Aug. 25). <p> We would do well to keep these facts in mind when we go to the polls in November. We are enjoying prosperity, a joie de vivre and a general atmosphere of confidence and hope for the future. History indicates that Democrats ' promises are not merely political rhetoric and they do what they promise to do -- unless of course, a Republican Congress makes life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright economy and employment for most, we must elect a team who really cares about the people. Democrats do. <p> Eunice Cohen, Niles <p> Without redemption <p> People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has erected a billboard of New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, parodying the " Got Milk? " advertising campaign. The billboard shows Giuliani with a milk mustache and asks : " Got prostate cancer? " <p> Giuliani, like someone dear to me, is one of the millions of victims of prostate cancer -- a terrifying, killer disease. The billboard is not only in poor taste and unfunny, it is cruel and disrespectful. But I am not interested in taking offense. <p> Rather, I am heartened because this act finally may unmask PETA so completely that most Americans will see it for what it is : a radical, anti-social cabal of agitators who attempt to elevate the value of animal life while devaluing human life. <p> Anthony Louis Troyke, Berwyn <p> Wrong demographics <p> What 's all the hoopla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You get paid and afterward there is plenty of promotional money to be made. A win-win situation. <p> Why not give a million dollars to the urban street people who survive brutal conditions every day? These people survive all types of weather. Sleep in alleys with city rats. Eat from Dumpsters. Wash when they can in water fountains. <p> Where is the money and fame for these real survivors? <p> Al Baldassano, Northlake
