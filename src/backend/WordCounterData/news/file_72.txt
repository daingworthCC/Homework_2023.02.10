3014141 <p> A judge has assessed $$210,000 in punitive damages against two men who failed to convince a jury that their employer ordered them to perform hundreds of illegal wiretaps. <p> Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Fred J. Cartolano ordered the assessments Monday against former Cincinnati Bell Telephone Co. employees Leonard Gates and Robert Draise. <p> " You have to be punished, " Cartolano said. " I do n't think you two have that much in assets, but I think you should be made an example for others. " <p> A jury found that Gates and Draise had defamed Cincinnati Bell, its parent company Cincinnati Bell Inc., and company supervisors with their wiretap claims. Jurors awarded $$110,000 in compensatory damages, and said the judge should add punitive damages because Gates and Draise recklessly disregarded the truth in their accusations. <p> After the jury announced its verdict on Jan. 23, Cartolano said he, too, had concluded that Gates and Draise lied. <p> Cartolano said the law allows him to use punitive damages as both a punishment and as a deterrent. Although he acknowledged that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not my job to collect the damages. " <p> Gates and Draise testified Monday that they are out of work, deeply in debt, and have only a few hundred dollars in available cash. During their eight-week trial they represented themselves because they said they could not afford lawyers. <p> The two men claimed they wiretapped more than 1,200 telephones between the early 1970s and 1984 on orders from Cincinnati police and Bell security supervisors James West and Peter Gabor. <p> They claimed the taps were placed on the phones of various community leaders, reporters, criminal suspects, a federal judge and President Ford during a 1975 visit. <p> Several past and present police officers admitted using the two men for about a dozen illegal taps in the early 1970s. <p> But the police said Bell supervisors were not involved. Bell, West and Gabor denied any knowledge or participation in such activities. <p> Phone company lawyers contended the two men were seeking revenge because Bell fired Draise in 1979 and Gates in 1986. <p> Bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge 's ruling, and that the fact that damages were assessed was more important than the dollar amounts. <p> Gates and Draise stuck by their stories and said they are raising money to pay for an appeal. <p> " We are not surprised at anything.... The public knows the wiretapping happened, " Gates said. <p> Several alleged victims of wiretapping are suing police and the city of Cincinnati. The case is scheduled to go to trial Feb. 20 in U.S. District Court.
