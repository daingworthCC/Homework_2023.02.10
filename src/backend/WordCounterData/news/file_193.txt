3038841 <p> Over the last three months, Chinese officials have labeled Lee Teng-hui duplicitous, a source of instability, a closet dictator, perverse, dangerous, unpopular, a U.S. puppet and a traitor to China who was driving his people to the abyss. <p> Now they can use another label for him : freely elected president of Taiwan. <p> The election that Lee won Saturday with 54 percent of the vote poses a vexing problem for Communist leaders in Beijing. They can continue to vilify Lee, thus heightening confrontation and delaying progress toward reunification with Taiwan. Or they can swallow some pride and reach out to Lee, realizing that he has Taiwan 's destiny in his hands for the next four years. <p> Either path carries risks, especially for a Chinese leadership that itself may not be united on this question. And much depends on the course that Lee pursues. Either way, it will be a delicate exercise in diplomacy with the peace and prosperity of Asia at stake -- and a test for those taking over the leadership from aging Chinese patriarch Deng Xiaoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrouded in mystery. The major players are the seven-man Standing Committee of the Communist Party, leaders of the People 's Liberation Army, the foreign policy establishment and hard-line nationalists and ideologues who might want to use the Taiwan issue to gain greater power. <p> Longtime China watchers and Chinese political analysts believe Beijing has three options. <p> Scenario One : Reconciliation. <p> In this scenario, China finishes its military exercises on Monday, declares that the exercises made their point, tones down its attacks on Lee, renews low-level and mid-level contacts across the Taiwan Strait and continues to embrace Taiwanese investors in China. <p> In return, Beijing would expect Taiwan to accept China 's proposal to establish " three links " -- direct communication, direct flights and direct shipping -- and to quietly put its drive for international recognition on hold. <p> " Lee Teng-hui 's election is an opportunity to cool off tensions, " said a Chinese political analyst well-connected in the Chinese government and military. <p> There are good reasons for China to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been impassioned, so is its rhetoric about maintaining domestic stability. Confrontation across the Taiwan Strait damages China 's economy and thus its stability. Taiwan is the second biggest foreign investor in China. Even partial U.S. sanctions could choke off billions of dollars of exports by Chinese companies, throwing people out of work and causing a ripple effect from coastal boom towns to the rural areas that rely on remittances from migrant workers. <p> " Deng Xiaoping once said China would be willing to sacrifice 20 years of development to prevent Taiwan 's independence, " the political analyst said. " Nobody is willing to say that today. The Chinese government thinks in the next 15 years it will solve a lot of problems and... it does n't want a major international incident to upset its development strategy. " <p> Moreover, although China claimed today that intimidation tactics weakened support for Peng Ming-min, the Taiwanese pro-independence candidate, some of the leadership may contend that the strategy has been a failure, alienating Taiwanese, irritating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asian arms race. <p> China wants the foundation for reconciliation to be President Jiang Zemin 's eight-point plan of January 1995, in which he advocated a " one country, two system " arrangement similar to Hong Kong 's and declared that " Chinese should not fight fellow Chinese. " <p> Foreign Minister Qian Qichen declared last week that Jiang 's speech still represents government policy. And the official New China News Agency over the weekend quoted Deng 's position from the early 1980s suggesting that Taiwan might retain its own military forces after reunification. Short of independence, everything is negotiable, Foreign Ministry officials have said. <p> After campaigning against Chinese intimidation, it would be politically impossible for Lee openly to abandon efforts to gain international recognition. But apparently Beijing does n't expect him to do so. It says it does n't believe what he says anyway, so he can speak with " deeds " instead and quietly put his international campaign on a back burner. <p> " Beijing does not want Lee to do anything. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles W. Freeman Jr., former U.S. assistant secretary of defense. " Beijing will then match Taipei 's restraint with its own. No political provocations from Taipei will translate into no military provocations from Beijing. " <p> Scenario Two : Continued tension, but no armed conflict. <p> After vilifying Lee and blasting the United States for interference, it will be tough for Beijing to climb down gracefully from its confrontational position -- especially with U.S. warships in the vicinity. Many hard-liners also will argue that China should keep pressure up until the U.S. flotilla leaves, so the United States appears to give way first. <p> " I would be very surprised if Beijing tried reconciliation. Big countries are slow to anger and slow to calm down, " said Brantly Womack, political science professor at the University of Virginia. " Having committed themselves to a more confrontational posture, they are n't likely to back down. " <p> Moreover, if Chinese policy makers really believe the official interpretation of the election results -- that missiles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the threats might continue. The next step could be harassment of Taiwanese fishermen in the Taiwan Strait. <p> Intimidation is a way for Beijing to erode Lee 's stature, as it has done with the British governor in Hong Kong. And it is a way of communicating directly with the Taiwanese. " Government-to-government relations have been ineffective, " said the Chinese analyst. " So Beijing wants to work on the Taiwanese electorate. " At the same time, Beijing might not ratchet up tensions further. <p> " There 's nobody in the collective leadership willing to escalate the crisis into a conflict, " the analyst added. " If there were a single paramount leader, it would be more difficult to predict, but with collective leadership nobody will want to take that responsibility. " <p> Scenario Three : Conflict. <p> Are China and Taiwan on a collision course? No matter how reasonable it might seem for both sides to cool tensions, it may be impossible to reconcile Taiwan 's yearning for independence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I am pessimistic and afraid that some sort of overt conflict is quite likely, " said Huang Yasheng, professor at the University of Michigan. " This whole issue of increasing Taiwan 's diplomatic space is going to be a long-run trend. Whatever concessions Lee is going to make are tactical and do not reflect a fundamental change in direction. Taiwan is a democracy now, and there is a structural demand for more international recognition. " <p> China 's missile diplomacy has left little room for maneuvering in Beijing or Taipei. It " deprives Lee of a political option to back down, " Huang said. " No leader can back down under this kind of political pressure even if he wants to. " <p> The chances of conflict could rise if Lee, comforted by the U.S. show of naval force and U.S. congressional resolutions, pushes even harder for diplomatic recognition for Taiwan -- including high-level visits abroad and a campaign for a U.N. seat. <p> China has left itself few options if Lee pursues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " By choosing to play your game to such a high-stakes level of brinkmanship, you exhaust your options very quickly other than going to an actual war, " Huang said. " What if Lee does not back down and yet he does not go for formal independence? By not pursuing a more measured response, you have deprived yourself of the option of gradually escalating pressures on Lee. " <p> Freeman argues that China wo n't do anything precipitous given its military limitations. If Lee presses the limits of Beijing 's patience, " the Chinese army will then argue for and get the budget for a long-term buildup to be able to take Taiwan by force around 2006, " he said. <p> David Shambaugh, editor of the China Quarterly, argues that Beijing could act sooner, perhaps using missiles to blockade Taiwanese ports and bring the self-governing island to heel regardless of the political and economic consequences. <p> Taiwan, which relies heavily on trade and imports 600,000 barrels of oil a day, would be vulnerable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't empty, Shambaugh argues. He also sees the Chinese leadership as shut off from reality. The Taiwan Strait crisis could follow the pattern of other Chinese wars of words -- with India, Russia and Vietnam -- that became shooting wars. <p> " This is one big myth of self-delusion, " Shambaugh said. " It goes right to the core of the myth of their revolution : standing up to the West and gunboat diplomacy.... They 're drunk with their own myth. "
