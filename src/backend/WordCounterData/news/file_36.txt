3005341 <p> DYLAN SPROUSE slid his Sidekick out of his pocket to eye an incoming e-mail message, typed a few keys under the table and then returned his focus to a meeting with his twin brother, Cole, their manager, their publicist and two executives from their licensing company. <p> " I want Code magazine not to be placed anywhere near Popstar, Tigerbeat or M, " Dylan said of the magazine for teenage boys the twins are starting up in July. " We want it near Nintendo Power or Mad. " <p> Cole nodded as he looked over a mock-up cover featuring a skateboarder. " More toward sport and surfing magazines, not fan magazines, " he said. <p> Diane Reichenberger, the chief executive of the Dualstar Entertainment Group, which has a licensing agreement with the boys, assured Dylan and Cole, who will be Code 's editors, that it will be shelved near gaming, tech and gear magazines. <p> " Also, " Cole began, " I was thinking, ' trends '? It kind of seems like it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand manager for this project, nodded as she took notes. " That 's a good point, " she said, adding that she had just sent an e-mail message to Leisure Publishing, a partner on the magazine, banning the use of the word trends altogether. <p> " You 're right, " Ms. Reichenberger said. " You 're right on, Cole. " <p> Then it was time to talk video podcasts. Dylan had an idea : " How about this? I like this idea. We get a major league pitcher, O.K.? And we say : ' The perfect way to throw an egg. ' " <p> Ms. Reichenberger let out a laugh. " I love that. " <p> Ms. Jung muttered aloud as she jotted down notes : " The perfect way to throw an egg. " <p> Unless you live in the vicinity of 6- to 14-year-olds, you might not be familiar with Dylan and Cole Sprouse, the 13-year-old twin stars of " The Suite Life of Zack and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its second season, the show became the network 's top-rated hit in January when it went from a weekend to a daily series, and the Sprouse brothers went from playing forgettable kids in adult movies to ' tween heartthrobs, the subject of exclamation point-laden posts on fan Web sites and a mainstay of magazines for girls like Bop and Tigerbeat. <p> Now with the help of Dualstar, the entertainment company that grew up around Mary-Kate Olsen and her twin sister Ashley Olsen( who are now co-presidents), Dylan and Cole hope to mold themselves in the image of the elder twins and grow from mere heartthrobs into something more lasting : a brand. <p> The coming months will bring an avalanche of things Sprouse. In addition to the computer wallpaper, buddy icons and iron-on transfers of their logo, which have been available since February from the SprouseBros.com Web site, posters will be released tomorrow, followed by calendars, ring tones and video podcasts. This will all lead up to the start-up of their quarterly lifestyle magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 at Planet Hollywood in New York. It will cost $3.99. <p> DVD 's and books are in the works as well, not to mention a Sprouse Bros. hair gel, hair wax, deodorant sticks and sprays, a cologne and a three-in-one body wash, shampoo and conditioner, bound for shelves before the end of the year. Finally, a full line of sportswear will come out in stores -- to be determined -- next spring. <p> " I 've been looking at Mary-Kate and Ashley and what they 've created as the model, " said Josh Werkman, who has been managing the boys since they were 8 and who pitched them to Dualstar. The goal, he said, is to not stop with television and movies but " to take this to another level. " <p> But it is going to take more than ring tones and a logo to catch the Olsens ' wave. First and foremost, as the deodorant suggests, the Sprouses are hoping to sell to boys. While postings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way 2 pluto and bac " and " Soooooo married 2 Dylan Sprouse ") suggest that the brothers could sell dental equipment to 10-year-old girls, it 's unclear whether boys can be convinced to spend, say, $20, for a bottle of Sprouse Bros. cologne. <p> As Marshal Cohen, chief analyst at the NPD Group, a market research firm, and the author of " Why Customers Do What They Do, " explained, developing a line of apparel and grooming products aimed at boys under 14, " does n't come without great risk and challenges. " What 's going to happen with these guys three years from now? " Mr. Cohen asked, adding that not only will the twins be growing up, but boys in general are a harder sell than girls for such products. According to NPD Group research, boys 8 to 17 spend about $12.5 million on clothes while girls in the same age bracket spend almost $21 million. <p> Still, he added, boys are evolving as consumers, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure there are major differences between boys and girls, but that gap is shrinking big time, " he said. <p> Founded in 1993 when the Olsen girls were only 6 to produce a series of direct-to-video titles, Dualstar became a pioneer in the ' tween market when it expanded to include books, music, video games, dolls, cosmetics, furniture and clothes. Forbes magazine estimated that sales were around $1.4 billion in 2003 ; Fortune estimated that Ashley and Mary-Kate are worth about $137 million each. <p> When the twins took full ownership of the company about a year ago, one of their first moves was to hire Ms. Reichenberger, a marketing and merchandizing veteran of companies like L.A. Gear, Joe Boxer and the Gap, with the idea that she could help expand the company beyond Mary-kateandashley. There is no way to know if the Sprouse brothers will wield anything like the commercial might of the Olsens, but Ms. Reichenberger has high hopes. She said that months of meetings with Dylan, Cole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> " There has to be a spark or something special there to go out and sell it and have all of us to believe in it, " she said. " You want to see whatever we 're doing to be the best thing for them, for all of us really, but specifically for them because it represents who they are and they are so young. " <p> Dualstar wo n't divulge how much it has invested in the Sprouse brand, but Ms. Reichenberger said Cole and Dylan 's products are a natural expansion of the Olsen sisters ' lines of clothing, beauty products and housewares for girls without competing with them. <p> " There are always those people who have a lot of naysaying to do, " Ms. Reichenberger said of people who do n't think that boys will want to buy clothes or grooming products. " They did n't see how it would make sense to sell clothes to little girls, either. " <p> Still, she said, Dylan and Cole will play an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Olsens do. The Sprouses will act more as advisers and tastemakers than the faces of the brand. <p> " Girls will want to emulate a celebrity, " Ms. Reichenberger said. " Little girls look at Mary-Kate and Ashley, they want to dress like them. Whereas boys are not like ' I want to look like Dylan and Cole. ' The distinction is that it 's more about relating to the boys : what Dylan and Cole love, we 're creating for other boys. " <p> Or as Cole put it : " Our priorities right now are about appealing to people who are our age and boys. We do n't want anything too girlie. " <p> LIKE Mary-Kate Olsen and Ashley Olsen, Dylan and Cole have been in front of the camera since they were infants and speak with the maturity of child stars who have spent a lot of time around adults. <p> After the Dualstar meeting, overa dinner of chicken pizza at the Terrace Cafe in Marina del Ray, Calif., Dylan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his real name for a man seeking an autograph for his 9-year-old daughter. " Just in case a father like you brings it home and your daughter or son are like, what 's that? " he explained. <p> Later, fidgeting with his Sidekick, he said : " It is kind of scary, how fast everything is moving. Just a year ago none of this was happening, it was just doing ' Suite Life, ' and now I ca n't wait for what 's in store because that 's what gets me up in the morning. " The boys ' parents, Melanie Wright and Matthew Sprouse, while supportive, leave their day-to-day business affairs to their professional team. The couple, now divorced, moved to Los Angeles soon after the boys were born. Before they were a year old, the twins were splitting the role of Brett Butler 's baby in " Grace Under Fire. " <p> Their next break came when they were 6 and cast as Julian, the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " It was at that point that Mr. Werkman entered their lives. After seeing " Big Daddy, " he pursued them as clients and ultimately left his agency to work with them exclusively. It was he who sought out the deal with Disney. " We wanted something really cutting edge, " Mr. Werkman said, " not the typical Disney show with the bookend parents. " He said he rejected a script of that kind before he agreed to " The Suite Life of Zack and Cody. " <p> The show suits them. Dylan, who is laid back in real life, plays the troublemaker who can let the clutter in his room become hazardous. Cole, who characteristically keeps to a schedule, plays the more cautious Cody, who can be almost too organized. <p> The program, which is half " Eloise at the Plaza, " half " The Odd Couple, " centers around the twins and their single mother, the cabaret performer at the Tipton Hotel, a stuffy overdecorated establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The standard plot has Zack, played by Dylan, embarking on some mission that is bound to get them in trouble and Cody advising caution but nevertheless being dragged along. <p> " There is the inciter and the reluctant participant, like Lucy and Ethel, the two of them are in on it together, " said Rich Ross, the president of the Disney Channel Worldwide. " They have a fearlessness, that ventures toward the comedic. " <p> One thing on the brothers ' mind, however, is how long to exploit such togetherness. <p> " One of the pieces of advice that Mary-Kate and Ashley have given me and the boys, " Mr. Werkman said, " was that they wished they had started a little earlier " doing individual projects. <p> The twins say the Olsens have become mentors. " Mary-Kate is exactly like Cole and Ashley is exactly like me, " Dylan said. <p> Cole nodded. " It is so weird. " <p> For now, though, after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future of the Sprouse brand on their minds as they start fiddling with sugar packets after their pizza and chicken fingers. " We want to reach out to the nerd group and the cool group, and the surfers and the skaters, " Dylan added. " There should be something that will appeal to everybody. " <p> The jury of their peers is out on that. <p> " I actually like the clothes that they wear, " said Mathieu Bialosky, 8, who lives in New York and watches " Suite Life. " " Especially the jackets. And I like their long hair because I 'd like to have hair like that. " <p> Sam Kay, also 8, was more skeptical, saying that although he loves the show he would wear Dylan and Cole clothes " only if I 've seen other kids wear it.
