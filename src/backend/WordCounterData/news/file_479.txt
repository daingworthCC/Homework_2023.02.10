4085941 ATHENS # Greg McGarity, Georgia 's athletic director, was 14 years old when he went to his first Georgia-Florida football game in Jacksonville. He tagged along with his father, who was in charge of selling the game programs on that rainy day in 1968. Georgia won 51-0. # McGarity has tended to be on the winning side of this storied rivalry ever since. # When he was a student at UGA in the 1970s, the Bulldogs won four of five games against the Gators. When he worked on the UGA athletics staff from 1977 to 1991, the Dogs won 10 of 15. Then he switched sides in 1992, going to work for Florida, and the Gators won 15 of the next 18. # So the record of McGarity 's team in this series since he enrolled at UGA in the fall of 1972 is... 29-9. # " I 've been fortunate. I 've been on the right side, " McGarity, 56, said this week. " It 's not anything I 've done. It 's just that I 'm along for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August when Georgia hired him to run its athletic department. Whether that signals another change in the trend remains to be seen. The teams meet Saturday in Jacksonville. # One thing is certain : The game has been important in McGarity 's life. # Friend of Foley # As a young Georgia staffer in the 1980s, he was the school 's administrative point person on the game ; his counterpart at Florida was Jeremy Foley. They got to know each other well, often going out to dinner after meetings in Jacksonville. When Foley became Florida 's athletic director in 1992, he quickly hired McGarity, who moved from Athens for the first time. # No matter which side of the field he has been on, McGarity loves the Georgia-Florida game and loves playing it in Jacksonville with the tickets split evenly between the schools. # " The city does a great job of not showing favoritism, " he said. " You 've got a truly neutral game that I think is one of the few traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now you 've got a Super Bowl-quality stadium ; you 've got staff that is trained in customer service ; you 've got an atmosphere that is second to none. " # The long-term contract negotiated with Jacksonville last year will serve Georgia well, said McGarity, who was on the Florida side of the table when the deal was done. " It takes away all the arguments that, ' Well, it 's so far for Georgia to travel, " he said. The contract, which runs through 2016, stipulates that Jacksonville will pay for three private planes to fly the Bulldogs directly from the Athens airport. # " Now we 're probably going to be in our hotel quicker than Florida will be in theirs by busing over through traffic, " McGarity said. " So you remove that excuse. " # Although Georgia leads Florida 47-39-2 in the series, including 40-37-1 in Jacksonville, the Bulldogs have lost 17 of the past 20 meetings and seven of nine under coach Mark Richt. As one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn again. But he does n't think obsessing over it will help -- - a point he made to Georgia 's coaches in all sports shortly after arriving as AD. # " One of the first things we talked about as a staff here was what I called a ' Florida fixation, " he said. " I thought it was important that every coach know that from the athletic director 's chair, every game is just as important as another game. I knew there was an underlying thread here that there was a sort of mandate to beat Florida, and I thought it was extremely unhealthy. I wanted to dispel that Day 1. # " Because I could n't understand why it was more important to beat Florida than it was to beat South Carolina, Tennessee and anybody else in the SEC East.... That does n't diminish our desire to win against Florida, but I think if you put too much pressure on that, it translates into players being tight and coaches being tight. Coaches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They know the deal. " # Georgia last beat Florida in 2007, a game in which the Bulldogs famously stormed the field and danced in the end zone after their first touchdown. McGarity does n't remember that incident fondly. He said it " did nothing to really enhance the rivalry " and " to me went right against the spirit of the game. " # Likes Richt 's leadership # Three years later, the Bulldogs arrive at the first Georgia-Florida game of the McGarity administration with a 4-4( 3-3 SEC) record, which includes a four-game losing streak and, now, a three-game winning streak. McGarity said there was concern when the losing streak reached four at Colorado on Oct. 2 that, " Boy, which way are we going? " But he was encouraged by a chat with Richt two days later. # " Monday morning after the Colorado game, we were talking in this office here, and he said, ' I 'm changing some things, " McGarity recalled. " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " # Richt ordered a full-pads, full-contact practice that afternoon -- - the first time he had done so on a Monday following a game in 10 years -- - and has held more physical practices since. # " I went to that Monday practice, " McGarity said, " and the energy level was like we were 5-0. That practice, without question, I think, was the turning point in the success we 've had thus far. And remember, we 're still 4-4. There 's still a long way to go. And who knows what 's going to happen? " # Whatever happens, McGarity was impressed by Richt 's willingness to change in midstream and to acknowledge he had erred in his approach to preparing the team. # " I think for someone to admit that publicly and say, ' I 'm making some changes, that to me is a sign of strong leadership, " McGarity said. # McGarity, who had never met Richt before becoming his boss, has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very dedicated person to making this program the best it can possibly be, " McGarity said. " He is so genuine, and I just think he 's a wonderful person. " # McGarity is taking the same position at 4-4, though, that he took at 1-4 when it comes to questions about Richt 's future. # " I would just say that we 're focused so much on this year right here. I do n't want the focus to be off this year, " he said. " We have n't even had time to think about the future. We 're just focused on right now -- - what can we do to help the team achieve the dreams that are still out there? " # McGarity will be on the Georgia side of the stadium for the first time since 1991. He is n't sure how emotional the transition will be, particularly when he sees Foley and other friends from his 18 years at Florida, but he well remembers what it was like when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win. " I was a basket case for that game, " he said. # Next for Georgia # Who : vs. Florida
