4191641 <p> NEW YORK -- San Francisco Giants manager Bruce Bochy sat behind his desk late Wednesday evening, soaked with champagne, chatting with vice president Brian Sabean, trying to make sense what they just witnessed. <p> " You try to come up with the right words, ' ' Bochy told USA TODAY Sports, " but there are n't any. This is the best postseason game I 've ever been part of. It 's almost like you 're watching history, only you 're living it. <p> " I mean, this guy may be the greatest postseason pitcher we 've ever seen. ' ' <p> They are talking about Giants ace Madison Bumgarner, who just shut out the New York Mets, 3-0, pitching a four-hit complete game in the National League wild card game at Citi Field, displaying the latest chapter of his postseason mastery. <p> This is a pitcher who is re-writing the record book. <p> He has now gone 23 consecutive innings in the postseason without giving up a run. <p> He is yielding a 0.79 ERA in his last nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In his last eight postseason road games, he is 8-0 with a 0.50 ERA, and has yet to give up a hit with a runner in scoring position in 24 at-bats. <p> He has three career postseason shutouts, one shy of the record set by Giants Hall of Famer Christy Matheson a century ago. <p> He has made six postseason starts without permitting a run, tying Hall of Famer Tom Glavine for the highest total in baseball history. <p> And, he has the lowest ERA, 1.94, of any starter with at least 12 postseason starts. <p> " He 's not only the greatest, ' ' Sabean says, " but I 'm not sure it 's even close. ' ' <p> No wonder when Giants president Larry Baer was asked about Bumgarner 's exploits, Baer says it may be time to do something a little unconventional. <p> " The rule is that we do n't build statues until they 're retired, ' ' Baer said, " we may break a rule. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' <p> Hey, why not? <p> Bumgarner has now helped them win three World Series championships in six years, almost singlehandedly winning it for them in 2014 with his legendary postseason. <p> And now, he looms as the biggest threat to ruining the Chicago Cubs ' World Series dreams. <p> The Giants will take on the Cubs in the best-of-five division series beginning Friday night at Wrigley Field, and considering they have now won nine consecutive elimination games, and nine consecutive postseason series plus two wild-card games - tying the 1998-2001 New York Yankees for the longest streak in history - how can anyone shake their confidence? <p> The Giants, even with Mets starter Noah Syndergaard pitching his heart out for seven shutout innings, never panicked. It may have felt like a remake of Jack Morris and John Smoltz in Game 7 of the 1991 World Series, but as Giants pitcher Jake Peavy said, never once did they feel they would lose. <p> " It really was n't that exciting, it was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " You 're almost numb about it. He just does n't make mistakes. <p> " Some people are born to be painters. <p> " Bum was born to pitch. ' ' <p> The way Bumgarner was cruising, the Giants ' most stressful moment of the night was immediately after Conor Gillaspie 's three-run homer run in the ninth inning off Mets closer Jeurys Familia. Bochy, preparing in case Gillaspie made an out, had sent Jarrett Parker to the on-deck circle. <p> When Gillaspie crossed the plate, Bochy noticed that Parker was standing right there, and screamed at him to get back, panicking that Parker would be inserted into the game. <p> " I 'll be honest, I was a little nervous because Parker was there in the batter 's box high-fiving him, ' ' Bochy said. " I 'm screaming to get him out of there. I thought the umpire was going to put him in the game. I need Bum to stay in there. The last thing I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitching. ' ' <p> Bumgarner stayed in, pitching a 1-2-3 ninth inning, silencing the sellout crowd of 44,747 at Citi Field, who just witnessed a piece of history, with Bumgarner now having pitched 27 scoreless innings with his team facing elimination. <p> The Giants, who have run the table the last three times they entered the playoffs, suddenly are an awfully dangerous threat to the Cubs. <p> " I know how good they are, ' ' Bochy says, " but you just want a shot. That 's all we wanted. And now we got it. ' ' <p> And, oh yeah, they 'll still have Bumgarner in Game 3, and even in relief if needed in Game 5. <p> The last time Bumgarner has n't had success, you 've got to go back to Oct. 6, 2014, when they lost to the Washington Nationals, 4-1. Bumgarner still went seven innings, and gave up just two earned runs, but he still got the loss. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thinks about it, as part of the Nationals. Now, he and everyone else in the clubhouse, ca n't help but wonder if he 'll ever lose again. <p> " If I had to choose one pitcher out of the whole entire Major League Baseball to go into a deciding game, ' ' Span said, " it would definitely be him. He epitomizes this team. ' '
