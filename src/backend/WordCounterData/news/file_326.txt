3055441 <p> Just when you figure every gimmick for every conceivable goofy format has been exhausted, along comes another golf tournament all dressed up to promote itself as some sort of more important, more lucrative competition without which golf simply can not survive. <p> As usual, however, this one is no different than any of the other tournaments in golf 's unofficial season. The primary purpose of Tiger Woods ' new golf tournament is to ensure that the rich keep getting richer. <p> In that endeavor, it will not fail. <p> The PGA Tour announced last week that the Williams World Challenge will be unveiled as an unofficial event over the New Year 's holiday in Scottsdale, Ariz. It 's in conjunction with the Tiger Woods Foundation, which will be the principal charity benefited by the tournament. <p> The 72-hole stroke-play tournament will have only 12 competitors. Not surprisingly, they are the top 10 members of the Official World Golf Rankings and two players selected by the foundation 's board. <p> That means Woods gets to pick two of his good friends if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among ratings-grabber Sergio Garcia, Phoenix hero Phil Mickelson( who also is a close ally of Woods on golf issues) and Tim Herron. Why Herron? Because Target is the presenting sponsor of Tiger 's new tournament and Herron is Target 's primary endorser on tour. <p> Anyway, the idea behind the tournament is to help celebrate the millennium golf-style. The event will start with rounds on Dec. 29 and 30, with a pro-am on New Year 's Eve, and the final two rounds on NBC on Jan. 1 and 2, which conveniently fall on a Saturday and Sunday. <p> The purse? It 's $ 3.5 million, meaning last place earns $ 120,000 with the winner getting $ 1 million. <p> That 's $ 3.5 million for 12 players, or an average of nearly $ 300,000 per entrant. That 's far more than the Tour Championship, which has $ 5 million for 30 players( $ 166,667 per player), which has the next-biggest purse per capita on tour. <p> It appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing was mentioned in the original announcement about a long-term deal, Earl Woods, Tiger 's father and president of the Tiger Woods Foundation, said Grayhawk Golf Club and the Williams Cos. have agreed to a three-year partnership for the tournament. <p> However, the stars would seem to have fallen into perfect alignment this year. In 2001, when Jan. 1 is a Monday, making a tournament like this happen wo n't be nearly as easy, considering players will have to be in Hawaii on Tuesday night, immediately after the Woods tournament would be ending. <p> Nevertheless, the Williams World Challenge looks like it 's going to be part of golf 's elite players ' schedule for the foreseeable future. It 's amazing how 12 guys who barely play 20 events on the regular tour will show up in their underwear at midnight when they know they 're guaranteed big money. <p> The most uplifting part of this new tournament is that it will raise a considerable amount for charity in Phoenix, where a First Tee project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events there generally raise as much money as anybody in the country, or more. <p> But would n't it be nice if for once - just once - the top players in golf played a tournament like this and turned the bulk of the revenue over to the charities, instead of the other way around? <p> You do n't say <p> - Ben Crenshaw is completely focused on leading the U.S. Ryder Cup team to victory next week at The Country Club. <p> But when it comes to his playing ability, he harbors no delusions of grandeur. In fact, he 's glad there 's no tiebreaker in Ryder competition that requires the playing captains to go head-to-head. If that were the case, he says, European leader Mark James would have a distinct advantage. <p> " Mark 's been a wonderful player for a long time, and he still is, " Crenshaw says, " which is more than I can say these days. " <p> Ah, youth <p> Speaking of Crenshaw, he recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garcia. <p> " I was at Muirfield, and it was the first time I got to shake his hand, " Crenshaw says. " And he approaches me very respectfully and says, ' I have played well enough to be on the PGA Tour. I would like to know if you could pick me for the Ryder Cup. ' <p> " I mean, how can you not love this kid? " <p> Never mind that Crenshaw would love him a lot more if he were on the American team instead of the European squad. <p> Just in time <p> " The Ryder Cup : Golf 's Greatest Event " is a new book on the shelves that provides a comprehensive look at the history of the tournament. <p> Noted radio broadcaster Bob Bubka and longtime golf journalist Tom Clavin have combined forces to assemble an assortment of stories about the Ryder Cup, including an interview with the late Gene Sarazen, who played on the first Ryder Cup team. <p> Ben Crenshaw, the captain of this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send one to each player on his squad. <p> Sounds like a great Christmas gift for your hard-core golfer. <p> Fast money <p> The LPGA Tour 's Karrie Webb snatched another money-earning record away from Annika Sorenstam over the weekend. <p> With her second-place finish at the Samsung World Championship of Women 's Golf, Webb reached $ 4 million in earnings faster than any player in LPGA Tour history, doing so in three years, seven months and 29 days. It took Sorenstam nearly five years to make the $ 4 mil mark. This comes after Webb obliterated Sorenstam 's mark for reaching $ 3 million in March. <p> Webb also is on pace to shatter Sorenstam 's all-time low scoring average for a season. Sorenstam averaged 69.99 last year. But Webb is at 69.25 and Juli Inkster is at 69.92 with seven official events remaining. <p> Odds and ends <p> Carlos Franco, ninth on the money list, is bidding to become the first rookie to finish in the top 10 in the final cash standings since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10th.... Timing is everything. LPGA Tour veteran Kathy Postlewait retired last week at the age of 49. She earned $ 1,445,723 in a 26-year career that included four wins. Karrie Webb is $ 9,000 short of $ 1.4 million this season alone. <p> Tour Championship <p> There will be a heavy Lone Star flavor to the Tour Championship next month at Champions Golf Club. <p> Assured of spots in the $ 5 million event are natives Jeff Maggert and Justin Leonard. Also likely to hold on to a spot( he 's currently 23rd) is Bob Estes. <p> In addition, SMU graduate Payne Stewart already has qualified and there is a good chance Houston resident Steve Elkington will be playing, although he fell out of the top 30 this week. Also, two of the three winners in Texas( Stuart Appleby at the Shell Houston Open and Loren Roberts at the GTE Byron Nelson) currently are in the field. <p> Several notable players remain on the bubble for the final U.S. event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped to 31st as he did not play at the Canadian Open last week. <p> The news was much better, however, for Dennis Paulson, who climbed from 35th to 22nd thanks to his second-place finish in Canada. <p> The top-30 money-winners after the National Car Rental Classic will play in the Tour Championship on Oct. 28-31. Tickets remain at 281-893-GOLF.
