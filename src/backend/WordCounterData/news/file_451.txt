4025941 A recent Pew Forum on Religion study found nearly half of Americans have left the religion of their upbringing. Have you noticed this trend? If so, why do you think it 's so common? // -- - // A recent Pew Research study says that 44 percent of people have left the religious affiliation of their upbringing while 28 percent have left the religion. The back side of those statistics is actually pretty good news for Christian churches in a culture plagued with low-commitment and no-commitment expectations. If the findings are correct, then of the people who have been raised in a particular religion like Christianity, 72 percent remain with that religion as adults and 56 percent remain connected to their particular affiliation, whether it be Baptist, Methodist, etc. So the backside of the stats say that over seven out of 10 children in a children 's ministry environment at a local church convert and become lifelong adherents to that particular religion. If the stats are true I would say that Christian churches are doing better than just about any other institution in America in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college football fans. War Eagle and way to go Sunday School teachers! // -- - The Rev. Ben Cathey, The Orchard Church lead pastor and ministry coach // I think any religious leader who has been paying attention knows that a whole lot of people leave the religion of their upbringing, and that so many never get involved in any other religion. // This religious truancy is caused by many factors, but I refuse to believe that it 's because people are turning their back on God, as I see so many signs of people searching. I think one of the best examples of our society 's quest for God was the fad over the best selling novel, " The DaVinci Code. " // I think the sales of this book showed us all two very important things : Many people want to know more about Christianity than they do, and many of them do n't trust the Church to tell them what they want to know. // Our desire for faith has not changed, but more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clergy, misunderstood rituals, laziness, fear, intimidation or boredom, some people do n't look to the Church to help develop that faith. // But if there is a benefit to religious truancy, it is that empty pews force churches to examine themselves. We do have something vital to offer this world, and to help people hear that message many churches are preaching the gospel through word and deed in new and exciting ways. I believe that my church is a part of this new thing that God is doing, and I hope that anyone searching will stop by! // -- - The Rev. Joe Evans, Good Shepherd Presbyterian Church associate pastor // I am speaking from my own experience in teaching and working with people who come to me seeking to convert to Judaism. Some seek conversion because their spouse or " intended " is Jewish and they wish to embrace the same religion. Others come to me after having explored religions other than the one of their birth. They tell me that Judaism speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of accepting a new religious ideology, with new rituals and beliefs. It is a very courageous act because this decision affects not only themselves, but also the relationship they have with their parents and siblings. // -- - Rabbi Ronald Bluming, Temple Beth David // Three reasons immediately come to mind : 1. We live in a consumer driven culture and people like having choices and exercising choice ; 2. For a number of reasons the religions of their parents no longer resonate with them and they are looking for something that does ; and, 3. Religions tend to want to have members who serve the institution rather than think in terms of serving the constituents or others, which brings up a very important ecclesiological discussion. // -- - The Rev. Steve Wood, Mount Pisgah UMC senior pastor // How can you not notice it? Not many churches out there are full of 18-to-29-year-olds. I think it 's really pretty simple. I 've heard it said that there are only two kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty of making church irrelevant to people 's lives. This does n't have much to do with the music or dress code at a church, as much as it has to do with an attitude. We Christians can become " insider " focused and speak an " insider " language. Furthermore, we so often ignore the issues that are most relevant to the lives of everyday people, so people stop coming or do n't come at all. When we put institutionalism and ritual above the needs and concerns of the community, then we have become irrelevant. Then those who were forced to come as children will have no reason to keep coming back. God forgive us and God help us love people back into the community of faith. // -- - The Rev. Carter McInnis, Church of the Way lead pastor // What the Pew Forum study found is that half of Americans who were raised in a religious tradition have left the denomination of their childhood. This means that a person raised as a Methodist might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a fundamentalist branch of their denomination might now worship with a liberal branch of the same denomination. Further, the Pew Forum study showed that about a quarter of Americans raised in a religious tradition have made a major religious change : Christian to Buddhist, mainline Protestant to Roman Catholic, etc.( It 's important to distinguish between making a shift in your denominational affiliation and changing religious traditions ; the former is not as radical a move as " leaving your religion. ") // Yes, this trend is obvious even here in Georgia, where Protestant Christianity continues to dominate the religious demographic. I myself am no longer affiliated with the Christian denomination in which I was raised. Many of the members of my congregation grew up on other branches of the Judeo-Christian family tree. I hope it 's common because people are intentionally seeking local faith communities that strive to know and do the will of the living God. I fear that it 's common because we 21st-century Americans feel entitled to get exactly what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes it, it is imperative that churches not get caught up in recruiting each others ' members, but rather offer ourselves humbly to God 's work in this world with whomever God grants us as members and friends. To all you churchgoers out there : stay put if you can, and ask how God will use you to make God 's justice and mercy tangible in your church and in our world! // -- - The Rev. Katie Hays, Lawrenceville First Christian Church senior pastor // I think the trend is more about how denominational loyalty is no longer a reason to stay. People are looking for a faith community that speaks to their spiritual journey. In many cases faith has become so personal/private that people do n't even want to have a community. I find that sad and unbiblical. Those who followed Christ were always part of a community. They needed support and guidance from others and a place they could support others with their gifts. That has not changed. This " me and God " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hard to be in community, accepting not only those who are like us but those who differ from us. But I do believe that connecting to a faith community needs to be for more reasons than that was what my parents did. That people are asking themselves, " What do I believe? " is great. But we need others to help us find that answer. // -- - The Rev. Dale Sillik, Trinity Lutheran Pastor of Outreach // The modern world is characterized by mobility. This mobility is reflected in religious preference, among other things. In medieval times such mobility was much harder. // One 's religion was wrapped up with other parts of a person 's life : where someone lived, what somebody did for a living, who someone associated and to what government one pledged allegiance were all determined in part by religious identity. The Enlightenment in Europe and America changed this by teasing apart religion from other aspects of life to a large degree. Religious identity was seen by most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the business of the state. These leaders also thought that religion should be separate from science and other forms of knowledge, as well as from most economic activity. // In the United States the partial disentangling of religion from the state was embodied in the Constitution. One aspect of this separation was religious mobility. Very gradually people felt less constrained to move from one religious community to another, or to leave religion altogether. This became much less costly than in past centuries. This slow trend seemed to gather steam in the U.S. in the late 20th century, and may be accelerating today. // -- - Rabbi Richard Baroff, Guardians of the Torah // I have to quibble a little bit with the question. The Pew research reports that 28 percent of the respondents have left the religion of their childhood for another religion or no religion at all. That suggests that 72 percent have stayed with the religion of their childhood. Beyond that, 18 percent of Protestant respondents have switched to other denominations within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the study is that it relies upon self-reported data, which is notorious for being broad-brushed and not indicative of actual religious practice. That being said, there are many reasons why people switch religions or denominational affiliations. American society is a transient society. People do not stay in the communities of their childhood. Most people live in urban areas with massive opportunities for choice and anonymity. Interdenominational and interreligious marriages are more common than they used to be. However, as much as anything, American society is a market-driven society that places the undisciplined felt needs of consumer at the center. // As recent TV suggests, everything from family secrets to ethical conviction is for sale to the highest bidder. In a world of ever-increasing choice where consumers can mix, match, embrace today and abandon tomorrow, we should be amazed that 72 percent of respondents seem to be hanging tight with the religion of their childhoods. // -- - The Rev. Jim Street, North River Community Church pastor // Leaving the religion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since religion is often one of the strongest expressions of family identity, leaving it behind can express a desire to be one 's own person, to break free from parental control. Many young seekers are looking for authenticity. Perhaps they did not see reality in the religion of their forebears. If one 's profession is not authenticated by a changed life, then they may decide that such religion is not worth the effort. While forms and ritual hold an attraction and even a comfort to the older generation, they have little appeal to the young. Substance wins over form every time. // However, in searching for reality in all that is new and in abandoning the faith of our fathers, there is also real danger. Like the sheep who sees the grass greener in the next pasture only to be disappointed time after time, seekers often find arid pastures and dry wells. Their forays into new beliefs and practices leave them empty and discouraged, often leading to complete abandonment of all religious faith. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in God 's word. Tradition 's holding power over the young seems to be diminishing in our culture. Biblical truth boldly and clearly taught, demonstrated by consistent living is still an oasis in a thirsty land. The restless soul will only find true rest in Him. Dead religion is a poor substitute. // -- - The Rev. Dan Sweat, Berean Baptist Church senior pastor // I have noticed a trend through the years that points to a quest for authenticity. People no longer accept the faith that they were " born " into as they used to. This is a good thing because the people who come to Community of Grace have prayed, sought out, and committed to a community centered in Christ with a Lutheran perspective. When I look out into the congregation no one is there just by some accident of fate, but they are there out of a deep sense of call. People who enter our community from different backgrounds offer a deep and rich perspective on God that we are all trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of the Spirit bringing life and meaning into all denominations. // -- - The Rev. Matt Henning, Community of Grace pastor // The Bible says in Acts 2:42, 47 ; " And they continued steadfastly in the apostles ' doctrine teaching the Bible and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers... and the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved. " I am blessed to be a part of a fellowship of churches( Calvary Chapel) that is growing very rapidly. The fact of the matter is that healthy sheep reproduce. Jesus told Peter to " feed My sheep. " When God 's people are fed a steady diet of the Word( the entire Bible, not just bits and pieces) and come to a place where they are loved and cared for, they will become solid, healthy " sheep " in God 's " fold ". What happens to healthy, well fed, and well cared for sheep? They reproduce. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I have noticed it and it is very common especially as young people leave home and look for something that will meet their spiritual needs on their own level. // We live in a mobile society where people have the ability to go wherever they desire. We also live in a world where technology and communication is a major factor in peoples every day life. Some religions and churches just can not keep up with technology and the latest fads. Many young people leave because they are not loyal just for the sake of being loyal. Brand loyalty is almost a thing of the past. // There are so many choices of houses of worship and many of them major in giving people what they want and not really what they need. // I think the No. 1 reason people are leaving the religion of their upbringing is, it is not relevant nor relational. Religion in many places just does not meet the need of people. People leave the same way they arrived and there is no change or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world. // Church today has to be relevant and relational. We must connect with people in a more real, relevant and rational -- - Bishop W. Wayne Pugh, Church Alive International senior pastor, //
