4131741 Grulkefest : A Celebration of Brent honors the life and legacy of the longtime South by Southwest Music creative director who died last month at age 51. Grulke had worked for the festival since its founding in 1987. In 1994, he became the creative director, primarily overseeing the booking of acts. He expanded the number of bands that played the festival from about 500 to more than 2,000 in 2012. " A lot of Brent 's personality was in SXSW, " Roland Swenson, SXSW director and co-founder, said last month. " He was adventurous and knowledgeable and excited about creative people and endeavors. He did n't like the usual and mundane. He was open-minded enough to know that his taste was n't always the most important thing, so he was open to new things. " In the 1980s, he worked as a sound engineer for Austin bands including Alejandro Escovedo and the True Believers and co-produced a compilation of Austin groups called " Bands on the Block. " Many of those bands, including the True Believers, Doctors ' Mob, Fastball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wannabes and Wild Seeds, will perform tonight. " He was so interconnected with so many bands at the time, and still was until he died, " Austin musician Jon Dee Graham, a member of benefit headliners True Believers, said in a news release about the show. " You could n't draw a chart of his involvement because it was just too many points of reference. He was so in love with music first, and musicians next, and Austin music and musicians. More than anyone I 've ever met before or since. " The show will include a silent auction. Among the items up for bid : posters, prints, SXSW badges and wristbands, a chance to meet the Go-Go 's( at their Sept. 25 ACL Live show) and a Collings I-35 LC electric guitar( that one comes with a minimum $3,000 bid).
